### TITLE
Reasons for Faith: Philosophy in the Service of Theology - K. Scott Oliphint

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical context (early 21st century). Situated within analytic philosophy of religion and presuppositional apologetics; aims to bring rigorous philosophical method under the authority of Reformed theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Philosophy should serve theology, not replace it. Christian philosophical reflection must begin with Scripture as the controlling norm; philosophical defenses of faith must be theologically faithful and epistemically rigorous.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Affirmation of a Christian epistemology grounded in revelation; critique of autonomous natural theology.
 - Defense of presuppositional method: rational critique of non-Christian worldviews by showing their inability to account for intelligibility, morality, and rationality.
 - Positive construction of Christian philosophical commitments (God's attributes, Trinity, providence) that make sense philosophically and theologically.
 - Engagement with alternative approaches (classical apologetics, analytic theism) and defense of distinctive Reformed moves.
- **Major argumentative moves (sub-bullets):**
 - Show that non-Christian presuppositions render logic, morality, and uniformity of nature unintelligible.
 - Employ transcendental critique: Christianity as precondition of intelligibility.
 - Use philosophy to clarify and defend doctrines (e.g., divine simplicity, aseity, immutability) without sacrificing biblical fidelity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Cornelius Van Til (presuppositionalism), Alvin Plantinga and analytic philosophers, classical theists (Aquinas), Reformers (Calvin), contemporary critics of presuppositionalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and epistemology, divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), Trinity (personhood language), apologetics and the relation of faith and reason.
- **Closing line:** Oliphint insists that true philosophical rigor in service of theology is accomplished when philosophical tools are constrained by biblical revelation so that apologetics evidences the intelligibility and truth of Christian theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Explicit insistence that philosophy is a servant discipline: its methods must be subordinated to biblical truth claims.
 - Strong use of transcendental and presuppositional critiques rather than primarily evidentialist proofs.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - To classical natural theology (analogía entis): Oliphint favors analogia fidei - knowledge of God is by grace and revelation, not by purely autonomous human analogies to being.
 - To some readings of Van Til: Oliphint preserves Van Til's presuppositional core while refining certain formulations (notably on Trinitarian person-language) to avoid collapse of orthodox Trinitarian distinctions.
 - Pushback against purely analytic apologetics that detaches philosophical arguments from confessional commitments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful articulation of "philosophy in the service of theology" as a hermeneutical principle, not merely a methodological slogan.
 - Nuanced account of how divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) function within apologetic arguments.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed circles for providing an academically respectable, theologically faithful apologetic.
 - Stimulated dialogue between presuppositionalists and analytic philosophers; used as a corrective by those uneasy with pure evidentialism.
- **Enduring value:** Clarifies how to integrate careful philosophical argumentation with confessional theology; a go-to resource for seminarians and philosophers who seek a coherent Reformed philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Philosophy in the service of theology:** Philosophy as subordinate, clarificatory, and defensive of revealed truth.
- **Presuppositional apologetics:** Method that begins with the truth of Scripture as the precondition for intelligibility.
- **Transcendental critique:** Argument showing that only Christian theism can account for the possibility of rationality, moral obligation, and common sense.
- **Analogia fidei:** Knowledge of God is mediated and analogical by faith and revelation; emphasized by Oliphint over analogia entis.
 - Contrast: **Analogia entis** (analogy of being) is treated skeptically as liable to naturalistic assimilation of God to creaturely being.
- **One-person language (Van Til issue):** Discussion of Van Til's emphatic anti-syncretistic rhetoric and contested formulations about how to speak of God.
 - Oliphint preserves Van Til's anti-syncretistic intent while critiquing any formulations that risk undermining Trinitarian person distinctions.
- **Divine simplicity:** God's non-composite metaphysical unity defended as integral to biblical theism.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence as essential for grounding all dependent beings.
- **Immutability:** God's unchanging nature; Oliphint defends a classical understanding while allowing for relational action in history consistent with God's eternal will.
- **Impassibility:** Classic claim that God does not suffer passively; Oliphint negotiates this with biblical depictions of divine emotion, affirming passibility in voluntary, relational sense without defect.
- **Revelational epistemology:** Knowledge grounded in Scripture as normative for theological and philosophical claims.
- **Transcendence vs immanence:** Balancing God's otherness with his personal involvement in creation.
- **Anti-autonomy thesis:** Human reason cannot be ultimate author of norms for truth; theology governs.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for presuppositional method and "philosophy serving theology" in systematic and apologetic syllabi.
- As a **polemic** against analogia entis natural theology and against purely evidentialist apologetics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating classical divine-attribute metaphysics (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) with contemporary philosophical argumentation.
