### TITLE
The Works of Stephen Charnock (sermons and treatises on the divine attributes)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan milieu; Charnock (1628-1680) taught and preached in London; many lectures were published posthumously (notably The Existence and Attributes of God, 1682). 
 - Situated within Reformed scholasticism and Puritan pastoral theology; writing after the English Civil War and during the Restoration tensions facing nonconformists.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To demonstrate the reality, unity, and moral import of God's attributes so that right doctrine produces right worship and assurance; to defend classical theism (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) against contemporary errors.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Scriptural exposition: careful exegetical proofs for each attribute. 
 - Philosophical-theological analysis: conceptual clarification (essence vs. attributes; communicable vs. incommunicable). 
 - Practical application: pastoral implications for prayer, holiness, assurance, and worship. 
 - Repeated method: define attribute, argue from Scripture and reason, expose errors, apply to piety.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on Augustine and Calvin for exegetical precedent; uses scholastic terminology familiar from medieval and Reformation schools. 
 - Implicitly counters Romanizing sacramental or metaphysical distortions, Socinian rationalism, and popular misconceptions about God's passions and mutability.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Divine attributes in depth (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, omnipotence, omniscience, holiness, sovereignty, etc.). 
 - Intersects with trinitarian order, revelation and natural theology, providence, and soteriology insofar as attributes ground salvation and assurance.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Charnock's theological center of gravity is the insistence that the unity and immutability of God's being (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) are the metaphysical and pastoral foundation for reverent worship, doctrinal clarity, and believer assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Integrates Puritan experiential piety with rigorous metaphysical precision; attributes are not abstract but devotional loci. 
 - Repeatedly frames attributes as grounds for practical outcomes: hope, trembling, comfort, and holiness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against any theologies that sentimentalize God (attributing human passibility) or that atomize attributes into independent gods. 
 - More pastoral and devotional than some scholastics, but more philosophical and metaphysically rigorous than many devotional Puritans.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Distinctive blend of classic theistic terms (simplicity, aseity, impassibility) with vernacular pastoral application; sharp insistence that incommunicable attributes safeguard worship from creaturely idolatry.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely read in Reformed dissenting circles; became a staple in later Reformed systematic treatments of the doctrine of God. 
 - Influential for ministers and theologians seeking a marriage of doctrinal precision and pastoral use; cited in subsequent Anglican and Presbyterian teaching.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how to do attributes-theology that is simultaneously exegetical, philosophical, and pastoral. 
 - Valuable as a corrective to sloppy popular piety and to dry abstract metaphysics: it keeps doctrine lively and worshipful.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God is not compositionally made of parts; attributes are identical with God's essence. Used to ground unity and to avoid polytheism of attributes.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence. Emphasized as the source of all being and assurance that God needs nothing from creation.
- **Immutability:** God does not change in essence, will, or purpose. Used to secure the reliability of promises and the stability of providence.
- **Impassibility:** God is not subject to involuntary passions or moral change. Emphasized to preserve divine sovereignty and holiness.
- **Communicable vs. Incommunicable attributes:** Distinguishes attributes humans may reflect (wisdom, goodness) from those reserved to God (aseity, simplicity).
- **Holiness:** Central moral attribute binding other attributes into ethical demand; grounds divine opposition to sin and the call to sanctification.
- **Sovereignty:** Divine rule over all events; grounded in simplicity and immutability, used pastorally to comfort under providential trials.
- **Omnipotence / Omniscience:** Treated not merely as lists of perfections but as interrelated aspects of one simple divine being.
- **Essence-Attributes relation:** Uses scholastic vocabulary to avoid reifying attributes as separable entities.
- **Analogical language about God:** Maintains that human language is analogical; affirms knowability but insists on creaturely limitation.
- **Revelation and Natural Theology:** Argues for God's knowability both from Scripture and creation, but places Scripture as decisive for attributes' moral implications.
- **Pastoral application:** Attributes function as direct grounds for prayer, assurance, and ethical exhortation.
- **Polemic use:** Employed against Socinian denial of deity or Arminian distortions of providence; defends orthodox divine simplicity and passivity.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for classical theistic terms in systematic theology courses. 
 - As a **polemic and apologetic** resource against emotionalist or rationalist errors about God's passions and dependence. 
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** showing how to derive sanctified living and assurance from reflection on divine attributes.
