### TITLE
**Created in God's Image (De Mensch, 1888; English translation: Created in God's Image) - Abraham Kuyper**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1888 amid Dutch Neo-Calvinist renewal; Kuyper writing as pastor, politician and theologian reacting to 19th-century naturalism, historicism, and liberal theology.
 - Moves to defend a Reformed, biblically rooted anthropology that addresses modern philosophical threats (materialism, reductionism) and social implications of human dignity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The human being is created in the image of God (imago Dei); this imago is the basis for human dignity, vocation, and moral responsibility. Kuyper seeks to articulate what the image is ontologically and functionally, and how fall and redemption affect it.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening on Genesis 1:26-27 to establish biblical warrant for imago Dei as relational and functional (reigning vocation, representation).
 - Anthropological analysis distinguishing faculties (intellect, will, conscience) while insisting on the unity of the person (psychosomatic unity).
 - Polemic against both crude trichotomy (soul-spirit-body as three separate substances) and materialist monism; offers a nuanced account that recognizes spiritual reality without fragmenting personal unity.
 - Soteriological extension: fall corrupts the image; Christ restores and perfects the image in redeemed humanity; sanctification is renewal of the imago in the believer.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (Genesis, Pauline anthropology), Reformation authorities (especially Calvinic emphases), patristic and medieval reflection on imago Dei, and modern philosophers/critics (representative naturalists, some German theologians of the period).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Imago Dei (central), anthropology (creation, fall, sin, redemption), Christology (recapitulation/restoration of the image), Spirit (regeneration), ethics and social implications (vocation, human rights implied).
- **Selected topical references within the work**
 - **Image of God:** Kuyper's exegetical and theological case for the imago as relational-function (see sections on Genesis exposition).
 - **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy:** Kuyper's critique of crude trichotomy and defense of a moderated dichotomy/functional differentiation among soul and spirit.
 - **Psychosomatic Unity:** Kuyper's insistence that human personhood is an integrated soul-body unity (see sections analyzing bodily-personal unity and anti-materialist arguments).
- **Closing line**
 - Kuyper centers theological anthropology on a biblically grounded imago Dei that affirms human worth, preserves personal unity, and locates salvation as renewal of the whole human person in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Treats the imago Dei both as **relational-representative** (humanity stands for God in creation) and as a **functional capacity** (capacity for dominion, moral knowledge, and communion).
 - Strong integration of theological anthropology with cultural vocation - dignity yields public and social obligations.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Enlightenment/modern reductionism by insisting on nonreducible spiritual dimensions without adopting an atomistic tripartite ontology.
 - Contrasts with some pietistic and mystic tendencies by rooting sanctification and image-restoration in corporate and societal as well as individual terms.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes **psychosomatic complex** language to avoid mere dualism while still affirming spiritual faculties.
 - Frames imago as both ontological status and ethical-functional vocation (bridging classic structural and functional models).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Neo-Calvinist circles and later Reformed social theology; used to argue for human dignity in social policy, education, and cultural engagement.
 - Cited in modern debates on imago Dei, especially by theologians seeking a middle path between materialism and speculative trichotomy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful, biblically attentive, and culturally engaged model for anthropology; valuable for courses on imago Dei, Reformed doctrine of humanity, and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - central category; both relational (to God) and functional (representation, dominion, moral capacity).
- **Imago relationalis** - emphasis on humans in relation to God and others; social and covenantal implications.
- **Imago functionalis** - image as vocation/office (stewardship, moral agency).
- **Psychosomatic unity** - human person as integrated body-soul unity; resists fragmenting personhood.
- **Soul vs. Spirit** - Kuyper distinguishes faculties (spiritual/intellectual/moral) but resists threefold ontological partition; prefers a functional distinction within unity.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy** - Kuyper critiques crude trichotomy, opting for nuanced functional distinctions compatible with personal unity.
- **Original righteousness / corruption** - image originally oriented to God; fall distorts but does not annihilate the image.
- **Regeneration / renewal of the image** - soteriological focus: Christ restores the imago in believers and in Christ as archetype.
- **Vocation / dominion** - practical outworking of image in cultural, societal, and ecological stewardship.
- **Anthropological anthropology** - Kuyper's terming of a theology of the whole human person, integrating ontology and ethics.
- **Non-reductionist anti-materialism** - polemic posture against naturalistic reduction of persons to matter or mechanism.
- **Representative/functionalist language** - avoids purely structural definitions; links image to office and relationship.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for imago Dei debates (bridging structural and functional models).
- As a **polemic** against materialism and crude trichotomy in systematic theology and apologetics.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating anthropology with ethics, social teaching, and doctrines of sin and redemption.
