### TITLE
Knowledge of God: Protestant Perspectives - Michael Allen (in The Oxford Handbook of the Epistemology of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic and confessional conversation (21st-century Protestant theology intersecting with analytic epistemology).
 - Situated within Oxford Handbook project: survey of epistemology of theology across traditions with a priority on method and interdisciplinary engagement.
 - Milieu: Reformed/Protestant retrieval of doctrinal sources (Calvin, Protestant scholastics) in dialogue with modern epistemologists (Plantinga, contemporary internalists/externalists).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Protestant knowledge of God is properly understood as a disciplineally governed theological epistemology: knowledge rooted in divine self-revelation (Scripture and Spirit), yet intelligible to philosophical epistemic norms.
 - Key problem: how to secure theological claims as both confessing (faith-committed) and epistemically warranted (not merely fideistic or naively propositional).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose contemporary options: reductive naturalism, strict evidentialism, fideism, and Reformed externalist proposals (e.g., Plantinga).
 - Reclaim Protestant resources as epistemic principia:
 - Scripture as normative propositional locus of revelation (sola Scriptura as epistemic principle).
 - Holy Spirit/illumination and covenantal practices as guarantors of warrant for believers.
 - Theological method conceived as a disciplined science ("theologia as scientia") that orders first principles to provide coherent knowledge claims.
 - Synthesize analytic categories (warrant, justification, belief) with doctrinal categories (revelation, covenant, incarnation).
 - Advocate a model that affirms both **propositional** content and **non-propositional** modes of knowing (assurance, ecclesial knowledge, doxastic formation).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: John Calvin, Augustine, Reformed scholastic sources.
 - Contemporary: Alvin Plantinga (Reformed epistemology), Karl Barth, John Webster, contemporary epistemologists (debates internalism/externalism).
 - Secondary interlocutors: evidentialist critics and proponents of theological naturalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), Scripture (normativity and sufficiency), Holy Spirit (illumination and assurance), Trinity (implications for doxology and knowledge), Christology (incarnational epistemology), ecclesiology and covenant (mediated knowledge), soteriology (assurance as epistemic state).

- **Closing line**
 - Allen centers a Protestant epistemology of God on the marriage of confessional first principles (Word and Spirit) with disciplined epistemic standards, defending theology as a principled science that yields warranted, communal, and incarnational knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes theology as an ordered "science" with principia grounded in revelation rather than in autonomous philosophical foundations.
 - Stresses the inseparability of propositional content and ecclesial, Spirit-wrought assurance in Christian knowing.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects simplistic readings of Plantinga by insisting on stronger ecclesial and scriptural norms rather than a purely doxastic warrant grounded only in sensus divinitatis.
 - Counters both strict evidentialism and fideism: rejects evidentialist reduction of theology to secular proof and rejects fideistic anti-intellectualism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing of "principia" (first theological principles) as both confessional norms and epistemic foundations - a bridge term linking doctrinal authority and epistemic methodology.
 - Emphasis on "incarnational epistemology": knowledge of God mediated through Word and sacramental/communally embodied practices.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in Reformed and evangelical academic contexts seeking to combine confessional fidelity with analytic rigor.
 - Cited in discussions on theological method, Reformed epistemology reformulations, and curricular reform in systematic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact model for teaching theological epistemology that is doctrinally rooted and philosophically conversant.
 - Serves as a pragmatic template for integrating confessional commitments with contemporary epistemic criteria.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia (theological first principles)** - Scriptural and confessional starting points that order theological inquiry.
- **Revelation (special & general)** - God's self-disclosure; special revelation (Scripture/Christ) is epistemically primary for theology.
- **Sola Scriptura (normative Scripture)** - Scripture as the normative epistemic rule for doctrine and warrant.
- **Holy Spirit / illumination** - Spirit's role in certifying and forming believer's knowledge and assurance.
- **Sensus divinitatis** - innate orientation to God (discussed in relation to Plantinga; not sufficient alone without scriptural mediation).
- **Warranted Christian belief** - epistemic goal: belief that is both true (insofar as theology aims at truth) and rightly warranted by principia.
- **Incarnational epistemology** - knowledge of God mediated through the incarnate Word, sacraments, and embodied ecclesial life.
- **Theology as scientia** - disciplined, principled, systematic enterprise with normative foundations.
- **Propositional vs. non-propositional knowing** - balancing doctrinal assertions with experiential/assurance knowledge in believers.
- **Covenant epistemology** - knowledge formed and sustained within covenantal/communal practices of the church.
- **Assurance (epistemic assurance)** - faith's confidence that functions as both soteriological and epistemic state.
- **Internalism / Externalism** - analytic epistemic debates appropriated to theological contexts (how warrant is secured).
- **Doxastic practices** - ecclesial habits and disciplines that shape justified theological belief.
- **Normative vs. descriptive theological epistemology** - Allen's move is primarily normative: how theology should secure knowledge.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for principled Protestant theological method (useful in methodology courses).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Reformed confessional resources to analytic epistemology (used in debates over divine revelation and warrant).
 - As a **polemic resource** against both secularizing epistemologies and fideistic tendencies within evangelicalism.
