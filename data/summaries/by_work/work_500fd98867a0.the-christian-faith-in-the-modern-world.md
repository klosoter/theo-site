### TITLE
**The Christian Faith in the Modern World** (J. Gresham Machen)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-1930s radio addresses amid the Fundamentalist-Modernist controversy; Machen recently departed Old Princeton to found Westminster Theological Seminary. American Presbyterian conflicts (Auburn Affirmation, mission boards) and European theological currents (Kant, Ritschl, liberal historicism, early dialectical theology) form the backdrop.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Historic, confessional Christianity is grounded in divinely given revelation and public, historical facts centering on Christ; it is neither reducible to ethics nor private religious experience. Scripture is a self-attesting, Spirit-witnessed authority; the gospel requires repentance and faith and creates the one catholic church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Revelation and God:** God is knowable because He reveals Himself in general and special revelation; agnostic limits on reason do not cancel revelation.
 - **Scripture:** Plenary inspiration and inerrancy secure the trustworthiness of the biblical witness; Scripture bears divine authority and is recognized by the Spirit.
 - **Christology:** The person and work of Christ are historical realities (virgin birth, miracles, resurrection) that ground doctrine.
 - **Atonement:** Necessity of penal, substitutionary death to satisfy divine justice and reconcile sinners; cross and resurrection as objective accomplishment.
 - **Faith and repentance:** Evangelical faith receives Christ and His benefits; repentance is inseparable, Spirit-wrought turning from sin.
 - **Church:** The gospel creates the one, holy, catholic, apostolic church, marked by Word, sacrament, and discipline; Reformation ecclesiology safeguards catholicity without capitulating to modernism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Positively, Calvin, the Westminster Standards, Old Princeton (Hodge, Warfield). Critically, Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Harnack, pragmatists (James, Dewey), higher criticism, and diffuse modernism; cautious toward neo-orthodox ambiguities.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration/inerrancy, existence and knowability of God, Christology (incarnation, resurrection), atonement, faith and repentance, ecclesiology (nature, marks, catholicity), sacraments as means of grace.
- **Closing line:** Christianity stands or falls with what God has done in history in Jesus Christ, attested by Scripture, received by faith, and embodied in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Facts before feelings:** The gospel is news about events producing experience, not experience seeking stories.
 - **Old Princeton method in pastoral key:** A blend of historical-apologetic reasoning with confessional piety, made accessible for laity via radio.
 - **Churchly horizon:** Defense of doctrine ordered toward the visible church's worship, mission, and discipline.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against liberalism's reduction of Christianity to ethics or religious consciousness.
 - Against pragmatism's truth-as-utility and Kantian agnosticism about God-in-Himself.
 - Against anti-intellectual pietism that divorces faith from history and doctrine.
 - Against ecclesial latitudinarianism that sacrifices confessional identity for unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No novelty in dogma; rather, a sharpened articulation of **self-attestation** and the Spirit's **internal testimony** alongside historical evidences.
 - Reassertion of Reformation **marks of the church** as truly catholic in contrast to modernist broad-church claims.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical within conservative Presbyterian and broader Reformed circles; shaped Westminster Seminary and OPC identity.
 - A touchstone in bibliology and ecclesiology debates; cited for clarity on inspiration, authority, and the church.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of how to argue that Christianity is true and public, not private and optional.
 - Catechetical usefulness for faith-repentance, atonement, and the marks of the church.
 - Durable antidote to recurring subjectivist and reductionist theologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plenary inspiration:** Whole Bible is God-breathed; basis for doctrinal confidence and preaching.
- **Inerrancy (autographic):** Scripture speaks truth in all it affirms; harmonizes with careful historical study.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture:** The Bible bears God's own authority; recognized, not bestowed, by the church.
 - **Internal testimony of the Spirit:** The Spirit illumines believers to receive Scripture's divine voice.
- **General and special revelation:** Creation and conscience reveal God; Scripture and Christ clarify saving truth.
- **Historical facticity:** Miracles, incarnation, cross, resurrection as public events grounding faith.
 - Contrasts with mythic or merely symbolic accounts of Jesus.
- **Penal substitution and propitiation:** Christ bears the penalty of sin, satisfying divine justice and wrath.
- **Faith and repentance:** Twin graces; faith rests on Christ, repentance turns from sin; inseparable in conversion.
- **Assurance:** Rooted objectively in Christ's finished work and promises, not subjective fluctuation.
- **One, holy, catholic, apostolic church:** Unity and universality defined by gospel truth, not institutional breadth alone.
- **Marks of the church:** Pure preaching of the Word, right administration of sacraments, and faithful discipline.
- **Means of grace:** Word and sacraments as Spirit-used instruments to create and sustain faith.
- **Confessionalism:** Binding subordinate standards faithfully summarize Scripture's teaching for church life.
- **Noetic effects of sin:** Sin distorts reason, necessitating revelation and regeneration for true knowledge.
- **Modernism/liberalism:** Theological movement reducing Christianity to ethics or experience; target of Machen's critique.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a concise source in **bibliology** for defining inspiration, inerrancy, and authority.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal and pragmatist reductions of the gospel.
 - As a **historical-apologetic model** for arguing the gospel's public truth.
 - As an **ecclesiological primer** on catholicity, marks, and confessional identity.
