### TITLE
**Anselm: Basic Writings (trans. S. N. Deane) - primary: Cur Deus Homo; supplementary: Proslogion, Monologion, De Veritate, De Libertate Arbitrii**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 11th-early 12th century Canterbury; Benedictine monastic theologian operating at the cusp of medieval scholasticism.
 - Intellectual milieu: patristic exegesis (Augustine), rudimentary scholastic logic, reaction against emerging nominalist/moralist trends (Abelard).
 - S. N. Deane translation collects Anselm's key philosophical-theological treatises for anglophone readers.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Principal problem framed in Cur Deus Homo: *Why did God become man?* - specifically, what made Christ's incarnation and death necessary for human salvation?
 - Focused doctrinal problem: the necessity and mechanism of atonement - how divine justice/honor is satisfied so sinners may be pardoned.

- **Core argument / structure (Condensed)**
 - Sin constitutes an offense against God's honor and order that generates a debt - absence of satisfaction threatens cosmic justice.
 - Humans cannot make adequate satisfaction because the injury is infinite (offense against God) and their merits are insufficient.
 - Either God punishes sinners (which would satisfy justice but destroy humanity) or accepts satisfaction; God, in mercy, provides a means to satisfy justice without annihilating the guilty.
 - Only a being both divine and human can provide infinite satisfaction and restore order: therefore God becomes man in Christ.
 - Christ's voluntary passion and restitution perform the requisite satisfaction, enabling forgiveness while preserving divine righteousness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogical interlocutor: Boso (fictional) in Cur Deus Homo to crystallize objections.
 - Scriptural argumentation combined with Augustine and patristic authorities; polemical contrast with Abelard's moral influence model.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Atonement (central), Christology (God-man necessity), sin (offense and debt), divine justice/rightness, grace, merit, human will and inability.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Anselm insists that atonement is required not merely to secure pardon but to **restore divine honor and order**, and that only the God-man could rightly and sufficiently provide that restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Atonement framed as **satisfaction of honor/justice** rather than primarily juridical penalty or moral persuasion.
 - Explicit logical proof structure: establishes premises (nature of sin, insufficiency of man, necessity of a fitting satisfier) and derives incarnation as the only solution.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Direct corrective to Abelard: rejects moral exemplar theory (atonement as moral influence) as insufficient to account for divine justice and the necessity of satisfaction.
 - Draws on Augustine but shifts language from guilt/punishment to **debt and honor**, creating a more systematized economic theology of salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Introduces and canonicalizes the technical vocabulary of **"satisfaction"** in Latin theological discourse.
 - Reframes merit and compensation in economical terms (debt, payment, adequate compensator).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became the medieval standard for most scholastics; heavily adapted by Thomas Aquinas and later reformulations.
 - Reformation appropriation: Reformers (esp. Luther and Calvin) read Anselm through penal-legal lenses, sometimes conflating satisfaction with penal substitution; this yields both appropriation and contestation.
 - Modern critics and defenders debate whether Anselm anticipates penal substitution or articulates a distinct non-penal satisfaction model.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides the clearest medieval philosophical account of why incarnation/atonement are metaphysically necessary.
 - Essential classroom text for debates on **necessity**, **scope**, and **mechanism** of atonement; indispensable for tracing development from patristic to scholastic and Reformation theories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Satisfaction** - central technical term: a compensatory act that restores what sin has dishonored; not identical with penal suffering.
- **Honor (honorific order)** - the moral order and divine dignity offended by sin; demands restoration.
- **Debt / Compensation** - sin creates a debt that must be discharged; frames atonement as payment rather than only pardon.
- **Necessity (of the Incarnation)** - Anselm argues a conditional necessity: given God's nature and the reality of offended honor, incarnation is the fitting means to satisfy.
- **God-man (Deus homo)** - Christ as the sole creature who can unite infinite dignity with human status to make adequate satisfaction.
- **Substitution** - Christ acts in place of sinners to make satisfaction; substitutionary language is used but not identical to later penal formulations.
- **Magnitude / adequacy of satisfaction** - the offense is infinite (against God), so satisfaction must be infinite; Christ's divine person supplies infinite value.
- **Divine justice vs mercy** - tension resolved by a satisfaction that upholds justice while enabling mercy; Anselm preserves both attributes.
- **Merit (deservedness)** - merits can be applied vicariously; Christ's merit goes beyond human capacity.
- **Impossibility of human satisfaction** - humans lack both the moral worth and infinite magnitude to repair offended honor.
- **Voluntariness / Will** - Christ's willing obedience is essential; satisfaction is not coercive but deliberate and meritorious.
- **Cur Deus Homo (treatise)** - the locus classicus for Anselm's atonement theory; primary reference for necessity/extensiveness debates.
- **Contrast: Moral Influence vs Satisfaction** - Anselm decisively rejects purely moral-influence explanations as inadequate to address divine justice.
- **Relation to Penal Substitution** - useful historical pivot: Anselm supplies vocabulary later read legally by Reformers; care required not to conflate terminologies.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the medieval satisfaction theory of atonement and for clarifying "why God became man."
 - As a **polemic model** against moral-exemplar views (useful in debates on efficacy and necessity).
 - As an **exegetical/philosophical model** for integrating metaphysical claims (divine attributes) with soteriology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking patristic intuitions about sin and grace to later scholastic and Reformation formulations.
