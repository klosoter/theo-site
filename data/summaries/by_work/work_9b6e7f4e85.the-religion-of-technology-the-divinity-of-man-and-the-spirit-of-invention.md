### TITLE
The Religion of Technology: The Divinity of Man and the Spirit of Invention - David F. Noble

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century critique of modernity and industrial society: emerges amid postwar technological expansion, rising computerization, managerial capitalism, and intensified debates about secularization and technocracy.
 - Positioned within history of technology and social critique rather than systematic theology; conversant with social theorists (Weber, Marx), critics of technique (Ellul, Mumford), and histories of invention.
- **Central thesis**
 - Technology in modern Western society functions as a **religion**: it sacralizes human inventive power, institutes priests (engineers/inventors/managerial elites), and promotes an eschatology of progress. Central claim: modern culture worships the **divinity of man** expressed through the "spirit of invention."
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: traces cultural narratives that elevate invention to sacred status - inventor-as-prophet, invention-as-revelation, progress-as-salvation.
 - Genealogy: locates roots in Enlightenment and Protestant currents (anthropocentrism, voluntarism, vocation), capitalist commodification, and institutional development of research labs and corporations.
 - Institutionalization: shows how universities, corporations, government agencies and professional associations create the sacerdotal roles and rituals of technology.
 - Consequences: analyzes moral, political, and theological consequences - idolatry, displacement of traditional religious authority, redefinition of providence and eschatology in technical terms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages historiography of technology and social theory: Francis Bacon and Enlightenment instrumentalism, Weberian rationalization, Marxist critiques of labor and capital.
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with Jacques Ellul, Lewis Mumford, and critics of technological determinism.
- **Doctrines treated (theological lenses applied)**
 - **Imago Dei**: reinterpreted as human creative/divine agency invested in technical mastery.
 - **Idolatry**: technology as object of worship and replacement theology.
 - **Providence and teleology**: progress narrative as secular providence; invention as mediating salvation.
 - **Eschatology**: technological utopianism functions as a civil-religious eschatology.
 - **Authority and priesthood**: engineers and managers as a new sacerdotal caste.
- **Closing line**
 - Noble's theological center: modern technology is not merely instrumental but sacramentalized - it erects a secular religion in which human inventiveness assumes divine status and reshapes moral and political life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames technology explicitly in religious terms (rituals, priesthood, eschatology) rather than only as social practice or deterministic process.
 - Emphasizes the *anthropotheistic* element - the elevation of human agency to divine status - rather than portraying technology as autonomous force.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Ellul's thesis of technique as autonomous and self-propagating by stressing the cultural and theological investment in human inventors and institutions.
 - Differs from purely political-economy critiques by centering symbolic, religious dimensions (sacral language, ritual legitimation).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Divinity of man" and "spirit of invention" as analytic categories to explain why technological endeavor acquires moral and soteriological weight.
 - Treats inventors and technical institutions as sacerdotal actors within a civil religion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in history of technology, science-and-technology studies (STS), and religious studies as a provocative interpretive frame.
 - Adopted by theologians and ethicists concerned with idolatry and secularization, though less often integrated into confessional dogmatic systems (e.g., Reformed systematic theology) as a canonical text.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a sturdy interpretive lens for contemporary debates on AI, biotech, and transhumanism by foregrounding the religious dynamics of technological enthusiasm.
 - Useful for courses and research intersecting theology, ethics, and STS as a model of cultural-theological analysis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religion of technology** - The thesis that technological practice and rhetoric function as a religion with beliefs, rituals, priests, and eschatology.
- **Divinity of man** - The elevation of human inventiveness and creativity to divine status; anthropotheism implicit in technological culture.
- **Spirit of invention** - The quasi-spiritual drive to create, innovate, and perfect via technology; functions as vocation and calling.
- **Inventor-as-priest** - The social role that grants moral and authoritative status to engineers, scientists, and corporate R&D leaders.
- **Sacralization** - The process by which secular institutions and practices are endowed with sacred meaning and legitimacy.
- **Technological eschatology** - The belief that progress in technology will culminate in salvation or perfected human condition.
- **Idolatry (technological)** - The theological diagnosis that technology serves as an object of worship, displacing God or traditional sacral orders.
- **Secular providence/progress** - The reworking of providential language into narratives of progress and human mastery.
- **Institutional priesthood** - Corporations, universities, governmental agencies forming the organizational backbone of the religion of technology.
- **Anthropocentrism (reinvented)** - A theological anthropology that locates ultimate meaning in human mastery rather than creaturely dependence.
- **Rituals of innovation** - Practices (product launches, trade shows, patent ceremonies) that operate like religious rites.
- **Technocratic authority** - The legitimation of policy and moral norms by technical expertise and managerial competence.
- **Contrast: autonomy of technique** - Ellul-style claim that technique operates independently vs. Noble's claim that technique is invested with religious meaning by humans.
- **Civil religion** - The overlay of national/cultural sacral narratives with technological myth-making.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for arguments that see technology as a cultural religion and for classroom modules on religion and modernity.
 - As a **polemic** in theological ethics against technological utopianism and anthropotheism (useful in critiques of transhumanism).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in STS and political theology to analyze institutional formation of technocratic authority and the sacred status of innovation.
