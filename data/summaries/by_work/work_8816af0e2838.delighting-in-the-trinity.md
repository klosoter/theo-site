### TITLE
Delighting in the Trinity - Michael Reeves

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 21st century within an evangelical/Anglican-reformed milieu seeking to recover classical Trinitarian doctrine as central to worship, discipleship, and theology; part of a broader evangelical revival of patristic and Trinitarian resources against privatized, therapeutic, or purely forensic Christianities.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian theology and life should be rooted in delighting in the Triune God: correct Trinitarian doctrine is not an abstract metaphysical exercise but the theological ground for worship, love, knowledge of God, and mission.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary Christianity often treats God as remote, functional, or a proposition rather than a Triune Person to be delighted in.
 - Theological exposition: reconstruction of orthodox Trinitarian doctrine (persons, relations, perichoresis, distinction of immanent and economic Trinity) with pastoral emphasis.
 - Practical appropriation: how Trinitarian reality shapes Christian life - worship (doxology), knowledge of God, prayer, sanctification, church life, and mission.
 - Pastoral application: cultivating delight in God as the engine of Christian life; theology leading to doxology and formation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy appeal to the Cappadocians (Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus), Augustine, the Reformation tradition (Calvinic emphases on God's sovereignty and knowledge of God), and selected modern interlocutors (Barth and recent evangelical authors). Uses Scripture as primary warrant; engages modern deviations (e.g., depersonalizing metaphysics, reductive social trinitarianism) implicitly or explicitly.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (central), revelation, knowledge of God, divine love, perichoresis, personhood and relations, Christology and Sonship as revelation of the Father, Spirit and sanctification, ecclesiology and worship, mission.
- **Closing line:** The living, loving, tri-personal God is both the object and origin of Christian delight; orthodox Trinitarian doctrine must be recovered not merely for right belief but to recover doxological life and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Positions *delight* (joy/worship) as the normative telos of theology; doctrine's chief purpose is to draw worshipful affection toward the Triune God.
 - Balances analytic doctrinal clarity with accessible pastoral application - doctrinal precision serving liturgical and spiritual formation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects abstractions that render God as an impersonal substance or mere set of attributes; critiques both modalism and simplistic "social Trinity" caricatures that risk ditinguishing persons without unity.
 - Counters privatized, utilitarian spirituality by reorienting Christian life around communal, Triune love.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-linguifies doctrinal categories in affective and devotional terms (e.g., "knowing" as delight; perichoresis as mutual joy), without inventing new dogma.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries, churches, and small groups as a readable corrective and primer on Trinitarian theology; praised for bridging academic Trinitarianism and popular piety.
 - Influential in prompting renewed attention to Trinitarian worship and formation among Anglophone evangelicals.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact, pastorally oriented reintroduction to classical Trinitarianism that is useful for preaching, discipleship, and beginner-to-intermediate theological instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity:** One God in three persons; central reality shaping theology and life.
- **Personhood (Father, Son, Spirit):** Distinct personal life within one divine being - grounds for relational theology and worship.
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling/interpenetration of the persons; used here to explain internal divine communion as the basis for love and mission.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity:** Distinction upheld - God's outward works reveal but do not exhaust God's inner life; used to avoid reductionism.
- **Delight:** Affectional response and telos of theological knowledge; theology-as-doxology.
- **Doxology:** Praise/worship as the primary human response and measure of doctrinal health.
- **Divine love:** The intra-Trinitarian life as the ontological ground for human love and mission.
- **Revelation:** Scripture as witness to the tri-personal God; revelation frames doctrinal claims as relational, not merely speculative.
- **Knowledge of God:** Knowing = delight and communion, not just propositional assent.
- **Mission:** Flowing from Trinitarian love - church's sending rooted in the sending of the Son and Spirit.
- **Perichoretic holiness/sanctification:** Sanctification shaped by participation in Trinitarian life.
- **Worship formation:** Liturgical and catechetical implications - teaching congregations to see worship as relational delight.
- **Pastoral theology:** Doctrine translated into habits of prayer, preaching, and communal life.
- **Anti-reductionism:** Polemic posture against treating God as a problem-solver or metaphysical abstraction.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and accessible primer for what orthodox Trinitarian doctrine entails and why it matters.
- As a **polemic and corrective** against privatized, pragmatic, or non-Trinitarian forms of Christianity.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching and discipleship that makes doctrine conduce to worship and spiritual formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula to re-center Christian life and mission around the intra-Trinitarian life.
