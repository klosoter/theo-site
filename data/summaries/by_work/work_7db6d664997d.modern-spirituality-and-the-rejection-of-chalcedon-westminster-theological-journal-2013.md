### TITLE
Modern Spirituality and the Rejection of Chalcedon (Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published in a Reformed academic venue addressing contemporary shifts in Christian spirituality in the late 20th-early 21st centuries. 
 - Engages a milieu shaped by pietism, charismatic movements, Romantic subjectivism, and some strands of evangelicalism that privilege experience over received doctrine.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Poythress contends that certain forms of modern spirituality effectively reject the Chalcedonian Definition by collapsing or relativizing the orthodox distinction between Christ's two natures, with theological and pastoral consequences.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnoses modern spirituality as privileging subjective experience and function over classical ontological categories. 
 - Shows how this epistemic posture encourages reinterpretations of Christology that blur the Chalcedonian articulation of one person in two natures. 
 - Demonstrates theological consequences: loss of credible atonement, confusion about the incarnation, and vulnerability to ancient heresies recast in modern idioms. 
 - Offers a corrective: recover the normative status of Chalcedon and rehabilitate the role of doctrinal language in shaping Christian experience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Appeals to the Chalcedonian fathers (implicitly Cyril and Leo) and the historic creedal tradition as normative benchmarks. 
 - Interacts critically with streams in modern theology and spirituality that emphasize subjective encounter (pietistic, Romantic, and some charismatic expressions). 
 - Uses analytic and Reformed theological resources to defend doctrinal integrity.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Primary:** Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, person of Christ). 
 - **Secondary:** Revelation and the relation of doctrine to spiritual experience; indirect implications for atonement and mediation.

- **Closing line:** 
 - Poythress argues that recovering Chalcedon is essential both for coherent Christology and for a spirituality that is doctrinally rooted rather than experientially untethered.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasizes the epistemic roots of doctrinal erosion: modern spirituality's privileging of subjective knowing leads to anti-Chalcedonian tendencies. 
 - Frames Chalcedon not merely as historical dogma but as a necessary linguistic and ontological guardrail for authentic Christian spirituality.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Contrasts classical creedal confidence with modern tendencies to reinterpret doctrine in functional or experiential categories. 
 - Counters theological moves that reduce Christology to functions (what Christ does) rather than affirming the ontological reality of two natures in one person.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Recasts debates over "experience vs. doctrine" as a Christological fault-line rather than only an epistemological dispute. 
 - Emphasizes interplay between hermeneutics of experience and classical metaphysical categories in maintaining orthodox belief.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Resonates in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles concerned about experiential excess and doctrinal decline. 
 - Serves as a touchstone for further critique of therapeutic and purely experiential spirituality in academic and pastoral contexts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Useful model for connecting historical dogma to contemporary spiritual practice. 
 - Provides a disciplined framework for pastors and teachers to critique charismatic/pietistic excesses without rejecting genuine spiritual experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** 
 - The fourth‑century formula affirming one person of Christ in two natures, **without confusion, change, division, or separation**; treated as normative corrective.

- **Hypostatic union:** 
 - Technical term for the personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; Poythress insists on its non-negotiable role for orthodox spirituality.

- **Two natures doctrine (divine/human):** 
 - Distinction upheld against functional or existential reductions that collapse natures into a spiritualized unity.

- **Modern spirituality:** 
 - Broad label for contemporary currents that prioritize subjective encounter, therapeutic religion, and experiential verification over creedal formulations.

- **Subjectivism/experientialism:** 
 - Epistemic posture that places inward experience as primary norm; shown to produce doctrinal drift in Christology.

- **Functional Christology:** 
 - Tendency to define Christ by roles/works (exemplar, teacher, healer) rather than by ontological union; identified as a symptom of Chalcedonian rejection.

- **Ontological vs. functional categories:** 
 - Contrast Poythress stresses: doctrine must secure ontological claims (what Christ is) before functional descriptions (what Christ does).

- **Revelation as propositional vs. experiential:** 
 - Poythress defends the priority of propositional, creedal revelation as the interpretive lens for experience.

- **Ancient heresies (implicit contrasts):** 
 - Apollinarianism, Nestorianism, Eutychianism invoked as historical parallels to modern errors in new vocabulary.

- **Normativity of doctrine:** 
 - The claim that creeds like Chalcedon function as formative norms for both belief and piety.

- **Spiritual formation anchored in doctrine:** 
 - Practical thesis: healthy formation integrates orthodox Christology with genuine spiritual life.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **polemic** against experientialist or therapeutic spirituality that minimizes doctrine. 
- As a **definition source** for defending Chalcedonian contours in contemporary Christological debates. 
- As an **exegetical/conceptual model** linking epistemology (how we know) with Christology (who Christ is) in theological curricula.
