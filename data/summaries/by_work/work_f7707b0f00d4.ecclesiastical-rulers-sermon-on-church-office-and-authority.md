### TITLE
**"Ecclesiastical Rulers" - Robert L. Dabney (sermon on church office and authority)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid to late 19th century American Presbyterian context; Dabney a leading Southern Presbyterian theologian and pastor, writing amid post-Reformation confessional conflicts, revivalist pressures, and debates over church polity.
 - Work functions as pastoral-theological instruction and polemic within Presbyterian circles defending ordered authority and discipline against both radical voluntarism and episcopal/Erastian encroachments.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian church requires divinely instituted, ordered rulers (elders, ministers) whose authority-rooted in Scripture and covenant life-secures truth, sacraments, and discipline for the visible church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: New Testament warrant for eldership/bishopric and the plurality of elders; office as instituted by Christ and apostles.
 - Historical-theological claim: continuity of presbyterial governance in Reformed tradition; critique of congregationalist individualism and hierarchical episcopacy.
 - Functional delineation: offices defined (teaching and ruling elders, ministers), ordination as sacramental/ceremonial recognition of divine call, limits and scope of jurisdiction.
 - Practical consequences: necessity of church courts (session, presbytery, assembly), regular discipline, protection against error and schism.
 - Pastoral caveat: authority exercised in service, not tyranny; rulers held accountable by covenant, Scripture, and higher courts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Scripture (epistolary pastoral corpus), Westminster standards and classical Reformed authors (Calvin, Knox), and 19th-century Presbyterian practice.
 - Implicit antagonists: Congregationalists (independent churches), Episcopalians (high-church hierarchy), Revivalists and lax disciplinarians, and Erastian tendencies that subordinate church to civil magistrate.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (visible church, offices), covenantal polity, authority and jurisdiction, ordination, sacraments in relation to office, discipline and church purity, accountability and church courts.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Church office is a divine, covenantal instrument for the maintenance of truth and holiness: ordered authority exercised under Scripture and collective accountability is essential to the life of the visible church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong stress on the corporate and juridical character of ordained authority (plural eldership, courts) rather than merely charismatic or congregational notions of leadership.
 - Balances robust ruling power with pastoral servanthood-authority as corrective, custodial, and formative for holiness and doctrine.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived laxity in revivalist or liberal approaches that minimize discipline and ordered governance.
 - Contrasts with Episcopalian hierarchical models by defending parity and accountability among elders and with Congregationalist autonomy by insisting on inter-church courts and connectional order.
 - Opposes Erastian subordination of church governance to civil power; insists on spiritual sovereignty of ecclesiastical courts within their own sphere.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precision in defining *jurisdiction* and *office* as both spiritual and juridical categories-office as a covenantal trust, not merely a functional role.
 - Articulates discipline as remedial and sanctifying rather than merely punitive or social.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read and cited in conservative Southern Presbyterian circles; influential in 19th and early 20th century debates on discipline and confessional fidelity.
 - Continues to be used in Reformed and Presbyterian debates as a classical statement defending church courts and ordered ministry.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating biblical exegesis, confessional standards, and pastoral pragmatics on church government.
 - Useful for teaching Presbyterial polity, restoring discipline, and resisting both ecclesiastical laxity and authoritarianism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ecclesiastical rulers** - office-bearers (elders/ministers) who exercise spiritual authority for the church's preservation and discipline.
- **Elder / Presbyter** - plural, corporate rulers who share pastoral and judicial responsibilities; parity stressed.
- **Minister of the Word** - teaching office distinguished by proclamation and sacramental administration; subject to courts.
- **Ordination** - public recognition and sealing of a divine call; confers jurisdictional authority within covenant bounds.
- **Jurisdiction** - the lawful scope and limits of office-bearing authority; includes sessional and higher court oversight.
- **Church courts (session, presbytery, assembly)** - ordered tribunals for governance, doctrinal adjudication, and discipline.
- **Discipline** - remedial, covenantal process for restoration and purity; theological and practical sine qua non of church life.
- **Visible church** - covenant community governed visibly by instituted offices and sacraments; distinguished from invisible church.
- **Covenantal order** - framework tying office, authority, and discipline to communal covenant obligations.
- **Confessionalism** - adherence to standards (Westminster) as normative for office and court decisions.
- **Erastianism** - rival stance subordinating church to state; opposed by Dabney's defense of ecclesiastical autonomy.
- **Parity vs. hierarchy** - tension resolved toward parity of elders with ordered courts, not episcopal supremacy.
- **Keys of the kingdom** - authority to bind and loose exercised by rulers within covenantal jurisdiction.
- **Pastoral servanthood** - the ethical check on authority; rulers act in service, not domination.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Presbyterian office theology and the nature of eldership.
 - As a **polemic** against congregationalist, episcopal, revivalist, and Erastian tendencies.
 - As a **practical model** for church discipline and court procedure in confessional Reformed bodies.
