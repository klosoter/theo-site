### TITLE
Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Prolegomena to Theology - Richard A. Muller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century retrieval of 16th-17th c. Reformed orthodoxy, correcting neo-orthodox and liberal caricatures.
 - Maps the scholastic and humanist milieu of early modern Protestantism and its Catholic interlocutors.
- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed orthodoxy forged a coherent, catholic, exegetically driven and scholastically precise **prolegomena** in continuity with the Reformers, centering on **principia** and the distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal** theology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines the **nature and task of theology** as both **scientia** and **sapientia**, a **habitus** ordered to piety.
 - Articulates **principia**:
 - **Principium essendi**: God himself.
 - **Principium cognoscendi externum**: Holy Scripture; **internum**: the Holy Spirit.
 - Clarifies **theology as a science**: methodus, loci, disputatio, and hermeneutics (sensus literalis, analogia fidei).
 - Distinguishes **archetypal/ectypal**; **theologia viatorum/beatorum**; regulates theological speech via analogy and accommodation.
 - Treats reason, **natural theology** (via causalitatis, negationis, eminentiae), and its limits for salvation.
 - Situates key controversies that shape method: **middle knowledge (Molinism)**, **providence and evil**, **sin and free will**, **absolute and relative attributes**, and the presupposed grammar of **eternal generation and spiration**.
 - Relates analytical frameworks: **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** as distinct yet coordinated.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed: Calvin, Beza, Junius, Polanus, Perkins, Ames, Wollebius, Voetius, Owen, Turretin, Mastricht.
 - Medieval and Renaissance: Aquinas, Bonaventure, Scotus; humanist rhetoric.
 - Interlocutors: Roman Catholic scholastics (Suarez, Molina), Socinians, Remonstrants.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology**: inspiration, authority, clarity, sufficiency, canon, autopistia, Spirit's testimony.
 - **Theology Proper**: attributes (absolute/relative; incommunicable/communicable), simplicity and aseity presupposed; **Trinitarian processions** as grounds of personal properties and missions.
 - **Providence/foreknowledge/evil**, **freedom/compatibilism**, and methodological implications for exegesis and system.
 - **Soteriology**: relation of **historia** and **ordo**, avoiding conflation.
- **Center of gravity**
 - A principial, God-centered, Scripture-normed, Spirit-enabled **theological science** calibrated by scholastic distinctions in service of the church's reading of Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Restores **continuity** between Reformers and orthodox scholastics; theology as **habitus** ordered to piety.
 - Systematic use of **archetypal/ectypal** and **principia** to discipline discourse about God.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters the myth of a rationalist, declension narrative in Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Rejects **Molinist scientia media** while retaining a robust account of **divine concurrence** and secondary causes.
 - Clarifies compatibilist **freedom** (liberty from coaction, not from necessity) over libertarian schemes.
- **Conceptual innovations (retrieved and clarified)**
 - Fine-grained distinctions: **natural vs free knowledge of God**, **absolute vs relative attributes**, **viatorum vs beatorum**, **historia vs ordo salutis**.
 - Hermeneutical rules: **sensus literalis**, **analogia fidei**, and **accommodation**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became the standard Anglophone map of Reformed scholastic prolegomena; shaped contemporary discourse on classical theism, Scripture, and method across confessional lines.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides conceptual scaffolding for teaching prolegomena; supplies precise terminology for debates on **Trinity**, **providence**, **freedom**, **Scripture**, and **method**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Archetypal / Ectypal Theology**: God's self-knowledge vs. accommodated creaturely theology; guards Creator-creature distinction.
- **Principia of Theology**:
 - **Essendi**: God as the ontic ground.
 - **Cognoscendi externum**: Scripture; **internum**: Spirit's testimony (autopistia).
- **Theology as Habitus and Scientia**: A graced habit disposing to wisdom; organized by methodus and loci.
- **Theologia viatorum / beatorum**: Pilgrim vs beatified knowing; tempers claims to comprehensiveness.
- **Natural Theology**: True yet non-salvific knowledge by effects and negations; ordered under Scripture.
- **Absolute / Relative Attributes**: God in se vs ad extra relations; maintains simplicity while enabling predication.
- **Eternal Generation and Spiration**: Processions grounding Son's and Spirit's personal properties; regulate missions and language.
- **Divine Knowledge**: **Natural** (all possibles) and **free** (decreed actuals); excludes **scientia media**.
- **Providence, Foreknowledge, Evil**: Concursus with secondary causes; God not author of sin; evil as privation with moral culpability located in the will.
- **Sin and Free Will**: Postlapsarian inability with responsibility; liberty from coercion, not from infallible inclination.
- **Historia salutis / Ordo salutis**: Redemptive-historical accomplishment vs application; complementary analytic lenses.
- **Scripture's Authority and Clarity**: Inspiration, sufficiency, perspicuity; governed reading by the **analogy of faith**.
- **Accommodation and Anthropomorphism**: God's self-condescension in Scripture's mode of speech.
- **Scholastic Method**: Disputation, syllogistic clarity, and loci organization serving exegesis.
- **How this work is used**
 - **Definition source** for principia, archetypal/ectypal, freedom, providence, attributes.
 - **Polemical map** against Molinism, Socinianism, and declension narratives.
 - **Hermeneutical and methodological template** for reading Scripture and structuring loci.
 - **Conceptual pivot** tying Theology Proper to Bibliology, Trinity, Soteriology, and Sin.
