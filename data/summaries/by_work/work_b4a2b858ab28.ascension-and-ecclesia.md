### TITLE
Ascension and Ecclesia: On the Church as Communion in the Risen Christ - Douglas Farrow

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th/early 21st-century Reformed and ecumenical theological conversation focused on recovery of classical catholic doctrine against modern individualism and secularizing ecclesiologies.
 - Responds to trends in Protestant theology that emphasize incarnation and resurrection while marginalizing the ascension and its ecclesial implications.
- **Central thesis**
 - The **ascension and exaltation of Christ** are constitutive for the being of the church: the ecclesia is fundamentally a communion formed and sustained by participation in the risen, ascended Christ rather than by sociological, political, or purely institutional criteria.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural and patristic exegesis demonstrating how New Testament (especially Luke-Acts, Paul, Johannine material) and patristic writers conceive of Christ's ascension as the basis for his present rule and presence.
 - Theological synthesis linking **Christology (ascension/exaltation)** and **ecclesiology (communion, sacramental participation)** via the Spirit: the Spirit mediates the ascended Christ's presence to the church.
 - Polemic against modern reductions: critiques ecclesial individualism, voluntaristic notions of church, and political/social redefinitions divorced from Christ's ascension.
 - Practical sacramental and ministerial consequences: Eucharist and baptism as participation in ascended Christ, ministry as ordering of communion rather than managerial governance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: New Testament authors; selected patristic fathers (e.g., Gregory, Augustine) and medieval precedents.
 - Modern interlocutors: critical engagement with Protestant modernists and some contemporary systematic theologians who underplay ascension themes (implicit contrasts with theologians such as Bultmannian streams, some readings of Barth/Pannenberg where relevant).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (ascension, exaltation, present rule)
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit as mediator of Christ's presence)
 - **Ecclesiology** (church as communion, sacramental life)
 - **Sacramentology** (Eucharist, baptism as means of participation)
 - **Eschatology** (already/not-yet; parousia in relation to ascension)
 - Secondary: revelation, ministry, covenantal life
- **Closing line**
 - The church is ontologically what it is only as the communion of those who share in the presence and rule of the ascended Christ through Spirit-wrought sacramental and ministerial life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the **ascension** (not merely the resurrection) as the decisive event that grounds ecclesial identity and presence.
 - Treats ecclesiology primarily as *communion in the ascended Lord* rather than as organization, program, or social movement.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern Protestant tendencies to reduce church to ethical community, mission agency, or sociopolitical actor; opposes privatized pietism that disconnects sacraments from Christ's exalted presence.
 - Challenges purely immanent eschatologies that collapse future parousia into present social progress.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frequent formulation: **"communion in the risen and ascended Christ"** as a technical shorthand to unite Christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology.
 - Moves the language of presence/absence from philosophical abstraction into sacramental and theological categories rooted in ascension theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and Anglican scholarly circles for recovering a neglected doctrinal nexus; cited in studies on sacrament, ministry, and public theology.
 - Less influential in streams that prioritize ecclesial ethics or socio-political ecclesiologies; but increasingly referenced in ecumenical conversations seeking common ground on presence and sacrament.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a corrective reorientation: an accessible yet rigorous model for teaching ecclesiology that integrates Scripture, patristics, and Reformed theological commitments.
 - Stimulates renewed attention to ascension theology as formative for pastoral practice and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ascension** - The bodily exaltation of Christ to God's right hand; treated as constitutive for his rule and presence in the church.
- **Exaltation** - Theological nuance of ascension emphasizing reigning, priestly and kingly office exercised over the church.
- **Communion** - The church's ontological mode: participation in the life of the ascended Christ; social and sacramental fellowship rooted in Christ's presence.
- **Ecclesia** - Not merely institution or assembly, but the gathered, sacramental body constituted by union with the ascended Lord.
- **Presence** - How Christ is "present" now: mediated by Spirit and sacrament rather than by physical indwelling; a presence rooted in ascension/exaltation.
- **Pneumatology** - The Spirit's role in making the ascended Christ present to the church and enabling communion.
- **Sacrament/Eucharist/Baptism** - Means by which participation in the ascended Christ is effected; Eucharist as encounter with the ascended Lord.
- **Eschatology (already/not yet)** - Ascension as the hinge between resurrection victory already realized and future consummation (parousia).
- **Ministry/Order** - Ministry conceived as ordering of communion under the rule of the ascended Christ, not as bureaucratic function.
- **Covenantal language** - Use of covenant to ground ecclesial continuity and identity under the ascended Lord.
- **Presence/Absence dialectic** - Analytical frame discussing Christ's bodily absence and mediated presence in the church.
- **Communion in the risen Christ** - Technical phrase summarizing the book's thesis; shorthand for ecclesial ontological claim.
- **Patristic retrieval** - The strategy of recovering early church resources to illumine contemporary ecclesiology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for connecting ascension doctrine to ecclesial identity in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against sociological and voluntaristic ecclesiologies in contemporary church debates.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Luke-Acts, Pauline texts, and patristic ascension motifs with ecclesiological consequences.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology to reframe Eucharist and baptism as participation in the ascended Christ.
