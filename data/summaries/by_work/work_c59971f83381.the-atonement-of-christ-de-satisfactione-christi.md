### TITLE
Francis Turretin, De Satisfactione Christi (The Atonement of Christ) - Reformed scholastic defense of penal satisfaction and particular redemption.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 17th century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687), professor at the Academy of Geneva, writing against post-Reformation controversies: Arminianism, Socinianism, and Grotius-style denials of penal satisfaction.
 - Milieu: consolidation of high Calvinist doctrine in Geneva and the Swiss academies; method: scholastic quaestiones and loci communes style, dialectical engagement with patristic, medieval, and contemporary sources.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christ's atonement is a real, penal satisfaction of divine justice, efficacious and particular in intent and effect for the elect; satisfaction is both necessary and sufficient for salvation within God's covenantal and forensic economy.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and necessity: shows why satisfaction (penal sanction borne by Christ) is required given sin, divine justice, and the honor of God's law.
 - Nature of satisfaction: distinguishes satisfaction, expiation, propitiation, and reconciliation; locates satisfaction in Christ's passive obedience (death) and links active obedience to merit of life.
 - Extent and intention: argues for definite atonement-Christ's satisfaction was intended for and efficaciously applied to the elect.
 - Modes and imputation: defends legal imputation of sin to Christ and righteousness to believers; clarifies federal/covenantal context.
 - Polemic: rejects Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism, Grotius' governmental theory, Socinian moral influence accounts, and offers exegetical rebuttals to Arminian universalist readings.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic and medieval: Augustine (positive exemplar), Anselm (satisfaction heritage), Aquinas (analogies).
 - Contemporaries and rivals: Hugo Grotius, Arminians (Jacobus Arminius' heirs), Socinians, Semi-Pelagians and Pelagians (historical errors addressed).
 - Scripture: sustained exegesis of key forensic texts (e.g., Romans, Isaiah, Hebrews, 1 Peter, 1 John).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology:** dual obedience (active and passive) as ground of satisfaction.
 - **Soteriology/atonement:** penal satisfaction, substitution, imputation, extent (particularity), necessity and sufficiency.
 - **Covenant theology and forensic categories:** covenant of redemption, federal headship, legal transfer of guilt and righteousness.
 - **Related:** divine justice, grace vs. free will debates (Pelagianism Semi Pelagianism And Augustinianism), sacrificial typology and priesthood.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's De Satisfactione Christi centers Reformed theology on a juridical, particular, and efficacious penal satisfaction: Christ bore the penal wrath of God for the elect, securing their justification by imputed righteousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous scholastic precision in parsing types of atonement language (satisfaction vs. propitiation vs. expiation) and in mapping active/passive obedience to justification and sanctification.
 - Strong insistence that satisfaction is objectively accomplished and intentionally limited to the elect while remaining sufficient for all.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Reworks Anselmian satisfaction into a penal-forensic model rather than purely honor-restoration; directly opposes Grotius' governmental theory and Socinian denials of substitution.
 - Reinforces Augustinian anthropology against Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian appeals to unaided human will.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight distinction between the sufficiency and the efficacy of the atonement-sufficient for all, efficacious only for the elect (Turretin's careful balance preserves God's power and intentionality).
 - Systematic linking of federal/forensic imputation with covenantal intention, clarifying how Christ's merit is applied.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Reformed orthodoxy: influential in Geneva, Dutch Reformed circles, English and American Presbyterianism (Princeton), and later conservative Reformed scholarship.
 - Continues to be a prime resource in contemporary debates over limited atonement and penal substitution.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined theological method: precise distinctions, scriptural engagement, and polemical clarity make it valuable for teaching on atonement, covenant theology, and historical doctrinal apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Satisfaction** - Christ's rendering of what divine justice demands; here, penal rather than merely honor-restorative.
- **Penal substitution** - Christ suffered the penalty deserved by sinners; Turretin's core explanatory category.
- **Propitiation** - Removal of divine wrath by Christ's sacrifice; distinguished from mere moral influence.
- **Expiation** - The removal/cleansing of sin; paired with propitiation but analyzed separately.
- **Imputation** - Legal transfer: sin to Christ, Christ's righteousness to believers; central forensic mechanism.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's life obedience (merit for positive righteousness) and death/suffering (satisfaction of penalty).
- **Particular redemption / limited atonement** - Christ's death was intended and efficacious for the elect specifically; defended against universalist readings.
- **Sufficiency vs. efficacy** - Satisfaction sufficient in value for all; efficacious in application only to the elect.
- **Federal headship / covenant of redemption** - Covenantal framework explaining legal standing and transfer of merits.
- **Divine justice (forensic honor)** - Ground for requiring satisfaction; not merely expressive but juridical.
- **Substitution** - Christ as legal substitute bearing penalty; distinguished from example theories.
- **Moral influence & governmental theories** - Contemporary alternatives Turretin critiques systematically.
- **Original sin / depravity** - Anthropological presupposition that necessitates divine, not merely human, remedy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and methodological source for the Reformed formulation of **penal substitution** and **limited atonement**.
 - As a polemic template against **Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism**, Socinianism, and **governmental/moral influence theories**.
 - As an exegetical and conceptual model for teaching forensic soteriology, imputation, and covenantal justification.
