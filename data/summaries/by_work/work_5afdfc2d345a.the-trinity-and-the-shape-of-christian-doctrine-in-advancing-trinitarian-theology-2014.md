### TITLE
The Trinity and the Shape of Christian Doctrine - Fred Sanders (chapter in Advancing Trinitarian Theology, 2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary constructive Trinitarian renewal (early 21st century), within evangelical and Reformed circles seeking to recover Trinitarian grammar for systematic theology.
 - Conversation set against resurgence of social-relational Trinitarian emphases and reactive debates over Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) among conservative evangelicals.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is not an isolated locus but the formative matrix that gives shape to Christian doctrine; failing to think theologically Trinitarianly distorts other loci (Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, worship).
 - Implicit polemic: doctrinal moves that appeal to intra‑Trinitarian ordering (e.g., EFS claims) must be assessed by classical Trinitarian concerns (relations of origin, perichoresis, unity of will/essence).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes the Trinity as a theological *formative principle*: Trinitarian grammar organizes theological categories rather than merely adding an extra doctrine.
 - Traces how canonical and creedal materials articulate pattern of relations (Father begets, Son is begotten, Spirit proceeds) and how these patterns constrain theological claims about subordination, authority, and personhood.
 - Argues for recovery of classical distinctions (immanent vs economic Trinity; person vs nature; relations as relational properties), insisting that economic relations disclose but do not fracture divine unity.
 - Applies Trinitarian criteria to contemporary debates, particularly rejecting simplistic readings that read economic ordering as eternal subordination of status or authority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine (implicitly as part of the classical tradition).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of EFS (notably some recent evangelical theologians), social-Trinitarian proponents, and Reformed constructive theologians.
 - Scripture and creedal texts are used as primary bases for claims about relations and economy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, revelation/worship (as loci shaped by Trinitarian grammar).
 - Methodology of theology: doctrine-formation, analogy, and doctrine interdependence.
- **Closing line**
 - The Trinity is the doctrinal skeleton: thinking rightly about God's inner life reconfigures and disciplines every other Christian doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats the Trinity as an organizing principle or "shape" rather than a discrete doctrinal box; doctrine as shaped by intra‑divine relations rather than merely informed by them.
 - Insists on a hermeneutic of doxology and worship: Trinitarian doctrine is first lived in praise, then expressed in doctrine.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that make intra‑Trinitarian economic ordering justify persistent ontological subordination (EFS). Distinguishes functional language in the economy from metaphysical inequality.
 - Offers corrective to some social‑Trinitarian rhetoric that can inadvertently sever classical emphases on relations of origin and ontological unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of metaphors like "shape" or "grammar" of doctrine to capture formative force of Trinitarian insight.
 - Reframing "function" language so that roles in the economy do not imply ontological asymmetry.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by many constructive theologians as a methodological clarifier: Trinitarian retrieval as organizing axis.
 - Served as a principled resource for critics of EFS within evangelical scholarship, emphasizing classical safeguards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes systematic theologians to reorder loci according to Trinitarian priority and to apply classical distinctions in contemporary debates; valuable for classroom use on method and for corrective polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian grammar / shape** - The idea that the Trinity provides formative categories that structure all doctrine.
- **Economic Trinity** - The way God's actions in history disclose the inner life; used to judge but not to replace the immanent Trinity.
- **Immanent Trinity** - The inner, eternal relations of the Godhead; emphasized to prevent conflation with contingent economic roles.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** - Relational language that secures unity without absorption; grounds communion and personhood.
- **Relations of origin** - Father as source, Son as begotten, Spirit as procession; used to defend classical ordering against egalitarian misreadings.
- **Functional language (roles vs. being)** - Distinction that roles in salvation economy do not entail ontological subordination among persons.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - Contemporary proposal holding eternal authority/submission within the Godhead; Sanders' treatment is critical and cautionary.
 - Emphasizes that economic precedence cannot straightforwardly be read into eternal intra‑divine authority structures.
- **Doxology as method** - Worship-priority heuristic: doctrine grows out of praise and the liturgical life; shapes theological priorities.
- **Analogy and distinction (person/nature)** - Classical doctrinal tools to mediate how persons relate without dividing the divine essence.
- **Theological formation / loci reorder** - Practical move to reorder systematic loci to reflect Trinitarian primacy.
- **Unity of will/essence** - Affirmation that Trinitarian persons share one will and one divine essence; used to rebut claims of divergent wills implied by EFS.
- **Scriptural anchoring** - Uses Scripture to read economic actions as revelatory not constitutive of ontological disparity.
- **Reception use - polemic** - Cited by critics of EFS as a conceptual safeguard against ontologizing economic roles.
- **Reception use - exegetical model** - Employed as an interpretive template: read biblical actions of Father, Son, Spirit in light of classical Trinitarian distinctions.
- **Reception use - conceptual pivot** - Serves as a pivot for constructive systematic projects that start with the Trinity rather than add it as a final chapter.
