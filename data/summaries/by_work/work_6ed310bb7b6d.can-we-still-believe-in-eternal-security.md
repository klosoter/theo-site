### TITLE
Can We Still Believe in Eternal Security? - Craig L. Blomberg

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical debate: renewed public discussion over "once saved always saved" (Free Grace) vs. classical Reformed perseverance vs. Arminian conditional security.
 - Blomberg writes as a conservative New Testament scholar within evangelical academia, addressing popular and scholarly audiences concerned about pastoral implications and biblical exegesis.

- **Central thesis**
 - The traditional maxim of absolute, unconditional eternal security ("once saved, always saved") cannot be sustained exegetically across the New Testament; a qualified, conditional security better fits the corpus and pastoral witness of Scripture.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of New Testament texts that bear on final salvation and apostasy (notably Hebrews warning passages, John 10, Galatians, 1 Corinthians, James, Revelation).
 - Lexical and contextual analysis: uses of "save," "perish," "fall away," "abide," and warning imperatives are argued to carry soteriological force, not merely ethical exhortation.
 - Theological synthesis: salvation is portrayed as an ongoing covenantal relationship requiring sustained faith and repentance; perseverance is both a gift of grace and a human responsibility.
 - Pastoral conclusion: assurance is possible and desirable, but must be balanced with exhortation, discipline, and sober warnings to prevent antinomian complacency.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with Free Grace proponents (popularized "once saved" formulations), classical Reformed defenders of perseverance (Perseverance of the Saints), and Arminian conditionalists.
 - Primary interlocutors are New Testament texts; secondary conversation with contemporary evangelical theologians and systematicians who argue for unconditional assurance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (salvation, justification, sanctification, perseverance)
 - Ecclesiology (discipline, membership, covenant community)
 - Hermeneutics (warning texts, apostolic exhortation)
 - Pastoral theology (assurance, pastoral warnings, preaching)

- **Closing line**
 - Blomberg locates the theological center of gravity on a conditional-but-grace-grounded perseverance: salvation is secured in Christ but requires sustained, persevering faith authenticated by transformed life and responsive obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous New Testament exegesis as the primary arbiter rather than systematic priors; warning texts are treated as central, not peripheral.
 - Balances Divine sovereignty in perseverance with clear moral and covenantal responsibility on believers; restraint of determinism while rejecting antinomian assurance.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects simplistic Free Grace readings that minimize apostolic warnings as mere "parenthetical" or "hypothetical" rhetoric.
 - Contrasts with some Reformed formulations by insisting that perseverance language indicates conditional human response, not merely evidence of election.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Stresses a functional distinction between initial justification (positional) and ongoing final salvation (eschatological and participatory), insisting that many NT verbs and imperatives pertain to the latter.
 - Emphasizes the covenantal texture of NT soteriology: salvation as a sustained relationship rather than a one-time legal transaction only.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical circles for precise NT argumentation; used by pastors and teachers who wish to critique antinomian applications of assurance while maintaining robust confidence in Christ.
 - Provoked pushback from staunch Free Grace advocates and some strict Calvinists; influential in dialogues seeking a middle evangelical path.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful exegetical engagement with pastoral theology.
 - Serves as a resource for preaching and counseling that wants to hold assurance and accountability together.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal security / "once saved, always saved"**
 - The doctrine that initial faith irrevocably secures final salvation irrespective of future apostasy; Blomberg argues this is an overreach of some Pauline data.
- **Conditional security**
 - Salvation whose final realization depends on sustained faith, repentance, and perseverance; Blomberg's preferred framing.
- **Perseverance of the saints**
 - Classical Reformed doctrine; Blomberg affirms perseverance as a necessary marker but contests formulations that eliminate the force of warnings.
- **Assurance**
 - Confidence in salvation; for Blomberg, genuine but tempered by pastoral warnings and eschatological uncertainty for those who abandon faith.
- **Apostasy / "fall away" (parapipto, apostasia)**
 - Key NT terms indicating real, penal/relational loss; treated as genuine possibilities in several warning passages.
- **Warning passages (Hebrews 2, 3-4, 6, 10; Galatians 5; 1 Corinthians 9; Revelation letters)**
 - Central exegetical loci showing the authors' concern that persevering faith is required for final salvation.
- **Covenant relationship**
 - Frame for understanding salvation as ongoing participation in the new covenant community rather than a one-time transaction.
- **Faith and works (or faith evidenced by works)**
 - Blomberg stresses that ongoing faith is evidenced by obedience; works are not meritorious but indicative.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive transformation enabling perseverance; both divine gift and human response.
- **Pastoral balance**
 - The pastoral application of guarding assurance without fostering complacency; preaching must include warnings and means of grace.
- **Free Grace vs. Lordship / covenantal readings**
 - Contrasts these approaches; Blomberg rejects extreme Free Grace and augments Lordship emphases with covenantal continuity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT warning texts as soteriologically significant.
- As a **polemic** against antinomian Free Grace formulations and against overly deterministic readings of perseverance.
- As a **teaching resource** for pastoral theology classes on assurance, apostasy, and discipleship.
