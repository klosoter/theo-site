### TITLE
Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st century Reformed-evangelical conversation about science and faith; written for an audience of pastors, scientists, and theologians concerned with integration.
 - Reaction against the perceived dominance of scientism and against simplistic "two-books" bifurcations; conversant with philosophy of science (Kuhn, Popper), contemporary Christian philosophers (e.g., Alvin Plantinga), and evangelical scientists/theologians (e.g., John Polkinghorne, Francis Schaeffer).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Science must be *redeemed* - re-grounded in a theocentric theology - so that scientific practice, concepts, and aims are shaped by the biblical doctrine of God (creation, providence, revelation), rather than by metaphysical naturalism or autonomous scientism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern science often presupposes methodological naturalism and covert metaphysical commitments that exclude God.
 - Theological proposal: reframe science on a **God-centered epistemology** where general revelation (the world) and special revelation (Scripture) coherently inform scientific activity.
 - Practical implications: reinterpreting laws of nature, explanation, models, and the role of mathematics in a framework that credits God as Creator-Lawgiver and sustainer.
 - Methodological moves:
 - Apply Reformed categories (sovereignty, providence, common grace) to justify scientific inquiry and its reliability.
 - Use theological epistemology to critique scientism and to legitimize Christian scientific practice without denying empirical rigor.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with philosophy of science (Popper, Kuhn), critiques naturalistic philosophers and scientistic public intellectuals; dialogues with Christian apologists and scientists (Plantinga, Polkinghorne, Barbour-type typologies).
 - Draws extensively on Scripture, Reformed systematic theology, and historical figures in the Christian intellectual tradition.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence (God as sustainer and lawgiver)
 - Revelation (special and general), authority of Scripture in interpreting nature
 - Common grace and the legitimacy of secular science
 - Epistemology: knowledge, truth, models, and metaphysics underlying scientific practice
 - Implicitly touches on Trinity (as grounding of knowledge and relationality), Christology (Lordship over creation), and covenantal themes (human vocation to steward creation)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Science is a legitimate, necessary human practice only when rooted in a theocentric vision: the Creator's Word governs both the cosmos and our knowing, so true science honors God as the ultimate intelligibility and lawgiver.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that God is the normative ground for the intelligibility, order, and laws of nature; scientific laws are expressions of divine ordinance rather than autonomous regularities.
 - Integrates theology and philosophy of science by applying Reformed categories (sovereignty, common grace) to methodological questions.
 - Emphasizes the communicative character of creation: nature as a site of revelation mediated by human cultural practices.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects the naive "two-books" model by insisting Scripture governs interpretation of the book of nature rather than remaining parallel and independent.
 - Opposes both scientism (which idolizes scientific method as ultimate arbiter) and fideism (which denigrates reason or empirical inquiry).
 - More constructive than mere apologetic rebuttals: offers positive theological resources to shape scientific practice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of Poythress's broader commitments (e.g., triperspectival awareness) to science: normative (what ought to guide science), situational (contextual scientific facts), existential (practitioners' commitments).
 - Recasting "laws of nature" theologically as God-ordained regularities amenable to mathematical description because of God's rationality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in Reformed evangelical academic and church settings for providing a systematic framework for science-faith integration.
 - Used in curricula at conservative theological seminaries and by Christian scientists seeking a coherent worldview foundation.
 - Criticized by some philosophers and scientists for being programmatic or for underplaying methodological constraints of empirical science.
- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a sustained, theologically coherent alternative to naturalistic philosophies of science; valuable for students, pastors, and scholars seeking a biblically faithful philosophy of science.
 - Acts as a bridge between technical philosophy of science and practical theological formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redeeming Science**
 - The project of reorienting scientific practice under the lordship of Christ and theological categories.
- **God-centered approach**
 - Epistemological posture that places God as the ultimate ground of intelligibility and normativity for science.
- **General revelation**
 - Creation as witness to God; used to justify the knowability of nature but interpreted under Scripture.
- **Special revelation**
 - Scripture as the corrective and interpretive key for the book of nature.
- **Common grace**
 - The theological basis for the productivity and reliability of non-Christian scientists and secular discoveries.
- **Laws of nature**
 - Theologically construed as divine ordinances or regularities instituted by God, not brute metaphysical forces apart from God.
- **Scientism**
 - The rival worldview that Poythress critiques: science elevated to exclusive arbiter of truth and meaning.
- **Methodological naturalism**
 - A pragmatic scientific constraint; Poythress distinguishes its methodological utility from metaphysical commitment.
- **Triperspectival application**
 - Normative, situational, existential lenses applied to scientific questions (Poythress's broader methodological habitus).
- **Models and metaphors**
 - Science relies on models; Poythress emphasizes their provisional, analogical character within a theological frame.
- **Mathematical structure of nature**
 - The idea that the efficacy of mathematics reflects God's rational ordering of creation.
- **Worldview / presuppositions**
 - Science as embedded in worldview commitments; Poythress argues for explicit Christian presuppositions.
- **Covenantal practice**
 - Scientific work as a vocation under covenantal stewardship of creation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: supplies terminology and a coherent outline for a Christian philosophy of science in introductory courses.
 - Polemic: used against scientism and naturalistic epistemologies in apologetics and public theology.
 - Conceptual pivot: models curriculum and research agendas that integrate Reformed theology with empirical disciplines.
