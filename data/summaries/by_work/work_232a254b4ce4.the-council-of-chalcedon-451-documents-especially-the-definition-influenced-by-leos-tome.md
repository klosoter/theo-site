### TITLE
The Council of Chalcedon (451) - Definition (influenced by Leo the Great's Tome)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Convened 451 CE under imperial auspices; response to Christological controversies after Ephesus (431) and the Eutychian/Monophysite reactions. Leo I (the Great) submitted the Tome (449/450), which became decisive for Chalcedon's Definition.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to confess the person and natures of Christ so as to avoid Nestorian division of the person and Monophysite fusion of the natures.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation: **one and the same Christ, Son, Lord, only-begotten**.
 - Ontological formula: **in two natures** (duae naturae) without confusion, without change, without division, without separation.
 - Personal formula: **one person (hypostasis/ prosopon)** of the Word incarnate, the attributes of each nature truly belong to the single person.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial move: condemnations of extremes (Nestorius, Eutyches) and reception of Leo's Tome as authoritative theological exposition.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Leo the Great (Tome), Cyril of Alexandria (Christological language), Nestorian writings, Eutychian/Patripassian tendencies; delegates from Eastern and Western sees; later interlocutors include Oriental Orthodox (rejection) and Eastern Orthodox/Catholic recep
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and natures, hypostatic union), Trinity implicitly (who the Word is), incarnation, soteriology (implications of united person for atonement), ecclesial authority and conciliar definition.
- **Closing line:** Chalcedon - shaped by Leo's Tome - anchors orthodox Christology in a **one-person, two-natures** formula that preserves full divinity and full humanity while insisting on their inseparable union in the one incarnate Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The famous quartet: **"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"** - a restraint against both fusion and separation.
 - Priority of **person (hypostasis/prosopon)** over a blunt enumeration of characteristics: two natures are united in one person.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Nestorian tendencies by insisting on one subject (the Word) who acts and suffers.
 - Counters Monophysitism/Eutychianism by rejecting any ontological absorption of the human into the divine nature.
 - Synthesizes Cyril's emphasis on unity and Leo's insistence on real human nature.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operational clarity about attribution: properties of each nature can be truly ascribed to the one person without metaphysical confusion - proto-formulation of **communicatio idiomatum** and communicatio operationum.
 - Use of legal-conciliar language to stabilize theological taxonomy (physeis/hypostasis/prosopon).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely received in Eastern Orthodox and Catholic traditions as normative. Oriental Orthodox rejected it, producing a lasting schism.
 - Reformed and Protestant traditions broadly accept Chalcedon as the classical standard; nonetheless, different traditions (Lutheran, Reformed) emphasize communicatio idiomatum variably for soteriology and worship.
 - Influential as a hermeneutical and confessional touchstone for later Christological debates (patristic retrieval, scholasticism, Reformation Christology).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, testable schema for orthodox Christology.
 - Serves as a discipline-building exemplar: balancing metaphysical precision, biblical exegesis, and pastoral concern.
 - Continues to shape ecumenical conversations about terminology and reconciliation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tome of Leo (Leo I):** A theological letter articulating the personal and natural distinction in Christ; heavily quoted and authoritative at Chalcedon.
- **Chalcedon Definition (451):** Concise conciliar formula affirming one person in two natures, with the quartet formula.
- **Hypostasis / Prosopon:** Terms designating the personal subject; Chalcedon asserts one hypostasis/person of the Word incarnate.
- **Physis (nature) / Dya physis:** Two real, distinct natures - divine and human - in the one person.
- **Dyophysitism:** The theological position (Chalcedonian) affirming two natures after the union.
- **Miaphysitism / Monophysitism:** Competing positions (Emphasized by Oriental Orthodox) that Chalcedon rejected as conflating or absorbing natures.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** The theological principle that properties of each nature are ascribed to the single person; Chalcedon provides the functional basis for this attribution.
 - Related: **Communicatio Operationum** - the operations of the one person derive from both natures, enabling claims like "the Word suffered" (with careful qualification).
- **"Without confusion, without change, without division, without separation":** Technical safeguard against doctrinal extremes; used as hermeneutic constraint.
- **One person, two natures (summary phrase):** The central formula used across confessions to locate Chalcedon's teaching.
- **Implicate soteriological uses:** Basis for understanding atonement, mediation, and sanctification - Christ truly acts and suffers as both God and man.
- **Conciliar authority:** Model for theological definition in ecumenical councils; precedent for later doctrinal formulations.
- **Ecumenical pivot:** Starting point in dialogues between Chalcedonian and non-Chalcedonian churches seeking terminological convergence.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source:** Primary classical formulation for orthodox Christology in systematic theologies and confessions.
- **Polemic resource:** Deployed against Nestorian and Monophysite positions, and later in Protestant and Catholic controversies.
- **Exegetical model:** Template for attributing biblical predicates (e.g., death, resurrection) to the incarnate Word via communicatio idiomatum.
- **Conceptual pivot:** Serves as a hinge for ecumenical negotiation, theological education, and doctrinal coherence between Christology and soteriology.
