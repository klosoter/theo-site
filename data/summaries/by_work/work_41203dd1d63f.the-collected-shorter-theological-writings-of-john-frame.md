### TITLE
The Collected Shorter Theological Writings of John M. Frame - essay cluster on **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed evangelical milieu; Frame writes as a conservative Presbyterian theologian and seminary teacher. The pieces gather shorter essays, lectures, and reviews that interact with both classical patristic formulations and contemporary evangelical debates.
 - Methodologically shaped by Frame's broader commitments: Reformed confessionalism, commitment to Scripture as revelation, and his "multiperspectival" approach to theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Affirm and defend the classical doctrine of **eternal Sonship (eternal generation)** against modern reductions that make the Sonship merely economic or temporal, while showing how the eternal Son becomes incarnate without compromising divine immutability or Chalcedonian Christology.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful readings of Johannine and Pauline texts (e.g., John 1; Hebrews; Philippians) that traditionally support eternal generation and the eternality of the Son.
 - Historical-theological move: appeal to patristic and medieval formulations (Athanasius, Augustine, Cappadocians, Chalcedon) to show continuity with orthodox tradition.
 - Doctrinal clarification:
 - Distinguish **immanent Trinity** (relations of origin within God) from **economic Trinity** (God's actions in history) and insist on the reality of both.
 - Distinguish **eternal generation** (ontological relation) from any notion of temporal begetting or inferiority.
 - Christological application: locate the Incarnation as a historical action of the eternal Son - maintain full deity and full humanity via the hypostatic union, without collapsing personal distinctions or creating two sons.
 - Polemical moves: respond to contemporary critics who deny eternal generation or who interpret Sonship as only functional/subordinate in time.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic and medieval authorities (e.g., Athanasius, Augustine, Cappadocians), Chalcedonian tradition.
 - Contemporary evangelical interlocutors who question eternal generation or advance strong forms of functional subordination; Frame interacts with systematicians and popular-level writers in evangelical debates.
 - Scriptural exegesis centered on Johannine and Pauline Christology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic), eternal generation, Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), revelation (scriptural warrant for Trinitarian terms), attributes of God (immutability, eternity), and theological method (multiperspectivalism applied to doctrinal analysis).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: a sustained defense of the Son as eternally begotten yet truly incarnate - preserving orthodox Trinitarian ontology while making Christology intelligible and faithful to Scripture and classical tradition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Integration of Frame's **multiperspectival method**: treats the doctrine from normative (Scripture/confession), situational (history/exegesis), and existential (practical confession/worship) perspectives to avoid one-sided reductions.
 - Strong insistence that eternal relations within the Trinity have real ontological status distinct from roles in redemption history.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against modern evangelical trends that reduce Sonship to a temporal or merely functional role (e.g., some contemporary accounts of functional subordination).
 - Critiques any neo-Barthian or anti-Augustinian tendencies that minimize eternal generation in order to avoid metaphysical language, arguing that such moves risk doctrinal instability.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of multiperspectival categories to Trinitarian and Christological debates clarifies mistakes that arise from conflating economic and immanent descriptions.
 - Clear taxonomy distinguishing ontological subordination (rejected) from economic ordering (affirmed).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed evangelical seminaries for clarity and polemical usefulness; used as a compact defense of classical positions in classrooms and debates.
 - Influential among students and pastors seeking a concise, biblically-grounded rebuttal to denials of eternal generation.

- **Enduring value**
 - A durable bridge between patristic orthodoxy and contemporary evangelical concerns; useful for teaching Trinitarian basics, diagnosing modern errors, and modeling careful exegetical-theological integration.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's sonship is an eternal relation of origin within the Godhead, not a temporal role assumed only at the Incarnation.
- **Eternal Generation** - The doctrine that the Son is eternally begotten of the Father; ontological, not temporal.
- **Incarnation** - The historical assuming of human nature by the eternal Son; maintains full deity and full humanity in one person.
- **Hypostatic Union** - The personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; Frame upholds Chalcedonian language.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner life and relations (e.g., Father begets Son) - real and ontological.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (e.g., sending the Son) - distinct but related to the immanent relations.
- **Begotten, not made** - Classic anti-Arian formula reaffirmed to protect the Son's deity.
- **Ontological vs. Economic Subordination** - Ontological (denied); economic (acknowledged in redemptive order).
- **Multiperspectivalism** - Frame's method: normative, situational, and existential lenses applied to doctrine.
- **Chalcedonian formula** - Reference point for Frame's Christology: two natures, one person.
- **Kenosis (contextual)** - Discussed with caution: incarnation implies self-emptying in humiliation without loss of deity.
- **Revelation (Scriptural warrant)** - Scripture as controlling norm for articulating inner-Trinitarian language.
- **Begotten language (hermeneutic use)** - Treated as theological description, not an anthropomorphic metaphor to be flattened.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for eternal Sonship and its distinction from mere functional descriptions.
 - As **polemic** against contemporary denials of eternal generation and against ontological subordination.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Johannine Christology applied to Trinitarian doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking orthodox Trinitarian ontology to practical doctrine of Incarnation and worship.
