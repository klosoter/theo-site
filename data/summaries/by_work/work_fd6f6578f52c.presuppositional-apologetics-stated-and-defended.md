### TITLE
Presuppositional Apologetics: Stated and Defended - Greg L. Bahnsen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetics; matured in the 1970s-1980s within the Van Tilian tradition. Bahnsen is a leading exponent of Cornelius Van Til's presuppositional method and engaged contemporary evangelical debates with evidentialists and classical apologists.
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian theism must be **presupposed** as the necessary precondition for intelligible experience, logic, morality, and science; non-Christian worldviews cannot account for the preconditions of rationality.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: the contemporary debate assumes a neutral rational "common ground" between Christian and non-Christian thinkers.
 - Critique: neutralism and evidentialism fail because they presuppose the very standards (logic, moral norms, rationality) they seek to adjudicate without a Christian foundation.
 - Positive proof (Transcendental Argument for God, TAG):
 - Show that the **preconditions of intelligibility** (laws of logic, uniformity of nature, moral obligations, reliable cognition) require the existence of the Christian God.
 - Demonstrate that alternative worldviews lead to absurdity, contradiction, or inability to account for these preconditions.
 - Polemical tactic: force non-Christians to either borrow from Christian presuppositions (and so concede their dependence) or accept intellectual insolvency.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary influence: Cornelius Van Til. Engages with classical and evidentialist apologists (broadly represented by Aristotelian-Platonic or Baconian approaches), and with internal critics (e.g., Gordon H. Clark debates; Bahnsen participated in public debates with prominent atheists).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs general), epistemology (knowability, justification), theology proper (existence and attributes of God), sin and its noetic effects, law and moral ontology, logic and metaphysics.
- **Closing line**
 - Bahnsen's work centers on the claim that **Christian theism is the necessary, nonnegotiable worldview-frame that makes rational discourse and moral knowledge possible**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves apologetics from proof-building toward **worldview confrontation**: apologetics as exposing inconsistent alternatives and vindicating the Christian framework transcendentally.
 - Strong stress on the **noetic effects of sin**-nonbelievers are intellectually impaired regarding ultimate truths.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects the classical "neutral common ground" and evidentialist attempts to build cumulative proofs that remain neutral; challenges presuppositionally naive versions of natural theology.
 - Differs from some other Van Tilians and classical Reformed apologists in methodical rigor and formalization of TAG.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the **Transcendental Argument (TAG)** as the central apologetic tool.
 - Articulation of the apologetic role of **ultimate authority** (God as the epistemic foundation) versus human autonomy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical apologetics; popularized presuppositional methods in seminaries and debates.
 - Criticized by opponents for alleged question-begging and circularity; debated with evidentialists, classical apologists, and philosophers of religion.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a rigorous, polemical model for defending the epistemic priority of Christian revelation and for framing apologetics as worldview analysis and confrontation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Apologetic method that begins by identifying worldviews' basic commitments rather than arguing from neutral facts.
- **Transcendental Argument for God (TAG)**
 - Argues that the preconditions of intelligibility logically entail the Christian God; without God, logic, morals, and science lack foundation.
- **Common ground**
 - The contested idea of a neutral epistemic platform; Bahnsen denies its existence in ultimate matters.
- **Ultimate authority**
 - The source of rational norms and moral law; for Bahnsen, God is the only adequate ultimate authority.
- **Noetic effects of sin**
 - The doctrine that sin corrupts human cognitive faculties and will, producing worldview-hostile biases.
- **General vs Special Revelation**
 - Bahnsen: general revelation discloses God's existence and some attributes but is epistemically insufficient without the interpretive key of special revelation.
 - Special revelation supplies the authoritative framework that makes general revelation intelligible.
- **Worldview**
 - Coherent set of presuppositions that interpret experience; apologetics tests for internal consistency and explanatory power.
- **Epistemological circularity**
 - Anticipated objection: presuppositionalism is circular; Bahnsen argues that *all* ultimate commitments are circular in a virtuous, not vicious, sense.
- **Autonomy of reason**
 - The Enlightenment ideal Bahnsen critiques: reason must be submitted to divine revelation, not considered self-sufficient.
- **Rationality / intelligibility**
 - Treated as dependent on theistic grounding for laws of logic, uniformity of nature, and reliable cognition.
- **Law of non-contradiction**
 - Used as an example of a rational precondition that requires ontological grounding in the mind of God.
- **Polemical/verbal tactics**
 - Use of formal argumentative pressure in debate to force non-Christian interlocutors into inconsistency or concession.

Uses across loci:
- **General and Special Revelation**
 - Employed to argue that general revelation must be read through special revelation; presuppositionalism functions as an interpretive key for assessing the epistemic force of nature's testimony to God.
- **Existence and Knowability of God**
 - TAG is used as a philosophical-theological proof for the necessary existence and knowability of the Christian God: God is presented as the only adequate ontological ground for knowledge, logic, and moral obligation.
