### TITLE
Sermons: Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God - Jonathan Edwards (preached July 8, 1741)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Preached in Enfield, Connecticut during the First Great Awakening (1740-1742); circulated widely in print thereafter.
 - Situated within New England Puritan/Reformed piety but oriented to revivalist pastoral urgency; immediate pastoral aim to awaken unregenerate listeners.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Unregenerate persons remain under the imminent and righteous wrath of God; nothing but sovereign, unmerited divine grace prevents instantaneous damnation.
 - The sermon diagnoses human impotence to secure salvation and calls for immediate conversion.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Opening theological claim: sinners are held over the pit of hell by the mere pleasure of God (provable by Scripture and reason).
 - Exposition of human condition: vivid demonstration of sinfulness, danger, and inability to save oneself.
 - Proofs and illustrations: scriptural appeals, biblical images, and striking metaphors (spider, bow and arrow, great waters) to make danger palpable.
 - Pastoral application: urgent call to immediate repentance and faith; no presumptions about human control over salvation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Builds on Puritan theological inheritance (Calvin, English Puritans) and earlier New England preachers (e.g., Solomon Stoddard).
 - Implicit polemic against Arminian optimism and moralistic religion that presumes human capacity to respond apart from sovereign grace.
 - Uses Scripture as primary authority and engages pastoral literature on conversion.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Total depravity and total inability (anthropology/will)
 - Divine sovereignty and wrath
 - Conversion/regeneration and efficacious grace
 - Judgment, hell, and eschatological consequences
 - Secondary treatment: repentance, faith, means of grace, sanctification as consequence of conversion
- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - The sermon centers on the absolute dependence of sinners on God's sovereign mercy: apart from immediate, transforming grace, every human stands exposed to God's righteous wrath.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Vivid sensory and juridical imagery to render metaphysical truths experientially real; God's "mere pleasure" as the only restraint on damnation.
 - Psychological realism: shows the inner impotence of the will as a pastoral and theological fact, not merely a logical conclusion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Sharply counters Arminian notions of sufficient human ability or prevenient grace that leaves the will able to choose; stresses radical inability.
 - Moves beyond abstract disputation to revivalist rhetoric aimed at immediate conversion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the trope of God's "mere pleasure" as theological shorthand for God's absolute prerogative in salvation.
 - Distinguishes natural/moral inability from physical incapacity in service of Reformed soteriology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in First Great Awakening conversions; became emblematic of revivalist preaching.
 - Polarizing historically: celebrated as authentic Calvinist zeal by supporters; criticized for manipulation and fear-based tactics by opponents.
 - Long-term: shaped American evangelical homiletics and the public imagination of divine wrath and revival.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Model of pastoral theology integrating doctrine and affect: how doctrinal claims function to move conscience.
 - Valuable for students of soteriology, preaching, and the history of American religion as a concentrated case of doctrinal application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity**
 - Humanity's pervasive corruption; Edwards treats this as the root cause of moral inability.
- **Total Inability**
 - The will cannot effect saving change apart from sovereign grace; central to the sermon's pastoral claim.
- **Divine Sovereignty**
 - God's unilateral control over salvation and judgment; expressed in "mere pleasure" language.
- **Wrath of God**
 - Active, just anger toward sin; depicted as immediate and imminent for the unconverted.
- **Mere Pleasure of God**
 - Key phrase indicating no human cause restrains damnation except God's sovereign will.
- **Conversion / Regeneration**
 - Sole remedy; presented as a sovereign act of God that must be sought with urgency.
- **Hell / Eternal Damnation**
 - Real, imminent, and descriptively graphic; used as motivator for repentance.
- **Moral vs. Natural Ability**
 - Edwards emphasizes moral inability (inclination and disposition) rather than physical inability.
- **Scriptural Imagery**
 - Uses concrete metaphors (spider over fire; dangling over pit) to exegetically illustrate doctrinal points.
- **Revivalist Rhetoric**
 - Techniques of fear, awe, and immediate summons to produce conversion.
- **Efficacious Grace**
 - Grace that effectively changes the will; implied as the only possible means of salvation.
- **Pastoral Urgency**
 - The sermon's form exhibits doctrine as immediate pastoral imperative rather than abstract dogma.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: often cited to exemplify classical Reformed affirmations of total depravity and inability.
 - Polemic: used in debates with Arminians and critics of revivalism to illustrate consequences of denying radical depravity.
 - Exegetical/homiletic model: taught as a paradigm for doctrinally charged, affective preaching that seeks conversion.
