### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 1: Prolegomena - Herman Bavinck**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century Dutch Reformed context (published in Dutch, 1895-1901); situated within the Kuyperian neo-Calvinist milieu while engaging liberal theology, historical-critical biblical studies, Romanticism, Kantian and post-Kantian philosophy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To establish a systematic, confessional Reformed theology that is faithful to Scripture and historically rooted yet critically engaged with modern thought; to ground dogmatics methodologically in revelation and Scripture's authority.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definitions and task of theology: theology as reflective, rational exposition of faith rooted in Scripture (faith seeking understanding, yet presupposing divine revelation).
 - Nature and kinds of revelation: careful distinction and relation of **general (common) revelation** and **special revelation**; the role of preparatory/common grace.
 - Bibliology: canonical formation, inspiration, self-attestation, authority, inerrancy/infallibility - a sustained treatment of how Scripture functions as rule and norm.
 - Method: interplay of biblical theology, historical theology, systematic construction, and polemics; emphasis on synthesis of exegesis and dogmatic reflection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, Reformation scholastics.
 - Modern interlocutors: Kant, Schleiermacher, Hegel, contemporary critical scholars; engagement with Kuyperian colleagues and Dutch theological debates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primarily bibliology and prolegomena (revelation, Scripture, inspiration, canon, tradition, theological method); preparatory material touches on Trinity, Christology, pneumatology as loci to be treated in later volumes.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Bavinck's Prolegomena insists that faithful Reformed dogmatics is simultaneously confessional, exegetical, historical, and critically engaged - Scripture is the self-attesting center, mediated by the Spirit and interpreted within the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balanced synthesis of confessional fidelity and critical engagement with modern thought; neither uncritical traditionalism nor capitulation to liberalism.
 - Strong, nuanced account of **Scripture's self-attestation**: Scripture is divinely authoritative and witnesses to itself, yet this self-attestation is experienced and confirmed through the Spirit and ecclesial life.
 - Clear distinction and constructive relation between **common (including preparatory) grace** and special grace (gospel/faith).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushback against Schleiermacher's radical subjectivism and Kantian limitations on knowledge of God; correction of both rationalist and pietistic extremes.
 - Moves beyond rigid Reformation scholasticism by integrating historical consciousness and engagement with modern philosophy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Methodological model combining fourfold movement: biblical exegesis, historical reception, dogmatic construction, and polemical defense.
 - Sharp use of categories like "self-attestation" and "preparatory grace" within a Reformed epistemology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Long-standing authority within Dutch Reformed and neo-Calvinist circles; revived influence in Anglophone Reformed theology after English translation (late 20th/early 21st c.).
 - Esteemed by recent scholars as a corrective to both modernist and pietistic tendencies; frequently recommended alongside Reformation and scholastic sources.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for integrating confessional fidelity, rigorous exegesis, historical awareness, and constructive theology - indispensable for bibliology and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (general / special)** - Distinguishes natural knowledge of God (creation, conscience) from saving revelation in Christ and Scripture; both relate but do not merge.
- **Common grace / Preparatory grace** - God's restraining and enabling work in the non-elect and in the world that prepares conditions for gospel witness.
- **Scripture self-attestation (inner witness)** - Scripture testifies to its own divine origin; this self-witness is actualized by the Spirit in believers and by the church's recognition.
 - Contrast: not mere subjectivism; anchored in objective text and historical testimony.
- **Inspiration and inerrancy** - Scripture is divinely inspired and trustworthy in its teaching; Bavinck defends a robust notion of truthfulness while attending to human authorship.
- **Canon and tradition** - Canon formation is historical and ecclesial; tradition serves as interpretive guard but is subordinate to Scripture as norm.
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology** - Biblical theology traces organic development within Scripture; systematic theology orders and formulates doctrinal truth; both are necessary and complementary.
- **Nature and task of theology** - Theology as a disciplined science of God's revelation: exegetical, historical, constructive, and polemical.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Normative rule for faith and life; authority is intrinsic (divine origin) and mediated in the life of the church.
- **Hermeneutics** - Historicist-grammatical method informed by confessional commitments; resists both purely subjective readings and detached historical skepticism.
- **Continuationism vs cessationism (orienting stance)** - Prefers normative primacy of Scripture and ordinary means; evaluates charismatic claims historically and critically rather than embracing uncritical continuationism.
- **Theological method (fourfold movement)** - Exegesis, history of doctrine, systematic construction, polemic.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for bibliology and theological method - clear terms and framework for Scripture and revelation.
- As a **polemic** against modernist theology and subjectivist epistemologies.
- As an **exegetical and historical model** - exemplary integration of exegesis, patristic/reformation reception, and dogmatic synthesis.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for courses in prolegomena, bibliology, and the relation of faith and reason.
