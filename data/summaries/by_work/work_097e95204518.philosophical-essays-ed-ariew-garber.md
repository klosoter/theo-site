### TITLE
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - Philosophical Essays (ed. Ariew & Garber). Selected essays on theodicy and divine justice collected with editorial apparatus by Daniel Garber and Donald Rutherford Ariew (modern translation/selection). Emphasis here: Leibnizian theodicy essays (Theodicy, correspondence, principled notes).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-early 18th century, high early Enlightenment metaphysics and natural theology.
 - Intellectual milieu: reaction to Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza, Malebranche; correspondence with European savants; rise of skeptical and atheistic critiques (e.g., Bayle), and debates about God, evil, and reason.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Central problem: reconciling the existence of evil with an omnipotent, omnibenevolent, and omniscient God - in short, vindicating divine goodness and justice (theodicy).
 - Thesis: God, by the Principle of Sufficient Reason and moral wisdom, chose the best of all logically possible worlds; evils are compatible with divine goodness because they are consequences of necessary metaphysical conditions and free creaturely agency that conduce to greater goods.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Foundational principles: Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR) and Principle of Non-Contradiction; these constrain what counts as a real possibility.
 - Distinguishes kinds of evils: metaphysical (limits intrinsic to created being), physical (pain, disorder), moral (sin).
 - Major argumentative moves:
 - Show that some evils are inevitable given the fabric of created reality (limitational metaphysical structure).
 - Argue that free rational creatures are necessary for certain higher goods (virtue, merit), and freedom entails possibility of moral evil.
 - Invoke PSR to claim God's choice of this world had sufficient reasons - i.e., it maximizes balance of perfection across all created monads.
 - Appeal to pre-established harmony and monadology to provide an account of created substance and coordination without God's constant intervention violating ordered laws.
- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Cartesian corpus (substance, mechanistic physics), Malebranche (occasionalism), Spinoza (pantheism/necessitarianism), Hobbes (determinism), Bayle (skeptical challenge to theodicy), Augustine and scholastic tradition (sin, privation concept), contemporary correspondents across Europe.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine power and goodness, human freedom and responsibility, creation ex nihilo, metaphysics of substance (monads), moral evil vs. natural evil, theodicy as theological genre.
- **Closing line**
 - Leibniz frames divine justice not as arbitrary fiat but as the rational selection, by a wise Creator, of the best possible order in which limited, free creatures and necessary metaphysical constraints produce a world where the greatest overall perfection coheres.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic use of the Principle of Sufficient Reason to ground theological claims about God's choices.
 - Explicit formulation of theodicy as a philosophical-theological project: explaining God's justice morally and rationally.
 - Fine-grained taxonomy of evils (metaphysical, physical, moral) and appeal to the best-world calculus rather than mere privation talk.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Spinoza and determinists: maintains genuine contingency and creaturely freedom; God's will is not brute necessity.
 - Against Malebranche's occasionalism: offers pre-established harmony and monads to secure lawful order without constant divine intervention.
 - Against skeptics (Bayle): insists reason can vindicate divine goodness even in presence of apparently gratuitous evils.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Principle of Sufficient Reason applied theologically; articulation of "best of all possible worlds" as a normative explanatory tool.
 - Integration of metaphysics (monadology, pre-established harmony) with moral-theological claims about providence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Controversial: lampooned in popular culture (Voltaire's Candide) but profoundly influential in Enlightenment debates about God and reason.
 - Stimulated subsequent apologetics and philosophical theology (Kant's critique of optimistic metaphysics; later responses in Protestant and Catholic thought vary from skeptical to critical engagement).
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable exemplar of rational theodicy; indispensable for advanced study of theodicy, divine justice, and the use of metaphysical principles in theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy**
 - Leibniz's coinage/central project: rational vindication of God's justice in the face of evil.
- **Principle of Sufficient Reason (PSR)**
 - Every truth/fact has a reason; used to explain why God chose this world.
- **Best of all possible worlds**
 - God's choice criterion: the world that maximizes overall perfection consistent with metaphysical constraints.
- **Monad**
 - Simple, indivisible substance; metaphysical atom whose perceptions and appetitions compose the created order.
- **Pre-established harmony**
 - Coordination among monads set by God, obviating direct causal interaction and vindicating lawful providence.
- **Kinds of evil**
 - Metaphysical (limitations), physical (pain, disorder), moral (sin); each has a different justificatory role in the best-world calculus.
- **Freedom and contingency**
 - Real libertarian-style freedom compatible with divine foreknowledge because God chooses a world containing free agents.
- **Omnipotence constrained by reason**
 - God cannot do the logically impossible; hence some limitations of creation are necessary, not defects in power.
- **Privation theory (qualified)**
 - Evil often described as privation of good but treated as real consequences within created order.
- **Sufficient reason for God's will**
 - God's volitions are rational, not arbitrary; moral wisdom explains selection among possibilities.
- **Providence**
 - Rule of God via laws and pre-established harmony, not constant micromanagement.
- **Contingency vs. necessity**
 - Distinguishes creaturely contingency from divine necessity.
- **Best-world calculus**
 - Implicit utilitarian-like aggregation of perfections and defects to evaluate worldhood.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and methodological source for theodicy (how to frame the problem and use metaphysical principles).
- As a polemic resource in debates with determinism, pantheism, and skepticism about divine goodness.
- As a conceptual pivot in discussions of divine attributes (omnipotence, omnibenevolence, wisdom) and their logical limits.
