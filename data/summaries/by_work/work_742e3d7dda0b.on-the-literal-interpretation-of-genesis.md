### TITLE
On the Literal Interpretation of Genesis (De Genesi ad Litteram) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 4th to early 5th century (books written c. 401-415). Augustine, bishop of Hippo, writing within an anti-Manichaean, anti-Pelagian and broadly Platonic/Christian intellectual milieu. Engages Alexandrian allegorical tradition (e.g., Origen) but pushes for theological prudence in exegesis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to read Genesis so that Scripture is neither forced into nonsense nor divorced from faith: preserve the *literal* (historical/grammatical) sense when possible, but allow nonliteral readings where literal claims conflict with reason or revealed truth. Reconcile creation, time, and human origins with Christian doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with principles of interpretation: prioritize the literal/grammatical sense but subordinate it to greater truths when necessary; consider authorial intent, context, and God's transcendence.
 - Treats cosmology: affirms creation ex nihilo; argues time began with creation - there was no "before" time for God to act in chronological sequence.
 - Discusses the six days: offers flexibility - God's creative act may be understood as simultaneous underlying a staged narrative for human comprehension; "days" need not equal 24-hour periods.
 - Anthropology and sin: Adam as first man and representative; human soul created by God (not eternally preexistent); sin (concupiscence) entered history via Adam, with transmission to posterity - central in polemic against Pelagian minimization of original sin.
 - Eschatology and redemption: bodily resurrection and restoration envisaged as return to intended order; creation's telos is re-creation in Christ.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Opposes Manichaean dualism and Origenizing excesses; later writes against Pelagius and Julian of Eclanum, using Genesis reading to ground doctrines of original sin and grace.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical hermeneutics; creation ex nihilo; time and metaphysics; anthropology (soul/body unity); sin and its transmission; a proto-covenantal imagination (Adam as representative); resurrection and new creation.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine locates Genesis at the intersection of literal history and theological typology: the text must be read so that it honors reason and the Christian truths of creation, fall, and redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes **time as a created dimension**, not an attribute of God; creation includes the ontology of time.
 - Advocates a **measured literalism**: a commitment to historical reading tempered by philosophical and theological constraints.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Manichaean cosmology by insisting on single divine creation ex nihilo and the goodness of created matter.
 - Counters overly fanciful allegory (Alexandrian excess) by insisting on strict exegetical criteria.
 - Serves as decisive foil to Pelagianism: uses Genesis to argue for inherited sin and the necessity of prevenient/sovereign grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Develops influential language regarding **concupiscence** as the disordered desire transmitted to posterity and central to original sin debates.
 - Frames Adam as a **representative (federal) head**, a motif that later Reformed covenant theology would formalize.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Hugely influential in medieval Latin theology and in shaping Augustine's reputation as the principal Western interpreter of Genesis.
 - Integral to Reformation and post-Reformation debates about original sin, covenant theology, and creation; a primary source for later anthologies on hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models an integrated approach: careful philology allied to metaphysical reflection and pastoral concern; indispensable for studies in creation, sin, grace, and biblical interpretation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation ex nihilo**
 - God creates "out of nothing"; challenges any notion of preexistent matter.
- **Time as creature**
 - Time begins with creation; no "before" in temporal terms.
- **Literal vs. figurative (littera / sensus)**
 - Priority of literal/grammatical sense, but openness to allegory where literal understanding would contradict reason or faith.
- **Six days of creation**
 - Ambiguous: may be temporal stages for pedagogy or a framework for simultaneous creation; Augustine resists rigid 24-hour reading.
- **Adam as representative (federal head)**
 - Adam's act has corporate consequences for humanity; grounds later covenant of works language.
- **Original sin / concupiscence**
 - Sin introduced by Adam; transmitted through concupiscence (disordered desire) affecting will and body - key in anti-Pelagian polemic.
- **Human nature: psychosomatic unity**
 - Rejects full trichotomy; emphasizes unity of body and soul and their mutual relation.
- **Resurrection and new creation**
 - Final restoration of body and soul; eschatological consummation is a re-creation.
- **Vocation, dominion, culture mandate**
 - Adam's mandate to subdue the earth is real and normative for human vocation, though marred by fall.
- **Hypothetical Adam (what if he had not sinned)**
 - Augustine speculates on possible outcomes; maintains contingency while affirming God's sovereignty and the necessity of grace.
- **Allegory and typology**
 - Uses typological reading where Christ and sacraments are prefigured, without abandoning historical grounding.
- **Hermeneutical rule**
 - Scripture should never be interpreted in a way that conflicts with clearer truths of faith and right reason.
- **Trichotomy vs dichotomy**
 - Augustine leans to dichotomy (body + soul/spirit unity) against strict tripartite anthropologies.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **hermeneutical model** for reading Genesis (linguistic-historical with philosophical correction).
 - As a **polemic source** against Manichaeism and Pelagianism (original sin and grace).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for doctrines of federal headship, creation ex nihilo, and the relation of time to creation.
