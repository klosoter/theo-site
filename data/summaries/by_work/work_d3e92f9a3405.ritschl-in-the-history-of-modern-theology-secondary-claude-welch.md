### TITLE
Ritschl in the History of Modern Theology - Albrecht Ritschl (secondary lens: Claude Welch)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; reaction to Hegelian metaphysics, Enlightenment historicism, and pietistic introspection.
 - Emergence of a Protestant liberal or "ethical-historical" school; institutional influence at Göttingen and Erlangen and later through followers (e.g., Herrmann, Troeltsch).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must ground itself in the moral-religious consciousness and historical action of Jesus; speculative metaphysics and ontological claims about God and Christ must be removed from systematic theology.
 - The core task: explain how God's redeeming will is known and appropriated by human persons and communities (the church) without recourse to metaphysical union or forensic metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology as a normative practical science: begins with the religious value-judgment (the moral evaluation of Jesus and his work).
 - Revelation is historical and relational: God's self-manifestation is an accommodation to moral-human consciousness.
 - Christology reframed: Jesus is the unique historical bearer and founder of the Kingdom of God; his role is ethical-historical mediation rather than metaphysical God-man ontology.
 - Soteriology reframed: salvation is incorporation into the moral community (the church) and participation in the redeeming will of God - a relational/ethical union more than ontological infusion.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Against Hegelian idealism (speculative metaphysics) and orthodox scholasticism (objective forensic schemes).
 - In dialogue with Schleiermacher (feeling of absolute dependence), but rejects reduction to subjective religious feeling.
 - Claude Welch reads Ritschl as pivotal for Protestant modernity, noting both corrective power and limitations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology, soteriology (union with Christ), ecclesiology (community as locus of salvation), epistemology (value-judgment), and doctrine of God (ethical will).
 - Incarnation and accommodation considered as analogical categories for understanding revelation.
- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl's theological center of gravity: theology as an ethical-historical discipline where Christ is the moral-historical mediator whose redeeming will forms a communal union with believers through revealed, accommodated acts rather than metaphysical union.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Theology grounded in the moral-religious value-judgment: ethical appraisal of Jesus' person and work is primary epistemic and normative act.
 - Emphasis on the church as concrete moral community (Gemeinschaft) in which salvation is realized.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Removes Hegelian metaphysics from Christology and rejects scholastic forensic categories of substitutionary mechanism as metaphysical.
 - Distances itself from Schleiermacher's emphasis on religious feeling by insisting on objective historical acts as the basis of faith.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Value-judgment" (Werturteil) as theological method.
 - Recasting "union with Christ" as ethical fellowship and communal incorporation rather than ontological mystical participation.
 - Use of "accommodation" and an "incarnational analogy" to explain how transcendent divine will becomes knowable within historical human forms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on Protestant liberal theology; shaped late-19th and early-20th-century German theology and North American theological education.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodoxy (Barth) for reducing divine transcendence and undermining Christ's unique metaphysical status; praised by liberals for historicizing revelation.
 - Claude Welch highlights both Ritschl's methodological clarity and limitations in addressing metaphysical and sacramental dimensions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for ethics-focused theological reflection, historically sensitive Christology, and a non-metaphysical account of revelation useful in contemporary constructive and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)**
 - Theology begins with ethical evaluation of Jesus' life and significance; normative starting point for doctrine.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Understood as ethical-relational incorporation into the community founded by Jesus; participation in the redeeming will rather than metaphysical ontological fusion.
- **Accommodation**
 - God's self-expression is adapted to finite moral consciousness; revelation is communicative and pedagogical, not ontologically exhaustive.
- **Incarnational analogy**
 - The incarnation functions as the analogical model for how divine will becomes accessible: historical, contingent, and morally formative revelation.
- **Kingdom of God (Reich Gottes)**
 - Central eschatological-ethical reality instituted by Jesus; locus of salvation and communal life.
- **Religious community (Gemeinschaft)**
 - The church as the practical sphere where justification and sanctification are experienced and judged.
- **Moral-historical mediation**
 - Christ's redemptive role framed as historical mediation of God's ethical will, not metaphysical hypostasis.
- **Theology as normative practical science**
 - Theology aims to guide moral-religious life through historical judgments, not to construct metaphysical systems.
- **Historical consciousness**
 - Emphasis on events and deeds (Jesus' life and acts) as primary data for theology.
- **Ethical will of God**
 - God revealed primarily as one who demands and realizes ethical moral transformation, contrasted with speculative attributes.
- **Objective vs. subjective justification**
 - Ritschl privileges communal, ethical justification (objective in historical effect) over metaphysical forensic categories.
- **Religious valuation**
 - The process by which communities recognize the saving value of Jesus' work.
- **Mediator / Founder**
 - Titles for Christ that stress his role in founding an ethical kingdom rather than an ontological union.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a definition source: to articulate an ethical-historical account of "union with Christ" and communal incorporation.
 - As a polemic: to challenge metaphysical and forensic accounts of atonement and to critique overly speculative Christologies.
 - As an exegetical model: for readings of Scripture that prioritize historical acts and ethical meaning over metaphysical assertions.
 - As a conceptual pivot: "accommodation" and "incarnational analogy" inform contemporary debates on revelation, contextualization, and the limits of theological language.
