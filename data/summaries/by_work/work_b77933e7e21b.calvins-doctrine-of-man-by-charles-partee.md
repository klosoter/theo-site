### TITLE
Calvin's Doctrine of Man - Charles Partee (on John Calvin)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century historical-theological study of a 16th-century Reformer. Partee reads Calvin within the Protestant Reformation and the wider patristic/scholastic conversation; attention to classical sources (Augustine, Jerome) and contemporaries (Luther, Melanchthon).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Partee argues that Calvin offers a distinctively Reformed anthropological synthesis: a robust psychosomatic unity of personhood shaped by Scripture, subsidiarily shaped against both medieval scholastic dualisms and popular speculative accounts of soul origin and composition.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: Calvin grounds anthropology in Scripture and covenantal theology rather than speculative metaphysics.
 - Descriptive: Careful exposition of Calvin's texts to show his positions on (1) the unity of body and soul, (2) the origin of the soul (traducianism vs creationism), and (3) the relation of soul and spirit (trichotomy/dichotomy).
 - Evaluative: Partee measures Calvin against Augustine, medieval thinkers, and later Reformed interpreters to show both continuity and innovation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Augustine (primary classic), scholastic theologians (notably Thomists), Luther, contemporaries in Reformed Geneva, and later Reformed anthropologists. Partee also dialogues with modern interpreters on analytic categories (psychosomatic, trichotomy).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (nature of man, image of God), original sin and its transmission, union with Christ (soteriological implications for human nature), and pastoral/ethical implications of human constitution.
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's anthropology anchors human identity and sin in a Scriptural psychosomatic unity, resisting speculative metaphysics while providing a theological platform for Reformed ethics and soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Calvin stresses **psychosomatic unity**: soul and body form a single moral and existential subject; language of "soul" and "spirit" is often functional and interchangeable rather than strictly ontological.
 - Strong pastoral and covenantal framing: anthropology serves proclamation and sanctification, not abstract ontology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves against both radical scholastic dualism (sharp separation of soul/body) and unreflective folk-philosophy; Calvin neither naturalizes the soul nor subjects it to speculative emanation.
 - Partee highlights Calvin's rejection of traducianism in favour of immediate divine origination of the soul, contrasting him with some medieval and Lutheran tendencies.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of covenantal and ecclesial categories to ground anthropology (the "image of God" as relational and functional within communion).
 - Fluid use of "spirit" and "soul" that anticipates later Reformed clarity regarding psychological language.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Calvin's anthropology, as explicated by Partee, became a touchstone for Reformed systematicians: shaping subsequent Protestant positions on the soul's origin, the unity of person, and pastoral theology regarding sin and sanctification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced biblical-theological model that resists reduction to either philosophical materialism or speculative dualism; valuable for ethics, pastoral practice, and doctrinal formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Calvin's view that **body and soul constitute one human subject**; moral responsibility and personal identity are attributable to the composite person.
- **Image of God (Imago Dei)**
 - Not merely rational faculty but relational/functionalist: ruling, knowing, and covenantal capacities oriented to God and neighbor.
- **Original sin / corruption (peccatum originale)**
 - Transmission of guilt/propensity affecting the whole person; not a merely legal imputation but a pervasive deformation of the psychosomatic whole.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Soteriological center that restores human nature; anthropology tied to redemption and sanctification, not only creation.
- **Traducianism**
 - The view that the soul is transmitted from parents with the body; Partee shows Calvin **rejects** this in favour of direct divine origination.
 - Contrast: traducianism implies continuity of sin's transmission via human procreation; Calvin prefers divine origination while still accounting for inherited corruption.
- **Creationism (soul)**
 - Calvin's inclination: the soul is **immediately created by God** at conception/formation, preserving God's direct sovereignty over spiritual life.
- **Dichotomy (body/soul)**
 - Calvin's practical default: humans are often treated as twofold (body plus soul/spirit) because Scripture uses soul and spirit interchangeably in function.
- **Trichotomy (body/soul/spirit)**
 - Calvin does not systematically adopt a strict trichotomy; where Scripture distinguishes, he respects terms but avoids rigid ontological partitioning.
- **Soul and Spirit (term use)**
 - Functional overlap; "spirit" often denotes relational orientation to God, "soul" the seat of life - but Calvin refuses sharp taxonomic separation.
- **Moral agency / responsibility**
 - Attributed to the whole person; underscores pastoral implications for blame, repentance, and sanctification.
- **Ancillary: Ecclesial anthropology**
 - The human person is defined in relation to covenant and church life; anthropology serves ecclesiology and sacramental practice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed anthropological commitments (psychosomatic unity, creationism of soul).
 - As a **polemic resource** against traducianist or speculative trichotomist readings claiming Calvinian support.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical anthropology: careful lexical and contextual attention to "soul" and "spirit."
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of creation, doctrine of sin, and soteriology in Reformed theology.
