### TITLE
The Divine Image in Man - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton-Reformed milieu; Warfield writes against naturalistic reductions of human nature and against overly speculative philosophical anthropology emerging from German idealism and early psychology. He writes as a confessional Calvinist engaged with modern science and biblical exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The image of God (imago Dei) is a real, scriptural, and theologically central aspect of human nature that grounds human dignity, moral responsibility, and the possibility of restoration in Christ. Warfield seeks a balanced account that is neither purely substantive-materialist nor purely functional-relational.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical groundwork: Survey of biblical texts that speak of "image" and "likeness" (Genesis 1-2, Psalmic and prophetic uses, NT Christological references).
 - Anthropological claim: The image is rooted in the whole person - spiritual capacities (intellect, moral will, affections) in a psychosomatic unity rather than a detachable immaterial "something."
 - Polemic move: Rejection of extremes - he opposes reduction to mere function (image = task), and he criticizes purely philosophical definitions that divorce biblical language from soteriological and Christological contexts.
 - Doctrinal culmination: Christ as the perfect image (Colossians 1; Hebrews) who restores the image in redeemed humanity through incarnation, atonement, and sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (primary); Fathers (Augustine), Reformation teachers (especially Calvin), contemporary Protestant scholarship at Princeton, and critics from modern psychology and philosophical anthropology (broadly represented rather than named specialists).
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (psychosomatic unity), Hamartiology (effect of sin on the image), Christology (Christ as the archetypal image), Soteriology (restoration of the image), and implicit Trinitarian grounding (relational language of image rooted in divine personal life).
- **Closing line:** Warfield anchors the imago Dei in the concrete, unified human person - spiritual capacities integrated with bodily life - and centers Christ as the historical and soteriological fulfillment and restoration of that image.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **psychosomatic unity**: Warfield refuses a crude soul-body dualism and insists the image pertains to the human person as an integrated psychosomatic subject.
 - Balanced **substantive-functional synthesis**: He affirms real capacities (reason, moral will) while maintaining that these are ordered to God-relationship and vocational calling.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects overly functional readings that make the image merely a task (dominion); also corrects speculative metaphysical readings that reify the image as an independent immaterial "thing."
 - Pushes back on modern naturalism that erases divine likeness by reducing humans to biological organisms.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-articulates classic terms (image, likeness) within empirical consciousness of modern psychology without abandoning confessional categories; stresses relational and moral dimensions in conjunction with cognitive capacities.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed anthropology and in Princeton-descended scholarship; used as a corrective to both liberal and materialist anthropology in 20th-century evangelical thought.
 - Influenced treatments of Christology that emphasize incarnation as restoration of human nature rather than mere exemplarism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and sensitivity to scientific psychology; remains a go-to resource when defending human dignity, moral responsibility, and Christocentric anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** Central term; for Warfield it denotes likeness grounded in capacities (intellect, will, affections) and relational orientation toward God.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Human person conceived as inseparable unity of soul/spirit and body; the image pertains to the whole person.
- **Substantive view:** Emphasis on real capacities and qualities (reason, moral faculty) that constitute the image - affirmed but not abstracted from embodiment.
- **Functional view:** The thesis that image equals human function (e.g., dominion) - Warfield critiques reductionist forms while allowing functional implications.
- **Likeness vs. Image:** Distinction sometimes drawn biblically; Warfield treats likeness as relational/moral realization of the image rather than a separate ontological entity.
- **Corruption of the image (Hamartiological effect):** Sin distorts but does not utterly annihilate the image; grounds both culpability and hope for restoration.
- **Restoration in Christ:** Christ as the perfect image and the means by which the image is renewed in believers.
- **Anthropological dignity:** Practical implication - image grounds human worth and ethical obligations (social, legal, ecclesial).
- **Trinitarian foundation (implicit):** The relationality of God provides a theological basis for human relationality and moral capacity as image-bearing.
- **Exegetical anchor texts:** Genesis 1-2; Colossians 1; Hebrews/Pauline references to Christ as image.
- **Relation to modern psychology:** Warfield engages contemporary psychological claims cautiously, insisting theology judges anthropology rather than being driven by speculative science.
- **Original righteousness:** The normative state in which the image was rightly ordered toward God; used diagnostically in hamartiology and soteriology.
- **Incarnation as ontological restoration:** The Son assumes human nature to heal and perfect the image, not merely to exemplify moral likeness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source in Christian anthropology (provides a measured substantive-functional account).
- As a polemic resource against naturalistic and reductionist accounts of human nature.
- As an exegetical-model for reading Genesis and Pauline image-language with Christocentric and soteriological lenses.
