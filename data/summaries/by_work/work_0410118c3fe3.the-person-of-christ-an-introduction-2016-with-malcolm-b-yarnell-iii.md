### TITLE
**The Person of Christ: An Introduction** (2016), Stephen Wellum with Malcolm B. Yarnell III

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in a contemporary Reformed-evangelical milieu (2016). Emerges amid renewed evangelical interest in robust Christology, dialoguing with modern historical-critical scholarship, continental theology (e.g., Moltmann, Pannenberg), and intra-evangelical debates about the incarnation (especially kenosis theories). Intended for seminarians and pastors as a systematic, biblically grounded introduction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defends a classical Chalcedonian/hypostatic union Christology against modern distortions (notably kenotic formulations) by affirming that the eternal Son assumed human nature without relinquishing divine being or attributes; incarnation entails real self-emptying in role and function, not loss of deity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Biblical-theological exposition of the person of Christ (OT anticipations, Gospel portraits, Pauline and Johannine witnesses).
 - Historical retrieval of the Nicene and Chalcedonian formulations, with attention to patristic moderators (Athanasius, Cyril) and Reformation/Reformed emphases.
 - Systematic articulation of the hypostatic union: unity of person, distinction of natures, communicatio idiomatum.
 - Critical engagement with modern alternatives:
 - Kenosis theories (ontological vs functional) and their exegetical bases (esp. Phil 2:5-11).
 - Other deviations (adoptionism, modernist reductions, Nestorian tendencies).
 - Practical/doctrinal ramifications for soteriology, atonement, union with Christ, and worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary texts: Scripture (Philippians 2, John, Hebrews, the Gospels), Chalcedon 451, Nicene formulations, patristic and Reformation sources.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of kenotic Christology and theologians emphasizing divine vulnerability (e.g., those influenced by Moltmann/Pannenberg trajectories) and evangelical critics.
 - Coauthor Yarnell contributes Reformed-covenantal sensibilities to the exposition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology centrally; intersections with Trinity (eternal Sonship, economic vs. immanent relations), revelation, incarnation, atonement, soteriology, communicatio idiomatum, and implications for ecclesiology and worship.
- **Closing line:** Argues that a biblically faithful, historically orthodox Christology preserves the full deity and full humanity of Christ by locating kenosis within the economy of the Son's voluntary self-limitation in role and action, not a renunciation of divine being.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong Reformed commitment to Chalcedonian orthodoxy married to careful biblical exegesis; resists modern tendencies to read Phil 2 as mandating ontological loss of deity.
 - Distinguishes clearly between *ontological* depletion (rejected) and *functional/volitional* self-emptying (defended).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects kenotic formulations that posit the Son surrendered essential attributes (omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence), arguing such moves produce Nestorian fragmentation or functional reductionism.
 - Contrasts with theologians who prioritize God's vulnerability at the cost of God's immutable deity-re-balances divine immutability with Christ's genuine human reception of suffering.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and insists on precise usage of "kenosis" categories (ontological vs. economic/functional), promoting disciplined exegetical thresholds before adopting theological constructs.
 - Emphasizes a covenantal-soteriological framing for understanding the incarnation (what the Son assumes in order to accomplish redemption).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received positively in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear corrective and teaching resource; used in seminary courses as an accessible, orthodox introduction.
 - Functions as a touchstone in debates over evangelical engagements with contemporary Trinitarian and kenotic theologies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise, theologically robust primer linking biblical exegesis, patristic orthodoxy, and systematic concerns-useful for pastors, students, and scholars confronting kenotic proposals.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union:** The union of two natures (divine and human) in the one person (hypostasis) of the Son; central organizing category.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The reciprocal attribution of properties of each nature to the one person without confusion or division.
- **Kenosis:** "Self-emptying" (Phil 2:7) - distinguished as:
 - **Ontological kenosis:** Claim that the Son divested divine attributes (rejected).
 - **Functional/economic kenosis:** Voluntary limitation of the divine exercise of attributes in the incarnate mission (affirmed).
- **Philippians 2:5-11:** Exegetical pivot text; read as vocational/functional kenosis within incarnation, not as metaphysical loss of deity.
- **Eternal Sonship:** The Son's eternal relation within the Trinity, preserved in incarnation; guards against adoptionist readings.
- **Chalcedonian formula:** The authoritative standard-two natures "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
- **Ontological vs. economic Trinity:** Distinction upheld-incarnation pertains to the economic economy, not a change in the immanent Trinity.
- **Divine attributes:** Omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence-argued to remain essential to the Son's being even in the incarnation (though their exercise may be voluntarily veiled).
- **Impassibility vs. passibility:** Maintains Chalcedonian balance: eternal impassibility of the divine nature but real passibility in the Son's human nature.
- **Covenantal framing:** Incarnation as covenantal fulfillment-Christ assumes human nature within redemptive-historical covenant purposes.
- **Nestorian and Eutychian errors:** Errors to avoid-over-separation of natures (Nestorianism) and mixture/absorption of natures (Eutychianism).
- **Economic limitation:** Theologically precise term for the Son's voluntary self-limitation in mission without ontological subtraction.
- **Soteriological implications:** Correct Christology undergirds atonement, mediator role, and union with believers; wrong Christology undermines redemption.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** of orthodox Christology for seminarians and pastors.
 - As a **polemic** and corrective against contemporary kenotic and vulnerability-of-God theologies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 and integrating biblical texts into systematic Christology.
