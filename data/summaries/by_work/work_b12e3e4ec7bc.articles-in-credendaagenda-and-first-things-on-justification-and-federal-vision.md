### TITLE
Peter J. Leithart - Articles in Credenda/Agenda and First Things on Justification and Federal Vision

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 2000s to 2010s debates within conservative Reformed and broader evangelical circles.
 - Published in Credenda/Agenda (a neo‑Reformed/Christian cultural journal) and First Things (ecumenical public theology journal).
 - Part of the larger **Federal Vision** controversy that prompted denominational responses and synodical inquiries in several Reformed bodies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Reframe justification within a robust covenantal and participatory account of union with Christ, resisting what Leithart views as an abstracted, purely forensic legalism that severs justification from covenantal life, sacraments, and sanctification.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Critique of a narrow forensic model of justification that isolates imputed righteousness from actual union with Christ and covenantal status.
 - Positive proposal: justification should be understood as **covenantal membership and participation** in Christ - an objective standing grounded in federal (representative) acts and realized in baptism, faith, repentance, and obedient life.
 - Emphasizes baptism as a means of incorporation (sign and instrument) into covenantal life.
 - Stresses the indispensability of persevering faith and good works as evidence of covenant reality, not as meritorious causes of justification.
 - Argues for a tighter integration of **justification, sanctification, and ecclesiology** - justification is not merely forensic declaration but the beginning of covenantal restoration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Traditional Reformed confessions and the Westminster theology as primary background.
 - Dialogues with contemporary Reformed critics (denominational study reports, theologians defending classical imputation).
 - Appeals to biblical exegesis (Pauline corpus, covenant texts), patristic and medieval covenantal imagery.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, imputation, sanctification, covenant theology (federal headship), sacraments (baptism), ecclesiology, union with Christ, and faith/works relation.
- **Closing line**
 - Leithart's essays aim to relocate justification within an incarnational, covenantal matrix: justification is not merely a forensic declaration but the conferral of covenantal status realized and mediated by union with Christ and the church's sacramental life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses **objective covenantal incorporation** (via baptism and federal representation) as the ground of justified status.
 - Argues for a rehabilitated role for sacraments as instruments, not mere signs, of covenantal reality.
 - Treats justification and sanctification as distinguishable but inseparable poles of one covenantal economy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges an atomized, imputation‑only account that detaches justification from corporate and sacramental realities.
 - Pushes back against caricatures of "works‑righteousness" by insisting works are necessary evidence of true covenant standing, not the ground of it.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reasserts the language of **federal** (representative) union as central, while reinterpreting the forensic vocabulary to include covenantal status and participation.
 - Reframes "justification" toward a relational‑participatory horizon without wholly abandoning forensic categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly controversial: spawned intense critique from many within classical Reformed denominations and prompted formal denominational reviews.
 - Influential in certain conservative, confessional circles seeking to recover sacramental and covenantal breadth within Reformed theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes reexamination of how Pauline soteriology, sacramentology, and covenant theology integrate.
 - Useful as a corrective for reductive forensic readings and as a case study in theological method where doctrine must be read corporately and sacramentally.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision**
 - A movement or cluster of theological proposals emphasizing federal/representative union, covenantal objectivity, and sacramental efficacy.
- **Justification**
 - Leithart: a covenantal conferral of status rooted in union with Christ - both declaration and incorporation, not only forensic reckoning.
- **Imputation**
 - Not denied, but reinterpreted within corporate federal headship: righteousness is both declared and participated in through Christ.
- **Covenantal union / federal headship**
 - Central category: Christ as federal representative unites elect to his righteousness and obedience.
- **Baptism (incorporation)**
 - Treated as a means/instrument of being placed into covenantal standing and union with Christ.
- **Forensic justification**
 - Classical legal language retained but supplemented with participatory and covenantal descriptors; Leithart resists isolating forensic language from relational realities.
- **Sanctification**
 - Evidential and inseparable from true justification - good works mediating covenantal reality without meriting status.
- **Objective justification**
 - Emphasis on real, objective aspects of salvation (what Christ has done for the covenant people) as distinct from subjective appropriation.
- **Faith and works**
 - Faith is the means of receiving covenant status; works are necessary evidences of genuine faith and covenant vitality.
- **Sola fide (reframed)**
 - Retained as principle of receiving justification by faith, but embedded in covenantal, ecclesial, and sacramental context.
- **Sacramental realism**
 - A thicker view of sacraments as participatory instruments of grace within covenant.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological axis for soteriology; participation explains how righteousness accrues to believers.
- **Use across loci**
 - Employed as a **polemic** against abstract forensic/individualistic formulations of justification.
 - Used as an **exegetical model** for Pauline texts emphasizing union and participation.
 - Serves as a **conceptual pivot** in rethinking sacraments, ecclesiology, and the faith/works relation in Reformed theology.
