### TITLE
**Divine Discourse: Philosophical Reflections on the Claim that God Speaks (1995)** 
Nicholas Wolterstorff - analytic philosopher of religion, Reformed theological sensibility; interdisciplinary treatment at the intersection of philosophy of language, epistemology, and theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1990s analytic theology; growing interest in religious epistemology after the revival of Reformed epistemology (Plantinga, Alston).
 - Cross-disciplinary move: bringing speech-act theory (Austin, Searle) and analytic tools to questions of revelation and religious experience.
 - Pastoral and confessional concerns about how God addresses persons in contemporary contexts.

- **Central thesis**
 - **God does and can speak to human persons in a literal, non-metaphorical way**, and such speech can be epistemically significant - it can give warrant and moral obligation without being reducible to merely propositional evidence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary: distinguish types of language about God (metaphoric, analogical, literal) and problematize eliminativist readings that relegate all talk of God "speaking" to metaphor.
 - Deploy speech-act theory to analyze what it is to speak (illocutionary force, perlocution) and show how divine acts can be classified analogously.
 - Major move: identify kinds of divine speech acts (promises, commands, declarations, admonitions) and how they function in human life.
 - Epistemic claim: if God speaks, hearers can acquire rational belief and obligation from that address - so divine speech is a proper source of warrant.
 - Address objections: divine immutability and temporality, the problem of verification (hiddenness, ambiguity), and abuses (delusion, false prophets).
 - Offer criteria for recognizing genuine divine address: communal checks, continuity with covenantal revelation, moral fruit, and epistemic humility.
 - Conclude with implications for doctrine (revelation, prophecy, Scripture), pastoral practice, and philosophical theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophers of language: J.L. Austin, John Searle (speech-act theory).
 - Contemporary epistemologists: interlocutors from Reformed epistemology (implicit dialogue with Alvin Plantinga et al.).
 - Biblical and theological resources: biblical paradigms of divine speech (prophets, promises), Reformed theological concerns (covenant speech), and engagement with broader Christian and philosophical tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs. general), prophecy, covenantal speech acts, divine command and law, assurance and religious epistemology, testimonial status of Scripture.

- **Closing line**
 - Wolterstorff centers theology on **God as communicative agent**: divine speech is real, normative, and epistemically relevant, reshaping how revelation and religious knowledge should be understood.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats divine address not merely as metaphor but as a category analyzable by contemporary speech-act theory; insists on the variety of illocutionary forms in divine-human communication.
 - Emphasizes relational and covenantal contexts for discernment of divine speech, not private isolated cognition.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against evidentialist and eliminativist tendencies that demand proof-like propositions before granting any epistemic weight to reports of divine speech.
 - Supplements rather than replaces Reformed epistemology by providing a positive account of how God's speech can produce warranted belief.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Application of speech-act notions (illocution, perlocution) to God-human interaction; introduces criteria for discerning divine speech acts within a communal and normative theological framework.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of religion and analytic theology; influenced subsequent work on divine action, prophecy, and the epistemology of religious experience.
 - Provoked constructive debate over verification, the boundary between experience and delusion, and pastoral safeguards for claims of divine address.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a bridge for pastors, theologians, and analytic philosophers: clarifies how talk of God "speaking" can be coherent, responsible, and epistemically grounded.
 - Useful for contemporary discussions on prophecy, conscience, and the normative weight of perceived divine communications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine speech** - the claim that God utters or communicates in a manner capable of addressing human agents.
- **Speech-act theory** - analytic framework (Austin, Searle) used to identify illocutionary force and perlocutionary effects; central methodological tool.
 - **Illocutionary act** - what a speaker does in saying something (command, promise); applied to God's communicative acts.
 - **Perlocutionary effect** - effects produced in hearers (belief, repentance, comfort).
- **Illocutionary recognition** - criteria by which hearers and communities discern genuine divine address.
- **Covenantal address** - emphasis that God's speech is embedded in covenantal relations (promises, laws, forgiveness).
- **Epistemic warrant** - account of how divine speech can confer justified belief or knowledge, not reducible to evidential proof.
- **Sensus divinitatis (implicit relation)** - resonance with Reformed idea that humans are disposed to perceive divine address (Wolterstorff frames but does not simply restate Calvin).
- **Hiddenness and ambiguity** - challenges to identification and verification of divine speech; treated with communal and moral criteria.
- **Prophetic speech** - biblical paradigm for authoritative, authoritative divine address; model for detecting voice and content.
- **Testimony and Scripture** - relation between immediate divine speech and canonical testimony; Scripture as recorded archive of divine speech acts.
- **Moral fruit** - pragmatic criterion: authenticity of divine speech correlated with moral transformation and coherence with revealed will.
- **Auditory vs. non-auditory forms** - God's speech may be perceived in varied modes (sensory voice, impressions, providential signs).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in religious epistemology: grounding claims that divine address can be epistemically legitimate.
- As a **polemic** against eliminativist and strict evidentialist approaches to revelation and religious experience.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for understanding prophecy, assurance, and the responsible reception of perceived divine communications.
