### TITLE
New Dictionary of Biblical Theology - edited by T. Desmond Alexander (with contributions including D. A. Carson)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical resurgence in interest in biblical-theological methods; reaction both to purely systematic abstractions and to reductionist historical-critical readings.
 - Produced within anglophone evangelical scholarship (seminary and university contexts) as a reference to ground theology in the canon.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Biblical theology is a distinct discipline that aims to describe the theological claims of the biblical authors, trace the historical and canonical development of theological themes, and show how Scripture as a whole testifies to Christ.
 - Seeks to mediate between descriptive, historically sensitive exegesis and normative theological synthesis without collapsing one into the other.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Organized as a dictionary of thematic and person/place entries that survey biblical data, interpretive options, and theological significance.
 - Major moves in entries:
 - Survey of primary biblical texts and textual-theological patterns.
 - Historical/canonical trajectory: how a theme develops from promise to fulfillment.
 - Theological synthesis: implications for doctrine and for contemporary theology.
 - Methodologically pluralistic: recognizes literary, historical, canonical, and theological readings; emphasizes careful exegesis as the basis for theological claims.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with the work of Geerhardus Vos, Gerhard von Rad, Brevard Childs, Walter Brueggemann, James Barr, and contemporary biblical theologians (including evangelical voices like Goldsworthy and Wright).
 - Engages both OT and NT corpora, secondary literature across historical-critical and canonical schools.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant(s), promise/fulfillment, kingdom of God, Christology, revelation, typology, eschatology, Israel-church relations, law and grace, temple/priests, messianic expectation.
- **Closing line**
 - The volume's theological center of gravity: a **canonical-historical, Christocentric, covenantal** reading of Scripture that insists theology must be rooted in the flow of biblical revelation rather than abstracted from it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the discipline of biblical theology as an integrative bridge between rigorous exegesis and doctrinal synthesis; persistent insistence on canonical context and narrative trajectory.
 - Emphasizes **progressive revelation** culminating in Christ as the hermeneutical key.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects systematic theology that treats doctrines as timeless propositional atoms removed from history and canonical form.
 - Distinguishes itself from older "history of religion" approaches by prioritizing theological intent of biblical authors rather than reconstructing pre-biblical religious milieus.
 - Affirms many of Brevard Childs' canonical insights while maintaining stronger ties to historic evangelical doctrinal commitments.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes a working taxonomy for tracing **theological trajectories** (promise → development → fulfillment).
 - Clarifies terminological use between descriptive "what the Bible says" and normative theological appropriation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries as a reference work; respected for balance between careful exegesis and theological sensitivity.
 - Influential in shaping curricula that give biblical theology a central place before or alongside systematic theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a teaching and research resource: compact surveys of themes, entry-level bibliographies, and cross-canonical syntheses useful for students, pastors, and scholars.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - Discipline describing theology of biblical authors and tracking development across canon.
- **Canonical approach**
 - Reading texts within final canonical shape; attends to redactional and theological coherence.
- **Progressive revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure unfolds historically; later texts interpret earlier promises.
- **Promise → Fulfillment**
 - Hermeneutical pattern used to trace major themes (e.g., Abrahamic promise → Christ).
- **Covenant(s)**
 - Central structuring category linking OT narrative and NT fulfillment; used to frame salvation-history.
- **Christocentrism**
 - Christ as interpretive key: OT and NT readings oriented to person and work of Jesus.
- **Typology**
 - Intratextual patterns where persons/events prefigure later fulfillment (not mere allegory).
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Thematic axis combining eschatology, kingship, and covenantal rule.
- **Unity and diversity of Scripture**
 - Tension acknowledged: one redemptive storyline with multiple theological perspectives.
- **Theological trajectory**
 - Term for mapping development of doctrine across scriptural history.
- **Hermeneutics**
 - Method emphasis: exegetical primacy, theological synthesis built on careful textual study.
- **Israel-Church relation**
 - Treatment that resists simple replacement or strict separations; explores continuity and discontinuity.
- **Promise/fulfillment language**
 - Frequent analytic idiom to articulate how NT interprets OT texts.
- **Typological and eschatological reading**
 - Intends to keep both historical rootedness and future consummation in view.

How the work is used:
- As a **definition source** for the aims, limits, and methods of biblical theology in evangelical contexts.
- As a **polemic** tool against abstractions that detach doctrines from Scripture's narrative flow.
- As an **exegetical model** and topical reference for tracing themes across OT-NT.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula to bridge exegesis and systematic theology.
