### TITLE
John Calvin's Doctrine of the Knowledge of God - T. H. L. Parker (study of John Calvin)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century historical-theological study engaging primary sources (Calvin's Institutes, commentaries, sermons) against backgrounds of Renaissance humanism, late medieval scholasticism, and Reformation polemics.
 - Addresses mid-century questions about natural theology, epistemology of faith, and Calvin's place between Augustine and later Reformed dogmatics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin articulates a twofold doctrine of knowledge of God: a limited, universal knowledge from creation and conscience (general revelation), and a saving, particular knowledge mediated by Scripture, Christ, and the Spirit (special revelation). Parker argues Calvin balances natural knowledge and the necessity of revelation without collapsing one into the other.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological reconstruction:
 - Survey of Calvin's sources (Augustine, Scripture, scholastic categories) and his critical appropriation.
 - Examination of key loci in Institutes (esp. I.1, I.3, I.11) and commentaries to map Calvin's epistemic vocabulary.
 - Analysis of the effects of sin on natural knowledge and the remedial role of Scripture and Spirit.
 - Doctrinal synthesis:
 - Definition and limits of the sensus divinitatis and natural theology.
 - The mechanics of saving knowledge: internal testimony of the Spirit, illumination, faith as assent+trust.
 - Relation of reason and revelation: reason not destroyed but enslaved and reoriented by grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Augustine, the Bible, medieval scholastics (via scholastic categories), Erasmus (humanist tension).
 - Secondary polemics: Roman Catholic claims to unaided reason; later critics such as Barth (implicitly via contrasts with 20th-century debates).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - General and special revelation (primary focus)
 - Noetic effects of sin / human depravity
 - Role of Scripture, Spirit, and faith (epistemology of salvation)
 - Implicit: Trinity (as object of saving knowledge), Christology (knowing God in Christ), soteriology (knowledge as salvific).

- **Closing line (calibrating the center of gravity)**
 - Calvin presents knowledge of God as rooted in creation but consummated only in the revelation of Christ and the Spirit's witness, thereby combining a credible natural theology with an uncompromising demand for redemptive revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong affirmation of a built-in "sensus divinitatis" that gives humans a universal, though defective, awareness of God.
 - Precision about the distinction between notional/not-saving knowledge and relational, saving knowledge of God in Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects radical naturalism by insisting that conscience and creation cannot yield saving knowledge due to corruption by sin.
 - Distinguishes himself from later anti-natural-theology reactions (e.g., Barth): Calvin does not altogether negate natural revelation but subordinates it to special revelation for salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of tripartite epistemic elements: notitia (knowledge), assensus (assent), fiducia (trust/faith) - clarifying cognitive and volitional dimensions of faith.
 - Integration of pastoral anthropology with epistemology: sin as an epistemic disorder requiring remedial revelation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Parker shows Calvin's model informed classical Reformed apologetics and natural theology debates; influenced twentieth-century Reformed responses to modernity.
 - Continues to be read as a corrective to caricatures of Calvin as pure fideist or rationalist.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a nuanced framework for contemporary disputes over natural theology, religious epistemology, and the role of Scripture and Spirit in knowing God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sensus divinitatis**
 - Innate faculty or imprint giving general awareness of God; real but darkened by sin.

- **General revelation**
 - Knowledge of God available in creation and conscience; sufficient for natural knowledge but not salvation.

- **Special revelation**
 - Christ-centered, Scriptural revelation mediated by the Spirit; necessary for saving knowledge.

- **Notitia / Assensus / Fiducia**
 - Calvinan threefold account of faith: intellectual knowledge (notitia), assent (assensus), trusting commitment (fiducia).

- **Noetic effects of sin**
 - The doctrine that sin distorts cognitive capacities so that natural knowledge is insufficient and often misleading.

- **Testimony / internal witness of the Spirit**
 - The Spirit's work making Scripture and Christ subjectively known and sealing faith; epistemic guarantor of saving knowledge.

- **Natural theology (Calvinian usage)**
 - Limited and provisional: yields moral obligation and general theistic conviction but must be subordinated to Scripture.

- **Saving vs. notional knowledge**
 - Contrast between mere intellectual awareness of God and relational, reconciled knowledge in Christ.

- **Illumination**
 - Spirit-enabled opening of mind and heart to perceive divine truth; not mere abstract enlightenment but grace-enabled reception.

- **Scripture as certifying norm**
 - Scripture functions as the authoritative, divinely sanctioned content that corrects and satisfies natural glimpses of God.

- **Faith as epistemic act**
 - For Calvin, faith is cognitive and volitional-knowing that + trusting in whom.

- **Acquaintance knowledge (knowing God personally)**
 - Emphatic in Calvin: ultimate aim of knowledge is personal communion, not merely propositional assent.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on general vs. special revelation and the sensus divinitatis.
 - As a **polemic tool** against both naive naturalism and radical fideism, supplying a balanced model for apologetics and theology.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: reading Calvin's Institutes and commentaries to ground doctrinal claims about revelation and faith.
