### TITLE
**God, Heaven and Har Magedon: A Covenantal Tale of Cosmos and Telos** - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-career synthesis (early 2000s) within conservative Reformed biblical theology.
 - Responds to dispensational literalism, theonomy/postmillennialism, and literalist readings of Genesis; advances covenantal-apocalyptic hermeneutics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture depicts the cosmos under covenant as a temple ordered to Sabbath consummation; history moves toward a climactic **Har Magedon** conflict that is symbolically the **mount of assembly** (har moed), not a geographic Mount Megiddo. Christ, the true temple-king, secures telos and brings heaven to earth.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Heaven and Temple**: Heaven is the archetypal sanctuary; Eden and Zion are ectypal replicas. The **Glory-Spirit** presence marks sacred space and sabbatical destiny.
 - **Covenant and Kingdom**: Adam under a probationary covenant of works; sanctions structure history. Intrusions of final judgment appear in holy war and theocracy.
 - **Apocalyptic Hermeneutics**: Prophetic de-creation language is covenantal-judicial, not astrophysical reportage; Revelation communicates by symbolic recapitulation.
 - **Har Magedon**: Exegetical case that Rev 16:16 evokes Isa 14:13 s mount of assembly (har moed), the cosmic Zion contested by the anti-god city. Final battle centers on lordship and worship, resolved by the Lamb.
 - **Christology and Soteriology**: The last Adam attains sabbath-rest by meritorious obedience; death-judgment falls on him proleptically; resurrection-ascension opens the heavenly temple.
 - **Church and Ethics**: The church is pilgrim-witness in a common-grace world; OT theocracy and herem are eschatological intrusions and non-normative for civil order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages ANE treaty and temple-mountain motifs; biblical interlocutors include Genesis 1-2; Isaiah 14; Ezekiel 28; Ezekiel 38-39; Zechariah; Revelation.
 - Dialogues critically with dispensational eschatology, theonomy (Bahnsen, Rushdoony), and literalist creationism; converges in part with Vosian biblical theology and later temple studies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics; creation and Sabbath; covenant of works/grace; republication at Sinai; common grace vs holy realm; Christ s active obedience; ecclesiology and holy war; eschatology and final judgment.
- **Closing line**
 - The book centers on this claim: the covenantal God enthrones his Christ on the cosmic mountain, translating heaven s temple glory into eschatological new creation through judgment and Sabbath consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Har Magedon = har moed**: symbolic mount of assembly, not Mount Megiddo; focuses the battle as liturgical-sovereign conflict.
 - **Glory-Spirit** as temple-defining theophany anchoring creation, exodus, Zion, and eschaton.
 - **Cosmos-as-temple** and **Sabbath telos** as the architecture of redemptive history.
 - **Intrusion ethics**: OT theocracy and herem as anticipations of final judgment, delimiting civil application today.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against **dispensational literalism**: opts for apocalyptic symbolism and recapitulation; denies geographic Armageddon and a millennial Israelite theocracy.
 - Against **theonomy/postmillennialism**: rejects a civil embedding of Mosaic penology; emphasizes common-grace order distinct from the holy realm.
 - Against **literalist cosmology**: advocates framework/upper-lower register reading of Genesis 1 and prophetic decreation.
- **Innovations**
 - Lexical-redemptive link between Rev 16 and Isa 14; sharpened temple-mountain synthesis; expanded use of ANE treaty and palace-temple ideology for covenant structure.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed circles for temple theology, apocalyptic hermeneutics, and two-kingdoms ethics; provoked debate with theonomists and dispensationalists; formative for later biblical-theological work on Revelation and temple.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a coherent covenantal frame uniting creation, cross, and consummation; models symbol-sensitive exegesis; clarifies church-state ethics; offers a durable guide to reading Revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glory-Spirit**: Theophanic Spirit-cloud marking God s royal presence; defines holy space from Eden to New Jerusalem.
- **Cosmic Temple**: Creation ordered as sanctuary; heaven archetype, earth replica; goal is Sabbath enthronement.
- **Sabbath Consummation**: Eschatological rest secured by the last Adam; structures sixth-to-seventh day teleology.
- **Covenant of Works (Adamic probation)**: Pre-fall arrangement with sanction of death; provides legal backdrop to Christ s obedience.
- **Republication (Mosaic)**: Sinaitic covenant re-enacts works principle typologically in Israel s land tenure and sanctions.
- **Intrusion Ethics**: Temporary intrusion of eschatological judgment in theocracy/holy war; non-transferrable to common civil realm.
- **Common Grace vs Holy Realm**: Dual ordering of history; church as holy embassy amid a restrained, non-theocratic world order.
- **Upper/Lower Register**: Hermeneutical pairing for Genesis and apocalyptic discourse, distinguishing archetypal heavenly realities from earthly replicas.
- **Prophetic De-creation Idiom**: Symbolic language for covenantal judgment (sun darkened, stars fall) rather than astronomical collapse.
- **Har Magedon (har moed)**: Mount of assembly; symbolic locus of eschatological clash between Zion and the anti-kingdom.
- **Recapitulation (Revelation)**: Cyclical visionary structure culminating repeatedly at judgment and victory of the Lamb.
- **Holy War (herem)**: Judicial devotion to destruction as typological foretaste of final judgment.
- **Temple-Mountain/Zion**: Convergence of throne, sanctuary, and city; axis of God s reign in history and eschaton.
- **Typology and Prolepsis**: Historical patterns that anticipate consummation; Christ and church realize the antitype.
- **Oath-Sanctions**: Covenant ratification and penalties; undergird soteriology and eschatology.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Eschatology**: Framework for reading Revelation and final judgment; Armageddon redefined.
 - **Covenant Theology**: Clarifies works/grace structure, republication, oath-sanctions.
 - **Soteriology/Christology**: Grounds active obedience and sabbath-rest in Adam-Christ typology.
 - **Bibliology/Hermeneutics**: Model of symbolic, temple-aware exegesis integrating ANE backgrounds.
