### TITLE
Israel and Hermeneutics (on Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church) - Craig A. Blaising

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical context; emergence of *progressive dispensationalism* as a corrective to both classical dispensationalism and some strands of covenant theology.
 - Conversation situated within debates over hermeneutics, the status of biblical promises to Israel, and the relationship between Israel and the Church; interacts with the growing interest in canonical and redemptive-historical approaches.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hermeneutical principles determine whether Israel's promises are regarded as permanently national and future, fully transferred to the Church, or fulfilled progressively in Christ. Blaising argues for a canonical-historical hermeneutic that affirms both continuity and distinction: the Church participates in but does not exhaust Israel's national promises; ethnic Israel retains a future in God's program.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Articulate a hermeneutic that is literal-grammatical-historical but *canonical* in outlook (reading promises in the trajectory of redemptive history).
 - Introduce *progressive fulfillment*: promises to Israel find their initial and partial fulfillment in Christ and the Church, with final, national consummation still future for ethnic Israel.
 - Exegetical treatment of key texts (notably Romans 9-11) to show:
 - Paul's doctrine of election and remnant preserves Israel's corporate status.
 - Gentile inclusion is real (grafting metaphor) but does not nullify the distinct future of Israel.
 - Draw implications for covenant theology, ecclesiology, and eschatology: both continuity (one redemptive story) and discontinuity (distinct covenantal promises and future for Israel).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical dispensationalists (e.g., John Walvoord, Charles Ryrie) and covenant theologians (representative voices such as Geerhardus Vos, John Murray) while dialoguing with broader evangelical scholarship on Romans and canon.
 - Dialogues with contemporary canonical/redemptive-historical interpreters (implicit interlocutors include scholars emphasizing typology and fulfillment).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Hermeneutics, covenant theology (Abrahamic, Davidic, New Covenant), election, ecclesiology (nature of the Church), eschatology (Israel's future), Christology (Messianic fulfillment), typology and promise-fulfillment.
- **Closing line**
 - Blaising's theological center of gravity: a *canonical, progressivist hermeneutic* that upholds both the Church's present participation in redemptive promises and the continuing, future role of ethnic Israel in God's consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses *progressive fulfillment* as a middle path: promises are inaugurated in Christ and the Church yet retain future national aspects for Israel.
 - Emphasizes a *canonical-historical* method that reads individual texts within the Bible's unfolding storyline rather than treating promises as either fully transferred or permanently deferred.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical dispensationalism's sharp bifurcation (which isolates Israel and Church excessively) by showing real theological and salvific continuity.
 - Corrects some covenant theology tendencies that effectively erase national Israel by subsuming all promises into the Church (i.e., repudiates replacement theology).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the language of "progressive fulfillment" within dispensational hermeneutics and clarifies the use of typology and promise as complementary explanatory tools.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within evangelical and dispensational circles; central to the progressive dispensational movement and widely cited in discussions of Romans 9-11 and Israel-Church relations.
 - Provoked critique from both classical dispensationalists (for conceding continuity) and some covenant theologians (for retaining distinct future for Israel).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating literal-historical exegesis with canonical theology; valuable for courses on eschatology, hermeneutics, and Pauline theology; a durable corrective to polarizing positions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canonical-historical hermeneutic** - reading texts in the trajectory of redemptive history; central method.
- **Progressive fulfillment** - promises are initiated in Christ/the Church and consummated later for Israel.
- **Literal-grammatical-historical interpretation (modified)** - retains literal meaning but read within canonical development.
- **Continuity and discontinuity** - twin poles: theological unity of God's plan vs. distinct roles for Israel and Church.
- **Promise-fulfillment** - promises as stages (inaugurated, advancing, consummated).
- **Typology** - typological relations used to show real but partial fulfillment in the Church.
- **Remnant** - corporate Israel maintained through election and faithful minority (Romans 11 motif).
- **Grafting (Romans 11)** - metaphor for Gentile insertion into olive tree; signifies inclusion without erasing original stock.
- **People of God (two-fold sense)** - Israel as covenant nation; Church as people who participate in promises.
- **National Israel's future** - affirmation of a literal, corporate restoration or future for ethnic Israel.
- **Covenants (Abrahamic/Davidic/New Covenant)** - treated as promise-frames with ongoing relevance for Israel's future.
- **Already/not-yet** - eschatological framing for present participation and future consummation.
- **Election** - corporate and covenantal, tied to God's faithful program.
- **Fulfillment(s)** - distinguished between initial/inaugurated fulfillment and final consummative fulfillment.

How this work is used:
- As a definitional source for the *progressive dispensational* hermeneutic.
- As a polemical resource against both replacement theology and unqualified classical dispensational separations.
- As an exegetical model for Romans 9-11 and for teaching the theological status of Israel and the Church in systematic and biblical-theological courses.
