### TITLE
**Christian Baptism** by John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Westminster Theological Seminary; Orthodox Presbyterian Church; confessional Reformed milieu responding to American evangelical credobaptism and sacramental misunderstandings.
 - Engages Scripture with Old Princeton/Westminster method; aligns with Westminster Standards.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Baptism is a **divinely instituted sign and seal** of the covenant of grace, administered to believers and their children; it is a **means of grace** truly efficacious by the **Word and Spirit**, yet not mechanically regenerative; no single **mode** is biblically mandated.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Institution and **Trinitarian name**: Baptism in the one Name (Matt 28:19) under the authority of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
 - Nature and efficacy: Sacrament as **sign and seal** confirming union with Christ; efficacy depends on the **Spirit** and faith, not ex opere operato.
 - Subjects: **Covenantal continuity** from Abraham; the promise to believers and their **children** (Gen 17; Acts 2:39); households; holiness of children (1 Cor 7:14).
 - Mode and meaning: **Washing/purification** idiom in Scripture permits immersion, pouring, sprinkling; Rom 6 imagery is soteriological union, not a mode prescription.
 - Distinction: **Spirit-baptism** and water-baptism related but not identical; the Spirit is a **divine person** who indwells and applies redemption.
 - Ecclesial order: Baptism admits to the **visible church**; relation to the **Lord's Supper** (profession required; Table fenced).
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Calvin, Westminster Confession/Catechisms; Old Princeton (Hodge, Warfield); Vosian redemptive-historical sensitivity.
 - Interlocutors: Baptist/Anabaptist restriction of the sign; Roman Catholic and Lutheran accounts of baptismal efficacy; appeal to **ecumenical creeds** for Trinitarian grounding.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation & hermeneutics** (covenantal continuity); **Trinity** (ontological/economic; filioque in the background of mission); **Pneumatology** (person and deity of the Spirit; regeneration/indwelling); **Soteriology** (union with Christ, effectual calling); **Ecclesiology & Sacraments** (means of grace; Supper).
- **Center of gravity**
 - Baptism is God's covenantal act of **naming and claiming** a people in Christ, by the **Spirit**, through the **Word**, within the visible church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust **covenant-of-grace continuity** grounding infant baptism without collapsing new/old economies.
 - Tight **Word-Spirit-sacrament** coordination: baptism confirms what the Word proclaims and the Spirit applies.
 - Careful semantic and biblical-theological case that **mode is adiaphoron**; OT washings and NT language favor flexibility.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against credobaptism: critiques narrowing the covenant to conscious believers; insists children are federally included.
 - Against sacramentalism: denies **ex opere operato**; grace is not tied to the moment or the sign apart from the Spirit.
 - Against over-symbolization: baptism is not a mere badge but a **means of grace** with real efficacy to the elect.
 - Clarifies Rom 6/Col 2:12 as union-with-Christ texts, not immersion mandates.
- **Conceptual clarifications**
 - Distinguishes **Spirit-baptism** (eschatological gift, personal indwelling) from the rite while maintaining their covenantal nexus.
 - Links the **Trinitarian formula** to the missions/processions (filioque implicitly) to root baptism in the triune life.
- **Reception / influence**
 - Standard Reformed paedobaptist apologetic in OPC/Presbyterian circles; widely assigned in seminary catechetics and ecclesiology.
 - Models irenic yet firm engagement with Baptists and with Roman Catholic/Lutheran views of efficacy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable **exegetical template**; catechetical clarity; pastoral guidance on church membership, family discipleship, and Table admission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign and seal**: Visible sign that seals God's promise to believers and their children; confirms union, forgiveness, adoption.
- **Covenant of grace**: One redemptive covenant across administrations; grounds continuity of the sign from circumcision to baptism.
- **Administration of the covenant**: God's ordered means (Word, sacraments) by which covenant benefits are dispensed.
- **Household principle**: Federal headship extends the sign to children; household baptisms witness this norm.
- **Means of grace**: Ordained instruments (preaching, baptism, Supper, prayer) through which the Spirit works faith and growth.
- **Union with Christ**: Baptism signifies and seals incorporation into Christ's death and resurrection; Rom 6 as theological reality, not mode.
- **Spirit-baptism vs water-baptism**:
 - Spirit-baptism: personal, sovereign bestowal of the Spirit; inaugurates new-covenant life.
 - Water-baptism: covenantal rite; related to, but not identical with, the Spirit's indwelling.
- **Trinitarian name**: Baptism into the one Name (Matt 28:19); reflects ontological Trinity and economic missions (filioque background).
- **Efficacy (not ex opere operato)**: Real grace to the elect in God's time; inseparable from faith and the Spirit's operation.
- **Mode (immersion/affusion/aspersion)**: Biblically permissible variety; OT washings and NT usage undermine mode absolutism.
- **Regeneration and indwelling**: Work of the **Holy Spirit**, a divine person; baptism does not mechanically regenerate.
- **Visible/invisible church**: Baptism admits to the visible community; saving union belongs to the invisible church of the elect.
- **Fencing and admission to the Table**: Baptism precedes the Supper; communicant admission requires credible profession.
- **Ecumenical creeds / filioque**: Creedal Trinitarianism frames the rite; Western confession of the Spirit's procession correlates with mission in baptism.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for sacrament, sign/seal, and subjects in ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** in paedobaptist vs credobaptist debates and against ex opere operato views.
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenantal continuity and sacramental texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinity, pneumatology, soteriology, and church practice (baptism-Supper order).
