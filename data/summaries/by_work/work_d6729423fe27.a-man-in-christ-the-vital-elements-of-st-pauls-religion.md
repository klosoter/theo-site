### TITLE
**A Man in Christ: The Vital Elements of St. Paul's Religion** - James S. Stewart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Scottish Presbyterian milieu; written during the upheavals of the WWII era and the renewed pastoral-theological interest in the existential meaning of doctrine.
 - Situated between confessional Reformed theology, pastoral ministry, and emergent New Testament scholarship; addresses both academic and pulpit audiences.
- **Central thesis**
 - St. Paul's religion is centered and structured by the real, constitutive **union of the believer with Christ**. Christian identity, ethics, suffering, hope, and worship are grounded primarily in being "in Christ" rather than in mere legal acquittal or moralism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close reading of Pauline phrases and motifs (e.g., "in Christ," "with Christ," baptismal language) to establish union as Paul's controlling metaphor.
 - Theological synthesis: union with Christ explains justification, sanctification, suffering, hope, and ecclesial life - the Christian life is participation in Christ's death and resurrection effected by the Spirit.
 - Pastoral application: implications for Christian experience, discipleship, pastoral care, and worship - union transforms identity and produces ethical fruit without reducing salvation to ethics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament exegesis and classical Reformation categories (Luther/Calvin implicit), critiques reductionist liberal and moralistic readings of Paul, and positions itself against readings that make justification purely forensic.
 - Dialogue with contemporary Pauline scholarship and pastoral theology; less systematic engagement with modern dogmatics but a tacit corrective to purely legal models.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (Christ as the center of personal identity), **Spirit** (agent of incorporation), **justification** and **sanctification** (rearticulated via participation), **soteriology** (participatory), **ecclesiology** (church as corpus Christi), **sacramental theology** (baptism as symbolic/real participation), **eschatology** (already-and-not-yet realized union).
- **Closing line**
 - The heart of Paul's religion is a participatory ontology: the believer is a new kind of person because he or she is a man (or woman) **in Christ**, united by the Spirit into the same death, life, and destiny as the risen Lord.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats union with Christ as the *central* theological and existential category - not merely one doctrine among others but the lens that reinterprets justification, sanctification, and hope.
 - Strong pastoral-existential tone: doctrine is presented as life-changing identity rather than abstract dogma.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects purely forensic or legal models of Paul by showing how justification is grounded in ontological union rather than only in courtroom imagery.
 - Opposes liberal ethical readings that reduce Paul to a moral teacher; shows ethics as the fruit, not the root, of union.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Recasts Pauline language of "in/with Christ" into anthropological categories ("a man in Christ")-making theological identity the pivot for doctrine and practice.
 - Emphasizes participation (koinonia/ sharing) as the operative term linking Spirit, sacrament, and life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in mid-20th-century pastoral and evangelical circles; contributed to renewed attention to union theology in preaching and devotional theology.
 - Cited by later Reformed and evangelical writers as a pastoral complement to scholarly Pauline studies; shaped devotional expositions on baptism and Christian identity.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model of how to read Paul devotionally and theologically without collapsing into sentimentality; useful for pastors, homileticians, and theologians seeking a theology of identity rooted in Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"In Christ" / "Union with Christ"**
 - Central motif; denotes constitutive, participatory relation making Christ the believer's ontological center.
- **Participation (koinonia)**
 - Shared life with Christ; the structural bridge between Spirit, sacrament, and ethical transformation.
- **Incorporation**
 - The Spirit's work by which believers are joined to Christ as members of his body.
- **Baptism**
 - Interpreted sacramentally as the locus and sign of participation in Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Death and Resurrection**
 - The formative pattern of Christian identity: believers are co-crucified and co-raised with Christ.
- **New man / Old man**
 - Anthropological categories indicating the qualitative change that union effects in identity and practice.
- **Spirit**
 - The active agent effecting and sustaining union; not an addendum but intrinsic to participation.
- **Justification (recast)**
 - Read through participation: legal declaration coheres with and flows from being in Christ, not in competition with it.
- **Sanctification**
 - Fruit of union; ethical transformation is relational and participatory rather than primarily moral achievement.
- **Ecclesiology (body of Christ)**
 - Church as the corporate expression of individual unions: communal and sacramental embodiment of union.
- **Eschatology (already/not-yet)**
 - Union situates believers in Christ's inaugurated eschatological life; present reality with future consummation.
- **Identity**
 - The theological anthropology of Stewart: persons become who they are through relational union with Christ.
- **Mystical union**
 - Descriptive term for the inward and existential dimension of union without divorcing it from objective Christological realities.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary treatments of "union with Christ" in systematic and pastoral theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline "in Christ" language devotionally and theologically.
 - As a **pastoral/pedagogical resource** for preaching, spiritual formation, and sacramental theology - a corrective to forensic- or moralism-dominated emphases.
