### TITLE
The Lord's Supper in the Reformed Tradition - Herman Selderhuis

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Modern historical-theological study by a Reformed church historian situating Eucharistic doctrine across the Reformation and post-Reformation eras.
 - Engages primary sources (Reformers, confessions, liturgies) and secondary scholarship in Reformed, Lutheran, and Roman Catholic debates.
 - Addresses both intellectual theology and pastoral/ liturgical practice within Protestant confessions (continental Reformed and British Puritan/WCF streams).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformed tradition articulates a distinct Eucharistic theology: neither Roman corporal presence nor Lutheran sacramental union, but a **covenantal, spiritual presence** in which the Supper functions as a sign and seal of Christ's benefits received by faith and administered within the believing community and church order.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical tracing: early Reformation controversies (Zwingli, Bucer, Calvin) → consolidation in Reformed confessions → seventeenth-century orthodoxy and pastoral theology → later liturgical variations and contemporary reception.
 - Theological analysis: ontology of the sacrament (presence vs. sign), Christology (ascension and heavenly session as basis for presence), pneumatology (Spirit as mediator of sacramental effect), covenant theology (supper as covenant sign/seal).
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: admission to the table, discipline, catechesis, liturgical forms and frequency.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Huldrych Zwingli, Martin Bucer, John Calvin, Heinrich Bullinger, theologians of the Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession, Westminster Confession.
 - Interlocutors: Lutheran theologians (contrast over presence), Roman Catholic sacramental theology, Anabaptist/Radical Reformation views.
 - Sources: confessions, catechisms, liturgical manuals, sermons and polemical exchanges.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology (nature, means, efficacy)
 - Covenant theology (sign, seal, covenantal reception)
 - Christology (presence, ascension, benefits)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit's role in uniting believers to Christ)
 - Ecclesiology (table as visible mark of the covenant community; discipline)
 - Soteriology (faith as instrument of appropriation; assurance)

- **Closing line**
 - Selderhuis shows the Reformed Lord's Supper to be a theologically coherent, covenantal, and pastoral doctrine: a spiritually efficacious sign-seal that binds Word, Spirit, and church discipline to the reception of Christ's benefits by faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong articulation of the Supper as **sign and seal within covenantal structure** rather than merely memorial or physical presence.
 - Persistent attention to pastoral practice: catechesis, admission, pastoral care, and liturgical form as theological loci.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Clarifies and corrects caricatures: rejects both a simplistic "memorialist" label for Calvin and the Lutheran identification of a physical or local presence.
 - Shows intra-Reformed diversity (Zwingli vs Calvin vs later orthodox formulations) rather than a monolithic position.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes phraseology like **"real spiritual presence"** and frames the sacrament as an **instrumental means** mediated by Word and Spirit rather than by physical contact.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformation studies and by pastors seeking historically grounded sacramental theology.
 - Valued in ecumenical conversations for clarifying Reformed positions vis-a-vis Lutheran and Roman Catholic claims.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced historical-theological model linking confessional documents to pastoral practice; useful for teaching, liturgical renewal, and ecumenical clarification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign and Seal** - Sacrament functions as visible sign and divine seal of covenant promises; seals the believer's faith and assurance.
- **Spiritual Presence / Real Spiritual Presence** - Christ is truly present by the Spirit to believers, not locally in the elements.
- **Memorialism (contrast)** - The position emphasizing remembrance; Selderhuis nuances and often rejects simplistic memorialist readings of Reformed authors.
- **Sacramental Efficacy / Means of Grace** - Communion as an instrumental means by which the Spirit communicates Christ's benefits when received in faith.
- **Word-Sacrament Union** - The efficacy of the Supper depends on its union with the preached Word and Spirit; the Word frames the sacrament.
- **Covenant Theology** - Framework that interprets the Supper as a covenant sign/seal tied to promises, membership, and discipline.
- **Ecclesial Discipline / Admission to the Table** - Table access governed by catechesis and discipline; the community safeguards the sacrament's integrity.
- **Ascension/Heavenly Session** - Christ's bodily ascension is the ground for non-local, spiritual presence at the Supper.
- **Heidelberg/Belgic/WCF Formulations** - Confessional summaries that systematize Reformed sacrament doctrine; used by Selderhuis to show doctrinal consolidation.
- **Anabaptist and Lutheran Contrasts** - Highlights differences with Radical Reformation (varied views on sacraments) and Lutheran sacramental union.
- **Benefit (beneficia Christi)** - The spiritual gifts communicated in the Supper: forgiveness, union, strengthening of faith.
- **Memorial vs. Efficacious Sign** - Distinction that avoids reducing the Supper to mere remembrance or elevating it to corporal presence.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise historical-definition source for what "Reformed" sacrament theology has meant across confessions.
 - As a polemical and clarifying resource in Eucharistic debates (ecumenical and intra-Protestant).
 - As an exegetical-pastoral model linking confessional formulations to liturgical practice and church discipline.
