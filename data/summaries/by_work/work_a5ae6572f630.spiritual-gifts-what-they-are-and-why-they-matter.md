### TITLE
**Spiritual Gifts: What They Are and Why They Matter - Thomas R. Schreiner**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed context (early 21st century). A pastorally oriented, academically informed treatment aimed at churches and students rather than purely technical scholarship.
 - Engages debates heightened by Pentecostal/charismatic renewal and ongoing cessationist/continuationist controversy within conservative Protestantism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Spiritual gifts are God-given, Spirit-wrought capacities for ministry intended to build the church and advance Christ's mission; careful biblical exposition is required to sort normative practice from cultural or experiential excess.
 - The work addresses: Which gifts are normative today? How are gifts related to offices (apostle, prophet, pastor-teacher)? What are pastoral and ecclesial implications for order, unity, and mission?

- **Core argument or structure**
 - exegetical foundation: systematic exposition of key Pauline texts (Romans 12; 1 Corinthians 12-14; Ephesians 4; 1 Peter 4).
 - theological synthesis: locates gifts within a Trinitarian frame (Spirit as giver, Christ as head, Father as sovereign).
 - pastoral application: guidance for discernment, use of gifts in worship, and safeguards against abuses.
 - typical moves:
 - Define charismata and distinguish gift-types (service/administrative vs sign/prophetic).
 - Trace distribution and purpose (unity, edification, mission).
 - Discuss relationship of gifts to office and to Scripture's authority.
 - Offer constructive pastoral norms for contemporary churches.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary biblical interlocutors: Paul (esp. 1 Cor., Rom. 12, Eph. 4), Luke/Acts for historical instances, NT wisdom on prophecy and tongues.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: mainstream evangelical scholars across cessationist/continuationist lines (e.g., Grudem, Fee, MacArthur implicitly or explicitly), historical tradition (early church, Reformers) for doctrinal continuity.
 - Practical engagement with Pentecostal and charismatic practices and critiques.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (primary): origin, distribution, and purpose of gifts.
 - **Ecclesiology**: gifts for the church's unity, order, and mission.
 - **Revelation/authority**: relation of charismatic utterances to Scripture and doctrinal normativity.
 - Secondary: sanctification, ministry offices, and occasional Christology (headship of Christ over gifts).

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner centers the doctrine of spiritual gifts on the Spirit-given diversity that serves Christ's one body, arguing for discerned continuation of gifts under Scripture's normative authority and for their ordered use toward edification and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balances affirmation of present gifting with robust insistence on Scripture's final authority; neither uncritical charismatic affirmation nor classical cessationist denial.
 - Strong pastoral insistence that gifts must be exercised for *edification* and *order* (echoing Paul) rather than spectacle or personal status.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects excesses of some charismatic practice by stressing biblical criteria for prophecy and the need for interpretation and testing.
 - Distinguishes sharply between *office* (e.g., apostle) and *gift* (charismata), resisting contemporary tendencies to identify offices with charismatic manifestations.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines tri-partite contrasts (sign vs service vs revelation gifts) with attention to purpose and continuity.
 - Emphasizes a Trinitarian grammar: Father's plan, Son's headship, Spirit's distribution.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a balanced, pastoral primer; appreciated for clear exegesis and practical application.
 - Cited in both continuationist and cautious-charismatic conversations as a moderating voice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between NT exegesis and parish practice; valuable for preaching, pastoral training, and classroom surveys of pneumatology and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Charismata (spiritual gifts)** - God-given abilities the Spirit grants for ministry; central lexical term.
- **Sign gifts** - Gifts often tied to authentication (healings, miracles); discussed regarding their historic and present role.
- **Service (or ministry) gifts** - Gifts for practical service and leadership (helps, administration, teaching); emphasized as perennial.
- **Prophecy** - Distinguished into biblical prophecy vs. contemporary prophetic utterance; criteria for testing and submission outlined.
- **Tongues and interpretation** - Treated with careful exegesis of 1 Corinthians 14; emphasis on intelligibility and edification.
- **Apostolic/Foundational gifts** - Discussed as historically foundational for the church; implications for contemporary apostolic claims examined.
- **Distribution (sovereign gifting)** - The Spirit's discretionary giving; counters vocational or merit-based views of ministry.
- **Edification** - Primary telos of gifts; normative criterion for legitimate exercise.
- **Order and decency** - Pauline standard applied to worship and public use of gifts.
- **Scriptural authority** - Bench for evaluating charismatic claims; revelation does not supplant canonical Scripture.
- **Discernment/testing** - Practical norms for churches to evaluate prophetic claims and public ministry.
- **Trinitarian ordering** - Gifts located within Father/Son/Spirit economy.
- **Continuationism vs. Cessationism** - Schreiner leans toward cautious continuation, affirming ongoing gifts but rejecting unbounded charismatic claims.
- **Office vs. Gift** - Clarifies that possession of a gift does not automatically establish ecclesial office.

- How this work is used across loci
 - As a **definition source** for courses on pneumatology and ecclesiology: concise, accessible definitions and typologies.
 - As a **moderating polemic**: measured critique of extremes on both cessationist and charismatic sides.
 - As an **exegetical model**: careful Pauline exegesis applied to pastoral questions about worship, prophecy, and gifts.
 - As a **practical guide** for pastors/elders in forming policies for public worship, gift-testing, and ministry deployment.
