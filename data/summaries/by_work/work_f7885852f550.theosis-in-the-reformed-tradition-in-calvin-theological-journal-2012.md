### TITLE
**Theosis in the Reformed Tradition** - William B. Evans, Calvin Theological Journal (2012)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within a Reformed scholarly venue (Calvin Theological Journal, 2012) amid renewed ecumenical interest in theosis and cross‑tradition retrieval of patristic theology.
 - Addresses contemporary Protestant hesitancy toward "theosis" by surveying historical Reformed commitments and recent scholarship that reclaims deifying language.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evans argues that a qualified form of theosis (participation in the divine life) is both present and theologically intelligible within the Reformed tradition when reframed by its commitments to union with Christ and Pneumatology - yet distinct from Eastern Orthodox ontological accounts of deification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey: traces terminological and theological loci where Reformed writers speak of participation in the divine nature.
 - Theological analysis: explicates how **union with Christ** and the **Holy Spirit's indwelling** function as the locus of participation in Reformed soteriology.
 - Polemical clarification: contrasts Reformed emphases (forensic justification, imputation, covenantal union) with Eastern "essence/energies" vocabulary to delineate legitimate overlap and crucial boundaries.
 - Constructive proposal: recommends cautious retrieval of theosis language to enrich Reformed pneumatology and spiritual formation without collapsing forensic categories.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Reformed classic voices (especially Calvin and Puritan writers) and Reformed scholastic tendencies; modern Reformed retrievalists.
 - Ecumenical interlocutor: Eastern Orthodox theology (as foil for explaining differences), plus patristic citations (e.g., "partakers of the divine nature" scriptural witness).
 - Scripture loci emphasized: Pauline union texts and 2 Peter 1:4.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit as agent of participation and union)
 - **Union with Christ** (ontological/relational participation)
 - **Soteriology** (justification, sanctification, adoption, glorification)
 - **Christology** (mediatorial role enabling human participation)
 - **Anthropology** (restoration of the imago Dei)
 - Secondary engagement: covenant theology and eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - The Reformed ­theological center of gravity on theosis: **participation in the divine life through the Spirit‑wrought union with Christ, held within a framework of justification and adoption, not ontological assimilation to divine essence.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Frames theosis primarily as a soteriological and relational category grounded in **union with Christ** and the **indwelling Spirit**, rather than metaphysical divinization.
 - Emphasizes continuity between imputed/forensic righteousness and real transformative participation - a synergistic account that retains forensic categories.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Eastern readings that equate Reformed caution with denial; instead, Reformed texts often affirm "partakers of the divine nature" with different metaphysical commitments.
 - Counters caricatures that Reformed theology reduces sanctification to moralism by showing robust pneumatological and mystical components.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocates reintroducing "theosis" language into Reformed parlance as a **heuristic** - carefully qualified by terms like "participation," "conformity," and "communion."

- **Reception and influence**
 - Serves as a scholarly bridge in ecumenical conversations and in intra‑Reformed debates about retrieval of patristic categories; useful to pastors and theologians seeking a vocabulary for sanctification that resonates with classical Christianity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise corrective to both Reformed neglect and Eastern overreading; valuable for teaching pneumatology, union with Christ, and pastoral theology of sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theosis / Deification**
 - Reformed reappropriation: participation in divine life without ontological assimilation to God's essence.

- **Participation (methexis)**
 - Core relational concept: believers partake in Christ's life, enabled by the Spirit.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Central locus: mystical‑real union that grounds justification, sanctification, and glorification.

- **Indwelling Holy Spirit**
 - Agent of participation, renewal of the image, and communion with the triune God.

- **Imputation vs. Infusion**
 - Imputation: forensic declaration (justification).
 - Infusion/participation: sanctifying reality by which believers truly share in Christ's life.

- **Partakers of the Divine Nature (2 Peter 1:4)**
 - Scriptural warrant that Reformed theology affirms, read through covenantal and Christological lenses.

- **Conformity to Christ**
 - Teleological expression of theosis in Reformed ethics and sanctification.

- **Adoption**
 - Legal and relational status enabling filial participation in divine life.

- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive renewal by the Spirit as the practical outworking of theosis.

- **Glorification**
 - Eschatological consummation of participation; final participation in divine life.

- **Forensic justification**
 - Keeps the Reformed boundary: participation does not negate declared righteousness as the basis of reconciliation.

- **Essence/Energies distinction**
 - Eastern technical vocabulary used as a contrast to clarify Reformed metaphysical reservations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source**: supplies a measured Reformed definition of theosis for teaching and ecumenical dialogue.
- As a **polemic**: corrects mischaracterizations (both Protestant denials and Eastern readings) and defends a Reformed retrieval.
- As an **exegetical model**: offers a hermeneutic for Pauline and Petrine texts that links union with Christ, pneumatology, and participation.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: facilitates theological integration of sanctification, pneumatology, and soteriology in Reformed curricula.
