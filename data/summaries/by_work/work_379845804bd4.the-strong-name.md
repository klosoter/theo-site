### TITLE
The Strong Name - James S. Stewart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Scottish Presbyterian context; Stewart as pastor-theologian and preacher aiming to recover a vital, pastoral theology for the church.
 - Reaction to both dry scholastic formulations and abstractions of modern theology; bridging Reformed confessionalism and personal Christian experience.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel must be grasped as a living union with Christ centered on the power of Christ's **name** - not merely an abstract doctrine of justification but an incorporated, formative reality that shapes identity, obedience, and assurance.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Scripture texts that show believers are united to Christ by name and person.
 - Theological synthesis: union with Christ grounds justification, adoption, sanctification, and assurance.
 - Pastoral application: how preaching, prayer, sacraments, and discipline foster appropriation of that union.
 - Practical implications for Christian courage, witness, and holiness derived from life in the "strong name."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy use of Scripture as primary authority.
 - Conversant with the Reformed tradition (confessional assumptions implied) and with contemporary pastoral theology; implicitly contrasts with purely forensic or merely ethical readings of the gospel.
 - Dialogues implicitly with modern existentialist concerns about authenticity and with technical theologians who separate objective and subjective aspects of salvation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Union with Christ** (primary focus)
 - Christology (person and saving name of Jesus)
 - Justification and adoption (as benefits rooted in union)
 - Sanctification and Christian life (participation and obedience)
 - Sacramental theology and means of grace (as vehicles for realizing union)
 - Pastoral theology (preaching, pastoral care, assurance)

- **Closing line**
 - The work's theological center: the believer's life is secured and shaped in the personal, participatory reality of being held in Christ's "strong name" - a union that is simultaneously objective (Christ's act) and existentially received (faith, means of grace).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses the image of Christ's "name" as theological shorthand for his personal authority, presence, and saving power - a relational, active concept rather than merely titular.
 - Strong pastoral-practical stress: doctrine must translate into the believer's lived appropriation of union.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against accounts of salvation confined to forensic declaration; insists on incorporation and ongoing participation.
 - Counters purely experiential mysticism by anchoring experience in Christ's objective work and name.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Strong Name" functions as a compact theological motif that unites Christological authority, salvific efficacy, and pastoral assurance.
 - Treats union with Christ in language accessible to homiletics without losing doctrinal precision.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among pastors and preachers in Reformed and broader evangelical circles for renewing emphasis on personal union.
 - Less treated in highly technical academic theology but regularly cited in pastoral theology, homiletics, and popular theological works dealing with Christian identity and assurance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for integrating doctrine and devotion.
 - Valuable in preaching, pastoral counseling, and courses on union with Christ because of clarity, pastoral immediacy, and theological balance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central category; union conceived as grounding all benefits (justification, adoption, sanctification) and as an enacted personal relationship.
- **Strong Name**
 - Name as locus of authority, presence, and saving power; shorthand for Christ's encompassing influence on believer's life.
- **Incorporation**
 - The act by which believers are joined to Christ; both forensic and participatory in Stewart's account.
- **Identification**
 - Ethical and existential results of union: believers identified with Christ in death, resurrection, and obedience.
- **Justification**
 - Treated as assured by union rather than isolated forensic verdict; justification rests on Christ's person and work.
- **Adoption**
 - Family status flowing from union; assurance and filial response to God's fatherhood.
- **Participation**
 - The believer's ongoing sharing in Christ's life (spiritual communion, growth).
- **Means of grace**
 - Preaching, sacraments, prayer as conduits for entering more deeply into the "strong name."
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in the objective reality of union and experienced through appropriation in faith and means of grace.
- **Sanctification / Obedience**
 - Fruit of union; moral transformation traced to lived incorporation in Christ.
- **Presence**
 - Emphasis on Christ's abiding presence with believers by name; counters abstraction.
- **Preaching**
 - Central pastoral medium for mediating union; Stewart models doctrinal preaching that forms identity.
- **Trust / Confidence**
 - Disposition produced by confidence in Christ's name; key pastoral aim.
- **Personal encounter**
 - Not sentimental experience but true appropriation of union through faith.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Pastoral resource: model for preaching and counseling on identity, assurance, and spiritual growth.
 - Doctrinal pivot: used to reframe debates about justification vs. sanctification by rooting both in union with Christ.
 - Exegetical/homiletical model: exemplar for tying biblical exposition to lived appropriation of gospel realities.
