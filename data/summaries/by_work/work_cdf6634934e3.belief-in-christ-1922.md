### TITLE
**Belief in Christ** (1922) - Charles Gore

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Post-World War I Anglican theology; Anglo-Catholic reception of modern historical-critical scholarship; ongoing 19th-early 20th century debates about the Incarnation and the "kenosis" (self-emptying) formulation emerging from continental Protestant theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Gore defends a classical Christology that preserves the full deity and true humanity of Christ while explaining the meaning of the Son's "self-emptying." The doctrinal problem is how to understand kenosis without reducing the eternal deity of the Son or making the Incarnation a temporary forfeiture of essential divine attributes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Statement of what it means to "believe in Christ": personal trust in the incarnate Son as revealer and Redeemer, not merely assent to propositions.
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic and Chalcedonian categories as the necessary framework for legitimate reflection.
 - Critique of radical kenotic interpretations that posit actual loss or suspension of divine attributes.
 - Proposal of a moderated kenotic schema: voluntary self-limitation in the mode of God's activity in the Incarnation, intelligible within the hypostatic union and Chalcedonian distinction.
 - Practical-theological consequences: how belief in Christ is grounded in the unified work of God and how this secures atonement, revelation, and ongoing mediation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit appeals to patristic authorities (Athanasius, Augustine) and to the Chalcedonian formula.
 - Engagement with 19th-century and contemporary kenotic theologians in Germany and with modern critics who sought to reconcile divine transcendence and historical humanity.
 - Anglican readers and clergy as primary audience; dialogue with liberal-critical currents of the era.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union), Trinity (relation of the Son to the Father), Incarnation, kenosis (humiliation and self-limitation), atonement (union as basis of redemption), revelation, and faith (the nature of belief in Christ).
- **Closing line:** Gore locates the heart of "belief in Christ" in a Chalcedonian Christology that affirms a voluntary divine self-limitation in the Incarnation-sufficient to explain Christ's true humanity and redemptive work, but not so construed as to compromise the Son's eternal deity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses belief as relational and existential trust grounded in the personal reality of the Incarnation rather than as mere doctrinal assent.
 - Advocates a constrained kenotic language: God's "emptying" is real in terms of mode of operation and voluntary condescension, but not an ontological subtraction from deity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects radical kenotic proposals that make the Son's deity contingent or temporally diminished.
 - Contrasts with theological liberalisms that over-psychologize Christ's humanity or underplay the metaphysical implications of Chalcedon.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies distinction between "limitation of operation" and "loss of attributes," proposing consistent vocabulary for Anglican discourse on kenosis.
 - Reorients discussion of belief toward incarnation-grounded trust rather than propositional minimalism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Read as a cautious Anglican corrective to speculative kenotic theology; appreciated in Anglo-Catholic circles for balance between tradition and modern inquiry.
 - Provided resource for later Anglican and ecumenical treatments wanting to affirm both divine impassibility and genuine human experience in Christ.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a clear exemplar of how to integrate patristic-Chalcedonian commitments with modern theological questions about divine action and human consciousness.
 - Useful in teaching Christology where kenosis figures prominently, offering measured critique without dismissing the theological insight behind kenotic language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis (self-emptying):** Gore's central category; interpreted as voluntary self-limitation of divine self-expression within the Incarnation, not as loss of divine essence.
 - Contrast: "limitation of operation" vs. "ontological loss."
- **Hypostatic union:** The personal union of divine and human in Christ; the non-negotiable framework for interpreting kenosis.
- **Chalcedonian definition:** Governing norm that preserves two natures without confusion or division; Gore repeatedly appeals to it.
- **Divine impassibility:** Preserved by Gore; God's essential being not altered by the Incarnation though God enters suffering in the human nature.
- **Humiliation and Exaltation:** Traditional soteriological schema used to explain the economy of the Son's work, read through a non-reductive kenotic lens.
- **Revelation:** Christ as the definitive self-disclosure of God; belief in Christ is trust in that revelation embodied.
- **Faith/Belief:** For Gore, personal trust and allegiance rooted in the person and work of the incarnate Son rather than mere doctrinal assent.
- **Agency of the Son:** Emphasizes continuity of the Son's divine agency even within self-limitation; no transfer of divine power into mere creatureliness.
- **Atonement/Union:** Union in the hypostatic union is the basis for effective atonement-Christ's human experiences are salvifically efficacious because of personal unity with the divine.
- **Mode of operation:** Technical phrase Gore favors to describe how divine attributes can be put into relation with human experience without ontological loss.
- **Historical-ecclesial method:** Uses tradition and creedal categories to restrain speculative innovations.
- **Moral and existential tone of belief:** Belief as lived response to the incarnate God.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for balanced kenosis formulations that preserve Chalcedon.
 - As a **polemic** against radical kenotic reductions that threat divine impassibility and the integrity of the Trinity.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for preaching and pastoral instruction on the meaning of the Incarnation and Christian trust.
