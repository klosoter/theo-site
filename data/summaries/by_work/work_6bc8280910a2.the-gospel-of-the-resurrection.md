### TITLE
The Gospel of the Resurrection - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton conservatism; corrective to liberal and naturalistic treatments of Christianity that spiritualized or denied the historic resurrection. Warfield writes within a Reformed, confessional horizon committed to biblical authority and orthodox Christology.
- **Central thesis**
 - The historical, bodily resurrection of Jesus is the indispensable center of the gospel: its factuality undergirds justification, Christian assurance, and the hope of final redemption for both persons and creation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern skepticism reduces the resurrection to metaphor or myth and severs it from historical claim.
 - Demonstration: scriptural and apostolic witness (especially Paul and the Gospel narratives) establishes the resurrection as historical event and apostolic kerygma.
 - Theological consequences:
 - Christ's bodily resurrection secures victory over death and the objective basis for salvation.
 - It grounds both present sanctification and future consummation.
 - Eschatological synthesis: the resurrection inaugurates the new age while guaranteeing a future bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary critics of historicity (liberal theologians and critics of the supernatural), relies on Scripture (Pauline corpus, Gospels, Revelation), patristic and Reformed tradition as interpretive backdrops.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and work of the risen Christ), atonement (effectual victory over death), resurrection and eschatology (individual and cosmic), revelation and apostolic witness, assurance, and final judgment.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the gospel's center of gravity in the risen Christ: the resurrection is the historical hinge that integrates justification, present sanctification, and the promise of a renewed creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the resurrection as both a past historical event and the ontological ground of eschatological promise; not merely symbolic or existential.
 - Sharp linkage of individual resurrection with cosmic renewal - salvation is personal and planetary.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal theologians who demythologize the resurrection; opposes both purely "realized" eschatologies that collapse all hope into the present and literalizing premillennial readings that fragment Pauline and Johannine witness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the resurrection as the "gospel" in a narrowly historical and soteriological sense while framing it as the inauguration of the new creation - an antecedent to what later theologians call "inaugurated eschatology."
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed circles for reaffirming historicity and theological centrality of the resurrection; frequently cited in debates about biblical inerrancy, New Testament historiography, and orthodox eschatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a sustained model for integrating exegetical defense of the resurrection with systematic implications for Christology and eschatology; useful for teaching the unity of individual and cosmic dimensions of redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Bodily resurrection** - Warfield insists on corporeal continuity: Christ's risen body is real, not merely spiritual.
- **Historicity** - The resurrection must be upheld as a historical fact; apostolic witness is probative.
- **Apostolic kerygma** - The proclamation of the risen Christ is normative for gospel identity and authority.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The resurrection inaugurates the age to come while awaiting its consummation (bridges realized and future emphases).
 - Related: **Realized vs Future Eschatology** - Warfield affirms significant present effects (realized) but insists upon future, bodily consummation.
- **Individual resurrection** - Personal rising of believers from death to life; grounds final justification and immortality.
- **Cosmic renewal / New Heavens and New Earth** - Resurrection guarantees the eventual refurbishment/transformation of creation, not annihilation.
 - (See Warfield's linkage of personal and cosmic hope under the resurrection motif.)
- **Judgment and assurance** - Resurrection provides objective basis for final judgment and present assurance of salvation.
- **Millennium / Revelation 20** - Warfield is critical of literalist millennium schemes; treats Revelation 20 in canonical and symbolic relation to Pauline eschatology rather than as a standalone blueprint for chronology.
- **Christ's victory over death** - Central soteriological motif: resurrection as decisive defeat of death and Satan.
- **Scriptural witness (1 Corinthians 15)** - Uses Paul's argument as primary exegetical pivot for historicity and theological meaning.
- **Atonement continuity** - Resurrection is the seal and continuation of atonement, not an afterthought.
- **Assurance of believer** - Objective ground for confidence: history, not mere subjective experience, secures hope.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the doctrine of resurrection and its soteriological centrality.
- As a **polemic resource** against demythologizing or purely realized eschatologies and against literalist dispensational millennialism.
- As an **exegetical model** emphasizing Pauline and synoptic harmonization on resurrection claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting individual salvation doctrines with cosmic eschatology (new heavens and new earth).
