### TITLE
Contributions to Vineyard movement literature - Jack Deere

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th century evangelical-charismatic milieu. Deere writes from a broadly evangelical training (formerly Dallas Theological Seminary) entering the emerging Vineyard movement world shaped by John Wimber. His work appears as both personal testimony and pastoral-theological reflection during the 1980s-1990s period when Vineyard praxis and theology were being systematized and widely debated.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Charismatic gifts (prophecy, tongues, healing) are biblically normative and pastorally useful but must be practiced under scriptural testing and accountable church order to avoid error and excess.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Affirmation of continuationism: the Holy Spirit continues to distribute charismatic gifts after the apostolic era.
 - Biblical exegesis supporting the legitimacy of prophecy and healing ministries, in continuity with the NT.
 - Pastoral safeguards: procedures for testing prophecy, limits on ecclesial authority of non-canonical revelation, and emphasis on fruit and conformity to Scripture.
 - Practical guidance for integrating charismatic practice into congregational life (worship, evangelism, pastoral care).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: Vineyard practitioners (notably John Wimber and movement leaders) and evangelical/cessationist critics (representatives of conservative Reformed and non-charismatic evangelicalism).
 - Scripture as primary source; draws on NT passages on gifts (1 Corinthians, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, Acts) and pastoral epistles for order.
 - Uses pastoral experience and testimonies as evidential support while appealing to exegetical norms.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (gifts, Spirit-empowered ministry), revelation and its limits (canonical sufficiency vs. prophetic word), ecclesiology (order, authority, worship), soteriology as it relates to assurance and experiential confirmation, occasional engagement with healing and Christology in ministry context.
- **Closing line:** Deere's theological center of gravity is a disciplined continuationism: charismatic practice affirmed and encouraged, but continually measured by Scripture, tested by community, and constrained by pastoral order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Pastoral-practical balance: enthusiasm for Spirit-given gifts coupled with systematic procedures for verification and accountability.
 - Emphasis on ordinary congregational integration rather than pietistic individualism or sensationalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects cessationist overrejection of gifts by arguing for continued exegetical warrant and contemporary fruit.
 - Counters radical charismatic permissiveness by insisting prophecy be non-canonical, subordinate to Scripture, and judged publicly.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operational categories such as tested/untested prophecy, verifiable healing testimony, and normative vs. descriptive accounts of extraordinary acts.
 - Framing charismatic phenomena as pastoral tools rather than autonomous proof of spirituality.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among moderate charismatics and Vineyard-adjacent pastors as a temperate, authoritative voice bridging evangelical scholarship and experiential practice.
 - Criticized by strict cessationists for conceding too much, and by some radical charismatics for imposing procedural limits.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a model for combining evangelical exegesis with pastoral prudence in pneumatology courses and congregational training.
 - Useful case study in managing theological plurality within a movement transitioning from revival practice to institutional formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism:** The view that charismatic gifts continue; Deere defends this as biblically normative and pastorally necessary.
- **Cessationism:** The opposing stance that apostolic gifts ceased; Deere critiques common cessationist arguments and offers counter-exegesis.
- **Prophecy (tested/non-binding):** Prophetic words may edify but must be tested against Scripture and community; not equal to canonical revelation.
- **Tongues (contextual use):** Recognized as legitimate but to be exercised with interpretation and order in worship.
- **Healing (power evangelism vs. pastoral care):** Healing ministry is both evangelistically significant (as in Vineyard praxis) and part of pastoral care, requiring discernment.
- **Verification/Testing:** Practical criteria for evaluating prophetic words and healings (Scriptural conformity, fruit, communal testing).
- **Experiential authority vs. Scriptural authority:** Deere insists experience must be subordinate to Scripture; experience is evidential, not normative.
- **Ecclesial order/accountability:** Structures and leadership oversight required to integrate gifts healthily into church life.
- **Normative vs. descriptive pneumatology:** Distinguishes what the NT prescribes for church life (normative) from historical/descriptive accounts of Spirit activity.
- **Fruit (ethical/evangelical outcomes):** The practical measure of a gift's authenticity: character change, evangelistic fruit, doctrinal conformity.
- **Pastoral prudence:** The ethic governing the use of charismatic gifts in ministry contexts.
- **Integration (worship, discipleship):** How gifts are embedded into regular congregational rhythms without devolving into spectacle.
- **Canon and non-canonical revelation:** Canon remains the final authority; prophetic utterances are non-binding and subordinate.
- **Movement theology (Vineyard idiom):** Emphasizes power evangelism, signs-and-wonders, and accessible worship; Deere helps moderate these emphases with safeguards.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for responsible continuationism and tested prophecy in pastoral theology.
- As a **polemic** resource against both extreme cessationism and unregulated charismatic excess.
- As an **exegetical/practical model** for teaching pneumatology, worship formation, and congregational policy on gifts.
