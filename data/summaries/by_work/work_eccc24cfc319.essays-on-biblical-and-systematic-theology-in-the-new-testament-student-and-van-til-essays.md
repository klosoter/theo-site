### TITLE
**Essays on Biblical and Systematic Theology** (in The New Testament Student and Van Til: Essays in Honor of Cornelius Van Til) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; Van Til as central figure in the developing presuppositional school of apologetics.
 - Reaction to Enlightenment epistemology, liberal higher criticism, and evidentialist apologetics; conversation with Geerhardus Vos (redemptive-historical biblical theology), Karl Barth (neo‑orthodoxy), and contemporary systematicians.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must begin with the self-revelation of God in Scripture; biblical theology (the historical, progressive revelation) supplies the only legitimate starting points for systematic theology. Any system that presumes neutral, autonomous reason undermines Christian truth.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern theology and apologetics often err by treating facts as religiously neutral or by beginning with human reason.
 - Grounding move: Scripture is authoritative and self-authenticating; revelation furnishes the presuppositions that shape correct thought about God, world, and man.
 - Methodological prescription:
 - Biblical theology traces the historical, redemptive development of revelation (types, covenants, Christocentric center).
 - Systematic theology organizes and defines doctrine but must be governed by biblical categories and presuppositions.
 - Apologetics is continuous with theology: it argues from the necessary presuppositions of the Christian revelation and exposes the inconsistency of non-Christian presuppositions.
 - Practical implications: doctrine, ethics, and apologetics follow from a theocentric, covenantal reading of Scripture; the noetic effects of sin invalidate claims to neutral starting points.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Geerhardus Vos (biblical theology), Karl Barth (points of convergence and divergence), contemporary evidentialists and philosophical rationalists; draws on Reformed confessions and Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (priority and character), Scripture (authority and self-authentication), epistemology (presuppositions, noetic effects of sin), Christology (centrality in redemptive history), Trinity (ground of revelation), covenant thought, apologetics as theological.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology must be **theocentric and Scripture‑grounded**: biblical theology provides the historically revealed content; systematic theology must organize that content only under the presuppositions supplied by God's self-revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Insistence that all thought is presuppositional; there are no neutral facts apart from theological commitments.
 - Fusion of apologetics with systematic theology: apologetics is not a preliminary appendix but an expression of theological presuppositions.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Enlightenment and evidentialist moves by denying the legitimacy of starting from autonomous reason or "neutral" empirical facts.
 - Distinguishes himself from some forms of Barthianism by maintaining a distinct Reformed epistemic and covenantal framework.
 - Builds on Vos's redemptive-historical approach but insists it be integrated with presuppositional epistemology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Sharp deployment of "presupposition" language to theology and apologetics; articulation of the "antithesis" between Christian and non-Christian thought as epistemological, not merely moral.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; foundational for later presuppositional apologists (Greg Bahnsen, John Frame).
 - Contested by evidentialists and some neo‑orthodox thinkers; stimulated sustained debate about methods in theology and apologetics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes rigorous attention to the epistemic foundations of theology; valuable for training in theological method, for polemical engagement with secularism, and for integrating biblical-historical insight with doctrinal formulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - The claim that all reasoning presupposes ultimate commitments; Christian theology must make the Christian presupposition explicit and primary.
- **Biblical theology** - The historical, redemptive unfolding of revelation in Scripture; supplies the narrative and categories for doctrinal reflection.
- **Systematic theology** - The orderly articulation of doctrine; legitimate only when anchored to biblical presuppositions.
- **Self‑authenticating Scripture** - Scripture bears its own authority and must be the normative starting point for theology and apologetics.
- **Noetic effects of sin** - Sin distorts human knowing; neutral epistemology is impossible because human cognition is affected by sin.
- **Antithesis** - Fundamental epistemological and moral opposition between Christian and non-Christian worldviews.
- **Redemptive‑historical method** - Emphasis on covenant and Christ as center of biblical history; biblical theology traces this development.
- **Correlation (critique of)** - Rejection of starting theology by correlating human experience and revelation on supposedly neutral terms.
- **Theocentricism** - God as the ultimate center of theological method and content.
- **Covenant vocabulary** - Use of covenantal categories to interpret redemptive history and structure systematic claims.
- **Apologetics as theology** - Apologetics derives from and serves theological presuppositions rather than being an external defense.
- **Transcendence/Immanence** - Balance: God's otherness grounds revelation; His self‑communication makes knowledge possible.
- **Authority vs. Autonomy** - Rejection of human autonomy in epistemology; affirmation of divine authority as epistemic ground.
- **Common grace (qualified)** - Acknowledges non‑Christian insights but insists they lack ultimate epistemic grounding without Christian presuppositions.
- **Analogy of faith** - Systematic formulations must cohere with the narrative and doctrinal contours of Scripture.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional method and the relation of biblical to systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialism, Enlightenment neutrality, and theological systems that detach from Scripture.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** for integrating redemptive‑historical biblical study with confessional doctrinal formulation.
