### TITLE
The Holy Spirit (1976) - Anthony Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the mid-1970s amid the rise of the charismatic movement and renewed scholarly attention to pneumatology. Written from a Reformed-evangelical perspective engaging both academic and pastoral audiences.
 - Milieu: reaction to charismatic claims of a post-conversion "baptism in the Spirit" and a resurgence of interest in gifts, while also dialoguing with historic Reformed accounts of sanctification and assurance.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Hoekema argues that orthodox pneumatology must maintain the personal deity and Trinitarian work of the Spirit while correcting theological and practical errors in charismatic emphases. The Spirit's work is both definitive (positional) and progressive (experiential), united with Christ's redeeming work and ordered by Scripture.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of the person and deity of the Spirit (personhood, divine attributes, relation within the Trinity).
 - The Spirit's saving work:
 - **Regeneration and indwelling**: the Spirit is the agent of new birth and immediate indwelling at conversion (see note on Regeneration And Indwelling).
 - **Sanctification**: distinguishes **definitive (positional)** sanctification given in union with Christ and **progressive** sanctification as ongoing moral transformation (see note on Sanctification Definitive And Progressive).
 - **Spiritual gifts**: gifts are given by the Spirit for the edification of the church; Hoekema critiques doctrines that separate Spirit-baptism from conversion and that elevate certain sign gifts as normative (see note on Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification).
 - Practical consequences: assurance, adoption, prayer, and Christian living are grounded in the Spirit's work through Scripture.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Scripture (esp. Pauline pneumatology), classic Reformed authors, and contemporary charismatic/Pentecostal advocates. Dialogues implicitly with proponents of a second blessing/Spirit-baptism theology and with those who claim the cessation or continuation of sign gifts as decisive.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (role and relation of Spirit), Christology (Spirit's relation to Christ's work), soteriology (regeneration, adoption, assurance), sanctification (definitive vs progressive), pneumatological gifts, Scripture and illumination, ecclesiology (gifts for church edification).

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers on a balanced Reformed pneumatology that insists the Spirit's sovereign, Trinitarian activity secures salvation and progressive holiness while resisting extrabiblical innovations in the charismatic movement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Clear, balanced distinction between **definitive (positional)** sanctification and **progressive (experiential)** sanctification; both are the Spirit's work but differ in timing and expression.
 - Emphasizes the immediacy of regeneration and indwelling-conversion is the normative point of Spirit-baptism rather than a subsequent ecstatic event.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic/Pentecostal claims that Spirit-baptism is a distinct, subsequent empowering experience; argues instead for conversion-centered Spirit-baptism and normative sufficiency of Scripture.
 - Counters simplistic cessationist or credal extremes by allowing for continuance of gifts while restraining charismatic excesses.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Operationally clarifies modern debates by framing them within the twofold sanctification rubric (definitive vs progressive) and by distinguishing the Spirit's regenerative act from subsequent empowering experiences.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a corrective primer on pneumatology during the charismatic debates of the late 20th century.
 - Influential for pastors and teachers who sought a measured response to charismatic claims without abandoning affirmation of spiritual gifts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, scripturally anchored model for teaching about the Spirit that remains useful for courses on pneumatology, pastoral theology, and debates concerning gifts and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit** - Third person of the Trinity; fully divine, personal, and active in salvation and sanctification.
- **Regeneration** - The Spirit's sovereign act of new birth; immediate and the normative sphere of Spirit-baptism (Regeneration And Indwelling).
- **Indwelling** - Permanent presence of the Spirit in believers beginning at conversion (Regeneration And Indwelling).
- **Sanctification (definitive)** - Positional holiness granted in union with Christ; a one-time status change effected by the Spirit (Sanctification Definitive And Progressive).
- **Sanctification (progressive)** - The ongoing moral and experiential transformation wrought by the Spirit in the believer's life (Sanctification Definitive And Progressive).
- **Spirit-baptism** - Hoekema locates this with conversion rather than as a later ecstatic experience; opposes theology that makes it a separate normative event.
- **Spiritual gifts (charismata)** - Diverse gifts granted by the Spirit for church edification; to be judged and regulated by Scripture (Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification).
 - Sub-contrast: **Sign gifts** (prophecy, tongues) vs. **edifying gifts** - both present historically, but claims about contemporary normative signs must be tested biblically.
- **Fruit of the Spirit** - Ethical evidence of Spirit-work; integrated with progressive sanctification.
- **Illumination/Testimony of the Spirit** - Spirit's role in applying Scripture to the heart and assuring believers of their standing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for orthodox Reformed accounts of regeneration, indwelling, and the relation of Spirit-baptism to conversion.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against charismatic formulations that separate Spirit-baptism from conversion or overemphasize certain sign gifts.
 - As an **exegetical/pedagogical model** for teaching the twofold nature of sanctification and for integrating pneumatology into soteriology and pastoral practice.
