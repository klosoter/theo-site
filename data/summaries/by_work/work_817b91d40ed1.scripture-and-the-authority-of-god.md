### TITLE
Scripture and the Authority of God - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century intervention in longstanding evangelical debates over biblical authority, inerrancy, and hermeneutics.
 - Responds to both conservative inerrancy movements and liberal historical criticism; situated within the revival of biblical-theological and canonical approaches.
 - Wright writes as an Anglican New Testament scholar engaged with church practice, historical Jesus studies, and the "new perspective" on Paul.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The authority of Scripture is properly understood as God's self-attesting action recorded and interpreted within the covenantal, historical story culminating in Jesus Christ - not reducible to modernist propositional inerrancy nor to merely subjective reception.
 - Problem addressed: how to ground Scripture's authority for doctrine, preaching, and mission in a way faithful to both historical-critical scholarship and ecclesial faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern debates polarize (strict inerrancy vs. privatized faith); both miss how the Bible functions as covenantal narrative and witness.
 - Method: recover a canonical, narrative- and history-sensitive hermeneutic that reads the Bible as the church's collected witness to God's saving acts.
 - Major moves:
 - Re-describe Scripture as the church's testimony to God's deeds (creation, election, covenant, exodus, kingship, exile, and restoration in Christ).
 - Insist on the centrality of Jesus (and his resurrection) as the decisive hermeneutical key that validates and reinterprets the Hebrew Scriptures.
 - Re-articulate "authority" as relational and performative - Scripture commands because it tells of a God who acts and calls; the church worships and listens as the community formed by that story.
 - Practical implications: preaching, doctrine formation, and ecclesial practice must remain historically informed and christocentric, using typology and fulfillment as legitimate interpretive tools.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with conservative evangelical inerrantist positions (implicitly dialogues with G. K. Chesterton-style apologetics, and explicit opponents in evangelicalism), and with canonical/biblical theologians (e.g., Brevard Childs), historical critics, and patristic resources.
 - Draws heavily on Second Temple context and New Testament apostolic kerygma as hermeneutical anchors.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, covenant theology, Christology (central), resurrection as validation, hermeneutics (typology, fulfillment), ecclesiology (Scripture's role in the church).

- **Closing line**
 - Scripture's authority is rooted in the reality of God's covenantal acts, confessed and canonized by the church, and read christologically: the Bible authoritatively witnesses to the God who acts in Christ and is vindicated in history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong narrative-canonical framework: Scripture is a witnessed story rather than primarily a set of abstract propositions.
 - Resurrection-centered authority: the risen Jesus as hermeneutical and epistemic linchpin for reading Scripture.
 - Typology as living, historically grounded patterning (not merely allegory).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves beyond conservative inerrantist reductionism by rejecting a flat, modernist notion of propositional certainty divorced from history and genre.
 - Distances from some postliberal/canon-focused approaches that minimize historical grounding; Wright insists on historical embodiment (Jesus, resurrection, apostolic witness) as non-negotiable.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "authority" in terms of **covenantal action + narrative testimony** rather than simple verbal inerrancy.
 - Uses "fulfillment" and "typology" as theological-historical categories (events and persons instantiate covenant patterns).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and mainline circles; taken up by biblical theologians, homileticians, and those rethinking inerrancy.
 - Criticized by strict inerrantists for downplaying propositional formulations; praised by many for integrating scholarship and ecclesial faith.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating historical-critical insight with confessional reading; practical for preaching and doctrinal formation.
 - Clarifies how typology and fulfillment can be hermeneutically responsible and theologically central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Authority (covenantal-narrative)** - Scripture authoritatively witnesses to God's acts; authority flows from God's action attested by canonical witness.
- **Inspiration (dual authorship)** - Human literary variety plus divine purpose; Wright emphasizes historical embeddedness over uniform propositional inerrancy.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology** - 
 - Biblical theology: tracing the Bible's storyline and its theological dynamics.
 - Systematic theology: theological ordering that must be rooted in the narrative track provided by Scripture; Wright insists biblical theology provides the raw materials and hermeneutical shape for systematic work.
- **Christ in OT and NT** - Continuity: OT promises and patterns find decisive realization in Jesus; Christ is the hermeneutical key for both Testaments.
- **Typology and Fulfillment** - Typology is not mere allegory but historical patterning: persons/events in Israel prefigure and are fulfilled in Christ's person and work.
- **Resurrection as epistemic criterion** - The resurrection authenticates Jesus' identity and thereby grounds the apostolic testimony and Scripture's claim.
- **Canonical reading** - Treat the Bible as church-received corpus; the canon shapes theological reading without excising historical-critical questions.
- **Apostolic kerygma** - The early preaching that interprets Jesus as fulfillment of Israel's story; primary locus of theological authority.
- **Hermeneutical realism** - Scripture refers to real historical events; theological reading must remain historically anchored.
- **Ecclesial formation** - Scripture's authority is exercised within worship, preaching, and sacramental life of the church.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for authority conceived as covenantal-narrative, not merely propositional inerrancy.
- As a **polemic** against both strict inerrantism and reductionist criticism, proposing a middle way.
- As an **exegetical model** for christocentric, typological reading of OT-NT relations and for integrating historical research with theological interpretation.
