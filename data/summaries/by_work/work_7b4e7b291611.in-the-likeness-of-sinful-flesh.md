### TITLE
In the Likeness of Sinful Flesh - Thomas Weinandy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Roman Catholic Christological study situated in the post-Vatican II theological milieu; written in reaction to modern reductions of Christ's humanity (liberal, existential, and certain kenotic readings) and in conversation with the classical patristic and scholastic tradition.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ assumed truly human nature "in the likeness of sinful flesh": he shared the real conditions, frailties, and susceptibility to temptation that belong to human existence without personally sinning. The problem is to account theologically and exegetically for that phrase while preserving Chalcedonian and Trinitarian commitments.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of key texts (Philippians 2:7; Romans 8:3; Hebrews; Gospel narratives) to define what Paul and the New Testament mean by "likeness" and "sinful flesh."
 - Historical-theological survey showing continuity with Fathers (Athanasius, Augustine) and scholastics (esp. Aquinas) on the real but sinless humanity of Christ.
 - Critical engagement with modern alternatives:
 - Rejects kenotic accounts that empty divine personhood of attributes as explanatorily inadequate.
 - Critiques theological reduces that make Christ's humanity merely apparitional or non-constitutive of real human vulnerability.
 - Constructive proposal: nuanced conceptual distinction between human condition (including propensity to sin, finitude, ignorance, suffering) and personal sinfulness; defense of Christ's impeccability together with genuine human experiences and temptations.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Scripture (Pauline corpus, Hebrews, Gospels), Church Fathers (Athanasius, Augustine), scholasticism (Aquinas), Chalcedonian formula; engages modern kenotic theologians and existential/liberal Christologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), anthropology (human nature, concupiscence), hamartiology (nature of sin, propensity vs. act), soteriology (solidarity and atonement), and implications for revelation and salvation history.
- **Closing line**
 - Weinandy locates the redemptive significance of the incarnation in Christ's authentic sharing of human frailty-truly "in the likeness of sinful flesh"-while safeguarding that this sharing never entails personal sin.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Sharp distinction between *likeness* (similitude to human condition) and *identity with sin*; "sinful flesh" read as descriptive of human existential condition, not as predication of Christ's person.
 - Strong insistence that genuine human vulnerability (temptation, suffering, limited knowledge) is essential to the incarnation's soteriological efficacy.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic accounts that posit a real divestment of divine attributes as the explanatory mechanism for Christ's human limitations.
 - Counters liberal/existential reductions that make Jesus' humanity an existentially authentic but theologically non-redemptive category.
 - Reclaims classic Chalcedonian witness against both a docetic minimization of humanity and a Nestorian severance of natures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the phrase "likeness of sinful flesh" as a theological hinge: a way to articulate concomitantly Christ's genuine human condition and his personal sinlessness.
 - Nuanced vocabulary for talking about *propensity* (or vulnerability) versus *actual sin* in the incarnate Logos.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Roman Catholic and ecumenical circles as a corrective to modern distortions; cited in pastoral and academic discussions on temptability and Christ's human experience.
 - Resonates with many conservative and ecumenical theologians; less persuasive to radical kenoticists or those who prioritize existential readings of Philippians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies a persistent theological tension-how Jesus can be fully human and yet sinless-and provides a stable framework teachable across confessional lines.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Likeness of sinful flesh"**
 - Central exegetical phrase framed as indicating resemblance to the human condition (frailty, propensity to sin) without personal sinfulness.
- **Peccability / Impeccability**
 - Distinguished: Christ is *impeccable* in that he did not sin; yet his humanity was not *impeccable* in the sense of being exempt from temptation or suffering.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - Used to secure how one person (the Logos) can possess a truly human nature with all attendant vulnerabilities without personal sin.
- **Kenosis / exinanition**
 - Critically assessed; Weinandy rejects formulations that imply a real loss of divine attributes as explanatory for human limitation.
- **Propensity / vulnerability**
 - Technical language for the human condition: susceptibility to temptation and suffering that does not equate to committing sin.
- **Concupiscence**
 - Treated as part of the human situation assumed by Christ (object of temptation) but not as an inner principle of sin proper to his person.
- **Solidarity / identification**
 - Soteriological term: Christ's real sharing of human condition is the ground for atonement and representation.
- **Chalcedonian continuity**
 - Emphasized as the hermeneutical-ecclesial benchmark for any account of Christ's human and divine natures.
- **Exegetical model**
 - Philippians and Romans as keys for reading incarnation language; Weinandy models careful lexical and theological reading.
- **Implicated loci**
 - Anthropology, hamartiology, soteriology: his distinctions inform pastoral teaching on temptation and moral struggle.
- How this work is used:
 - As an authoritative exegetical-theological resource when defining the meaning of "likeness" in Pauline Christology.
 - As a polemic against kenotic and docetic tendencies that undermine classical doctrines of the incarnation.
 - As an exegetical model and conceptual pivot in courses and essays on Christ's humanity, temptation, and soteriological solidarity.
