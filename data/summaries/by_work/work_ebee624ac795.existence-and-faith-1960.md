### TITLE
Existence and Faith (1960) - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Post‑World War II German theological landscape; matured phase of Bultmann's project of New Testament interpretation and existential hermeneutics.
 - Situated within mid‑20th century existential theology and conversation with Heideggerian philosophy and Kierkegaardian existentialism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Faith is not assent to propositions about past events but an existential encounter and decision in response to the kerygma; modernity requires a "demythologized" proclamation that reveals the call of God as existential breaking‑in.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose modern human existence: estrangement, finitude, guilt and need for authentic decision.
 - Reinterpret New Testament witness: distinguish between mythic cosmology and the existential content of the proclamation (kerygma).
 - Present faith as response/acceptance (existential decision) to the Christ‑event as event of revelation rather than an object for historical verification.
 - Soteriology: salvation as existential transformation accomplished through encounter with the proclaimed Christ; the Spirit's role is to effect existential appropriation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical interlocutors: Martin Heidegger (existential ontology), Søren Kierkegaard (existential faith, decision).
 - Biblical and theological interlocutors: Paul (especially kerygma and justification motifs), New Testament narrative; engagement with liberal historicism and with neo‑orthodox currents (e.g., Barth) though disagreement remains.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as event/encounter), Christology (Christ as proclaimed event), Soteriology (existence and decision), Anthropology (existential condition of man), Sin (existential estrangement), Pneumatology (effect of proclamation), Bibliology (status of New Testament as witness not documentary proof), Eschatology (presentness of eschatological event).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Theology must recover the kerygma as an existential summons: faith is the human response to God's eventful breaking‑in, not mere historical or metaphysical assent.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological pivot to existential hermeneutics: priority of human existence (Dasein) and decision for interpreting scripture.
 - Demythologization as hermeneutical program: remove cosmological myth to expose existential proclamation.
 - Christ as event (Erlebnis) rather than primarily a historical object to be proven by historiography.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Opposes liberal theology's confidence in religious progress and objective religious development; rejects naive literal historicism and proof‑seeking apologetics.
 - Complex distance from Barth: both stress revelation's priority, but Bultmann insists on existential reinterpretation where Barth affirmed the historicity of revelation differently and resisted reduction to existential categories.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts "faith" as existential decision and "kerygma" as demythologized proclamation; integrates Heideggerian vocabulary into theological method.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Protestant biblical theology and homiletics mid‑20th century; stimulated waves of existential and hermeneutical theology.
 - Faced sustained critique from conservative and evangelical theologians for downplaying historical claims (resurrection, miracles) and from some neo‑orthodox circles for methodological reductionism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes enduring questions about the relation of history, proclamation, and existential appropriation; valuable for hermeneutics, pastoral theology, and rethinking how scripture addresses modern unbelief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma**
 - The apostolic proclamation; for Bultmann the kernel that must be translated into existential terms.
- **Demythologization**
 - Method for removing mythic cosmology to disclose existential message; not denial of value but reinterpretation for contemporary understanding.
- **Existence (Dasein)**
 - Anthropological category borrowed from existential philosophy; human beings understood as situated, finite, decision‑making agents.
- **Faith (Glaube)**
 - Existential acceptance/decision in response to the proclamation; transformative encounter rather than intellectual assent.
- **Christ‑event**
 - The evental character of Christ's revelation; central saving reality encountered in proclamation, prioritized over documentary historicism.
- **Revelation as encounter**
 - Revelation is an event that breaks into human existence, eliciting response, rather than a set of propositional truths to be merely verified.
- **Sin / estrangement**
 - Described existentially: inauthentic living, alienation from God and self that grounds need for the kerygma.
- **Spirit (Pneuma)**
 - The operative agent effecting appropriation of the kerygmatic event in the believer's existence.
- **New Testament as witness**
 - Scripture functions as witness to the proclamation; authority lies in its capacity to mediate the kerygma existentially, not as forensic proof.
- **Eschatological breaking‑in**
 - The present, decisive intrusion of God's eschatological act into human history as interpretive key.
- **Authenticity / decision**
 - Ethical‑existential categories describing responsible human response to the call.
- **Hermeneutical translation**
 - The task of rendering the kerygma intelligible to modern existential questions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for existential approaches to faith and soteriology (what faith 'is' existentially).
- As a **polemic** against both naive historicism and optimistic liberal religion, used by later critics and defenders.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and New Testament theology that prioritizes proclamation over purely historical reconstruction.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about the place of myth, history, and language in theological method.
