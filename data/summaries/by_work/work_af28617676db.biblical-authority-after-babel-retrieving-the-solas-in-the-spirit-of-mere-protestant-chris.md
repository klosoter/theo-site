### TITLE
**Biblical Authority after Babel: Retrieving the Solas in the Spirit of Mere Protestant Christianity** 
Kevin J. Vanhoozer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid debates over postmodern pluralism, ecclesial fragmentation, and evangelical identity. Intervenes in contemporary Protestant theology seeking an ecumenical "mere Christianity" recapture of the Solas.
 - Conversations with hermeneutics, postliberal and narrative theologies (e.g., Hans Frei, Robert Jenson), and analytic theology; addresses pressures from secular epistemology and scientistic models of knowledge.

- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical authority must be reconceived after Babel: authority is not authoritarian propositional fiat nor reducible to private proof-texting, but is ecclesially mediated, performative, and grounded in the self-attesting Word of God such that the Reformation Solas can be retrieved in a public, communal idiom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses the Babel problem: pluralism, interpretive fragmentation, and the decline of shared propositional vocabulary that once sustained sola scriptura.
 - Theological method: argues for a disciplined theology ("Principia: theology as a principled disciplinary science") that respects norms of reason and canonical warrant without mimicking natural science. Theology is a practiced, rule-governed discipline that serves the church.
 - Rearticulates authority in speech-act and canonical terms: Scripture as God's communicative action (Word-event) whose authority is exercised in the church's practices.
 - Reclaims the Solas by re-locating them within ecclesial, Trinitarian, and canonical frameworks rather than individualist or purely propositional accounts.
 - Integrates biblical theology and systematic theology: canonical exegesis supplies the narrative and doctrinal content that systematic theology disciplines and applies.

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages Karl Barth (via Barthian emphases on revelation), Hans Frei and the Yale school (narrative and reader-response), and more conservative Protestant caretakers of the Solas.
 - Dialogues with contemporary hermeneuts and philosophers of religion about authorial intent, speech-act theory, and epistemic authority.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, canonicity, Word-event)
 - Christology and Trinity (as the locus for authority and interpretive norm)
 - Ecclesiology (authority exercised and mediated in the church)
 - Soteriology implicitly via Solas (faith, grace, Christ, Scripture as normative)

- **Closing line**
 - Vanhoozer aims to show that recovering the Solas after Babel requires a robust, ecclesial, and communicative doctrine of Scripture that treats theology as a principled discipline serving the church's life and witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves from propositionalist accounts of authority to a **performative, speech-act model**: Scripture is authoritative because it is God speaking effectually within the church.
 - Stresses an **ecclesial hermeneutic**: authority is mediated by communal practices, not private proof-texting.
 - Reasserts the Solas within a **canonical-Trinitarian framework** (Scripture and Word in relation to the incarnate Word).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both fundamentalist literalism and relativist postmodernism by refusing a binary: neither authoritarian sola-scriptura nor laissez-faire pluralism.
 - Opposes analogia entis (analogy of being) tendencies that ground theology in creaturely metaphysics; favors analogia fidei (analogy of faith) and revelation-centered norms.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Synthesizes speech-act theory with canonical theology to reconceive biblical authority.
 - Frames theology as a serviceable "science" with principia-orderly, principled, and ecclesially accountable-without scientism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a credible intellectual retrieval of the Solas; used in graduate theological curricula on hermeneutics and doctrine.
 - Cited by those wanting an ecumenical Protestant center (the "Mere Protestant" project); debated by both conservatives (on sufficiency/propositionality) and postliberals (on authorial intent).

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable model for teaching Scripture, integrating exegesis and dogmatics, and equipping the church to claim coherent authority in plural contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Solas** - Reformational shorthand (Scripture, Christ, Grace, Faith, Glory to God) retrieved within a communal, canonical frame.
- **Mere Protestant Christianity** - A minimal, ecumenical Protestant core Vanhoozer aims to recover; not doctrinal minimalism but confessional common ground.
- **Scripture as Word-event** - Scripture considered an active communicative act of God (speech-act), not merely a repository of propositions.
- **Performative authority** - Authority that issues from the efficacy of God's speech and is realized in the church's obedient response.
- **Ecclesial hermeneutic** - Interpretation located in and governed by the practices and norms of the believing community.
- **Principia (Theological Method as Science)** - Theology understood as a principled, disciplined science with internal norms (distinct from natural science but rigorous).
 - Relates to methodological debates: theology is epistemically responsible without capitulating to scientism.
- **Analogia fidei** - Interpretation governed by the analogy of faith; revelation as the norm for theologizing (favored by Vanhoozer).
- **Analogia entis** - Analogy of being; criticized where it grounds knowledge of God in creaturely metaphysics rather than revelation.
- **Canonical reading** - Reading texts in light of the whole canon; integrates biblical theology's narrative shape with doctrinal formulation.
- **Biblical theology vs Systematic theology** - Vanhoozer: complementary disciplines-biblical theology supplies canonical narrative and exegesis; systematic theology organizes and applies doctrine for the church.
- **Authorial intention + community reception** - Balances respect for historical authorial meaning with the church's canonical practices that discern and enact authority.
- **Hermeneutical ecclesiology** - Theology of interpretation that centers the church as the site of authoritative reading.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for an ecclesial, speech-act account of biblical authority and for principled theological method.
 - As a **polemic** against analogia entis, scientistic theology, and privatized readings of Scripture.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot** integrating biblical-theological narrative exegesis with systematic dogmatic application in teaching and ministry.
