### TITLE
Karl Barth - "Anselm: Fides Quaerens Intellectum" 
A focused Barthian reading of Anselm that reorients "faith seeking understanding" within 20th‑century dialectical theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early/mid 20th century Barthian theology; reaction against liberal theology and natural theology; situated in neo‑orthodox recovery of revelation as normative for theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reclaim Anselm's maxim "fides quaerens intellectum" to argue that faith is the starting and controlling principle of true theology: knowledge of God is possible only in and by God's self‑revelation (not by speculative metaphysics or an autonomous natural theology).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Faith is prior to and determinant for theological knowing; theology is response to revelation rather than autonomous philosophical inquiry.
 - Distinguishes two models of analogy:
 - **Analogia entis** (analogy of being): seeks continuity between God and creature and underwrites natural theology-rejected as illegitimate for knowledge of God. (Barth, on Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei)
 - **Analogia fidei** (analogy of faith): affirms asymmetry; God is known only by revelation; analogies are governed by faith's content and revelation in Christ.
 - God's existence and knowability are not established by creaturely demonstration but by divine self‑disclosure; the ontological and natural proofs are subordinated or set aside. (Barth, on Existence and Knowability of God)
 - Christology at the center: since God reveals himself in Jesus Christ, Christology becomes the model and test for any theological claim about God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Anselm (as primary target), Thomas Aquinas and scholastic analogical tradition, Enlightenment natural theology, Luther and Calvin as precursors to the priority of revelation, contemporary critics of Barth (neo‑Thomists).
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, knowledge of God, faith, apologetics/natural theology, Trinity and Christology (as loci where revelation is normative), doctrine of God (otherness and revelation), soteriology implied by Christocentrism.
- **Closing line capturing the gravitational center:** Theology, rightly conceived, is faith seeking understanding under the uncompromising lordship of divine self‑revelation in Christ rather than reason autonomously proving God's being.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Restores Anselmian method to a dialectical, proclamation‑centered theology: faith articulates, tests, and corrects understanding.
 - Recasts analogy not as ontological commonality but as a hermeneutic governed by revelation (analogia fidei).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to scholastic and Thomistic reliance on analogia entis and to Enlightenment natural theology: Barth insists these misplace the source and norm of knowledge.
 - Moves beyond a naïve reading of Anselm as merely an apologist for rational proofs; reads Anselm's "faith first" as compatible with Barthian revelation priority.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Sharp, programmatic use of **analogia fidei** as methodological rule for theology.
 - Emphasis on **asymmetry** between Creator and creature as decisive for theological epistemology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within Reformed and neo‑orthodox circles for reinforcing anti‑natural‑theology stances; provoked sustained debate with Thomists and analytic theologians over possibility of natural knowledge of God.
 - Used as a touchstone in 20th‑century discussions of revelation vs reason and in training pastors in a Christocentric doctrinal method.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the methodological stakes of "faith seeking understanding"; supplies a concise corrective to attempts to naturalize theology.
 - Serves as a pedagogical pivot for courses on revelation, apologetics, and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fides quaerens intellectum:** faith that seeks (and governs) understanding; Barth reads this as theological method rather than merely intellectual curiosity.
- **Analogia entis:** analogy of being; doctrine that grounds continuity between God and creation-criticized by Barth as opening theology to naturalistic presuppositions.
- **Analogia fidei:** analogy of faith; Barth's preferred rule: analogies derive their legitimacy from revealed faith, not creaturely ontologies.
- **Revelation (self‑disclosure):** God's self‑communication in history, uniquely decisive in Christ; serves as epistemic source and norm.
- **Christocentrism:** Christ as the decisive locus of revelation and the measure of theological claims.
- **Natural theology:** speculative knowledge of God from nature or reason alone-barred or radically restrained in Barth's reading.
- **Otherness (totted altitudo):** the qualitative difference of God relative to creatures; grounds Barth's asymmetry claim.
- **Apologetics:** reframed by Barth from proving God's existence to witnessing to revealed knowledge of God.
- **Knowability of God:** not a question of proving existence a priori but of receiving and responding to God's revealed self.
- **Faith (as epistemic act):** both assent and relation that enables understanding; not irrational but revelationally grounded.
- **Ontology vs. Theology:** Barth privileges theological (revelation‑based) over metaphysical/ontological claims about God.
- **Dialectical method:** theological movement between divine revelation and human response, resisting synthesis into natural theology.
- **Asymmetry:** theological principle that Creator-creature relation prevents simple transference of being or attributes.
- **Normativity of Scripture:** Scripture as primary locus and criterion for analogia fidei and doctrinal formulation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against natural theology and scholastic analogies (apologetics, doctrine of God).
- As a **conceptual pivot** and pedagogical model for Christ‑centered epistemology in courses on revelation, Trinity, and theological method.
