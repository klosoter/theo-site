### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Modern academic treatment of Pauline soteriology, situated in Protestant and Reformed debates about ordering of salvation (ordo salutis).
 - Interacts with 20th-21st century exegetical and systematic literature that contests linear or schematic accounts of salvation.
- **Central thesis**
 - Paul's theology locates faith as the decisive human response that mediates salvation, not sight (i.e., not empirical assurance, ritual performance, or meritorious works). Faith orders the believer into union with Christ and frames the ordo salutis.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Romans and Galatians to show faith is soteriological pivot.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for an ordo that centers **union with Christ** and imputational justification prior to or simultaneous with sanctification and assurance.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Against Pelagian/Semi‑Pelagian tendencies that elevate human initiation or merit.
 - Against pietistic or existentialist readings that reduce faith to subjective assurance ("sight").
 - Practical implications: sacraments (esp. baptism) are read as means tied to faith, not automatic channels divorced from faith's content.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Paul (Romans, Galatians), Augustine, later Reformed expositors (Calvin, Dort), and modern interpreters (N. Wright, Dunn, Cranfield).
 - Dialogue with recent critiques of forensic imputation and covenantal models.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (exegetical method), Covenant theology (covenant of grace), Justification (forensic imputation), Union with Christ, Faith and Repentance, Baptism and Sacraments, Nature of sin, Christology (impeccability implied), Eschatological hope (Romans 11).
- **Closing line**
 - The work's theological center of gravity: **faith, as the believer's covenantal response in union with Christ, is the decisive instrument that orders justification, sanctification, and the sacraments - not sight, works, or ritual alone.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes ordo salutis around the relational notion of **union with Christ** rather than a chronological checklist; faith functions as entry into that union.
 - Emphasizes Pauline faith as historically rooted trust (capital F Faith: Israel's promises fulfilled in Christ) over private assurance.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrective to schemes that separate justification temporally from union: insists on their mutual entailment.
 - Counters both legalistic merit paradigms and existentialist accounts that privilege inner experience ("sight") as primary evidence of salvation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses the phrase **"faith‑ordering"** to denote how faith structures the Christian life and sacraments.
 - Distinguishes **evidential assurance** (sight) from **covenantal trust** (faith).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for recuperating classical forensic language while integrating sacramental theology.
 - Cited in debates over infant baptism and covenant membership as a model that insists on faith's content without neglecting covenantal nurture.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact exegetical-theological template for teaching Pauline soteriology; useful for pastors, seminarians, and systematicians confronting modern heterodox alternatives.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith (pistis)** - central human response; covenantal trust that effects entry into union with Christ; distinguished from subjective assurance.
- **Sight** - shorthand for empirical assurance, works‑based confidence, or mere experience; explicitly subordinated to faith.
- **Union with Christ** - relational center of salvation; the ground for imputation, regeneration, and sanctification.
- **Justification / Forensic Imputation** - legally declared righteousness grounded in Christ's work and received by faith.
- **Ordo salutis / faith‑ordering** - reordered emphasis: faith as structuring principle rather than a subsequent historical moment.
- **Covenant of Grace** - theological frame: faith as participation in covenant promises fulfilled in Christ.
- **Baptism** - sacrament tied to faith; efficacy interpreted in covenantal terms, contested re: infant vs believer reception.
 - Relation to infant baptism: baptism as sign in covenant community, requiring ecclesial pedagogy toward personal faith.
- **Nature and Origin of Sin** - sin's universality explains incapacity to earn salvation; faith is the God‑given gift that overcomes this alienation.
- **Faith and Repentance** - paired: repentance as turning, faith as trust; both required but faith is primary instrument.
- **Pelagianism / Semi‑Pelagianism** - foil for the argument; used to define what Pauline faith is not.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - presupposed; Christ's sinlessness grounds imputational righteousness.
- **Good Works and Merit** - good works as necessary fruit and covenant evidence, not meritorious causes.
- **Romans 11 (Israel's Future)** - used to anchor faith within the corporate story of Israel and God's promises.
- **Sacramental theology** - reading sacraments through faith‑centered covenantal lens.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for Pauline faith as the instrument of salvation in soteriological summaries.
- As a **polemic tool** against semi‑Pelagian and subjectivist accounts that conflate assurance with salvific faith.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans/Galatians that prioritizes union with Christ when constructing the ordo salutis.
