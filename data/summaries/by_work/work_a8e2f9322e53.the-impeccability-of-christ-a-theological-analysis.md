### TITLE
**The Impeccability of Christ: A Theological Analysis** 
Adam J. Johnson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary theological study rooted in late 20th-21st-century evangelical and Reformed academic milieus. Engages both historical tradition and recent analytic philosophy of religion; aimed at seminary students, pastors, and scholars concerned with Christology and soteriology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Johnson argues that Christ's impeccability - that Jesus could not sin - is both theologically necessary for orthodox soteriology and philosophically defensible without collapsing divine freedom or the reality of his temptations.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Analytical framing: defines key senses of "could" (logical, metaphysical, moral, and hypothetical ability) and isolates the relevant sense for impeccability.
 - Biblical exegesis: close readings of Heb 4:15, Luke 4, Matthew passion narratives, and Pauline affirmations of sinlessness; argues texts support real temptation plus real inability to sin.
 - Historical theology: surveys patristic, medieval, and Reformation positions (Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Scotus, Luther, Calvin), tracing how the debate has been framed by doctrines of divinity, freedom, and the hypostatic union.
 - Philosophical-theological synthesis: advances a model in which Christ's human will is genuinely free yet non-occurrent toward sin because of the union with the divine will and the moral necessity established by his communion with the Father.
 - Practical implications: explores atonement (necessity of sinless obedience), pastoral assurance (Christ as flawless mediator), and Christ's true solidarity with humanity (real suffering and temptation despite impeccability).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas, Duns Scotus, Martin Luther, John Calvin, Karl Barth; contemporary analytic theologians on freedom and divine incapacity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union), Trinity (implications for divine will and impassibility), hamartiology, soteriology (atonement theories), anthropology (human will), and pastoral theology (assurance, sanctification).
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** Johnson defends a balanced account that preserves Christ's real freedom and genuine temptations while maintaining that, because of his unique divine-human identity, Christ could not sin - a position presented as essential to orthodox atonement and faithful discipleship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful lexical distinction among types of ability (logical, metaphysical, moral, causal) and insisting that "impeccability" refers to a non-accidental, covenantal inability rather than an arbitrary divine coercion.
 - A "union-first" account: the hypostatic union is given explanatory priority in accounting for inability rather than attributing impeccability solely to divine essence or created moral excellence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Critiques simplistic accounts that reduce impeccability to mere divine omnipotence (Christ cannot sin because he is God) as neglecting the genuine freedom and real temptations attested in Scripture.
 - Opposes readings that make Christ merely non-peccable by prerogative (absolute metaphysical impossibility) which, Johnson argues, can undermine Christ's authentic solidarity with sinners.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Introduces the term **"congruent inability"** (a non-coercive, relational inability grounded in hypostatic communion) to navigate between strict metaphysical incapacity and ordinary moral freedom.
- **Reception and influence:** Modest but growing within Reformed and evangelical seminary circles; valued as a clear corrective to both romanticized susceptibility claims and dry scholastic reductions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Useful as a bridge text for students moving from historical theology into analytic Christology; offers a usable framework for preaching on temptation, assurance, and the uniqueness of Christ's obedience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** The doctrine that Christ could not sin; here specified as a relational/moral inability grounded in the hypostatic union.
- **Peccability:** The claim that Christ could have sinned; Johnson refutes unqualified peccability while explaining how Scripture attests real temptation.
- **Hypostatic Union:** Union of divine and human natures in Christ; primary explanatory locus for Christ's inability to sin.
- **Congruent inability:** Johnson's term for a non-coercive inability arising from Christ's unique covenantal relation to the Father.
- **Metaphysical vs. moral inability:** Distinction between an ontological impossibility (absolute inability) and an inability arising from moral reality or disposition.
- **Divine impassibility / passibility:** Relative discussions on whether God can suffer; used to clarify how Christ's suffering differs from divine impassibility while preserving deity.
- **Freedom of the will (compatibilist framing):** Johnson favors a compatibilist account where genuine freedom coexists with non-occurrent proclivity against sin.
- **Temptation (real but non-triumphant):** Temptations experienced by Christ were genuine and engaging, yet did not culminate in sin due to his unique personhood.
- **Sinlessness / perfect obedience:** Ethical and soteriological necessity for penal and representative atonement.
- **Atonement implications:** Impeccability underpins penal-substitutional and representative incarnational models - Christ must be sinless to satisfy divine justice.
- **Assurance and pastoral use:** Affirms believer confidence in a flawless mediator; resources sermons on temptation and grace.
- **Exegesis model:** Methodologically mixes canonical exegesis with theological synthesis to read Hebrews, Gospels, and Pauline corpus on the issue.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for different senses of ability/impeccability in Christology classes.
- As a **polemic resource** against both minimalizing Christ's sinlessness and absolutist metaphysical accounts that deny his genuine freedom.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Hebrews and the Gospels on temptation and sinlessness.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology seminars when linking Christ's person to the efficacy of his atonement.
