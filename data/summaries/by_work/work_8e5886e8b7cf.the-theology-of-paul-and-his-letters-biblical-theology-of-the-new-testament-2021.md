### TITLE
The Theology of Paul and His Letters (Biblical Theology of the New Testament, 2021) - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2021 as part of the Biblical Theology of the New Testament series; aimed at integrating exegetical, historical, and theological readings of Pauline corpus for contemporary scholarship and ministry.
 - Situated within conservative Reformed/evangelical scholarship, engaging New Perspective on Paul (NPP) interlocutors (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) and recent canonical/biblical-theological trends.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's theology is best read as a coherent, Christ-centered answer to the problem of God's faithfulness to his promises to Israel and the inclusion of Gentiles without nullifying those promises. Romans 11 is decisive for understanding how Paul holds together election, covenant promise, and eschatological hope for Israel.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of Pauline theology organized around major motifs (gospel, justification, covenant fulfillment, eschatology, church as people of God).
 - Major moves regarding Romans 11 and Israel:
 - Close exegesis of olive-tree metaphor and "grafting" language emphasizing continuity of promise.
 - Argues for a sustained Pauline conviction that God remains faithful to his covenant pledges to Israel; present rejection is partial and remedial, not final.
 - Interprets "all Israel will be saved" as eschatological and corporate - a future ingathering that preserves both individual election (remnant) and corporate promise.
 - Balances Gentile inclusion as true incorporation into the people of God without simple replacement of Israel.
 - Uses linguistic, historical, and canonical arguments to push back on radical discontinuity readings (that see Palestine Israel as entirely superseded).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages New Perspective proponents (E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright), classical commentators (Cranfield, Barthic critics), and contemporary Pauline scholars.
 - Frequently dialogues with systematic theological categories (covenant, election) and historical-grammatical exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election and remnant theology, covenant and covenant faithfulness, Christology (as locus of fulfillment), justification by faith, ecclesiology (church as grafted olive tree), eschatology (fullness of the Gentiles and Israel's future), divine wrath and mercy.

- **Closing line**
 - Paul's theology insists that God's faithful covenant toward Israel and his embrace of Gentiles converge in Christ; Romans 11 exemplifies Paul's careful tension of continuity, judgment, and eschatological restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Persistent insistence on God's covenant faithfulness as the hermeneutical key for Paul's view of Israel's future.
 - Emphasis on corporate/representative language in Paul: promise and fulfillment operate at corporate as well as individual levels.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback on readings that either (a) treat Paul as severing Israel entirely from God's promises (replacement theology), or (b) over-transfer covenantal Israel into a merely spiritualized church without retention of historical promises.
 - Critical engagement with NPP: accepts some sociological insights but resists conclusions that minimize forensic/justification emphases or the eschatological character of "all Israel."

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines use of "remnant" language in Pauline theology as both present reality and eschatological marker; reframes "all Israel" as corporate eschatological designation rather than immediate numerical totality.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative and Reformed seminaries for exegetical clarity and pastoral usefulness.
 - Cited by those seeking a middle path between hard continuity and radical supersessionism; used in debates over Israel, church, and covenant.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for bridging detailed exegesis and systematic theology; exemplary model for reading Pauline theology with canonical sensitivity and pastoral awareness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **All Israel will be saved**
 - Treated as an eschatological, corporate promise linked to covenant faithfulness rather than simple ethnic totality.
- **Remnant**
 - Both present elect within Israel and marker of future restoration; Paul inherits and reinterprets prophetic remnant language.
- **Olive tree / grafting**
 - Image of continuity: Gentiles grafted into root (promise) that remains Israel's; emphasizes inclusion without annihilating original branches.
- **Partial hardening**
 - Temporary, purposeful judgment allowing Gentile inclusion until the eschatological turning of Israel.
- **Election**
 - Corporate and representative; individual election remains, but promises operate through corporate identity.
- **Covenant faithfulness**
 - Central explanatory principle: God's actions toward Israel and Gentiles are governed by fidelity to promises.
- **Justification**
 - Forensic, Christ-centered doctrine retained against reductive sociological readings; linked to covenantal status of God's people.
- **Eschatological fullness**
 - The "fullness of the Gentiles" marks a stage before Israel's future restoration; eschatological categories drive Paul's expectation for Israel.
- **Mercy and wrath**
 - Theological dialectic: God's present hardening is punitive yet provisional; mercy will culminate in restoration.
- **Corporate identity**
 - Emphasizes people-of-God categories rather than privatized individualism in Paul.
- **Promise to the patriarchs**
 - Seen as ongoing and determinative for Paul's theology of Israel and the church.
- **Mystery**
 - Paul's revelation that Gentiles share in promises is a realized mystery pointing to wider consummation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Romans 11 in seminarians' exegesis classes.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both replacement theology and some New Perspective excesses.
 - As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed accounts of Pauline covenant continuity and Israel's future.
