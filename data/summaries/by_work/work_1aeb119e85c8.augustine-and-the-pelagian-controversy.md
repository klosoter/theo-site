### TITLE
**Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy** - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theological scholarship; Warfield writes as a Reformed apologist and historian defending Augustine against modern misreadings and Pelagian interpreters. He reads late-antique theological conflict with historiographic care and doctrinal concern.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Augustine's treatment of **original sin, grace, and human responsibility** is both historically coherent and theologically decisive; Pelagianism and semi‑Pelagianism systematically undercut biblical anthropology and soteriology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical reconstruction of the controversy: Pelagius and Celestius - responses by Augustine, Jerome, and African synods (notably the Councils of Carthage, 418) - papal decisions.
 - Close reading of Augustine's key works (e.g., De Natura et Gratia, De Peccatorum Meritis, De Correptione et Gratia) to show Augustine's consistent framework: human inability after the Fall, necessity and priority of grace, and God's sovereign will in salvation.
 - Theological synthesis: how Augustine's doctrines safeguard divine sovereignty without obliterating moral responsibility.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Pelagius, Celestius, Julian of Eclanum, Jerome, Augustine; African bishops and synods; papal letters. Warfield uses Latin primary texts and traces interpretive history to modern rivals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **The Fall and its consequences** (transmission of sin, concupiscence, loss of freedom to do good)
 - **Grace and free will** (prevenient, efficacious grace; human inability)
 - **Predestination and reprobation** (Augustine's doctrine vis-a-vis later formulations)
 - **Soteriology, baptism (infant), merit and works**
 - **Divine foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil** (evil as privation; God's permissive will; secondary causes)
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield presents Augustine as the indispensable Christian realist: an account of sin and grace that protects divine sovereignty, explains moral culpability, and resists Pelagian optimism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Warfield stresses Augustine's realism about the Fall: sin is not merely bad example but ontological corruption requiring sovereign grace.
 - He defends Augustine against caricatures that read him as determinist by showing Augustine's persistent concern for human responsibility.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal and modern Protestant readings that minimize original sin or over-privilege human will; contrasts Augustine with Pelagius (moralist-optimism) and with later semi‑Pelagian mitigations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Warfield frames Augustine as providing a coherent set of theological diagnostics: incapacity (not just guilt), necessity of efficacious grace, and a moral account of responsibility compatible with divine foreknowledge.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; used as a key apologetic defense of Augustinian doctrines at Princeton and beyond; shaped 20th-century treatments of sin and grace.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous historical-theological recovery of a church father; supplies a durable template for teaching original sin, grace, and the interface of providence and evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**
 - Transmission of Adam's fallen state; basis for universal human incapacity to achieve salvific good unaided.
- **Concupiscence**
 - Disordered appetite/sentiment post-Fall; Warfield follows Augustine in distinguishing inclination from culpability while maintaining pervasive corruption.
- **Human inability**
 - Emphasizes impotence to will and do supernatural good apart from grace.
- **Prevenient / efficacious grace**
 - Grace precedes and secures conversion; Warfield underscores Augustine's claim that grace effects what it intends.
- **Predestination**
 - Divine election rooted in grace; Warfield highlights Augustine's careful (if not systematized) affirmations of sovereign choice.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Pelagianism: moralism and denial of inherited corruption. Semi‑Pelagianism: mitigated human initiative. Warfield treats both as threats to biblical soteriology.
- **Imputation**
 - Guilt and/or corruption of Adam reckoned to posterity; central to Augustine as read by Warfield.
- **Infant baptism**
 - Pastoral and theological practice grounded in doctrine of original sin and need for grace.
- **Divine foreknowledge**
 - God's exhaustive knowledge compatible with human responsibility in Augustine's framework; Warfield uses Augustine to resist fatalism.
- **Providence / Problem of evil**
 - Evil as privation; God permits moral evil through secondary causes while remaining sovereign and good.
- **Merit vs. grace**
 - Human deeds cannot merit initial salvation; later rewards ordered under grace.
- **Secondary causes**
 - Creatures act legitimately though under divine governance - key to Augustine's theodicy as defended by Warfield.
- **Responsibility vs. inability**
 - Distinction used to rebut charge that Augustine denies moral accountability.
- **Augustinian method**
 - Close exegesis of Paul, theological reading of history, synthesis of pastoral concern and doctrinal precision.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for doctrines of original sin and grace in systematic theology courses.
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies in pastoral and doctrinal debates.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Augustine on Romans and the Pauline corpus.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology and providence/theodicy in Reformed teaching.
