### TITLE
Resurrection (De Resurrectione), Disputed Questions - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Thirteenth-century scholasticism; Dominican lecturing and disputation culture (circa 1260s). Aquinas synthesizes **Aristotelian metaphysics** with **Augustinian** and patristic exegesis in formal disputed questions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To demonstrate coherently how the Christian doctrine of the **resurrection of the body** is metaphysically intelligible, scripturally warranted, and necessary for final beatitude and divine justice.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Establishes that human persons are hylomorphic composites (soul = substantial form of body) and so the resurrection must restore the composite, not merely an immortal soul.
 - Shows that **divine omnipotence** can reconstitute the same human body even when its matter is dispersed or transformed; hence numerical identity is preserved by the continuing soul and God's power.
 - Explains the necessity of bodily resurrection for *beatific union* and the vindication of moral justice (the body participates in glory and in punishment).
 - Describes properties of the **glorified/risen body** (impassibility, subtility, agility, luminosity/clarity) and how these are compatible with continuity of identity.
 - Treats subsidiary questions: timing of resurrection, the case of annihilated matter, Christ as firstfruits and cause of others' resurrection, intermediate state of souls.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Uses **Aristotle** (hylomorphism), **Augustine**, Gregory, Jerome, and the Sentences glosses; answers objections from Averroists and more Platonic dualists.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, anthropology (soul-body relation), Christology (Christ's resurrection as exemplar and efficient/meritorious cause), soteriology, divine omnipotence and justice.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas makes resurrection intelligible by fusing a robust metaphysical account of personal identity with theological claims: the same human subject, sustained by the soul and God's power, will receive a transformed but continuous bodily life fit for eternal beatitude.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic use of **hylomorphism** to underpin eschatology: the soul is the persistent principle securing personal identity in resurrection.
 - Stress on **continuity + transfiguration**: sameness of person together with genuine qualitative change (glorification).
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects Platonic or purely spiritualist readings that separate eternal life from bodily existence; corrects crude materialist accounts by insisting on the soul as form and on divine power to restore identity.
 - Responds to Averroist worries about individuation by locating numerical identity primarily in the subsisting soul acting on matter.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Technical articulation of **resurrection identity** without requiring persistence of identical particles; introduces practical criteria (soul as formal principle; God's power) for numerical sameness.
 - Clear categorization of the **qualities of the glorified body** (impassibility, subtility, agility, clarity).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Roman Catholic systematic theology and formation; widely read in late medieval and early modern scholastic curricula.
 - Influenced Protestant debates by offering a rigorous philosophical model-Reformers accepted the doctrine but often rejected Thomistic metaphysical specifics; later Protestant theologians engaged Thomistic categories selectively.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model for integrating Scripture, patristic authority, and metaphysics; indispensable for teaching on Christian anthropology, eschatology, and the coherence of bodily resurrection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection of the body** - the reconstitution of the embodied human person for final beatitude and judgment.
- **Soul as substantial form** - the soul is the principle that actualizes and individuates the body; it persists and grounds personal identity.
- **Hylomorphism** - Aristotelian account used to explain composite human nature and the necessity of bodily resurrection.
- **Numerical identity** - preserved across death by the subsisting soul and divine power; does not require identical physical particles.
- **First matter vs. matter of the body** - distinction used to show God can gather original matter or generate suitable matter to restore identity.
- **Divine omnipotence (recreative gathering)** - God's power to reassemble dispersed matter or create fitting matter secures resurrection.
- **Christ as firstfruits and cause** - Christ's resurrection is exemplar and meritorious cause of the resurrection of others.
- **Glorified body qualities**
 - **Impassibility** - freedom from suffering.
 - **Subtility** - penetrative, nonordinary materiality.
 - **Agility** - instantaneous movement not subject to ordinary physical limits.
 - **Clarity (luminosity)** - participation in divine radiance.
- **Intermediate state** - condition of separated souls prior to general resurrection; incomplete beatitude without bodily reunion.
- **Final beatitude / union** - full flourishing requiring embodied participation in God's presence.
- **Moral/eschatological necessity** - resurrection vindicates justice and completes redemption.
- **Scriptural-patristic synthesis** - method of harmonizing biblical testimony and patristic doctrine with metaphysical reasoning.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what constitutes a Christian doctrine of bodily resurrection (Catholic dogmatic formulations).
- As a **polemic resource** against both dualistic spiritualism and reductive materialism.
- As an **exegetical-philosophical model** for reading Pauline and patristic texts on resurrection and eternal life.
- As a **conceptual pivot** connecting anthropology, Christology, and eschatology in systematic theology.
