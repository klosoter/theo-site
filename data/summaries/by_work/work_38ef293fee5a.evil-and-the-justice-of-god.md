### TITLE
Evil and the Justice of God - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Published in the early 21st century amid renewed evangelical interest in eschatology, historical Jesus studies, and critique of abstract theodicies. Wright writes from an Anglican, historically grounded Pauline and prophetic perspective; addresses both academic and church audiences.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Evil must be judged and overcome within God's covenantal, eschatological plan; theodicy requires attention to cosmic restoration and public divine justice, not merely private consolation or abstract metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: traditional theodicies (abstract moral arguments, soul-making, private consolation) fail because they sideline covenant, incarnation, and resurrection.
 - Biblical reorientation: Scripture presents evil as covenant-breaking that God will publicly judge and finally rectify through Christ's death, resurrection, and the new creation.
 - Justice reframed: God's justice is both forensic (judicial vindication) and restorative (new creation), culminating in God declaring righteousness over creation in the Final Judgment and New Heavens/New Earth.
 - Pastoral implication: Hope is rooted in God's promises and eschatological action, not speculative metaphysics about intermediate states.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive biblical exegesis (Paul, Isaiah, Revelation); interlocutors include classical theodicy literature, process theology, some modern philosophers of religion, and interpreters who emphasize individualistic afterlife models. Wright interacts with Augustine/Irenaeus traditions implicitly by recovering eschatological strands.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant, Trinity (as actor in redemption), Christology (incarnation, atonement), resurrection, eschatology (individual and cosmic), sin and the Fall, judgment, new creation.
- **Closing line:** Wright centers theodicy within God's covenantal action culminating in Christ's vindication and the renewal of creation - evil is addressed by God's public, restorative judgment and the inauguration of the new heavens and new earth (see New Heavens And New Earth; Final Judgment And Eternal States; Individual And Cosmic Eschatology; The Fall And Its Consequences).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Treats evil primarily as covenant-breach and cosmic disorder rather than merely moral problem for indivual souls.
 - Emphasizes the **public, forensic character of divine judgment** - God's vindication of victims and condemnation of wickedness.
 - Marries **judicial** and **restorative** models: punishment serves God's aim to renew creation, not merely retributive satisfaction.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Critiques abstract theodicies (e.g., purely philosophical defenses, sentimental platitudes) for neglecting biblical narrative and eschatology.
 - Counters overly individualistic afterlife theology by restoring corporate, cosmic eschatology - salvation involves bodies, nations, and cosmos.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "justice" as covenantal rectification enacted and demonstrated in history (especially in the cross and resurrection).
 - Uses "vindication" language to describe eschatological outcomes instead of mere metaphysical compensation.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely read among evangelicals and mainline scholars; praised for biblically rooted reorientation of theodicy and eschatology. Critics raise concerns about downplaying traditional penal substitution nuances or about ambitious exegetical claims. Influential for sermons, pastoral theology, and scholarly debate on theodicy and new creation.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a structured, scripturally anchored alternative to purely philosophical theodicies; supplies a usable model for integrating Christology, judgment, and cosmic eschatology in teaching and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant-breach:** Evil as rupture of God's covenant order; frames sin as political/corporate treason rather than only private moral failing.
- **Vindication:** God's public declaration of righteousness for victims and condemnation for perpetrators; central to Final Judgment And Eternal States.
- **New Creation / New Heavens and New Earth:** The goal of God's justice; restoration of cosmos, bodies, and social order (see New Heavens And New Earth).
- **Resurrection:** Proof of God's decisive action; guarantees bodily renewal and anchors Individual And Cosmic Eschatology.
- **Forensic justice:** Judicial aspect of God's action - trial, verdict, public declaration - combined with restorative aims.
- **Restorative justice:** God's renewing action that repairs creation's harms; emphasizes transformation over mere retribution.
- **The Fall:** Covenantal catastrophe whose consequences are cosmic disorder and human complicity (see The Fall And Its Consequences).
 - Sub-note: Wright stresses historical/ontological consequences, not only metaphorical ¶
- **Eschatological judgment:** Judgment as future, historical, and cosmic - decisive end to evil and vindication of God's justice.
- **Cosmic eschatology:** Salvation extends to nations, creation, and history (see Individual And Cosmic Eschatology).
- **Representative atonement:** Wright affirms penal elements but emphasizes representative, covenantal dimensions rather than simple substitutionary formulas.
- **Public theology:** Theology aimed at communal witness and social transformation; embedded in Wright's stress on visible kingdom.
- **Narrative-theodicy:** Using biblical story (fall, exile, cross, resurrection, new creation) as the theological framework for addressing evil.
- **Judicial-restorative synthesis:** Key methodological pivot in the work; integrates both paradigms to avoid one-sided solutions.
- **Hope as promise-fulfillment:** Christian hope grounded in God's promises fulfilled in Christ and consummated in the new creation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading judgment and new creation passages in Scripture.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theodicy courses, shifting attention from private suffering to covenantal and cosmic dimensions.
 - As **polemic** against abstract philosophical theodicies and individualistic afterlife doctrines.
 - As a **definition source** for integrating restorative and forensic accounts of divine justice in pastoral theology.
