### TITLE
On Ockham's Way Out (Faith and Philosophy, 1986) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1980s analytic-theological debate on divine foreknowledge and human freedom; follows Plantinga's free will defense (1974) and contemporaneous Molinist revival.
 - Engages medieval scholastic legacy (William of Ockham) and modern analytic modal logic.

- **Central thesis**
 - Ockham's proposed escape from the incompatibility of divine foreknowledge and libertarian freedom (the "way out") fails: it either collapses into fatalism or undermines essential attributes of God (omniscience/sovereignty) and does not supply a viable account of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs Ockhamist strategy: deny that divine foreknowledge entails metaphysical necessity of future free acts by distinguishing types of necessity and insisting that future contingent truths obtain only if the free act occurs (i.e., God's knowledge depends on the act).
 - Modal-logical critique:
 - Shows that if God infallibly knows p (where p is a future free act), then p is metaphysically necessary relative to God's knowledge, creating an incompatibilist threat.
 - Argues Ockham's move-treating necessity as a mere "necessity of the consequent"-does not dissolve the problem because it leaves fixed, non-revisable truth-values that constrain freedom.
 - Theological costs:
 - If divine knowledge is made dependent on creaturely acts, God's aseity and providential sovereignty are compromised.
 - Alternatively, if God is made timeless or knowledge is reinterpreted, other problems (e.g., correlation with temporal order, accountability for evil) remain.
 - Comparative note: Molinism (middle knowledge) offers an alternative by locating truth in counterfactuals known prior to divine decree; Plantinga examines tensions and trade-offs between Ockhamist and Molinist moves.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - William of Ockham (primary target), scholastics broadly, contemporary analytic defenders of libertarian freedom and Molinists (e.g., Luis Molina tradition), and modern philosophers of religion working on providence and foreknowledge.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine foreknowledge, omniscience, providence, human libertarian freedom, theodicy/free will defense, modal metaphysics of necessity and contingency.

- **Closing line**
 - Plantinga locates the theological center of gravity in the incompatibility: Ockham's attempt to preserve both divine foreknowledge and libertarian freedom by ad hoc modal distinctions fails; a viable theistic account must either reconceive divine knowledge (e.g., middle knowledge) or accept serious theological costs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous modal-logical reconstruction of a medieval solution to a modern problem; emphasizes the interplay of logic and theological attribute-concepts rather than purely historical or exegetical matters.
 - Places weight on theological costs (aseity, providence) as decisive, not merely formal logical paradoxes.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges scholastic voluntarist readings that treat Ockham as having simply dodged fatalism; shows such readings either covertly accept fatalism or make God dependent.
 - Contrasts with Molinist approaches by showing why Ockhamism is not simply an alternative neutral move but a choice with distinct metaphysical-theological trade-offs.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of contemporary modal vocabulary to translate scholastic distinctions (necessity of the consequent, conditional dependence) into present-day analytic terms.
 - Clarifies the role of counterfactuals of freedom in adjudicating foreknowledge accounts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in debates over foreknowledge and freedom; reinforced analytic suspicion of Ockhamist solutions in philosophy of religion.
 - Prompted more sustained defenses of Molinism and further refinement of the free will defense in contemporary theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for combining historical-theological sensitivity with modal analysis.
 - Useful corrective to attempts to salvage libertarian freedom by purely nominal modal moves; remains a staple reference in courses on divine foreknowledge and providence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ockhamism / Ockham's way out** - the strategy of denying that divine foreknowledge of future free acts entails their metaphysical necessity by making God's knowledge dependent on the acts.
- **Necessity of the consequent** - Ockham's distinction that an apparent necessity resulting from God's knowledge is not prior metaphysical necessity; Plantinga shows this is insufficient to secure freedom.
- **Foreknowledge** - divine infallible knowledge of future truths; focal point of the incompatibilist tension with libertarian freedom.
- **Libertarian freedom** - the thesis that human agents could have done otherwise in genuine alternative possibilities; treated as the standard of freedom Plantinga defends.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - statements about what a free agent would do in possible circumstances; crucial to Molinist alternatives and problematic for Ockhamism.
- **Middle knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of counterfactuals prior to divine decree; presented as a competing solution to preserve both omniscience and libertarian freedom.
 - Relation: Plantinga examines Molinism as a more promising but contested alternative to Ockhamism.
- **Divine aseity** - God's independence; invoked to show theological cost if God's knowledge depends on creatures.
- **Providence** - God's governance; used to assess whether Ockhamism yields a coherent doctrine of providential control.
- **Modal entailment / modal logic** - analytic tools used to expose hidden necessities introduced by foreknowledge.
- **Voluntarism** - theological tendency stressing divine will priority; Ockhamist move is a form of voluntarism critiqued by Plantinga.
- **Fatalism** - the unwanted consequence Plantinga argues Ockhamism flirts with if modal constraints are accepted.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against Ockhamist defenses of freedom and foreknowledge, showing their modal insufficiency.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates: motivates deeper engagement with middle knowledge and counterfactuals in articulating providence and the free will defense.
