### TITLE
**First Theology: God, Scripture & Hermeneutics** - Kevin J. Vanhoozer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-modern to postmodern hermeneutical debates (1980s-2002), evangelical and Reformed retrieval mood; engages postliberalism, deconstruction, reader-response, and analytic philosophy of language.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Theology is first and foremost about the triune God who speaks; Scripture is the divinely authorized medium of that communicative action. Hermeneutics is therefore a theological task: to hear, understand, and obey the illocutions of God in Scripture within the economy of revelation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Rehabilitate **authorial discourse** against radical reader-centered theories using **speech-act theory**: God, as triune author, performs communicative actions through the canon.
 - Clarify **principia of theology**: principium cognoscendi externum (Scripture) and internum (Spirit), reframed as communicative presence and illumination.
 - Articulate **theological interpretation** that honors the canon, the rule of faith, and ecclesial reception without collapsing into either foundationalism or relativism.
 - Propose **incarnational and accommodative** analogies for Scripture's divine-human ontology; resist reduction to either mere human text or timeless oracle.
 - Map **doctrine** as direction for fitting participation in God's communicative economy, anticipating the later theodramatic model.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Augustine, Calvin, Bavinck; Barth on analogy and self-attestation; Pannenberg and Torrance; Gadamer and Ricoeur on interpretation; Derrida and Fish as foils; Lindbeck and postliberalism; analytic speech-act theorists (Austin, Searle).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (general and special), Scripture and canon, Trinity and divine speech, accommodation, ecclesial authority, theological method, epistemology of faith.
- **Closing line:** First theology centers on the triune God who addresses the church through Scripture, summoning understanding, trust, and obedient performance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Triune communicative action:** Scripture as the medium of the Father's address in the Son through the Spirit.
 - **Speech-act hermeneutics:** Illocutions as the primary unit of meaning and authority; perlocutions as sanctifying ends.
 - **Canonical-linguistic posture:** Normative canonical forms shape doctrine and discipleship.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **strong reader-response** and deconstruction: meaning is not limitless differance; God can intend determinate communicative acts.
 - Against **naive foundationalism:** adopts a chastened or sapiential realism; confidence grounded in God's promise and Spirit, not autonomous reason.
 - Against **solo Scriptura:** retrieves **Sola Scriptura** within the church, rule of faith, and communion of saints.
 - Tilts toward **analogia fidei** over **analogia entis**, while acknowledging creaturely correspondence under revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **First theology** as God-and-Scripture hermeneutical prolegomena.
 - **Authorial discourse ontology:** the God who speaks is the ontological ground of textual meaning.
 - Use of **accommodation** and **incarnational analogy** to describe Scripture's form.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Catalyzed evangelical retrieval of theological interpretation of Scripture; bridge to The Drama of Doctrine and Remythologizing Theology.
 - Cited in debates on inerrancy, canon, and the authority of authorial intent; engaged by Reformed scholastic retrievals of principia.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A durable map for integrating bibliology, Trinity, and hermeneutics.
 - Pedagogically useful for courses on theological method, Scripture, and postmodernity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **First theology:** Prolegomena that begin with God's self-communication and Scripture as its privileged medium.
- **Principia of theology:** 
 - **Externum:** Scripture as external cognitive principle.
 - **Internum:** Spirit's illumination as internal cognitive principle.
- **Speech-act theory:** Distinguishes locution, illocution, perlocution; used to model divine commands, promises, warnings in Scripture.
- **Authorial intent:** The triune God's communicative intention mediated by human authors; resists reader-only meaning.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture:** Scripture bears God's authority intrinsically; recognized by the Spirit in the church.
- **Accommodation:** God fits his speech to creaturely capacities; analogically linked to the incarnation.
- **Incarnational analogy:** Scripture is fully divine and fully human without confusion or division.
- **Theological interpretation:** Reading within the rule of faith and the canon's final form for the church's understanding and obedience.
- **Analogia fidei vs. analogia entis:** Prioritizes knowledge of God by faith through revelation over metaphysical continuity claims.
- **General and special revelation:** General as creational signs; special as covenantal discourse culminating in Christ and Scripture.
- **Critical or sapiential realism:** Epistemic posture combining humility with confidence in God's communicative fidelity.
- **Sola Scriptura vs. solo Scriptura:** Scripture as supreme norm within ecclesial tradition, not isolation from it.
- **Biblical vs. systematic theology:** Distinct yet interdependent; ST organizes the canon's communicative acts theologically.
- **Canon and authority:** Canon's final form is the normative context for discerning divine illocutions.

- **How this work is used:**
 - As a **definition source** for principia, self-attestation, accommodation, and theological interpretation.
 - As a **methodological pivot** integrating speech-act hermeneutics with Reformed bibliology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against deconstruction and against solo Scriptura.
 - As an **exegetical-model primer** for reading Scripture as triune communicative action across loci.
