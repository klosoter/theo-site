### TITLE
The Reformed View - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Covenant Theology: Biblical, Theological, and Historical Perspectives (2020)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary Reformed revival (late 20th-early 21st c.) addressing renewed interest in covenantal schemas. Published amid debates over covenant continuity/ discontinuity (Reformed vs. New Covenant Theology vs. dispensationalism). Ferguson writes from conservative Presbyterian/Reformed pastoral-theological vantage.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** 
 - The classical Reformed account grounds the unity and diversity of redemptive history in a real, intra-Trinitarian Covenant of Redemption, which secures Christ's mediatorial work and undergirds the Covenant of Grace as its outworking in history.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Affirm a threefold covenantal pattern: Covenant of Redemption (intra-Trinitarian pact), Covenant of Works (pre-fall administration with Adam), Covenant of Grace (post-fall administration realized in Christ). 
 - Show how the Covenant of Redemption is not anachronistic speculation but theologically necessary to explain Christ's suretyship, the eternal counsel of the Trinity, and historical covenant administrations. 
 - Relate covenant theology to Scripture, systematic loci (Trinity, Christology, soteriology), and pastoral praxis (sacraments, preaching, assurance).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Draws on classical Reformed sources (Westminster divines, Calvinic tradition), and modern Reformed theologians who defended federal theology (e.g., John Owen, Geerhardus Vos, John Murray). Contrasts Reformed federalism with New Covenant Theology and dispensational critiques.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Trinity:** intra-Trinitarian agreements and perichoretic relations as basis for promise/fulfillment. 
 - **Christology:** person and work of Christ as the surety and mediator. 
 - **Soteriology:** covenantal structure of redemption, imputation, and substitution. 
 - **Covenant theology proper:** distinctions and unity among covenants; covenant administration and sacraments. 
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacramentology:** implications for baptism, covenant children, and continuity of covenant community.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - The Reformed view places the Covenant of Redemption at the heart of redemptive history: an eternal, Trinitarian coordination that secures Christ's mediatorial work and preserves the unity of the Covenant of Grace across Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong pastoral and Christocentric reading: covenant theology presented not merely as doctrine but as grammar for preaching, assurance, and sacramental life. 
 - Emphasis on the Covenant of Redemption as both doctrinally necessary and pastorally fruitful.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects legalistic or static renderings of covenants by insisting on covenantal dynamism rooted in Trinitarian relations. 
 - Pushes back against New Covenant Theology and dispensationalism by defending continuity of covenant promises and the mediatorial continuity in Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies language distinguishing covenant essence (what God purposed) from covenant administration (how promises are mediated historically), reducing confusion about covenant "changes." 
 - Reframes Covenant of Redemption as an interpretive key rather than a speculative metaphysical contrivance.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Reinforces a mainstream Reformed consensus in academic and pastoral circles; widely cited in seminary teaching and Reformed pastoral formation. 
 - Valued by those seeking a robust integration of Trinitarian theology with covenantal soteriology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Succinct, pastorally-minded articulation that aids preaching, catechesis, and sacramental practice; serves as a reliable corrective to fragmented covenant schemas.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Redemption:** The intra-Trinitarian agreement by which the Father, Son, and Spirit ordain the Son's mediatorial work; the theological ground of the Covenant of Grace. 
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre-fall covenant with Adam, covenantal principle of law and probation. 
- **Covenant of Grace:** The post-fall administration of God's saving promise fulfilled in Christ. 
- **Suretyship:** Christ's legal and relational role as substitute and representative for the elect within the Covenant of Redemption. 
- **Federal Headship:** The principle that one representative (Adam/Christ) stands for many, structuring imputation and solidarity. 
- **Administration vs. Essence (of covenant):** 
 - *Essence:* the unchanging divine purpose (e.g., covenant promises). 
 - *Administration:* historical forms and signs (sacraments, administrations) by which that purpose is applied. 
- **Typology / Promise-Fulfillment:** The interpretive link between Old Testament types and New Testament fulfillment in Christ. 
- **Mediatorial Kingship:** Christ's office exercised as covenant mediator-prophet, priest, king-within the covenantal plan. 
- **Sacramental Sign/Seal:** Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal marks that connect believers and children to covenant promises. 
- **Continuity of Covenants:** The Reformed insistence that covenants reveal a single redemptive plan rather than disjointed economies. 
- **Intra-Trinitarian Pact:** Terminology emphasizing relational, eternal decision within the Trinity for redemption. 
- **Imputation (Legal):** Transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers based on covenantal representation. 
- **Covenant Community:** The ecclesial outworking of covenant promises across generations (family and church).

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a concise definition source for the Covenant of Redemption in textbooks and lectures. 
 - As a polemical resource against New Covenant Theology and dispensational fragmentation. 
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model linking Trinitarian theology, Christology, and sacramental practice in preaching and catechesis.
