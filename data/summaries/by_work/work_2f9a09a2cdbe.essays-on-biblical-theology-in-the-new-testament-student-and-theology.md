### TITLE
Essays on Biblical Theology (in The New Testament Student and Theology) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed milieu; Van Til writing as a systematic and apologetic theologian addressing biblical-theological method within conservative Protestant scholarship.
 - Reaction against abstracted scholastic systems and neutral philosophical approaches to theology; interaction with contemporaneous confessional and historical-critical currents.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be rooted in the concrete, historical acts of God (historia salutis) rather than reduced to an abstract, logical sequence of soteriological propositions (ordo salutis). Biblical theology is prior to and corrective of systematics that abstract Christ and salvation into disembodied schemata.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation that revelation is fundamentally Christocentric and historical: God acts in covenantal history; Scripture reports those acts, and theology must start there.
 - Critique of ordo salutis as a methodological and pastoral error when it is treated as the primary hermeneutical key; such a usage inverts redemptive-historical priority by treating salvific stages as conceptual categories rather than acts.
 - Proposal of a covenantal-historical method:
 - Read Scripture as unified redemptive history centered on the person and work of Christ.
 - Let theological ordering serve the historical narrative, not the reverse.
 - Implications for apologetics and doctrine: the knowledge of God and the human response must be intelligible only within the framework of God's saving acts and covenantal revelation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit dialogue with scholastic Reformed treatments that formalize ordo salutis.
 - Contrast to liberal theological tendencies that sever doctrine from redemptive acts; engagement with broader Reformed tradition (e.g., Calvinian covenant motifs) and contemporary systematic method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (primacy of redemptive-historical revelation)
 - Soteriology (historia vs ordo)
 - Covenant theology (as structuring principle)
 - Christology (Christ as center of history)
 - Scripture and hermeneutics (redemptive-historical reading)
 - Apologetics (presuppositional implications)

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til locates the heart of biblical theology in the historical acts of God-Christocentric, covenantal events that orient and constrain doctrinal ordering-insisting that faithful theology serves the narrative of salvation rather than reconstructing it as a priori logical stages.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the primacy of historia salutis as the decisive hermeneutical and theological principle.
 - Integration of apologology with redemptive-historical method: revelation's historical acts provide the presuppositional ground for knowledge and faith.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects scholastic ordo-centered soteriology that abstracts salvation into a sequence divorced from covenantal-historical context.
 - Opposes any theological method that privileges logical system over the biblical narrative of God's saving acts.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Rearticulation of the historia vs ordo distinction in service of a presuppositional, covenantal theology.
 - Emphasis that "order" in theology must be servant to redeeming events rather than the master ordering them.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars who emphasize redemptive-historical preaching and covenantal exegesis.
 - Contributed to the development of Van Tilian presuppositionalism by grounding epistemology in redemptive history; used as a corrective by those suspicious of abstract systematicism.
 - Criticized by those who defend a more formalized ordo salutis as necessary for doctrinal clarity and pastoral application.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies methodological priorities for soteriology and hermeneutics.
 - Valuable for preachers, exegetes, and theologians seeking to keep doctrine tethered to biblical events and covenantal structure.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historia Salutis**
 - The sequence of God's redemptive acts in history; the primary datum for biblical theology.

- **Ordo Salutis**
 - The logical or systematic sequence of soteriological concepts (election, calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification); critiqued when given priority over historia.

- **Christocentric Revelation**
 - The claim that revelation is centered on Christ's person and work as the decisive historical act.

- **Covenantal-Historical Method**
 - Reading Scripture as a covenantal narrative; theological ordering is derived from and subordinate to this narrative.

- **Presuppositional Grounding**
 - Using redemptive acts as the presuppositions for knowledge, faith, and apologetic engagement.

- **Antithesis**
 - The epistemic and moral divide between regenerate and unregenerate thought-used to argue that theology presuppositions matter.

- **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutic**
 - Exegetical approach that emphasizes typology, fulfillment, and covenant continuity across Scripture.

- **Logical Order vs Chronological Order**
 - Distinction between conceptual/systematic sequencing (ordo) and the actual historical sequence of God's acts (historia).

- **Typology**
 - Interpretation of Old Testament persons/events as historical foreshadows fulfilled in Christ.

- **Revelational Primacy**
 - The priority of God's self-revelation (acts) over human philosophical constructions.

- **Divine Decree and Action**
 - Emphasis that divine decree is manifest in covenantal acts which Scripture records as history.

- **Apologetic Implication**
 - The claim that true apologetics must begin with God's acts as the presupposed reality.

- **Exegetical Model**
 - Redemptive-historical reading used as the normative model for preaching and doctrine.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source emphasizing that biblical theology should prioritize historia salutis over abstract ordo treatments.
- As a polemic against scholastic/systematic reductions of soteriology and against attempts to secularize theological method.
- As an exegetical model for redemptive-historical preaching and for linking Christology, covenant, and soteriology in teaching and sermon formation.
