### TITLE
The Man Christ Jesus: Theological Reflections on the Humanity of Christ - Bruce A. Ware

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century within contemporary evangelical and Reformed scholarship (Crossway). Ware writes as a conservative Reformed systematic theologian addressing renewed interest in the concrete, experiential dimensions of Christ's humanity amid debates over freedom, will, and temptation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus is genuinely and fully human in every respect proper to human nature while at the same time **impeccable** (sinless and not able to sin). Ware defends that the true humanity of Christ does not entail peccability; rather, the hypostatic union secures both authentic human experience and moral non‑culpability.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful readings of Gospel temptations, prayer, growth, suffering, and hunger to establish authentic human experience.
 - Philosophical-theological move: analysis of human freedom and will (distinguishing compatibilist accounts from libertarian/social models) to show how genuine human choices can coexist with an inability to sin.
 - Christological synthesis: the **hypostatic union**, the presence of the Spirit, and filial obedience ground Jesus' intrinsic holiness and prevent moral failure without denying his human vulnerability.
 - Soteriological implication: Christ's non‑peccability preserves the efficacy of his active obedience and the validity of his representative work as Federal Head for believers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to classical creeds (Chalcedon), patristic and Reformed traditions; engages contemporary interlocutors who argue for Christ's peccability or for a libertarian account of freedom in the incarnate life.
 - Interfaces with philosophical accounts of freedom and recent evangelical scholarship on kenosis and the experiences of Jesus.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, person and natures), Trinity (implications of the divine-human union), soteriology (active and passive obedience), anthropology (human will and experience), Spirit Christology (role of Spirit in sanctification of the incarnate Son).
- **Closing line**
 - Ware centers a paradox as doctrinal lynchpin: the Son is *truly human in experience and capacity* yet, by virtue of his divine person and Spirit‑filled obedience, **not a sinner nor able to sin**, thereby securing both the integrity of the incarnation and the foundation of atonement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that authenticity of human experience (e.g., exhaustion, grief, temptation) does not imply moral fallibility; Jesus' experiences are genuine yet morally pristine.
 - A systematic link between the hypostatic union and the metaphysical ground for non‑peccability-Ware argues that divine‑human personal unity can coherently account for an inability to sin.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against accounts that grant Jesus a libertarian power to sin (peccability), arguing those accounts unintentionally undercut the soteriological necessity of a sinless representative.
 - Counters over‑radical kenotic readings that treat the Son as functionally divested of essentials of deity in the incarnation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful operational distinctions between *impeccability* (sinlessness and inability to sin), *peccability* (capacity to sin), and related freedom vocabularies (compatibilist human freedom vs. libertarian power).
 - Framing of the Spirit's role as the inner dynamism that secures Christ's holy human responses without making them merely passive or non‑human.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise, readable case for classical non‑peccability; cited in pastoral and seminary contexts when defending orthodox Christology.
 - Stimulated renewed debate with scholars who favor a stronger emphasis on moral contingency in the incarnate life.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, robust model for integrating biblical exegesis, philosophical reflection on freedom, and classical Christology; valuable for teaching on incarnation, temptation, and atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability**
 - Sinlessness of Christ; Ware often stresses that this includes an effective **inability** to sin grounded in the hypostatic union.
- **Peccability**
 - The claim that Christ could have sinned; Ware critiques this as theologically destabilizing for soteriology.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - The personal union of divine and human natures in the one Person of the Son; central explanatory device for non‑peccability.
- **Kenosis / self‑emptying**
 - Treated carefully: Ware affirms voluntary humility and functional submission without ontological loss of deity.
- **Human will (Christ's human will)**
 - Real and operative; Ware explains how a genuine human will can be non‑fallen and oriented by the divine will.
- **Freedom (compatibilist vs. libertarian)**
 - Ware leans on a compatibilist framework to allow authentic human choice without conceding libertarian power to sin.
- **Temptation**
 - Biblically examined as genuine solicitation without resulting moral culpability-supports authenticity plus sinlessness.
- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Active obedience (perfect law‑keeping) and passive obedience (suffering/death) are both secured by Christ's sinlessness.
- **Spirit Christology**
 - Role of the Holy Spirit in enabling Christ's holy human responses; not separable from the person of the Son.
- **Representative / Federal Head**
 - Christ's sinless humanity is necessary for him to serve as the federal head of redeemed humanity.
- **Soteriological efficacy**
 - Non‑peccability described as a condition for the validity of atonement and imputed righteousness.
- **Authentic human experience**
 - Emphasis that feelings, growth, and suffering in Christ are real and not merely apparitional.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical formulations of impeccability and non‑peccability.
 - As a **polemic** against peccability proposals and overly kenotic accounts that risk undermining atonement.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading temptation narratives and passages on Christ's growth and dependence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminars on christology and pastoral theology to secure Christ's representative role.
