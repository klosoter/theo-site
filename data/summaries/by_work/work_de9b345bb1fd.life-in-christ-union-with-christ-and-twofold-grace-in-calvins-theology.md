### TITLE
Life in Christ: Union with Christ and Twofold Grace in Calvin's Theology - Mark A. Garcia

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary scholarly reappraisal of Calvin within late 20th-21st century Reformed studies.
 - Engages both historical-theological method and constructive retrieval for systematic theology; addresses debates over imputation vs. participation.
 - Aimed at advanced students, pastors, and scholars clarifying Calvin's soteriology and sacramental theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin's soteriology is best understood through the doctrine of **union with Christ**, and this union yields a **twofold grace**: a forensic, declarative dimension and a real, participatory transformative dimension. These are distinct yet inseparable in Calvin's account of salvation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Calvin's language of being "in Christ" across Institutes, commentaries, and sermons.
 - Historical delineation of how Calvin inherits and reshapes medieval, Lutheran, and Reformed motifs (imputation, participation, covenant).
 - Systematic mapping: how **justification** (forensic declaration) and **sanctification/participation** (actual communion and moral transformation) derive from the believer's union with Christ.
 - Analysis of mediating instruments: Word, sacraments, and the Spirit as the bond enabling participation.
 - Response to modern caricatures that reduce Calvin to an imputation-only account; demonstration of a coherent twofold model.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, sermons).
 - Interlocutors: medieval scholasticism, Lutheran participationism, Osiander-type debates, later Reformed writers (post-Calvin orthodoxians).
 - Contemporary scholarship on covenant theology, forensic/personal union debates.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Union with Christ (central)
 - Justification (forensic imputation)
 - Sanctification (participation, progressive sanctity)
 - Christology (active/passive obedience; mediatorial office)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as bond and efficient cause)
 - Sacramental theology (Word and sacrament as means of union)
 - Covenant theology and legal/moral dimensions of salvation

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Calvin's gospel is fundamentally Christocentric: believers are saved because, and as, they are truly united to Christ - a union that both declares them righteous and progressively makes them so.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Twofold grace** formulation - explicit pairing of forensic declaration and real participation as complementary results of union.
 - Emphasis on the Spirit as the ontological bond, not merely a witness to legal status.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters readings that isolate Calvin as an imputation-only theologian by showing his robust participation language.
 - Distinguishes Calvin from Lutheran "ubiquity/real presence" debates and from Osiander-style notions that reduce justification to inner righteousness alone.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes longstanding terms (imputation, infusion, participation) in a way that preserves forensic categories while validating real communion without collapsing one into the other.
 - Clarifies the instrumental role of Word and sacrament as constitutive for union rather than merely confirmatory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in contemporary Reformed scholarship that seeks a more holistic reading of Calvin.
 - Used in ecumenical conversations to bridge Reformed and Lutheran emphases on forensic and participatory elements.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a concise hermeneutic for reading Calvin across genres.
 - Useful corrective to polarizing historiographies; aids preachers and teachers in presenting a balanced Reformed soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - central relational reality making all saving benefits present to the believer.
- **Twofold grace** - the paired effects of union: (1) forensic justification; (2) participatory sanctification/transformation.
- **Forensic justification (imputation)** - God's declarative reckoning of righteousness through Christ's obedience.
- **Participatory sanctification (impartation/participation)** - real share in Christ's life by the Spirit, producing moral and spiritual renewal.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's life of obedience and sacrificial suffering as the merit applied to believers.
- **Spirit as bond (nexus Spiritus)** - the Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ and effects the internal reality of salvation.
- **Word and sacraments (means of grace)** - instruments through which union is established and nourished; not mere signs but effective means.
- **Covenant framework** - union understood covenantally: Christ as federal head and mediator; believers as members of covenant body.
- **Imputation vs. infusion tension** - Calvin's balance: legal imputation remains primary in declaration, but is inseparable from inward transformation through participation.
- **In Christ / Christ's merits** - repeated Pauline categories reframed by Calvin as experiential and declarative realities.
- **Effectual calling and perseverance** - union grounds the assurance of perseverance and ongoing sanctification.
- **Communion of saints** - social dimension of union; corporate as well as individual participation in Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: concise articulation of Calvin's union-centered soteriology for doctrinal summaries.
 - As a **polemic**: resource against reductionist imputation-only or infusion-only interpretations.
 - As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates how Calvin reads Pauline texts on "in Christ" and applies them doctrinally.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating sacramental, pneumatological, and forensic loci in Reformed systematic theology.
