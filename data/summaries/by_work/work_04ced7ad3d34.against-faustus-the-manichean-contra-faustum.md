### TITLE
Against Faustus the Manichean (Contra Faustum) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Composed c. early 5th century (after Augustine became bishop of Hippo, roughly 400-415). Augustine writes as a mature anti-Manichaean apologist within the Latin theological and ecclesial milieu, responding to Faustus of Mileve (a respected Manichaean bishop) and the broader Manichaean movement in North Africa.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A systematic refutation of Manichaean dualism, epistemology, and scriptural exegesis; defense of the coherence of Christian doctrine on God, creation, evil, providence, and revelation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Book-by-book refutation of Manichaean claims about the origin of evil and two principles (light/darkness).
 - Critique of Manichaean method of allegorical reading and selective use of Scripture; defense of orthodox typological and literal-sense reading bounded by rule of faith.
 - Demonstration that Christian teaching on creation, free will, and divine providence is philosophically and theologically superior to Manichaean explanations.
 - Appeal to internal coherence of Christian doctrines (Trinity, Christology, salvific economy) to overturn Manichaean contradictions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Faustus (primary interlocutor), Manichaean scriptures and teachers, classical philosophers (Platonic elements), Old and New Testament texts; Augustine regularly appeals to Roman ecclesial tradition and conciliar / patristic precedents.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and hermeneutics, the problem of evil (theodicy), creation doctrine, providence, human freedom, sin and redemption, Christology (implications for atonement and offices), ecclesial authority.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Augustine centers the work on the unity of God and the coherence of the Christian economy of salvation: revelation rightly read and interpreted resolves philosophical puzzles posed by Manichaeism and secures a providential, redemptive covenantal ordering of history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that error often arises from faulty scriptural interpretation rather than from Scripture itself; thus hermeneutics is a theological safeguard.
 - Integration of moral psychology and metaphysics in explaining sin and the privation theory of evil.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Manichaean dualism: denies ontological parity of good and evil; articulates evil as privation or disorder rather than a substantive principle.
 - Challenges Manichaean reliance on allegorizing Scripture to justify heterodox metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in arguing for a single, sovereign Creator whose providence orders history-language and approaches that later shaped medieval and Reformed covenantal thinking.
 - Methodological insistence on harmonizing literal, moral, and spiritual senses of Scripture under ecclesial rule.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Augustine became a foundational source for Western covenant theology; Contra Faustum contributes materials on interpretation, creation, and evil that Reformation and post-Reformation writers mined when constructing covenantal and federal frameworks.
 - Modern debates (e.g., Federal Vision monocovenantalism) invoke Augustinian unity of salvation-history differently - some appeal to his emphasis on continuity and corporate identity; others note his distinctions between law and grace that resist simplistic monocovenantal readings.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Exemplifies how theological argument can combine philosophical rigor, scriptural exegesis, and pastoral concern; prime text for exploring hermeneutics, theodicy, and the conceptual foundations of covenantal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Privation of evil:** Augustine's core answer to Manichaean dualism - evil is lack or corruption of good, not an independent principle.
- **Two principles (Manichaean claim):** The object of Augustine's rebuttal; he defends monotheism and single-creator ontology.
- **Hermeneutical rule of faith:** Augustine's claim that interpretation must be governed by the apostolic faith and ecclesial rule.
- **Providence:** God's ordering of creation and history - Augustine uses it to explain apparent injustices and to undergird covenantal continuity.
- **Creation ex nihilo:** Affirmed against Manichaean cosmology; grounds God's sovereignty and the ontological goodness of the world.
- **Typology and foreshadowing:** Augustine's method for relating Old and New Testaments; supports continuity but allows for Christological fulfillment.
- **Christ's offices (prophet, priest, king / Munus Triplex):**
 - While more elaborated elsewhere, Contra Faustum presupposes Christ's singular role in revealing, mediating, and ruling salvation - a resource for later munus triplex formulations.
- **Law and Grace distinction:** Augustine clarifies that law has covenantal function but is fulfilled in Christ; important for later Reformed covenant loci.
- **Corporate identity / covenant people:** Augustine's ecclesiology emphasizes communal belonging and continuity across Testaments; used in covenant theology debates.
- **Scriptural authority vs. private revelation:** Augustine argues for canonical primacy and critiques extra-canonical revelations claimed by Manichaeans.
- **Theodicy:** Augustine's approach combining metaphysics and moral psychology to address evil within a covenantal framework.
- **Typological continuity:** Used to argue for a redemptive-historical reading that both distinguishes and unites Testaments.
- **Rule of faith:** Canonical and creedal boundaries for legitimate exegesis; source for confessional formulations.
- **Use across loci (how Contra Faustum is applied):**
 - As a **definition source** for privation theory of evil and arguments for creation ex nihilo.
 - As a **polemic model** against dualistic or heterodox readings of Scripture (useful in debates over Monocovenantalism).
 - As an **exegetical model** for disciplined typology and the hermeneutical principle that doctrine constrains interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in tracing how Augustine's integration of providence, ecclesial rule, and covenantal continuity shapes later Reformed and confessional formulations.
