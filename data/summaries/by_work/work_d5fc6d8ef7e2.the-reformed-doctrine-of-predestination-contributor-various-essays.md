### TITLE
The Reformed Doctrine of Predestination - essays by Anthony Hoekema (contributor)
Topics referenced: **Regeneration** and **Effectual Calling** (contributor essays within a 20th‑century Reformed-polemical volume)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 20th‑century Reformed theological revival and intramural clarification amid debates with Arminianism, hyper‑Calvinism, and newer evangelical revisionisms. Hoekema writes from a Christian Reformed / neo‑Reformed milieu, attentive to confessional sources (Canons of Dort, Westminster Standards) and pastoral concerns.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Predestination must be understood so that **God's sovereign, unconditional election is the ground of effectual calling and regeneration**, while preserving human responsibility and the instrumental role of the Word. The doctrine is both doctrinal and pastoral: it secures assurance and praise without dissolving moral accountability.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Define predestination and election biblically and confessionally; situate doctrine within covenantal soteriology. 
 - Distinguish between the *general call* of the gospel (external offer) and the *effectual call* (internal, Spirit‑wrought summons that results in faith). 
 - Argue for **monergistic regeneration**: regeneration is the Spirit's sovereign work that precedes and enables faith; faith is a fruit, not the meritorious cause. 
 - Clarify logical vs. chronological ordering: election logically grounds calling and regeneration but God's decree and human experience are not reducible to temporal sequence. 
 - Address pastoral consequences: assurance, evangelism, and pastoral care in light of effectual calling.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutors: John Calvin, Augustine, John Owen; Reformed confessions (Dordt, Westminster). 
 - Contemporary critics: Arminian theologians, hyper‑Calvinists, and those promoting an evangelical "decisionist" soteriology. 
 - Scripture proof‑texts: Romans (esp. 8-11), Ephesians (1, 2), John (6), Titus.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Predestination, election, reprobation, covenant of grace, regeneration (new birth), effectual calling, grace (monergism vs. synergism), justification (forensic), perseverance, assurance.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 The doctrine of predestination, rightly taught, is **the doctrine of God's sovereign, transforming grace** - it secures salvation in Christ by the Spirit's effectual call while sustaining evangelistic fervor and pastoral assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong pastoral framing: theological precision coupled with applications for assurance and evangelism. 
 - Emphasis on the distinction and relation between the external gospel call and the Spirit's internal, effective call.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Rejects hyper‑Calvinist passivity (neglect of evangelism) and softens deterministic caricatures by insisting on real human responsibility. 
 - Counters Arminian and decisionist accounts that make human response the ground or engine of salvation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Careful operational distinction between **regeneration** (the ontological new birth) and **effectual calling** (the relational summons that issues in conversion), while insisting they are inseparable in the order of salvation (ordo salutis).

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries for clear, pastoral articulations of election and calling; frequently cited in discussions of monergism and the nature of the call. 
 - Influential among moderate conservative Reformed readers who seek a pastoral Calvinism - less persuasive to strict hyper‑Calvinists or those committed to Arminian paradigms.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - A useful bridge between confessional theology and pastoral practice; models how to defend classical Calvinism without doctrinal dogmatism or pastoral harshness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Predestination:** Divine eternal decree by which God determines the salvation of some (election) and passes over others (reprobation). Grounds effectual calling. 
- **Election:** God's gracious choice of individuals/groups to salvation, unconditional in ground (not based on foreseen faith). 
- **Effectual calling:** The Spirit's internal, efficacious summons that brings the elect to faith and repentance; differs from the general external call. 
 - Relation: the effectual call is the means by which election is realized in experience. 
- **Regeneration (new birth):** A sovereign, irreversible renewal of the sinner's nature by the Holy Spirit that precedes saving faith. 
- **General call vs. Special call:** External proclamation vs. internal God‑wrought calling that results in conversion. 
- **Monergism:** Doctrine that regeneration is the work of God alone (no human cooperation in the new birth). 
- **Synergism:** Rejected as inadequate to explain effectual calling in Hoekema's account. 
- **Unconditional election:** The view that election rests on God's free grace, not foreseen merits or responses. 
- **Limited atonement (particular redemption):** Often presupposed in the volume's Reformed framework as consistent with effectual calling. 
- **Ordo salutis:** Logical ordering of salvation events; used to explain relation among decree, calling, regeneration, and faith. 
- **Assurance:** Pastoral fruit of doctrine when election and effectual calling are properly applied. 
- **Covenant of grace:** The theological matrix in which predestination and calling are located; emphasizes God's promises.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definitional and confessional source** for predestination, effectual calling, and regeneration in Reformed curricula. 
- As a **polemic resource** against Arminianism and hyper‑Calvinism - clarifying boundaries while insisting on pastoral responsibility. 
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans, Ephesians, and John in support of monergistic regeneration and the distinction between external and effectual call.
