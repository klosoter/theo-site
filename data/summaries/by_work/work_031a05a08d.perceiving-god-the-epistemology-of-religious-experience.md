### TITLE
Perceiving God: The Epistemology of Religious Experience - William P. Alston

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in late 20th century analytic theology/epistemology milieu (1991 collection and earlier essays). Responds to mid-century positivism, Humean skepticism, and the rising movement of Reformed epistemology.
 - Bridges analytic philosophy of religion and epistemology of perception; converses with William James, A. J. Ayer, Hume, R. M. Hare, Alvin Plantinga, and Richard Swinburne.

- **Central thesis**
 - Religious experiences can be epistemically analogous to sensory perception; they can provide **non-inferential, prima facie warrant** for beliefs about God (or the divine) unless appropriate defeaters are present.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Sketches a *perceptual model* of religious experience:
 - Religious experience has a phenomenology that can present God as an object (or ground) in a way structurally similar to sense perception presenting everyday objects.
 - If the experience is properly formed and functions reliably, it confers prima facie justification for the corresponding theistic beliefs.
 - Distinguishes *warrant* from indefeasible certainty:
 - Warrant is defeasible; rebutting or undermining defeaters can remove the justificatory force.
 - Critiques purely inferential or evidentialist accounts:
 - Argues that requiring propositional evidence for every religious belief misconstrues how beliefs are formed and justified in ordinary epistemic practices.
 - Clarifies limits and differences:
 - Acknowledges disanalogies (non-empirical object, potential for cultural shaping), and handles them by modifying perceptual analogy rather than abandoning it.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Humean and positivist skepticism (Ayer), William James's pragmatism/varieties of religious experience, Plantinga's proper function and Reformed epistemology, Swinburne's probabilistic theism, and opponents in evidentialist tradition.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (experience as a mode of revelation), knowledge of God, epistemic justification of religious belief, testimonial and communal dimensions of religious knowledge.
 - Implications for apologetics and practical theology (pastoral evaluation of experiential claims).

- **Closing line**
 - Religious experience, properly understood as perceptual-like and prima facie epistemically authoritative, can legitimately ground belief in God absent adequate defeaters.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats religious experience not merely as psychological or evidentiary datum but as a *perceptual epistemic source* akin to sight or hearing.
 - Emphasizes **prima facie warrant**: experience gives an initial epistemic entitlement which must be defeated by counter-evidence, not one that must always be bolstered by external proof.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against strict evidentialists (Clifford-style), Alston denies that all religious belief must be inferentially grounded in public evidence.
 - Compared to Plantinga, Alston is more focused on the *phenomenology and justificatory role* of experience (while Plantinga foregrounds proper function and warrant in a broader theory).
 - Moves beyond James's pragmatism by offering a systematic epistemic account rather than primarily psychological or pragmatic vindication.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Develops the label of *religious perception* and refines the notion of *reliable belief-forming practices* for religious epistemology.
 - Clarifies the role of *defeaters* in experiential justification within a perceptual schema.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in analytic philosophy of religion and epistemology; frequently cited by proponents of Reformed epistemology and defenders of experiential sources of revelation.
 - Criticized by evidentialists and naturalists who stress error-proneness, cognitive science objections, or social/constructionist accounts of religious phenomena.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, philosophically rigorous framework for taking religious experience seriously as an epistemic source.
 - Useful for theological method, apologetics, and pastoral reflection on the status of experiential claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious experience**
 - Direct experiential states or events that present the divine or ultimacy to a subject; phenomenally significant for belief-formation.
- **Religious perception**
 - Alston's analogy: experience that presents God in a perception-like way; central thesis that such perception can confer warrant.
- **Prima facie warrant**
 - Initial justification conferred by experience that holds unless defeaters are introduced.
- **Defeaters**
 - Evidence or reasons that undermine or rebut the prima facie justificatory force of an experiential belief.
- **Non-inferential justification**
 - Justification that does not rest on prior propositions or arguments but arises directly from the experience itself.
- **Perceptual model**
 - Structural analogy between sensory perception and religious experience used to ground epistemic claims.
- **Warrant**
 - Epistemic standing or justification; Alston's account treats it as defeasible and practice-dependent.
- **Phenomenology**
 - The experiential character or "what it is like" dimension that gives experiences their justificatory force.
- **Reliabilism / proper function (contextual)**
 - Elements of externalist thinking: reliability of the experience-producing faculty and functioning in an appropriate environment matter for warrant.
- **Evidentialism (critique)**
 - The view that justification requires propositional evidence; Alston objects that it misreads ordinary epistemic practice.
- **Testimony and communal practices**
 - Alston acknowledges the role of religious communities and testimonial transmission in assessing and corroborating experiences.
- **Veridicality**
 - The notion of whether an experience accurately represents an external reality (here, God); primary epistemic aim.
- **Internal vs external considerations**
 - Alston's model sits between: emphasizes phenomenology (internal) but allows externalist reliability and defeaters.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "religious perception" and prima facie experiential warrant in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** against evidentialist accounts of religious knowledge in apologetics.
- As an **exegetical/modeling resource** for doctrines of revelation and experiential knowledge in pastoral theology and epistemology of faith.
