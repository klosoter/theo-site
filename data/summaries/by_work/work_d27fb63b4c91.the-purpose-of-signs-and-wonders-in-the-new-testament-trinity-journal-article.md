### TITLE
The Purpose of Signs and Wonders in the New Testament - D. A. Carson (Trinity Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century response to the Charismatic Renewal and rising Continuationist claims; situated in evangelical, Reformed-friendly academic discourse. Carson writes as an exegetically careful critic of uncritical charismatic practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Carson contends that NT "signs and wonders" primarily functioned to authenticate the messianic ministry and the apostolic proclamation of the gospel, not as an open warrant for uncontrolled, normative charismatic practice in every church age.**
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of how the NT uses "signs" in the Gospels (especially John) to point to Christ's identity and kingdom inauguration.
 - Analysis of Acts: apostles' signs as confirmation of the gospel and of apostolic authority during the foundational period.
 - Treatment of Pauline material (esp. 1 Corinthians): gifts serve edification, order, and apostolic-intent; extraordinary gifts relate to the foundational, revelatory epoch.
 - Canonical-theological move: once the apostolic foundation and revelation are given, the primary justificatory/confirmatory role of signs is curtailed; normative life governed by Scripture and ecclesial order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy reliance on NT texts; interacts with modern interpreters on both sides - Charismatic proponents (e.g., contemporary continuationist scholars) and classical cessationists (drawing lines from Warfield-type concerns).
 - Dialogue with Pauline scholarship (e.g., readings of 1 Corinthians) and with Johannine "sign" theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (public apostolic revelation vs. ongoing revelatory claims)
 - **Pneumatology** (role of Spirit in confirming message vs. bestowing gifts)
 - **Christology** (signs point to Christ's identity and kingdom)
 - **Ecclesiology and Apostolicity** (foundation, authority, and order)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Signs and wonders in the NT are primarily **confirmatory, covenantal‑foundational acts** tied to the apostolic epoch and the inauguration of Christ's messianic reign, not license for unchecked, perpetually normative revelatory practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes **purpose over phenomenology**: classify miracles by their function (authentication, proclamation, pastoral aid) rather than merely by type or frequency.
 - Stresses the canonical context: signs must be read within the story of covenantal transition (promise -> fulfillment -> apostolic foundation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Offers a measured corrective to both uncritical charismatic assertions of normative continuity and to extreme cessationist dismissals that ignore ongoing Spirit activity.
 - More conservative than some charismatic scholars, but avoids speculative historical arguments about an immediate cessation date; focuses on NT intentionality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses a functional taxonomy (authentication vs edification vs attestation) to clarify otherwise polemical language around "gifts."
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed/evangelical debates as a balanced, exegetically rigorous statement favoring limited continuity of Spirit gifts.
 - Received respect from both critics and some moderates among charismatics for methodological clarity even when disagreeing with conclusions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model of exegetical restraint and as a concise theological framework for thinking about the **purpose** of wonders, making it useful in seminary teaching and in pastoral corrective contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Signs and wonders**
 - NT phenomenon broadly denoting miracles; Carson insists on discerning **purpose** (what they point to) not merely their existence.
- **Authentication**
 - Primary function in many NT contexts: to validate messianic/apostolic claims.
- **Confirmation**
 - Acts of the Spirit that confirm the gospel message during the foundational apostolic era.
- **Foundational/apostolic epoch**
 - The period in which signs played a distinct attesting role tied to revelation and church foundation.
- **Edification**
 - Secondary function of some gifts (esp. prophecy, tongues when interpreted) for building the church.
- **Canonical closure / normativity**
 - With apostolic revelation recorded, Scripture becomes the authoritative norm; signs lose their justificatory role.
- **Revelatory gifts**
 - Gifts that purportedly communicate new divine revelation; Carson is wary of claims that bypass apostolic Scripture.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Discussion of the Spirit's role in both extraordinary acts and ordinary sanctification.
- **Christological sign-acts**
 - Jesus' miracles as pointers to his identity and kingdom, especially in Johannine theology.
- **Continuationism**
 - The view that all charismatic gifts continue; Carson engages but critiques its claims about normative purpose.
- **Cessationism**
 - The view that some or all gifts ceased; Carson's work is often used to support a qualified cessationist stance.
- **Apostolic authority**
 - Key criterion for discerning when signs are normative: tied to apostolic office and foundational revelation.
- **Function over form**
 - Methodological motto: determine the role miracles play in Scripture rather than cataloging occurrences.
- **Edifying vs attestational dichotomy**
 - Useful heuristic: whether a sign serves building up believers (edifying) or proving a foundational truth (attestational).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: concise statement of NT purposes for signs used in textbooks and syllabi.
 - **Polemic**: a primary citation in theological debates defending restricted continuism/qualified cessationism.
 - **Exegetical model**: exemplar of reading texts by discerning authorial intent and canonical function rather than immediate experiential application.
