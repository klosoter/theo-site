### TITLE
Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (contributor)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical dispute amid the Charismatic Renewal and global Pentecostal growth; published in the Four Views anthology format that frames four contrasting evangelical responses for classroom and pastoral use. The milieu is primarily evangelical Protestant-Reformed and non-Reformed interlocutors engage charismatic practice, historic cessationism, and newer "third-wave" emphases.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Do New Testament "miraculous" or "sign" gifts (tongues, prophecy, healing, miracles) continue for the church today, and if so in what normative shape? The book sets four positions in dialogue to adjudicate biblical, theological, and pastoral claims.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Presentation of four distinct positions (classical cessationism; normative continuationism; cautious or "open but cautious" continuationism; and a mediating/third-way account).
 - Each position develops (1) exegesis of key texts (Acts, 1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12, Ephesians 4, Hebrews), (2) theological systematization (pneumatology, revelation), and (3) pastoral implications and criteria for authenticity.
 - Each author replies to others, producing a sustained back-and-forth on hermeneutics and ecclesial practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Representative contemporary evangelical scholars and pastors across the spectrum are engaged indirectly (the anthology format stages systematic rebuttal and rejoinder). Primary biblical exegesis is supplemented by historical surveys of patristic and Reformation-era attitudes toward gifts, and by contemporary Pentecostal literature.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (esp. Baptism of the Holy Spirit), revelation and Scripture (normativity and sufficiency), ecclesiology (office, order, and edification), soteriology in relation to Spirit baptism and gifts; secondary engagements with eschatology (signs as eschatological indicators).
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is a contested pneumatology: whether the Spirit's extraordinary manifestations remain normative for building and authenticating the church, or whether redemptive-historical closure of sign gifts makes them non-normative today.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - The anthology methodically juxtaposes contrary hermeneutical starting points (textual-historical vs. experiential-historical) within one volume, forcing direct comparisons on interpretive presuppositions.
 - Careful attention to pastoral tests for authenticity (fruit, corporate order, doctrinal conformity) beyond mere experiential reports.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Challenges caricatures on both sides: cessationists refine claims to avoid reductionist dismissal of Pentecostal experience; continuationists refine claims to avoid uncritical acceptance of all charismatic phenomena.
 - Pushes Reformed interlocutors to clarify what "sufficiency of Scripture" means for authority over purported new revelations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Precise parsing of "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" usages (inaugurating vs. subsequent empowerment models) and of "extraordinary" versus "ordinary" gifts as hermeneutical tools rather than mere descriptive tags.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely used in seminary courses as a primary classroom text for the debate; has shaped both Reformed caution and pastoral engagement with Pentecostalism by promoting mutual critique and clearer exegetical standards.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models civil doctrinal disputation, provides compact exegetical resources for each major position, and remains a go-to pedagogical resource when introducing the continuationism/cessationism debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism:** The view that sign/miraculous gifts continue until Christ's return; often argues for normative presence and occasional extraordinary operation in worship and mission.
- **Cessationism:** The view that sign gifts ceased with the apostolic era or the closing of the canon; emphasizes sufficiency of Scripture and normative ordinary means of grace.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit:** 
 - Two main uses explained: (1) Pauline/union with Christ at conversion; (2) subsequent empowering experience for ministry (distinctive in Pentecostal/charismatic accounts).
- **Glossolalia (tongues):** Distinguished as private prayer-language, congregational prophecy-tongues, and alleged ecstatic glossolalia; debated as sign vs. private edification.
- **Prophecy (ecclesial):** Distinguished between canonical revelation (closed) and noncanonical prophetic speech intended for edification, reproof, and comfort-criteria for testability stressed.
- **Sign gifts:** Miraculous occurrences (healings, miracles, tongues) functioning as authentication signs in Scripture; debate whether their sign role was time‑bound or ongoing.
- **Extraordinary vs Ordinary gifts:** Analytical distinction to separate charismatic manifestations (extraordinary) from universal gifts (teaching, service) that characterize church life.
- **Normative revelation vs canonical sufficiency:** Tension over whether experiential or new revelatory claims can carry normative authority alongside Scripture.
- **Evidential vs experiential criteria:** Differentiates apologetic/evidential claims for gifts (signs as authentication of the gospel) from private spiritual verification (subjective experience).
- **Third-wave/Neo-charismatic:** Contemporary movements claiming charismatic empowerment without classical Pentecostal ecclesiology; discussed as pastoral and theological phenomenon.
- **Hermeneutical starting point:** The methodological presupposition (textual, historical, or experiential) that shapes one's reading of gifts passages.
- **Pastoral tests for authenticity:** Criteria proposed across views: biblical conformity, ecclesial order, spiritual fruit, and accountability.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: to map and define the main positions in the continuationism/cessationism debate.
 - As a **polemic**: sources are mined by advocates on both sides for concise rebuttals and rejoinders.
 - As an **exegetical model**: provides sample exegesis of key passages (1 Cor 12-14, Acts) and sets methodological exemplars for seminary instruction.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and pneumatology courses for discussing authority, prophetic speech, and pastoral testing.
