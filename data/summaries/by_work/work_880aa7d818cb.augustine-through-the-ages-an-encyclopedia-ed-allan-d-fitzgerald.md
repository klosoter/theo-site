### TITLE
Augustine Through the Ages: An Encyclopedia (ed. Allan D. Fitzgerald) - concise reception-history reference on Augustine's theology and its impact across loci, with entries addressing Romans 11 and Israel, millennialism, Christ/culture questions, and church/state relations.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Modern, multi-author reference (late 20th/early 21st c. scholarship). Projects Augustine reception across eras: patristic, medieval, Reformation, modern, and contemporary theological debates.
 - Interdisciplinary: historical theology, biblical reception, ecclesiology, political theology, and eschatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - No single authorial thesis; purposeful encyclopedic aim: map Augustine's positions and their afterlife. Central problem addressed is how Augustine's texts have been interpreted, adapted, or contested on key theological and political issues (e.g., Israel's status, millennium, culture, church/state).
- **Core argument or structure**
 - The work aggregates thematic entries and biographical, doctrinal, and reception-oriented articles.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish original Augustinian texts and arguments (Confessions, City of God, On Christian Doctrine, letters, sermons).
 - Trace historical reception (ancient interpreters, medieval glosses, reformers, modern theologians).
 - Assess influence on particular loci (eschatology, ecclesiology, political theology, biblical interpretation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Augustine (Confessions, City of God, De Civitate Dei, On the Trinity, anti-Pelagian writings), his opponents (Pelagius, Donatists, Manichaeans), and biblical texts (esp. Romans).
 - Secondary/interlocutors: Ambrose, Jerome, medieval scholastics, Luther, Calvin, later Catholic and Protestant interpreters, modern scholars.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennial debate, Romans 11 and Israel), ecclesiology (mixed church, sacraments), soteriology (original sin, grace, predestination), political theology (two cities, just war, coercion), Christology and revelation.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Augustine emerges as the pivotal interpreter whose synthesis of sin and grace, two cities anthropology, and historical eschatology reshaped Western theology and continues to be the primary lens through which later traditions negotiate Romans 11, millennial expectation, cultural engagement, and church-state boundaries.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Focus on Augustine as a reception-shaping authority rather than merely an original author; emphasis on how his categories (two cities, original sin, inner conversion) function across debates.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Highlights Augustine's systematic rebuttals to Pelagian optimism, Manichaean dualism, and Donatist rigorism; shows how later readers sometimes misread Augustine to support positions he opposed (e.g., easy predestinarian caricatures, militant church-state fusion).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Traces Augustine's coinage and consolidation of terms/concepts: two cities, original sin as hereditary corruption, amillennial hermeneutic for Revelation, doctrine of mixed body (corpus mixtum), nuanced use of Romans 11 on Israel's covenantal future.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Shows Augustine as foundational for Reformers (Luther, Calvin) on grace/predestination; also central in Catholic counter-reform and modern ecumenical appropriation. Demonstrates contested appropriation in political theology (use/misuse regarding state coercion).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides compact, authoritative summaries of primary texts and reception lines; indispensable for courses on reception history, doctrinal development, and the theological roots of contemporary debates about Israel, millennial expectations, culture, and polity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Two Cities (Civitas Dei / Civitas Terrena)** - Augustine's principal political/theological framework for ordering earthly and heavenly loyalties.
- **Original Sin (peccatum originale)** - hereditary corruption; central to Augustine's soteriology and to later debates on infant salvation and grace.
- **Grace (gratia)** - prevenient and efficacious; the encyclopedia shows how this term shaped Reformation readings.
- **Predestination (praedestinatio)** - Augustinian development against Pelagianism; traced to Reformation appropriations and later controversies.
- **City of God (De Civitate Dei)** - the book as locus classicus for Augustine's eschatology, political theology, and critique of pagan temporal hopes.
- **Confessions (Confessiones)** - Augustine's anthropology of interior conversion; used to discuss pastoral theology and spiritual formation.
- **Romans 11 / Israel's Future** - entries summarize Augustine's reading: Israel's role transformed in Christ; historical fulfillment perspective rather than restorationist future.
 - Relation to Gentile inclusion (olive tree metaphor) and covenant continuity debates.
- **Millennial Views / Amillennialism** - Augustine's rejection of literal millennium in City of God bk.20; pivotal moment for the dominance of amillennial interpretation in Latin Christianity.
- **Christ and Culture / Eschatological Perspective** - Augustine's two-cities lens produces a posture of cultural engagement tempered by eschatological realism (engage but not idolize culture).
- **Church and State Relations (two swords, coercion)** - entries treat Augustine's qualified endorsement of state power to maintain order and assist the church, and his nuanced restraint compared to later absolutist readings.
- **Donatist Controversy** - formative context for Augustine's ecclesiology (mixed body, church purity vs. catholicity).
- **Just War** - Augustine as formative in Christian casuistry on legitimate use of force and the duties of rulers.
- **Mixed Body (corpus mixtum)** - the church is composed of saints and sinners; informs sacramental and disciplinary theology.
- Usage across loci:
 - Used as a **definition source** for Augustinian terminology and systematic placement.
 - Used as an **exegetical model and reception-history guide** for Romans 11, eschatology (millennium), Christ/culture thought, and political theology (church/state).
