### TITLE
Reason and Belief in God (essay in Faith and Rationality, 1983) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Delivered within the early-1980s analytic revival of philosophy of religion; published in the influential conference volume Faith and Rationality (eds. Plantinga & Wolterstorff, 1983).
 - Responds to dominant twentieth-century **evidentialist** attitudes in Anglo-American epistemology and to classical foundationalist standards for rational belief.

- **Central thesis**
 - Belief in God can be **properly basic** and rational without being inferentially grounded on argument or evidential proof; the standard evidentialist requirement that all religious belief must be supported by argument is unjustified.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of evidentialism: the demand for evidence for every belief is self-defeating and inconsistent with ordinary epistemic practice (e.g., belief in other minds, the external world).
 - Analogy move: many widely accepted beliefs (memory, perception, belief in other minds) are non-inferentially justified; God-belief should be treated analogously if produced by reliable faculties.
 - Appeal to a sensus divinitatis and the possibility that cognitive faculties are properly functioning to produce theistic belief in appropriate circumstances.
 - Conclusion: Christian/theistic belief may be rationally held as **basic**; objections must show defeaters or show the faculty is unreliable.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Targets: evidentialists (exemplified by W.K. Clifford), classical foundationalists, and skeptics demanding proof for religious belief.
 - Draws on historical resources: Thomas Reid and common-sense epistemology; Calvinian idea of sensus divinitatis as a theological parallel.
 - Converses with contemporaries in analytic philosophy of religion (e.g., R. M. Hare, Richard Swinburne indirectly) and sets stage for later debates with critics like Michael Martin and William Rowe.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Epistemology of revelation and religious knowledge (not detailed exegetical theology).
 - Implicit engagement with **revelation** (sensus divinitatis), the nature of religious experience, and the rationality of Christian belief as a cognitive attitude.
 - Not primarily about Trinity or Christology, but about the epistemic status of belief in God (broadly theism/Christian theism).

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Theism (and Christian belief) can be a rational, non-inferentially grounded, properly basic cognitive stance when formed by functioning faculties in appropriate conditions; the burden lies on evidentialists to justify their stricter standard.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong reclamation of **proper basicality** for religious belief as the default epistemic posture unless specific defeaters appear.
 - Moves the debate from apologetic proof to **epistemic normality** and cognitive competence.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects Cliffordian evidentialism that moralizes belief-as-response-to-proof.
 - Revises classical foundationalism by broadening what counts as non-inferentially justified belief (following Reid, but with analytic precision).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized modern deployment of **"properly basic"** within Reformed epistemology; later linked to Plantinga's notion of **warrant** (developed more fully in later works).
 - Re-articulated the **sensus divinitatis** in analytic epistemic terms rather than primarily theological-historical exposition.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed the contemporary movement called **Reformed epistemology**; dramatic influence in philosophy of religion and Christian apologetics.
 - Sparked widespread debate: defenders developed externalist accounts of warrant; critics raised the "Great Pumpkin" and defeater/epistemic parity objections.
 - Significant cross-pollination into systematic theology, pastoral apologetics, and analytic theology curricula.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable corrective to evidentialist overreach and reframes apologetics as epistemic ecology (faculty reliability, defeaters).
 - Remains a central starting point for courses and research on religious epistemology and Christian intellectual humility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Properly basic belief**
 - A non-inferential belief that is rational to hold without evidence from other beliefs (e.g., perception, memory); Plantinga argues God-belief can be such.
- **Evidentialism**
 - The view that rational belief requires evidence; Plantinga challenges its universal application.
- **Sensus divinitatis**
 - Calvinian idea of a God-given cognitive capacity to form belief in God; used to model how theistic belief might be properly basic.
- **Reformed epistemology**
 - The broader school that treats religious belief as potentially warranted without inferential proof; Plantinga a principal founder.
- **Classical foundationalism**
 - Epistemic theory requiring strict basic beliefs (clear, indubitable); Plantinga disputes its narrowness.
- **Warrant**
 - (Emerging in this period) the property that turns true belief into knowledge; fully developed by Plantinga later, but anticipated here via reliability and proper function.
- **Non-inferential belief**
 - Beliefs formed directly by cognitive faculties rather than via inference; central to Plantinga's analogies.
- **Defeaters**
 - Arguments or evidence that undermine a belief's rationality; Plantinga concedes these can render basic beliefs irrational.
- **Proper function**
 - The idea that cognitive faculties must operate correctly in suitable epistemic environments for beliefs to be justified (precursor to later warranty doctrine).
- **Analogy to commonsense epistemology**
 - Use of ordinary epistemic practice (belief in other minds, the past) to normalize non-inferential theistic belief.
- **Great Pumpkin objection**
 - A common critic's parody: if belief in the Great Pumpkin can be properly basic, why not God? Plantinga responds by appeal to defeaters and differing epistemic credentials.
- **Externalism vs internalism**
 - Plantinga's move favors externalist considerations (faculty reliability) over strictly internalist justificatory requirements.
- **Epistemic parity**
 - The idea that religious and non-religious beliefs can stand on equal epistemic footing absent defeaters.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed epistemology and "properly basic" as a legitimate epistemic category.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist apologetics and the demand that religious belief prove itself inferentially.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and debates about religious epistemology, moving focus from proofs to cognitive faculties, warrant, and defeaters.
