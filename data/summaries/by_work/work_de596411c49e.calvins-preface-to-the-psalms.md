### TITLE
John Calvin - Preface to the Psalms (Prefatory material to his commentary; Geneva, mid-16th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation Geneva; part of Calvin's commentaries on Scripture and closely linked with the Genevan Psalter project.
 - Theological milieu: Protestant emphasis on sola Scriptura, renewed interest in Hebrew, rejection of medieval allegorizing excess, pastoral formation of corporate worship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalter is a divinely given treasury that both reveals Christ and trains the soul in prayer; it must be read with sober grammatical-historical method yet with a typological expectation of Christ as the goal and fulfillment.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defense of the Psalms as prophetic and pastoral: they are inspired, applicable, and oriented toward Christ.
 - Methodological claims:
 - Start from the literal/grammatical sense; avoid fanciful allegory.
 - Recognize typology: Old Testament realities and words are shadows whose true meaning is seen in Christ (fulfillment).
 - Apply the Psalms pastorally - for consolation, confession, petition, praise, and instruction in sanctification.
 - Practical aims:
 - Provide pastors and laity with interpretive guidance for preaching and devotion.
 - Encourage the use of the Psalms in private and public prayer/singing.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Church Fathers (e.g., Augustine) selectively; critiques medieval allegorists and certain scholastic tendencies.
 - Implied contrast with Roman Catholic exegesis that over-relies on allegory and sacramental readings; also positions against purely literalist Jewish readings that miss Christological fulfillment.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Scripture (inspiration, interpretation), Christology (Messianic fulfillment), typology and fulfillment, covenant, prayer/worship, providence, sanctification.
- **Closing line**
 - The Psalms function as Christ-centered Scripture for doctrine and devotion: they instruct the mind, govern prayer, and point typologically to the fulfillment in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that the Psalms are simultaneously prophetic (pointing to Christ), didactic (teaching doctrine), and pastoral (shaping prayer and piety).
 - Balances grammatical-historical exegesis with typological reading: Christ is the telos rather than an add-on allegory.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects the excesses of medieval allegorical interpretation while also correcting reductive literalism that divorces the Psalms from their Christological and covenantal horizon.
 - Pushes back against sacramentalizing readings that subsume the Psalms under ecclesial rites without theological interpretation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic integration of typology with the "uses" of Scripture - Calvin foregrounds how Psalms function in spiritual life (consolation, instruction, reproof, prayer).
 - Practical hermeneutic: Scripture interpreted for piety and preaching, not mere intellectual inquiry.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep impact on Reformed exegesis and worship: shaped Reformed psalmody, preaching, and a Christocentric hermeneutic.
 - Widely used by subsequent Reformed theologians as a model for reading Old Testament poetry Christologically but responsibly.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model for combining pastoral sensitivity, doctrinal clarity, and typological reading; invaluable for pastors, liturgists, and biblical theologians seeking a Reformed approach to the Psalter.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology** - Old Testament persons/offices/events are types whose true meaning is revealed in Christ; Calvin insists on measured typological fulfillment.
- **Fulfillment** - The Psalms' ultimate sense is realized in Christ (prophetic consummation rather than arbitrary allegory).
- **Literal / grammatical sense** - The initial anchor for interpretation; scripture's plain sense must guide typological moves.
- **Allegory (critique of)** - Dismissed when arbitrary; Calvin warns against fanciful spiritualizations divorced from text.
- **Messianic prophecy** - Psalms are often prophetic utterances concerning Christ's person and work.
- **Uses of Scripture (usus)** - Practical categories: doctrine, reproof, correction, instruction in righteousness; Calvin applies these to Psalms as tools for sanctification.
- **Prayer and praise** - Psalms model true prayer; they instruct both individual and corporate devotion.
- **Imprecatory Psalms** - Interpreted in light of God's justice and Christ's patience; Calvin avoids literal vindictiveness and sees them within covenantal trust.
- **Covenant** - Psalms reflect covenantal language; promises and complaints are read within God's covenanted dealings culminating in Christ.
- **Christ as mediator / telos** - Central interpretive key: Christ mediates and fulfills the meanings and promises of the Psalms.
- **Pastoral hermeneutic** - Interpretation aimed at edification and spiritual formation, not mere antiquarian or scholastic ends.
- **Liturgical psalmody** - Calvin links interpretation to the practice of singing and praying the Psalms in worship.
- **Scriptural authority** - Psalms regarded as inspired Scripture binding for faith and life.
- **Sanctification** - Psalms as instruments for shaping piety, patience, confession, and hope.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a model of Reformed exegetical method combining literal sense and typology (exegetical model).
 - As a pastoral and liturgical resource for psalmody and prayer in Reformed worship (liturgy/formation).
 - As a polemical corrective to allegorical and sacramental distortions, and as a defense of Christ-centered reading of the Old Testament (polemic/definitional pivot).
