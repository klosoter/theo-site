### TITLE
**Cornelis P. Venema, The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ (secondary study of the Three Forms of Unity)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Modern Reformed confessional revival (late 20th-early 21st c.); Venema writes as a Dutch-American Reformed theologian and professor responding to contemporary challenges to classic Reformed soteriology.
 - Pedagogical and polemical work aimed at pastors, seminarians, and confessional Presbyterians and Continental Reformed churches that hold the Three Forms of Unity as normative interpretation of Scripture.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel must be understood as the *free acceptance of sinners in Christ* grounded objectively in Christ's person and work and announced in the covenantal promise - not as acceptance conditioned or merited by human works or new definitions of faith.
 - Problem addressed: distortions that relativize forensic justification, replace objective imputation with covenantal participation defined by present faithfulness (e.g., Federal Vision tendencies).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of the Three Forms of Unity on key loci: justification, covenant, union with Christ, assurance.
 - Historical-theological tracing of the confessional language of "free acceptance" and its roots in Reformation and post-Reformation formularies.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Ground of acceptance = Christ's active and passive obedience and substitutionary satisfaction.
 - Instrument = faith (a receptive, trusting appropriation), distinct from works or covenantal persistence.
 - Result = forensic declaration of righteousness and relational union with Christ (objective and declared).
 - Polemic against views that fuse justification with covenantal obedience or that make justification contingent on present faithfulness (Federal Vision critique).
 - Pastoral applications on preaching, assurance, and sacramental theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Three Forms of Unity (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort).
 - Secondary interlocutors: classical Reformation figures (Calvin, Bucer, Beza) and later Reformed theologians; contemporary critics including proponents of the Federal Vision and related revisionist readings of covenant and justification.
 - Engagement with analytic categories like *historia salutis* vs *ordo salutis* to clarify how objective events in Christ ground the applied order of salvation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, justification (forensic), imputation, union with Christ, Christology (active/passive obedience), soteriological order (historia vs ordo), sacraments, assurance.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Venema insists the gospel is the objective, covenantal promise of **free acceptance in Christ** grounded in his vicarious obedience - a forensic reality that secures assurance and distinguishes the Reformed gospel from any system that ties justification to human performance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Champions the phrase **"free acceptance"** as the confessional shorthand that unites forensic imputation with covenantal promise; treats acceptance as both legal declaration and covenantal reception.
 - Stresses continuity between the objective accomplishment of Christ (historia salutis) and the order of personal appropriation (ordo salutis) without collapsing one into the other.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects revisionist tendencies (notably Federal Vision strains) that relativize imputation by making justification a byproduct of covenant faithfulness or sacramental participation.
 - Reasserts a clear forensic model against both antinomian and works-dependent distortions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes confessional language into pastoral-theological categories useful for contemporary debates: "free acceptance" becomes a bridging concept between doctrine and assurance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed circles for clarifying confessional commitments; used in debates over Federal Vision and justification controversies.
 - Serves as a concise resource for confessional denominations reinforcing classic imputation and covenantal promise.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact synthesis of confessional soteriology for teaching; durable resource for defending forensic justification and guiding pastoral proclamation emphasizing assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free acceptance** - The gospel promise that sinners are accepted in Christ apart from merit; central confessional trope Venema recovers.
- **Justification (forensic)** - God's declaring of sinners righteous on account of Christ's obedience; non-meritorious, declarative.
- **Imputation** - Christ's obedience and our sins legally accounted (credited/charged); ground of the free acceptance.
- **Union with Christ** - Existential and forensic bond that is the believer's status and means of participation in Christ's benefits.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's perfect life and atoning death as the content of the righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Covenant of grace** - The framework in which the promise of free acceptance is articulated and applied.
- **Assurance** - Pastoral corollary of free acceptance; rests on objective promise and not mere subjective experience.
- **Historia salutis vs Ordo salutis** - Venema uses the distinction to defend that objective historical events in Christ (historia) ground the sequence of appropriation (ordo) without reducing justification to a later moral process.
 - Clarifies that the accomplished work (historia) is the foundation for declared acceptance; the ordo orders application but cannot redefine the ground of acceptance.
- **Federal Vision (critique)** - Identified and critiqued as a threat that blurs declaration and covenantal participation, potentially redefining justification by present faithfulness.
- **Covenantal participation** - Properly understood as grounded in imputed righteousness; Venema resists readings that make participation constitutive of justification.
- **Sacramental application** - Sacraments as means of assurance and sign/ seal of the promise, not as automatic conferment of right standing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed reading of "gospel" and "justification."
 - As a **polemic** and clarifying resource in debates with Federal Vision and similar revisionist positions.
 - As an **exegetical-model** and pedagogical tool linking confessional texts (Three Forms of Unity) to contemporary preaching and pastoral theology.
