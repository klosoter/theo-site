### TITLE
The Person of Christ (secondary: Donald Macleod) - John Calvin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation theology; Geneva as a center of Reformed scholastic and pastoral work.
 - Calvin writes within Chalcedonian commitments reacting to medieval scholastic distortions and contemporary controversies (Arian echoes, later debates anticipating modern kenoticism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Affirm the full deity and full humanity of the one Christ without confusion, division, or subtraction of either nature; explain how the Son "emptied himself" (Phil. 2) without ceasing to be God.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis (Philippians, John, Hebrews, Isaiah) demonstrates both the divine pre-existence and genuine human experience of Jesus.
 - Logical-theological move: God cannot have his divine essence diminished; what occurs in the incarnation is a voluntary self-limitation (mode of operation), not an ontological loss.
 - The union is hypostatic: one person subsisting in two natures, permitting a genuine communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum) while guarding against Nestorian separation or Eutychian confusion.
 - Practical soteriology follows: the mediator must be truly God and truly man to effect redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Chalcedon, Augustine, patristic exegesis, and Reformers (Luther, later Reformed theologians).
 - Implicitly opposes Arian tendencies, Nestorian division, Eutychian fusion, and, by extension, later kenotic proposals that posit divine attrition.
 - Secondary interlocutor cited here: Donald Macleod - modern critic of kenoticism who reinforces Calvinian concerns about divine immutability and soteriological consequences.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Incarnation, Trinity, hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum, immutability of God, atonement/substitution, Christ's knowledge and voluntary self-limitation (Philippians 2).
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin locates the theological gravity of Christology in a Chalcedonian-Reformed center: the Word became flesh by voluntary condescension, not by forfeiture of divine being - ensuring a Savior who is fully God and fully man for effectual redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong stress that kenosis is accommodation/voluntary refraining, not ontological emptying; language of "veiling" divine attributes in the flesh.
 - Persistent coupling of metaphysical restraint (God's immutability) with pastoral exegesis of Philippians 2.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against medieval scholastic tendencies that overly abstract the union into speculative categories; vs. Nestorian split and Eutychian fusion - Calvin insists on a relational, personal union retaining real properties.
 - Against 19th-20th-century kenotic proposals: Calvinian model rejects any doctrine that posits loss of deity or diminution of divine attributes in the incarnation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reformed clarification of communicatio idiomatum emphasizing relational and operational communication rather than metaphysical blending.
 - Use of moral/volitional limitation language to explain Christ's human ignorance or suffering without compromising divine attributes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cornerstone for Reformed Christology and confessional standards; widely used as the corrective paradigm in polemics against kenoticism and modern liberal reductions of deity.
 - Continues to inform evangelical exegetical practice and systematic treatments of incarnation and atonement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, Scripture-rooted method for balancing orthodoxy and pastoral access to the incarnation; valuable model for teaching Christ's twofold nature and for critiquing theories that undercut divine immutability or the sufficiency of Christ's deity for atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union** - one person (the Son) subsisting in two distinct natures (divine and human) without confusion or division.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - real but disciplined transfer of properties between natures (e.g., we may say "God suffered" because the person who is God suffered in his human nature).
- **Kenosis** - Calvin reads Philippians 2 as self-emptying of prerogative and right, not divesting of divine essence; criticizes kenotic readings that posit ontological loss.
 - Relation: distinguished from 19th-century kenoticism which suggests divine attribute subtraction.
- **Immutability (immutabilitas Dei)** - God does not undergo essential change; central pole against ontological kenosis.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending communication of divine activity in ways suited to human nature; Calvin uses this to interpret apparent limitations in Christ.
- **Extra calvinisticum** (implicit) - the divine nature is not confined to the human nature; Calvin maintains divine transcendence alongside union.
- **Philippians 2 exegesis** - key text: "emptying" read as humbling and assuming limitations, not divesting deity.
- **Atonement/Substitution** - requires full deity and full humanity; Calvin links Christ's person directly to efficacy of redemption.
- **Soteriological consequence** - any doctrine diminishing deity undermines objective atonement and mediation.
- **Chalcedonian standard** - Calvin's Christology is anchored in the formula "one person, two natures" used as exegetical and doctrinal norm.
- **Voluntary self-limitation** - term to describe how divine actions are refrained from, not lost; central to Calvin's response to kenosis.
- **Scriptural method** - exegesis drives doctrine; philosophical categories used subordinate to biblical testimony.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed Christology and the distinction between kenosis-as-accommodation and kenosis-as-ontological loss.
- As a **polemic resource** against modern kenotic theories and doctrinal erosions that threaten divine immutability or the efficacy of atonement.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 and other incarnation texts within a Trinitarian-Chalcedonian framework.
