### TITLE
A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith - contributor: **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** 
Focus (here): **Human Nature - Psychosomatic Unity**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed theological renewal: biblical-theological, covenantal, and confessional retrieval within conservative Reformed seminaries.
 - Reaction both to popular evangelical Cartesian dualism and to secular reductionist materialism; seeks to situate anthropology within Christ-centered systematic theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Humans are fundamentally **psychosomatic unities**: neither simple immaterial souls detached from bodies nor reducible material organisms. This unity must be understood biblically, christologically, and eschatologically.
 - The doctrinal problem: how to hold postmortem personal continuity, the reality of death, and the hope of resurrection without collapsing into either Platonic immortality or purely materialist annihilation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical-linguistic exegesis: Hebrew "nephesh" and Greek "psuche/soma" usages demonstrate overlapping personal, bodily, and life-force senses; Scripture does not present a sharp ontological soul/body dualism.
 - Pauline anthropology: Paul's language of life, death, and resurrection presupposes embodied persons whose identity persists through divine action (not independent immortal souls).
 - Christology and union with Christ: the re-creation and renewal of human nature is realized in Christ's incarnation, death, resurrection, and the believer's union with him - shaping both present sanctification and future bodily resurrection.
 - Eschatology as hermeneutical key: the resurrection body, not the isolated immaterial soul, is the endpoint of human personhood; intermediate presence of the soul is recognized but subordinated to resurrection-centered hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (Genesis, Psalms, Gospels, Pauline corpus) foremost.
 - Reformed confessions and theologians (Calvin, Westminster tradition); Augustine selectively engaged on soul doctrine.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Cartesian dualists in evangelicalism, materialist philosophers, and some popular "immortality of the soul" proponents.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei, personhood), sin and its effect on bodily life, soteriology (union with Christ), Christology (incarnation and resurrection), eschatology (intermediate state and resurrection), sanctification (embodied life).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **human identity is embodied and redeemed through Christ - anthropology must be read through resurrection-shaped covenant theology rather than ancient dualisms or modern materialism.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers **resurrection** and **union with Christ** as determinative for anthropology: the goal of human existence is a renewed embodied person in Christ, not the escape of an immaterial soul.
 - Maintains a robust intermediate state language without granting it ontological primacy over the resurrection body.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical Platonic/Cartesian separability by showing Scripture's more integrated view of personhood.
 - Pushes back on reductionist materialist accounts that deny any substantive personal continuity beyond bodily processes.
 - Nuances traditional Reformed formulations: affirms subsistence of the person after death while refusing to make the immaterial soul the locus of ultimate human destiny.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Employs and clarifies the term **psychosomatic unity** as a theological-anthropological category rather than merely philosophical shorthand.
 - Frames "immortality" as derivative and eschatological (grounded in resurrection), not as intrinsic to an abstract soul.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed academic circles as a corrective to dualistic popular piety and to materialist reductionism.
 - Influential in seminary courses on anthropology, eschatology, and pastoral theology; critiques have come from both hardline dualists and radical physicalists.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically integrated model linking exegesis, Christology, and eschatology.
 - Useful pedagogically for reorienting students toward a resurrection-centered anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Human person as integrated body-soul unity; neither ontologically divided into independent substances nor reducible to mere biology.

- **Nephesh / Psuche**
 - Biblical terms indicating life/personhood often tied to bodily life; not a modern immaterial-substance term.

- **Soma / Body**
 - Embodied aspect that is essential to personhood and the locus of redemption in resurrection.

- **Intermediate state**
 - Personal subsistence after bodily death recognized but defined as provisional, awaiting resurrection.

- **Resurrection body**
 - Eschatological fulfillment of embodied personhood; continuity and transformation (not mere reanimation of old corpse).

- **Union with Christ**
 - Ontological and soteriological bond shaping present sanctification and future bodily destiny.

- **Imago Dei**
 - Humanity's God-likeness seen corporately and relationally; restored and fulfilled in the redeemed, embodied person in Christ.

- **Death (physical / spiritual)**
 - Physical death: separation of body and current embodied life; spiritual death: relational alienation from God remedied in Christ.

- **Eschatological personhood**
 - The doctrine that authentic human identity is completed in the resurrection and renewed embodied existence.

- **Conditional immortality? (usage note)**
 - Gaffin resists making immortality intrinsic to the soul; immortality is a gift realized in resurrection - not an endorsement of annihilationist reduction.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for **biblical and confessional anthropology** emphasizing integration of body and soul.
 - As a polemic tool against both **Platonic dualism** and **reductive materialism**, reclaiming a middle, biblically faithful stance.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline studies: reading Paul's anthropology through resurrection and union with Christ rather than philosophical presuppositions.
 - As a conceptual pivot in soteriology and eschatology courses: recasting salvation as the redemption of embodied human nature.
