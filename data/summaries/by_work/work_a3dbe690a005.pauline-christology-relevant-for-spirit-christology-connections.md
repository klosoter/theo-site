### TITLE
Pauline Christology (Gordon D. Fee) - emphasis on Spirit-Christology connections

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/charismatic scholarship; Fee speaks from rigorous historical-grammatical exegesis combined with pneumatological sympathy (see Fee's broader corpus, notably God's Empowering Presence and related essays on Paul).
 - Situated against post-war critical debates about Paul (e.g., N. T. Wright, Dunn, Sanders) and within rising interest in recovering Pauline pneumatology as central to theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Pauline Christology cannot be rightly understood apart from Pauline pneumatology: the Spirit is the locus and agent of Christ's present, saving reality for believers - union with the risen Christ is effected and experienced through the Spirit in redemptive history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of key Pauline texts (Romans, 1-2 Corinthians, Galatians, Philippians, Colossians) showing recurring formulae - union with Christ, "Spirit of Christ," resurrection by the Spirit.
 - The Spirit as hermeneutical key:
 - Spirit as agent of resurrection (1 Cor 15; Rom 8) and thus of Christ's present lordship.
 - Spirit as the one who unites believers to Christ (baptism into Christ by the Spirit; "in Christ" language).
 - Theological implications:
 - Soteriology reframed as participatory (participation in Christ) rather than merely forensic.
 - Ecclesiology and ethics follow from Spirit-mediated new life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Paul and early Christian creeds embedded in Pauline texts.
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary Pauline scholars (e.g., Dunn, Wright), and historic traditions that separate Christology and pneumatology.
 - Jewish apocalyptic and Hellenistic backgrounds used to illuminate Pauline categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Christ revealed by/through the Spirit), Trinity (interplay of Father, Son, Spirit), Christology (identity and present saving action of Christ), Pneumatology (role of Spirit in redemptive history), Soteriology (union with Christ, justification, sanctification), Ecclesiology, Eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Fee's theological center: **Paul's Christ is present and operative now because the Spirit makes the risen Lord real to and in his people - Christology and pneumatology are inseparable for understanding salvation in redemptive history.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes the **Spirit as the concrete agent** by whom believers participate in Christ (not a secondary or merely supportive role).
 - Treats Pauline union with Christ as ontic and experiential, mediated by the Spirit, not merely forensic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies in older Christologies that isolate the Son's work from the Spirit's ongoing presence - opposes Christomonism that sidelines pneumatology.
 - Offers critical engagement with scholars who underplay experiential/charismatic dimensions of Paul's thought.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tight coupling of phrases like **"Spirit-of-Christ"**, **"in Christ"**, and **baptism into the Spirit** as mutually interpretive clusters rather than disconnected motifs.
 - Treats resurrection and present sanctifying/empowering work through the same pneumatic logic.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received among evangelicals and Pentecostal scholars for integrating rigorous exegesis with robust pneumatology.
 - Respected by Reformed scholars for exegetical clarity though sometimes critiqued for charismatic-friendly emphases; has shaped contemporary treatments of Pauline soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a corrective to both Christ-only and Spirit-minimal theologies; invaluable for courses on Paul, pneumatology, and systematic treatments linking Christology and Spiritology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ ("in Christ")** - central Pauline idiom for believers' ontological participation; explained as Spirit-wrought.
- **Spirit of Christ / Christ in the Spirit** - phraseology indicating the Spirit as the locus of Christ's presence and activity.
- **Baptism by/into the Spirit** - the event/marker of entry into union with Christ and the eschatological community.
- **Resurrection by the Spirit** - the Spirit as agent of Christ's vindication and the believer's new life (Rom 8; 1 Cor 15 nexus).
- **Lordship of Christ** - present, exercised through the Spirit, not merely future eschatological status.
- **Justification and participation** - Fee emphasizes participatory dimensions alongside forensic language.
- **Sanctification / new creation** - pneumatological renewal that realizes Christ's redemptive effects in believers and community.
- **Pneumatological hermeneutic** - the method of reading Pauline Christological texts through the lens of the Spirit's activity.
- **Charismatic gifts / Spirit-empowerment** - functioning organically within Fee's scheme as manifestations of the Spirit's presence and proof of eschatological reality.
- **Eschatological presence** - the Spirit as the "already/not-yet" agent making Christ present now while awaiting consummation.
- **Covenant fulfillment** - Christ and Spirit as twin agents in the new covenant consummating Israel's hopes.
- **Indwelling / presence** - the Spirit as the immediate presence of Christ in believers and community.
- **Communal/ethical praxis** - ethical imperatives grounded in Spirit-enabled union and new-creation life.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for integrated Pauline Christology-pneumatology (useful in systematic theology entries on "union with Christ" and "pneumatology").
 - As a **polemic** against Christomonism and theological accounts that marginalize the Spirit.
 - As an **exegetical model** employed in NT courses and commentaries to read Pauline texts holistically.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics through the Spirit-mediated presence of Christ.
