### TITLE
Schleiermacher: Pioneer of Modern Theology (ed. Keith W. Clements) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century (principal work: Der christliche Glaube, 1821/22). Emerges from German Romanticism, post-Kantian philosophy (Kant, Fichte), and Enlightenment criticism of dogma.
 - Movement: formative for liberal Protestantism; attempt to reconcile Christianity with modern philosophy and historical scholarship.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must begin not with propositions but with the immediate religious consciousness: the "feeling of absolute dependence." Religion is a life and a mode of experience; doctrine is its systematic articulation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method - religious feeling as the foundation of theological method; critique of purely objective, propositional starting points.
 - Part II: Christology and revelation - Jesus as the archetype in whom the divine self-consciousness is revealed; revelation is historical event interpreted in religious experience.
 - Part III: Doctrinal system - doctrines (Trinity, sin, redemption, sacraments) are reconstructions of the religious life and its development.
 - Moves:
 - Positive redefinition of revelation from propositional content to existential encounter.
 - Re-theorizing authority: Scripture and tradition mediate, but do not replace, the primary datum of religious feeling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian critical philosophy, Fichtean subjectivity, Romantic hermeneutics; anticipates critiques from orthodox and later neo-orthodox thinkers (e.g., Barth).
 - Later receptions interact with historical-critical biblical scholarship and the rise of Biblical Theology as a descriptive discipline.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (mediatorship and exemplary model), Trinity (historical/relational), ecclesiology and sacraments (community and feeling), anthropology (religious consciousness), soteriology (restoration of religious life), dogmatic method.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Schleiermacher relocates theology from propositional certainties to the analysis and systematic expression of religious experience: theology as the reflective articulation of the soul's immediate relation to the divine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Primacy of religious experience ("Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhaengigkeit") over propositional revelation.
 - Theology as descriptive-expressive of communal and individual piety rather than forensic adjudication.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects Enlightenment deism by restoring a theologically serious account of religious feeling while rejecting pre-critical dogmatism.
 - Contrasts with classical Reformed emphases on covenant, forensic justification, and propositional Scripture; where scholastic theology centers juridical categories, Schleiermacher centers existential relation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematization of theology around consciousness; a proto-hermeneutical move that anticipates modern theological method and much of contemporary liberal theology.
 - Reframing of revelation as event-experience mediated by history and community.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for modern liberal Protestantism, historical-critical biblical theology, and theological hermeneutics.
 - Provoked corrective movements: 19th-20th c. conservative/neo-orthodox responses (e.g., Barth) who rejected subjectivism and reasserted objective divine revelation and justification.
 - In Reformed conversations (e.g., Federal Vision debates over covenant and justification), Schleiermacher is often cited negatively as emblematic of subjectivizing tendencies that Federal Vision critics associate with threats to forensic justification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies limits of doctrinal formulations by foregrounding religious life; indispensable for courses on modern theology, hermeneutics, and the history of theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - the basic datum of religion; immediate awareness of relation to the infinite.
- **Religious consciousness** - the soul's self-relation in which theology is grounded.
- **Revelation as event** - revelation understood primarily as historical encounter, then articulated doctrinally.
- **Dogmatics (systematic theology)** - reconstructed as reflective expression of religious life rather than compilation of propositions.
- **Christology as exemplar/mediator** - Jesus presents the perfect form of religious consciousness; salvific mediation is primarily ethical-spiritual.
- **Hermeneutical priority** - emphasis on interpretation; Scripture's authority is mediated by communal religious life.
- **Ecclesiology & sacramentality** - community-centered worship and sacraments as expressions of shared religious feeling, not mere juridical signs.
- **Subjectivity vs objectivity** - recurring tension: subjectivist grounding of faith contrasted with claims to objective propositional truth.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology** - Schleiermacher's method influenced the rise of Biblical Theology's descriptive-historical approach while recasting Systematic Theology as reflective expression; used in modern debates over whether theology should be reconstructive/descriptive or normative/systematic.
- **Justification / soteriology** - theological focus shifts from forensic imputation to transformation of religious life; used polemically against approaches (e.g., Federal Vision) that insist on covenantal efficacy and objective covenantal membership.
- **Romantic mediation** - synthesis of Romantic sensibility with theological method.
- **Philosophical interlocutor** - Kantian and Fichtean categories reworked for theological purposes.
- **Reception term: Schleiermacherianism** - shorthand for theological liberalism or subjectivism in later polemics.
- **Historicizing of doctrine** - doctrines treated as historical developments of consciousness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for liberal/modern theology and for methodological grounding in religious experience.
- As a **polemic target or foil** in debates over Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology and in controversies about justification (e.g., critiques invoked in discussions of the Federal Vision and justification-by-faith debates).
- As a **hermeneutical model** for courses on theological method and for reconstructive approaches to doctrinal loci.
