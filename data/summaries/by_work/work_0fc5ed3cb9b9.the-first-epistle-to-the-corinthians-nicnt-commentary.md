### TITLE
The First Epistle to the Corinthians (NICNT). Gordon D. Fee - focus: **The Spirit in Redemptive History**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - NICNT volume by Gordon D. Fee, first major modern English critical commentary on 1 Corinthians (late 20th century; Eerdmans). Written in the context of renewed evangelical interest in pneumatology and of debates over charismatic continuationism vs. cessationism.
 - Method: rigorous exegetical-linguistic work combined with socio-rhetorical and theological reading of Corinthian social context.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Paul's primary concern in 1 Corinthians is the proper place and function of the **Spirit** in the life and identity of the church - both as the decisive agent in redemptive history and as the basis for communal order, unity, and eschatological ethics.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Exegetical foundation: reads major Corinthian loci (gifts, wisdom, divisions, resurrection) through the prism of Pauline pneumatology. 
 - Chapters on gifts (chs. 12-14): gifts are Spirit-given, intended for corporate koinonia, to be exercised orderly and for edification. 
 - Wisdom and speaking (chs. 1-4, 2): contrasts worldly/philosophical wisdom with Spirit-revealed wisdom tied to Christ crucified and raised. 
 - Resurrection (ch. 15): Spirit as the power and guarantee of bodily resurrection and new creation. 
 - Theological move: the Spirit is not merely an individual mystical power but the **historical agent** inaugurating and guaranteeing the eschatological age - giving presence, unity, and ethical consequence to the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages contemporary Pauline scholarship (e.g., F. F. Bruce, C. K. Barrett) and debates with cessationist readings. Interacts methodologically with linguistic and socio-rhetorical critics; dialogues implicitly with Reformation and post-Reformation theological traditions on Spirit/Word relations.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology** (central), ecclesiology (unity, gifts, order), Christology (crucified/risen Lord as content of Spirit revelation), eschatology (resurrection, firstfruits/guarantee), ethics ( Spirit-shaped holiness), sacramental implications (Lord's Supper as communal Spirit-bound practice).

- **Closing line:** 
 - Fee's 1 Corinthians reads Paul as presenting the **Spirit as the decisive, historical power of redemption - the present guarantee and shape of the church's life, worship, and hope.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats the Spirit first as a **historical/eschatological agent** (not merely psychological or spiritualized piety). 
 - Emphasizes the communal aim of gifts: **koinonia and edification** over individual exhibition.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against both pietistic privatizations of the Spirit and against views that reduce gifts to mere cultural phenomena. 
 - Challenges cessationist readings by arguing continuity of Spirit-empowerment as normative for church life.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clear operational distinctions among **pneumatic (spiritual), psychical (natural), and sarkic (fleshly)** groupings in the Corinthian context as sociotheological categories, not merely moral descriptors. 
 - Repeated use of **Spirit as "guarantee/arrabon"** language to tie pneumatology to redemptive-historical promise and eschatological fulfillment.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Highly influential in evangelical and charismatic circles as an exegetical warrant for continuationism and for ordering charismatic practice. 
 - Used widely in academic Pauline studies as a model of integrating rigorous exegesis with theological synthesis; critiqued by some conservative scholars for emphases on experiential aspects.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Exemplary model of exegetical-theological engagement on pneumatology; indispensable for courses on Paul, pneumatology, and ecclesial practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit (pneuma):** the active agent of redemption, giver of gifts, source of unity and eschatological life. 
- **Charismata (gifts):** Spirit-given capacities for communal service and building up the church; normative and ordered. 
- **Pneumatic / Psychical / Sarkic:** sociotheological typology distinguishing Spirit-led community vs. merely natural or fleshly orientations. 
- **Wisdom (sophia) vs. knowledge (gnosis):** contrast between Spirit-revealed wisdom centered on the cross and secular/Philosophical wisdom. 
- **Koinonia (fellowship/participation):** communal life shaped by the Spirit; context for sacramental and ethical practice. 
- **Arrabon / guarantee / firstfruits:** Spirit as the present pledge of future resurrection and full redemption. 
- **Ordered worship / prophecy vs. tongues:** Fee emphasizes prophecy (edifying, intelligible speech) as normative in public worship, with tongues subordinated to order. 
- **Resurrection (anastasis):** bodily resurrection grounded in Spirit-power; theological climax tying pneumatology to eschatology. 
- **Sanctification (holiness):** ethical outcome of Spirit indwelling - communal holiness expressed in relations and worship. 
- **Ecclesiology (church unity/divisions):** divisions diagnosed in terms of failure to recognize Spirit-defined identity in Christ. 
- **Redemptive history (salvation-historical reading):** the Spirit as the present agent who inaugurates the eschatological age promised in Scripture. 
- **Edification (oikodome):** primary telos for gifts and speech in the assembly. 
- **Pauline pneumatology (overall):** integrated view where Spirit, Christ, and resurrection interlock as the basis for Christian life.

- **Uses across loci:** 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts with linguistic and socio-rhetorical precision. 
 - As a **polemic and resource** for continuationist pneumatology and for shaping ordered charismatic practice. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking pneumatology to eschatology, ecclesiology, and ethics in redemptive-historical theology.
