### TITLE
The Presbyterian Conflict (1937) - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid the 1930s crisis in the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. (PCUSA): modernist/liberal ascendancy, the 1933 Auburn Affirmation, and controversies over missionary boards and ordination. Machen writes after founding the Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions (1933) and during the ecclesiastical prosecutions that culminated in his suspension/deposition (mid‑1930s).
 - Theological milieu: clash between historic Reformed orthodoxy (confessionalism, biblical authority) and theological liberalism/modernist accommodation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church must be faithful to historic Christian doctrine as defined by Scripture and the confessions; when denominational structures refuse or fail to uphold that fidelity, faithful Christians are morally and ecclesiologically justified in organizing alternative witness and discipline.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: the PCUSA has increasingly capitulated to modernism, undermining Scripture, the doctrines of Christ and atonement, and confessional subscription.
 - Legal and ecclesial critique: denominational courts and procedures are being used to suppress orthodoxy rather than defend doctrine.
 - Practical prescription: defense of confessional subscription, defense of independent missions (as a biblical imperative), and the legitimacy of separation when a church abandons its doctrinal standards.
 - Appeal to historic ecclesiology and creedal identity as normative checks on organizational or procedural abuses.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opponents: proponents of the Auburn Affirmation and modernist theologians within the PCUSA; denominational jurists enforcing centralizing measures.
 - Sources: Scripture, Westminster Standards, historic creeds (implicit appeal to the classical creedal formula "one holy catholic and apostolic church"), and Reformation tradition (as the ecclesiological yardstick).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Authority and inspiration of Scripture; Christology and substitutionary atonement; the nature and marks of the true Church; confessional subscription; mission and ecclesiastical order; covenantal identity implicit throughout.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The integrity of the church is rooted in fidelity to biblical doctrine and confessional standards; ecclesial structures exist to serve that fidelity, not to subvert it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong practical linkage of doctrine to ecclesial practice: orthodoxy is not merely propositional assent but requires institutional protection and institutional witness (e.g., missions).
 - Robust defense of separation as a theological duty when a church ceases to function as a confessing body.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with 19th-20th century accommodationist approaches that reframed Christian doctrine in modernist terms; rejects procedural legalism that privileges organization over creed.
 - Distinguishes himself from isolationist fundamentalists by insisting on ordered, confessional alternatives (not merely private sectarianism).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes the Reformation idea of the church's marks into a modern denominational critique-using confessional subscription as a practical test for church identity.
 - Treats mission boards and foreign missions as ecclesiological litmus tests (if missions are compromised, the denomination's claim to be the true church is suspect).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate impact: galvanized conservative Presbyterians, contributed to the formation and identity of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and other conservative bodies.
 - Longer term: a canonical text for confessionalist argumentation; frequently cited in debates about ecclesial discipline, denominational fidelity, and the legitimacy of separation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact case study in applying Reformation ecclesiology to denominational crises; useful for understanding 20th‑century confessional revival and the workings of ecclesiastical courage in the face of institutional apostasy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Auburn Affirmation**
 - The 1933 statement defending doctrinal latitude within PCUSA; Machen treats it as symptomatic of liberal capitulation.
- **Confessional subscription**
 - The binding authority of the Westminster Standards (and creeds) for ministers and courts; central for Machen's ecclesiology.
- **Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions**
 - Machen's mission board; exemplar of legitimate separation to preserve doctrinal purity in mission work.
- **General Assembly (PCUSA)**
 - Institutional locus of conflict-accused of enforcing liberalizing discipline and legalistic suppression of orthodoxy.
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church**
 - Creedal formula appealed to by Machen as the standard of continuity with historic Christianity; used to criticize novel denominational claims when doctrine is abandoned.
 - Machen reads the phrase in light of Reformation ecclesiology rather than as a juridical monopoly claim.
- **Reformation ecclesiology**
 - Framework emphasizing Word, sacraments, and proper preaching as marks of the true church; Machen mobilizes this to adjudicate denominational legitimacy.
- **Modernism / theological liberalism**
 - Target category for critique-undermines Scripture, atonement, and confessional standards.
- **Fundamentalism**
 - Related movement; Machen overlaps with its doctrinal commitments but differs tactically in confessional and ordered responses.
- **Schism / Separation**
 - Ethical and ecclesiological category; Machen reframes separation as a last resort, morally required when truth is abandoned.
- **Ecclesiastical jurisdiction**
 - Criticized when used to suppress doctrinal fidelity rather than enforce confessional standards.
- **Mission as test**
 - Missions used as practical thermometer of doctrinal health-compromised missions indicate a compromised church.
- **Orthodoxy**
 - Defined by historical creeds and confessions, not merely majority vote or administrative decision.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic**: principled justification for denominational separation and for independent mission enterprises.
 - As a **definition source**: clarifying confessional subscription and a Reformation-derived ecclesiology for contemporary controversies.
 - As a **historical/exegetical model**: case study in how doctrine, polity, and mission interact when a church faces internal theological collapse.
