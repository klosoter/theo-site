### TITLE
The Person of Christ - Cornelius Van Til (article in The New Bible Dictionary)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century evangelical-Reformed milieu; Van Til writing as a systematic and apologetic theologian within Presbyterian circles and the broader Christian Reformed response to liberal theology and neo-orthodoxy.
 - Contribution to a popular scholarly reference (The New Bible Dictionary) designed for pastors and students; compresses Van Til's presuppositional commitments into a compact Christological entry.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend classical Chalcedonian Christology against modern reductions (e.g., kenoticism, liberal moral exemplar theories) by placing the hypostatic union and the person of Christ at the center of Christian epistemology and soteriology.
 - Insists that the two natures are united in one person without confusion, and that this union determines both the possibility of atoning work and the non-possibility of sinning (impeccability).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the two natures (divine, human) in one hypostasis as biblical and necessary for revelation and redemption.
 - Explication of the communicatio idiomatum: predicates from each nature may be ascribed to the one person, but properties do not transfer so as to confuse natures.
 - Practical consequence: statements about Christ's human experiences do not imply moral fallibility of the divine person.
 - Defense of the **impeccability of Christ**: because the divine will is united to the human person, and the divine will is necessarily holy, the incarnate person could not sin.
 - Polemical moves against:
 - Liberal reduction of Christ to moral teacher.
 - Kenotic accounts that posit self-emptying as loss of divine attributes in a way that endangers revelation and atonement.
 - Brief theological consequences: Christ as the ontological ground of reconciliation, the normative epistemic center for knowledge of God.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Scripture and classical ecumenical councils (Athanasius, Council of Chalcedon).
 - Engages (implicitly or explicitly) medieval scholastic distinctions, Reformed orthodox formulations, and contemporaries such as Barth and liberal theologians.
 - Uses presuppositional apologetic method as background warrant.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and natures), Trinity, revelation, atonement, sin and human nature, divine immutability and will, pastoral/epistemic implications.

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til locates the person of Christ as the indispensable, revelatory center: the one eternal Son, truly God and truly man, whose united person secures both authoritative knowledge of God and an efficacious, sinless atonement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Christology is presented not merely as speculative doctrine but as the presuppositional foundation for theology and apologetics - the incarnate person grounds both revelation and rational knowledge.
 - Strong insistence on **impeccability**: the incarnate person could not sin because of essential union with the divine will.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against kenotic and liberal accounts that degrade divine attributes or make Christ morally fallible.
 - Critiques approaches that treat communicatio idiomatum casually; insists on disciplined use to avoid modalism or Nestorianism.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Integrates presuppositional epistemology with classical Christological categories: e.g., using communicatio idiomatum not only doctrinally but as an epistemic claim about how God is known in history.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly valued within presuppositional and conservative Reformed circles as a compact, defensible articulation.
 - Less influential among mainline and non-Reformed scholars who prioritize different epistemologies or more historically critical methods.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to modernizations of Christology; clarifies how doctrinal precision (hypostatic union, impeccability, communicatio idiomatum) sustains both worship and apologetic confidence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - The personal union of two distinct natures (divine and human) in the one person of the Son; central structuring concept.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - The lawful attribution of properties of either nature to the one person; Van Til stresses precision so attributes are ascribed without confusion of natures.
 - Use: explains how human experiences of Christ (e.g., hunger) and divine acts (e.g., forgiving sins) can be spoken of the one person.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - The doctrine that Christ could not sin; argued from the inseparable union of the divine will with the incarnate person.
- **Kenosis** - Self-emptying (Phil 2); criticized when read as loss of divine attributes or as implying moral vulnerability.
- **Person vs. Nature** - Distinction emphasized to avoid Nestorian separation or Eutychian fusion; person = who acts, nature = what is acted from.
- **Revelational Epistemology / Presuppositionalism** - Knowledge of God must begin with the divine self-disclosure in Christ; Christ is the epistemic presupposition for theology.
- **Atonement (soteriological implications)** - The efficacy of Christ's work depends on his full divinity and true humanity united in one sinless person.
- **Divine Will / Immutability** - Used to support impeccability; the unchanging holy will of God as determining the moral impossibility of sin in Christ.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The touchstone formulation Van Til defends and applies interpretively.
- **Moral Exemplarism (rejected)** - The view that Jesus' primary value is as moral example; Van Til insists this reduces the ontological and soteriological claims.
- **Athanasius / Patristic appeal** - Cited implicitly as authoritative historical support for orthodox insistence on both natures fully present.
- **Twofold Office (King, Prophet, Priest)** - Background soteriological framework presupposed by Van Til's Christology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **concise definitional source** for orthodox Christology in pastoral and classroom settings.
 - As a **polemic and apologetic model**: used to counter kenoticism, liberal reductions, and to ground a presuppositional defense of Scripture and divine revelation.
 - As an **exegetical touchstone** for applying communicatio idiomatum carefully in preaching and doctrine.
