### TITLE
**Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?** - Oscar Cullmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Postwar European theology (late 1940s-1950s), within the biblical theology and salvation-history (Heilsgeschichte) movement; reacting to Hellenizing tendencies in Christian doctrine and to existential demythologizing (Bultmann).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament does not teach the Greek doctrine of the soul's natural immortality; it proclaims the resurrection of the dead grounded in the historical death and resurrection of Jesus, in which death is the last enemy, not a friend or natural release.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Contrast between **Socrates** (Plato, Phaedo) who serenely welcomes death as liberation, and **Jesus** who confronts death as a fearful enemy; this contrast clarifies the biblical stance on death.
 - **Biblical survey:** OT Sheol and prophetic hope; apocalyptic Judaism (e.g., 2 Macc 7) moving toward resurrection; NT climax in 1 Cor 15, 1 Thess 4, John 11, and Rev 20-21.
 - **Christological center:** Christ's resurrection as firstfruits and pledge of ours; union with Christ, not an immortal substance, secures personal continuity.
 - **Anthropology:** Human beings are a psychosomatic unity; Scripture does not ground hope in an immortal soul but in God's act to raise the dead.
 - **Intermediate state:** Provisional, often metaphorized as sleep; genuine communion with Christ yet awaiting bodily resurrection.
 - **Eschatological framework:** Salvation history that is already inaugurated through Christ and the Spirit yet awaits consummation at the Parousia; the Church lives in this tension.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Plato and Hellenistic dualism; apocalyptic Judaism; Paul and John; early Fathers (Irenaeus vs. Origen); Reformers (Luther's death-as-sleep tendency); modern dialogue with Barth and Bultmann.
- **Doctrines treated:** Eschatology, anthropology, soteriology, Christology, Scripture and tradition, ecclesiology (hope and comfort of the Church).
- **Closing line:** Christian hope rests not in an indestructible soul but in the **faithful God who raises the dead** through the crucified and risen Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Death as the last enemy, not a doorway; the Gospel is resurrection, not escape.
 - Salvation-history time: linear narrative climaxing in Christ, resisting cyclical or timeless metaphysics.
 - Pastoral realism: the terror of death is acknowledged; comfort is Christological, not metaphysical.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Critiques **Platonic** immortality and Origenist spiritualizing; distinguishes biblical hope from Hellenistic dualism.
 - Nuances existential demythologizing by insisting on the historicity of resurrection.
 - Challenges Christian rhetoric that collapses hope into the intermediate state, re-centering final resurrection.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Repopularizes Heilsgeschichte and the already/not-yet schema; foregrounds firstfruits and arrabon (pledge) to describe present assurance.
 - Frames the intermediate state as provisional communion, not ultimate fulfillment.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Catalyzed mid-20th-century reorientation toward bodily resurrection (influencing Pannenberg, Moltmann, and later N. T. Wright).
 - In Reformed circles, sharpened holistic anthropology and eschatology; prompted debate with dualist defenders (e.g., analytic and evangelical philosophers).
 - Provoked ecumenical discussion with Roman Catholic theology on immortality and resurrection's priority.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear diagnostic tool to separate biblical hope from cultural-philosophical accretions.
 - Pastoral resource on death, funerals, and catechesis; exegetical map for 1 Cor 15 and 1 Thess 4.
 - Conceptual bridge between eschatology, anthropology, and Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection of the dead:** Bodily, historical act of God patterned on Christ's rising; the Christian hope.
- **Immortality of the soul:** Greek-derived claim of innate indestructibility; denied as biblical foundation of hope.

- **Last enemy (death):** Pauline designation stressing death's hostility to God's life-giving work.
- **Firstfruits:** Christ's resurrection as pledge and pattern of believers' resurrection.
- **Arrabon / pledge of the Spirit:** Present guarantee of future resurrection life.
- **Intermediate state:** Provisional condition of the dead in Christ; real communion, not final perfection.
 - Sleep metaphor signals awaiting resurrection; counters triumphalism about death.
- **Psychosomatic unity:** Human person as integrated body-soul; no separable immortal core.
- **Parousia:** Christ's return that consummates salvation and raises the dead.
- **New creation:** Eschatological renewal of cosmos tied to bodily resurrection.
- **Sheol / Hades:** Biblical background for death's realm; transformed by Christ's victory.
