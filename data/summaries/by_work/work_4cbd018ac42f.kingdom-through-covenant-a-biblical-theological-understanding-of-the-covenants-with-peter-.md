### TITLE
**Kingdom through Covenant: A Biblical-Theological Understanding of the Covenants** (Peter J. Gentry & Stephen J. Wellum)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century (Crossway, 2012); emerges in the milieu of renewed interest in biblical theology among conservative evangelicals and contemporary debates within Reformed and dispensational traditions.
 - Part of a movement seeking an integrated biblical-theological framework that is pastorally useful and academically rigorous.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Bible's grand storyline is the unfolding of the **kingdom of God** through a progressive series of **covenants** (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and the New Covenant). These covenants provide the structural unity for biblical theology and are fulfilled in Christ, who inaugurates and secures the kingdom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological premise: **biblical theology** (historical, canonical reading) should govern systematic formulations; theology must track promise-fulfillment patterns.
 - Exposition of each covenant as a distinct historical administration of the one covenantal plan of God.
 - Each covenant contains elements of promise, demand, and sign/seat of the kingdom; each point forward typologically to Christ and consummation.
 - The Old-New Testamental relationship is continuity-with-development: continuity in promise and peoplehood; legitimate discontinuity in form and administration.
 - Eschatology and church identity flow from covenantal promise-fulfillment, not from a radical separation of Israel and the Church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Reformed covenant theologians, dispensationalists, and biblical theologians.
 - Specific interlocutors/topic sites:
 - **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology**: argues for priority of the biblical-theological narrative as the foundation for systematic claims.
 - **Dispensationalism and Progressive Covenantalism**: sets out a corrective to dispensational separations of Israel and Church and articulates Progressive Covenantalism as an alternative.
 - **Biblical Covenants**: close exegesis of covenant texts across Torah, Prophets, and Psalms.
 - **Klinean Covenant Theology and Intrusion Ethics**: interacts with Meredith Kline's formulations, pressing on the ethical and covenantal implications of covenant "intrusion."

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant (structure and typology), Christology, kingdom, ecclesiology, eschatology, continuity/discontinuity of promise, sacraments as covenant signs.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically centripetal claim: **the kingdom-of-God motif mediated through covenants is the canonical key that unifies Scripture and centers Christ as the consummation of divine promise.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the **kingdom** as the organizing theme and the **covenants** as the structural framework - not merely legal transactions but stages in the reign and rule of God.
 - Robust use of canonical-historical method: seeks to read covenants within the whole story of Scripture rather than isolated proof-texting.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects classic dispensationalism by denying a hard Israel/church divide and by reinterpreting promise-fulfillment as continuity with typological development.
 - Modifies some classical federal/Klinean emphases: affirms covenantal structure while cautioning against over-systematic applications of Kline's intrusion ethics and an overly rigid covenant-of-works schema.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and refined the label **Progressive Covenantalism** (a mediating position emphasizing progressive revelation and covenantal unity).
 - Recasts covenant elements in terms of **promise-demand-sign** dynamic to highlight theological pacing toward Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles as a principal modern defense of a covenanted biblical-theological center.
 - Stimulated debates with dispensationalists and prompted further work refining covenantal categories and ecclesial implications.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear exegetical-to-systematic pipeline useful for preaching, teaching, and further academic work on covenantal theology and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**: The central, unifying theme; God's reign revealed progressively through covenants and consummated in Christ.
- **Covenant**: Constitutional-stageings of God's redemptive rule; each covenant has **promise, demand, sign**.
- **Progressive Covenantalism**: The authors' preferred framework-unity of covenantal plan with historical progress and typological development.
- **Promise-Fulfillment Motif**: Repeated pattern by which prior covenants point forward to fuller realization in later covenants and in Christ.
- **Typology**: Canonical method reading earlier persons/events as divinely instituted foreshadowings fulfilled in Christ.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace**: Treated historically; authors affirm traditional categories but nuance how they are located and spoken of across Scripture.
- **Davidic Covenant**: Central to kingship/kingdom promises; a key locus for Christological fulfillment.
- **New Covenant**: Culminating covenant in which Christ mediates the definitive kingdom; continuity with prior promises in form and substance.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity**: Balanced hermeneutic stressing substantive continuity in promises and peoplehood with discontinuities in administration and form.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology**: Methodological priority to biblical-theological narrative as corrective and foundation for systematics.
- **Dispensationalism**: Primary foil-book argues against its sharp Israel/church split and separate eschatological programs.
- **Klinean Covenant Theology**: Engaged critically-respects Kline's insights while disputing some ethical and schematic overextensions (e.g., intrusion ethics as applied).
- **Intrusion Ethics**: The idea that covenant intrusion places divine obligation into human realm; Gentry & Wellum interact with and moderate this concept.
- **People of God**: Covenantal identity maintained across covenants; ecclesiology flows from this sustained peoplehood.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for covenantal stages and the kingdom motif.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational separations and some Klinean formulations.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Old Testament covenants in canonical context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology based on covenantal promise-fulfillment.
