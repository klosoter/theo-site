### TITLE
Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow - Yuval Noah Harari (2015 Hebrew; 2016/2017 English)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written by a historian amid 2010s debates about Big Data, AI, CRISPR, and transhumanism. Emerges from Harari's synthetic "big history" method (following Sapiens), situated in post-enlightenment secular humanist and transhumanist milieus; aimed at a broad public and policy audience rather than theological specialists.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Contemporary humanism is producing its own successors - technologies and ideologies (notably "dataism") that may supplant human-centered meaning, agency, and moral authority. The chief problem: what happens to meaning, dignity, and salvation when intelligence and decision-making detach from conscious human agents?
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnosis: Historical forces (cognitive, agricultural, scientific revolutions) moved humans from powerless to godlike control over life and death.
 - Projection: Technological trajectories (AI, genetic engineering, algorithmic analysis) aim to accomplish classical divine prerogatives (immortality, happiness, omniscience), producing "Homo Deus" or post-human entities.
 - Analysis: Emergence of new ideologies - especially **dataism** - that revalue information flows above individual narratives, emotions, and traditional religious vocabularies.
 - Consequences: Possible erosion of human agency, rise of a new elite of engineered or algorithmically empowered beings, and the emergence of a "useless class" of humans whose jobs and decision-making capacities are outsourced to algorithms.
 - Ethical stakes: Urgent questions about meaning, inequality, and the moral ordering of societies in the face of radical technological change.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Darwinian evolution; Enlightenment humanists; scientific revolutionaries; contemporary technologists and futurists (e.g., proponents of singularity/transhumanism); economists and data scientists by inference. Harari uses anthropological, biological, economic, and computational sources rather than theological ones.
- **Doctrines treated (implicitly or explicitly):**
 - **Anthropology/Imago Dei:** Reframed as a historical achievement rather than an ontological given; human dignity questioned by algorithmic valuation.
 - **Eschatology/Salvation:** Secular eschatologies imagined via techno-utopian promises (immortality, bliss) and dystopias (loss of meaning).
 - **Providence/Teleology:** Replaces providential narratives with mechanistic, algorithmic "designs" and probabilistic forecasting.
 - **Soul/consciousness:** Problematized by functionalist accounts; consciousness may be decoupled from value.
 - **Ethics and worship:** Shifts from narrative-based moralities to value derived from information processing and performance metrics.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Homo Deus operates as a secular eschatology: a diagnosis and warning that post-human technologies and the rise of dataist worship may displace traditional theological claims about human meaning, agency, and destiny.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Coining and popularizing **dataism** as a candidate successor to humanist religion - the idea that the supreme moral and epistemic value is the free flow and processing of data.
 - Framing the technological future not only as progress but as a religious and existential displacement.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts with liberal humanist optimism by highlighting risks of dehumanization and systemic inequality.
 - Moves beyond techno-utopian singularity narratives by situating them within socio-political power structures and evolutionary contingencies.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Homo Deus" as shorthand for engineered, data-augmented post-humans claiming godlike capacities.
 - "Useless class" to describe humans marginalized by automation and predictive algorithms.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Broad secular reach; theologians (including Reformed scholars) have used the book as a foil to reflect on imago Dei, eschatology, and the ethics of technology.
 - Not a theological treatise; reception is often critical but engaged - valued for raising pastoral and doctrinal questions rather than offering theological answers.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provocative supplemental text for courses on theological anthropology, eschatology, ethics of technology, and public theology.
 - Serves as a contemporary cultural document prompting theological responses to data-driven modernity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Homo Deus:** Post-human being with godlike capacities (immortality, bliss, omniscience) achieved via biotech and AI.
- **Dataism:** The emergent creed that places supreme value on information flow and algorithmic processing as the highest arbiter of truth and moral worth.
- **Humanism (liberal/romantic):** The prevailing modern ideology that centers human experience, autonomy, and meaning - portrayed as both culprit and victim of technological change.
- **Algorithmic authority:** The transfer of decision-making and value judgments to predictive models and machine processes.
- **Useless class:** A socio-economic category of humans whose labor and decision-making are rendered obsolete by automation.
- **Consciousness vs. computation:** The distinction problematized - Harari foregrounds functional outputs over subjective qualia, risking the devaluation of consciousness as normative ground.
- **Evolutionary teleology:** Historical processes reframed as purposive trajectories toward greater control and information-processing capacity rather than theological ends.
- **Transhumanism/biotech enhancements:** Technologies aimed at augmenting human capacities; central to Harari's forecasts of inequality and new ethics.
- **Secular eschatology:** Non-theological visions of "end times" centered on technological fulfillment or catastrophe.
- **Meaning narratives / myths:** Human stories that conferred identity and purpose; argued to be vulnerable to replacement by data-driven prescriptions.
- **Imago Dei (implicit critique):** The theological claim of human dignity is challenged when value is measured by data-processing or utility.
- **Predictive algorithms:** Engines of social control and economic allocation in Harari's projections.
- **Singularity (implicitly):** The speculative threshold where AI qualitatively outstrips human capacities.
- **Ethical externalities:** Social and moral consequences of technological advancement that theology must address.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in theological anthropology courses to grapple with posthuman challenges to imago Dei.
 - As **polemic/resource** in public theology and ethics for critiquing uncritical technological optimism and laying out pastoral stakes.
 - As a **case study** in eschatology and systematic theology for imagining non-theistic "salvations" and their implications for doctrine and worship.
