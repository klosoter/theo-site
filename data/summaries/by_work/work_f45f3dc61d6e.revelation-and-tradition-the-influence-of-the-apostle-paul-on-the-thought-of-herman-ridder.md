### TITLE
Revelation and Tradition: The Influence of the Apostle Paul on the Thought of Herman Ridderbos (WTJ, 1976) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1970s Reformed and evangelical reassessment of Pauline theology; engagement with Dutch Neo-Calvinist scholarship. Gaffin writes as a conservative Reformed exegete seeking to introduce and critique Herman Ridderbos for an Anglo-American audience.
 - Intellectual milieu: response to Bultmannian demythologizing, Barthian dialectical theology, and liberal historicism; emphasis on Scripture's apostolic witness and Christ-centered revelation.

- **Central thesis**
 - Ridderbos reads Paul as the decisive hermeneutical key: revelation is a historical, Christ-centered act that is mediated apostolically; tradition must be evaluated by its fidelity to this apostolic-revelatory event. Gaffin contends Ridderbos's appropriation of Paul recovers a thoroughly Christocentric and historically grounded theology of revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical premise: Paul's writings centrally portray revelation as accomplished in the person and work of Christ and disclosed by the Spirit.
 - Theological construction: Ridderbos moves from Pauline exegesis to doctrinal formulations on incarnation, covenant-historical continuity, eschatology, and the epistemology of knowing God.
 - Revelation as event rather than mere propositions; Scripture is the witness to that event.
 - Tradition is a servile transmission (apostolic norm), not an independent source of revelation.
 - Accommodation: God condescends in revelation and in the incarnation to sinful, finite human capacities.
 - Polemical target: theological systems that detach revelation from historical, apostolic, Christological grounding (e.g., existentialist readings and certain liberal historicisms).

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary: Herman Ridderbos (Dutch Reformed), Apostle Paul (as interpreted by Ridderbos).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Rudolf Bultmann, Karl Barth (indirectly), and the broader Reformed tradition (e.g., Vos, Kuyperic strands).
 - Gaffin brings Reformed confessional concerns into dialogue with Ridderbos's Pauline exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical-act), Scripture (apostolic witness), incarnation and accommodation, Christology, covenant theology (history-fulfillment model), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), soteriology (union with Christ, justification), pneumatology (Spirit as epistemic witness).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Ridderbos, as Gaffin presents him, anchors Reformed theology by reading Paul so that revelation is a historically accomplished, incarnational event mediated by apostolic proclamation and the Spirit - making epistemology and tradition subservient to the Christ-event.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Revelation conceived primarily as a historical, salvific act in Christ rather than abstract doctrine or propositional content alone.
 - Strong linking of Pauline eschatology with covenant-history: fulfillment of promise is interpretive key for Old-New Testament continuity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters Bultmann's existentialized Paul by insisting on the historicity and objectivity of the revelation-event.
 - Distances from liberal accounts that relativize apostolic authority or reduce revelation to religious experience.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on the apostolic sermon as normative "tradition" - tradition defined functionally as faithful transmission of the Pauline-Christological event.
 - Synthesis of "accommodation" with incarnational logic: revelation is both condescending and genuinely revelatory, not merely pedagogical.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Gaffin's essay contributed to wider Anglo-Reformed recovery of Ridderbos, shaping conservative Pauline theology and theological epistemology debates.
 - Influential in conversations about Scripture's authority, the role of tradition, and the place of historical revelation in systematic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how a rigorous Pauline hermeneutic reorients systematic loci (revelation, Christology, covenant, pneumatology).
 - Serves as a corrective to approaches that either spiritualize revelation or detach doctrine from historical event.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (openbaring)** - primarily an historical, incarnational act in Christ, disclosed apostolically and witnessed by the Spirit.
- **Apostolicity / Tradition** - tradition is legitimate only as faithful transmission of apostolic proclamation; not a parallel source of revelation.
- **Accommodation (aanpassing)** - divine condescension in both incarnation and revelation; God adapts revelation to human capacities without relinquishing divine truth.
 - Related: **incarnational analogy** - the incarnation exemplifies the pattern and limits of revelation's accommodation.
- **Historical-evental revelation** - the idea that what is revealed is a concrete salvific event, not merely abstract propositions.
- **Eschatology (inaugurated)** - present reality of Christ's reign with future consummation; shapes reading of covenant history.
- **Union with Christ** - soteriological center linking justification, sanctification, and eschatological hope.
- **Pneumatological epistemology** - genuine knowledge of God is Spirit-witnessed and mediated through Christ and Scripture, against purely natural theology.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - Paul provides the hermeneutical key; Christ is the interpretive center of Scripture and tradition.
- **Scripture as witness** - Scripture bears witness to the revelation-event; its authority rests on apostolic witness and Spirit-empowerment.
- **Propositional vs. evental knowledge** - Ridderbos (via Gaffin) privileges evental, existentially efficacious revelation over reduction to mere propositions.
- **Covenant-historical continuity** - promise-fulfillment schema governs redemptive-historical interpretation.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for revelation as historic-act (revelation locus) and for framing accommodation relative to incarnation.
 - As a **polemic** against demythologizing and liberal epistemologies (epistemology and the knowledge of God).
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline theology emphasizing Christ/event-centered reading of Scripture and tradition.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on proclamation, tradition, and the interplay of incarnation and accommodation in theology.
