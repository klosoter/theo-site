### TITLE
**B.B. Warfield - "The Human Development of Jesus" (in The Person and Work of Christ)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton theology; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed response to liberal and speculative Christologies. Engages nineteenth-century historical criticism, kenotic theories, and patristic/medieval traditions.
- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus truly assumed a human nature capable of genuine development (growth in knowledge, experience, and moral testing) while remaining personally sinless; his humanity is authentic but not infected by original sin in the way fallen humanity is.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes the reality of Christ's human development from Scriptural data (e.g., Luke 2:52; experiential temptations).
 - Distinguishes between human constitution (natural capacities, susceptibility to physical consequence) and moral culpability - Christ shared the former but not the latter.
 - Rejects theories that either:
 - Make Christ passively accumulate moral defect through heredity or preexistence, or
 - Reduce his development to merely apparent or cosmetic.
 - Affirms that Christ's growth is compatible with the doctrine of impeccability understood as moral inability to sin only inasmuch as God's hypostatic union and divine guidance preserve him from personal sin.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine and Calvin on sin and original guilt, Athanasius and Chalcedonian formulations on the incarnation, contemporary kenotic theologians, and sceptical historical-critical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and nature union), sin (nature/origin), original sin and imputation, the Fall and its consequences, image of God (imago Dei), temptation and perfection.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the argument: **Christ is the genuinely developing human who, by virtue of the hypostatic union and his unique relation to the Father, enacts and restores the true imago Dei without ever personally falling into sin.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful parsing of *development* vs. *degeneration*: development is growth toward the created end (perfection) rather than progress from innocence to corruption.
 - Strong insistence on the real continuity of Christ's human nature with ours (physical constitution, experience) while preserving divine preservation from sin.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against kenotic readings that imply divine self-emptying reduces divine attributes so as to render Christ capable of personal sin.
 - Counters liberal reconstructions that make Jesus morally exemplary but ontologically ordinary; insists on singularity grounded in the hypostatic union.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced distinction between inherited *corruption* and relational consequences of the Fall; careful language to separate juridical imputation from ontological contagion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical Christology as a clarifying foil to both liberal historicism and speculative kenoticism.
 - Used widely in systematic treatments to preserve both genuine human experience and doctrinal sinlessness.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for integrating biblical exegesis, historical dogma, and theological anthropology; remains a pedagogical staple for advanced Christology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Human development of Jesus** - Growth in wisdom, stature, and favor; genuine experiential maturation without moral failure.
- **Sinlessness** - Personal absence of sin in Christ; not mere lack of committed acts but moral impeccability grounded in the hypostatic union.
- **Impeccability (vs. impossibility of sin)** - Warfield balances: Christ could be tempted (real freedom) but did not sin because of divine preservation.
- **Kenosis (critique)** - Rejected when it implies real loss of divine attributes or exposes Christ to moral fallibility.
- **Original sin** - Distinguished between hereditary corruption and juridical guilt; Christ assumes human nature but not the taint of inherited guilt. (Original Sin And Imputation)
- **Imputation** - Twofold language:
 - Negative: the non-imputation of Adamic guilt to Christ.
 - Positive: Christ as the righteous federal representative whose obedience is imputed to believers. (Original Sin And Imputation)
- **Nature and origin of sin** - Sin rooted in willful revolt, not merely constitutional imperfection; so Christ's human constitution need not entail moral culpability. (Nature And Origin Of Sin)
- **The Fall and its consequences** - Warfield maps which consequences Christ assumed (mortality, weakness) and which liabilities he did not (personal guilt). (The Fall And Its Consequences)
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - Christ as the perfect image and archetype restoring what the Fall marred; his development manifests the true end of human nature. (Image Of God)
- **Hypostatic union** - The decisive metaphysical ground for both Christ's sinlessness and genuine human experience.
- **Temptation** - Real and formative; serves to confirm moral perfection rather than threaten fatal lapse.
- **Federal headship** - Christ as second Adam whose obedience reverses Adamic failure.
- **Perfection** - Not static sterilization but realized maturity in filial dependence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Christ's human growth and sinlessness in advanced Christology modules.
- As a **polemic** against kenotic and liberal reconstructions that compromise divine-human integrity.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Gospel data on Jesus' growth and temptation genuinely, not allegorically.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates linking original sin, imputation, and the ontological status of Christ's assumed human nature.
