### TITLE
**Covenant Theology** - John M. Frame, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Christian Belief (selected treatment)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed systematic theology (early 21st century). Frame writes within a broadly conservative, confessional Reformed milieu but conversant with recent covenantal debates (notably Meredith G. Kline).
 - A synthetic, pastoral-systematic presentation that integrates doctrine and ethics using Frame's broader theological method (e.g., lordship and triperspectival concerns).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The covenants are the fundamental structuring principle for understanding revelation, law, and salvation history; one must preserve both continuity and discontinuity among covenants without collapsing law and gospel.
 - Defends classical Reformed covenantal categories (Covenant of Works, Covenant of Grace) while critiquing Klinean revisions (e.g., intrusion ethics and certain readings of the Mosaic covenant).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of covenant categories (works/grace), federal headship, and covenant administration across redemptive history.
 - Argues that the Mosaic covenant must be understood relationally: it had a works-character in its stipulations yet functioned under the economy of the Covenant of Grace.
 - Critiques Kline's attempt to recast Mosaic law and covenant obligations as an "intrusion" ethics that destabilizes the law/gospel distinction.
 - Emphasizes God's lordship covenant as the theological key: law is covenantal and comprehensive for life under God, but its saving center is Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed sources (Westminster tradition, Calvin), Vos on redemptive-historical method, and contemporary interlocutors, most notably Meredith G. Kline (on Mosaic covenant and intrusion ethics).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (central), revelation, law (moral, civil, ceremonial), soteriology (federal headship, justification), Christology (mediatorial fulfillment), ethics and ecclesiology.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame locates covenant theology as the engine that holds together law, gospel, and ethics under the sovereign lordship of God, resisting innovations that sever covenantal continuity or obscure Christ as the covenantal center.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stress on **God's lordship** as the governing category for covenant: covenant obligations express God's comprehensive claim over life, not merely legal stipulations.
 - Nuanced account of the Mosaic covenant: recognizes a **works-like substance** in its stipulations while maintaining its place within the Covenant of Grace economy.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushback against Klinean reconfigurations: Frame resists seeing the Mosaic covenant purely as a reinstatement of prelapsarian Covenant of Works or as authorizing an "intrusion ethics" that confuses prophetic-eschatological acts with normative moral law.
 - More continuity with classical Reformed readings (Westminster/Vos) than with radical covenant-reconstructionist proposals.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integration of covenant language with a broader "lordship" and perspectival method-law is read covenantally across multiple perspectives (normative, situational, existential).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read within conservative Reformed circles for providing an accessible, rhetorically pastoral yet academically robust covenantal account.
 - Influential as a corrective to some Klinean and neo-Klinean tendencies; used in seminary curricula to balance redemptive-historical sensitivity with confessional continuity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching how to hold together covenant continuity and Christocentric fulfillment; valuable as a polemical resource against certain modern covenant revisions while offering a clear pastoral application for law and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - The pre-Fall covenant with Adam framed as a principle of law-obedience under penalty; Frame affirms its reality as a theological category.
- **Covenant of Grace** - The post-Fall covenant centered in Christ; Frame emphasizes its historical administrations.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Treated as having a **works-as-to-substance** element in stipulations (site: "Mosaic Covenant Covenant Of Works As To Substance"); however, it is administered within the Covenant of Grace.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant** - Distinction between covenant substance and its various historical administrations.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam/Christ as covenantal representatives; Frame stresses legal and relational dimensions.
- **Law (moral/civil/ceremonial)** - Read covenantally; moral law as abiding, civil/ceremonial as administration-bound.
- **Lordship** - God's claim that gives covenant its normative force; central framing term for Frame's covenant theology.
- **Intrusion Ethics** - Klinean notion critiqued by Frame (see "Klinean Covenant Theology And Intrusion Ethics"); Frame argues this collapses distinct covenant roles and norms.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - Uses historical unfolding to interpret law and promises, but resists over-homologizing.
- **Continuity and discontinuity** - Key hermeneutical balance in Frame's treatment of covenants.
- **Triperspectival considerations** - Methodological tool informing covenantal interpretation (normative, situational, existential).
- **Christocentric fulfillment** - All covenant law and promise find ultimate solution in Christ's mediatorial work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed covenant categories (works/grace) with contemporary clarifications.
 - As a **polemic** against Klinean intrusion ethics and over-assertive redefinitions of the Mosaic covenant.
 - As an **exegetical-model resource** for reading Mosaic law within redemptive history while maintaining doctrinal continuity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating law, ethics, and Christ-centered soteriology in teaching and pastoral application.
