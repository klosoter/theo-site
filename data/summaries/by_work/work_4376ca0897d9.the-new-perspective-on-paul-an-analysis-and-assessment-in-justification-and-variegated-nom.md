### TITLE
**"The New Perspective on Paul: An Analysis and Assessment" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in Justification and Variegated Nomism, Vol. 2**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century response within evangelical and Reformed scholarship to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) inaugurated by E. P. Sanders and developed by James D. G. Dunn and N. T. Wright.
 - Placed in the multi-author project Justification and Variegated Nomism, a concentrated scholarly forum for debating Pauline soteriology and first-century Judaism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin argues that the NPP misconstrues Pauline categories and that a historically and theologically responsible reading upholds a forensic, declarative doctrine of justification centered on union with Christ and imputation of righteousness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical revisitations of key Pauline texts (e.g., Romans, Galatians) to test NPP claims about "works of the law" and "covenantal nomism."
 - Theological synthesis arguing that forensic/legal language in Paul coheres with a Reformed, Christocentric doctrine of justification.
 - Critique of methodological moves in NPP: overhistoricizing, neglecting canonical-theological coherence, and conflating covenantal language with an absence of forensic doctrine.
 - Emphasis on the necessity of union with Christ as the theological matrix in which justification (declaration) and sanctification (effect) are related but distinct.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (New Perspective proponents).
 - Secondary engagement with Reformation and post-Reformation theological tradition (Reformed confessions and exegetical legacy).
 - Contemporary pastoral and polemical contexts - later used against Federal Vision strains (see uses under KEY TERMS & USES).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic declaration), imputation, union with Christ, covenant (nomism vs. covenantal theology), Pauline soteriology, law and works, righteousness of God.
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers Pauline theology on a confessional, Christ-union account of justification that preserves forensic imputation and resists reducing justification to covenant-maintenance or merely ethical transformation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the forensic/declarative aspect of justification as non-negotiable and rooted in union with Christ.
 - Methodological balance: rigorous exegesis integrated with confessional theological categories rather than purely historical reconstruction.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on NPP tendencies to downplay forensic language and to read Paul primarily as addressing boundary markers in Judaism.
 - Functions as corrective to Federal Vision tendencies (see Federal Vision And Justification By Faith; Federal Vision Monocovenantalism) that conflate covenantal status, sacramental participation, and final justification.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Reasserts the analytical usefulness of terms like "imputation" and "forensic justification" against proposals that label them anachronistic.
 - Reframes "covenant" in Pauline theology as compatible with, but not substitutive of, forensic categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a robust critique of NPP and as a resource in debates with Federal Vision advocates.
 - Less influential among some NPP proponents but valued for sharpening exegetical and theological clarities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for combining thorough exegesis with confessional theology; durable classroom and polemical resource for teaching justification and critiquing revisionist readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - the cluster of proposals that reinterprets Paul in light of first-century Judaism; Gaffin critically assesses its exegetical and theological claims.
- **Forensic justification** - justification as a legal declaration of righteousness; central to Gaffin's affirmation of traditional Protestant soteriology.
- **Imputation** - the accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; defended as necessary to explain Pauline language of righteousness and standing.
- **Union with Christ** - the theological matrix for justification and sanctification; Gaffin stresses it as primary, not an alternative to forensic categories.
- **Works of the law** - interpreted against NPP readings that limit the phrase to boundary markers; Gaffin reads it broadly into a soteriological/legal framework.
- **Covenantal nomism / covenant** - NPP term for first-century Jewish religion; Gaffin critiques its use when it erases forensic dimensions in Paul.
- **Righteousness of God** - treated both as God"s saving act and as the status conferred on believers; Gaffin argues for a forensic and declarative dimension.
- **Sanctification vs. justification** - maintained as distinct but related in union with Christ; Gaffin resists conflations that collapse declarative standing into ethical change.
- **Monocovenantalism (Federal Vision Monocovenantalism)** - Federal Vision emphasis that blurs covenantal status and final justification; Gaffin's analysis is used to rebut its implications.
- **Federal Vision And Justification By Faith** - a locus where Gaffin's work is invoked to defend justification by faith alone against sacramental/covenantal readings that locate final justification in covenantal participation.
- **Exegetical method** - close reading of Pauline texts integrated with theological categories; presented as corrective to both historicist and purely sociological approaches.
- **Theological coherence** - insistence that biblical exegesis must cohere with confessional doctrines like imputation and forensic acquittal.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an exegetical-model and theological defense of classical Reformed views on justification (teaching and seminary lectures).
- As a polemical and clarifying resource against Federal Vision And Justification By Faith and Federal Vision Monocovenantalism, mobilized to defend justification by faith alone.
- As a definition source for contemporary Reformed articulations of imputation, forensic declaration, and union with Christ.
