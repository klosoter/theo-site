### TITLE
Contributions to The British and Foreign Evangelical Review (on church polity) - James Bannerman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-19th century British evangelical and Free Church milieu; post-Disruption Scottish debates about church-state relations, ecclesiastical constitution, and the nature of Presbyterian order. The Review functioned as a forum for evangelical, Reformed scrutiny of polity and practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** defense and clarification of **Presbyterian polity** as the biblically warranted, historically continuous, and theologically coherent form of church government, particularly against Erastian state control and sectarian voluntarism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical claim: New Testament data implies an ordered plurality of elders (presbyters) with functions of teaching, ruling and administering sacraments.
 - Historical claim: Continuity from apostolic practice through Reformation precedents (especially Scottish) supports presbyterial courts rather than episcopal or purely congregational models.
 - Constitutional claim: Distinction between the church's spiritual jurisdiction and the civil magistrate; the church must possess independent spiritual courts (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly) to exercise discipline and ordination.
 - Practical claim: Properly understood offices (minister vs. ruling elder) and regulated discipline preserve congregational faithfulness without sliding into clericalism or voluntarist sectarianism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** frequent appeal to Scripture (New Testament letters), Reformation authorities (Calvin, Knox), Scottish Free Church leaders (implicitly and explicitly), critics including Erastians, moderate Anglicans and Congregationalists; use of Westminster standards as a hermeneutical-locus classicus.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (nature, marks, and government of the church), covenant and visible church membership, authority and keys, ministry and ordination, discipline, and the relation of church and state.
- **Closing line:** Bannerman situates Presbyterian polity as a theologically grounded, scripturally defensible, and pastorally necessary structure that secures ordered worship, church discipline, and the church's spiritual independence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear distinction between divine institution and ecclesiastical arrangement: Bannerman treats Presbyterian courts as divinely warranted insofar as Scripture ordains plurality and mutual oversight, while allowing careful historical nuance about form and development.
 - Stress on the parity and complementary roles of teaching and ruling elders; warding off both clerical monopoly and anarchic congregationalism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Erastian tendencies by insisting on the church's exclusive spiritual jurisdiction and right to discipline its members.
 - Pushes back on voluntarist/congregational claims that minimize corporate oversight and deny courts above the local session.
 - Distinguishes his position from high-church episcopacy by denying a monarchical episcopate and emphasizing court plurality and mutual accountability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of "office" vs "function": treating ordination as a durable office with distinct responsibilities rather than merely a temporary function.
 - A robust articulation of "parity" that preserves ministerial distinctiveness while denying hierarchical episcopal supremacy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within Free Church and broader Scottish Presbyterian circles as argumentative resourceation against state interference and for internal constitutional clarity.
 - Cited later in debates over confessional polity, church courts, and ecumenical negotiations where Presbyterian identity required defense.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of combining exegesis, historical theology, and constitutional argument; useful for teaching ecclesiology, ecclesial polity, and church-state questions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterian polity:** Church government by a graded system of courts (session, presbytery, synod, assembly) based on the rule of elders.
- **Elder / presbyter:** Plural office including teaching (minister) and ruling elders; shared governance and oversight.
 - **Teaching elder (minister):** Primary responsibility for preaching, sacraments, and pastoral instruction.
 - **Ruling elder:** Lay office with governing and disciplinary duties alongside ministers.
- **Parity:** Doctrinal claim that ministers and elders share in the same presbyterial status while differing in function.
- **Church courts:** Institutionalized forums for governance and discipline (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly).
- **Discipline:** The church's spiritual jurisdiction to admonish, exclude, and restore members; a mark of faithful ecclesial order.
- **Ordination:** Public, ecclesial act instituting persons into the office of ministry and elder with lasting authority.
- **Spiritual independence:** The principle that the church bears a distinct spiritual jurisdiction not subject to civil magistrate control.
- **Erastianism:** The theory that the state holds authority over the church; Bannerman argues against this intrusion.
- **Voluntaryism:** The view that churches are voluntary associations with minimal supra-local governance; criticized as undermining biblical oversight.
- **Office vs. function:** Distinction affirming durable offices (with solemn ordination) over merely temporary or functional tasks.
- **Call:** The corporate and divine summons to ministry; involves congregation, presbytery, and ordaining acts.
- **Keys / jurisdiction:** The church's authority to bind and loose in spiritual matters, exercised through discipline and sacraments.
- **Covenant theology (ecclesial implications):** Underpins visible/invisible church distinctions and membership responsibilities that make discipline intelligible.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Presbyterian categories (parity, courts, eldership).
 - As a **polemic** against Erastian and voluntarist positions in church-state and congregational debates.
 - As an **exegetical-constitutional model** for applying New Testament practices to corporate church ordering and discipline.
