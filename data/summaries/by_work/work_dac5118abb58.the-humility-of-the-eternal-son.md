### TITLE
The Humility of the Eternal Son - Bruce McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed/evangelical scholarly debate (late 20th-early 21st c.). Engages renewed interest in kenosis and Trinitarian theology shaped by Barth, Thomas F. Torrance, and recent historical-theological readings of Calvin and Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** McCormack contends that the Son's humility (kenosis) must be understood as an **eternal, Trinitarian, and relational mode of the Son's personhood** rather than as an ontological loss of divine attributes in the incarnation. He aims to reconcile genuine self-emptying language with orthodox commitments to divine immutability and the full divinity of the Son.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical and doctrinal press of kenosis language (Philippians 2 and patristic/ Reformational texts).
 - Historical reading of the Reformed tradition (esp. Calvin, Owen, selected orthodox sources) to show resources for a non-ontological kenosis.
 - Constructive proposal: the Son's humility is rooted in **eternal relationality** (eternal generation and receptivity) that culminates in the incarnation without metaphysical loss.
 - Polemic against classical ontological kenoticisms that posit alteration or subtraction of divine attributes; also a corrective to rigid impassibility models that render God aloof.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Philippians 2 (primary Pauline locus); Augustine and Athanasius (patristic backgrounds); John Calvin, John Owen, Reformed orthodoxy; Karl Barth and Thomas F. Torrance (modern constructive allies); contemporary kenotic theologians and critics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (immanent vs. economic), Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, kenosis), divine attributes (immutability, impassibility), soteriology implicitly (humiliation and exaltation).
- **Closing line:** The book reframes kenosis as **eternal Trinitarian humility** - a pattern of personal self-giving intrinsic to the Son that grounds incarnation and preserves divine simplicity and immutability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **eternality** of the Son's humility: not merely a moment in history but grounded in the Son's eternal relations within the Trinity.
 - Frames kenosis primarily as **relational self-limitation** (receptivity to the Father) rather than as ontological deprivation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects classical ontological kenoticism (which claims divine attributes are relinquished) as incompatible with orthodox Trinitarianism.
 - Offers a middle path between brutal impassibility (God as unresponsive) and radical kenoticism (God as changeable), critiquing both.
 - Revises common readings of Reformed authors to show they can support a robust kenotic sensibility without capitulating to ontological alteration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses categories like "eternal humility" and "relational kenosis" to mark a shift from event-centered to person-centered kenotic language.
 - Emphasizes **receiving** as an ontological category for the Son - receptive relation to the Father as constitutive rather than defeasible.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among contemporary Reformed scholars seeking a Trinitarian account that preserves both divine immutability and genuine self-giving.
 - Cited in debates on Philippians 2, in discussions of Torrance-inspired relational theology, and in critical responses from both classical kenoticists and strict defenders of divine impassibility.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a careful hermeneutic and historical-theological model for integrating kenosis with orthodoxy.
 - Serves as a clarifying corrective in Christological and Trinitarian teaching and a resource for theological retrieval within the Reformed tradition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Humility of the Eternal Son:** The central term - the Son's intrinsic, relational mode of self-giving grounded in eternal Trinitarian relations.
- **Kenosis:** Self-emptying; McCormack treats it as relational/hypostatic rather than ontological subtraction.
 - Contrast: **Ontological kenosis** (rejected) vs **relational kenosis** (endorsed).
- **Relational self-limitation:** The Son's receptive posture toward the Father as constitutive of his personhood.
- **Eternal generation:** The doctrine deployed to explain how the Son's humility is eternal and not merely incarnational.
- **Hypostatic union:** The junction in which the Son's eternal humility is realized historically without loss of divinity.
- **Divine immutability:** Affirmed and reinterpreted to allow for relational dynamics without metaphysical change.
- **Impassibility:** Critiqued in its rigid forms; McCormack argues for a Trinitarian impassibility that allows for genuine relational responsiveness.
- **Economic vs. immanent Trinity:** Used to distinguish events in salvation history from the eternal personal relations that ground them.
- **Self-emptying (ekkenosis):** The Philippians 2 motif reclaimed as consistent with eternal Trinitarian humility.
- **Reception (receptivity):** A key ontological category for the Son - receiving the divine will and mission without diminution.
- **Reformed retrieval:** The methodological use of Calvin, Owen, and orthodox sources to ground the proposal.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed-compatible kenotic language (useful in Christology and Trinity loci).
- As a **polemic** against ontological kenoticisms and against depersonalizing impassibility.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 within Trinitarian theology and for connecting incarnation to eternal Sonship.
