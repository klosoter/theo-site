### TITLE
George M. Marsden, "Jonathan Edwards: A Life" 
Publisher/date: (standard bibliographic details as in library holdings) 
Subject: Intellectual and pastoral biography of Jonathan Edwards (1703-1758) with sustained theological interpretation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century revival of interest in American religious history; places Edwards in the intersections of New England Puritanism, the Great Awakening, and Enlightenment intellectual currents.
 - Marsden writes as a historian-theologian, using archival sources to correct earlier popular and polemical portraits.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Edwards is presented as a coherent thinker who holds classical Reformed commitments (including **total depravity/total inability**) while engaging Enlightenment epistemology and revivalist pastoral practice; his theology makes sovereignty of God and the psychological dynamics of conversion mutually explanatory.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Intellectual biography: shows development from youthful scholasticism to mature synthesis.
 - Pastoral biography: situates sermons, revival involvement, and congregational conflicts as formative for theological emphases.
 - Theological synthesis: traces how Edwards locates human inability in the affections and wills, and how divine grace operates to renew affections toward God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Edwards' sermons, treatises (e.g., Freedom of the Will, Religious Affections), notebooks.
 - Interlocutors: Solomon Stoddard (influence and contrast), Old Light vs. New Light controversies, Enlightenment writers and natural philosophers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Total depravity and total inability**, original sin, freedom and compatibilism, affections, revival/theology of conversion, providence, covenant, atonement, natural theology.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Marsden casts Edwards as a theologian who insists that human sin is pervasive and ineradicable except by sovereign, transforming grace that reorders affections-and who frames that claim within both rigorous metaphysical argument and urgent pastoral care.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses Edwards' psychological realism: sin as primarily an affections-and-will problem, not merely intellectual error.
 - Presents Edwards as a reconciler of Calvinist orthodoxy and Enlightenment reason, not as an anti-rational fanatic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that reduce Edwards to revivalist excess or cold metaphysical determinism; shows continuity between his pastoral aims and systematic arguments (e.g., Freedom of the Will grounded in pastoral observation).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Highlights Edwards' concept of "disinterested benevolence" as key to understanding both sanctification and critique of self-interested piety.
 - Frames "total inability" in terms of moral inability (lack of right affections) rather than merely cognitive impotence.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major catalyst for modern Edwards studies; widely used in American religious history, theology, and church contexts to rehabilitate Edwards' reputation.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments that emphasize Edwards' pastoral motives and subtle theology of affections.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a richly sourced model for integrating biography, intellectual history, and doctrinal exegesis; valuable for students studying how doctrines like total depravity function in pastoral theology and revival movements.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total depravity**
 - Marsden shows Edwards articulating human sin as pervasive in will and affections; not merely external transgression but inward corruption.
- **Total inability**
 - Interpreted as moral inability to choose God without sovereign grace; Edwards locates inability in the heart's disordered loves.
- **Original sin**
 - Treated historically and pastorally; Marsden emphasizes Edwards' inherited Puritan categories refracted through empirical pastoral observation.
- **Freedom of the Will / compatibilism**
 - Edwards' account of liberty as compatible with divine causation is presented as central to reconciling human responsibility and divine sovereignty.
- **Affections**
 - The pivot of Edwards' anthropology; conversion is reordering of affections so that God becomes the supreme end.
- **Disinterested benevolence**
 - Moral ideal where love of God is not self-seeking; Marsden shows its role in Edwards' ethics and critique of hypocritical piety.
- **Revival / Great Awakening**
 - Context for many theological developments; Marsden treats revivals as both empirical events and theological catalysts.
- **Providence**
 - Edwards' view of meticulous divine governance is connected to his pastoral assurance and doctrine of conversion.
- **Covenant**
 - Used to explain corporate and generational aspects of sin and grace in New England theology.
- **Atonement**
 - Subsumed under Edwards' systematic theology of redemption-objective satisfaction and subjective renovation of affections.
- **Natural theology**
 - Edwards engages reason and observation to argue for God's existence and attributes, without undermining dependence on revelation.
- **Moral inability vs. physical inability**
 - Marsden emphasizes Edwards' distinction: inability is moral (inclination), not mere physical incapacity.
- **Use across loci**
 - As doctrinal source: authoritative treatment of Edwards on **total depravity/total inability** for systematic theology.
 - As exegetical/pastoral model: shows how theological formulations arise from pastoral contexts (revival, pulpit, pastoral care).
 - As historiographical polemic: employed to counter both hagiographic and reductionist accounts of Edwards, serving as a conceptual pivot for modern Edwards scholarship.
