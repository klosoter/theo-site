### TITLE
"Response to Vos," in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation, ed. D. A. Carson. Author: Richard B. Gaffin Jr. 
Publication context: conservative Reformed contribution to the late-20th-century revival of redemptive-historical and canonical approaches to Scripture; dialogue with Geerhardus Vos and subsequent Vosian interpreters.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th century Reformed theological renewal that sought to recover biblical-theological, covenantal, and Christ-centered reading of Scripture against perceived pietistic/subjectivist and purely dogmatic approaches.
 - Engages the Vosian legacy as reframed by recent scholars who separate descriptive biblical theology from prescriptive systematic theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin defends a *linked but not identical* relation between biblical theology and systematic theology: biblical theology rightly describes the historical, progressive self-revelation of God in redemptive history, but that description is intrinsically theological and normative when read canonically in Christ.
 - Primary problem: how to maintain both historical-horizon sensitivity and theological normativity without collapsing one into the other.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies Vos's original intentions and the appropriate scope of a Vosian method.
 - Argues against a strict bifurcation that reduces biblical theology to mere history and thereby evacuates its doctrinal force.
 - Emphasizes the canonical, Christocentric culmination of redemptive history as the point where historical sequence becomes theological content (apostolic and canonical interpretation effect normative doctrine).
 - Insists on the Spirit-wrought apostolic reading and the unity of Scripture as warrant for moving from historical description to confessional/doctrinal formulation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Geerhardus Vos (and subsequent interpreters who sharpened the history/systematics divide).
 - Uses canonical and apostolic testimony (NT fulfillment motifs), Reformed doctrinal tradition (covenant theology), and methodological reflection on historiography and theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (progressive, redemptive-historical)
 - Biblical theology vs. systematic theology (method and relation)
 - Christology (centrality of Christ as interpretive key)
 - Covenant and eschatology (inaugurated fulfillment)
 - Authority and normativity of the canon and apostolic interpretation
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin locates the theological center of gravity in the canon's redemptive-historical progress that culminates in Christ, thereby making biblical theology both historically disciplined and theologically normative for systematic formulation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that biblical theology, rightly done, is inherently theological because it narrates God's saving acts that culminate in Christ and the apostolic proclamation.
 - Stress on the apostolic/ canonical mediation as the moment descriptive history becomes normative theology.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects readings of Vos that treat biblical theology as a purely descriptive auxiliary to systematics; resists a rigid compartmentalization.
 - Argues against both reductionist historicism (that severs doctrine from history) and ahistorical dogmatism (that abstracts doctrine from redemptive-historical development).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines the language of "culmination" and "canonical reading" to mark where historical sequence gains doctrinal force.
 - Articulates a Reformed model where redemptive-historical description and confessional theology are mutually informing.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed seminaries and among proponents of redemptive-historical preaching and exegesis.
 - Influential corrective in debates over the proper relation of exegesis to dogmatics; cited in curricula on biblical theology and hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined method for integrating exegetical history-of-revelation work with doctrinal theology.
 - Serves as a compact model for keeping Christ at the center of hermeneutics while preserving historical fidelity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - The discipline that traces the progressive, historical revelation of God in Scripture; for Gaffin, inherently theological when read canonically.
- **Systematic theology**
 - The theological task of formulating doctrinal truth; distinct in method but dependent on biblical theology for content and normative grounding.
- **Vosian distinction**
 - The classic distinction between descriptive biblical theology and prescriptive systematic theology; Gaffin preserves the distinction but rejects a strict separation.
- **Redemptive history (heilsgeschichte)**
 - The unfolding of God's saving acts across time; the primary data of biblical theology.
- **Canonical reading / termination**
 - The procedural move whereby historical sequences are interpreted and given theological import in the canon, especially in the NT fulfillment.
- **Christocentrism**
 - The principle that Christ is the interpretive key and climax of redemptive history.
- **Apostolic hermeneutic**
 - The Spirit-enabled interpretive practice of the apostles that reads OT events as fulfilled and doctrinally decisive in Christ.
- **Normativity**
 - The claim that canonical, Christ-centered biblical theology generates doctrinal norms for the church and systematics.
- **Fulfillment / typology**
 - The theological mechanism (type/antitype, promise/fulfillment) by which earlier revelation acquires its full meaning in Christ.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The "already/not-yet" framework that Gaffin employs to mediate historical fulfilment and future consummation.
- **Covenant**
 - The structuring motif of redemptive history for Gaffin; integrates particular-redemptive acts into covenantal promises and fulfillment.
- **Scriptural self-interpretation**
 - The idea that Scripture, especially by apostolic reading, supplies the decisive theological interpretation of its own history.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for a nuanced Vosian model that resists rigid compartmentalization of biblical theology and systematics.
- As a **polemic** against historical reductionism and against ahistorical dogmatism in Reformed circles.
- As an **exegetical-canonical model** for preaching and teaching that aims to move from OT narrative to NT theological claim in a Christ-centered manner.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary curricula to integrate doctrinal formulation with redemptive-historical exegesis.
