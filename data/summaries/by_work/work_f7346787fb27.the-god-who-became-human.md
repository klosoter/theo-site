### TITLE
The God Who Became Human - Graham A. Cole

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed theological environment; engages biblical-theological method and historical dogma to address modern christological controversies.
 - Written for pastors, students, and scholars seeking a careful, conservative account of the incarnation grounded in Scripture and tradition.

- **Central thesis**
 - The incarnation is the decisive self-revelation of the triune God: the eternal Word personally assumed true human nature without ceasing to be God, thereby uniting divine and human realities in one person for the purposes of redemption, revelation, and mediation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: traces OT anticipations (theophanies, promises) and NT fulfillment (Gospels, Pauline and Johannine Christology) to show biblical warrant for God's personal entrance into human history.
 - Historical retrieval: reconstructs patristic and Chalcedonian formulations to show how classical doctrine preserves biblical insights while avoiding ancient and modern errors.
 - Systematic synthesis: articulates the hypostatic union, the communication of properties, the ongoing humanity of Christ, and the implications for atonement, resurrection, and worship.
 - Polemical moves: critiques kenoticism, functionalist reductions, dehistoricized spirituality, and liberal readings that domesticate or disincarnate Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on patristic authors (Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedonian schema, Reformation (esp. Calvinic emphases), and contemporary theologians across conservative and constructive streams.
 - Engages modern critics of classical christology - proponents of kenosis and those emphasizing mere moral influence or purely functional messianisms.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures), Trinity (personal relations and mission), revelation (God's self-disclosure in Christ), soteriology (atonement and mediation), resurrection and exaltation, and pastoral/worship implications.

- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on the claim that God's becoming human is the ontological and salvific hinge of Christian theology: one divine Person truly and permanently assumed human nature to mediate salvation and disclose God to us.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A sustained biblical-theological movement from OT theophanies to NT embodiment, showing continuity rather than rupture in God's self-revelation.
 - Strong insistence that incarnation is ontological (what God did) not merely functional (what God accomplished).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to kenotic and reductionist christologies that subordinate deity or reduce incarnation to exemplary action.
 - Challenges readings that privatize the incarnation as primarily symbolic or non-historical.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful deployment of classical terms (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum) but with renewed attention to biblical categories of covenant presence and divine agency.
 - Emphasizes relational and redemptive language (mediator, covenant head, divine presence) to bridge dogma and pastoral concerns.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a clear, conservative resource on incarnation and Christology.
 - Praised for integrating exegesis, history, and systematics; used as a corrective text against contemporary drift in christological doctrine.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, balanced synthesis that models how to read Scripture and tradition together; useful for teaching, sermon preparation, and defending orthodox Christology in contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation**
 - God the Son assuming true human nature; central event of revelation and redemption.

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - One person (the Word) with two distinct, unconfused natures - fully God and fully human.

- **Two Natures**
 - Divine nature (unchangeable, omnipotent) and human nature (finite, passible) united in one person.

- **Communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties)**
 - Theological principle explaining how attributes of deity and humanity can be ascribed to the single person of Christ.

- **Kenosis**
 - Theories that the Son emptied divine attributes; treated critically as insufficient or speculative.

- **Theophany / Divine accommodation**
 - OT manifestations of God that anticipate the fuller self-revelation in the incarnate Word.

- **Mediatorship**
 - Christ as the sole mediator who unites God and humanity personally and ontologically.

- **Atonement (soteriological implications)**
 - Incarnation as prerequisite for substitutionary and representational aspects of atonement; grounds for Christ's efficacy.

- **Resurrection and Exaltation**
 - Confirmation and vindication of the incarnate work; basis for Christ's present mediatorial rule.

- **Revelation**
 - Christ as the decisive disclosure of God's character and will; hermeneutical key for Scripture.

- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Classical attributes preserved but reinterpreted in light of the Son's real suffering and death in the economy.

- **Perichoresis / Trinitarian relations**
 - Background framework for understanding divine personhood and mission in incarnation.

- **Ongoing humanity of Christ**
 - Affirmation that Christ retains genuine human nature after exaltation, relevant for sacraments and priesthood.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a *definition source* for orthodox incarnation and hypostatic union in systematic theology courses.
- As a *polemic* resource against kenotic, liberal, or overly functional christologies.
- As an *exegetical model* linking OT theophanies and NT Christology for biblical theology seminars.
- As a *conceptual pivot* in preaching and pastoral teaching on mediation, atonement, and worship.
