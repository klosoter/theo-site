### TITLE
**Rahner and Barth on the Trinity** (Dialog, 1966) - Robert Jenson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 1960s post-war theological conversation; Dialog journal as ecumenical forum. Jenson writes at the height of renewed interest in Trinitarian theology shaped by Karl Rahner's transcendental-theological program and Karl Barth's neo-orthodox, christocentric revival. The piece addresses debates about method and the relation of revelation to doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How are the **economic Trinity** (God as revealed and acting in history) and the **immanent Trinity** (God as God in himself) to be related? Jenson reads Rahner's asserted identity-rule (the economic is the immanent) against Barth's reformulation that preserves a distinction grounded in revelation-event. He asks whether either move secures Christian claims about God without collapsing God into human categories or privatizing revelation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of **Rahner's Rule**: Rahner's method makes the economic revelation determinative for claims about the immanent life of God, using a transcendental-anthropological access to make the move from human knowledge to divine being.
 - Exposition of **Barth's reformulation**: Barth accepts that revelation is primary but insists on a dialectical distinction-God remains other; immanent life cannot be conjectured apart from the concrete revelatory event (Christ).
 - Comparative critique: Jenson probes the epistemic and theological consequences of each-Rahner risks reducing the divine mystery to the a priori structures of human knowing; Barth risks an asymmetry that makes immanent triune life invisible save as a postulated consequence of the revelation-event.
 - Synthetic suggestion: Jenson gestures toward a mediating posture that honors the revelatory primacy while insisting that revelation legitimately authorizes statements about God's immanent life, without collapsing otherness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Karl Rahner (principal proponent of the Rule), Karl Barth (critic and reformulator), modern Trinitarian retrieval in mid-20th-century theological method; Jenson interprets texts from both and engages the broader analytic tensions in contemporary dogmatics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (economic vs immanent), revelation, christology (revelation in the person and work of Christ), theological method (transcendental vs dialectical), ecclesial confession.
- **Closing line:** The piece centers on whether and how the Jesus-event authorizes trustworthy claims about the eternal triune life-Jenson probes Rahner and Barth to show that the Trinitarian confession requires both revelatory primacy and a disciplined, nonreductive move from event to God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Reads the Rahner-Barth dispute as primarily epistemic: not merely metaphysics of God but rules for legitimate theological inference from revelation to doctrine.
 - Treats Rahner's move as a methodological rule rather than a simple ontological claim, and Barth's as a reformulation that secures divine otherness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Nuances common polemical readings by showing weaknesses in both one-sided positions: Rahner's risk of anthropocentrism and Barth's risk of an inaccessible immanent Trinity.
 - Insists that neither abandonment of immanent talk nor careless identification of economic with immanent is theologically satisfactory.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Frames the debate in terms of "rule" and "reformulation," highlighting procedural moves in theology (how one justifies moving from revelation to ontological claims).
 - Emphasizes the juridical/epistemic character of trinitarian doxology-doctrine is a disciplined claim about God's life, not mere speculative metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Read as an early Jenson intervention that prefigures his later sustained trinitarian constructive work; influential among students seeking a middle path between Barthian christocentrism and Rahnerian transcendentalism.
 - Cited in later debates on methodological legitimacy in Trinitarian theology and ecumenical discussions about doctrine formation.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Valuable as a compact model of comparative theological method: careful textual attention, categorical clarity, and a constructive impulse to preserve both revelation's primacy and legitimate doctrinal inference.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule:** The methodological principle that the economic Trinity (God revealed in history) is decisive for claims about the immanent Trinity; Jenson treats it as an epistemic rule with anthropological presuppositions.
- **Barth's reformulation:** Barth's insistence on revelation-event as determinate while maintaining a dialectical distinction between economic and immanent Trinity.
- **Economic Trinity:** God as acting and revealed in history (the object of christological and soteriological confession).
- **Immanent Trinity:** God as God in himself, the internal relations of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
- **Economic-immanent relation:** The theological move or rule that relates historical revelation to doctrine about divine being.
- **Transcendental method:** Rahner's appeal to structures of human knowing as warrant for theological claims about God's immanent life.
- **Dialectical method:** Barth's theological modality stressing God's otherness and revelation as event rather than projection.
- **Revelation-event (Christ-event):** The concrete historical disclosure in Jesus Christ that grounds theological knowledge.
- **Analogy and analogy-of-being:** Underlying debates about language for God; Jenson highlights the need for disciplined analogical moves.
- **Theological grammar:** Jenson's concern for the rules and moves that make trinitarian speech responsible.
- **Epistemic warrant:** The conditions under which claims about God's inner life may be made.
- **Perichoresis (implicit):** The relational language at stake when describing immanent triune life; its use must be checked by method.
- **Confessional priority:** The claim that Christian confession (Christ-event) governs doctrinal inference.
- **Nonreductive inference:** Jenson's desideratum: move from revelation to immanent statement without collapsing otherness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Rahner's Rule and Barth's contrasting move-concise, methodological framing.
- As a **polemic/mediating resource** in debates between transcendental and dialectical approaches to Trinitarian theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading theological method (how to justify inferential steps from revelation to doctrine).
