### TITLE
History and the Triune God - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the postwar West German theological renewal (published 1969 English translation 1975); shaped by political theology, existential angst of history, and the influence of Karl Barth, Ernst Bloch, and liberation themes.
 - Positioned within constructive Protestant theology; engages patristic, medieval, and modern sources to reconceive Trinity for historical thought.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God is not a timeless solitary being but a triune God whose intra-divine life is intrinsically historical and eschatological; history is the arena of God's being and revelation rather than merely an object of divine action.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - The Trinity must be read historically: the Father, Son, and Spirit disclose themselves in the unfolding of creation, covenant, and eschaton.
 - Moves from critique of timeless ontology to a relational, dynamic, and economical ontology of God.
 - Critique of abstractions that sever God from history.
 - Reappropriation of patristic social/relational language to insist on divine mutuality and historical kenosis.
 - Integration of covenantal and typological readings of Scripture to show God's triune self-revelation across redemptive history.
 - Places the Spirit as the agent who actualizes the future in the present - the promise and power of eschatological reconciliation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Karl Barth (reformulation of revelation), Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), Augustine and Gregory of Nazianzus (patristic trinitarianism), Athanasius, Calvinic covenantal themes, Van Til (critique of "one-person" language), and contemporary debates on eternal generation and spiration.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Doctrine of the Trinity**, covenant theology, Christology (incarnation and kenosis), pneumatology (Spirit as promise and future), theology of history, typology and fulfillment, revelation, and eschatology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Moltmann reframes Trinitarian doctrine as the theological key to a historicized, eschatological God whose inner life is the source and promise of history's liberation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that divine life is intrinsically historical and future-oriented; God as promise (Zukunft) rather than static timeless substance.
 - Prioritizes the economic Trinity to illumine the immanent Trinity without collapsing the distinction.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects abstractions of classical metaphysical theology (timelessness, aseity construed as isolation) and challenges readings that make God indifferent to temporal history.
 - Contrasts with Rahner's transcendental Christology by emphasizing history and eschatological promise over purely epistemic grounds for knowing God.
 - Critiques Van Til's one-person language for underplaying genuine divine plurality and relationality.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts typology and fulfillment within a trinitarian-historical framework: types as signs within the triune economy.
 - Develops a relational-ontological vocabulary (mutuality, kenosis, promise) linking Trinity and history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary constructive and political theologies; provoked renewed interest in social/relational Trinitarian models.
 - Stimulated dialogue around eternal generation, spiration, and debates on eternal functional subordination by foregrounding the economic as normative for immanent talk.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating eschatology, ethics, and doctrine; valuable for covenant theologians reassessing typology and for pneumatology that centers the Spirit as the future-making God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Triune God as historical / eschatological**
 - God's being unfolds in time; history is the locus of divine self-disclosure and fulfillment.
- **Economic vs. ontological Trinity**
 - Prioritizes economic revelation to inform immanent doctrine while resisting reductionism.
- **Promise (Zukunft)**
 - The Spirit as the bearer of God's future into present; eschatology central to divine action.
- **Kenosis**
 - Emphasis on self-giving and vulnerability in the Son and within intra-trinitarian relations.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Reads covenantal structures typologically within trinitarian history - promise, fulfillment, and faithfulness as triune acts.
- **Typology and fulfillment**
 - Biblical types are temporal signs oriented toward the triune fulfillment in Christ and the Spirit.
- **Person and deity of the Holy Spirit**
 - Spirit as personal, divine agent who brings future reality and unifies covenant people.
- **Eternal Generation and Spiration**
 - Engages doctrine to defend relationality without collapsing the economic into immanent categories.
- **Rahner's Rule and Barth's reformulation**
 - Uses Barthian corrective to Rahner: revelation in history is decisive for immanent language; critiques purely transcendental moves.
- **Van Til's one-person language critique**
 - Opposes monadic language about God that erases intra-divine plurality; advocates genuinely tri-personal speech.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination debates**
 - Moltmann's relational emphasis has been appropriated or contested in debates about roles and subordination within the Godhead.
- **Relational ontology / social Trinity**
 - Theology of persons-in-relations; influences social readings of personhood and community.
- **Theology of history**
 - History is the theatre of divine self-revelation and judgement; theology must be historicizing.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for a historicized, eschatological Trinity.
 - As a **polemic** against timeless substance metaphysics and one-person language.
 - As an **exegetical model** for typology, covenant, and pneumatology grounded in triune action.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on eternal generation, spiration, and functional relations in the Godhead.
