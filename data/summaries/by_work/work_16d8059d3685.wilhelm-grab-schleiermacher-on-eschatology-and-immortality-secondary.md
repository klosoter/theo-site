### TITLE
Wilhelm Gräb - "Schleiermacher on Eschatology and Immortality" (secondary study of Friedrich Schleiermacher). 
Focus: Schleiermacher's reframing of eschatology and human immortality within religious consciousness and communal life (topic: Eschatological Anthropology).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Schleiermacher writes in the turn-of-the-19th-century German theological and philosophical milieu (post-Kantian, Romantic, reaction to Enlightenment rationalism and Pietism).
 - Gräb writes as a modern scholarly interpreter, situating Schleiermacher within later liberal Protestant debates and contemporary theological anthropology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Schleiermacher reconceives eschatology and immortality away from speculative metaphysics toward the structure of religious self-consciousness and ecclesial hope; Gräb argues this yields an eschatological anthropology centered on relational continuity in God rather than mere soul-survival.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Traditional proofs for individual, metaphysical immortality are philosophically and theologically unstable in modernity.
 - Ressource: Schleiermacher grounds hope in the "feeling of absolute dependence" and the community of faith - eschatological expectation is a spiritual-psychological reality with ethical and communal consequences.
 - Reconstruction: Immortality is primarily understood as participation in the divine life (continuity of personality insofar as it is redeemed in community), and resurrection language is reinterpreted functionally as restoration of moral-personal wholeness within the covenantal people.
 - Implications: Eschatology becomes a present-tense dynamic (the "eternal in the present"), informing ethics, ecclesiology, and the Christian understanding of death and destiny.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Schleiermacher interacts with Kantian critical philosophy, Romantic anthropology, Hegelian systematics, Pietist piety, and traditional Protestant dogmatics.
 - Gräb dialogues with subsequent interpreters in liberal and conservative traditions to test Schleiermacher's coherence and applicability.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, anthropology, immortality, resurrection, soteriology (union with God), ecclesiology (community as locus of eschatological reality), and implicitly Christology (Christ as exemplar/mediator of the renewed life).
- **Closing line**
 - Gräb reads Schleiermacher as displacing metaphysical immortality with a pastoral-theological eschatology: human destiny is shaped by faithful participation in the abiding life of God as realized in communal religious consciousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Priority of religious feeling ("absolute dependence") as the ground for eschatological hope rather than speculative proofs or dogmatic assertions.
 - Eschatology conceived primarily as communal and ethical continuity rather than individual metaphysical survival.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Cartesian/dualistic and Thomistic/metaphysical accounts of a detachable immortal soul.
 - Differs from Hegelian totalizing system by staying pastoral and existential rather than subsuming eschatology into philosophical absolute.
 - Moves beyond Pietist consolation; integrates existential urgency with theological responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Eternal in the present" - eschatological actuality experienced in present piety and communal life.
 - Immortality as "participatory continuity" - continuity defined by relation to God and community, not by ontological separability.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped liberal Protestant approaches to death, hope, and the afterlife in the 19th-20th centuries.
 - Provoked conservative critique for allegedly diminishing objective resurrection and personal survival.
 - Renewed interest in contemporary theological anthropology and pastoral theology for resources on meaning and survival without metaphysical proofs.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating existential human needs with doctrinal reflection; useful in pastoral contexts and in critically rethinking classical categories of personhood and life after death.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence**
 - The foundational religious feeling that grounds all theological claims, including hope in the future.
- **Religious self-consciousness**
 - The reflective awareness that makes eschatological hope intelligible and ethically formative.
- **Eschatological hope**
 - A present-oriented expectation shaped by faith-community practices and promises.
- **Immortality (participatory continuity)**
 - Continuity of personhood insofar as it is realized and preserved in relation to God and the redeemed community.
- **Resurrection (functional/ethical)**
 - Not merely biological resuscitation, but restoration of moral-personal wholeness within communal life.
- **Eternal in the present**
 - The idea that eschatological reality is accessible now through religious experience and practice.
- **Community of the redeemed**
 - The locus in which immortality and eschatological identity are actualized.
- **Metaphysical survival**
 - Classical doctrine of the soul's independent persistence - Schleiermacher/Gräb critique this as philosophically tenuous.
- **Ontological continuity**
 - A neutral term to describe what is preserved in death: identity preserved through relation to God, not substance.
- **Historical eschatology**
 - The placing of eschatological fulfillment within the ongoing life of the church and history.
- **Ethical consequence**
 - How eschatological convictions reshape moral behavior in the present.
- **Pastoral emphasis**
 - The pragmatic concern for how doctrines of death and destiny comfort and form communities.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definition source for a relational, non-dualistic **eschatological anthropology**.
 - As a polemic tool against metaphysical proofs for personal immortality in modern theology.
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for reading resurrection language as communal restoration and present-transforming hope.
