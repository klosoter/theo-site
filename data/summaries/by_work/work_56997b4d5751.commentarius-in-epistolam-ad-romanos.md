### TITLE
Commentarius in Epistolam ad Romanos - Francis Turretin (François Turrettini), 17th-century Reformed scholastic commentary on Romans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written mid‑17th century within the Reformed scholastic milieu of Geneva; Turretin is responding to post‑Reformation controversies (Arminianism, Socinianism, Roman Catholic scholasticism) and to practical pastoral concerns in a confessional Geneva shaped by the Synodical and Westminster debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Exegetical defense and systematic exposition of Paul's doctrine of justification, imputation, union with Christ, and the place of the law in Christian life - establishing Romans as the cornerstone for orthodox Reformed soteriology and federal covenant theology.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Verse‑by‑verse exegetical commentary grounded in classical philology and scholastic disputation.
 - Repeated movement: (1) textual exegesis, (2) doctrinal axiom (e.g., justification, election), (3) polemical rebuttal (Arminians, Socinians, Papists), (4) pastoral application.
 - Major moves: justification by faith alone (forensic imputation), double imputation (sin to Christ, righteousness to believer), the role of the Mosaic law vis‑a‑vis the covenant of grace, and ethical consequences for believers (sanctification, obedience, eschatological readiness).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary), Augustine and Calvin (authoritative patristic/Protestant legacy), scholastic Reformed authors (e.g., Voetius, Rutherford), polemical engagement with Arminians, Socinians, and Roman Catholic exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification, imputation, union with Christ, original sin, election, covenant (works and grace), law and gospel distinction, sanctification, adoption, perseverance, and eschatological admonitions (parousia, final judgment).
- **Closing line:** Turretin's Romans is a scholastic and pastoral consolidation of Reformed federal soteriology: rigorous forensic justification grounded in union with Christ, consistently interpreted for doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous forensic language: emphasis on legal categories (imputation, acquittal) and juridical union with Christ as the heart of Paul's argument.
 - Methodic pairing of close textual exegesis with scholastic theses and objections - a disciplined Reformed hermeneutic rather than speculative system‑building.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects perceived laxities of Arminian readings on justification and sanctification; counters Socinian denial of imputation; opposes Roman Catholic synergistic/readjustment readings of Pauline teaching.
 - Compared with later covenant revisers (e.g., Meredith Kline), Turretin represents a more classical federal schema and resists reinterpreting federal categories as primarily cultic or "intrusive" in the modern Klinean sense.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms, but a distinctive consolidation: systematic tying of Romans' forensic language to federal covenant terms used across loci in Reformed doctrine.
- **Reception and influence:** High authority in Reformed scholastic and confessional traditions; used extensively in later Reformed academies and by Princeton‑influenced theologians as a dependable scholastic exegetical resource. Later Covenant theologians cite Turretin as a representative classical source even when they diverge (e.g., Klinean revisions).
- **Enduring value:** Serves as an exemplar of how to marry close Pauline exegesis with confessional Reformed dogmatics and pastoral application - indispensable for studies of classic federalism and orthodox exegesis of Romans.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Forensic justification:** Legal acquittal of the believer by imputation of Christ's righteousness; central category for Turretin's reading of Romans.
- **Imputation (double imputation):** Sin imputed to Christ, Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; operative explanatory mechanism for justification.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological/relational ground for all Pauline soteriology (justification, sanctification, resurrection life).
- **Federal headship:** Adam and Christ as covenantal heads; Turretin uses this to explain corporate guilt/perdition and corporate salvation.
 - Relation to Kline: Turretin's federalism is classical and juridical; later Klinean treatments revise emphases but often appeal to Turretin as earlier terminus.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Distinct covenants structuring fall and redemption; Turretin articulates standard Reformed distinctions used to interpret Romans.
- **Law and Gospel distinction:** Function of the law (revealer of sin, civil constraint, guide for sanctification) versus gospel for justification; careful nuance about law's uses.
- **Original sin and corruption:** Doctrine of inherited guilt and depravity as explanatory premise for Paul's indictment in Romans.
- **Sanctification / good works:** Consequence of justification; ethical exhortation in Romans interpreted as necessary fruit, not ground, of salvation.
- **Parousia / eschatological readiness:** Turretin reads Pauline eschatological admonitions (e.g., Romans 13:11-12) as pastoral calls to vigilance; applied against speculative schemes about the "delay of the Parousia."
- **Righteousness of God:** Pauline forensic/relational righteousness - God's just action in justification is central to Turretin's exegesis.
- **Perseverance & assurance:** Doctrinal offshoots of union with Christ and imputation; Turretin defends objective grounds for assurance.
- **Polemic usages:** Turretin's exegesis functions as a classic resource in debates over justification, covenant structure, and law/gospel relations.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed formulations of imputation, federal headship, and covenant distinctions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans with rigorous philology, confessional theology, and pastoral application.
 - As a **polemical resource** in later disputes (e.g., responses to Klinean reframings of covenant theology and modern treatments of parousia/delay debates), often cited to represent the classical Reformed baseline.
