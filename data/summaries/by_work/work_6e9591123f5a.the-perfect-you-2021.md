### TITLE
The Perfect You (2021) - Andrew S. Farley

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical milieu (2021); follows Farley's prior pastoral/pop-evangelical works promoting freedom from legalism. Resonates with charismatic, therapeutic, and identity-focused strands of late 20th-21st century American Christianity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christians are **already perfect in Christ** in a definitive, positional sense; the primary pastoral problem is Christians living under condemnation and performance-driven sanctification.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reframes sanctification as primarily **definitive** (the believer's perfected status in union with Christ) rather than primarily progressive moral achievement.
 - Major moves:
 - Exegetical claim that New Testament language of being "perfect" (teleios) and commands to "be perfect" must be read in light of union with Christ and accomplished work, not as a summons to self-improvement.
 - Emphasizes imputed righteousness, union with Christ, and crucifixion of the old self as the ground of a believer's moral identity.
 - Pastoral application: remove performance-based guilt; embody grace through rest, faith, and the Spirit's fruit rather than duty-driven striving.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with Pauline theology (union with Christ, Romans), pastoral conversations, and contemporary evangelical leaders. Implicitly contrasts with legalistic or performance-oriented pastors and teachers; touches the Lordship/Free Grace debates without sustained historical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (definitive vs progressive), justification (imputation), union with Christ, the role of the Spirit, law and conscience, sin and condemnation, assurance.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: **positional perfection in Christ as the essential foundation for sanctified living**, with grace and identity replacing guilt-driven moral effort.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong pastoral insistence that believers possess a completed, definitive sanctification by virtue of union with Christ - lived out as identity rather than incremental achievement.
 - Emphasis on psychological and pastoral relief from condemnation; salvation's present-tense implications dominate the book.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to perceived evangelical legalism and the culture of moral performance.
 - Contrasts with traditional Reformed emphases that maintain a necessary, normative role for progressive sanctification and active mortification of sin.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes common categories:
 - Elevates the category of "definitive sanctification" and downplays the primacy of "progressive sanctification."
 - Uses language of "perfect you" to insist on realized positional status as the normative starting point for Christian ethics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Popular among pastors and lay readers seeking assurance and relief from guilt; influential in identity-focused and grace-centered counseling.
 - Criticized by some Reformed and evangelical theologians for risking antinomianism, minimizing Christian responsibility, and making broad exegetical claims without sustained historical-theological backing.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful pastoral corrective to legalism and for cultivating assurance; valuable in counseling contexts. Requires balancing with robust teaching on ongoing sanctification and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perfect / Perfection (teleios)** - Read primarily as positional perfection in Christ; not simply moral flawless behavior.
- **Definitive sanctification** - The believer's once-for-all status of being set apart and perfected in union with Christ.
- **Progressive sanctification** - Treated as secondary evidence or outworking, not the ground of salvation or primary basis for identity.
- **Union with Christ** - Central ontological locus for perfection and righteousness; believer's identity is "in Christ."
- **Imputed righteousness** - Righteous status given through Christ's work, foundational for the book's argument about perfection.
- **Old self crucified / new creation** - Used to assert that moral identity has been decisively transformed; the believer is not defined by past slavery to sin.
- **Rest (ceasing from self-effort)** - Pastoral practice urged: cease striving for righteousness as a merit and live by faith in completed work.
- **Grace-based living** - Mode of discipleship stressing reception and identity rather than rule-keeping.
- **No-condemnation** - Emphasis on Romans 8 promise as practical assurance against guilt.
- **Works as fruit, not basis** - Ethical behavior is positioned as evidence of life, not the currency of acceptance.
- **Legalism** - Target of critique; describes systems that make performance determinative of standing before God.
- **Assurance** - The pastoral outcome Farley seeks to recover via positional language.
- **Sanctifying Spirit** - Active in producing fruit, but framed as working from the secure basis of positional perfection.
- **Antinomian risk** - Frequent critical descriptor by opponents; a caution when employing Farley's theses.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary discussions of definitive sanctification and identity-based theology.
- As a **polemic** against evangelical legalism and performance-based pastoral practice.
- As a **pastoral/exegetical model** for counseling distressed believers seeking assurance; useful as a conceptual pivot but typically balanced by writings that emphasize progressive sanctification and Christian responsibility.
