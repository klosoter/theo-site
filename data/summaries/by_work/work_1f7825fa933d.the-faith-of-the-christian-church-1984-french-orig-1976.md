### TITLE
**Henri Blocher, The Faith of the Christian Church (French orig. 1976; Eng. 1984)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written in the later 20th century within French evangelical-Reformed circles; aimed at a general systematic presentation attentive to biblical exegesis and pastoral concerns.
 - Responds to both classical Reformed formulations and modern critics (existential, neo-orthodox, and liberal critiques), seeking a biblically grounded, orthodox synthesis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A comprehensive, Christ-centered exposition of the historic Christian faith that insists theological formulation remain firmly rooted in Scripture and pastoral conviction.
 - On sin specifically, Blocher examines the **nature and origin of sin** as a real, positive corruption of creaturely freedom that is at once personal and corporate, avoiding deterministic reductionisms.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: integrates biblical-theological exegesis with systematic formulation; resists abstraction divorced from Scripture.
 - Major moves regarding sin:
 - Distinguishes **structure** (human constitution, created goodness) from **act** (actual sinful choices).
 - Treats **origin** of sin in creaturely freedom: sin arises from the misuse of freedom rather than as a created defect.
 - Explores **original sin** as both inherited condition and corporate solidarity with Adam, while qualifying simplistic genetic or purely juridical readings.
 - Links the diagnosis of sin to the necessity of Christ's atoning and restorative work (second Adam motif).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Reformation tradition (especially Calvin), Augustine on depravity and concupiscence, and modern theologians across evangelical and academic spectra; dialogues with both Augustinian and anti-Augustinian emphases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Prominent loci: anthropology, sin (nature and origin), covenant, Christology (second Adam), atonement, grace and salvation, sanctification, ecclesiology, revelation, Trinity.
 - Emphasizes coherence between doctrine of sin and soteriology: diagnosis leads to Christocentric cure.

- **Closing line**
 - Blocher's work centers on a biblical-theological, Reformed faith that sees sin as a real, freedom-rooted distortion of humanity remedied only by the restorative work of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong biblical-theological method: doctrinal claims are continually tested against Scripture's narrative and exegetical detail.
 - Balanced account of original sin: affirms both corporate solidarity and personal culpability while resisting fatalism.
 - Focus on sin as a perversion of creaturely freedom (a positive corruption), not merely a privation in the abstract.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against deterministic Augustinian readings that efface genuine human responsibility.
 - Also corrects Pelagian minimizations by insisting on a pervasive moral corruption that requires divine remedy.
 - Critiques overly abstract metaphysical accounts of sin; insists on existential and covenantal dimensions.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of terms such as "solidarity," "structure vs act," and "freedom misused" to chart middle ground between inherited guilt and individual moral agency.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical and Reformed academic settings for clarity, pastoral sensitivity, and exegetical grounding.
 - Used in seminary courses as an accessible but serious systematic theology that bridges biblical studies and doctrinal formulation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a teaching text: readable, theologically orthodox, and helpful for situating the doctrine of sin within the whole of salvation history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**
 - Inherited condition and relational consequence of Adam's fall; both solidarity and real corruption are affirmed but explicated carefully to preserve responsibility.

- **Fall / Fallenness**
 - The event and state by which human nature becomes oriented away from God; described as radical yet not ontologically irremediable without grace.

- **Freedom (creaturely / moral)**
 - Human freedom is real and essential; sin is its misuse rather than a defect of freedom itself.

- **Privatio boni**
 - Treated critically: sin has privational aspects but also positive bentings and disorders; Blocher resists reducing sin to mere absence.

- **Structure vs Act**
 - Distinction used to separate human constitutive features (structure) from concrete sinful deeds (acts); both are implicated by the fall.

- **Federal headship / Solidarity**
 - Adam as representative head: solidarity explains corporate consequences, yet Blocher nuances imputation to avoid mechanistic guilt-transfer pictures.

- **Guilt vs Corruption**
 - Distinguishes forensic guilt (culpability before God) from ontological corruption (depraved desires and orientation); both require redemption.

- **Second Adam / Christology**
 - Christ as corrective and restorative head; his obedience and atonement reverse Adamic effects in covenantal terms.

- **Grace / Redemption**
 - Divine initiative that heals corrupted freedom and restores covenantal relationship; soteriology flows directly from diagnosis of sin.

- **Covenant framework**
 - Sin and salvation are read within covenant history: fall breaks covenantal trust; Christ reinstates covenant fidelity.

- **Imputation (qualified)**
 - Affirms imputation in soteriology but offers a tempered account when applied to Adamic guilt to maintain human responsibility.

- **Sanctification (progressive)**
 - Ongoing cure of corrupted affections and reorientation of freedom through Spirit and means of grace.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced Reformed account of original sin and human depravity.
- As a **polemic** against both deterministic Augustinianism and Pelagian minimism.
- As an **exegetical-model** for anchoring doctrinal claims in Scripture's narrative and covenantal structure.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology, sin, and Christology in teaching and pastoral theology.
