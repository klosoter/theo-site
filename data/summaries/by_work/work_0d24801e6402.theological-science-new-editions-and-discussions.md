### TITLE
Theological Science (Thomas F. Torrance) - notes on editions and contemporary discussions

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑20th century postwar theological milieu; rooted in Scottish Reformed tradition and the Barthian revival; written amid rapid advances in modern physics and debates over scientific realism, logical positivism, and theology's epistemic status.
 - Renewed interest via later editions and secondary literature that press Torrance's dialogue with natural science and epistemology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology can and must be a disciplined, objectively intelligible "science" (scientia theologiae) whose method and criteria are shaped by the Triune God's self‑revelation in Christ and thus capable of true knowledge of God and reality.
 - Problem addressed: how theology can avoid subjectivism, mere apologetics, or scientism while remaining faithful to revelation and intellectually responsible in a scientific age.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology is a form of knowledge analogous to natural science insofar as it is disciplined, reality‑oriented, testable within its own field, and communal - but its epistemic ground is not empirical autonomy but divine self‑disclosure.
 - Theological method must be:
 - Christocentric and Trinitarian (the Word as the decisive epistemic event).
 - Realist about divine and created realities; rejects reduction to metaphor or mere symbol.
 - Sensitive to the theory‑laden character of observation and to disciplinary norms; theological propositions are accountable to the objective truth they seek to describe.
 - Interaction with natural science: mutual intelligibility through a shared commitment to reality and realism, not assimilation or subordination of theology to scientific method.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Karl Barth (theological revelation), Patristic and Reformed sources (Athanasius, Calvin), and contemporary philosophers/scientists (critique of logical positivism, appreciation of modern physics and epistemic realism, frequent appeal to physicists' methodological insights).
 - Polemical target: subjectivist and liberal theologies, naive natural theology, and reductionist scientism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology (central), Trinity (ontological and epistemological ground), doctrine of creation (as the basis for intelligibility), theological language and analogy, knowledge of God, and implications for doctrine formation.

- **Closing line**
 - Theology's center of gravity: a Trinitarian, Christ‑centred "scientific" pursuit of truth - objective, disciplined, and governed by the reality of God revealed in Christ and witnessed by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm integration of theological epistemology with contemporary scientific realism; theology as a rigorous cognitive discipline modeled on scientific practice but grounded in revelation.
 - Strong insistence that the doctrine of the Trinity secures both ontology and epistemology: knowledge of God arises in relation to God's self‑giving.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects classical analogia entis as an autonomous bridge between God and world; instead favors a relational/Christic analogy anchored in revelation.
 - Critiques both liberal correlationism (theology answering human questions) and reductive scientism (science as sole arbiter of truth).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re‑appropriates "science" for theology (scientia theologiae) without collapsing theological distinctiveness.
 - Emphasizes "theological realism" and the idea of "testing" theological propositions against the normativity of revealed truth.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed and ecumenical circles concerned with method; significant for theologians engaging science‑theology dialogue.
 - Provoked debate: praised for methodological seriousness and Trinitarian depth; critiqued for analogies with natural science and alleged scientism by some theological critics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust methodological alternative to both apologetic eclecticism and relativistic theology; valuable for integrating doctrinal fidelity with intellectual seriousness in the scientific age.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological science (scientia theologiae)** - theology as disciplined, objective inquiry founded on revelation.
- **Theological realism** - commitment that theological statements correspond to divine and created realities, not merely human constructs.
- **Trinitarian ontology / epistemology** - the Trinity as the ontological and epistemic ground of knowledge of God.
- **Christocentrism** - Christ as the decisive epistemic event; revelation measured and mediated by the Word incarnate.
- **Analogy of relation (vs. analogy of being)** - analogy grounded in the relational self‑disclosure of God rather than an autonomous ontological likeness.
- **Theory‑laden observation** - the claim that perception and interpretation are shaped by theoretical commitments (borrowed from philosophy of science).
- **Rejection of autonomous natural theology** - denies unaided human reason can reach God apart from revealed, Trinitarian mediation.
- **Epistemic testability (theological testing)** - theological propositions are accountable to the reality they purport to describe; communal and doctrinal adjudication matters.
- **Anti‑subjectivism** - counters personalist or existential reductions of doctrine.
- **Communal discipline** - theology's scientific status depends on ecclesial, confessional, and communal practices of judgment.
- **Integration with natural science** - dialogue predicated on mutual realism, not assimilation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **methodological definition source** for courses on theology and science or theological epistemology.
- As a **polemic tool** against both liberal correlationism and scientism in doctrinal method.
- As an **exegetical and doctrinal model** for constructing Trinitarian and Christocentric systematic theology grounded in revelation.
