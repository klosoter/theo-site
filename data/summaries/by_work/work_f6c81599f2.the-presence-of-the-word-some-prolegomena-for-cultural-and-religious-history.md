### TITLE
**The Presence of the Word: Some Prolegomena for Cultural and Religious History** - Walter J. Ong

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century cultural/intellectual milieu (Ong: Jesuit scholar, classical philology and media studies). Written against a backdrop of post-war attention to mass media, literacy studies, and renewed interest in patristic and medieval thought.
 - Interdisciplinary project linking classical rhetoric, medieval liturgy, patristics, and emerging media theory.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The experience and theological meaning of the "Word" (logos/sermo) are historically mediated: cultures differ in how the Word is physically and socially present. Theologico-cultural categories (revelation, sacrament, preaching, Scripture) presuppose media conditions that shape how presence is experienced and conceived.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-phenomenological tracing of how oral and literate media produce different senses of presence.
 - Analysis of liturgy, preaching, and sacramental practice to show how communal memory, vocal performance, and embodied rites instantiate the Word.
 - Examination of transitions (oral -> manuscript -> print -> mass media) and their theological consequences for authority, interiority, and communal identity.
 - Implication: theological claims about immediacy and efficacy of the Word must be read with attention to media and rhetorical forms.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Extensive use of patristic and medieval sources (Augustine and medieval homiletic/liturgical texts are central), classical rhetorical tradition, and contemporary media thinkers (shared thematic concerns with scholars like McLuhan).
 - Dialogues implicitly with Enlightenment/modern accounts of text, authorship, and subjectivity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: how revelation is apprehended as present or mediated.
 - **Sacramentality**: liturgy and sacraments as modes of embodied presence.
 - **Scripture and authority**: text versus spoken Word; transmission and communal memory.
 - **Ecclesiology and homiletics**: the church as locus where the Word is made present.
 - **Interiority and moral formation**: inner speech and memory shaped by media practices.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - The theological reality of the Word cannot be abstracted from the historical, rhetorical, and media forms that make it present to human communities; understanding theology requires attending to the technologies and performances that instantiate presence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats sacrament, liturgy, sermon, and Scripture as historically conditioned media of presence rather than timeless categories detached from communicative form.
 - Emphasizes the bodily, vocal, and communal performance of the Word as constitutive for theological meaning.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters purely textualist or documental accounts of theology that prioritize written Scripture over oral and performative dimensions.
 - Challenges narratives that treat modern literate/print culture as transparent and neutral; shows how each media regime reconfigures theological concepts (e.g., authority, interiority).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of a media-historical lens to analyze "presence" (rather than purely metaphysical or hermeneutical accounts).
 - Operationalizes distinctions along an orality-literacy continuum to explain shifts in theological consciousness.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Widely read in liturgical studies, homiletics, sacramental theology, and theological anthropology; has become a resource for those reclaiming embodied and communal aspects of worship.
 - Used across confessional lines: valued by scholars interested in historical theology, preaching, and media theology; less cited as doctrinal theology in confessional Reformed systematic works but influential in methodological debates.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a durable framework for connecting media history and theology; indispensable for courses on homiletics, liturgy, doctrinal history of revelation/sacramentality, and theology of communication.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presence (of the Word)** - The felt immediacy and efficacy by which the Word is perceived to act in a community; historically mediated.
- **Orality** - Socially embodied, communal, vocal mode of communication that foregrounds performance and memory (contrast with literate modes).
- **Literacy (manuscript/print)** - Technologies that reconfigure interiority, authorship, and fixity of text; diminish certain kinds of vocal presence.
- **Sacramental presence** - Ways liturgy and rite make divine realities present through embodied sign-acts; analyzed as media phenomena.
- **Homiletic presence** - The preacher's vocational embodiment of the Word; rhetoric and voice as theological instruments.
- **Communal memory** - Social practice of remembering theological identity mediated by oral and ritual forms rather than only texts.
- **Embodiment/Performance** - The bodily and enactment-based locus where theological meaning is produced and received.
- **Technologies of consciousness** - How media (oral, written, print, electronic) shape modes of thinking, knowing, and spiritual experience.
- **Inner speech** - A psychological correlate of media change; interior dialogue shaped by literacy practices.
- **Orality-literacy continuum** - Analytical scale used to track cultural shifts in the experience of the Word.
- **Mediation** - The unavoidable role of cultural and technological means in presenting revelation.
- **Authority (textual vs. performative)** - Tension between fixed textual authority and situational, performative authority of speech/rite.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in liturgical theology and homiletics to recover embodied presence and communal performance.
 - As a **hermeneutical model** for reading patristic and medieval texts that privileges rhetorical and ritual contexts over modern textualist readings.
 - As a **polemic/resource** in critiques of modernity's disembodiment (media theology) and in defenses of sacramental and corporate models of revelation.
