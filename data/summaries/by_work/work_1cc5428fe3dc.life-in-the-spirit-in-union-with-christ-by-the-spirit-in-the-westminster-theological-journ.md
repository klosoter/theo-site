### TITLE
Life in the Spirit: In Union with Christ by the Spirit - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., The Westminster Theological Journal (article). 
Focus: Reformed exegesis and dogmatics on sanctification as both definitive (positional) and progressive (experiential) rooted in union with Christ through the Spirit.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed theological conversation (post-1970s), reacting to both pietistic experientialism and Wesleyan "entire sanctification" currents.
 - Situated in ongoing scholarly retrieval of Pauline theology and classic Reformed covenantal thinking; dialogue with Westminster tradition and contemporary exegetical trends.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sanctification must be understood fundamentally as participation in Christ by the Spirit: believers are both definitively sanctified in union with Christ and progressively sanctified in life - these are not competing categories but properly related aspects of one Spirit-wrought reality.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base: Pauline texts (esp. Romans, 1 Corinthians, Galatians) that tie Spirit, union, and ethical life.
 - The Spirit unites believers to Christ; that union is the ground for both a definitive (positional, forensic/ontological) sanctification and a progressive (moral/experiential) sanctification.
 - Definitive: believers are set apart in Christ as a status given by God; this is objective, eschatologically secured, and grounded in Christ's work.
 - Progressive: the Spirit effects ongoing mortification and vivification, producing growth in holiness that flows from the believer's real union.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Rejects bifurcation that turns definitive sanctification into mere legal label without ontological change.
 - Opposes Wesleyan perfectionist readings that collapse progressive sanctification into a single momental attainment.
 - Counters pietistic or moralistic accounts that make sanctification depend primarily on human effort or subjective experience.
 - Theological synthesis: the Spirit is both the agent who constitutes union and the operative power of sanctification, preserving the objective guarantees of salvation while accounting for experiential growth and struggle.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Pauline corpus; Reformers/Westminster divines for covenantal and forensic categories; contemporary theologians debating definitive vs progressive sanctification and the role of Spirit (Wesleyan, Holiness tradition, pietism).
 - Implicit engagement with modern exegetical trends that separate ethical transformation from ontological union.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (definitive and progressive), union with Christ, Spiritology (person and work of the Holy Spirit), soteriology (justification and adoption as related to sanctification), eschatology (already/not yet), ecclesiology (baptism, sacraments as signs/seals).
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers sanctification theologically on **Spirit-wrought union with Christ**, preserving objective covenantal status and ongoing experiential growth as mutually informing dimensions of Christian life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that union with Christ (mediated and effected by the Spirit) is the primary theological category that explains both definitive and progressive sanctification.
 - Firm link between objective (status) and subjective (experience) dimensions without collapsing one into the other.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects accounts that treat definitive sanctification as merely forensic or nominal; restores an ontological sense rooted in new creation union.
 - Counters Wesleyan-Holiness emphasis on instantaneous eradication of sin and pietistic moralism that downplays objective union.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Use of "in union with Christ by the Spirit" as a compact theological formula tying Pneumatology to soteriological status and ethical process.
 - Clarifies language around "definitive" (positional/eschatological reality already given) vs "progressive" (temporal, Spirit-driven sanctification).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly regarded in conservative Reformed studies for sharpening union Christology and integrating Pauline exegesis with confessional categories.
 - Used by scholars and pastors to resist both perfectionist and purely experiential models of sanctification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced, biblically rooted model for teaching sanctification in systematic theology, pastoral care, and preaching; valuable for courses on Pneumatology, soteriology, and Reformed ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - central relational/ontological category grounding sanctification.
- **The Spirit (Holy Spirit)** - agent who effects and sustains union and progressive sanctification.
- **Definitive sanctification** - the believer's set-apart status in Christ, given objectively and eschatologically secured.
- **Progressive sanctification** - ongoing ethical transformation, mortification and vivification, worked by the Spirit.
- **Positional vs. experiential** - distinction maintained and integrated: position in Christ and lived experience flow from union.
- **New creation** - motif for ontological change tied to union; sanctification as participation in Christ's new life.
- **Already / Not-yet** - eschatological frame: definitive reality already secured; progressive fulfillment awaits consummation.
- **Forensic/ontological tension** - Gaffin dissolves a false dichotomy: justification/sanctification interplay through union.
- **Mortification and vivification** - practical categories for progressive sanctification as Spirit-led dying to sin and rising in Christ.
- **Seal and witness** - sacramental and experiential marks of the Spirit's presence (e.g., baptism, assurance).
- **Appropriation** - the applied experience of what is objectively true in Christ (not a re-justification but a realized growth).
- **Anti-perfectionism** - corrective stance toward instantaneous sanctification models.
- **Covenantal framing** - treating sanctification within the covenantal promises and administration (Westminster heritage).
- **Pauline exegesis** - method: using apostolic texts to anchor theological categories.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for integrating Pneumatology and soteriology: anchors sanctification language in union with Christ.
- As a polemical resource against Wesleyan/perfectionist and pietistic models of sanctification.
- As an exegetical model for reading Pauline texts that link Spirit, baptism, and ethical life.
