### TITLE
**No Other God: A Response to Open Theism** - John M. Frame (P&R, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th/early-21st-century evangelical controversy: response to the resurgence of Open Theism (Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd, Hasker).
 - Written from a Reformed, classical-theist perspective; intended for pastors, scholars, and seminarians concerned about doctrinal and pastoral consequences.
- **Central thesis**
 - Open Theism is theologically and philosophically untenable because it undermines classical attributes of God (omnipotence, exhaustive foreknowledge, immutability, simplicity, aseity) and thereby weakens divine sovereignty, providence, prophecy, and pastoral assurances (prayer, hope, gospel certainty).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical critique
 - Close readings of key OT and NT texts invoked by open theists (prophecy, prayer narratives, divine repentance language).
 - Argues those texts presuppose divine foreknowledge and sovereign decree, not epistemic openness.
 - Philosophical-theological defense of classical attributes
 - Articulates how omniscience (definite foreknowledge) coheres with divine immutability and simplicity.
 - Defends Reformed compatibilist account of human freedom alongside divine determinative providence.
 - Diagnostic and pastoral moves
 - Shows practical problems: diminished trust in promises, unstable doctrine of prayer, weakened assurance of salvation and providence.
 - Polemic against alternatives
 - Engages Open Theists directly; compares and contrasts with Molinism/middle knowledge as another non-classical response.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Primary opponents: Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Greg Boyd, William Hasker (Open Theists).
 - Secondary engagement with Molinist formulations (Luis de Molina; contemporary proponents like William Lane Craig) as alternative attempts to reconcile freedom and foreknowledge.
 - Uses classical sources (Augustine, Aquinas implicitly via classical theism) and Reformed tradition (Calvinian emphases on sovereignty).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper: omniscience, immutability, simplicity, aseity, impassibility.
 - Providence: meticulous providence, concurrence, problem of evil.
 - Trinity: distinction of economic vs ontological relations; discussion touches eternal functional subordination debates.
 - Anthropology/Soteriology: sin, libertarian vs compatibilist free will, pastoral assurance.
 - Revelation/Scripture: prophecy, divine speech acts, inspiration and reliability.
- **Closing line**
 - A compact defense of classical Reformed theism: God's exhaustive, sovereign knowledge and control are essential to biblical faith, pastoral confidence, and orthodox doctrine - Open Theism fractures that center.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Integrates rigorous philosophical-theological argumentation with pastoral concerns; not merely abstract metaphysics but an account of what belief in God makes possible for prayer, assurance, and mission.
 - Uses a Reformed, compatibilist anthropology as central to resolving the foreknowledge/freedom tension rather than relativizing divine attributes.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Open Theists by (1) insisting biblical anthropomorphic language does not undermine divine immutability/omniscience, (2) showing that alleged biblical "change" in God is compatibly relational and rhetorical.
 - Distinguishes his critique from Molinist solutions: Molinism tries to preserve libertarian free will via middle knowledge; Frame argues this either compromises divine sovereignty or introduces problematic modal notions.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Applies triperspectival and systematic-methodological clarity (though not always foregrounded as a full triperspectival treatise) to show how doctrines function across normative, situational, and existential loci.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical critiques of Open Theism; used in seminary syllabi and pastoral training.
 - Praised by many for combining philosophical rigor with pastoral sensitivity; critiqued by some for underestimating certain biblical-theological moves of Open Theists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical and polemical resource: clarifies stakes, marshals biblical and philosophical arguments, and models integration of doctrine and pastoral praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism**
 - The view that God does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of future free actions; the future is partly open.
- **Classical Theism**
 - Traditional doctrine of God as timeless/eternal, immutable, simple, omniscient, and sovereign.
- **Omniscience (definite foreknowledge)**
 - God knows all truths, including actual future free choices; contrasted with the Open Theist claim of epistemic openness.
- **Divine Immutability**
 - God does not undergo ontological change; Frame argues biblical change-words are relational or rhetorical.
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God's attributes are identical with his being; used to defend coherence of omniscience and aseity.
- **Aseity & Impassibility**
 - God's self-existence and freedom from uncontrolled passion; Frame links these to reliable providence and promise-keeping.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism**
 - The doctrine that God knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (middle knowledge); Frame critiques it as unsatisfactory alternative to classical foreknowledge and sovereignty.
- **Providence (meticulous providence)**
 - God's sovereign governance of all events; Frame defends a robust divine causality compatible with responsible agency.
- **Compatibilist Freedom**
 - Human freedom understood as voluntary action consistent with divine determinative causation; Frame favors this over libertarian freedom.
- **Prophecy & Divine Speech Acts**
 - Prophecy functions on assumption of divine foreknowledge and providential execution; Frame uses prophetic texts to rebut openness claims.
- **Economic vs Ontological Trinity**
 - Distinguishes roles/relations in history (economic) from inner being (ontological); used to resist conflating relational language with ontological mutability.
- **Divine Condescension**
 - How God accommodates language and action to human finitude; Frame insists accommodation does not erase classical divine attributes.
- **Prayer**
 - Practical test-case: genuine, effective prayer presupposes God's knowledge and covenantal reliability.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **concise definition and defense** of classical theism against Open Theism in theology proper courses.
 - As a **polemic** and primary assigned reading in surveys of contemporary evangelical controversies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading prophetic and prayer texts against "openness" readings.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting doctrines of God to pastoral concerns (assurance, prayer, providence).
