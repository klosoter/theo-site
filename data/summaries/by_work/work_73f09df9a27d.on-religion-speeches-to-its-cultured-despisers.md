### TITLE
On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers (Ueber die Religion. Reden an die Gebildeten unter ihren Verächtern) - Friedrich Schleiermacher (1799)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 1799 amid German Romanticism and post-Enlightenment criticisms of Christianity.
 - Reaction to Enlightenment rationalists, educated skeptics, and the pietistic/formalistic decline of confessional religion.
 - Interlocutors include Kantian epistemology, Enlightenment deism, and early secular critics of religion.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Religion is not primarily doctrine or moralism but the *immediate* awareness (feeling) of the **absolute dependence** upon the infinite. The speeches defend the legitimacy and necessity of religion against cultured contempt.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Define religion as a distinctive mode of consciousness - the feeling of absolute dependence; distinguish it from ethical and speculative modes.
 - Part II: Show how religion manifests historically in dogma, cult, and ethical life without being reducible to them; defend its cognitive legitimacy as a sui generis form of experience.
 - Part III: Address objections from rationalists and moralists, arguing for religion's epistemic and existential indispensability.
 - Major moves:
 - Re-center theological method on experience (subjective religious consciousness).
 - Reinterpret revelation as the origination and transmission of religious feeling within communities.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Enlightenment critics and transforms Kantian limits on theoretical reason into a positive account of religious feeling.
 - Draws on Pietist spiritual resources reframed by Romantic aesthetics.

- **Doctrines treated (implicit and explicit)**
 - Revelation and faith (reconceived as religious consciousness).
 - Christology (Jesus as exemplar of perfect God-consciousness; more fully developed later).
 - Ecclesiology (church as community of shared religious feeling; role of sacraments reinterpreted).
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as life of religious community, source of illumination).
 - Anthropology and sin (sin as disruption/deficiency of religious feeling and wholeness).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Religion is a presuppositive, existential mode of being centered in the feeling of absolute dependence; theology must begin with and account for this immediate religious self-consciousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Pivotal phrase: **"feeling of absolute dependence"** - locates religious knowledge in affective immediacy rather than propositional assent.
 - Prioritizes *religious experience* over doctrinal formulation and moral law.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects Enlightenment reductionism by arguing that reason cannot exhaust religious reality.
 - Critiques pietistic moralism that equates religion with ethics or external observance.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts revelation as communal **religious consciousness** and transmission of feeling.
 - Introduces a methodological subjectivism that becomes central to modern liberal theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on 19th-century Protestant liberalism, modern epistemologies of religion, and theological hermeneutics.
 - Criticized by conservative Reformed and orthodox theologians for alleged subjectivism and for deprioritizing objective revelation and classical metaphysics (e.g., Trinity, traditional Christology).

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable diagnostic for secular-religious conflict; useful for pastoral apologetics, phenomenology of religion, and theology that seeks to integrate experience, aesthetics, and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - core definitional locus of religion; non-propositional, existential awareness of the infinite.
- **Religious self-consciousness / God-consciousness** - the subject's immediate awareness of relation to God; basis for faith and religious life.
- **Revelation (reinterpreted)** - not merely propositional disclosure but the originating and communal communication of religious feeling.
- **Faith** - experiential trust grounded in religious consciousness rather than only assent to doctrines.
- **Church** - a community constituted by shared religious feeling; sacraments are expressive and formative of that feeling.
- **Holy Spirit** - the life and unifying consciousness of the ecclesial community; the agent of religious transmission and illumination in experience.
- **Sin** - understood psychologically and existentially as alienation or deficiency in God-consciousness, not primarily forensic categories.
- **Christ / Incarnation** - Jesus as the archetype and perfect realization of God-consciousness; incarnation read existentially rather than metaphysically.
- **Assurance** - rooted in persistent religious feeling and communal confirmation rather than objective forensic certainties.
- **Anthropology (eschatological hints)** - human destiny and perfection conceived as the consummation of full God-consciousness.
- **Traducianism vs Creationism** - largely non-committal in this text; Schleiermacher treats human spiritual life phenomenologically rather than metaphysically about soul origin.
- **Illumination / Revelation Role of Spirit** - Spirit as the medium through which religious consciousness is formed and maintained.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for religion as experiential and affective (useful in anthropology & doctrine of creation).
 - As a **polemic** against Enlightenment rationalism and moral reductionism (useful in doctrinal and apologetic loci).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Christ and Spirit in existential/ethical categories rather than classical metaphysical ones (Christology, Pneumatology, Ecclesiology).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in modern debates over assurance, sin, and the nature of the church - often deployed to justify theological methods that center experience.
