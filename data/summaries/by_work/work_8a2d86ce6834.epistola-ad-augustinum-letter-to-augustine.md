### TITLE
**Epistola ad Augustinum (Letter to Augustine)** - Prosper of Aquitaine

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-5th century Gaul (c. 430s), in the immediate aftermath of Augustine's work against Pelagius; Prosper is a layman/intellectual in Marseilles/Aquitaine engaged in the Pelagian controversy.
 - The letter forms part of Prosper's correspondence and apologetic activity defending Augustine's theology before Gallic clergy influenced by Pelagian and semi-Pelagian ideas.
 - The broader milieu: post-Roman theological disputes over grace, free will, and human responsibility (Pelagianism, responses by Augustine, and local resistance).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate Augustine's position that saving grace is antecedent, efficacious, and necessary; to repel Pelagian and semi-Pelagian claims that human will can initiate justification without prior divine aid.
 - To assert a robust doctrine of original sin and divine predestination grounded in scriptural and patristic authority.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirmation of Augustine's basic soteriology: humanity's incapacity after the Fall, the necessity of prevenient and efficacious grace, and divine election.
 - Rebuttal of opponents:
 - Denies Pelagian denial of inherited guilt and affirmation of autonomous moral capability.
 - Counters semi-Pelagian compromises that posit an initial human step toward God without grace.
 - Uses biblical exegesis (Pauline emphases), conciliar/formulaic proofs, and appeal to tradition to show continuity with orthodoxy.
 - Calls for ecclesial conformity to Augustine's conclusions as the safeguard of doctrinal unity in Gaul.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Direct interlocutor: Augustine (recipient and theological exemplar).
 - Opponents named or implied: Pelagius, Julian of Eclanum, disciples and local clerics sympathetic to Cassianizing or semi-Pelagian tendencies.
 - Sources: Scripture (esp. Paul), Augustine's corpus, patristic witnesses, and local ecclesiastical practice.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Grace (gratia): prevenient, efficacious, and irresistible in effect when given for salvation.
 - Free will (liberum arbitrium): true will exists but is incapacitated by sin to will initial good without grace.
 - Original sin (peccatum originis) and inherited guilt.
 - Predestination (praedestinatio/electio) and divine foreknowledge.
 - Baptism, merit, perseverance, and the cooperation of sanctifying grace.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The letter places **sovereign, antecedent divine grace** at the heart of salvation: human will is real but dependent upon prevenient and efficacious grace to begin and persevere in the life of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp insistence on the *efficaciousness* of grace (gratia efficax) as the decisive move against any theology that grants the initiating step to human volition.
 - Tendency to articulate predestination in uncompromising terms as a theological safeguard against Pelagian optimism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Pelagius by reaffirming inherited guilt and the need for grace.
 - Distinct from John Cassian and others labeled semi-Pelagian by later readers: Prosper stresses Augustine's priority of grace over any human contribution.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularization and dissemination of Augustinian vocabulary in Gallic circles; helped to stabilize terms like *praedestinatio*, *gratia efficax*, and the polemical category later called "semi-Pelagianism."
 - Moves Augustine's more technical Latin theology into pastoral and ecclesial polemic.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Important in shaping Gallic reception of Augustine; contributed to the theological atmosphere that produced the Council of Orange (529), which affirmed prevenient grace while rejecting Pelagianism and certain deterministic excesses.
 - Loved by later reformers (Reformation and post-Reformation Protestants) as a patristic witness to strong doctrines of grace; used by Jansenists as a patristic authority as well.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concentrated model of early Augustinian polemic: compact, scripturally anchored, and useful for teaching on grace, free will, and original sin.
 - Valuable primary evidence for how Augustine's theology was defended, interpreted, and transmitted in the West.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gratia (grace)** - divine favor necessary for salvation; central operative power.
- **Gratia preveniens (prevenient grace)** - grace that precedes any human act; enables will to respond.
- **Gratia efficax (efficacious grace)** - not merely sufficient but effectually brings about what it intends (conversion).
- **Liberum arbitrium (free will)** - affirmed but weakened; cannot effect initial turning without grace.
- **Peccatum originis (original sin)** - inherited corruption and guilt impairing all human powers.
- **Praedestinatio (predestination/election)** - divine foreordination of the saved, grounded in God's will and grace.
- **Meritum (merit)** - human "merit" is reinterpreted as participation enabled only by prior grace.
- **Cooperatio (cooperation)** - cooperation of the will to grace is real but secondary to grace's initiating action.
- **Perseverantia (perseverance)** - perseverance in faith is both gift and a sign of election, sustained by grace.
- **Pelagianism** - denial of original sin and of the necessity of prevenient grace; primary antagonist.
- **Semi-Pelagianism** - later label for positions asserting an initial human move; Prosper combats these tendencies.
- **Scripture (Pauline emphasis)** - used as primary proof-text base, esp. Romans and Galatians.
- **Patristic appeal** - Augustine as norm; other fathers marshalled as supportive.
- **Conciliar impact** - immediate use in local synodal decisions and long-term influence on councils (e.g., Orange).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic source**: concise patristic vindication of Augustine against Pelagian and semi-Pelagian rivals.
 - As an **exegetical and soteriological model**: exemplar for arguing from Pauline texts to doctrines of grace and predestination.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in the history of Western doctrine of grace - a bridge between Augustine's theology and later medieval, Reformation, and post-Reformation debates.
