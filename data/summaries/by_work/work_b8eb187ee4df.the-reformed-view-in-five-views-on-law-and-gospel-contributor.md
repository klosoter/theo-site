### TITLE
The Reformed View (Sinclair B. Ferguson) - chapter in Five Views on Law and Gospel

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed conversation about the law-gospel distinction; aimed at clarifying confessional Reformed praxis for preaching, pastoral care, and catechesis.
 - Positioned against both Lutheran polarities that sharply separate law and gospel and antinomian tendencies within some evangelical circles.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The law and the gospel are distinct in function and proclamation but inseparably related within the covenantal structure of God's dealings with humanity: the gospel fulfills, interprets and transforms the law through Christ while the law remains a normative, formative rule for the Christian life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis of the biblical data for law and gospel (Pauline and Gospel traditions) to establish functional distinctions (condemnation, guidance, covenantal obligation).
 - Systematic retrieval of covenant theology:
 - Covenant of works explains the law's demand and condemnation.
 - Covenant of grace explains fulfillment in Christ and the re-creation of obedience.
 - Pastoral and homiletical implications: how to preach law and gospel without collapsing their distinction or divorcing them.
 - Practical doctrine of sanctification: the law as mirror, tutor, and guide for the redeemed (with attention to dangers of legalism and antinomianism).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: John Calvin, Westminster Confession and catechisms, Puritan pastoral theology.
 - Opponents/contrasts: Lutheran formulations of law/gospel dichotomy, antinomian and legalistic tendencies in modern evangelicalism.
 - Contemporary interlocutors in the volume (various views collected) - Ferguson frames a Reformed corrective to other received positions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutic of law and gospel)
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace)
 - Christology (Christ as fulfiller of the law; obedience imputed and imparted)
 - Justification and sanctification (distinct but inseparable benefits of the gospel)
 - Ecclesiology/pastoral theology (preaching, catechesis, discipleship)

- **Closing line**
 - A covenantal, Christ-centered account: the gospel fulfills and frees, the law convicts and guides - together they shape faithful proclamation and Christian obedience without collapsing into either antinomianism or works-righteousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal framing: law and gospel placed within covenant of works/ covenant of grace dynamics rather than merely functional or homiletical categories.
 - Emphasis on continuity of moral law: the moral law remains normative for believers but is fulfilled in and applied through union with Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects a sharp Lutheran-style polarity that treats law and gospel as nearly antithetical in content and function.
 - Opposes antinomian readings that treat gospel as permission for moral laxity and opposes legalistic readings that make law the route to acceptance.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces the language of law as both covenant demand and ongoing rule of life mediated by Christ - less novel terminology than a rearticulation of classic Reformed categories for pastoral use.
 - Clarifies the threefold and pastoral uses of the law within a covenantal schema (condemnation, civil/social order, normative guide for sanctified life).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed homiletical and pastoral contexts as a concise statement defending a covenantal Reformed approach to law/gospel.
 - Influential among pastors and teachers seeking a middle way that preserves gospel centrality while affirming moral obligation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, pastoral articulation of how to preach law and gospel in Reformed churches.
 - Useful bridge between confessional theology and contemporary pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law**
 - The divine command reflecting God's righteous requirement; functions as condemnation, guide, and social restraint.

- **Gospel**
 - The proclamation of God's gracious fulfillment of the law in Christ - justification, forgiveness, and newness of life.

- **Covenant of Works**
 - The covenantal framework explaining original law-demand and human accountability prior to Christ.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The framework wherein Christ fulfills the law and graciously imputes/infuses righteousness to believers.

- **Moral Law**
 - The enduring ethical content (esp. Ten Commandments) that continues to instruct the redeemed.

- **Threefold uses of the law**
 - Mirror (convicts of sin), curb (restrains evil in society), guide (norm for Christian life and sanctification).

- **Antinomianism**
 - The error of denying the law's normative role for Christians - critiqued and guarded against.

- **Legalism / Works-righteousness**
 - The error of seeking acceptance by obedience; countered by stress on justification by faith alone.

- **Fulfillment in Christ**
 - Christ's perfect obedience and suffering that satisfy the law's demands and inaugurate the gospel.

- **Imputation and Impartation**
 - Imputation: Christ's righteousness credited to believers (justification).
 - Impartation: Christ's life formed in believers (sanctification) - both related to law/gospel dynamics.

- **Law of Christ**
 - New-covenant expression of God's will shaping Christian obedience (love-centered fulfillment of the law).

- **Hermeneutic / Homiletic priority**
 - Gospel-centered reading that interprets law in light of Christ's person and work.

How the work is used across loci
- As a **definition source**: concise, confessional statement of Reformed law-gospel relations.
- As a **polemic**: corrective to both Lutheran extremes and evangelical antinomianism/legalism.
- As an **exegetical-homiletical model**: applied guidance for preaching law and gospel pastorally.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in covenantal theology courses to connect doctrine of sin, atonement, and sanctification.
