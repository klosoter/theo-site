### TITLE
For the Love of God (devotional reflections on spiritual gifts) - D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary evangelical/Reformed milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Part of Carson's broader devotional and pastoral writing that seeks to bring rigorous biblical scholarship into daily Christian formation amid the charismatic renewal and ongoing debates about post-apostolic gifts.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 How should Christians understand, seek, exercise, and test spiritual gifts in a way that is biblically faithful, pastorally prudent, and conducive to love and edification in the church? The devotional aim reframes the theological controversy as a spiritual formation issue rather than merely a technical doctrinal dispute.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Begins with biblical exposition of key gift passages (1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12, Ephesians 4), emphasizing context and purpose: edification, unity, order. 
 - Moves to pastoral reflection on the moral and spiritual dispositions required for gift use (humility, love, sobriety). 
 - Offers practical guidance for testing gifts, recognizing false or immature manifestations, and aligning practice with Scripture and church order. 
 - Concludes with devotional exhortations to seek the Spirit's fruit and to prefer love above conspicuous gifts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages broadly with both continuationist and cessationist literature; interlocutors implied include classical cessationist voices (e.g., Warfield-style concerns about revelatory claims) and contemporary charismatic scholars (e.g., Grudem, Piper, Stott-adjacent voices). 
 - Draws on biblical commentators, historical church practice, and pastoral experience rather than technical pneumatology alone.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Pneumatology** (operation and scope of the Spirit) 
 - **Revelation** (normative Scripture vs. purported new revelations) 
 - **Ecclesiology** (order, governance, corporate edification) 
 - **Soteriology/Christian life** (holiness, sanctification as context for gift use) 
 - Subsidiary touch on hermeneutics and authority.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Spiritual gifts must be pursued and exercised under the lordship of Christ and the governing love of Scripture and the church-gifts are means to edify, not ends in themselves.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats gift controversies devotionally: theological reflection is integrated with pastoral formation and prayerful humility. 
 - Prioritizes **love and edification** as the controlling categories for evaluating gifts over sensationalism or programmatic utility.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Balances between strict cessationism (which may close off legitimate Spirit-led ministry) and uncritical charismatic enthusiasm (which may elevate experience above canonical norms). 
 - Critiques both the regulatory over-confidence of some Reformed critics and the experiential absolutism of some renewal advocates.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Frames gift-testing in daily Christian disciplines language (prayerful discernment, pastoral oversight, communal accountability) rather than purely theological proof-texting. 
 - Emphasizes "fitness for edification" as a measuring rod.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Adopted in Reformed contexts as a tempering, pastoral resource that resists polarizing rhetoric. 
 - Valued by pastors and teachers who want a biblical, cautious, and loving approach to charismatic expressions without dismissing the Spirit's present work.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models how to bring exegetical seriousness into devotional formation; useful for preaching series, pastoral seminars, and student formation on pneumatology and church practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Charismata (spiritual gifts):** Presented as God-given capacities for service and edification, to be exercised in love and order. 
- **Pneumatology:** Focus on the Spirit's present work but subordination of extraordinary claims to Scripture and communal testing. 
- **Continuationism:** Acknowledged as a possible reading of Scripture that requires careful testing and ecclesial oversight. 
- **Cessationism:** Critiqued where it forgets pastoral realities; Carson neither embraces dogmatic cessationism nor uncritical continuationism. 
- **Revelation (normative vs. propositional):** Scripture remains norming; new revelatory claims must be weighed against canonical truth. 
- **Prophecy (New Testament sense):** Valued when it builds up the church, is tested, and aligns with Scripture. 
- **Tongues:** Treated cautiously-legitimate within New Testament frames, but often misapplied or misunderstood in modern settings. 
- **Edification (building up):** The primary criterion for acceptable gift use. 
- **Discernment:** Practical skill emphasized for pastors and congregations to differentiate genuine from spurious manifestations. 
- **Church order:** Ecclesial structures and leadership responsibility stressed for regulating gift expression. 
- **Love (agape) as hermeneutic:** Love serves as the interpretive and practical norm for evaluating gifts and ministries. 
- **Exuberant experience vs. scriptural sobriety:** The work calls for balance and pastoral wisdom between the two poles. 
- **Testing (1 Thessalonians 5:21-type testing):** Practical tests recommended-doctrinal conformity, fruit, humility, and accountability.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **pastoral/formation resource** for churches navigating charismatic practices. 
 - As a **mediating polemic**-neither wholesale polemic nor capitulation-used to teach balanced pneumatology and ecclesial prudence. 
 - As an **exegetical model** that links close reading of gift texts to concrete pastoral disciplines and church polity.
