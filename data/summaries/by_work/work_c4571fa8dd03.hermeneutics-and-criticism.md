### TITLE
Hermeneutics and Criticism - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant milieu: post-Kantian critical philosophy, Romantic emphasis on historicity and feeling, rise of historical-critical study of scripture.
 - Schleiermacher frames hermeneutics as a systematic art for modern scholarship: bridging Enlightenment rational critique and lived religious consciousness.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hermeneutics must recover the original meaning of a text by re-establishing the author's linguistic and psychological intent; criticism (textual and historical) secures the text we interpret. For Scripture this reorients authority away from unexamined tradition or literalist readings toward historically informed understanding of revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Two complementary operations:
 - **Grammatical interpretation**: establishing linguistic factors-grammar, philology, genre-that fix sense.
 - **Psychological interpretation**: re-creating the author's mental life and communicative intention (Einfühlung / Verstehen).
 - **Criticism** as prerequisite and check:
 - Textual criticism: establish authentic text.
 - Historical criticism: evaluate authorship, date, provenance.
 - Methodological claim: interpretation is circular but productive - understanding parts and whole reciprocally (the hermeneutic circle) through disciplined historical empathy.
 - Application: treat biblical texts like other authoritative writings, but account for their unique religious force via theological reflection on religious experience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Responds to Kantian epistemology (limits of reason), Romantic hermeneutics (empathy), and contemporary higher critics (historical-critical school).
 - Draws on philology (classical German and classical studies) and Protestant theological tradition.

- **Doctrines treated / theological loci intersected**
 - Revelation and authority (self-attestation): reinterprets authority as bound to historical-cultural articulation and the religious experience that texts evoke.
 - Canon and tradition: critique of uncritical appeals to tradition; emphasis on historical formation and critical evaluation.
 - Inspiration/inerrancy: moves away from simple inerrantist premises toward a nuanced view that accommodates historical contingency.
 - Typology/Christology: locates typological interpretation within authorial intention and later theological reading; constrains but does not eliminate theological fulfillment readings.
 - Indirectly influences readings of Genesis 1-11, eschatology (Revelation 20), covenantal schemas, and anthropological doctrines by privileging historically grounded exegesis.

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's hermeneutics centers theological method on disciplined historical empathy and philological rigor: understand first what the author meant, then reflect theologically on the text's ongoing religious force.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Psychological reconstruction (Einfühlung)** as central to interpretation - empathy with the author is decisive alongside grammar.
 - Systematic linking of **textual criticism** and **interpretive psychology**; neither alone suffices.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects literalist/inerrantist approaches by insisting on historical contingency and authorial intention.
 - Contrasts with earlier dogmatic readings that privilege ecclesial tradition or immediate self-attestation of Scripture without historical inquiry.

- **Innovations**
 - Formal articulation of the modern **hermeneutic circle** (mutual dependence of part and whole).
 - Elevation of **Verstehen** (empathetic understanding) as a methodological norm in theology and the humanities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on modern hermeneutics (Dilthey, Gadamer, Ricoeur); foundational for historical-critical biblical scholarship.
 - Mixed reception in Reformed and confessional circles: adopted as methodological tool by liberal and mainline theologians; critiqued by conservative/confessional theologians for undermining traditional doctrines of inspiration and authority.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides durable methodological disciplines for exegesis: rigorous philology + historically informed theological reflection.
 - Clarifies limits and possibilities for doctrinal claims drawn from texts; remains a pivot for debates over authority, canon, and typology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics** - the art/science of interpretation; for Schleiermacher, a disciplined method combining grammar and psychology.
- **Criticism (Kritik)** - textual and historical evaluation prior to and concurrent with interpretation.
- **Grammatical interpretation** - attention to language, grammar, genre, and philological context.
- **Psychological interpretation (Einfühlung / Verstehen)** - reconstructing the author's thought-world and communicative intention.
- **Hermeneutic circle** - interpretive reciprocity between understanding parts and whole; unavoidable but methodologically manageable.
- **Authorial intention** - normative target of interpretation; yields the text's primary meaning.
- **Textual criticism** - establishing the closest attainable original text as basis for interpretation.
- **Historical criticism** - situating text in its socio-historical matrix (authorship, date, audience).
- **Revelation and authority** - authority located in the text's capacity to evoke religious consciousness once properly understood; challenges naive self-attestation.
- **Inspiration/inerrancy** - treated cautiously: inspiration understood in communicative and religious terms rather than as straightforward factual inerrancy.
- **Canon and tradition** - canon is historically formed and must be critically assessed; tradition informs reception but cannot substitute for textual-critical work.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - permitted when traceable to authorial intention or justified as legitimate theological reading; constrained by Schleiermacher's priority of historical meaning.
- **Verstehen vs. Erklärung** - understanding (empathetic) contrasted with explanation (causal, historical); both are necessary.
- **Application loci**:
 - Used as a **definition source** for modern hermeneutical method (esp. authorial-intent and hermeneutic circle).
 - Employed **polemic** against uncritical appeals to inerrancy and magisterial tradition.
 - Serves as an **exegetical model** for historically grounded readings of Genesis, Revelation, and typological links between OT and NT.
 - Functions as a **conceptual pivot** in discussions on self-attestation, canon formation, and the role of religious experience in biblical authority.
