### TITLE
**Some Pastors and Teachers: Reflecting a Biblical Vision of What Every Minister is Called to Be** 
Sinclair B. Ferguson (Banner of Truth, 2017) 
A retrieval of classic Reformed pastoral theology that sets the pastor-teacher office under a Trinitarian, Christ-centered, Word-and-Spirit paradigm oriented to the church's maturity.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century renewal of confessional Reformed ministry; Banner of Truth milieu; response to evangelical pragmatism and technique-driven leadership.
 - Draws together decades of Ferguson's essays, addresses, and lectures for pastors and students.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church's need is not novelty but ministers who, as pastor-teachers (Eph 4:11), preach Christ from all Scripture in the power of the Spirit through the ordinary means of grace, nurturing holiness, assurance, and maturity.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Biblical foundations**: Ephesians 4; Pastoral Epistles; Colossians 1:28; Acts pattern of Word, prayer, shepherding; Christ and the Spirit as paradigms of ministry.
 - **Historical portraits and retrieval**: Calvin as preacher-theologian; Owen on the Spirit, mortification, communion; Lloyd-Jones on preaching and unction; Puritan cure of souls; Westminster standards and directory of worship.
 - **Doctrinal loci framing ministry**:
 - **Christology**: union with Christ grounds identity, preaching content, and sanctification.
 - **Pneumatology**: ministry is dependent on the Spirit's sovereign unction; rejection of mere technique.
 - **Soteriology**: justification, adoption, sanctification held together; assurance pastorally cultivated by Word and sacrament.
 - **Doctrine of sin**: indwelling sin, mortification and vivification as pastoral agenda.
 - **Covenant theology**: ordinary means in the covenant community; redemptive-historical preaching.
 - **Practices**: expository, Christ-centered preaching; catechesis; pastoral visitation; oversight with elders; sacramental ministry; prayer; suffering and perseverance in ministry.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture; Reformed confessions (esp. Westminster); Calvin, Owen, Puritans, Rutherford; Lloyd-Jones; interaction with contemporary evangelical leadership models and therapeutic paradigms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; Trinity; Christology; Pneumatology; union with Christ; justification, adoption, sanctification, assurance; sin and mortification; church and means of grace; covenant; eschatological maturity.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: a **Trinitarian, Christ-union, Word-and-Spirit ministry** by which pastors present the church mature in Christ through the ordinary means of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Pastor-teacher as a single, teaching-shepherd office** (Eph 4:11) oriented to maturation, not mere management.
 - **Union with Christ** as the organizing reality for preaching, sanctification, and pastoral identity.
 - **Spirit-dependent unction**: authenticity and authority derive from the Spirit, not technique or personality.
 - **Ordinary means of grace** as God's primary instruments: Word, sacraments, prayer in the gathered church.
 - **Assurance and holiness** as pastoral ends joined to adoption and sanctification.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters **pragmatic, CEO, and therapeutic models** of ministry; resists entertainment and technique as substitutes for exposition.
 - Balances sanctification against **legalism and antinomianism** with a grace-driven, Christ-centered pattern.
 - Corrects **enthusiasm** (expectation of extraordinary signs) by highlighting the Spirit's ordinary, covenantal operations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrative retrieval of classic categories (union, mortification, communion with God) for contemporary practice.
 - Clear articulation of **Christ-centered, redemptive-historical exposition** tied to pastoral care, not merely homiletical style.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries, internships, and ministerial fraternals; bridges academic and pastoral audiences.
 - Citational anchor for debates on pastor-theologian, assurance, sanctification, and the ordinary means.
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable template for ministry that unites exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral practice; supplies a canon of tested guides (Calvin, Owen, Lloyd-Jones) for ongoing formation.
