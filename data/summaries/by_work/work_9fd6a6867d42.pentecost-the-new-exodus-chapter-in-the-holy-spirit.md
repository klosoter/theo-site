### TITLE
Pentecost: The New Exodus (chapter) - Sinclair B. Ferguson, from The Holy Spirit

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed-evangelical milieu addressing renewed interest in charismatic gifts and the surge of Pentecostal scholarship.
 - Ferguson writes as a pastoral theologian-theologian seeking to mediate between historical Reformed pneumatology and contemporary charismatic claims.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Pentecost is best understood as the inauguration of a **"New Exodus"** - a corporate, covenantal, and eschatological outpouring of the Spirit that fulfills Old Testament promises and shapes the church's identity and mission.
 - The chapter seeks to correct both reductionist cessationism and individualistic/experiential excesses in some Pentecostal readings.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of OT promise-language (Joel, Ezekiel, Isaiah) that anticipates a Spirit-briefed renewal and return from exile.
 - Luke-Acts reads Pentecost as the fulfillment of the "Promise of the Father" and as the beginning of Israel's restoration in Christ - the new covenant people formed by Spirit.
 - Theologically situates Pentecost within covenant and redemptive-historical continuity:
 - Corporate/eschatological emphasis over private ecstaticization.
 - Pneumatological functions: charismatic gifts, sanctifying presence, enabling mission.
 - Practical implications for church life: Word-saturated, sacramental, disciplined, missionally energized community.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary biblical focus: Joel 2, Ezekiel 36, Isaiah, Luke-Acts, Pauline pneumatology (esp. Romans 8).
 - Engages Reformed traditions (implicit dialogue with Calvin and classical Reformed pneumatology) and contemporary Pentecostal-charismatic interpreters.
 - Uses historical-grammatical exegesis and redemptive-historical framing.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, covenant theology, ecclesiology, eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), Scripture's continuity between Testaments, sacraments and the Word.

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - Pentecost is the decisive covenantal act by which God begins the new Exodus: the Spirit gathers, forms, and sends the people of the new covenant as the sign and agent of Israel's promised restoration and the world's eschatological turnaround.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The term **"New Exodus"** as the central hermeneutical key, prioritizing corporate covenant renewal and mission rather than private spiritual states.
 - Strong stress on continuity: Pentecost is fulfillment of Israel's promises rather than a radical discontinuity or mere duplication of OT phenomena.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic tendencies that read Pentecost primarily as individual experiential empowerment for private benefit.
 - Counters strict cessationists by affirming continuance of Spirit's presence and gifts, but insists on their ecclesial, Word-governed use.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Pentecost within redemptive history as the first act of a new Exodus motif - integrating prophecy-fulfillment, covenant formation, and missionary sending.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a balanced corrective - accessible to pastors and useful in dialogues with Pentecostal scholars.
 - Influenced pastoral pneumatology that is both charismatic-affirming and confessional in order and discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact exegetical-theological model linking OT promise, Lukan fulfillment, and practical ecclesiology; durable for teaching on pneumatology, worship, and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Exodus** - Pentecost as the beginning of Israel's promised deliverance and covenant renewal applied now to the church.
- **Promise of the Father** - Lukan phrase reinterpreted covenantally: Spirit as the gift that fulfills OT promises.
- **Outpouring** - Corporate, public action of God marking covenant inauguration, not merely private experience.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The Spirit's arrival marks the "already" of kingdom fulfillment while awaiting final consummation.
- **Corporate/communal emphasis** - The Spirit forms a people (ekklesia), not only individual subjects.
- **Gifts vs. Fruit** - Distinguishes charismatic gifts (empowerment for mission and edification) from ethical/Christlike fruit of sanctification.
- **Word and sacrament integration** - The Spirit operates primarily through God's appointed means (preaching, baptism, Lord's Supper) in covenant life.
- **Mission - missio Dei** - Spirit sending equips the church for witness and restoration consistent with new Exodus motif.
- **Continuity-Discontinuity** - Pentecost as continuity with OT promises and discontinuity in the new covenant realization.
- **Regeneration vs. Filling** - Clarifies theological difference: regeneration (new birth) and filling (empowerment for ministry) within covenant life.
- **Joel-Ezekiel fulfillment** - Uses these prophets as hermeneutical keys for understanding Acts 2.
- **Trinitarian sending** - Emphasizes the Spirit's role within the Trinity's economic mission.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed pneumatology stressing covenantal, corporate dimensions.
 - As a **polemic** resource against both cessationist reductionism and unregulated charismatic individualism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts in continuity with the OT prophetic corpus and for shaping ecclesiology and mission strategy.
