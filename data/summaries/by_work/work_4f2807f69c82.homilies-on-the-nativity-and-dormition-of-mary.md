### TITLE
Homilies on the Nativity and Dormition of Mary - John of Damascus

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 7th / early 8th century Byzantine (John of Damascus, c. 675-749). Post‑Chalcedonian theological milieu shaped by Ephesus (431) and Chalcedon (451) debates and by ongoing controversies over Christology and Marian titles.
 - Homiletic/liturgical genre: sermons delivered and preserved for feast days (Nativity of the Theotokos; Dormition), mixing exegesis, dogmatic argument, and devotional exhortation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the title *Theotokos* and the Dormition/Assumption tradition by grounding Marian honor in the hypostatic union: because Mary bore the Person of the Word, properties of the incarnate Lord may be spoken of in relation to her - properly understood through the communicatio idiomatum.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of hypostatic union (one Person, two natures) as the hermeneutical key.
 - Application: attributes that belong to the Person of the Logos are legitimately ascribed to Mary in virtue of her relationship to that Person (e.g., mother of the Word - "Mother of God").
 - Guard against error: maintain that properties of the divine nature are not confused with the human nature (no mingling or conversion of natures).
 - Liturgical and soteriological move: Marian honor fosters right worship of Christ and points to salvation wrought in the incarnate Word.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Canonical Scripture (Gospels, especially Luke); patristic authorities (Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, earlier Marian homilies); ecumenical councils (notably Ephesus and Chalcedon).
 - Polemical interlocutors implicit: Nestorian denial of Theotokos; Monophysite/Apollinarian overemphasis on the divine to the detriment of true humanity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, one Person), Mariology (Theotokos, Dormition/Assumption, perpetual virginity as presupposed), soteriology (incarnation as redemption), sacramental and liturgical implications (veneration, doxology).
- **Closing line**
 - John centers Marian doctrine on the person of the Incarnate Word: because the Logos personally unites divine and human natures, Marian titles and feast‑observances are theologically warranted via a disciplined use of the communicatio idiomatum.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp insistence that Marian honor derives not from ontological divinization of Mary but from her relation to the divine Person; this protects both Marian devotion and Chalcedonian precision.
 - Homiletic framing: doctrinal argument proceeds alongside pastoral liturgical exhortation - theology that feeds prayer and feast.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Nestorian tendencies by emphasizing personal unity (hence Theotokos is necessary and orthodox).
 - Corrects Monophysite/Apollinarian tendencies by insisting on the full humanity of Christ and on the non‑confusion of natures.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of communicatio idiomatum in Mariological argument: he operationalizes how predicates transfer from the incarnate Person to related human agents (Mary) without collapsing natures.
 - Clarifies relational predicates (motherhood of the Person) vs. ontological attributions (divinity of Mary).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Eastern Orthodox Mariology and liturgical theology; his homilies are read in feasts and used as doctrinal exemplars.
 - Less direct influence in Reformed traditions, though studied for his Christological articulations; often critiqued by Reformed theologians when used to support Marian dogmas beyond what they accept.
- **Enduring value**
 - A compact model for integrating Christology and Mariology with pastoral devotion; valuable for courses on patristic Christology, definitions of Theotokos, and pre‑modern homiletic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - John's central technical move: predicates of the incarnate Person may be ascribed to associated agents (e.g., Mary) insofar as they relate to the one hypostatic Subject without confusing natures.
- **Theotokos (Mother of God)**
 - Defended as a necessary relational predicate: Mary bore the Person who is God; term safeguards personal unity against Nestorian partition.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - One Person (the Logos) in two unconfused natures; the hermeneutical basis for Marian attributions.
- **Physis / Hypostasis distinction**
 - John preserves the Chalcedonian language: two physis (natures) in one hypostasis (person).
- **Dormition / Assumption**
 - Treats Mary's death (Dormition) and bodily exaltation (Assumption) as the fitting liturgical and soteriological outcome of bearing the Incarnate Lord.
- **Perpetual virginity**
 - Implicitly affirmed in patristic homiletic tradition as consonant with Mary's singular role; used devotionally more than as argumentative proof.
- **Properties (idiomata)**
 - Attributes proper to each nature; John explains how idiomata may be predicated of the person without ontological transfer.
- **Relational predicates**
 - Emphasizes that titles like "mother of God" are relational to the Person of Christ, not ontological claims about Mary's nature.
- **Union without confusion**
 - Recurrent formula: participation in personhood without nature‑commingling.
- **Liturgical typology**
 - Uses feast texts and scriptural typology to ground doctrinal points pastorally.
- **The Logos**
 - Central subject: the Person through whom communicative predicates and soteriology are understood.
- **Soteriology via Incarnation**
 - Incarnation as decisive for human redemption and for honoring Mary as instrument and mother of the Redeemer.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Theotokos and practical application of communicatio idiomatum.
- As **polemic** against Nestorian and Monophysite misreadings of person/nature distinctions.
- As an **exegetical/homiletic model** for integrating doctrine, liturgy, and pastoral exhortation.
