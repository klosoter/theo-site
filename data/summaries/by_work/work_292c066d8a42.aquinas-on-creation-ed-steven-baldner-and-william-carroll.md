### TITLE
Aquinas on Creation (ed. Steven Baldner and William Carroll) - selections of Thomas Aquinas on Genesis, creatio, and the "Days of Creation"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Thirteenth-century Scholasticism; Dominican intellectual milieu; synthesis of Augustinian Scriptural exegesis and Aristotelian metaphysics. The modern edition gathers Aquinas's key treatments (Summa Theologiae, Quaestiones Disputatae, commentaries on Genesis and Sentences) with commentary and translation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to affirm creatio ex nihilo, the goodness and order of created being, and the Scriptural "six days" without compromising God's simplicity, eternity, and the intelligibility of cosmology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - God is the sole *ipsum esse* (act of being); creation is a free act bringing finite being into existence out of nothing.
 - Aquinas distinguishes orders: **order of reasons (ordo rationis)** vs **order of being (ordo essendi)** to account for Genesis chronology and philosophical accounts of being.
 - The six days can be read in several senses (literal temporal, logical, or pedagogical) - Genesis accommodates human language and cognition.
 - God is first cause; creatures are received causes with real natures and secondary causal powers; creation is simultaneous in divine will yet diversified temporally by creaturely natures and secondary causation.
 - Creation entails continual conservation: creatures depend moment-to-moment on God for existence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine (exegetical method), Aristotle (metaphysical categories), Peter Lombard, medieval commentators; engages literalist readings and natural philosophers of his day.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (creatio ex nihilo), divine simplicity, providence and conservation, providential ordering, Trinity as agent in creation (creatio per Verbum), revelation and biblical exegesis (Genesis), relationship of philosophy to theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas' theological center of gravity: creation is the gratuitous, intelligible manifesting of God's simple will - the "days" of Genesis are ordered to human apprehension and to the ontological gradation of creatures rather than a naive chronology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic integration of Aristotelian causality with Christian doctrine: God as first cause whose act of creation is compatible with temporal sequencing without implying change in God.
 - Precision about levels of order: Aquinas keeps distinct the rational/logical order of narration and the metaphysical order of being.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Softens literalist readings by insisting on genre, accommodation, and the pedagogical aim of Scripture (following Augustine) while adding metaphysical clarity absent from earlier exegesis.
 - Contrasts with pure Platonic emanation: creation is contingent, not necessary; creatures do not participate being as emanations but receive being freely from God.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of ordo rationis vs ordo essendi to resolve exegetical-philosophical tensions.
 - Precise account of "days" as sensible measures applied to higher metaphysical truths (dies as modes of narration or as stages of manifestation).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for medieval and Catholic teaching on creation; central to Neo-Thomist revival and the Catholic Church's engagement with science and biblical criticism.
 - Protestant reception mixed: some adopt Thomistic metaphysics for doctrine of God and creation; others (early Reformers) resisted scholastic method while later Reformed scholastics engaged Thomistic categories selectively.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of theological method: philosophical rigor constraining exegesis; durable resources for dialogue between Scripture, metaphysics, and natural science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creatio ex nihilo** - God brings finite being into existence without preexistent matter; the act is gratuitous.
- **Divine simplicity** - God is not composite; His will is identical with His intellect and power, which shapes how divine action relates to time.
- **First cause / secondary causes** - God is primary cause; creatures possess real causal efficacy but depend on God for their being.
- **Order of reasons (ordo rationis)** - the logical or narrative ordering (how God chooses to disclose events in Scripture).
- **Order of being (ordo essendi)** - the metaphysical ordering of creatures according to participation in being.
- **Accommodation** - Scripture speaks in human terms (including "days") to convey truths suited to our capacity.
- **Dies (the "Days" of Creation)** - can denote literal temporal periods, logical stages, or pedagogical categories; Aquinas favors a polyvalent, non-naive literalism.
- **Conservation (sustinere)** - continual divine sustaining of created existence; creation is not a past act only but an ongoing dependent relation.
- **Creatures as received being** - creatures are not self-explanatory; their existence is received from God and intelligible by participation.
- **Creatio per Verbum (creation through the Word)** - the Son/Word as instrumental principle in creation without dividing the divine will.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - language about God and creatures is analogous, preventing equivocation and univocity.
- **Pedagogical revelation** - Scripture's narrative forms teach theological truths rather than offer scientific accounts.
- **Temporal manifestation vs eternal causation** - God's causation is eternal though its effects manifest within temporal sequences.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for Catholic doctrine on creatio ex nihilo, conservation, and the role of the Word in creation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis non-literally while preserving theological commitments (useful in theological-biblical integration).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in natural theology and philosophy of creation: supplies metaphysical tools (causation, order distinctions) for debates with modern science and literalist hermeneutics.
