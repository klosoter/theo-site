### TITLE
Systematic Theology (2015) - Anthony C. Thiselton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2015 by Oxford University Press; mature work from a British evangelical scholar steeped in continental and analytic philosophy, historical-critical exegesis, and contemporary systematic theology.
 - Moves within an ecumenical, postliberal-evangelical milieu that seeks dialogue between biblical scholarship, philosophical theology, and constructive doctrine.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be both exegetically responsible and philosophically robust: Christian doctrine is best understood as a hermeneutically informed, historically attentive, and practically enacted account of salvation-history culminating in the resurrection and new creation.
 - Addresses how resurrection and new-creation language secures continuity between Christ's bodily vindication and the future transformation of creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Integrated, single-volume systematic that proceeds from Scripture and tradition through doctrine to ethics and eschatology.
 - Major moves on eschatology/resurrection:
 - Reaffirms bodily, historical resurrection as central to soteriology and Christian hope.
 - Frames resurrection within **inaugurated eschatology**: already/not-yet transformation, where Christ's resurrection initiates new creation but awaits cosmic fulfillment.
 - Emphasizes participation in Christ (union with Christ) and Spirit-empowered transformation as the theological mechanics linking individual resurrection and creation-wide renewal.
 - Methodological hallmark: sustained interplay of exegetical detail (esp. Pauline corpus), philosophical clarity, and systematic retrieval.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Close engagement with Paul (esp. 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 8), New Testament scholarship (including N. T. Wright), Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, and contemporary analytic and continental voices.
 - Dialogues with modern critics of bodily eschatology and with ecological/creation-care theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, hermeneutics, Christology, Trinity, Spirit, soteriology, anthropology, ecclesiology, sacrament, eschatology (resurrection and new creation central).
 - Cross-locus emphasis on ethics and public theology deriving from eschatological hope.

- **Closing line**
 - Thiselton locates Christian theology's center of gravity in the risen Christ whose bodily resurrection inaugurates a Spirit-powered new creation that unites personal vindication with cosmic renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Combines rigorous hermeneutical theory with constructive doctrinal synthesis; insists on **hermeneutical realism**-texts signify real historical and theological claims, not merely narratives.
 - Strong stress on bodily continuity/discontinuity: a transformed bodily ontology rather than dematerialized immortality.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely spiritualizing or purely futurist readings of resurrection (both classical Greek dualism and reductionist futurism).
 - Engages and refines N. T. Wright's emphasis on new creation by insisting on precise metaphysical and soteriological mechanisms (participation, Spirit, sacramental economy).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Synthesizes language of **participation** (union with Christ) with **new creation** discourse to articulate how individual resurrection is both personal and corporate/cosmic.
 - Deploys dialogical hermeneutics to bridge historical-critical exegesis and doctrinal formulation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a contemporary single-volume systematic; valued in evangelical and broader academic contexts for balance of exegesis and constructive theology.
 - Influential for discussions on embodied eschatology, sacramental participation in resurrection, and eco-eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating biblical scholarship, philosophy, and doctrine; particularly valuable for courses and research on resurrection, eschatology, and the theological implications for ethics and creation care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection**
 - Central historic event and eschatological hinge; bodily vindication of Christ that grounds believer's hope in bodily transformation.

- **New creation**
 - Cosmic renewal inaugurated by Christ's resurrection; ultimate horizon for redemption of persons and cosmos.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The already/not-yet paradigm Thiselton uses to account for present Spirit-empowered transformation and future consummation.

- **Participation (union with Christ)**
 - Mechanism explaining how believers share in Christ's death and resurrection; links personal soteriology to corporate/new-creation reality.

- **Body / corporeality (soma)**
 - Emphasis on transformed, continuous yet new bodily existence; counters soul-only immortality.

- **Spirit (pneumatology)**
 - Agent of present renewal and pledge of future bodily resurrection and creation-wide reconciliation.

- **Continuity and discontinuity**
 - Analytical category for explaining what is preserved/transformed in resurrection and new creation (identity vs. radical novelty).

- **Pauline exegesis (1 Cor 15; Rom 8)**
 - Primary scriptural loci; Thiselton reads these texts as theological and metaphysical foundations for resurrection and cosmic hope.

- **Hermeneutical realism**
 - Methodological claim that theological interpretation must seek the referential, historical-theological truth of biblical claims.

- **Sacramental participation**
 - Eucharist and baptism as present signs/means of participation in Christ's death and resurrection and anticipations of new creation.

- **Eschatological hope**
 - Ethical and communal driver: belief in resurrection shapes Christian ethics, social justice, and environmental responsibility.

- **Cosmic reconciliation**
 - The scope of redemption extended beyond souls to creation; grounds ecological theology.

- **Parousia / consummation**
 - Final event that completes the inaugurated new-creation process.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for embodied resurrection and new-creation language in contemporary theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline treatment of resurrection (close textual work feeding systematic claims).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in linking soteriology, pneumatology, sacrament, and ecological ethics around the theme of new creation.
