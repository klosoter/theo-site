### TITLE
The Atonement: In Its Relations to the Covenant, the Priesthood, the Intercession of Our Lord - Hugh Martin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-century Scottish Reformed milieu (Hugh Martin, a Scottish Presbyterian theologian). Written within an era of robust Reformed covenant theology and reaction against emerging liberal and purely ethical readings of Christ's work. Engages patristic, Puritan, and Reformation resources with careful exegetical attention to Hebrews.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The atonement must be understood primarily within the framework of covenantal relations and as intrinsically priestly - not merely a moral example or governmental expedient. Christ's sacrificial death is covenantal satisfaction effected by the Mediator who continues his work by perpetual intercession.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: Hebrew sacrificial, priestly imagery and NT texts (especially Hebrews) demonstrate Christ's priesthood and ongoing intercession.
 - Covenant framework: Distinguishes covenant of redemption and covenant of grace; atonement is the fulfillment of covenant obligations by the surety (Christ).
 - Priestly office and function: Christ as priest effects expiation, propitiation, and reconciliation; his intercession secures application and persistence of benefits.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: Assurance, the nature of justification, and sacramental participation flow from a covenantal-priestly reading.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy reliance on Reformation and Puritan theologians (Calvin, John Owen and other Puritans), Hebrews exegesis, and polemical engagement with moral influence and governmental theories of atonement. Implicit contrast with Romanist sacerdotalism on one hand and Socinian/Unitarian denials on the other.
- **Doctrines treated:** Atonement, covenant theology (covenant of redemption / covenant of grace), Christology (office and person), priesthood (continuing intercession), justification (imputation and satisfaction), sacramentology (as related to covenant signs), and pastoral assurance.
- **Closing line:** Martin insists that the atonement is covenantal satisfaction executed and perpetuated by the Mediator's priesthood and intercession - union with Christ as surety is the key to understanding both the accomplishment and application of redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong integration of covenantal categories with priestly function: atonement is read primarily as covenantal suretyship enacted through priestly sacrifice and continued by intercession.
 - A sustained insistence on the *continuing* priestly activity of Christ (intercession) as essential to applied redemption and believer assurance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Affirms penal-satisfaction/substitutionary motifs against moral-influence and purely governmental accounts.
 - Rejects Roman Catholic notions of sacerdotal repetition while defending a non-Romish notion of an ongoing, yet unique, high-priestly mediation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasis on relational legal language (surety, covenant obligation) fused with priestly and sacrificial language (expiation, intercession) to avoid bifurcating accomplishment and application.
 - Readiness to employ the triplex munus (Munus Triplex) framework to situate priesthood within Christ's unified offices.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly regarded within conservative Scottish Presbyterian and broader Reformed circles as a clear, pastorally sensitive defense of covenantal, substitutionary atonement; used against liberal reinterpretations and as a resource in preaching and doctrinal instruction.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Exemplary integration of exegetical care, covenantal theology, and pastoral concern; especially useful for courses on soteriology, Hebrews, and the doctrine of Christ's offices.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement:** The single salvific act by which Christ satisfies divine justice; understood as covenantal satisfaction accomplished by the Mediator.
- **Covenant of Redemption / Covenant of Grace:** Distinguishes intratrinitarian agreement to redeem (redemption) and the covenantal arrangement to apply salvation to elect sinners (grace).
- **Priesthood (Christ's priesthood):** Central category - Christ as eternal high priest whose sacrifice is once-for-all and whose intercession is ongoing.
- **Intercession:** The continuing, efficacious mediatorial activity of Christ applying and preserving covenant benefits for believers.
- **Substitution / Satisfaction:** Penal and representative language: Christ bears the penalty due to sinners, satisfying divine justice as their surety.
- **Expiation / Propitiation:** Removal of guilt and appeasement of divine holiness; Martin ties these to covenantal and priestly vocabulary.
- **Surety:** Legal/relational term for Christ as representative who binds himself to fulfil covenant obligations on behalf of the elect.
- **Munus Triplex (tripartite office):** Christ's offices (prophet, priest, king) used diagnostically; Martin highlights the priestly role without divorcing it from the prophetic and kingly functions.
- **Imputation:** The forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers and of their sin to Christ within covenantal accounting.
- **Finished work vs. continuing application:** Martin affirms the finished nature of Christ's sacrificial work and its ongoing application by priestly intercession - both necessary.
- **Sacramental connection:** Sacraments are covenant signs that point to and seal the priestly-covenantal benefits.
- **Representative mediation:** Emphasis on federal headship and legal representation in covenantal structure.
- **Propitiatory sacrifice:** Christ's death as satisfying divine wrath within the covenantal legal order.
- **Reconciliation:** The relational restoration between God and sinners wrought by Christ's atoning priesthood.

- **Typical uses of the work across loci:**
 - Definition source: clear exposition of covenantal, substitutionary atonement and Christ's priesthood.
 - Polemic: used to rebut moral-influence, governmental, and liberal accounts of atonement.
 - Exegetical model: a Hebraic and covenantal reading of Hebrews and Pauline soteriology that informs preaching and doctrinal instruction.
