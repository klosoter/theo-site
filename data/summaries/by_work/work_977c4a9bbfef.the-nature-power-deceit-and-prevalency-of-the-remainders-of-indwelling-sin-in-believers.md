### TITLE
**John Owen - The Nature, Power, Deceit, and Prevalency of the Remainders of Indwelling Sin in Believers**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century England (published 1656); Owen writing during the English Commonwealth, amid Puritan scholasticism and pastoral concern for personal and ecclesial holiness.
 - Movement: Reformed/Puritan pastoral theology with scholastic method, integrating pastoral exhortation, biblical exegesis, and philosophical psychology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Believers possess a persistent, active remainder of indwelling sin that is real, powerful, deceptive, and frequently prevailing; yet this remainder does not annul justification or final perseverance.
 - The problem addressed: how to account the believer's continuing sinfulness without compromising the assurance of salvation or the doctrine of union with Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: distinguishes "indwelling sin" (inward principle) from actual sins (acts) and from original corruption as in non-regenerate persons.
 - Analysis of properties: Owen characterizes the remainder in believers by its nature (corruptive principle), operations (motions, temptations, prevalency), deceit (self-justification, hypocrisy), and degrees (more or less active).
 - Pastoral implications: prescribes means for mortification (watchfulness, Spirit-mediated mortification, use of Word, prayer, church discipline) and sets boundaries for assurance (dependence on Christ, not on felt mortification).
 - Final sections: defends perseverance and communion with the church despite remaining corruption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture extensively (Pauline passages: Romans, Galatians; particularly Romans 7 and 8).
 - Interlocutors: contemporary Puritans and Arminian critics implicitly; draws on Augustine and Reformed scholastics while correcting perceived errors (e.g., antinomian tendencies).
 - Replies to pastoral skeptics who interpret remaining sin as evidence of non-regeneration.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (nature and origin), justification, sanctification (mortification and vivification), assurance, union with Christ, ecclesiology as it relates to church membership and discipline.

- **Closing line**
 - Owen locates the theological center in the paradox: believers are simultaneously justified and yet still mortally engaged in spiritual warfare with an inward, deceitful sin that must be mortified by Spirit and means without undermining assurance of redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Psychological subtlety: sharp analysis of sin's deceitfulness and internal motions anticipating later Reformed pastoral psychology.
 - Pastoral balance: insists on vigorous mortification while safeguarding assurance grounded in Christ's work, not in experiential perfection.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects antinomian complacency by affirming real indwelling sin that obliges moral effort.
 - Counters legalism by denying that degree of mortification is the basis of justification or final salvation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise taxonomy: separates indwelling sin (principle), remaining corruption (remainders), actual sins (acts), habitual sins - giving tools still used in later sanctification debates.
 - Emphasizes the "deceit" and "prevalency" as theological-psychological categories rather than mere moral descriptions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed pastoral theology and Puritan studies; became a standard text on sanctification and assurance.
 - Adopted by later Reformed writers and evangelicals for its pastoral usefulness; criticized by some for juridical semantics that risked introspection.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined framework for pastoral care, spiritual direction, and systematic theology on sanctification and assurance.
 - Models how to keep Christocentric assurance while demanding ethical seriousness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Indwelling Sin** - the corrupt principle remaining in believers after regeneration; intrinsic but not identical to original sin in the unregenerate.
- **Remains / Remainders of Corruption** - residual inclination to sin that resists mortification; Owen's focus term.
- **Mortification** - Spirit-enabled putting to death of sin by means (Word, prayer, mortification practices).
- **Deceit (of sin)** - sin's capacity to disguise itself as virtue or necessity; central to Owen's pastoral warnings.
- **Prevalency** - the power and frequency with which remaining sin exerts influence over affections and actions.
- **Actual Sins vs. Principle** - distinction between sinful acts and the indwelling corrupt nature; used to defend justification.
- **Assurance** - justified confidence rooted in Christ's work; Owen argues assurance must not be equated with perfect mortification.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological grounding of believer's justified status despite remaining sin.
- **Perseverance** - Owen ties mortification and means to perseverance without making them the basis of salvation.
- **Pastoral Means** - Word, sacraments, prayer, vigilance, church discipline as instruments for mortification.
- **Hypocrisy** - false appearance of holiness; Owen warns believers of deceitful justification by works.
- **Sanctification** - progressive work of the Spirit contrasted with instantaneous justification.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: standard reference for the theological anatomy of indwelling sin and sanctification.
 - Polemic and pastoral model: used against antinomian and legalist positions, and as a manual for pastoral care and spiritual direction.
 - Exegetical pivot: Owen's reading of Romans 7/8 and Pauline anthropology remains a touchstone for Reformed exegesis on sin and assurance.
