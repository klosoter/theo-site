### TITLE
**"Traducianism or Creationism?" - Anthony A. Hoekema, Baker's Dictionary of Theology (1960)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century evangelical/Reformed reference work; concise dictionary-article format aimed at pastors, students, and general theological readership.
 - Sits within ongoing post-Reformation debates about human origin, original sin, and the relation of body and soul in Protestant theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The article frames the central question: **Are human souls propagated from parents (traducianism) or immediately created by God at conception (creationism)?** Hoekema defines both positions, weighs objections, and judges which best accounts for Scripture, theology, and pastoral concerns.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and historical survey: succinct exposition of traducianism and creationism and key historical advocates.
 - Biblical and theological criteria: criteria adduced include the transmission of sin, biblical texts on human origin and descent, God's role as creator, and the unity of the human person.
 - Philosophical/metaphysical assessment: simplicity of soul, problem of multiplicity of souls if created ex nihilo each time, and how each view handles the origin of the soul's immaterial aspect.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: focus on how the views account for the propagation of original sin and human responsibility.
 - Conclusion: Hoekema favors the explanatory power of traducianism while noting unresolved difficulties and encouraging humility given Scriptural ambiguity.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical figures summarized: patristic, medieval (e.g., Augustine, Aquinas), Reformation (Luther, Calvin), and modern theologians on both sides.
 - Scriptural texts considered implicitly or explicitly: Genesis genealogies/themes, Romans 5, Psalm 51, passages bearing on human descent and sin.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology** (origin of the soul, unity of person)
 - **Original sin / transmission of sin**
 - Secondary engagement with **divine creation**, providence, and implications for Christology (e.g., the human nature of Christ as exception)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Hoekema frames the debate as essentially about **how to account theologically for the real transmission of sin and human continuity**; he leans toward traducianism as the more coherent fit with Reformed concerns about inherited sin, while admitting that Scripture does not yield an airtight proof and that either position must reckon with serious theological costs.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Concentrates attention on the **soteriological and anthropological consequences** of each view rather than merely metaphysical niceties; treats the issue as central to doctrines of sin and grace.
 - Emphasizes pastoral implications (assurance, culpability, and the spiritual formation of infants).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters creationist appeals to divine simplicity and immediate creation with pragmatic theological priorities: transmission of sin and ontological continuity.
 - Distinguishes his assessment from purely scholastic debates by using Scriptural and pastoral criteria, not only metaphysical argumentation.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - No radical novelties; the article reframes older arguments to highlight **doctrinal coherence with Reformed teachings on original sin** and human solidarity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Used widely as a clear, readable summary in Reformed and evangelical circles; cited in later Reformed anthropological treatments for its balanced yet pointed lean toward traducianism.
 - Functioned pedagogically: common go-to entry for seminarians introducing the subject.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a compact, theologically oriented survey that connects abstract metaphysical claims to practical doctrinal consequences; helpful model of how to weigh historical options responsibly when Scripture is not explicit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Traducianism** - view that souls (and thus human persons) are generated by parental propagation; explains continuity of sin and personal identity.
- **Creationism (of the soul)** - view that God creates each soul immediately (often at conception); emphasizes divine agency and particular creation.
- **Original sin** - theological category central to the debate; traducianism is usually held to explain its transmission more naturally.
- **Imago Dei** - used as a criterion: any account of soul-origin must preserve the dignity and divine image of humans.
- **Psychophysical unity** - the claim that human personhood is a unity of body and soul; Hoekema stresses this unity in evaluating models.
- **Transmission (of sin)** - how depravity passes to offspring; a decisive theological hinge for Hoekema.
- **Divine creation / creatio ex nihilo** - the doctrine that God creates; creationism emphasizes immediate exercise of this act for each soul.
- **Metaphysical simplicity** - philosophical concern invoked by creationists about the immaterial soul's simplicity and how it could be generated.
- **Pastoral implications** - how each view affects baptism, infant salvation, pastoral care, and moral responsibility.
- **Scriptural ambiguity** - Hoekema notes that Scripture does not explicitly adjudicate the mechanism, which mandates theological humility.
- **Phenomenology of descent** - descriptive attention to genealogies and language of "born of" vs. "created" in Scripture.
- **Soteriological coherence** - measuring views by their fit with doctrines of sin, Christ's atonement, and regeneration.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: concise, reliable summaries of both positions for textbooks and lectures.
 - As a **polemic catalyst**: cited by Reformed writers who argue for traducianism on grounds of original sin.
 - As an **exegetical-modeling resource**: model for connecting biblical texts to doctrinal judgment where neither is explicit.
