### TITLE
The Providence of God (Anonymous)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Anonymous tract circulating in orthodox Protestant and wider confessional circles from the Reformation to modern conservative seminars; frequently reprinted in anthologies on providence and theodicy. Functions as a concise handbook for ministers and students rather than a systematic monograph.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Providence is the comprehensive, continuous governance of God by which he foreknows, wills, sustains, permits, and governs all events so that divine sovereignty and creaturely responsibility are both real and intelligible; the doctrine must answer the problem of evil, ground trust, and preserve Scriptural authority about God's knowledge and action.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and scriptural warrant for providence (bibliological foundation).
 - Exposition of God's **foreknowledge** and relation to time: God knows all outcomes without being the author of moral evil.
 - Mechanics of governance: **preservation**, **concurrence**, and **permission** as distinct moments in providential activity.
 - Theodicy: permitted evil as instrumentally ordered to greater goods and as compatible with divine justice.
 - Pastoral implications: providence as ground for trust, prayer, and evangelism; role of **common** and **preparatory grace** in salvation history.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy appeal to Scripture (Psalms, Romans 8, Acts 17), classical authorities (Augustine, Calvin), medieval synthesis (Aquinas), and modern interlocutors (Molinists, Arminians, Open Theists, Plantinga-style free will defenses). Treats Molinism and Open Theism as prominent rivals.
- **Doctrines treated:** Providence, predestination, foreknowledge, divine attributes (absolute and relative), sin and theodicy, general revelation and bibliology, common/preparatory grace, basic soteriology (preparatory grace leading to effectual calling).
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** Providence, rightly conceived, is the single theological hinge that preserves God's sovereignty, secures moral accountability, and vindicates hope amid evil by showing that God orders even adverse events toward his faithful purposes.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses a tripartite technical scheme: **preservation (being), concurrence (action), permission (moral allowance)** - each carefully distinguished to avoid determinism and moral blame.
 - Stresses **relative attributes** (how God's attributes are described in relation to creatures) alongside absolute attributes to preserve condescension without diminishing deity.
 - Elevates **preparatory grace** as a providential rubric: non-saving, common graces that prepare hearts and contexts for the gospel reception.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects deterministic readings of classic Calvinism by insisting on genuine contingency in secondary causes.
 - Challenges Open Theism's construal of divine knowledge as temporally limited, arguing instead for a robust Scriptural case for exhaustive foreknowledge that nonetheless permits genuine creature freedom.
 - Critiques Molinist reliance on middle knowledge as explanatorily excessive for pastoral theology; favors simpler concurrence model for preaching and consolation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Coining of a pragmatic rubric sometimes called the **"concurrent-permissive schema"** - practical tool for pastors to explain providence in pastoral care.
 - Framing of providence as an **epistemic and moral economy**: God condescends epistemically (withholds certain realities) to enable human responsibility while remaining fully sovereign.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and confessional Protestant circles as a concise classroom text and sermon source on providence.
 - Adopted in bibliology modules for demonstrating how Scripture grounds doctrines of God's governance.
- **Enduring value:** Clear, defensible distinctions useful for pastors, teachers, and apologists who must navigate theodicy, divine attributes, and pastoral consolation without technical excess.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence:** God's ongoing governance; includes preservation, concurrence, and permission.
- **Preservation:** God sustaining the existence of creatures moment by moment.
- **Concurrence:** Divine action that cooperates with secondary causes without destroying their causal agency.
- **Permission (Permissive Will):** God's allowance of moral evil for ordained ends without endorsing the evil morally.
- **Foreknowledge:** God's exhaustive knowledge of future contingent events; maintained as compatible with human freedom.
 - contrasted with **middle knowledge** (Molinism) and **Open Theism** positions discussed as alternatives.
- **Absolute attributes:** Divine perfections considered in themselves (immutability, aseity).
- **Relative attributes:** How divine attributes are expressed in relation to creatures (mercy, condescension); used to preserve pastoral language.
- **Theodicy:** Defense of God's justice in permitting evil; appeals to greater goods, eschatological rectification, and covenantal accountability.
- **Divine condescension:** God's voluntary self-limitation in revelation and providential dealings to enable creaturely response.
- **Common grace:** Non-saving provisions that restrain sin and prepare for gospel reception.
- **Preparatory grace:** Specific providential acts that arrange circumstances for evangelism and conversion.
- **Epistemology of God-knowledge:** How humans can know providence-Scripture as primary and general revelation as secondary warrant.
- **Concurrence-Permissive Schema:** Practical explanatory framework for pastors and teachers emphasizing divine action plus moral permission.
- **Pastoral theodicy:** Use of providence doctrine to comfort sufferers and maintain trust in God's justice.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** in Theology Proper courses for delineating providence terms.
 - As a **polemic** against Open Theism and rigid determinism in contemporary debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching texts on divine sovereignty (e.g., Joseph, Job, Romans 8).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting bibliology and soteriology via the doctrines of common/preparatory grace.
