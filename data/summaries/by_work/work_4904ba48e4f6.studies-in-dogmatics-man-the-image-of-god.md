### TITLE
**G. C. Berkouwer - Studies in Dogmatics: Man: The Image of God**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed dogmatics (Studies in Dogmatics series, 1950s). Berkouwer writes from a Dutch Reformed context influenced by neo-Calvinist and Barthian currents, engaging postwar theological and philosophical anthropology and the encounter of Scripture with modern science.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What does it mean for human beings to be created in the image of God (imago Dei), and how is that image wounded by sin and restored in Christ? Berkouwer aims to locate the imago Dei within a canonical, Christ-centered dogmatic structure rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of biblical witness to the image (Genesis 1-2, and the New Testament Christological fulfillment).
 - Critical appraisal of philosophical and theological models (substantive, relational, functional accounts).
 - Diagnosis of the image's corruption in the Fall and the consequences for human freedom, sin, and vocation.
 - Christological restoration: the image's eschatological fulfillment in Christ and the Spirit's renewing work in the church.
 - Pastoral-ethical implications for human dignity, vocation, and social life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Biblical text (Genesis, Pauline and Johannine Christology), Augustine, Calvin, Bavinck, Barth, contemporary Protestant and Roman Catholic commentators, and modern philosophical anthropology. Berkouwer also dialogues with issues raised by contemporary science and hermeneutical questions about the **Days Of Creation** and the relation of Genesis 1-11 to scientific accounts (see Science And Scripture, Genesis 1 11).
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, imago Dei, original righteousness, sin and depravity, human freedom, redemption and sanctification, Christology (Christ as true image), eschatology (eschatological restoration), revelation and Scripture's authority.
- **Closing line:** Berkouwer centers the doctrine of the image of God in a canonical-Christological horizon: the human person is defined by relational vocation and responsible representation, wounded by sin but renewed in Christ toward eschatological consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong anti-metaphysical posture: resists reduction of imago Dei to a fixed metaphysical "substance"; prefers a dogmatic, relational, and Christologically mediated understanding.
 - Emphasis on vocation and representation: human dignity is rooted in appointed responsibility toward God, creation, and neighbor.
 - Stress on the **present-but-not-yet** character of the restored image-salvation restores function and relation progressively, consummated in eschaton.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects overly abstract "substantive" models (rationality, will, soul as static property) by highlighting relational and functional aspects.
 - Offers a tempered response to strict Barthian rejection of traditional anthropology by preserving biblical categories while avoiding speculative metaphysics.
 - Counters literalistic or concordist readings of Genesis (relevant to **Days Of Creation**) that subordinate theological meaning to scientific chronology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts imago Dei as a dynamic, relational-dogmatic category rather than a mere ontological predicate.
 - Uses Christology as hermeneutical key: Christ as the normative and restorative image.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in postwar Reformed scholarship; regarded as a balanced, pastoral, and exegetically attentive treatment.
 - Adopted by many English-speaking Reformed theologians as a standard modern dogmatic treatment; critiqued by some conservative literalists and by philosophical anthropologists seeking robust metaphysical claims.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a sustained model for integrating biblical exegesis, dogmatic method, and pastoral ethics; valuable for teaching on anthropology, sin, and Christological restoration, and for navigating Genesis-science questions without capitulation to either naive literalism or reductive scientism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** Central category; relational, vocational, and Christologically realized.
- **Substantive view:** Traditional notion that the image is an intrinsic property (intellect, will); Berkouwer critiques its static tendencies.
- **Relational/functional view:** Positions the image in relation and vocation; favored by Berkouwer as theologically robust.
- **Original righteousness / vestigia:** The status/qualities given in creation; corrupted by the Fall.
- **Fall / original sin:** Not merely ancestral guilt but distortion of vocation, will, and relations; affects the whole person.
- **Freedom:** True human freedom is bound to vocation and oriented to God; sin twists freedom into self-dominion.
- **Christ as image / exemplar:** Christ is the normative human and the means of restoration; image fulfilled in his person and work.
- **Sanctification / renewal:** Progressive restoration of the image by Spirit and Word, culminating eschatologically.
- **Eschatological consummation:** Final fulfillment of the image at the resurrection and new creation.
- **Scripture and authority:** Scripture provides the canonical grid for anthropology; not a scientific manual.
- **Days Of Creation:** Treated as theological and formative narrative; Berkouwer resists simplistic concordism and affirms theological truthfulness of Genesis.
- **Science And Scripture (Genesis 1 11):** Berkouwer models a non-hostile dialogue: scientific hypotheses may inform reading but cannot displace theological claims about origin, dignity, and sin.
- **Vocation / representation:** Humanity's task to steward and represent God; ethical implications for social life.
- **Analogical relation to God:** Human likeness is real but analogical and derivative, not ontologically identical.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Definition source for contemporary Reformed accounts of **imago Dei** emphasizing vocation and Christological restoration.
 - Exegetical and methodological model for engaging **Genesis 1-11** with science - supplies a theological restraint on literalism and a canonical alternative to concordism.
 - Polemical resource against both metaphysical reductionism (anthropology as substance only) and scientism that would nullify theological anthropology.
