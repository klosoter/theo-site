### TITLE
Credo: A Presentation of the Chief Problems of Dogmatics with Reference to the Apostles' Creed - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the interwar period (published 1938), Credo appears amid Barth's mature development after the 1919-36 Dogmatics beginnings. It responds to liberal theology, rising secular ideologies, and seeks a compact dogmatic primer rooted in the historic creeds for German-speaking Protestantism and wider ecumenical readership.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Dogmatics must be disciplined by the Apostles' Creed: true doctrinal reflection begins and is oriented by the triune God's self-revelation in Jesus Christ. The chief problem is how to present coherent systematic theology that remains faithful to the confession against modern rationalism and speculative metaphysics.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Takes the Apostles' Creed as the skeleton of dogmatics: God the Father (Creator), Jesus Christ (incarnation, atonement, resurrection), Holy Spirit (life, Church), the Church, forgiveness, resurrection, life everlasting.
 - Moves christocentrically: revelation is an event in Jesus Christ; the Trinity is confessed in relation to this saving event rather than as an abstract metaphysical doctrine.
 - Reorients doctrinal loci around Scripture-as-Word and the creed-as-confession: dogmatics is theological reflection under the Word.
 - Engages Trinitarian grammar and the renewal of creedal language for contemporary believers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Patristic witnesses (Athanasius, Augustine), Reformation figures (Luther, Calvin), contemporary dialectical theologians, and (implicitly) liberal theologians and modern biblical criticism; addresses the ecumenical creeds and the Western addition of the Filioque.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Trinity, Christology (incarnation, atonement, resurrection), Holy Spirit and Pneumatology, Church and sacrament, forgiveness, eschatology (resurrection, life everlasting), Scripture as Word.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Dogmatics is confessionally bounded theological speech: the triune God is known and named only in the saving Word-event of Jesus Christ and therefore doctrine must submit to the creed-shaped revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Christocentric dogmatics:** all loci are illuminated by the one decisive act of God's revelation in Jesus Christ.
 - **Creed as method:** the Apostles' Creed supplies the theological itinerary and normative shape for reflection rather than abstract axioms or philosophical metaphysics.
 - **Dialectical posture:** maintains a robust Creator-creature distinction; theology is answerable to God's initiative, not human speculation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies that make theology reflective upon human religious experience; opposes any natural theology that presumes knowledge of God apart from Christ.
 - Reclaims patristic and Reformation resources against purely historical-critical or existential reconstructions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframing of Trinitarian talk as primarily an account of God's saving work (economic grounding) that must steer doxological confession and dogmatic formulation.
 - Emphasis on the creed as a living confessional center rather than a mere historical document.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Quickly received as an accessible entry to Barthian dogmatics; used by clergy and students as a creedal primer.
 - Influenced 20th-century Reformed and ecumenical discussion of the Trinity, Christology, and creedal renewal.
 - Stimulated later debate about the relationship between economic and immanent Trinity (and by extension, Filioque controversies).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact, disciplined introduction to Barthian method and Trinitarian christocentrism.
 - Valuable for ecumenical teaching on creeds and for critiquing modern theological assumptions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apostles' Creed:** Structural and normative backbone; Barth reads it as the confessional roadmap for dogmatics.
- **Revelation:** Evental and concrete in Jesus Christ; not a generalized religious datum.
- **Christocentrism:** The methodological priority of Christ in ordering all theological loci.
- **Word of God:** The living event (and its bearing in Scripture and proclamation) to which doctrine is subordinate.
- **Trinity:** Confessed insofar as the triune God acts in redeeming history; Barth stresses the economic Trinity as the decisive starting point.
 - relation to Filioque: Barth critiques uncritical metaphysical readings of the Filioque, insisting on careful patristic and biblical grammar that privileges the Father's role while recognizing the Spirit's relation to Son in the economy.
- **Filioque:** Treated as a contested later Western addition; Barth warns against doctrinal formulations that obscure the creed's evangelical center and foster speculative theology.
- **Church:** The Spirit-wrought community and the historical locus of confession and sacrament.
- **Atonement:** Central redemptive event; the cross-resurrection nexus as the focal point of God's decisive act.
- **Scripture:** Normative witness to the Word-event; Scripture functions as witness rather than independent source of metaphysical proof.
- **Eschatology (resurrection/life everlasting):** Integral creedal eschatological hope that concludes dogmatic reflection.
- **Dialectical theology:** The method of keeping God's otherness and initiative central in theological reflection.
- **Creedal grammar:** Barth's phrase-concept for using creed-language as the disciplined vocabulary for speaking of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Barthian method and the shape of creed-centered dogmatics.
- As a **polemic** against liberal and natural-theology approaches and against unchecked metaphysical elaborations (including problematic uses of the Filioque).
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading creeds theologically rather than historically only, useful in ecumenical and Trinitarian studies.
