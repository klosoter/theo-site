### TITLE
Compendium and Catechetical Writings - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th century Geneva (professor at the Academy of Geneva); composition across the 1670s-1680s within the Reformed scholastic milieu.
 - Reaction to post-Reformation controversies: **Amyraldianism, Arminianism, Socinianism**, and emerging **Cartesian** philosophy. Intended for academy and church instruction (seminary lectures and catechesis).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology is a disciplined, propositional science grounded in Scripture and confessed standards; its task is to define, defend, and apply revealed truth against error for the church and academy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: **elenctic** (thesis - objections - refutation - solution); careful definitions, loci (doctrinal headings), proof-texting and syllogistic reasoning.
 - Emphasis on Scripture as the ultimate rule; use of reason and philosophy as subordinate, instrumental aids.
 - Systematic coverage from knowledge of God and Scripture through covenant, Christ, redemption, sacraments, church, and last things.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opponents: **Moïse Amyraut** (hypothetical universalism), **Arminians**, **Socinians**, and **Cartesians**/rationalists.
 - Sources: Reformed confessions (Helvetic, Westminster), scholastic tradition (late medieval and Protestant scholastics), extensive biblical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture; **natural theology vs special revelation**.
 - God (attributes, Trinity), creation and providence, covenant theology, Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), soteriology (election, atonement, grace), sacraments (signs and seals), church and governance, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin locates theology as a confessional, polemical, and academic science: a rigorously argued, Bible-rooted discipline whose aim is the clear definition and vigorous defense of Reformed doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that theology is **objective, propositional, and confessional**; opposed to sentimental or strictly experiential reductions of theology.
 - High valuation of systematic precision: careful technical definitions and distinctions to avoid equivocation and error.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Amyraldian** modifications of soteriology: defends particular redemption and classical Reformed doctrines of election and atonement.
 - Against **Cartesian** subjectivism and rationalist autonomy: affirms the primacy of Scripture and the legitimacy but limits of natural reason.
 - Opposes **Socinian** denials of Trinity and atonement through historical, logical, and exegetical argument.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Popularized use of the **elenctic method** in Reformed pedagogy; standardization of loci and disputational format for pastoral and academic use.
 - Clarifies the relation of **natural theology** (what can be known of God by reason) and **special revelation** (Scripture as normative).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Core text for Reformed seminaries from Geneva to North America; major influence on Princeton theology and 18th-19th century conservative Reformed instruction.
 - Reintroduced scholastic rigor into confessional teaching while providing weapons against modernizing tendencies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for combining **catechetical clarity** with rigorous apologetics; valuable for students learning to argue doctrine precisely and pastorally.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elenctic method** - thesis/antithesis/refutation pattern; training in disputation and defense.
- **Propositional theology** - doctrine stated as true/false propositions grounded in revelation.
- **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture as sole infallible rule; hermeneutical and epistemic anchor.
- **Special revelation vs. natural theology** - distinction between revealed truth and what reason can discover; both used but prioritized.
- **Hypostatic union** - technical Christological formulation defended against Socinian and other denials.
- **Particular redemption (limited atonement)** - defended against Amyraldian hypothetical universalism.
- **Predestination / election** - classical Reformed treatment: unconditional election, reprobation distinctions clarified.
- **Covenant theology** - covenantal ordering of soteriology and ecclesiology; careful locus on covenant administrations.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals** - instrumental and covenantal functions emphasized.
- **Confessionalism** - theology framed and tested by Reformed confessions as ecclesial standards.
- **Authority and inspiration** - doctrines of Scripture's inspiration, sufficiency, and clarity (perspicuity) explicated.
- **Use of reason** - legitimate but subordinate: logic and metaphysics employed for clarity, not to supersede revelation.
- **Polemical theology** - sustained engagement with contemporary heterodoxy; theology as apologetic practice.
- **Doctrinal loci** - systematic headings that organize theological inquiry for teaching and catechesis.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: precise technical definitions for loci theologiae in Reformed dogmatics.
 - As **polemic**: model responses to Arminian, Socinian, and rationalist critiques.
 - As a **catechetical/exegetical model**: concise formulations and proof-texting useful for pastoral instruction and seminary exams.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: exemplar of confessional scholastic method bridging academy and church.
