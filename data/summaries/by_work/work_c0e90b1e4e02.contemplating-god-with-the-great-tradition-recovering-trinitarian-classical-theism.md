### TITLE
Contemplating God with the Great Tradition: Recovering Trinitarian Classical Theism - Craig A. Carter

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary resurgence (early 21st century) of interest in classical theism within evangelical and Reformed circles; reaction against modern theistic personalism and process theology.
 - Carter writes as a constructive retrievalist, drawing on the patristic and medieval "Great Tradition" to reformulate doctrine for present theological, philosophical, and pastoral challenges.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Christian doctrine of God is best preserved and renewed by a synthesis: **Trinitarian classical theism** - retaining classical metaphysical attributes (simplicity, immutability, aseity, omnipotence, timelessness) while grounding personal relationality in orthodox Trinitarian relations (procession, spiration, perichoresis).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Critique of modern alternatives (theistic personalism, process theology, reductive immanence) for fragmenting God or subverting classical metaphysics.
 - Part II: Historical retrieval of the Great Tradition (Cappadocians, Augustine, Aquinas) showing how classical attributes and Trinitarian relationality are compatible.
 - Part III: Constructive proposal for articulating divine simplicity with real intra-divine relations (relations of origin, not composition), defending doctrines like immutability and impassibility against misreadings.
 - Part IV: Practical theology implications - worship, prayer, Christology and eschatology reshaped by a recovered Trinitarian classical theism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, Thomas Aquinas.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of theistic personalism and social Trinitarianism, process theologians, some analytic philosophers of religion.
 - Engages recent evangelical retrievalists and critics who either reject classical metaphysics or reduce Trinitarian distinctiveness.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs economic), divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, omniscience/omnipotence, providence, Christology, contemplation/worship, implications for eschatology and cultural engagement.

- **Closing line**
 - Carter urges that a faithful and spiritually fruitful doctrine of God must marry the metaphysical depth of the Great Tradition to Trinitarian relationality, thereby grounding Christian worship, Christology, and eschatological hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Argues for a robust recovery of **divine simplicity** while refusing to collapse personhood into impersonal monism; persons distinguished by relations of origin, not by metaphysical parts.
 - Emphasizes contemplative theology: doctrine shaped by doxology and prayerful attention to God, not merely by abstract metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern theistic personalism that treats the Trinity as a plurality of independent centers of consciousness (social Trinitarianism), arguing this risks polytheism or denies divine simplicity.
 - Challenges process theology and immanentist trends that subordinate divine transcendence or deny classical perfections.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames a middle path labeled **"Trinitarian classical theism"** - a term stressing continuity with both classical metaphysics and Trinitarian patristic insight.
 - Reframes relations in the Godhead as ontologically real but non-compositional, permitting genuine relationality compatible with simplicity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Found traction among evangelicals and Reformed scholars seeking metaphysical depth for doctrine of God.
 - Provokes critique from social Trinitarians and some analytic philosophers who dispute the coherence of divine simplicity or its doctrinal consequences.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise handbook for integrating historical Trinitarianism with contemporary concerns: doctrinal clarity, spiritual formation, and apologetics.
 - Useful pedagogically for courses on doctrine of God, Trinitarian theology, and historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitarian classical theism** - Carter's synthesis: classical attributes + orthodox Trinitarian relations.
- **Divine simplicity (DS)** - God has no metaphysical parts; attributes are identical with God's essence; Carter defends DS against charges of incoherence.
- **Relations of origin** - Father, Son, Spirit distinguished by procession and spiration; used to explain intra-Trinitarian personal distinctions without composition.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling as the model for interpersonal unity in God; central to Carter's relational yet simple Trinity.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; grounds divine freedom and independence from creation.
- **Immutability / Impassibility** - Carter defends classical formulations while allowing qualified economic dynamism appropriate to revelation and incarnation.
- **Economic vs Immanent Trinity** - Carter insists on consonance: economic acts disclose but do not invent the immanent relations.
- **Actus purus** - God as pure act: no potentiality; ties to simplicity and to divine perfection.
- **The Great Tradition** - Patristic and medieval sources Carter treats as normative warrant for theological retrieval.
- **Theistic personalism** - Contemporary rival position Carter critiques for fragmenting divine unity.
- **Contemplative theology** - Methodological stance: doctrinal recovery proceeds in and for worshipful contemplation.
- **Analogical predication** - Reasserted as the proper mode for speaking of God, against univocal or merely equivocal talk.
- **Eschatological implication** - Recovery secures a transcendent, hopeful telos for culture and the church (ties to Christ and Culture in Eschatological Perspective).
- **Non-compositional relations** - Technical term to avoid partitive language while accounting for real distinctions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for courses on classical theism and Trinity, clarifying technical terms (simplicity, perichoresis).
- As a **polemic** against social Trinitarianism and process theology, used in debates over personhood and divine metaphysics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in linking doctrine of God to worship, Christology, and eschatological cultural critique (helps situate Christ-and-culture debates within a robust Trinitarian frame).
