### TITLE
The Old Is Better: New Testament Essays in Support of Traditional Interpretations (Robert H. Gundry, 1982)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1980s reaction within conservative New Testament scholarship. Emerged amid debates sparked by E. P. Sanders' work on Second Temple Judaism (covenantal nomism) and the rising *New Perspective on Paul* (NPP). Gundry writes as a defender of long-standing Protestant/Reformed exegesis against revisionist readings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament, properly read by historical-grammatical and patristic-informed methods, supports traditional Reformation-era readings of justification and atonement (notably forensic imputation); recent NPP-style reappraisals are methodologically and exegetically inferior.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Methodological insistence on careful exegesis of Pauline texts and immediate context rather than wholesale sociological reconstructions.
 - Close readings of key texts (especially Pauline passages on justification and "works of the law") aiming to vindicate forensic, imputed righteousness.
 - Critical engagement with NPP proponents and with attempts to interpret Second Temple Judaism as ethically indistinguishable from Pauline soteriology.
 - Defense of penal substitutionary over against primarily covenantal or non-forensic models.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Principal interlocutors include E. P. Sanders and early NPP advocates (e.g., James D. G. Dunn), plus classical patristic and Reformation sources as corrective witnesses. Gundry mobilizes Pauline epistles, lexical and syntactical analysis, and patristic tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (central), forensic imputation, atonement (penal substitution), covenant theology (implicit/explicit), Pauline soteriology, hermeneutics/exegesis. Secondary touchpoints: Second Temple Judaism and interpretive method.
- **Closing line:** A forceful plea that careful exegetical work upholds the traditional, forensic framework for justification and that departures rooted in sociological reconstruction (the NPP) fail to account for textual and theological data.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** Strong recommitment to *forensic* language and legal metaphors in Paul; emphasis on sustained clause-level exegesis rather than programmatic sociological reinterpretation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** Direct corrective to E. P. Sanders and early NPP claims that Paul opposes only ethnic boundary markers rather than a works-based righteousness. Gundry argues NPP underplays Pauline forensic categories and overreads Second Temple evidence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Not so much innovation as reassertion: Gundry reframes contemporary debates by recovering patristic and Reformation terminological habits (e.g., imputation, justification-as-declaration) as legitimate and textually grounded.
- **Reception and influence:** Received positively among conservative and Reformed exegetes as a concise polemical resource; used less by NPP proponents. Helped galvanize traditionalist responses in the 1980s and contributed to subsequent sustained debates over Pauline theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Useful exemplar of method-driven rebuttal to sociological readings; a compact resource for those defending forensic imputation and for courses contrasting NPP and traditional interpretations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Central category; argued to be forensic/declarative in Paul rather than primarily covenantal status-setting.
- **Forensic imputation:** Claimed as the Pauline paradigm - righteousness is *imputed* to the believer, not merely conferred as covenant status or produced morally.
- **Imputed righteousness vs. infused/participatory righteousness:** Gundry defends imputation (Reformation) against readings that emphasize inward transformation or covenantal inclusion as the primary meaning.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** Primary critical target; Gundry challenges NPP's reading of "works of the law" and its depiction of Judaism as covenantal nomism that nullifies forensic readings.
- **Works of the law:** Interpreted by Gundry as more broadly soteriological/legalistic in Paul, not merely ethnic boundary markers.
- **Covenant / Covenantal Nomism:** Engaged as the opposing framework; Gundry contests that covenantal nomism fully displaces forensic soteriology in Paul.
- **Penal substitution:** Affirmed as the consistent model of atonement implicit in Pauline forensics.
- **Hermeneutics (historical-grammatical):** Methodological insistence - Gundry privileges sentence-level exegesis and patristic congruence over sociological reconstruction.
- **Second Temple Judaism:** Treated critically as background; Gundry accepts its importance but disputes radical reconfigurations of Paul based on selective readings of that literature.
- **Pauline forensics:** Gundry's term for repeated legal/declaring motifs in Paul (justification, acquittal, imputation).
- **Patristic witnesses:** Used to show continuity with historic interpretive traditions favoring forensic language.
- **Exegetical rigor:** Gundry models how close lexical and syntactical work can serve theological polemics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the traditional, forensic understanding of justification in Pauline studies.
- As a **polemic** and counter-resource in debates with NPP advocates; often cited in conservative syllabi and bibliographies.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating text-centered rebuttal to sociological reconstructions.
