### TITLE
**Biblical Doctrine: A Theology of the New Testament (with Jeff Purswell)** by Wayne Grudem

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published within late 20th-early 21st century evangelical milieu; intended as a popular, portable systematic theology for churches, students, and pastors.
 - Reflects conservative evangelical commitments: high view of Scripture, confessional Protestant heritage refracted through an accessible, pastoral orientation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible, read plainly and comprehensively, supplies a coherent and practical systematic theology: doctrine should be derived from Scripture and applied to life and ministry.
 - Seeks to defend orthodox evangelical doctrines against liberal theology, theological fragmentation, and moral relativism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organized by classic loci of systematics (Scripture, God, Trinity, Christ, Spirit, salvation, church, last things, ethics).
 - Method: exegetical survey of key biblical texts for each locus, followed by clear doctrinal statements, concise analysis, and pastoral application.
 - Features: summaries, headings like "What does the Bible teach?", practical implications, and suggested further reading.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on historic Protestant sources (Augustine, Calvin, classic confessions) and contemporary evangelicals.
 - Dialogues implicitly/explicitly with modern systematicians (e.g., Millard Erickson, Louis Berkhof), liberal critics, egalitarians, and theological novelties (open theism, some charismatic excesses).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inerrancy, authority)
 - Doctrine of God and attributes; Trinity
 - Christology (incarnation, atonement, resurrection)
 - Holy Spirit (gifts, fruit, role in sanctification)
 - Soteriology (justification, regeneration, sanctification, election, perseverance)
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments/ordinances
 - Eschatology (second coming, final judgment)
 - Christian ethics (sexual morality, gender roles)

- **Closing line**
 - A compact, Scripture-centered evangelical systematic designed to teach and defend orthodox doctrine with pastoral clarity and practical application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Scriptural primacy and clarity**: doctrine should be built inductively from biblical passages, with confidence in Scripture's perspicuity for believers.
 - **Practical orientation**: doctrinal summaries are immediately tied to church life and personal holiness.
 - **Accessible pedagogy**: concise chapters, clear headings, study questions make it classroom- and church-ready.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counterposes conservative evangelical readings to liberal-critical and postliberal approaches; resists minimizing propositional truth.
 - Explicitly opposes egalitarian arguments on gender and many progressive ethical revisions; defends traditional complementarian formulations.
 - Offers conservative rebuttals to theological innovations (e.g., open theism, some liberationist strains).

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Not an innovation in doctrine, but in presentation: compresses full systematic arguments into tightly argued, pastorally usable entries that bridge exegetical data and doctrinal formulation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted as a teaching text in evangelical seminaries, Bible colleges, and church study contexts.
 - Praised for clarity and utility by many conservative pastors; critiqued by academic confessionalists and some Reformed theologians for occasional breadth-over-depth and for not always conforming to one confessional system.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a durable, user-friendly introduction to evangelical systematic theology; invaluable for teaching, catechesis, and denominational training where conservative orthodoxy is affirmed.

### KEY TERMS & USES
