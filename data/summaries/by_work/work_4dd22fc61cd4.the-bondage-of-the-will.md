### TITLE
**The Bondage of the Will (De Servo Arbitrio)** - Martin Luther, 1525

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written amid the early Reformation after Erasmus published Diatribe on Free Will (1524). Luther addresses the human will, grace, and divine sovereignty at the heart of the evangelical movement. Milieu: Augustinian anti-Pelagian retrieval against late medieval synergism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Post-Fall humanity lacks libertarian freedom toward God; the will is in bondage to sin. Salvation is monergistic: God alone efficaciously works conversion and perseverance. Scripture is sufficiently clear on these matters.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **The question matters:** Erasmus treats free will as peripheral; Luther insists it is the crux of the gospel because it decides whether salvation is of grace alone.
 - **Scripture is clear:** Against Erasmusian skepticism, Luther defends **perspicuity**, locating clarity in the things necessary for salvation, not in all curiosities.
 - **Exegesis of key texts:** Romans 9, John 6 and 8, Exodus hardening narratives, 1 Samuel, and Pauline anthropology show human inability and divine initiative.
 - **Necessity vs compulsion:** Human acts are necessary relative to nature and divine providence, yet not coerced; moral responsibility stands with bondage.
 - **Hidden and revealed God:** We know God via the **revealed Word** and promises in Christ; we do not pry into the **hidden** majesty or decretal depth.
 - **Pastoral conclusion:** Faith clings to the promissio, not to imagined autonomous power; exhortations and means are instruments by which God effects what he commands.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Primary opponent **Erasmus**; heavy appeal to **Augustine**; engagement with Paul, Moses; critique of medieval scholastic synergism; occasional reference to Church Fathers and canon law traditions.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Bibliology** (authority, sufficiency, clarity), **Theology Proper** (sovereignty, will, providence, foreknowledge, predestination), **Anthropology** (nature, will, affections), **Doctrine of Sin** (original sin, inability), **Soteriology** (grace, monergism, effectual call), **Law/Gospel and promise**.
- **Center of gravity:** God saves sinners by his effective Word; the gospel reveals this clearly in Christ while honoring God's sovereign majesty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Servum arbitrium:** Will as enslaved, not morally neutral.
 - **Perspicuity of Scripture:** Clarity in salvific matters against academic skepticism.
 - **Hidden/Revealed God dialectic:** Epistemic humility joined to confident proclamation.
 - **Necessity without compulsion:** Compatibilist logic before its later formalization.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Erasmus's** synergism and irenic skepticism; against **semi-Pelagian** habits of late medieval theology; corrective to voluntarist moralism that assumes native human ability.
 - Clarifies that exhortations do not imply human ability; they are means by which God works what he commands.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Voluntas revelata** vs **voluntas abscondita**; **necessitas** vs **coactio**; robust use of **promissio** to ground assurance in God's speech.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical for Lutheran orthodoxy; widely appropriated in the Reformed tradition (e.g., Dort's rejection of synergism; compatibilist accounts in Reformed scholasticism).
 - Echoed in Puritan practical divinity, Edwardsian freedom-of-the-will debates, and modern discussions of determinism and responsibility.
- **Enduring value:**
 - As a primer on monergistic soteriology, a model for Scripture's clarity, and a template for holding sovereignty with pastoral proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Servum arbitrium (bondage of the will):** Human will is enslaved to sin; cannot choose God apart from grace.
- **Liberum arbitrium (free will):** For fallen humans, at best an empty name in divine things; retains civil freedom in external matters.
- **Monergism:** God alone efficaciously causes regeneration and faith; excludes synergistic cooperation in conversion.
- **Perspicuity of Scripture:** The gospel and necessary doctrines are clear to the church by the Spirit through the Word.
- **Necessity vs compulsion:** Acts are necessary given nature and providence but not forced; preserves responsibility.
 - Necessity of consequence, not external coercion.
- **Deus absconditus / Deus revelatus:** Distinction between God's hidden majesty and God as revealed in Christ and the preached Word.
 - We trust the revealed promises; we do not speculate about the hidden decree.
- **Voluntas Dei revelata/abscondita:** God's will as preached in promises and commands vs the secret counsel governing all.
- **Foreknowledge and predestination:** God's knowing and willing are effectual; hardening and mercy display sovereignty without injustice.
- **Original sin / total inability:** Radical corruption of intellect, affections, and will; spiritual inability without grace.
- **Law and Gospel:** Law exposes sin and inability; Gospel promises and effects what it commands by the Spirit.
- **Promissio (promise):** The external Word of promise creates faith; grounds assurance beyond self-assessment.
- **External Word:** The preached Scripture and sacraments as instruments of divine action, not mere information.
- **Admonitions and means:** Divine imperatives and ordinances are the ordained means by which God brings about obedience.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** Source-text for clarity, authority, and the sufficiency of Scripture in core doctrines.
 - **Theology Proper:** Classic articulation of sovereignty, will, and providence with hidden/revealed distinction.
 - **Anthropology and Sin:** Definitive statement on inability and bondage post-Fall.
 - **Soteriology and Covenant/Promise:** Monergistic grace through the Word of promise; pattern for law/gospel preaching.
