### TITLE
How Old Is the Earth? Anthropomorphic Days in Genesis 1 (Presbyterion, 1994) - Jack Collins

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s evangelical academic milieu: rising pressure to reconcile biblical interpretation with mainstream geology and astronomy; dialog between conservative Reformed exegetes and both Young-Earth Creationists (YEC) and Old-Earth proponents.
 - Presbyterion as an evangelical scholarly outlet; Collins writing from a confessional Reformed perspective seeking careful hermeneutics rather than popular apologetics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1 uses **anthropomorphic language** to describe divine activity (i.e., "days" are presented in human terms), so the text does not compellingly require 24-hour, divine-duration days; this hermeneutic opens space for an old-earth reading without abandoning biblical authority.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates prevalence of anthropomorphic predicates in biblical descriptions of God's action (e.g., "rest," "work," "day") and argues they are functional accommodations to human experience.
 - Examines Hebrew term **yom** and the "evening and morning" formula; shows lexical range and context-dependence; warns against syllogistic literalism that ignores semantic flexibility.
 - Contrasts phenomenological/anthropomorphic description with the theological claims of Genesis (e.g., God as creator, ordering of cosmos) to show theological intent is preserved even if "days" are non-chronological in human terms.
 - Concludes that Genesis 1's purpose is theological representation of creation order, not a scientific chronicle, so one may consistently accept an old earth while affirming the text's theological witness.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages modern creationist literature (implicitly or explicitly countering YEC assertions), classical interpreters (e.g., Augustine's non-literal readings), and contemporary semantic studies on Old Testament Hebrew.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (accommodation and communicative intent), creation (ontological claim versus chronology), hermeneutics (historical-grammatical method and semantic fields).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Genesis 1 speaks authoritatively about God as Creator through anthropomorphic, theologically-purposeful language; recognizing that **"days" are described anthropomorphically preserves biblical authority while permitting an old-earth cosmology**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Coines the or popularizes the technical label **"anthropomorphic days"** to describe God's workdays as accommodated language rather than literal divine time-slices.
 - Stresses semantic nuance of **yom** within canonical and extra-biblical Hebrew usage as decisive for hermeneutical humility.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on strict YEC literalism that reads Genesis 1 as a scientific chronicle of 24-hour divine days.
 - Stops short of endorsing any single scientific reconstruction (e.g., day-age, progressive creationism); instead offers a linguistic-theological bridge.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames the interpretive move as an application of **divine accommodation** specifically applied to chronological language in Genesis 1.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a useful resource within Reformed and broader evangelical circles for those seeking a theologically conservative but scientifically informed reading of Genesis.
 - Cited in subsequent debates over creation chronology as an exegetical alternative to both strict literalism and non-literalizing skepticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, principled model for integrating biblical theology with mainstream science without capitulating to concordism; remains a staple citation for teachers and pastors navigating Genesis and science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anthropomorphic days**
 - Days described in human-relational terms applied to God's actions; key analytic term introduced/utilized by Collins.
- **Accommodation**
 - Divine condescension in revelation; how God communicates using human modes of expression, applied to temporal language.
- **Yom (day)**
 - Hebrew term with semantic range; Collins emphasizes context-determined meaning rather than automatic 24-hour assumption.
- **Evening and morning formula**
 - Literary marker whose function Collins evaluates as phenomenological/liturgical more than strictly chronological proof-text.
- **Phenomenological language**
 - Description from human perspective (appearance) rather than technical cosmological reportage.
- **Historical-grammatical method**
 - Method defended and employed; semantic sensitivity to lexical range and authorial intent is foregrounded.
- **Literalism (chronological)**
 - The position Collins critiques when applied uncritically to "days" in Genesis 1.
- **Concordism**
 - Attempt to force Genesis account into modern scientific categories; Collins warns against naïve concordism.
- **Theological intent / cosmological ordering**
 - Distinction made between Genesis' theological claims (ordering, purpose) and precise scientific chronology.
- **Exegetical exemplar**
 - Collins's article functions as a model for close lexical and theological reading in service of doctrinal fidelity.
- **Polemic utility**
 - Used against YEC claims that Genesis must fix a 24-hour chronology.
- **Definition source**
 - Cited as a concise definitional articulation of "anthropomorphic days" for theological dictionaries and syllabi.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As an **exegetical model** in Genesis courses illustrating semantic/contextual analysis of yom.
 - As a **polemic reference** in debates with Young-Earth positions, offering a conservative alternative to literalist readings.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrine of accommodation with creation theology without fixing a scientific timeline.
