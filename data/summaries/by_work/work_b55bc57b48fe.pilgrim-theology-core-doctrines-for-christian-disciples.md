### TITLE
**Pilgrim Theology: Core Doctrines for Christian Disciples** (Michael S. Horton)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2013 (Zondervan) amid evangelical and Reformed retrieval movements; an abridged, catechetical distillation of Horton, The Christian Faith (2011).
 - Situated within confessional Reformed orthodoxy, dialoguing with broader evangelicalism, the New Perspective on Paul, Federal Vision, and contemporary liturgical renewal.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Christian discipleship is generated and sustained by the gospel of the triune God, delivered through Word and sacrament, understood in a covenantal, redemptive-historical framework. Doctrine fuels doxology and discipleship in the church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Organizing rubric: **Drama, Doctrine, Doxology, Discipleship** for each locus.
 - Narrative coordinates: creation, fall, redemption, consummation with an already/not yet eschatology shaping pilgrim identity.
 - Covenant theology frames Scripture and soteriology: Covenant of Works, Grace, and Redemption; law and gospel distinction; union with Christ at the center of the ordo salutis.
 - Ecclesial focus: church as embassy of the kingdom; ordinary means of grace; marks and mission under Christ the head.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture read canonically and Christocentrically; Reformed confessions (Heidelberg, Belgic, Westminster), patristic and medieval sources (Athanasius, Augustine, Anselm), Reformation and post-Reformation divines (Luther, Calvin, Turretin), modern Reformed (Bavinck, Berkhof).
 - Critical engagements: Barthian actualism, New Perspective on Paul (e.g., N. T. Wright), Federal Vision, Roman Catholic sacramentalism post-Trent, Pentecostal-charismatic emphases; American revivalism and moralism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology and revelation; Trinity; creation and providence; anthropology and sin; Christology; soteriology (election, calling, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance); ecclesiology and sacraments; pneumatology; covenant theology; eschatology; Christian ethics and vocation.
- **Closing line**
 - The pilgrim church lives from the triune God's gospel, in union with Christ, by the Spirit's ordinary means, journeying toward the consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - The 4-D schema: Drama-Doctrine-Doxology-Discipleship as an integrated pedagogical path.
 - Law and gospel distinguished but never separated; third use of the law for sanctification.
 - Union with Christ as the integrative soteriological principle; justification by imputation as constitutive, sanctification as consequent.
 - Strong retrieval of the **ordinary means of grace** and weekly Lord's Day liturgy shaping discipleship.
 - Covenantal reading of Scripture with continuity of the one covenant of grace; baptism and Lord's Supper as signs and seals.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against activism, decisionism, and therapeutic moralism: prioritizes God's external Word and sacraments over inward techniques.
 - Nuanced critique of revivalism and pragmatism; correction of biblicist proof-texting via redemptive-historical exegesis.
 - Pushback on NPP and Federal Vision regarding justification, covenant, and assurance; distinguishes Christus Victor as fruit of penal substitution, not its replacement.
 - Two-kingdoms informed account of vocation over transformational triumphalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Didactic reframing of loci through the pilgrim motif and the 4-D cycle.
 - Ordo salutis within historia salutis, avoiding individualism by ecclesial and covenantal location.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed churches and seminaries for catechesis and foundations courses; appreciated by non-Reformed readers for clarity.
 - Critiqued by Baptists on baptism, by some neo-Calvinists on two-kingdoms accents, and by charismatics on ordinary-means emphasis.
- **Enduring value**
 - A concise, integrative map that ties doctrine to worship and life; reliable for cross-loci orientation and teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Drama-Doctrine-Doxology-Discipleship**: fourfold pedagogical lens connecting story, confession, worship, and life.
- **Law and Gospel**: God's commands vs God's saving promise in Christ; distinguished for assurance and sanctification.
- **Covenant of Works/Grace/Redemption**:
 - Works: Adamic probation; federal headship.
 - Grace: one unfolding covenant culminating in Christ.
 - Redemption: intra-trinitarian pact grounding redemption.
- **Union with Christ**: Spirit-wrought bond in which all benefits are received; unites historia and ordo salutis.
- **Justification by Imputation**: forensic declaration on the basis of Christ's active and passive obedience, received by faith alone.
- **Sanctification**: Spirit-enabled renewal in union with Christ; law's third use guides grateful obedience.
- **Ordinary Means of Grace**: Word, sacraments, and prayer as the Spirit's appointed instruments for creating and sustaining faith.
- **Marks of the Church**: pure preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and discipline.
- **Visible and Invisible Church**: external covenant community and the elect known to God; guards against perfectionism and sectarianism.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals**: Baptism and the Supper confer what they signify by the Spirit to faith; spiritual real presence in the Supper.
- **Redemptive-Historical Hermeneutics**: Christ-centered reading of the canon; type-antitype fulfilled in Christ.
- **Already/Not Yet**: inaugurated eschatology framing assurance, mission, and patience in pilgrimage.
- **Two Kingdoms and Vocation**: distinction between redemptive kingdom and common callings; neighbor love in ordinary work.
- **Assurance**: grounded in Christ's objective work and promises, confirmed by the Spirit through means and fruit.
- **Scripture's Authority and Clarity**: inspired, sufficient canon interpreted in the church, with confessional accountability.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source for Reformed positions on Scripture, church, sacraments, and salvation.
 - As a polemical reference against NPP, Federal Vision, revivalism, and sacramentalism detached from the Word.
 - As an exegetical and catechetical model for redemptive-historical preaching and teaching.
 - As a conceptual pivot for integrating doctrine, worship, and discipleship in ecclesial practice.
