### TITLE
**John M. Frame, "Covenant and the Unity of Scripture," in Perspectives on the Covenant (1980)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century Reformed renewal (post-1970s), conversation among Vosian, Klinean, and confessional streams of covenant theology.
 - Addressed an audience of Reformed theologians and pastors seeking a coherent hermeneutic that unified Old and New Testaments under covenantal categories.

- **Central thesis**
 - The covenant concept-properly understood as a single covenantal economy of redemption-is the primary structural principle that secures the unity of Scripture and directs Christian doctrine and interpretation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and function: explains covenant as relational, promissory, and mediatorial; distinguishes covenant substance (promise of grace centered in Christ) from its various historical administrations.
 - Redemptive-historical continuity: argues for one **Covenant of Grace** manifested through successive administrations rather than multiple competing covenants that sever OT/NT continuity.
 - Confessional anchoring: contends that **confessional formulations** (e.g., Westminster tradition) capture this unity and provide a normative interpretive grid for Scripture.
 - Hermeneutical implications: derives methodological rules for typology, law/evangel interpretation, sacramental practice (baptism, Supper), and ecclesial identity.
 - Polemical moves: critiques readings that overemphasize discontinuity (legalistic or sectarian bifurcations) and nuances some Klinean treaty-model emphases while affirming the value of redemptive-historical categories.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages historically rooted Reformed authorities (Calvin, Vos), contemporary voices (Meredith Kline, progressive covenant critics), and confessional texts (Westminster Standards).
 - Dialogues implicitly with theological critics who posited multiple unrelated covenants or who minimized confessional continuity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics, covenant theology (Covenant of Grace, Covenant of Works), Christology (mediatorial promise), soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, typology, law and gospel distinction.

- **Closing line**
 - Presents covenant (as one promissory economy centered in Christ) as the indispensable theological key that binds the Bible into a single, interpretable whole.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that confessional statements are not merely historical artifacts but functional hermeneutical tools that safeguard scriptural unity.
 - Emphasizes administrative plurality within a single Covenant of Grace-terminology carefully parsed to preserve both continuity and historical variation.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moderates extreme Klinean separatism by reasserting classical Reformed emphases on promise and federal headship while still appreciating redemptive-historical insights.
 - Opposes readings that treat OT and NT as hermeneutically isolated books or that make covenant categories purely sociological rather than theological.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the distinction between the ontological unity of the covenant and its historical administrations; uses this pair to resolve apparent tensions in typology and law interpretation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Resonated strongly in conservative Reformed and confessional circles; used to bolster institutional catechesis and sermon praxis.
 - Influenced subsequent systematic and practical treatments of covenant hermeneutics, especially among those seeking to integrate confessional fidelity with redemptive-historical method.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical bridge between confessional formulations and redemptive-historical scholarship; retains utility for teaching, polemics, and exegetical orientation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - central promissory covenant that unites OT and NT revelation; the work is a key reference for affirming one Covenant of Grace across administrations. (See: Covenant Of Grace)
- **Covenant of Works** - distinguished as antecedent principle governing original covenantal responsibility; used to locate the need for the Covenant of Grace.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant** - historical modes (patriarchal, Mosaic, NT) that embody one substance in diverse forms.
- **Unity of Scripture** - the thesis that covenantal structure is Scripture's organizing principle; hermeneutic opposite to bifurcation models.
- **Typology** - read Christ as fulfillment of covenant promises; typology governed by covenant substance, not merely typological analogy.
- **Promise vs. Law** - frames law as covenantal obligation and promise as the core of redemptive economy; used to adjudicate law/gospel tensions.
- **Confessional Formulations** - the confessions (e.g., Westminster) presented as faithful summaries and hermeneutical aids for understanding covenant unity. (See: Confessional Formulations Of Covenant)
- **Federal Headship** - Christ as representative and mediator within the Covenant of Grace; explanation for corporate continuity and identity.
- **Mediatorial Covenant** - the role of Christ in securing and administering covenant promises across history.
- **Sacramental Signs** - baptism and Supper treated as covenantal seals consistent across administrations.
- **Redemptive-historical method** - historical unfolding of the one covenant; recommended as the correct interpretive stance.
- **Hermeneutical principle** - confessions + covenantal lens as the normative guide for preaching and doctrine.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for teaching the Covenant of Grace and its administrations in systematic theology and catechesis.
 - As a **polemic** against readings that fragment biblical unity or dismiss confessional standards.
 - As an **exegetical model** to justify typological readings and sacramental continuity grounded in confessional formulations.
