### TITLE
The Anticipatory Corpse: Medicine, Power, and the Care of the Dying - Jeffrey P. Bishop

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in the context of early-21st-century medical humanities and critical bioethics. Engages recent hospice/palliative movements, intensive-care expansion, and Foucauldian studies of medicine and biopower. Intersects with rising debates over end-of-life autonomy, euthanasia, and technological life-prolongation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Modern biomedical practice organizes the living toward death by treating the dying as an already-formed corpse - an "anticipatory corpse." This mode of care is structured by disciplinary and sovereign power relations that shape what counts as a life worth sustaining and what counts as mere biological residue.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnoses a cultural-medical logic: contemporary medicine simultaneously produces life-managing knowledge and a dispositional regime regarding dying bodies. 
 - Uses Foucauldian genealogy to trace how clinical categories, technologies, and institutional practices anticipate and prefigure death, thereby governing patients' subjectivities. 
 - Critiques both technocratic prolongation and romanticized hospice narratives; shows how palliative measures can participate in the anticipatory logic. 
 - Argues for reframing care to resist reduction of persons to corpses-in-waiting; calls for practices that preserve relational, narrative, and ethical dimensions of dying.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Central theoretical interlocutors include Michel Foucault (biopower, medical gaze), contemporary bioethicists and clinicians (palliative care literature), and cultural critics of medicalization. Secondary engagements include thinkers on sovereignty and exception (e.g., Agamben-like themes) and critics of death-denial culture (Kubler-Ross as cultural referent).

- **Doctrines treated (theological import):** 
 While not explicitly theological, the book implicates doctrines of human dignity, incarnation (bodily worth), eschatology (theologia of dying and death), sin and finitude (modern attempts to master death), and pastoral care (theology of accompaniment). It raises questions for sacramental and pastoral practice about presence, embodiment, and attentiveness to persons at death.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 Bishop's work reframes the theological problem of death: modern medicine can preemptively strip the dying of personhood; theology and pastoral care must contest the "anticipatory corpse" by reclaiming embodied, relational, and eschatological views of dying persons.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Coins and operationalizes the phrase **"anticipatory corpse"** to capture a sociomedical formation that treats the living as already dead. 
 - Focuses on temporal orientation: medicine not only responds to death but temporally organizes the pathway toward it.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Moves beyond simple pro/anti-technology debates: not merely technological critique nor pastoral nostalgia for "natural" death. 
 - Critiques both aggressive life-prolongation and uncritical valorization of hospice as sometimes complicit in anticipatory logics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Treats death-management as a form of power-knowledge, blending Foucauldian biopower with death studies vocabulary (thanatopolitics). 
 - Shifts the analytic focus from moments of dying to the **anticipatory practices** embedded in institutional routines.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely adopted in medical humanities, practical theology, and pastoral studies for its critical frame. 
 - In Reformed/pastoral contexts, used to critique utilitarian or technocratic pastoral strategies and to reassert theological emphases on personhood and providence at death.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provokes careful theological reflection on embodiment, power, and the ethics of care. 
 - Serves as a corrective to both medical triumphalism and pietistic withdrawal; useful for seminars on pastoral care, bioethics, and public theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anticipatory corpse:** The central heuristic; the living patient is treated as if already a corpse, shaping care decisions, resource allocation, and moral status.
- **Medical gaze:** Clinical observation that objectifies the body, here reworked to show how it projects a future corpse onto the present patient.
- **Biopower / thanatopolitics:** Power mechanisms that manage life and death; the politics of anticipating and administrating dying.
- **Subjectification:** How patients become subjects defined by prognostic categories and institutional expectations about death.
- **Sovereignty over death:** The modern aspiration (medical and individual) to control the timing and quality of dying; the book problematizes claims to such control.
- **Palliative care / hospice:** Clinically and ethically complex; both a site of humane practice and a domain where anticipatory logics can operate.
- **Denial of death:** Cultural tendency to avoid finitude; Bishop shows its institutionalized form in medicine rather than merely cultural attitudes.
- **Advance directives / do-not-resuscitate:** Practical instruments that illustrate anticipatory governance of death and the ethical tensions they raise.
- **Life-prolongation technologies:** Ventilators, ICU interventions, and other supports that instantiate the tension between sustaining biology and respecting personhood.
- **Euthanasia / assisted dying:** Addressed as part of the landscape of choices shaped by anticipatory practices; invites critical ethical nuance rather than polemic.
- **Narrative integrity:** The threatened theological and pastoral need to sustain a dying person's story and relational identity against reductive objectification.
- **Embodiment:** The counterpoint to the anticipatory corpse; stresses continued bodily personhood and sacramental significance.
- **Clinical temporality:** How clinical timelines and prognostic frames reorient a patient's present toward an expected death.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for "anticipatory corpse" and modern medicalized death in bioethics and pastoral theology. 
 - As a **polemic** against unreflective medicalization and as a diagnostic tool in pastoral education. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading clinical encounters; used in case studies to analyze power, narrative, and dignity in end-of-life care.
