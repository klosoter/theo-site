### TITLE
**Grace Unknown: The Heart of Reformed Theology (R. C. Sproul, 1997)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed revival within evangelicalism; written as a corrective to widespread softening of classical Reformed soteriology.
 - Sproul addresses a popular audience (pastors, laity, students) while drawing on historic Reformed theology and contemporary debates (Arminian resurgence, ecumenical liberalism).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The essential character of saving grace is that it is a sovereign, unmerited gift from God which remains "unknown" to the unregenerate because human nature is radically unable to seek God. Salvation is God-originated and accomplishes what human will cannot.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Scripture teaches human alienation and radical corruption (Total Depravity), producing Total Inability to contribute to salvation.
 - Exposition: Historical and biblical exposition of grace as God-initiated, efficacious, and particular in its application (linking to classic five points of Calvinism without exhaustive systematizing).
 - Proofs: Exegetical focus on Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Ephesians), appeal to Augustinian and Calvinistic heritage, philosophical treatment of will and moral responsibility.
 - Pastoral implications: Emphasis on assurance, humility, evangelism rooted in dependence on divine action rather than human decision.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws significantly on Augustine and John Calvin; invokes the Westminster standards implicitly.
 - Opposes Arminian and semi-Pelagian positions; addresses modern critics (liberal theology, emotive revivalism) who minimize sovereignty.
 - Engages contemporary evangelical theologians and popular ministry practices that stress human ability or decision.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (Total Depravity), human will (Total Inability), grace (sovereign and efficacious), election, calling, regeneration, justification, assurance, providence.
 - Secondary treatment of covenantal shape of salvation and the doctrine of Scripture as sufficient warrant for theological claims.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - True Christian theology centers on a revelation of divine grace that is sovereign, effectual, and necessary because fallen humanity is utterly unable to initiate or contribute to its own salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Frames grace as fundamentally "unknown"-not merely doctrinally mysterious but experientially inaccessible apart from divine action; highlights epistemic and existential dimensions of grace.
 - Strong insistence on the moral incapacity (Total Inability) as distinct from mere ignorance or moral weakness.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects popularized "decision theology" by demonstrating its dependence on an assumption of human ability; contrasts sharply with Arminian synergism and semi-Pelagian optimism.
 - Pushes back against sentimentalist or therapeutic readings of grace that neglect divine sovereignty and forensic aspects of salvation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses accessible popular language to rephrase classic doctrines for contemporary readers (e.g., "grace unknown" as a memorable tagline for Reformed soteriology).
 - Emphasizes epistemic categories (knowing vs. being able to receive grace) in analyzing divine-human interaction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in late-20th and early-21st century Reformed/presbyterian circles; influential in seminary classrooms, pulpit formation, and the resurgence of evangelical Calvinism.
 - Criticized by Arminian scholars and some evangelicals for perceived determinism; nevertheless valued for clarity and pastoral thrust.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, rhetorically effective bridge between academic Reformed theology and popular ministry; durable as an introductory defense of classical Reformed soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Grace Unknown**
 - The paradox that saving grace exists and is offered in Scripture yet remains inaccessible to the unregenerate except by divine action.
- **Total Depravity**
 - Human sinfulness affects every aspect of human nature; no neutral or partially uncorrupted faculty exists for initiating faith.
- **Total Inability**
 - A stronger claim than depravity: fallen humans are constitutionally unable to repent or believe in Christ apart from regeneration.
 - Contrast: Not mere inability to do moral good in degree, but inability to respond savingly to God.
- **Sovereign Grace**
 - God as the originating and decisive agent in election, calling, and effectual salvation.
- **Unconditional Election**
 - Election grounded in God's will, not in foreseen human merit or decision.
- **Effectual Calling / Regeneration**
 - The inward, sovereign act by which God makes the sinner able to respond, producing faith and repentance.
- **Irresistible Grace (as treated)**
 - Presented functionally: when God intends to save, His grace effectively brings the elect to faith (Sproul is careful to stress efficacy rather than mechanical coercion).
- **Imputation / Forensic Justification**
 - Justification is a declarative act where Christ's righteousness is imputed to sinners; grace secures this forensic change.
- **Bondage of the Will**
 - Conceptualization of human willness under sin; used to rebut the presupposition of autonomous human choice in salvation.
- **Common vs Saving Grace**
 - Distinguishes general goodness of God (restraining sin, providential blessings) from particular saving grace that changes status before God.
- **Assurance**
 - Pastoral fruit of understanding grace as effectual; grounded in God's action rather than wavering human effort.
- **Scriptural Exegesis (Pauline focus)**
 - Romans and Ephesians used as primary texts demonstrating sovereignty and human inability.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a compact **definition source** for Total Depravity and Total Inability in classroom and sermon preparation.
- As a **polemic** against decisionism, semi-Pelagianism, and contemporary Arminian emphases.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline soteriology with theological and pastoral integration.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed apologetics emphasizing divine initiative and assurance.
