### TITLE
Bible and Mission: Christian Witness in a Postmodern World (Richard Bauckham, 2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century, marked by intensified postmodern critiques of metanarrative, pluralism, and loss of public Christian consensus.
 - Missiological debate between privatized spirituality, social-action models, and proclamation-focused evangelism; influence of Lesslie Newbigin and renewed canonical/theological readings of Scripture.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church's mission must be grounded in the Bible as the authoritative narrative witness to God's saving acts. In a postmodern public square, faithful mission is communal testimony to God's decisive act in Christ - above all the resurrection as inauguration of the new creation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: postmodernity undermines universalist propositional claims and fragments public discourse about truth and meaning.
 - Resource: the Bible supplies a coherent, public narrative (not merely private devotional material) that informs authentic Christian witness.
 - Theological center: proclamation of Jesus' death and resurrection as the decisive eschatological act that inaugurates the new creation; mission announces and enacts that reality.
 - Practical implication: mission must be both word and deed-public testimony shaped by canonical theology, eschatological hope, and communal witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues implicitly with Newbiginian missiology, postmodern critics of metanarrative, and contemporary missiological trends; engages biblical-theological scholarship and church tradition rather than technical historical-critical minutiae.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Bible as witness), Christology (incarnation and resurrection), Eschatology (new creation), Ecclesiology (church as witness), Ethics (new-creation implications), implicit Trinitarian framework in mission.
- **Closing line**
 - Mission is the church's public, communal testimony to God's decisive act in Jesus - the resurrection that inaugurates the new creation - and the Bible is the canonical narrative that must shape and authorize that witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the Bible primarily as public testimony for mission rather than as private devotional/manualist text or only an object of historical-critical study.
 - Centers the resurrection not as individual immortality but as definitive inauguration of the new creation - the decisive eschatological event that must shape proclamation and practice.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both privatized, therapeutic spirituality and social-gospel-only formulations by reasserting proclamation of God's saving acts as primary.
 - Distinguishes from purely propositional apologetics: argues for narrative, communal testimony grounded in Scripture to engage postmodern sensibilities.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Casts mission language in terms of "Bible-as-witness" and "witness-as-public-narrative," aligning canonical biblical story with mission praxis.
 - Reframes resurrection language as the hinge between present mission and future consummation - a present inauguration, not just future promise.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelical, Anglican, and academic missiologists seeking a robust biblical-theological foundation for mission in postmodern contexts.
 - Valued for integrating canonical theology with practical missiology; some critique for underplaying cultural hermeneutics and the plurality of interpretive communities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for reading Scripture missionally; keeps eschatology and resurrection central to evangelical praxis and teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Bible as witness** - Scripture is the church's public testimony to God's saving acts; primary resource for mission.
- **Mission as testimony** - Mission primarily involves public proclamation and communal witness to God's acts, not merely social programs.
- **Postmodern context** - Cultural setting skeptical of universal propositional claims; demands narrative and public credibility.
- **Resurrection** - God's decisive act in Jesus; inaugurates the new creation and anchors mission proclamation.
 - Emphasized as new-creation inauguration rather than simple individual resuscitation.
- **New creation** - The eschatological reality already begun in Christ; shapes ethics, worship, and mission identity.
- **Canonical reading** - Interpreting Scripture as a single, coherent story that grounds theology and mission.
- **Public truth** - The claim that biblical testimony can and should address public questions of truth and justice.
- **Eschatological ethics** - Moral life formed by the reality of the new creation inaugurated by Christ.
- **Communal witness** - The church as corporate narrator and testifier rather than atomized believers giving private answers.
- **Proclamation vs. social action** - Integrated insistence that proclamation is central but must be embodied in deeds shaped by the new creation.
- **Incarnation** - Foundation for mission: God's coming in Christ validates public historical claims.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Not abstract propositionalism but the Bible's authority as faithful witness for mission.
- **Witness-language** - Emphasizes testimony, narrative credibility, and historical acts over abstract proof-claims.
- **Kingdom inaugurated** - The kingdom of God present in the resurrection as the basis for mission activity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for resurrection-as-new-creation in eschatology and mission studies.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized faith or purely social-gospel models of mission.
 - As an **exegetical/canonical model** recommending Bible-as-narrative for theological construction and practical missiology.
