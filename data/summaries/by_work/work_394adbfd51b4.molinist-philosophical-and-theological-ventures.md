### TITLE
**Molinist Philosophical and Theological Ventures - Kirk R. MacGregor**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theological engagement with a historical Jesuit tradition (Luis de Molina, 16th-17th c.) brought into conversation with late 20th-21st century analytic metaphysics, modal semantics, and debates over divine providence and human freedom.
 - Interlocutors include classical Molinists and contemporary defenders/critics in analytic philosophy of religion.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Molinism (centered on **scientia media**, or middle knowledge) can serve as a coherent and theologically fruitful framework to reconcile divine omniscience and providential governance with libertarian human freedom; the volume maps philosophical resources and theological consequences of that claim and addresses major objections.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the Molinist schema: God's knowledge ordered as natural knowledge, middle knowledge (counterfactuals of creaturely freedom), and free knowledge of the world God chooses.
 - Technical defense of the intelligibility and metaphysical status of counterfactuals of freedom (CCFs) as truth-bearers and their truthmakers.
 - Application to theological loci: providence, election, sin, prayer, and theodicy (including transworld depravity and election models).
 - Critical engagement with rivals: simple foreknowledge models, Calvinist compatibilist accounts, and open theism.
 - Final assessment of tensions and open problems (e.g., grounding objection, metaphysics of possible worlds).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Luis de Molina, later Jesuit Molinists, Suarezian refinements.
 - Contemporary: William Lane Craig, Alvin Plantinga (as interlocutor on modal metaphysics and essences), Thomas Flint and other critics (grounding objection), proponents of open theism and classical Reformed critiques.
 - Philosophical tools: possible-worlds semantics, truthmaker theory, modal metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine knowledge (omniscience), providence, predestination/election, human freedom and responsibility, sin (esp. transworld depravity), prayer, and aspects of theodicy and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - Molinism, properly articulated and defended against its metaphysical critics, is presented as a systematic middle path that preserves robust divine sovereignty while making room for genuine libertarian human freedom and a theologically actionable model of providence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a modular, philosophically disciplined account of scientia media as central to theological anthropology and providence.
 - Prioritizes contemporary metaphysical and semantic tools (truthmakers, essences, possible-worlds frameworks) in reconstructing Molinist claims.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects simplistic readings of foreknowledge that collapse divine knowledge into determinative decree or into open theist indeterminacy.
 - Offers targeted replies to the grounding objection by exploring potential truthmakers (essences, modal realism, divine decrees as explanatory frameworks).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and refines terminology around CCFs, transworld depravity, and the ordering of divine knowledge for analytic clarity.
 - Develops pragmatic criteria for when Molinist explanations provide superior theological and pastoral resources (e.g., for prayer and providential planning).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable within analytic philosophy of religion and among theologians seeking a middle way between strict Calvinism and open theism.
 - Criticized by some Reformed theologians for perceived erosion of deterministic election; praised by others for explaining divine foresight and human responsibility.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous interdisciplinary work: historical theology, analytic metaphysics, and systematic theology mutually inform each other.
 - Serves as a sustained roadmap for addressing the grounding objection and integrating Molinist insights into broader doctrinal systems.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism**
 - The theological system that centers on God's middle knowledge to reconcile divine foreknowledge and libertarian free will.

- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)**
 - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (counterfactuals of freedom), logically prior to God's creative decree.

- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)**
 - Propositions of the form "If person P were in circumstance C, P would freely do action A." Central technical object; contested regarding truthmakers.

- **Grounding objection**
 - The argument that CCFs lack adequate truthmakers (nothing in reality grounds their truth), posing a metaphysical challenge to Molinism.

- **Truthmaker**
 - Entity or state of affairs that metaphysically grounds the truth of a proposition; used in responses to the grounding objection (essences, God's knowledge, possible-worlds constituents).

- **Transworld depravity**
 - The Molinist notion that some beings would sin in every feasible world in which they are created, used to explain universal sinfulness and election patterns.

- **Simple foreknowledge vs scientia media**
 - Simple foreknowledge: God knows future free acts but does not use counterfactuals as counsels; scientia media posits a prior cognitive order of counterfactuals that informs divine choice.

- **Possible worlds/modal semantics**
 - The metaphysical and semantic apparatus often employed to model divine knowledge and evaluate CCFs.

- **Libertarian freedom (incompatibilist)**
 - The view upheld by Molinists: free choices are not deterministically caused by prior states, yet are foreknown by God via middle knowledge.

- **Divine sovereignty/providence**
 - Molinist account preserves sovereignty by God choosing which feasible world to actualize on the basis of middle knowledge.

- **Predestination/election (Molinist framing)**
 - Election explained as God's selection of a world where certain free responses obtain, rather than an irresistible decree caused by election.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source**: clarifies and standardizes Molinist vocabulary (scientia media, CCFs, transworld depravity).
 - As a **polemic resource**: deployed against strict Calvinist determinism and open theist accounts that reject middle knowledge.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model**: supplies a framework for interpreting biblical texts on providence, election, and prayer without collapsing divine freedom or human responsibility.
