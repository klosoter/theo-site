### TITLE
Westminster and the Theonomy Movement (WTJ, 1982) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 1980s debate: rise of theonomy/dominion movements (Rushdoony, Bahnsen, North) within conservative Reformed circles; renewed attention to Meredith Kline's covenantal frameworks.
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal as a confessional, scholarly response from within the Westminster tradition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin argues that theonomy and certain applications of Klinean covenant theology (notably "intrusion ethics") misread the Westminster standards and the New Testament, producing an improper demand that modern civil magistrates enforce the Mosaic civil code.
 - The key issue: proper relation of Mosaic law to the church and state after Christ's fulfillment of the law.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-ecclesial claim: the Westminster Confession and divines do not support theonomy's insistence that the Mosaic civil law remains directly binding as civil statute for Christian nations.
 - Christological hermeneutic: the law is fulfilled in Christ; fulfillment reshapes the law's function and continuity.
 - Ethical-political implication: the moral law retains normative force as a guide to Christian conduct, but theonomy overextends by collapsing moral, civil, and ceremonial categories into a single program for magistrates.
 - Interaction with Kline: Gaffin critiques Kline's "intrusion" motif when it is read to imply ongoing, unmodified enforcement of Mosaic civil prescriptions in post-Christ society.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: leading theonomists (e.g., R. J. Rushdoony, Greg Bahnsen) and the reception of Meredith Kline's covenant schema.
 - Sources: Westminster Standards (Confession and Larger/Shorter Catechisms), New Testament warrant for law and fulfillment, patristic/Reformed exegesis implicitly appealed to.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (continuity/fulfillment)
 - Doctrine of the law (moral vs. civil/ceremonial distinctions)
 - Christology (fulfillment of the law in Christ)
 - Ecclesiology and polity (role/limits of the civil magistrate)
 - Ethics and eschatology (present ethics vs. consummation)

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers a **Westminster, christocentric hermeneutic**: the law's continuity is mediated by Christ's fulfillment, thereby limiting theonomy's direct application of Mosaic civil codes and tempering Klinean "intrusion" claims about covenant ethics driving immediate civil legislation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the primacy of the Westminster standards as the corrective interpretive grid for Reformed political-ethical claims.
 - A Christ-centered reading of law that prioritizes fulfillment over mere continuity.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects theonomists who read Westminster as endorsing civil imposition of Mosaic civil law.
 - Counters Klinean formulations when they are pressed into a political program that eliminates the historical distinctions the Confession preserves.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses the phrase "intrusion ethics" (as a lens on Kline) to describe ethics that are supposed to 'intrude' from covenantal acts into political enforcement; reframes and critiques that move from covenant event to civil statute.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited by confessional Reformed theologians as a careful corrective to theonomy.
 - Reinforced WTS's mainstream confessional stance against dominionist readings; influential in seminary teaching and polemical writings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a measured, confessional method for adjudicating contemporary ethical-political claims.
 - Remains a go-to resource for pastors and scholars seeking a historically rooted critique of theonomy and overzealous applications of covenantal motifs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theonomy**
 - Movement advocating that God's law, including Mosaic civil statutes, should govern contemporary civil society; target of Gaffin's critique.

- **Klinean Covenant Theology**
 - Meredith G. Kline's covenantal schema emphasizing royal-covenantal acts and structure; influential but, in Gaffin's view, misapplied when pressed into theonomy.

- **Intrusion Ethics**
 - Term used to describe Kline-influenced moves whereby covenantal divine acts are said to 'intrude' ethically into history, yielding immediate civil demands-criticized for bypassing Christological fulfillment and historical distinctions.

- **Westminster Confession**
 - Confessional standard appealed to as interpretive norm; Gaffin argues it does not authorize theonomic civil imposition.

- **Fulfillment (of the law)**
 - Christ's accomplishment that reconfigures the law's application; central to Gaffin's hermeneutic.

- **Moral/Civil/Ceremonial Distinctions**
 - Traditional Reformed categories used to analyze which aspects of Mosaic law continue to bind and how; Gaffin defends a nuanced application against fusionist theonomy.

- **Civil Magistrate**
 - Office whose role Gaffin limits relative to theonomy: magistrates enforce justice per natural law and civil equity, not wholesale transplantation of Mosaic civil codes.

- **Christocentric Hermeneutic**
 - Reading law and covenant through Christ's person and work; the controlling principle for ethical and political claims.

- **Continuity vs. Discontinuity**
 - Debate concern: what of the Old Covenant law continues? Gaffin affirms principled continuity mediated by fulfillment, not unmodified civil transplantation.

- **Dominion**
 - Theological motif in theonomy referring to cultural/political rule; Gaffin critiques simplistic applications that ignore confessional constraints.

- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definitional source**: clarifies what theonomy claims and what Westminster actually teaches.
 - As a **polemic**: primary intra-Reformed rebuttal to popular theonomy in the 1980s onward.
 - As an **exegetical/hermeneutical model**: exemplifies a Christ-centered, confessional method for handling law and covenant.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminaries: used to teach limits of applying Old Testament civil prescriptions to modern polity.
