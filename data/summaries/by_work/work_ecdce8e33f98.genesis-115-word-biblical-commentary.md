### TITLE
Genesis 1-15 (Word Biblical Commentary) - Gordon J. Wenham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published in the Word Biblical Commentary series (1987). Wenham writes from a conservative evangelical, British Anglican scholarly milieu that engages historical-critical methods while affirming the theological integrity of Scripture.
 - Moves within late-20th-century English-language OT scholarship that dialogues with German critical traditions, Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) comparative studies, and evangelical exegesis.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Genesis 1-15 presents the foundational account of creation, human failure, and the initiation of the Abrahamic covenant; Wenham argues these chapters must be read as coherent theological narrative that grounds later covenant, election, and eschatological expectations (including the hope for a renewed creation).

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Detailed verse-by-verse exegesis with attention to Hebrew syntax, lexicon, and form-critical divisions.
 - Major moves:
 - Genesis 1: a Priestly, structured account of creation emphasizing order, goodness, divine speech, and divine rule.
 - Genesis 2-3: Yahwist material that focuses on human vocation, sin, and broken relationship with God and creation.
 - Genesis 4-11: The escalating consequences of sin (Cain, flood, Babel) that universalize human failure but also preserve a seed-line.
 - Genesis 12-15: The call and covenant promise to Abram as the decisive break: election, land, progeny, and blessing for the nations.
 - Wenham consistently relates literary form to theological function, resisting reductive mythological readings while using ANE parallels for illumination.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Dialogues with Wellhausenian source criticism, Von Rad, Claus Westermann, Gerhard von Rad, Nahum Sarna, and contemporary English-speaking commentators.
 - Uses ANE parallels (Enuma Elish, Atrahasis, Gilgamesh) and philological data to contextualize motifs (creation, flood, covenant).
 - Engages canonical-theological voices (e.g., Brevard Childs) in integrating exegesis with theological reading.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Creation** (order, goodness, divine sovereignty)
 - **Sin and fall** (anthropology, culpability, cosmic effects)
 - **Covenant and election** (Abram/Abraham as axis for promise and salvation-historical development)
 - **Blessing and mission** (God's intent for nations)
 - **Typological/eschatological horizons** (Genesis as the theological ground for later hopes of restoration, e.g., new creation themes)

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** 
 - Wenham anchors Genesis 1-15 as the theological foundation of the biblical storyline: God as sovereign creator who judges sin yet initiates covenantal promise, setting in motion a redemptive plan that culminates in the renewal of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong balance of rigorous Hebrew philology and pastoral theological sensitivity; Wenham presses for literary coherence without sentimental harmonizing.
 - Emphasizes the functional roles of the Priestly and Yahwist materials rather than collapsing them into mere sources.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against overly mythologizing ANE-parallels approaches that reduce Genesis to derivative myth; affirms distinct theological aims of Israelite texts.
 - Moderates extreme source-hypothesis fragmentation by reading narrative theology across divisions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clear articulation of Genesis as a covenantal framework from creation to promise; maps canonical-theological continuities (creation -> fall -> promise -> covenant) with clarity useful for evangelicals.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries and commentarial libraries for its dependable exegesis and accessible scholarship.
 - Respected by both conservative and critical scholars for balance; often cited in discussions of creation theology and the Abrahamic covenant.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Excellent model for combining philological detail, ANE context, and theological synthesis; remains a go-to resource for preachers, teachers, and doctoral students engaging Genesis 1-15.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation (bara, asah):** Wenham distinguishes divine fiat and ordering language; stresses goodness and purpose.
- **Chaos/Tehom:** Notes ANE motifs of chaotic waters but argues Israelite theology reframes chaos into ordered cosmos under YHWH.
- **Priestly (P) vs. Yahwist (J):** Functional-literary distinctions: P = cosmic structure, liturgical emphasis; J = anthropic, narrative intimacy.
- **Covenant (berit):** Central to chapters 12-15; Wenham analyzes covenant enactment language (cutting, oath formulas) and its promise structure.
- **Election/Promise (chosenness, blessing):** Abram as elect recipient whose call carries universal intent (bless the nations).
- **Flood tradition:** Comparative treatment with Atrahasis/Gilgamesh, but read theologically as judgement + preservation motif.
- **Sabbath/land motif:** Creation Sabbath as theological backdrop to land promises and covenantal rest.
- **Image of God (tselem):** Explores functional anthropology-human rule and relational standing before God.
- **Blessing (berakah):** Ethical and missional axis-blessing as God's program for humanity and nations.
- **Typology/Canonical trajectory:** Genesis as formative for later scriptural themes, especially restoration.
- **New Heavens and New Earth (eschatological relation):** Wenham treats Genesis as providing the ontological basis for eschatological renewal: Genesis does not explicitly describe the eschaton, but its doctrine of ordered creation and covenant promise undergirds later promises of a renewed creation.
- **ANE parallels:** Used critically to illuminate motifs without collapsing Israelite uniqueness.
- **Form-critical categories:** Narrative, etiological, legal-covenantal forms applied to interpret function.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating Hebrew philology and narrative-theology.
 - As a **definition/source** for evangelical treatments of creation, covenant, and the theological basis for hopes like the new heavens and new earth.
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductive myth-comparative readings and loose harmonizations in popular treatments.
