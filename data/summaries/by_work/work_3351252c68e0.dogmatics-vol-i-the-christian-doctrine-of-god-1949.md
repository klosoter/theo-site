### TITLE
**Emil Brunner, Dogmatics, Vol. I: The Christian Doctrine of God (1949)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Swiss Reformed, postwar phase of dialectical theology; English trans. 1949 of the first volume in a 3-volume Dogmatics.
 - Written amid critiques of liberal Protestantism and naturalism; in dialogue (and dispute) with Barth after the 1934 Nature and Grace exchange.
 - Draws on Reformed sources (Calvin), Luther, Kierkegaardian-existential accents, and personalist philosophy (Buber).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The true knowledge of God is given in God's self-revelation as personal address in Jesus Christ; theology is accountable to this event of the Word and ordered to faith and obedience, not to metaphysical speculation or religious experience.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Knowledge of God:** Humans possess a responsible relational capacity (imago Dei) that constitutes a limited point of contact; yet saving knowledge depends entirely on revelation and grace.
 - **Revelation as event:** The Word of God is God's free address; truth is encountered, not possessed. Revelation is Christologically centered and Pneumatologically effected.
 - **Scripture and proclamation:** Scripture is the normative witness and instrument of revelation, not its identity; the Spirit makes the Word effective in preaching and sacrament.
 - **Doctrine of God proper:** God is personal Spirit, Lord, holy love. Classical attributes are reinterpreted dynamically (God as Subject who acts) rather than as static predicates of a substance.
 - **Trinity from revelation:** The triune name arises from God's saving self-disclosure in Christ and Spirit; speculation is resisted, economic grounding is stressed.
 - **Creation orders and providence (in nuce):** Created orders signify God's will and give common ground for address, but cannot save; providence preserves and governs personally.
 - **Election and command (adumbrated):** God's decision of grace is Christocentric and summons to obedient faith; deterministic schemes are rejected.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Barth (revelation, natural theology), Schleiermacher and liberal heirs (experience, immanence), Thomism (analogia entis), Luther/Calvin (Word, faith), Kierkegaard/Buber (I-Thou), Kant (limits of reason), Ritschl, Harnack, Bultmann (kerygma, myth).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and knowledge of God; Scripture and proclamation; Trinity; divine attributes; providence and creation orders; beginnings of Christology and soteriology insofar as God is known only in Christ.

- **Center of gravity**
 - The living God addresses us in Jesus Christ by the Spirit; theology must be a responsible explication of that encounter as command and gift.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Truth as encounter (Wahrheit als Begegnung):** Knowledge is relational and existential.
 - **Personalist theism:** God as Subject who loves, commands, and meets us.
 - **Point of contact (Anknuepfungspunkt):** The imago Dei remains as relational capacity, enabling address without enabling self-salvation.
 - **Dynamic attributes:** Holiness-love governs power and freedom.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **liberalism:** No ascent from religious consciousness to God; revelation is God's sovereign act.
 - Against **scholastic metaphysics:** Resists substance metaphysics; prefers biblical-personal predicates.
 - Nuanced divergence from **Barth:** Affirms very limited general revelation/orders of creation; rejects the analogia entis yet posits an analogia relationis grounded in creation and covenant.
 - Against **biblicist inerrancy:** Scripture is infallible in its witnessing function rather than via a prior theory of inerrancy.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies **Word as event** and **address**; integrates I-Thou language into theology proper.
 - Rearticulates **imago Dei** as capacity-for-responsibility, sustaining ethics and public theology via creation orders.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical neo-orthodox circles; a bridge between Barthian dogmatics and personalist-existential currents.
 - Critiqued by strict Barthians for natural-theological concessions; critiqued by conservatives for Scripture doctrine.
 - Influential for relational theism, theological ethics, and homiletics focused on divine address.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically clear on revelation and Trinity from Scripture's witness.
 - Provides a durable alternative to both rationalism and subjectivism, centering theology on the living God's self-gift in Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation as event:** God's free self-disclosure in Christ by the Spirit; not a deposit of propositions.
- **Word of God (as address):** The living speech-act of God; Scripture and preaching serve as instruments.
 - Distinguish witness (Scripture) from event (revelation) without separating them.
- **Truth as encounter:** Knowledge realized in obedient faith; relational and existential.
- **Imago Dei (capacity for responsibility):** Enduring relational capacity enabling God's address; not salvific power.
- **Anknuepfungspunkt (point of contact):** Creaturely openness to God's summons; grounds communication, not merit.
- **Analogia relationis vs. analogia entis:** Relational likeness rooted in creation/covenant rather than metaphysical continuity of being.
- **Orders of creation:** Providential structures of life (family, work, society) evidencing God's will; require critique by revelation.
- **Holiness-love:** Governing unity of God's attributes; love that judges and restores.
- **Personal God / Subject:** God acts, speaks, and commands; rejects impersonal absolute.
- **Trinity from revelation:** Triune naming derived from God's saving acts; economic focus over speculation.
- **Scripture as normative witness:** Authoritative instrument through which God addresses; authority is functional and Spirit-activated.
- **Faith as obedience:** Trust inseparable from response to divine command.
- **Providence:** Personal governance preserving freedom and responsibility within creation.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition-source for revelation, Scripture, and Trinity in systematics and hermeneutics.
 - As a conceptual pivot for personalist accounts of attributes, election, and covenantal relation.
 - As a polemical foil in debates on natural theology, inerrancy, and Barthian method.
 - As a theological frame for preaching and sacramental theology centered on divine address.
