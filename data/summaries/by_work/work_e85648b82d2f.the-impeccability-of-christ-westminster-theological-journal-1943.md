### TITLE
The Impeccability of Christ - John Murray, Westminster Theological Journal (1943)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theology; Murray teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary, reacting to modern critical currents that entertained Christ's "peccability" and to sloppy distinctions in popular devotional thought.
 - Engages classical patristic and scholastic claims and the Reformed confessional tradition (implicitly Westminster Standards).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ was **impeccable**: by virtue of the hypostatic union and the presence of the divine nature in the one Person of the Son, Jesus could not commit sin. Impeccability does not negate genuine human freedom, temptation, suffering, or moral responsibility.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Precise definition: distinguishes peccability (the capacity to sin) from being actually without sin; locates Christ's impeccability in the conjunction of his human nature with the divine person.
 - Scriptural warrant: treats key texts (e.g., Hebrews 4:15; 2 Corinthians 5:21; John 8:46) to show simultaneous real humanity and sinlessness.
 - Philosophical-theological analysis: explains how union with the divine person excludes the possibility of final turning-away from God without destroying genuine experience of temptation.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: argues that the value and efficacy of Christ's obedience and sufferings are not diminished by his impeccability; on the contrary, necessity rooted in his person secures expiatory and representative efficacy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis (Hebrews, Gospels, Pauline texts); implicitly dialogues with Reformers (Calvin), patristic statements and scholastic (Thomas Aquinas) treatments, and with contemporary writers who posited peccability (unnamed modern critics).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, person-nature distinction), soteriology (atonement, representative obedience), anthropology (human will and freedom), and some implications for theology of temptation and divine immutability.
- **Closing line**
 - Murray's kernel: Christ's inability to sin is theologically necessary to his role as sin-bearing, representative Redeemer, while his temptations and voluntary obedience remain genuinely human.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful semantic and theological separation of *inability to sin* from *lack of genuine human experience*; stresses that impeccability is not an ontological diminishment of Christ's humanity.
 - Grounds impeccability chiefly in the **hypostatic union** (the divine Person's assumption of human nature) rather than in merely moral perfection or privation of inclination.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against any account that treats impeccability as an abstract metaphysical impossibility unconnected to personhood or against those claiming Christ could have sinned without contradiction.
 - Refines scholastic and patristic talk by insisting on precision about person-nature relations so as to avoid Nestorian or Monophysite pitfalls.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the interplay between necessity (impeccability) and voluntariness (real obedience) in the Redeemer - uses nuanced categories of moral responsibility without adopting modern libertarian freedom.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed circles and systematic theologies that followed Murray (mid-to-late 20th century); frequently cited in Reformed Christological and soteriological treatments.
 - Served as a corrective to mid-century theological proposals tending toward the peccability thesis; shaped subsequent exegetical appeals to Hebrews and classical doctrinal formulations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous precision: concise theological argumentation linking biblical exegesis, systematic categories, and pastoral concern.
 - Remains a go-to corrective for students confronting modern attempts to soften the dogma of Christ's sinlessness while preserving authentic human experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability** - The doctrine that Christ could not sin; an incapacity rooted in the hypostatic union and the divine Personhood of the Son.
- **Peccability** - The claim that Christ had the capacity to sin; Murray argues against this as theologically untenable for the Redeemer.
- **Hypostatic union** - The personal union of divine and human natures in the one Person of the Son; the locus of Christ's inability to sin.
- **Human will (of Christ)** - Real, voluntary, and morally responsible; nonetheless aligned with the divine will in such a way that sin was impossible for the incarnate Son.
- **Temptation** - Real and intense (Hebrews 4:15), not evidence of peccability; serves to reveal and accomplish Christ's representative obedience.
- **Necessity vs. contingency** - Murray distinguishes a necessity of origin (rooted in Christ's person) from coercive necessity that would annul genuine obedience.
- **Representative obedience** - Christ's obedience is voluntary yet efficacious for sinners precisely because of his sinless, impeccable status.
- **Atonement value** - Impeccability secures Christ's fitness to bear sin and render satisfaction; the impossibility of sin does not negate penal substitution or moral merit.
- **Divine nature / person-nature relation** - Term-use to show why divine possession of a human nature precludes actual turning from God.
- **Moral responsibility** - Retained in Christ despite incapacity to sin; Murray insists on real agency to preserve the atoning significance of obedience.
- **Scriptural loci** - Hebrews 4:15, 2 Corinthians 5:21, John 8:46; used exegetically to demonstrate sinlessness and temptation.
- **Compatibilism (implied)** - Murray's account leans compatibilist: human freedom compatible with divine determinative elements in the mystery of union.
- **Representative / mediator status** - Impeccability is necessary to mediate and atone effectively.

How this work is used:
- As a clear **definition source** for the doctrine of impeccability in Reformed teaching.
- As a **polemic** against modern peccability proposals and imprecise popular notions of Christ's freedom.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Hebrews and relevant NT passages on temptation and sinlessness.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology and soteriology in systematic theology courses and lectures.
