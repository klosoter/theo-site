### TITLE
**The Pauline Conception of Christ** - Geerhardus Vos (Biblical and Theological Studies)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton/Reformed environment; Vos writing as a founder of modern Reformed biblical theology. Responds to critical-liberal and speculative Christologies common in 19th-century scholarship, including various forms of kenoticism and Hellenistic reinterpretations of Paul.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul presents a unified, redemptive-historical Christology: the Son's pre-existence, incarnation, humiliation and exaltation are best read as covenantal and soteriological stages, not as linguistic or philosophical accommodations that diminish the divine being. Vos opposes readings that treat kenosis as ontological divestiture of deity.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close exegesis of key Pauline texts (notably Philippians 2:5-11, Colossians 1, Romans and Galatians passages) to show:
 - Paul presupposes the Son's eternal status and role in cosmic reconciliation.
 - The "emptying" (kenosis) in Philippians is voluntary self-limitation in function and status, not loss of divine essence.
 - Humiliation and exaltation form a coherent salvific economy: incarnation → suffering/obedience → vindication/exaltation.
 - Theological synthesis: situates Pauline statements within Israel's salvation-history and covenant motifs to explain Christ's role as faithful Israel and new Adam.
 - Polemical move: critiques contemporary kenotic theories that read Philippians as evidence of an ontological alteration in the Son; reaffirms classical Trinitarian orthodoxy while preserving Pauline particularities.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicitly engages modern kenotic proponents and liberal Christologies (late 19th-early 20th century); conversant with Patristic and Reformational categories though Vos reinscribes them into a biblical-historical methodology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (pre-existence, incarnation, kenosis), Trinity (implications for divine immutability), atonement and reconciliation, resurrection/exaltation, revelation and covenantal history, soteriology (union with Christ).
- **Closing line**
 - Vos locates Pauline Christology squarely in redemptive history: the Son's self-emptying is a covenantal, voluntary mission of humility leading to vindication - a functional, not ontological, economy that preserves divine identity while explaining Christ's human obedience and sufferings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence on a redemptive-historical (diachronic) reading of Paul over abstract metaphysical reconstructions; treats Pauline Christology as organically rooted in the history of Israel and God's covenant acts.
 - Distinguishes sharply between functional/relational status and ontological substance when interpreting kenosis.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects kenoticism that posits divine self-emptying as loss of attributes; opposes liberal accounts that domesticate the divine by making incarnation primarily ethical or developmental.
 - Contrasts speculative theology that divorces Paul from Israel's narrative; Vos re-grounds Paul in covenant and typology (Adam/Israel motifs).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - While not inventing new dogmatic terms, Vos legitimates the method of "biblical-theological" Christology - tracing theological meaning through redemptive history rather than constructing from systematic abstractions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a model of exegetical fidelity combined with theological synthesis; informed mid-20th century Reformed responses to kenoticism and liberal Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a corrective for readings that either mythologize Paul or subject him to modern philosophical schemes; continues to be a primary resource for those defending classical Trinitarian Christology from within a biblical-historical method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis (emptying)**
 - Vos: voluntary self-limitation in function and status (Phil 2), not loss of divine essence.
- **Pre-existence**
 - The Son's eternal status as presupposed and asserted by Paul; necessary to make sense of exaltation and cosmic lordship.
- **Incarnation**
 - Covenantal entry into human history; real humanity assumed by the pre-existent Son for redemptive purposes.
- **Humiliation and Exaltation**
 - Paired soteriological stages in Paul: obedience in humility leading to vindication and universal lordship.
- **Redemptive-historical method**
 - Traces divine acts and revelation through Israel's narrative; foundation for Vos's Paul interpretation.
- **Functional vs. Ontological distinction**
 - Key hermeneutical move: changes in role/status (functional) do not imply changes in being (ontological).
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central Pauline soteriological category that links believers to Christ's humiliation-exaltation economy.
- **Reconciliation/Atonement**
 - Cosmic and covenantal dimensions emphasized in Paul: Christ as agent of creation's and Israel's restoration.
- **Covenant motifs**
 - Israelic background (election, promise, faithfulness) used to interpret Pauline Christology.
- **Philippians 2:5-11**
 - Canonical test-case for kenosis debates; Vos reads it as the locus classicus for functional emptying.
- **Colossians 1 (Cosmic Christ)**
 - Evidence of Paul's (and Pauline tradition's) universal, pre-existent Christology.
- **Pauline typology (Adam/Israel motifs)**
 - Frames Christ as the faithful representative succeeding where Adam/Israel failed.
- **Biblical-theological synthesis**
 - Methodological hallmark: exegetical detail unified into historical-theological doctrine.

How this work is used
- As a definitional source for a redemptive-historical reading of Pauline Christology.
- As a polemic against ontological kenoticism and liberal Christologies.
- As an exegetical model for interpreting Philippians 2 and Pauline christological passages within covenantal history.
