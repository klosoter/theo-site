### TITLE
The Imputation of Adam's Sin - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Reformed theological milieu (Westminster tradition). Murray writes as a systematic theologian addressing both classical patristic/Calvinian inheritance and contemporary critics of imputation.
- **Central thesis**
 - Adam sinned as the federal representative of humanity; his guilt is judicially imputed to his posterity so that all are culpable and in need of Christ, the Second Adam, whose righteousness is likewise imputed.
- **Doctrinal problem addressed**
 - How can Scripture teach both universal culpability and individual responsibility? Is original sin a matter of inherited guilt or only inherited depravity? How to defend forensic imputation against Pelagian, semi‑Pelagian, and modern reinterpretations?
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis: sustained attention to Genesis 2-3 and Romans 5 as loci classicus for representation and imputation.
 - Theological categories: distinguishes juridical (forensic) imputation from ontological transmission, and correlates federal headship with covenantal representation.
 - Philosophical and theological defense: argues that only a representative (federal) model explains universal guilt without denying individual moral agency.
 - Comparative dialectic: contrasts imputation with competing accounts (Pelagianism, social/psychological contagion, "mere example" readings).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical: Augustine, Calvin, John Owen.
 - Modern interlocutors: contemporary Reformed theologians skeptical of immediate imputation; critics influenced by newer historical-critical and sociological readings of sin (broadly the "modern critics" of federal imputation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (nature and origin of sin), Covenant theology (federal headship), Doctrine of sin (original sin and depravity), Soteriology (forensic justification by imputed righteousness), brief connections to Christology (Christ as Federal Representative).
- **Closing line**
 - Murray locates the doctrine of Adamic imputation at the intersection of covenantal representation and forensic justification: without federal imputation the biblical narrative of universal guilt and universal need of redemption collapses.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the **forensic character** of imputation: guilt is legally reckoned, not merely biologically transferred.
 - Clear articulation that imputation and inherited corruption are related but distinct realities.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges views that reduce Adam's role to a moral example or to purely sociobiological transmission of sin.
 - Counters modern attempts to relativize Adamic headship by appeal to developmental psychology or non-representative models.
- **Conceptual or terminological clarifications**
 - Tightens language around "imputation" vs "transmission" and "immediate" (forensic) vs "mediate" (via corrupted nature) accounts.
 - Reframes federal headship in covenantal-legal terms rather than only ethical pedagogy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed seminaries as a standard defense of traditional federal imputation.
 - Cited by later proponents of covenant theology and by theologians rebutting non-imputational readings of Romans 5.
 - Provoked critique from theologians who favor more existential or corporate-sin readings of Paul (including some proponents of the New Perspective on Paul).
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined interplay of exegesis and systematic theology; remains a touchstone for discussions of original guilt, representative headship, and the logic of justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imputation**
 - Juridical reckoning of another's sin or righteousness to a person; central category in Murray's argument.
- **Federal Headship**
 - Representative leadership: Adam as corporate head whose act legally binds his successors.
- **Original Sin**
 - The inherited condition of guilt and corruption stemming from Adam's fall; treated as both forensic and ontological elements.
- **Original Guilt**
 - The aspect of original sin that concerns culpability legally counted to persons because of Adam's federal act.
- **Forensic / Judicial**
 - Emphasis that imputation operates in the courtroom of God rather than being merely a psychological or biological process.
- **Seminal Transmission (Traducianism)**
 - The claim that soul and sin are transmitted via generation; contrasted with Murray's primary appeal to federal/imputed guilt.
- **Creationism (of the soul)**
 - The view that souls are created afresh by God for each person; discussed as background to debates over how sin is transmitted.
- **Representative Covenant**
 - Covenant framework for understanding Adam's role as head and the legal effects upon his descendants.
- **Second Adam / Christ**
 - Christ as the counter‑representative whose righteousness is imputed to believers, parallel to Adam's imputation of sin.
- **Depravity / Corruption**
 - The ontological consequence-inner corruption of nature-distinguished from imputed guilt.
- **Mediate vs Immediate Imputation**
 - Mediate: guilt flows via corrupted nature; Immediate: direct legal reckoning from Adam; Murray highlights the necessity of immediate imputation for exegetical coherence.
- **Historic Adam**
 - The insistence on Adam as an actual historical representative rather than merely archetypal or mythical.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Opposed views minimizing inherited guilt and human inability; Murray uses these as polemical foils.
- **New Perspective critiques**
 - Modern exegetical challenges to traditional imputational readings; Murray's work is often invoked against non-imputational reconstructions.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definitional source** for the doctrine of imputation and the vocabulary of forensic reckoning.
- As a **polemic** against Pelagian, semi‑Pelagian, and non‑imputational modern readings of Romans 5.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Adam-Christ parallels in Paul within covenantal theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments linking anthropology (sin) to soteriology (justification).
