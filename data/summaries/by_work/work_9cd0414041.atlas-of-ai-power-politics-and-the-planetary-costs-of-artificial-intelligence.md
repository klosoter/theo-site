### TITLE
Atlas of AI: Power, Politics, and the Planetary Costs of Artificial Intelligence
Kate Crawford (Yale University Press, 2021)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2021 amid rising public debate over AI ethics, surveillance capitalism, and climate crisis.
 - Situated in critical AI studies, science and technology studies (STS), environmental humanities, and social justice movements opposing techno-solutionism.
 - Responds to industry rhetoric of "immaterial" cloud services and disembodied algorithms.

- **Central thesis**
 - AI is not an abstract, purely computational realm but a socio-material, extractive infrastructure whose power is sustained by resource extraction, exploitative labor, environmental degradation, and institutional violence. The book argues that the true costs of AI are planetary and political, not merely technical.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Atlas-style mapping: a sequence of richly documented chapters that trace the infrastructures, actors, and sites that make AI possible.
 - Maps material inputs: minerals, fossil fuels, datacenters, supply chains.
 - Exposes labor: data labeling, crowdwork, logistical networks, outsourced and precarious labor.
 - Connects to state and military power: surveillance, policing, and defense contracting.
 - Links environmental impact: carbon-intensive compute, e-waste, landscape disruption.
 - Examines governance: corporate consolidation, intellectual property, regulatory gaps.
 - Repeated move: deconstruct tech rhetoric (neutrality, efficiency, inevitability) and replace it with an account of vested interests and ecological consequences.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages STS scholars, investigative reporting, environmental science, labor studies, and legal/regulatory literature.
 - Interacts critically with industry actors (Google, Amazon, Microsoft, defense contractors) and thought leaders who promote AI optimism (Silicon Valley narratives).
 - Dialogues implicitly with scholars like Ruha Benjamin (race & tech), Shoshana Zuboff (surveillance capitalism), and others in critical data studies.

- **Doctrines and theological motifs treated**
 - Not explicitly theological, but relevant themes include:
 - **Creation / stewardship**: human impact on planetary systems via technological extraction.
 - **Anthropology**: redefinition of human labor and personhood under automated regimes.
 - **Sin and idolatry**: critique of techno-idolatry and commodification of life.
 - **Justice / covenantal ethics**: implications for distributive justice, colonial continuities, and the vulnerable.
 - **Eschatological resonances**: warnings about planetary thresholds and futures shaped by power.
 - Usefully read as a prophetic indictment rather than doctrinal treatise.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Crawford issues a prophetic ecological and political diagnosis: AI reveals modern idolatry of extraction and efficiency, calling theological ethics to resist infrastructural sins that remake creation and human life for profit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Materiality: insistence that AI's "digital" effects rest on physical extraction, energy, and labor.
 - Planetary scale: frames AI as a driver of planetary transformation, not merely social change.
 - Infrastructural gaze: maps often-invisible supply chains, data centers, and logistics as sites of moral concern.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects the narrative of AI as neutral tool or mere software by foregrounding ecology and labor.
 - Contrasts with techno-optimist accounts that prioritize innovation and efficiency over justice and sustainability.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the metaphor of an "atlas" to show distributed, layered infrastructures.
 - Reinforces and popularizes terms like **data colonialism**, **compute-as-extraction**, and **training as environmental cost**.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in STS, AI ethics, environmental humanities, and public policy debates.
 - Influential for activist networks and NGOs advocating data justice, climate accountability, and labor protections.
 - Growing uptake in theological and religious ethics circles as an empirical resource for ecological and social critique.

- **Enduring value**
 - Empirical grounding: robust descriptive work that supplies concrete cases for normative reflection.
 - Pedagogical: excellent for courses on technology and religion, political theology, or creation care.
 - Heuristic: provides a conceptual pivot away from algorithmic abstraction toward material accountability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **AI myth of immateriality**
 - The mistaken belief that AI exists solely as code and computation, divorced from physical consequences.

- **Infrastructural mapping / Atlas approach**
 - Visual and narrative technique to trace networks, sites, and actors that sustain AI.

- **Data colonialism**
 - Continuation of colonial extraction logics in the collection and commodification of data from marginalized populations and territories.

- **Compute-as-extraction**
 - Treating computational power and model training as forms of resource extraction with ecological footprints.

- **Training (models)**
 - The compute-intensive process whose environmental and labor costs are often hidden.

- **Data centers**
 - Physical sites driving energy consumption, land use, and local socio-environmental impacts.

- **Labor invisibilization**
 - The outsourcing and erasure of human work (labelers, moderators, maintenance) that undergirds AI outputs.

- **Surveillance and militarization**
 - Intersections of AI with state security, policing, and military systems that amplify coercive power.

- **Technosolutionism**
 - The ideology that technological fixes can solve complex social and ecological problems without addressing structural causes.

- **Planetary costs / carbon footprint**
 - Quantitative and qualitative environmental consequences (emissions, e-waste, habitat loss).

- **Corporate consolidation**
 - Concentration of power in a few firms that control compute, data, and infrastructure.

- **Material imagination**
 - The ethical act of reimagining AI in terms of its physical impacts, not only its outputs.

- **Prophetic-ecological critique**
 - A stance that combines ecological concern with moral denunciation of exploitative systems.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: Empirical reference for definitions of "data colonialism," "compute-as-extraction," and the materiality of AI.
 - **Polemic**: Canonical critique against techno-solutionism and industry claims of neutrality.
 - **Conceptual pivot / exegetical model**: Employed in theological and ethical reflection to read technologies as embodied moral agents and to ground creation-care, political theology, and social justice curricula.
