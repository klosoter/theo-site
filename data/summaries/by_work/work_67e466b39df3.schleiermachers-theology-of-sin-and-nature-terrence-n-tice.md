### TITLE
Schleiermacher's Theology of Sin and Nature (Terrence N. Tice) - notes on Schleiermacher's treatment of sin, nature, foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late Enlightenment / early Romantic German theology (late 18th-early 19th c.). Schleiermacher reframes Protestant dogmatics in psychological and hermeneutical terms, reacting to Kant, Fichte, and Enlightenment moral rationalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Schleiermacher reconceives sin not primarily as metaphysical corruption but as a disorder in religious self-consciousness - a withdrawal from the sense of **absolute dependence**. The theological task is to explain how sin arises within nature and how divine foreknowledge and providence relate to moral evil without making God its author.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Natural conditions (finitude, drives, appetites) provide background; sin emerges when finite self-consciousness refuses or neglects the feeling of dependence on the Absolute.
 - God's relation to creatures is primarily **relational and persuasive**, not coercive: providence aims at moral elevation rather than deterministic control.
 - Divine foreknowledge is affirmed but reinterpreted in terms that preserve creaturely freedom and moral responsibility; foreknowledge does not equal causal predestination to sin.
 - Theodicy is reframed: the problem of evil is addressed by emphasizing God's immanent redemptive presence and the moral purpose that transforms sinful nature.
- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian and post-Kantian philosophers (Kant, Fichte), eighteenth-century rationalists, pietist and orthodox Protestant understandings of original sin, and later critics (notably Barth).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (religious self-consciousness), sin (nature, guilt, original sin), providence, divine foreknowledge, redemption (moral regeneration), revelation (felt consciousness of the divine).
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's center of gravity: sin is a relational failure in the consciousness of dependence; God's foreknowledge and providence are redemptive, noncoercive powers oriented toward restoring that consciousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **feeling of absolute dependence** as theological locus; sin is a psychic-religious dysfunction rather than ontological metaphysical corruption.
 - Providence construed as **moral governance**-God influences through purposive providence that cultivates conscience rather than deterministically ordering events.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects scholastic notions of inherited metaphysical guilt (traditional imputation) and deterministic divine causation of sin.
 - Moves beyond rationalist ethical theism by reintroducing the immediate religious consciousness as normative.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts classical categories (original sin, grace, providence) in psychological-phenomenological idiom.
 - Emphasizes *dependence* and *consciousness* as theological primitives.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on liberal Protestant theology and modern historical-critical hermeneutics.
 - Provoked strong conservative and neo-orthodox reactions (e.g., Barth) that accused Schleiermacher of minimizing objective guilt and divine transcendence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Vital for understanding modern reconfigurations of sin, human agency, and theodicy; continues to serve as a foil and resource in debates over divine foreknowledge and freedom.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence**
 - Central Schleiermacherian category: the basic religious feeling and the corrective to sin.
- **Feeling of dependence**
 - Phenomenological datum; the religious experience that roots ethics and doctrine.
- **Sin (Sünde)**
 - A relational/psychological estrangement from God; morally culpable self-centeredness rather than ontological privation.
 - Distinguished from mere natural limitation.
- **Nature**
 - The set of finite, nonmoral conditions (drives, instincts) that provide the ground in which sin arises.
- **Original sin**
 - Reinterpreted: a condition of impaired religious consciousness and predisposition to selfishness rather than imputed guilt before God.
- **Divine foreknowledge**
 - Affirmed but read so as to protect creaturely freedom; knowledge of actualities does not entail divine causation of sin.
 - Used to ground God's redemptive plan without deterministic theodicy.
- **Providence**
 - Moral and persuasive guidance; God's governance works through moral suasion and historical shaping rather than coercive determinism.
- **Theodicy / problem of evil**
 - Addressed by locating evil within finite consciousness and emphasizing God's immanent remedial activity; evil is allowed as historically proximate to moral transformation.
- **Redemption / regeneration**
 - Ethical-religious renewal: recovery of the feeling of dependence and communal life shaped by that awareness.
- **Conscience / moral predisposition**
 - Sites where providential influence operates toward restoration.
- **Immanence vs transcendence**
 - Schleiermacher stresses divine immanence (presence in consciousness) while being critiqued for attenuating transcendence.
- **Phenomenological hermeneutics**
 - Method: theological claims interpreted through lived religious consciousness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for modern, psychological accounts of sin and nature (anthropology and hamartiology).
- As a **polemic pivot** in debates on foreknowledge/providence and theodicy-both a resource for liberal theologies and a foil for neo-orthodox critiques.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading doctrines through existential/experiential categories rather than metaphysical categories.
