### TITLE
**Molinism: A Middle Knowledge Perspective** (in Four Views on Divine Providence, 2011) - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic theology (early 21st century), part of an edited volume presenting competing models of divine providence.
 - Situated in an evangelical/intellectual milieu seeking to reconcile classical theism and robust human freedom using analytic philosophy (possible worlds, modal logic).
- **Central thesis**
 - Middle knowledge (scientia media) supplies a plausible and philosophically coherent account of how an omniscient, sovereign God providentially governs history while preserving libertarian human freedom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defend the threefold division of divine knowledge: natural knowledge (what God could know), middle knowledge (what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance), and free knowledge (what actually will occur).
 - Argue that God, prior to His creative decree, knows true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom; this knowledge grounds His selection of a world to create.
 - Use possible-worlds semantics to show how God actualizes a particular "feasible" world given knowledge of creatures' free responses.
 - Show Molinism best preserves: (a) libertarian freedom, (b) divine omniscience, and (c) genuine providential governance without deterministic compulsion.
 - Address common objections: the metaphysical status/truthmakers of counterfactuals, charge of arbitrariness in God's choice, and tensions with divine timelessness/classical theism.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary historical source: Luis de Molina (late 16th century) and subsequent scholastic Molinists.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of Calvinist compatibilism, Open Theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock), analytic philosophers addressing free will (e.g., Thomas Flint, Alvin Plantinga as a philosophical foil), and critics who deny middle knowledge's coherence.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence and sovereignty, divine foreknowledge, human libertarian freedom, divine decree/creation, and to a lesser extent classical attributes (omniscience, timelessness).
 - Less emphasis on Trinitarian or Christological loci; focus is providence/anthropology and metaphysics of knowledge.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig's account centers on the claim that **God's middle knowledge is the key theological-conceptual pivot that preserves both genuine libertarian freedom and robust divine providence**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous use of possible-worlds/modal semantics to operationalize Molina's scientia media for contemporary analytic theology.
 - Emphasis on middle knowledge as epistemic prior to creation but not causally deterministic of creaturely choices.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Calvinist compatibilism by rejecting that divine sovereignty requires causal determinism of will.
 - Contrasts with Open Theism by affirming exhaustive divine foreknowledge of counterfactuals and rejecting the view that future free choices are ontologically open to God.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of Molina's scholastic categories into modern modal language: "feasible worlds," "counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)," and "actualization via creative decree."
 - Clarification of the temporal/ontological ordering: middle knowledge prior to divine decree but not prior to God's aseity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Substantially influential among evangelical philosophers and theologians seeking a third way between strict determinism and Open Theism.
 - Sparked continued debate on the metaphysical status of counterfactuals and the coherence of scientia media within classical divine simplicity frameworks.
- **Enduring value**
 - A clear, disciplined, and teachable presentation of Molinism suitable for classroom use and for engaging philosophical objections; remains a primary modern defense of middle knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism**
 - The theological system originating with Luis de Molina that centers on divine middle knowledge to reconcile providence and libertarian freedom.
- **Middle Knowledge (scientia media)**
 - God's knowledge of what free creatures would freely do in any hypothetical situation; epistemically prior to the divine creative decree.
- **Natural Knowledge**
 - God's knowledge of necessary truths and all possibilities (what could be known independent of creation).
- **Free Knowledge**
 - God's knowledge of the actual world after His decree (what will be and is).
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom (CCFs)**
 - True/false propositions of the form "If person S were in circumstances C, S would freely choose A"; central explananda for middle knowledge.
- **Possible Worlds / Feasible Worlds**
 - Modal framework used to articulate which worlds God can actualize once He knows CCFs; "feasible" = worlds consistent with creatures' libertarian choices.
- **Divine Decree / Actualization**
 - God's decision to create a specific feasible world, based on middle knowledge, thereby bringing about a providentially ordered history.
- **Libertarian Free Will**
 - Freedom incompatible with deterministic causal antecedents; preserved by Molinism through non-determinative middle knowledge.
- **Divine Sovereignty (in Molinism)**
 - Exercised by selecting which possible world to actualize rather than by causally determining every choice.
- **Foreknowledge**
 - Molinist account extends divine foreknowledge to include true counterfactuals without necessitating causal determinism.
- **Truthmakers for Counterfactuals**
 - The metaphysical grounding or explanation for why CCFs are true; a principal philosophical challenge Craig addresses.
- **Temporal Ordering vs. Ontological Priority**
 - Distinction Craig stresses: middle knowledge is logically/epistemically prior to decree but need not imply temporal succession in God's atemporal knowledge.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and concise defense of analytic Molinism for curriculum and reference.
- As a **polemic** against Open Theism and classical compatibilist accounts of providence.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical texts on foreknowledge and election in light of middle knowledge.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in philosophical theology debates over the metaphysics of counterfactuals and divine attributes.
