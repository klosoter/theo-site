### TITLE
The Covenant of Creation - Stephen G. Dempster (in Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect, 2002)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-21st-century renewal of interest in canonical and covenantal readings of Scripture. Published in a festschrift/collected-essays volume engaging retrospective and prospective directions in biblical theology.
 - Situated within a Reformed, redemptive-historical milieu that is reclaiming the theological centrality of covenant structures across Scripture.
- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 1-2 articulates a binding **Covenant of Creation** (functionally equivalent to a Covenant of Works as to substance) that sets the original divine-human relationship, stipulations, and blessings; later covenants (notably the Mosaic) are best understood as renewals, administrations, or applications of that primordial covenantal framework.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Identifies covenantal markers and legal-ethical stipulations in the creation narrative (command to image-bearing rule, sabbath, probational prohibition).
 - Argues the creation covenant carries normative, covenantal force (obligations + promised blessing) not merely descriptive or narrative framing.
 - Traces continuity: Mosaic covenant rearticulates and particularizes the obligations of creation (thus the Mosaic covenant is linked to the Covenant of Works "as to substance").
 - Employs typology and Christological reading: Adam as covenant head; Christ as eschatological/new Adam who fulfills the covenant requirements the first Adam failed to keep.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with the Reformed covenantal tradition (Westminster divines implicit), and modern proponents of a Covenant of Works model (e.g., Meredith Kline, O. Palmer Robertson).
 - Counters contemporary biblical-theological positions that deny an explicit creation covenant or that sharply sever creation and covenantal redemptive history.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, creation (creational order and mandate), law and ethics, Christology (Adam/Christ typology), anthropology (image-bearing and headship), sabbath theology, typology and redemptive-historical interpretation.
- **Closing line**
 - Dempster locates the theological gravity of Scripture in a single covenantal arc that begins with a binding Covenant of Creation whose substance governs later administrations and whose ultimate fulfillment is found in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes the *substantive* continuity between the Covenant of Creation and the Mosaic covenant (the latter rearticulates creation responsibilities rather than introducing wholly novel terms).
 - Reads Genesis 1-2 with juridical and covenantal lenses rather than treating early chapters as purely cosmogonic or etiological narrative.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that treat Mosaic law as sui generis law or as only national/ceremonial regulation; instead presents Mosaic covenant as rooted in creational norms.
 - Pushes back on approaches that marginalize a Covenant of Works concept or deny any formal creational covenant, arguing such denials fracture ethical and theological continuity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the phrase "Covenant of Creation" as analytically equivalent to a Covenant of Works "as to substance" while avoiding doctrinal caricature-focus on functional covenant elements in creation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed/evangelical circles as a concise defense of creational covenantal thinking; influential for discussions of sabbath, ethics, and the theological basis for law.
 - Has contributed to pedagogical adoption in courses on covenant theology and Genesis exegesis; discussed critically by scholars who favor alternative covenant historiographies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to dualistic splits between creation and redemption; supplies a compact exegetical rationale for treating later covenants as covenantal administrations rooted in creation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Creation**
 - The binding divine-human arrangement implicit in Genesis 1-2 that establishes obligations and promised blessing for humanity.
- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)**
 - The theological category describing the creational covenant's substantive character: law-bound obedience by a covenant head (Adam) leading to promised life/blessing.
- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Presented as a specific administration or rearticulation of creational obligations for corporate Israel; continuity rather than novelty is emphasized.
- **Creation Mandate**
 - The command to exercise dominion, steward creation, and be fruitful - read covenantally as part of the obligations under the Covenant of Creation.
- **Sabbath**
 - Treated as a covenantal sign linking creation and covenant order; a perpetual creational institution that informs later sabbatic demands.
- **Covenant Headship**
 - Adam as federal representative whose obedience/failure shapes covenant consequences; typologically anticipatory of Christ's headship.
- **Typology / Redemptive-Historical Reading**
 - Use of typological connections (Adam/Christ, Sabbath/eschatological rest) to show covenantal continuity and fulfillment.
- **Substance vs. Administration**
 - Distinction used to argue that while administrations (Mosaic, Davidic, New) differ in form, their substantive creational obligations persist.
- **Law and Ethics**
 - Moral structure rooted in creation; Mosaic law seen as applying and specifying that structure.
- **Covenant Continuity**
 - Principle that God's covenantal purposes unfold coherently from creation through redemption.
- **Creational Normativity**
 - Idea that creational order carries normative authority for theology and ethics.
- **Probation / Prohibition**
 - Genesis prohibition (tree) framed as covenantal test element - functionally like stipulations in later covenants.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the Covenant of Creation and a compact defense of the Covenant of Works notion (especially in Reformed curricula).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis covenantally and for connecting creation norms to Mosaic legislation.
- As a **polemic** against approaches that segregate creation and redemption or that deny substantive continuity between covenants.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological ethics, sabbath theology, and discussions of ecclesial practice rooted in creational norms.
