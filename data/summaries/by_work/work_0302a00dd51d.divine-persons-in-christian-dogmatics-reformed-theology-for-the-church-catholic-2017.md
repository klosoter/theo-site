### TITLE
**"Divine Persons" - Scott Swain, in Christian Dogmatics: Reformed Theology for the Church Catholic (2017)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed retrieval (early 21st century): ecumenical engagement with patristic and medieval sources, conversation with analytic theology and the "social" Trinity debates; placed within a multi-author, confessional Reformed dogmatics project.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defend a classical, Augustinian-Cappadocian account of the Trinity in which the three **divine Persons** are real hypostases distinguished by relations of origin - chiefly **eternal generation** (Son from Father) and **eternal spiration/procession** (Spirit from Father and Son) - thereby securing both divine unity and genuine personal distinction.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - exegetical grounding: Johannine and patristic readings that highlight begetting and procession language (e.g., John 1; 15-16).
 - historical retrieval: careful appeal to Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine as normative for Western-Reformed formulation.
 - metaphysical clarification: insistence on real relations (not merely conceptual) that are internal to the divine life and distinct from economic missions.
 - polemical move: critique of social-trinitarian and reductionist accounts that either collapse unity or make persons merely moral/relational centers.
 - constructive proposal: terms and distinctions (processions, personal properties, perichoresis) shaped to preserve simplicity of essence and plurality of persons.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen), Athanasius, Augustine.
 - Reformed tradition: appeal to confessional standards and figures who preserve Augustinian vocabulary.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of social trinitarianism and analytic proposals that reconceive persons as centers of relations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (primary), divine personhood, procession (eternal generation and spiration), revelation and economy of salvation (as it bears on the immanent Trinity), theological method (history + analytic clarity).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: persons are real hypostases constituted by relations of origin (eternal generation and spiration) that maintain one divine essence while securing personal distinction and the church's worshipful confession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust retrieval of classical procession language within a Reformed dogmatic framework; careful balance of patristic fidelity and analytic conceptual precision.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against social-trinitarian models that make persons primarily relational centers or moral agents; against modalism and any account that collapses persons into mere economic roles.
 - Clarifies that economic missions reflect but do not exhaust immanent relations; the Son's and Spirit's missions are not their origin.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise articulation of **spiration** as distinct from generation and as consonant with Western filioque formulations, yet argued with sensitivity to Eastern objections.
 - Use of analytic metaphors (real relation vs. conceptual relation) to rescue classical language from modern misunderstandings.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and confessional circles as a clear restatement of classical Trinitarian orthodoxy; engaged by ecumenical interlocutors for its careful handling of filioque and patristic sources.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching systematic Trinity; durable defense of classical hypostatic vocabulary against contemporary revisions; resource for pastoral and liturgical theology that depends on orthodox personhood.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Person / Hypostasis** - concrete center of the divine life; real subject, not merely role or mask.
- **Ousia / Essence** - the one divine substance shared by the three Persons; unity preserved.
- **Relation of Origin** - real relations that constitute personal distinctiveness (begetting, spirating).
 - Distinct from economic/functional relations (missions).
- **Eternal Generation** - the Son is begotten from the Father as an eternal, personal relation (basis for Son's personhood).
- **Spiration / Procession** - the Spirit's eternal proceeding; understood in a manner compatible with the filioque in Reformed retrievals.
- **Filioque** - Latin clause ("and the Son") invoked with exegetical and theological nuance; defended as preserving unity without denying distinct origin.
- **Perichoresis / Mutual Indwelling** - reciprocal interpenetration of Persons that secures unity and relationality without collapse.
- **Personal Properties** - non-relative attributes that mark each Person (begetter, begotten, spirator) rooted in relations of origin.
- **Real Relation** - relation that is ontically internal to God's life, not a mere conceptual distinction.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's self-revelation and actions in history; subordinated epistemically but reflecting immanent Trinity.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God's inner life; focus of Swain's retrieval of procession language.
- **Anti-Social Trinitarianism** - shorthand for Swain's critique of accounts that overly privatize personhood into social centers.
- **Appropriation** - theological practice of ascribing actions to particular Persons in accord with their properties while preserving unity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed teaching on persons, generation, and spiration.
- As a **polemic** against social-trinitarian and reductionist accounts of personhood.
- As an **exegetical model** for Johannine and Pauline texts bearing on Sonship and the Spirit.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical conversations about the filioque and East-West concord on processions.
