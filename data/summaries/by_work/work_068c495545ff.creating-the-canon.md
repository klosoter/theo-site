### TITLE
Creating the Canon - Benjamin P. Laird

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-Reformed academic milieu (late 20th/early 21st c.). Addresses longstanding questions in biblical studies, patristics, and systematic theology about how the biblical canon gained authoritative status within the church.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The biblical canon is not merely a list of inspired texts discovered by isolated criteria, nor purely a late institutional imposition; rather, the canon is a *church-formed* collection whose authority arises from the sustained practices of apostolic witness, liturgical use, doctrinal discernment, and communal reception.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Analytic diagnosis of competing models: (1) text-intrinsic (inspiration-first), (2) institutional-decree (top-down legalism), and (3) sociocultural-historical (contingent formation).
 - Positive proposal: a recovery of a *reception-based* model that integrates apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, and liturgical practice as co-constitutive criteria.
 - Demonstrations using patristic case studies (how specific books were received), Reformation-era debates, and modern scholarly challenges to canonicity.
 - Theological implications: how the church's recognition of Scripture functions epistemically (as warrant) and normatively (as rule for faith and life).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** patristic witnesses (Irenaeus, Athanasius, Origen in outline), key Reformation interlocutors (broadly representative of Protestant concerns about authority), and modern scholars of canon formation (e.g., canonical critics and historians of the early church such as Bruce Metzger and other standard historians - engaged as both allies and foil).
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and inspiration; ecclesiology (authority and reception); hermeneutics and the rule of faith; covenantal identity; elements of Christology insofar as apostolic witness anchors canonical shape.
- **Closing line:** Theological authority of Scripture is best understood as a ecclesial achievement: the canon is created by the church insofar as the church faithfully recognizes, preserves, and reads the apostolic witness as normative for faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong recovery of *reception* (the church's ongoing recognition) as the decisive moment in canonicity, not merely the occurrence of inspiration.
 - Integration of *liturgical use* and *doctrinal orthodoxy* as mutually reinforcing practices that shape canonicity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back on privatized readings of sola scriptura that treat canon as a static given, arguing for a relational and ecclesial understanding without dissolving scriptural authority.
 - Challenges purely sociological accounts that reduce canon formation to power dynamics or contingency by reasserting theological criteria (apostolicity, rule of faith).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of a *normative reception* vocabulary: canonicity as verdict of sustained communal assent rather than instantaneous attribute.
 - Emphasis on the *performative* aspect of canonical formation - practices (reading, preaching, sacraments) create the shape and authority of the collection.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and broader evangelical circles for restoring ecclesial practices without capitulating to clericalism.
 - Used in academic settings as a corrective to both hyper-historical and hyper-dogmatic accounts; cited in works on canonical hermeneutics and ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies the interplay of text, church, and theology; supplies a practical model for pastors and theologians navigating authority, Scripture, and tradition.
 - Serves as a bridge between patristic canonical thinking and contemporary Protestant commitments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon (canonicity):** the church-recognized corpus of authoritative Scripture; conceived as the outcome of communal recognition rather than merely a property intrinsic to texts.
- **Reception:** the historical and theological process by which the church accepts particular writings as Scripture; central explanatory category in Laird's account.
- **Apostolicity:** fidelity to apostolic witness and teaching; a primary theological criterion for inclusion.
- **Orthodoxy (rule of faith):** conformity to the core, received teaching of the church; functions as a doctrinal sieve in formation.
- **Catholicity:** broad, ecumenical usage across the church; used to check narrow or local claims.
- **Liturgical use:** public and repeated use in worship and sacraments; argued to be formative evidence of a text's authority.
- **Authority (ecclesial authority):** ecclesial recognition grants normative standing to Scripture; authority is communal, not merely institutional fiat.
- **Inspiration:** affirmed but discussed in relation to reception - inspiration is not disproved by reception, nor is it sufficient without ecclesial recognition.
- **Norma normans vs. norma normata:** interplay between Scripture as the ultimate norm and the church's normative role in recognizing that norm.
- **Canonical hermeneutic:** reading strategy that privileges the interconnectedness and final form of the canon in interpretation.
- **Ecclesial memory:** communal memory and narrative that sustain apostolic witness across generations.
- **Performative practice:** liturgy, preaching, and reading as acts that instantiate and cement canonicity.
- **Textual fixedness vs. fluidity:** awareness of historical fluidity in boundaries, but theological insistence on the eventual stability achieved through reception.
- **Creedal discernment:** role of confessions and creeds as tools in the church's recognition process.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a *definition source* for canonical formation emphasizing reception and practice.
 - As a *polemic* against both privatized sola scriptura and reductionist sociological accounts.
 - As an *exegetical model* encouraging canonical and liturgical reading that attends to the church's interpretive practices.
 - As a *conceptual pivot* connecting ecclesiology, sacramentology, and Scripture within systematic theology.
