### TITLE
First Things (journal), founding editor Richard John Neuhaus

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Founded 1990 by Richard John Neuhaus amid late-20th-century debates over secularism, pluralism, and public morals in the United States.
 - Emerged from conservative Catholic intellectual revival and ecumenical networks; positioned at the intersection of academy, church, and public life.
 - Responds to the legal and cultural trajectory traced in Neuhaus's earlier work, especially The Naked Public Square (1984).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Religious convictions must be legitimate, intelligible contributors to public discourse; the exclusion of religious argument from the public square impoverishes democratic moral reasoning.
 - Problem addressed: how a plural democratic polity orders itself when moral and metaphysical commitments diverge-especially whether the state may require a religion-free public reason.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Institutional: establish a durable platform (journal) for "public theology" that brings authoritative theological and philosophical voices into civic debate.
 - Intellectual: critique of secular liberalism that envisions a "naked public square" by insisting religion has a rational public place; defense of natural-law informed moral claims.
 - Practical: marshal doctrinal, historical, and philosophical resources to address concrete public issues (abortion, family, education, religious liberty) while resisting both theocracy and privatization of faith.
 - Programmatic: promote an ecumenical conservative consensus capable of shaping policy through persuasive argument rather than legal coercion alone.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Critiques of liberal secularists influenced by Rawlsian public reason, and of radical separationist readings of Jefferson.
 - Dialogues with Catholic thinkers (John Courtney Murray), Protestant public intellectuals (Niebuhric skeptics and conservative theologians), and contemporary philosophers (natural law proponents).
 - Contributors and interlocutors include conservative academics and church leaders across denominational lines.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Political theology and ecclesiology (role of the church in public life).
 - Natural law and moral anthropology (grounds for public moral claims).
 - Religious liberty (freedom to speak and to organize).
 - Indirect engagement with doctrines of revelation and sin as resources for public moral discourse.

- **Closing line**
 - First Things enjoins a public theology that refuses both privatized piety and theocracy: religion has a rightful, formative voice in the political order, offering moral grammar necessary for a humane polity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Promotes an **ecumenical conservatism**: doctrinally rooted religious claims advanced across denominational lines for shared moral ends.
 - Advocates for **religion as public reason**-not ruling but morally formative-countering the privatization of faith.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Rawlsian and Jeffersonian strictures by arguing that excluding theological reasons from public argument is itself a substantive, contestable moral stance.
 - Distinguishes its position from theocracy: endorses persuasion and moral suasion, not clerical rule.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and institutionalized the language of the "public square" critique and the phraseology around "religion and public life."
 - Helped cement "public theology" as both an academic label and a practical program.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence among conservative Catholic and Protestant intellectuals and policy advocates; shaped debates in U.S. religious politics from the 1990s onward.
 - Criticized by secular liberals for blurring church/state boundaries and by some progressives for aligning with conservative political agendas.
 - Endured as a hub for cross-disciplinary, confessional engagement with civic issues.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how a confessional voice can engage plural democratic institutions without succumbing to clericalism.
 - Remains a primary source for studying late-20th/early-21st century debates about religion's public role.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **First Things (journal)**: institutional forum for public theology and religiously informed cultural critique.
- **Naked public square**: Neuhaus's shorthand for a civic order that bans or marginalizes religious speech from public discourse.
- **Public theology**: theological reflection and argument addressed explicitly to civic audiences and policy deliberation.
- **Natural law**: philosophical-theological resource invoked to ground universal moral claims in public debate.
- **Religious liberty**: defended both as freedom to worship and freedom to participate in civic argumentation.
- **Ecumenical conservatism**: cross-denominational alliance around shared moral priorities and public engagement.
- **Public reason (religious variant)**: claim that religiously grounded reasons can be admissible and persuasive in political deliberation.
- **Moral consensus**: aspiration for a common ethical framework rooted in religious and civic traditions to sustain social order.
- **Theonomy vs. persuasion**: clarified distinction-emphasis on persuasion, not imposition of a religious legal order.
- **Civil society**: domain where churches and associations mediate between individual conscience and the state.
- **Privatization of faith**: criticized tendency to relegate religion to the private sphere, making public discourse secular-only.
- **Christian witness in polity**: practical term for how churches should engage law, policy, and culture.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "public theology" and arguments for religion's public legitimacy.
 - As a **polemic** against strict separationist or secularist positions that exclude theological discourse.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and debates on church-state relations-modeling confessional engagement without advocating theocracy.
