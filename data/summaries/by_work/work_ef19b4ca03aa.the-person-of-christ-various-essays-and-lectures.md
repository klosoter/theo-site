### TITLE
**The Person of Christ** - Herman Bavinck (essays and lectures; compiled reflections on Christology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Turn of the 20th century Dutch Reformed theology. Bavinck writes within a post-Enlightenment, confessional Reformed milieu that seeks to recover classical dogma against liberalizing tendencies and new philosophical pressures. He writes as a historically informed systematician, dialoguing with Chalcedonian orthodoxy and contemporary proposals (notably kenotic theories).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To vindicate the classical doctrine of the **hypostatic union**-the personal unity of the divine Son with two distinct natures-while showing how the incarnation involves a genuine self-limitation of the Son without ontological subtraction of the divine nature.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Affirm the Chalcedonian grammar: one Person (hypostasis) in two complete, unconfused, indivisible natures (divine and human).
 - Clarify the categories: distinguish **nature (natura)** from **person (persona/hypostasis)** and insist that attributes belong to the nature but are appropriated to the person.
 - Treat the **communication of idioms (communicatio idiomatum)**: explanation of how properties of each nature are ascribed to the one person without mingling essences.
 - Diagnose contemporary alternatives (especially **kenosis theories**): show that ontological kenosis (divestment of divine attributes) undermines deity and soteriology; defend a moral/functional self-limitation model whereby the Son does not cease to be God but voluntarily refrains from the independent exercise of some divine prerogatives.
 - Ground Christology in Scripture, patristic and Reformed tradition; proceed from historical theology to dogmatic formulation and pastoral consequences (atonement, revelation, offices).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Phil 2; John), patristic expositors (Athanasius, Gregory), Chalcedon, Augustine, Reformed scholastic sources, and contemporary critics/proponents of kenotic Christology. Bavinck interacts with modern theological currents that press for a re-interpretation of Philippians 2.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology centrally; with implications for Trinity (economic and immanent), revelation, soteriology (atonement and obedience), anthropology (true humanity of Christ), and sacramental/office theology.
- **Closing line:** Bavinck locates the theological center of gravity in a robust Chalcedonian Christology: the Son is fully God and fully man in one person, whose incarnation entails voluntary, functional self-limitation (not ontological loss) so that divine and human properties cohere without confusion or division.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on metaphysical distinctions (nature vs person) married to pastoral and exegetical sensitivity; Bavinck refuses simplistic reductions of the incarnation either to mere moral example or to metaphysical fusion.
 - Nuanced defence of voluntary self-limitation: the Son "empties" himself in action and function, not by ceasing to possess divine attributes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit corrective to **kenotic Christologies** that posit an ontological diminution of deity (see Kenosis Theories And Critiques). Bavinck argues these jeopardize the atonement and mediatorial efficacy.
 - Reorients modern theological sympathy for dynamic history toward the metaphysical and confessional categories of Chalcedon and classical Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Precise deployment of communicatio idiomatum and rearticulation of "kenosis" as moral/functional rather than ontological-retaining classical terms but reinterpreting them to meet modern questions.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly received in Reformed academia as a canonical statement of orthodox Christology in the modern era; widely used in continental and Anglo contexts as a learned synthesis between patristic/medieval categories and modern philosophical critique.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Serves as a model for defending classical Christology against modern revisionism, for integrating historical theology with systematic reasoning, and for teaching the interplay of Trinity, incarnation, and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of two complete natures (divine and human) in the one hypostasis of the Son; central thesis defended.
- **Persona / Hypostasis:** The personal subject (the Son) who subsists and appropriates the attributes of both natures.
- **Natura (Nature):** The ontological principle (what is); Christ has two natures, each with its own properties.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The ascription of the properties of each nature to the one person without confusion or change of essences.
- **Kenosis:** "Emptying" of the Son in incarnation.
 - **Ontological kenosis:** A divestment of divine attributes (rejected by Bavinck).
 - **Moral/functional kenosis:** Voluntary self-limitation in action and prerogative (endorsed as coherent with Chalcedon).
- **Economic Trinity:** How the triune persons act in salvation history; Bavinck ties incarnation to the Son's role in the economy without altering immanent deity.
- **Communicatio idiomatum vs. communicatio idiomatum limited:** Distinguishes proper ascription to the person from any collapse of natures.
- **Divine attributes (communicable/ incommunicable):** Bavinck affirms preservation of incommunicable attributes (e.g., omnipresence) while explaining their functional non-manifestation in the incarnation.
- **Twofold obedience:** Christ's active and passive obedience rooted in his twofold nature and personal unity.
- **Chalcedonian formula:** The standard summary Bavinck repeatedly appeals to and explicates.
- **Christ's self-limitation:** The theological device that preserves deity while explaining incarnational humility.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for a conservative, Reformed articulation of the hypostatic union.
- As a **polemic** and exegetical resource against ontological kenosis and modern reductions of deity.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Philippians 2 and the Johannine Christology within systematic theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking incarnation to soteriology (atonement, offices) without sacrificing metaphysical clarity.
