### TITLE
Counterfeit Miracles - B. B. Warfield (Princeton; early 20th century essays on miracles and the Spirit)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Princeton Reformed theological milieu, late 19th - early 20th century; reaction to rise of spiritualism, revivalist sensationalism, and the emergent Pentecostal movement (Azusa Street, 1906). Warfield writes as a conservative evangelical-apologist defending classical Protestant dogmatics and historical-critical standards against popular charismatic claims and naïve supernaturalism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Claims of contemporary "miracles" and ecstatic phenomena must be rigorously tested; many alleged modern signs are counterfeit (fraudulent, psychological, or demonic) and cannot be allowed to overwrite the normative, apostolically-attested role of miracles as authenticating revelation. In particular, the so-called separable "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" claimed as a post-conversion charismatic experience (tongues, ecstatic manifestations) is a misreading of Scripture.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define what constitutes a genuine miracle and its theological role (authentication of revelation, apostolic authority).
 - Survey modern phenomena (spiritualism, revivalist manifestations, tongues, trances) and demonstrate common non-divine explanations (fraud, suggestion, hysteria, demonic imitation).
 - Establish criteria for discerning authenticity: historical attestation, apostolic connection, conformity to Scripture, moral/Christ-centered fruit, and exclusion of naturalistic or fraudulent causes.
 - Apply criteria to Pentecostal/charismatic claims, arguing that Spirit-baptism as separate from regeneration lacks biblical warrant and that tongues are not normative signs for the church post-apostolic age.
 - Conclude with pastoral and ecclesial cautions: restraint, testing, and obedience to canonical revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages implicitly and explicitly with revival leaders, Pentecostal pioneers (Parham, early Azusa proponents), spiritualists, and contemporary skeptics. Draws on Scripture, Reformed dogmatics (Calvinian pneumatology), historical theology (apostolic era data), and empirical observations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (Baptism of the Holy Spirit, gifts), revelation and canon, soteriology (union with Christ, regeneration), ecclesiology (authority of the apostolic church), demonology (demonic imitation), epistemology (criteria for religious truth).
- **Closing line:** Warfield centers the debate on the integrity of revelation: genuine miracles are apostolic credentials tied to authoritative revelation and covenant-historical purposes, whereas modern sensational phenomena must be tested and generally subordinated to the scriptural norm that locates Spirit-baptism in union with Christ at conversion rather than as a detachable charismatic second experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous, quasi-historical-empirical method applied to theological discernment: miracles judged by historical attestation and causal exclusion as well as doctrinal fit.
 - Strong link between miracles and the authority of revelation - miracles primarily function to authenticate revelation, not to supply ongoing private revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects revivalist/enthusiastic views that privilege present sensational experience as normative or as equal to apostolic revelation.
 - Contrasts with Pentecostal claims by reasserting cessationist tendencies: sign gifts served a foundational, apostolic role and are not normative for ecclesial authority today.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinction between "genuine" and "counterfeit" miracles framed in theological-epistemic terms rather than merely empirical fraudulence.
 - Emphasis on the criterion of apostolic attestation as decisive for accepting extraordinary phenomena as revelatory.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among conservative Reformed and classical cessationist circles as a standard polemic and methodological model.
 - Criticized and largely rejected by Pentecostal and charismatic scholars who argue for normative continuation of charismata and alternative hermeneutics of Acts and Paul.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models disciplined theological skepticism toward religious experience while providing positive criteria for discerning authentic spiritual phenomena.
 - Serves as a compact defense of Reformed pneumatology and a historical-theological baseline in debates over ongoing charismatic gifts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Counterfeit miracles:** Phenomena resembling divine acts but explained by fraud, psychological suggestion, or demonic power; Warfield's central category for many modern displays.
- **Genuine miracles:** Acts of God that authenticate prophetic/apostolic revelation and cannot be subsumed under natural causation.
- **Authentication of revelation:** The theological role Warfield assigns to miracles - to bear witness to Scripture and apostolic authority.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit:** Warfield's normative reading: coincident with regeneration/union with Christ at conversion, not a distinct post-conversion ecstatic experience.
 - Contrasts with Pentecostal "second blessing" formulation.
- **Tongues (glossolalia):** Treated skeptically; not accepted as normative apostolic sign for post-apostolic church without apostolic attestation.
- **Apostolic age (criteria):** The period in which miracles functioned as canonical credentials; post-apostolic continuation is suspect without same attestation.
- **Demonic imitation:** The idea that evil spirits can mimic signs, requiring discernment beyond surface phenomenology.
- **Historical attestation:** A deciding criterion - miracles need reliable historical linkage to apostolic revelation.
- **Subjective religious experience:** Treated as unreliable alone; must be subordinated to objective scriptural norms.
- **Cessationism (implicit):** The theological posture that certain revelatory sign gifts ceased with the apostolic foundation.
- **Epistemic test:** Warfield's methodological toolbox - scriptural conformity, moral fruit, historical evidence, exclusion of natural causes.
- **Sanctifying work vs. sign-giving:** Distinguishes ordinary Spirit-work (regeneration, sanctification) from extraordinary sign-gifts.
- **Revelation vs. private manifestation:** Emphasizes closed canon and guards against private experiences being equated with apostolic revelation.
- **Pastoral caution:** Warfield's practical injunction to churches to test and restrain sensational claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source and apologetic standard for **cessationism** and anti-Pentecostal polemic.
- As an **exegetical and methodological model** for testing alleged miracles (historical/epistemic criteria).
- As a conceptual pivot in pneumatology courses to contrast **union-with-Christ regeneration** with later charismatic second-experience models.
