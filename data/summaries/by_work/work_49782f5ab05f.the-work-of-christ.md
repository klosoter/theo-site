### TITLE
The Work of Christ (anonymous / composite Reformed treatise)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Likely post-Reformation Reformed milieu synthesizing patristic, scholastic, and Protestant materials; compiled for seminary or catechetical use. Reflects engagement with 16th-18th century confessional debates while absorbing 19th-20th century biblical-theological emphasis on typology and new-creation language.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ's one work (united active and passive obedience, death, resurrection, ascension, and present mediatorial reign) accomplishes both satisfaction for sin and the communication of covenantal benefits to God's people - effected objectively in history and subjectively applied through union with Christ, the Spirit, Word, and sacraments.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of the person of Christ (hypostatic union, two natures, offices).
 - The economy of redemption: active obedience, passive obedience (atonement), resurrection and exaltation.
 - Application: union with Christ, justification, sanctification, adoption, and glorification.
 - Means of application: Word, sacraments, Spirit; corporate and ecclesial dimensions.
 - Eschatological consummation: resurrection as first-fruits and new-creation inauguration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Patristic theologians (notably Augustine), Anselmian and scholastic categories (satisfaction, merit), Reformation sources (Calvinic covenant and forensic categories), later Reformed sacramental theology, and biblical exegesis emphasizing typology (OT types fulfilled in Christ).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (canon and tradition), Trinity, Christology (person and offices), Atonement theories, Covenant theology, Justification, Adoption, Sanctification, Sacraments as means of grace, Ecclesiology (Reformation perspective), Resurrection and eschatology (new creation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The work centers on **Christ as covenantal mediator** whose historical accomplishment and present mediatorial activity secure both the objective merits of redemption and their covenantal application to sinners through union, Word, sacrament, and Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates multiple atonement motifs (penal substitution, satisfaction, Christus Victor, and representative obedience) without reducing the work to a single model.
 - Strong covenantal framing: Christ's work is described primarily in terms of covenant union and federal headship rather than merely legal forensic categories.
 - Elevates typology and fulfillment: OT sacrificial and covenantal types are treated as intrinsic to Christ's historical work and to sacramental theology.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects an exclusively Anselmian/legal account by insisting on corporate and cosmic dimensions (victory over sin and death; restoration of creation).
 - Counters purely subjective or mystical readings by underscoring objective historical accomplishment and ecclesial means of grace.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Uses an "economy of mediation" vocabulary that fuses active/passive obedience language with covenantal exchange (Christ's righteousness imputed; believers' union-imparted life).
 - Describes sacraments as "historical-signal instruments" - they both signify fulfilled typological realities and instrumentally convey grace through ordained means.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in confessional Reformed seminaries for its synthetic explanatory power; cited as a concise model for teaching Christology-soteriology integration.
 - Influential in debates over sacramental efficacy and justification in contexts seeking a balance between forensic and covenantal emphases.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact pedagogical synthesis of Christ's work across loci (Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, eschatology).
 - Useful as a corrective bridge between classical Reformed dogmatics and recent biblical-theological emphases on typology and new creation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement / Satisfaction:** Christ's death as both legal satisfaction and decisive victory over sin; reconciliatory and substitutionary dimensions affirmed.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** Christ's life fulfilled law's demands (active); death bore penalty for sin (passive); both necessary for justification and sanctification.
- **Union with Christ:** The central nexus for application; believers share in Christ's death, resurrection, and righteousness by mystical/forensic union.
- **Federal Headship / Covenant Exchange:** Christ as representative head whose obedience is imputed to the elect and whose benefits are communicated covenantally.
- **Justification (forensic) and Sanctification (participatory):**
 - Justification: declarative, forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness.
 - Sanctification: progressive participation in Christ's life via the Spirit and means.
- **Adoption:** Receiving covenantal status as children; linked to Christ's exaltation and sending of the Spirit.
- **Typology & Fulfillment:** OT types (sacrifices, priests, kings, covenants) find fulfillment in Christ; informs sacramental reading of Scripture.
- **Sacraments as Means of Grace:** Word-bound, church-administered instruments that actually convey covenantal realities (not merely signs).
- **Faith and Repentance:** Properly ordered responses enabled by the Spirit; conditions for receiving applied benefits.
- **Canon and Tradition:** Scripture is normative; tradition functions hermeneutically in preserving typological and sacramental interpretation.
- **Resurrection and New Creation:** Resurrection as first-fruits inaugurating cosmic redemption and final glorification.
- **Ecclesiology (Reformation):** Church as covenantal community where Christ's work is received publicly and sacramentally.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for integrated Christology-soteriology (teaching and confessional summaries).
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist atonement theories or sacramental minimalism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading OT types and NT fulfillment together in preaching and sacramental practice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking doctrine of God, Christ, and the church to pastoral ministry and eschatology.
