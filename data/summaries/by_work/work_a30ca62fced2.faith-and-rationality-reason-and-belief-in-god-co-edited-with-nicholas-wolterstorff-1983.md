### TITLE
Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God (co-edited with Nicholas Wolterstorff, 1983) - Alvin Plantinga (contribution and editorial context)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1980s analytic theology and epistemology; reaction against dominant evidentialist and classical foundationalist accounts of religious belief.
 - Volume edited by Plantinga and Wolterstorff gathers analytic philosophers and theologians addressing whether belief in God can be rational without propositional evidence.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Faith (belief in God) can be rational, properly held, and epistemically permissible even when it is not the product of inferential evidence - challenging the evidentialist demand that rational belief requires sufficient argument or evidence.
 - The core doctrinal problem: How can Christian belief be epistemically respectable without collapsing into either fideism or evidentialist apologetics?
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Critique of evidentialism: the evidentialist principle (that beliefs are rational only if appropriately supported by evidence) is shown to be too strict and self-defeating when applied to itself.
 - Defence of non-inferential religious belief: introduces and defends the idea that belief in God can be **properly basic** - analogous to basic perceptual, memory, and introspective beliefs.
 - Appeal to a natural theological psychology: humans may possess a **sensus divinitatis** or cognitive faculty that produces belief in God under proper conditions.
 - Handling of defeaters and epistemic challenges: acknowledges need to answer defeaters and distinguishes between rationality and warrant (prefiguring later developments).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: evidentialists (representatives of Cliffordian and classical empiricist lines), analytic philosophers of religion contemporary to Plantinga and Wolterstorff.
 - Engages classical Reformed themes (Calvinist sensus divinitatis) and analytic epistemology (foundationalism, internalism/externalism).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and religious epistemology (experiential and non-inferential access to God).
 - Epistemic status of faith; theological anthropology (cognitive faculties oriented to God).
 - Less attention to systematic dogmatics (Trinity, Christology) - focus is epistemological and apologetical.
- **Closing line**
 - The work's theological center: **Christian belief is epistemically respectable as non-inferential, properly basic belief grounded in divinely oriented cognitive capacities, resisting both fideistic voluntarism and strict evidentialism.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rehabilitates the doctrineally resonant idea that belief in God can be *properly basic*, giving Calvinist intuitions an analytic epistemological framework.
 - Marries Reformed theological motifs (sensus divinitatis) with analytic notions of basic belief to create a non-evidentialist apologetic.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges evidentialists (e.g., Cliffordian strictures) by arguing that their standard is self-undermining and unnecessary for rational belief.
 - Differs from fideism by insisting beliefs produced appropriately by cognitive faculties are rational - not mere voluntary commitments.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the phrase and programmatic approach later labeled **Reformed epistemology**.
 - Clear separation of **rationality** (permissibility) from later, more technical notion of **warrant** (developed more fully in Plantinga's subsequent work).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed a major shift in philosophy of religion and theology; legitimized non-evidentialist approaches in academic discourse.
 - Provoked detailed rejoinders from evidentialists and spurred extensive literature on religious epistemology (internalist vs externalist debates).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for defending religious belief within analytic epistemology and for integrating Reformed theological commitments with philosophical rigor.
 - Remains central in teaching debates on faith and reason, influencing apologetics, systematic theology, and Christian higher education.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Properly basic belief** - Beliefs rationally held without inferential support (e.g., perceptual beliefs); central claim that belief in God can belong here.
- **Sensus divinitatis** - A God-oriented cognitive capacity (theological antecedent) that can yield basic belief in God under proper conditions.
- **Evidentialism** - The view that rational belief requires sufficient evidence; primary target of critique in the volume.
- **Foundationalism** - Epistemic theory about basic beliefs; Plantinga critiques narrow versions that exclude religious belief from basics.
- **Internalism vs. Externalism** - Background epistemic dispute influencing how justification is construed; Plantinga's approach favors an externalist-friendly reading (cognitive faculties and proper functioning).
- **Defeater / defeasible rationality** - Recognition that basic belief can be rational yet overturned by defeaters (counterevidence or undermining factors).
- **Rationality vs. Warrant** - Distinction stressed: the book argues for rational permissibility; Plantinga would later formalize warrant as a separate technical property.
- **Cognitive faculties / proper function (prefiguration)** - Early appeal to properly functioning faculties in an appropriate environment aimed at truth (conceptual seed of later proper-function account).
- **Non-inferential justification** - Justification that does not rely on argument or evidence chains; used to defend experiential religious belief.
- **Religious experience / testimony** - Considered as sources of non-inferential warrant; placed within a broader epistemic ecology.
- **Theological anthropology** - Implicit claim that humans are epistemically oriented toward God.
- **Apologetic pivot** - The volume serves as a pivot from evidential to warrant-based and non-evidential apologetics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed epistemology and the category of properly basic religious belief.
- As a **polemic** against evidentialist apologetics and strict foundationalism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Reformed theological resources (sensus divinitatis) with analytic epistemology for use in apologetics, systematic theology, and the philosophy of religion.
