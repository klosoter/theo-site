### TITLE
Transhumanism and Transcendence: Christian Hope in an Age of Technological Enhancement - Ronald Cole-Turner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century debate at the intersection of bioethics, theology, and the rising transhumanist movement. Addresses rapid advances in biotechnology, AI, life-extension research, and the popular optimism of techno-utopian thinkers.
 - Theological milieu: constructive Christian ethics informed by classical doctrines (creation, fall, redemption, eschatology) and contemporary philosophical engagement with posthumanist thought.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Transhumanism presents a secular, technological version of hope that seeks to overcome human limits by technical means. Christian theology must resist equating technological enhancement with true transcendence and instead reframe human destiny in terms of **divine-centered hope** rather than self-directed technosoteriology.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: characterizes transhumanism as an influential cultural movement promising bodily immortality, enhanced cognition, and moral progress through technology.
 - Theological critique: shows how transhumanism functions as a replacement eschatology (a "techno-salvation") that misreads human nature, ignores sin, and misconstrues flourishing.
 - Constructive alternative: articulates a Christian ethic that affirms responsible scientific inquiry while insisting on limits grounded in creation, the imago Dei, embodied relationality, and eschatological hope.
 - Practical policy and moral guidance: proposes principles for assessing enhancement technologies (stewardship, solidarity, humility, and precaution).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with transhumanist advocates and literature (technophiles and futurists), bioethical scholarship, and contemporary theological resources (classical Christian doctrine, ethicists, and theologians in science-and-religion dialogue).
 - Dialogues with secular bioethics frameworks and cultural critiques of technologized human identity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** and creatureliness (limits and giftedness)
 - **Imago Dei** (human dignity, relationality)
 - **Anthropology** (embodiment, personhood, finitude)
 - **Sin and fall** (hubris, alienation)
 - **Redemption and eschatology** (true transcendence as eschatological gift)
 - **Providence and stewardship** (ethics of technological development)

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - True transcendence is not achieved by technical mastery over our nature but by entering into the eschatological redemption God gives; Christian hope redirects enhancement ethics from self-exaltation to faithful stewardship of embodied, relational life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes **contrast between technological transcendence and theological transcendence**: the former as self-directed overcoming of limits, the latter as God-directed fulfillment of creaturely ends.
 - Stresses **embodied relationality**: human identity is constituted by embodied relations, not merely by information patterns or capacities that can be upgraded.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against both uncritical techno-optimism and technophobic rejection by offering a middle path-critical engagement rather than wholesale embrace or condemnation.
 - Corrects secular bioethics that treats enhancement solely as autonomy and utility, by reintroducing theological categories like vocation, sin, and eschatological telos.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames transhumanism as a form of **technosoteriology** (technology-as-salvation) to highlight its quasi-religious function.
 - Advocates a **theology of limits**: limits are not mere obstacles but loci of dependence, humility, and moral formation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in theological bioethics and science-faith conversations as a balanced Christian critique of enhancement culture.
 - Influential among ethicists seeking theological resources to evaluate human enhancement; less adopted by hardline secular transhumanists.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a clear, teachable framework for addressing contemporary techno-ethical dilemmas from a Christian standpoint.
 - Useful as a model of theological engagement with technological culture: diagnostic, normative, and pastoral.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Transhumanism** - movement advocating enhancement of human capacities through technology; critical interlocutor throughout the work.
- **Transcendence (theological)** - eschatological fulfillment given by God; contrasted with technological "overcoming" of limits.
- **Technosoteriology** - the framing of technology as a means to salvation or ultimate human destiny.
- **Imago Dei** - grounds human dignity and limits; shapes criteria for permissible enhancements.
- **Embodiment** - emphasis on bodily integrity and relational identity against disembodied conceptions of personhood.
- **Finitude** - human limits as theological goods, not merely deficits to be eliminated.
- **Stewardship** - ethical principle for responsible scientific use and regulation.
- **Eschatological hope** - ultimate telos for humanity that resists substitution by technological immortality.
- **Personhood** - theological and ethical account resisting reduction to information-processing or utility.
- **Autonomy vs. solidarity** - critique of enhancement rhetoric centered on radical autonomy; calls for communal, justice-minded evaluation.
- **Precautionary ethic** - prudential stance toward uncertain and far-reaching enhancement technologies.
- **Relationality** - social and covenantal dimensions of human identity that technologies must respect.
- **Moral formation** - concern that enhancements may short-circuit character-building and repentance.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological critique of transhumanism and the concept of technosoteriology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ethics courses to contrast secular enhancement paradigms with a doctrine-shaped moral vision.
 - As a **pedagogical model** for integrating classical doctrines (imago Dei, eschatology) into contemporary bioethical debates.
