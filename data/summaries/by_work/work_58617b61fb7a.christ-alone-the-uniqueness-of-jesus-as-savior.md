### TITLE
Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior 
Author: Unknown (anonymous tract/essay) 
Tradition: Strongly Christocentric, broadly Reformed-evangelical in orientation

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Likely placed within late 20th-21st century evangelical/Reformed debates emphasizing sola Christus against pluralism, Roman Catholicism, and liberal theologies. Functions as a corrective tract in confessional circles and a catechetical summary for churches reasserting Christological exclusivity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Jesus is the sole, sufficient, and exclusive Savior; every covenantal promise and soteriological demand of Scripture finds its decisive fulfillment in his person and work.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Opening claim: biblical data and the apostles affirm the exclusive mediatorship of Christ (Acts, Pauline corpus, Hebrews). 
 - Diagnosis: modern errors-religious pluralism, moralism, works-righteousness-misread covenantal and moral law functions. 
 - Theological apparatus: deploys covenant theology to show continuity of God's single plan and Christ as covenant head; uses the law-gospel distinction to locate law as diagnostic and gospel as remedial. 
 - Exposition: Christ's incarnation, active and passive obedience, penal substitutionary atonement, resurrection, and ascension effect justification, imputation, and union with Christ. 
 - Pastoral application: exclusive call to faith in Christ, warnings against syncretism and confidence in law-works.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Scripture (Old and New Testaments) as primary; engages classic Reformers (implicit Reformation categories), contemporary defenders of penal substitution and covenantal hermeneutics. Opposes views of pluralists, liberal theologians, and sacramental/merit-based soteriology in Roman Catholicism.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation, Christology (person and work), Trinity (mediatorial Son), soteriology (justification, atonement, imputation), covenant theology (unity and fulfillment), law and gospel distinction, ecclesiology (ordinances as Christ-wards), and assurance.
- **Closing line (theological center):** 
 - Salvation is found in no other; Christ alone is the covenant head, mediator, and sufficient Savior - all Scripture's promises converge in him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong articulation of Christ as the definitive fulfillment of all biblical covenants - not merely a moral exemplar but the covenantal head whose person effects covenantal change for his people. 
 - Integrates law-gospel methodology systematically: law convicts covenant subjects; gospel secures covenant blessings in Christ alone.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects Roman Catholic emphases on cooperation and infused righteousness by reiterating imputed righteousness and the single-medicator principle. 
 - Pushes back against pluralistic theology by affirming exclusive biblical claims rather than relativizing salvation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Adopts a compact term such as **"Christ-as-Covenant-Sum"** (implicit) to denote that Christ embodies and secures the covenantal promises rather than being only one covenantal actor among many.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical catechesis and preaching as a concise resource for defending sola Christus. Used less in critical academic circles lacking confessional commitments, but influential in pastoral and polemical contexts.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Provides a clear, useable synthesis linking covenant theology and the law-gospel distinction to Christocentric soteriology - durable for preaching, catechesis, and polemical engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Solus Christus:** Christ alone is mediator and Savior; no human mediator or sacrament supplants him. 
- **Mediator / One Mediator:** Christ as exclusive intermediary between God and sinners (1 Tim 2:5 hermeneutic). 
- **Covenant fulfillment:** All prior covenants find their consummation and legal/typological fulfillment in Jesus. 
 - Relation to Biblical Covenants: reads Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic covenants typologically and substantively in Christ-as-head.
- **Law-Gospel distinction:** 
 - Law: reveals sin and obligation; Gospel: announces pardon and gift of Christ's righteousness. 
 - Used diagnostically (law) and restoratively (gospel) to avoid moralism or antinomianism.
- **Penal substitution / Satisfaction:** Christ bears penalty deserved by sinners; his suffering satisfies divine justice. 
- **Imputation (active & passive obedience):** Christ's righteousness credited to believers and his obedience secures covenant blessing. 
- **Union with Christ:** The believer's salvation is relationally grounded in mystical/forensic union with the Mediator. 
- **Justification by faith alone:** Forensic declaration grounded on Christ's finished work, not on human merit. 
- **Exclusive sufficiency:** Christ's work is both necessary and sufficient for salvation - rejects additions. 
- **Typology:** Old Testament persons/rites point forward to Christ as covenant head and sacrifice. 
- **Ecclesial implications:** Church's preaching, sacraments, and mission must centrally proclaim Christ alone.
- **Exclusivism vs. pluralism:** Affirmative stance that biblical revelation permits no pluralistic equivalence of other saviors.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic:** Scriptural reading that centers Christ as key to covenant revelation and fulfillment.
- **Active/passive obedience:** Distinguishes Christ's life-fulfilling obedience (active) and atoning suffering (passive) for justification.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for Christ-centered soteriology in confessional teaching. 
 - As a **polemic tool** against pluralism and merit-based soteriologies (Roman Catholic or liberal). 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Biblical covenants Christocentrically and for applying the law-gospel distinction in preaching and pastoral care.
