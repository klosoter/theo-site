### TITLE
Addresses on Prophecy (compiled sermons and lectures) - C. I. Scofield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 20th century Anglo‑American evangelical/fundamentalist milieu. Scofield writes as a popular expositor and systematizer of premillennial dispensationalism (consolidated by Darby and the Plymouth Brethren) and reaches a broad audience through sermons, lectures and his later Scofield Reference Bible.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Biblical prophecy must be read by a consistent, literal‑historic hermeneutic that preserves a real future for national Israel and anticipates an imminent, premillennial return of Christ; failure to keep Israel and the Church distinct collapses prophetic expectation into spiritualized fulfillment.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes principles of prophetic interpretation (literal, grammatical, historical; allowance for typology but rejection of wholesale spiritualizing).
 - Applies that hermeneutic to major prophetic loci: Daniel, Ezekiel, Zechariah, the Olivet Discourse, and Revelation.
 - Asserts a dispensational framework: successive divine economies, distinct promises to Israel, and a parenthetical Church age culminating in a pretribulational rapture and a literal millennial kingdom.
 - Concludes with pastoral exhortations: urgency of readiness, evangelistic implications of imminent return, and the political/theological importance of Jewish restoration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Positive debt to J. N. Darby and Darbyite dispensational pioneers.
 - Engages critically with covenant theologians and historicists (theological opponents who spiritualize prophecy), implicitly counters postmillennial and amillennial readings.
 - Later debates with 20th/21st‑century developments such as Progressive Covenantalism are relevant as contrasts (not contemporary with Scofield, but analytically opposed).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (as normative for prophecy), hermeneutics, covenant (as multiple dispensations with distinct promises), eschatology (rapture, tribulation, millennium), Christology (Second Advent and Messianic reign), ecclesiology (Church distinct from Israel), typology vs. predictive prophecy.
- **Closing line:** The work's theological center of gravity is a vigorous, literalist dispensationalism that insists on future, national fulfillment of Israel's promises and an imminent premillennial return of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on a literal, grammatical‑historical reading of prophetic texts combined with a dispensational taxonomy which keeps divine purposes for Israel and the Church separate.
 - Popularization of the notion of the Church age as a temporary "parenthesis" in redemptive history.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects covenantal and historicist hermeneutics that spiritualize Israel into the Church (countering Reformed and Roman Catholic readings).
 - Opposes postmillennial optimism and amillennial denial of a literal millennium.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of the term "dispensation" in popular ministry contexts; framing prophecy so that promises to Israel are future and literal.
 - Emphasis on "mystery" of the Church as a previously unrevealed dispensation (in harmony with Pauline vocabulary).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in American fundamentalism and popular evangelicalism; key resource for Christian Zionism and conservative prophecy movements.
 - Criticized by Reformed, Anglican, and progressive covenantal scholars for its discontinuity model, alleged overliteralism, and poor handling of covenant continuity and typology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable as a clear statement of classical dispensational hermeneutic and popular prophetic exegesis; indispensable for understanding 20th‑century evangelical eschatology and the socio‑political theological roots of Christian Zionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensationalism:** Division of redemptive history into distinct administrations with differing divine expectations and promises.
- **Premillennialism:** Christ returns bodily before a literal 1000‑year earthly reign.
- **Pretribulational Rapture:** The Church is removed from earth prior to the seven‑year tribulation (Scofield's favored chronology).
- **Literal interpretation:** Grammatico‑historical reading that prefers plain sense fulfillment, especially for prophetic promises.
- **Israel/Church distinction:** Theological partition that reserves national promises (land, throne, covenant) for ethnic Israel apart from the Church.
- **Tribulation:** A future period of divine judgment preceding the millennial kingdom, distinct from present trials.
- **Millennium (millennial kingdom):** A literal, earthly reign of Christ centered in Jerusalem.
- **"Parenthesis" of the Church:** The church age as an interlude between prophetic programs for Israel.
- **"Mystery" (ecclesial):** Pauline category employed to explain the previously unrevealed planning of the Church age.
- **Typology vs. predictive prophecy:** Allows typological foreshadowing but insists on literal future fulfillments where prophecy indicates them.
- **Futurism (Revelation/Daniel):** Interpreting major apocalyptic passages as primarily future events rather than past or spiritualized realities.
- **Kingdom of God (earthly):** Distinct from the inaugurated, spiritual reign-here anticipated as a visible, political kingdom for Israel.
- **Covenant promises (particularity):** Promises to Abraham, David, and Israel as enduring and to be fulfilled literally.
- **Imminence:** The belief that Christ's return may occur at any moment, motivating urgent evangelism and holiness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classical dispensational hermeneutics and popular eschatological categories.
- As a **polemic** against covenant theology and progressive covenantal readings that emphasize continuity and realized/inaugurated eschatology.
- As an **exegetical model** for literalist readings of Daniel, Ezekiel, Revelation and prophetic Old Testament texts; often cited in pastoral teaching and in constructing timelines of end‑time events.
