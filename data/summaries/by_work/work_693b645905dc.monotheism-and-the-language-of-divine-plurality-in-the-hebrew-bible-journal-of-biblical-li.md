### TITLE
Monotheism and the Language of Divine Plurality in the Hebrew Bible. Benjamin D. Sommer. Journal of Biblical Literature 2008.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Scholarly biblical studies and history of Israelite religion in the early 21st century; addresses philological, literary, and historical debates about Israelite monotheism, divine plurality language, and implications for Christian trinitarian readings of the OT.
 - Engages the growing literature on the divine council, Canaanite backgrounds, and grammatical analyses of plurality in biblical Hebrew.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Hebrew Bible is monotheistic yet regularly uses language that presents a *plurality within divine speech and imagery*; this plurality is plural in form/function but should not be read simply as polytheism or as direct OT support for later Trinitarian formulations.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of key textual loci (e.g., Genesis 1:26 "Let us make", Elohim grammatical issues, bene elohim / divine council passages, Elyon constructions).
 - Distinguishes types of plurality-language and assigns different semantic/pragmatic functions:
 - **Deliberative/plural of consultation** (e.g., "let us" as internal deliberation).
 - **Plural of majesty / emphatic plural** (grammatical/formal uses that do not indicate multiple divine persons).
 - **Council/plural as vestige of earlier divine assemblies** (divine council language reinterpreted within monotheism).
 - Argues for a model of **monotheism that permits pluriform divine language** without collapsing into polytheism or requiring anachronistic trinitarian readings.
 - Uses philology, comparative ancient Near Eastern materials, and theological-historical reasoning to map continuity and change in Israelite discourse about God.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with scholarship on Canaanite religion and Israelite monotheism (e.g., Mark S. Smith), work on divine council and heavenly assembly (e.g., Michael S. Heiser), and linguistic/grammatical commentators on Hebrew plurality.
 - Draws on primary biblical texts, comparative Ugaritic/materials, and modern grammatical theory.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (how God speaks and is represented linguistically), **Trinity** (indirectly, as the article cautions against simple OT support), **monotheism** (definition and boundaries), and **divine ontology/agency** in Scripture.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The biblical witness sustains an orthodox monotheism while tolerating and employing a variety of plural language forms that require nuanced philological and theological interpretation, not simplistic typological readings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Careful typology of plural-language functions (deliberative, majestic, council) rather than a single explanatory category.
 - Integration of fine-grained Hebrew grammatical points with theological consequences.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against readings that treat plural forms as straightforward evidence of residual polytheism or as direct foreshadowings of Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Contrasts with scholars who either flatten all plurality into "grammatical plural" or who over-read divine council language as normative polytheism.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a working vocabulary of **"pluriform monotheism"** (implicit) - i.e., monotheism that includes plural linguistic strategies - and insists on functional, context-sensitive categorization of plural uses.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in biblical-theological and exegetical literature as a corrective to both polemical anti-Trinitarian uses of OT plural language and to naive trinitarian proof-texting.
 - Influential for subsequent treatments of the divine council and for courses on Old Testament theology that emphasize methodological caution.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary methodological model combining philology, comparative study, and theological sensitivity; valuable for pastors, exegetes, and theologians resisting anachronistic readings while making theological use of the OT.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elohim**
 - Grammatically plural form often used with singular verbs for the God of Israel; central to debates about plurality vs. singular reference.

- **"Let us" (Genesis 1:26) / deliberative plural**
 - Interpreted as internal divine deliberation or rhetorical plurals, not necessarily plurality of persons.

- **Plural of majesty (honorific plural)**
 - One proposed function: plural form used to confer dignity; Sommer treats this cautiously and contextually.

- **Divine council / bene elohim ("sons of God")**
 - Language reflecting an assembly motif; Sommer treats as residual or literaryized council imagery assimilated into monotheistic discourse.

- **Elyon + genitive plurals**
 - Constructions (e.g., "gods of the Most High") that must be read with attention to syntactic force and theological context.

- **Monotheism vs. monolatry**
 - Distinguishes doctrinal exclusivity (one God) from historical worship-practices that may have tolerated subordinate divine beings in language.

- **Pluriform monotheism**
 - Working descriptor for Israelite monotheistic discourse that employs plural language without polytheistic commitment.

- **Grammatical vs. semantic plurality**
 - Key analytic move: separate morphological plurality from theological plurality; each instance requires context-sensitive judgment.

- **Polytheistic residue / literary adaptation**
 - Concept describing vestigial language and motifs adapted into a monotheistic framework.

- **Theological hermeneutics**
 - Methodological insistence that theological appropriation of OT language must respect ancient semantic ranges.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading plural divine language with philological nuance.
- As a **polemic resource** against both simplistic OT proofs for the Trinity and against claims that OT plural forms prove unabated polytheism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in defining monotheism historically: it is a go-to source for instructors and authors teaching the complexity of Israelite theological language.
