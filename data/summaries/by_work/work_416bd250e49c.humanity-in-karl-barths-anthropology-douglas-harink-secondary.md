### TITLE
Humanity in Karl Barth's Anthropology (Douglas Harink, secondary): Barthian relational, Christocentric account of human origin, unity, sin, and destiny - with a focused reading of the traducianism vs creationism problem.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post-Reformation, 20th-century theological renewal: Barth's Church Dogmatics (CD) as primary locus; Harink (contemporary Barth scholar) reads Barth against both classical scholastic and modern philosophical anthropology.
 - Milieu: reaction to liberal anthropology, recovery of Reformed dogmatics reframed by Trinitarian and Christological commitments.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth refuses to ground human origin and nature on speculative metaphysics (either classical traducianism or simple creationism) and instead makes human being intelligible only within God's self-revelation in Christ and the covenantal relation.
 - The doctrinal problem: how to account for human generation, soul/body unity, and original sin without reducing theology to metaphysical schemes.
- **Core argument / structure (Harink's reading of Barth)**
 - Critique of metaphysical dualisms: the soul as an independently subsisting substance is rejected; anthropology must avoid naturalistic reduction.
 - Priority of divine act: human existence is primarily a product of God's creative and covenantal address, not a secret ontological inheritance.
 - Christocentric reorientation: human creatureliness and destiny are disclosed and fulfilled in the incarnate Son - the true image and representative of humanity.
 - Ethical and ecclesial consequences: human subjectivity is defined by election, reconciliation, and the Spirit-enabled participation in Christ (not by biological derivation alone).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Barth's direct interlocutors: classical Reformed theologians (tradition on creationism), Lutheran traducian tendencies, modern philosophers of the soul, and patristic/formal scholastic positions.
 - Harink interacts with secondary Barth scholarship aiming to clarify Barth's anthropological commitments.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (creatureliness), Trinity (relational ontology), Christology (incarnation as normative case for humanity), Pneumatology (new life and participation), Election, Original Sin, Eschatology, Covenant.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth (as read by Harink) reframes anthropology: human origin and identity are not metaphysical puzzles to be solved apart from God's self-act in Christ, but relational realities disclosed and governed by the covenantal, redemptive Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Anthropology as primarily relational and covenantal rather than metaphysical or biological.
 - The incarnate Word (Christ) as the normative, normative locus for understanding human nature (theologia crucis applied anthropologically).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects Lutheran and medieval tendencies that make the soul a self-subsistent substance transmissible by parents (classical traducianism).
 - Corrects simple creationism that posits autonomous, immediate creation of distinct souls without locating human existence within God's covenantal address.
 - Pushes back against liberal and naturalistic reductions that secularize personhood.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Shifting emphasis from "soul" as substance to human "being-for-God" and "being-in-Christ."
 - Recasting imago Dei as dynamic, realized in relation and reconciliation rather than an intrinsic set of capacities.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among contemporary Reformed systematicians who seek a Trinitarian/Christological anthropology.
 - Provoked debate: praised for biblical fidelity and theological depth; critiqued by those who want clearer positive statements on soul ontology or empirical biology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust alternative to metaphysical and reductionist anthropologies; fruitfully integrates Christology, election, and eschatology into anthropology.
 - Valuable pedagogically for showing how doctrine transforms basic human questions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Traducianism**
 - Doctrine that the soul (or life principle) is transmitted from parents; Barth (via Harink) critiques its metaphysical assumptions and anthropological reductionism.
- **Creationism (soul-creation)**
 - Classical claim that each soul is directly created by God at conception; Harink shows Barth disputes this as an inadequate standalone account because it divorces origin from covenantal disclosure.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - For Barth/Harink: relational and Christologically fulfilled, not merely a set of faculties.
- **Creatureliness**
 - Stress on human dependency and created status - human identity is given, not self-grounded.
- **Being-for-God**
 - Key anthropological category: personhood defined by relation to God, central to Barth's reorientation.
- **Election**
 - Anthropological pivot: human being is constituted in and by divine election, especially seen in Christ.
- **Incarnation / Christology**
 - Normative paradigm: the Son's humanity defines true humanity and reorients questions about origin and destiny.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Spirit's role in bringing participation in Christ and renewing human existence.
- **Original sin**
 - Treated christologically and covenantally - a corporate reality remedied in reconciliation.
- **Soul / person**
 - Soul is not reified as a separable substance; "person" is relational and covenantal.
- **Eschatology**
 - Human destiny is finalized in the eschatological union with Christ - crucial for anthropology.
- **Covenant**
 - Framework within which origin and identity are spoken; God's address constitutes human reality.
- **Address / Word**
 - God's speaking (and acting) is formative for human being; theology must follow revelation rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a definitional source for a Barthian, anti-metaphysical, Christocentric anthropology.
 - As a polemic resource against both traducianist and creationist foundationalism on the soul.
 - As an exegetical-model and conceptual pivot to integrate doctrine (Trinity, Christology, Pneumatology, eschatology) into systematic anthropology.
