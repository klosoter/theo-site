### TITLE
**The Sacrifice of Praise** - Herman Bavinck (Dutch Reformed; late 19th / early 20th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written within Dutch Neo-Calvinist / confessional Reformed milieu near turn of 20th century. Bavinck addresses modernizing pressures (liberal theology, pietism, ritualism) while articulating a historically Reformed theology of worship and sacraments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - True worship is a spiritual sacrifice offered by the redeemed, and the sacraments function as God-wrought means whereby praise, covenant identity, and union with Christ are both confessed and effected. Worship cannot be divorced from objective redemptive facts (Christ's work) nor from the Spirit-wrought subjective appropriation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern distortions (rationalism, pietistic privatization, sacramental superstition) fracture worship from doctrine.
 - Retrieval: appeal to Scripture, Augustine, Calvin, and Reformed confessions to recover worship as both objective (Christ's accomplished work) and subjective (Spirit's sanctifying work).
 - Sacramental locus: baptism and the Lord's Supper are concrete loci of praise - signs that effect union and signal covenant belonging; they mediate Christ's presence spiritually and secure the believer's participation in the kingdom.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial consequences: proper admission, fencing the table, and catechetical preparation are necessary to preserve covenant integrity and the efficacy of praise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Positive interlocutors: Augustine, Calvin, Reformed confessional standards; contemporaries in Neo-Calvinism (Kuyper) and pastoral theology.
 - Critical interlocutors: Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Arminian/Pelagian tendencies (semi-Pelagian stress on human initiative), modern liberal reductions of worship, and any that collapse sign and thing signified.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant, original sin and grace, justification (forensic imputation), Christology (messianic consciousness and kingdom), Holy Spirit (appropriation), ecclesiology, sacraments (mode, efficacy, presence), baptismal paedobaptism vs credobaptism, Lord's Supper admission and real (spiritual) presence.
- **Closing line**
 - Worship as the "sacrifice of praise" unites objective redemption and Spirit-wrought appropriation: the church offers praise precisely because God has enacted and communally mediates salvation in covenant signs and words.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of *doctrine* and *devotion*: worship must be theologically informed and sacramentally embodied; praise is not mere feeling but covenant response.
 - Balanced sacramental realism: affirms Christ's real presence in the Supper as spiritual, not corporeal, and defends sacramental efficacy without magic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian optimism: underscores total depravity and necessity of sovereign grace for true praise and sacramental fruitfulness.
 - Corrects both Roman superstition (mere physical presence or ex opere operato) and liberal privatization (worship as mere ethics/experience).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recasts worship language using *sacrifice* (borrowed and reshaped) to stress continuity with biblical cultus while reorienting it around Christ's once-for-all atonement.
 - Emphasizes *fencing* and *admission* as pastoral-theological categories to safeguard covenant signs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for integrating dogmatics and piety; used by pastors and systematicians as a model of confessional liturgical theology.
 - Influenced later Reformed sacramental and worship renewal movements that emphasize catechesis, covenant children, and guarded communion.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable corrective to both sacramental minimalism and sacramental superstition; remains a concise resource for teaching on worship, sacraments, and ecclesial discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrifice of praise** - worship framed as covenantal, Spirit-offered thank-offering grounded in Christ's work.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments as instruments through which the Spirit applies redemption; neither purely symbolic nor magically efficacious.
- **Spiritual presence** - Christ present at the Lord's Supper in a real, non-corporeal way appropriated by faith.
- **Fencing the table** - pastoral practice of guarding communion admission to preserve covenant integrity and sacramental fruit.
- **Admission / catechetical preparation** - requirement for worthy reception; links ecclesiology and sacrament.
- **Paedobaptism vs believer baptism** - defense of infant baptism on covenant continuity grounds; baptism marks covenant inclusion and promise.
 - Contrast: Bavinck rejects purely voluntarist/credobaptist reductions that sever covenant continuity.
- **Forensic imputation** - justification remains objective, forensic declaration based on Christ's righteousness credited to believers; counters NPP-style redefinitions that collapse forensic into covenantal participation alone.
- **Total depravity / anti-Pelagianism** - human inability necessitates sovereign grace for genuine worship; critique of semi-Pelagian tendencies.
- **Messianic consciousness / kingdom** - Christ's revealed kingship shapes worship and sacraments; praise proleptically participates in the kingdom.
- **Union with Christ** - central soteriological framework: sacraments signify and confer union that grounds praise.
- **Sign and thing signified** - careful distinction: sacraments are signs that effect what they signify by Spirit, not mere memorials.
- **Ecclesial discipline** - discipline accompanies sacramental life; ensures faithfulness of the covenant community.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for a Reformed doctrine of worship and sacramental efficacy.
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagianism, sacramental superstition, and liberal privatization of worship.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for implementing catechesis, admission, and fencing in congregational life.
