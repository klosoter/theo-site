### TITLE
Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America - James Davison Hunter (1991; widely cited edition 1997)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published at the high point of late-20th-century U.S. polarization (end of Cold War, rise of the Moral Majority, gay-rights and feminist mobilizations). Interdisciplinary milieu: cultural sociology, political science, and religious studies; used extensively by theologians assessing public theology and cultural engagement.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** American public life is structured around enduring cultural conflicts between competing moral visions (labelled **orthodox** and **progressive**) rather than mere partisan or economic divisions. The struggle is about meaning, moral order, and who gets to define the public good.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: The fissures in American society are moral-cultural, rooted in divergent understandings of human nature, authority, and the nature of the good.
 - Typology: Introduces dichotomy of cultural styles - **orthodox** (moral absolutes, transcendent order) vs **progressive** (autonomy, expressive individualism).
 - Mechanisms: Cultural elites, institutions, and symbolic politics shape outcomes; debates are fought in schools, media, courts, churches, and art - arenas where moral authority is asserted.
 - Consequence: Political alignment follows cultural commitments; the "Culture War" language reframes how religious communities understand public engagement and vocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Empirical life-history interviews, polling data, media analysis; interlocutors include leaders of the Religious Right (e.g., Jerry Falwell), feminist and gay-rights activists, cultural elites, scholars of American religion and politics.
- **Doctrines treated (in theological reading):** Not a systematic theology, but engages themes relevant to doctrine:
 - **Vocation** (role of religious agents in public life)
 - **Dominion / culture mandate** (how Christian responsibility toward culture is construed)
 - Authority and revelation implicitly contested through competing claims to moral truth and public order.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Culture Wars reframes public theology: Christians must account for competing moral visions and institutional power in articulating vocation and claims about dominion and the cultural mandate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats cultural conflict as a clash of moral visions rather than mere political disagreement.
 - Emphasizes the institutional and elite-driven nature of cultural change (not just grassroots).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Counters class- or interest-based models of conflict (Marxist/materialist accounts).
 - Complicates facile narratives that locate cultural influence solely in elected politics; argues for attention to symbolic arenas.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized "culture wars" as a sociological heuristic and public idiom.
 - Clear typology (**orthodox vs progressive**) that maps moral intuitions to cultural practice.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely adopted as an analytic frame in evangelical and Reformed discussions about public engagement, the culture mandate, and dominion theology.
 - Used by both critics and advocates of political involvement: conservatives used it to justify cultural mobilization; some theologians used it to critique reductionist political theology.
 - Criticisms from scholars: binary oversimplifies pluralism; underestimates cross-cutting identities; overstates coherence of camps.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a durable diagnostic vocabulary for courses on public theology, Christian ethics, and social witness.
 - Useful case study for vocational reflection: how churches and believers navigate institutional power and moral persuasion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Culture wars:** Contest over public meanings, morals, and the social order; useful shorthand for moral-political conflict.
- **Orthodox:** Moral vision affirming transcendent moral order, traditional norms, limits on autonomy.
- **Progressive:** Moral vision privileging individual autonomy, self-expression, and social change.
- **Cultural elites / creative minorities:** Actors in institutions (academia, media, arts) who shape symbolic capital and norms.
- **Symbolic politics:** Politics organized around moral symbols, identity, and meaning rather than only policy trade-offs.
- **Institutions as arenas:** Schools, courts, churches, media - the loci where cultural authority is contested.
- **Public morality vs private autonomy:** Central tension framing disputes over law, education, and social policy.
- **Moral community:** Imagined solidarities that sustain normative claims and moral orders.
- **Culture as contested terrain:** The analytical posture that culture is not neutral background but active battleground.
- **Vocation (in Hunter's frame):** The role of religious actors in public advocacy and cultural formation.
- **Dominion / culture mandate:** Theological loci invoked by communities in the orthodox camp to justify cultural engagement; Hunter does not offer theology but provides empirical context for how such claims function socially.
- **Institutional power:** How authority is exercised through non-electoral structures.
- **Moral vision coherence:** Degree to which groups articulate sustained normative pictures of society.
- **Public theology implication:** Ways theological claims get translated into public argument and institutional strategy.
- **Polarization dynamics:** Feedback loops between symbolic conflict and political alignment.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the "culture wars" concept and analytic vocabulary in public theology and ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for arguments about Christian vocation and dominion: empirical grounding for strategies of cultural engagement or restraint.
- As a **polemic/resource** to critique both triumphalist dominionism and withdrawalist pietism by showing the institutional mechanics of cultural change.
