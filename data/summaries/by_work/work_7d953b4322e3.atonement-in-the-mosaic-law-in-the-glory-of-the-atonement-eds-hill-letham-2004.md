### TITLE
**"Atonement in the Mosaic Law" - Vern Poythress, in The Glory of the Atonement (eds. Hill & Letham, 2004)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; part of an edited volume surveying biblical and systematic perspectives on the atonement.
 - Poythress writes from a covenantal, Christocentric hermeneutic that seeks continuity between Old Testament cult and New Testament fulfillment.

- **Central thesis**
 - The sacrificial system and Day of Atonement in the Mosaic law both presuppose and illuminate the necessity, scope, and mechanics of atonement ultimately fulfilled in Christ; these cultic rites entail substitution, imputation, and both forensic and relational dimensions rather than merely symbolic or moral-influence functions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Mosaic sacrificial categories (sin offerings, guilt offerings, peace offerings, Day of Atonement) and their theological functions.
 - Demonstration that sacrifices operate within a covenantal legal framework: they remove defilement, restore covenant standing, and mediate forgiveness by means appointed by God.
 - Typological argument: cultic rites point forward to the once-for-all atonement of Christ, preserving continuity in substantive function (substitution, propitiation, expiation) while differing in typological administration (repetition vs. finality).
 - Attention to corporate aspects: Israel's communal identity and corporate solidarity mean atonement in the law addresses both individual and corporate guilt.
 - Concluding synthesis: Mosaic rites are both real means of divine accommodation and anticipatory signs that reveal the necessity and extent of Christ's redemptive work.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Levitical corpus and priestly texts (especially Leviticus 16), typological readings in New Testament (Hebrews), and recent scholarly treatments of sacrificial language.
 - Converses implicitly with reductionist readings (ritual as mere symbol) and with forensic-only accounts that ignore cultic and communal facets.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, atonement (substitution, imputation, expiation, propitiation), priesthood, revelation (typology/fulfillment), Christology (Christ as priest and sacrifice), sacramental/ritual theology, corporate solidarity.

- **Closing line**
 - Mosaic sacrifices are divinely instituted, theologically substantial anticipations that disclose the necessity and breadth of Christ's once-for-all atonement - both forensic and relational, individual and corporate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balances forensic/legal and cultic/relational dimensions of atonement; avoids reducing Levitical rituals to merely symbolic pedagogy.
 - Stresses typology as theological communication rather than mere analogy; the rites both effect provisional divine accommodation and point to definitive fulfillment in Christ.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters moral-influence and purely symbolic interpretations that deny real efficacy to the sacrificial system.
 - Nuances simple "penal substitution" caricatures by integrating priestly mediation, ritual purification, and communal representation into the picture of substitution.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a layered vocabulary: simultaneous use of *expiation* (removal of defilement), *propitiation* (satisfaction of divine wrath), and *imputation* (transfer of guilt/righteousness) as complementary, not exclusive, descriptions of atonement in the law.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for its careful bridging of Old Testament cult and New Testament soteriology.
 - Adopted as an exegetical model in preaching and teaching on how Levitical types inform doctrines of penal substitution and priestly mediation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theologically integrated account useful for systematic treatments of atonement, biblical theology courses, and sermons that seek to show continuity between law and gospel.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement** - The removal/restoration accomplished by sacrificial rites; in Poythress both cultic and anticipatory of Christ.
- **Substitution** - Victim bears guilt/penalty in lieu of the guilty; operative in sin and guilt offerings and fulfilled in Christ.
- **Imputation** - Transfer of guilt to victim and, conversely, of righteousness to the believer; a legal-covenantal mechanism.
- **Expiation** - Cleansing of ritual defilement; emphasizes purification function of sacrifices.
- **Propitiation** - Appeasing of divine holiness/anger; used alongside expiation to describe sacrificial effect.
- **Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur)** - Central cultic locus for corporate cleansing, typologically decisive for understanding final atonement.
- **Sin offering (chatat) / Guilt offering (asham)** - Distinct sacrificial categories addressing impurity and legal culpability; show nuance in Mosaic remedies.
- **Scapegoat (azazel)** - Ritual of removal; exemplifies transfer/banishment of sin in communal atonement.
- **Priestly mediation (cohen)** - Interceding role that prefigures Christ's priesthood; emphasizes representational function.
- **Typology / fulfillment** - Cultic rites as divinely ordained foreshadowings culminating in Christ's once-for-all work.
- **Corporate solidarity** - Israel's communal identity makes atonement both personal and corporate; informs doctrines of federal headship.
- **Forensic vs. cultic language** - Poythress insists both vocabularies are necessary to capture the law's atoning dynamics.
- **Ceremonial law** - Not merely ceremonial in a dismissive sense; carries theological content pointing to Christ.
- **Penal substitution (qualified)** - Affirmed within a broader framework that includes cultic purification and priestly mediation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Exegetical model** for linking Levitical rites to Hebrews and NT atonement language.
 - **Definition source / conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments that integrate forensic and cultic descriptions of atonement.
 - **Polemic resource** against reductionist (moral-influence or purely symbolic) readings of Israelite sacrifice.
