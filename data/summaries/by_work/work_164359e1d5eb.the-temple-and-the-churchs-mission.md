### TITLE
**Gregory K. Beale, The Temple and the Church's Mission: A Biblical Theology of the Dwelling Place of God** (NSBT 17, 2004, Apollos/IVP)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2000s biblical-theological renewal (NSBT series), Reformed and broadly evangelical milieu.
 - Heavily influenced by Klinean covenantal typology and inaugurated eschatology; engages ANE temple cosmology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** From Eden to New Jerusalem, **temple** is the macro-symbol of God dwelling with humanity; the **churchs mission** is to extend this sacred presence worldwide until consummation.
 - **Problem:** How Scripture coherently integrates creation, covenant, cult, kingdom, and mission through the temple motif, and how this shapes eschatology and ecclesiology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Eden as prototypical temple**: Garden on a mountain, with priestly Adam commissioned to expand sacred space (Gen 1:28; 2:15 as priestly-levitical verbs).
 - **OT development**: Tabernacle/Temple as **cosmic microcosm**; priest-king typology; Israel as corporate Adam; exile as de-templing.
 - **Prophetic hope**: Ezek 40-48 and temple-river imagery projecting an eschatological, creation-filling sanctuary.
 - **NT fulfillment in Christ**: Jesus as true temple (John 2), Immanuel presence, crucifixion tearing the veil.
 - **Church as end-time temple**: Spirit-indwelt community as holy place; mission as geographic and ethnic expansion of sacred space (Acts 1:8).
 - **Consummation**: New Jerusalem as temple-city filling creation (Rev 21-22); no separate building because God and the Lamb are its temple.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Primary conversation partners:** Meredith Kline, T. Desmond Alexander, G. Wenham, John Walton, Richard Bauckham, G.B. Caird.
 - **Interlocutors corrected:** Dispensational literal-temple futurism; reductionist sociological mission models; strictly realized eschatologies.
 - **Backgrounds:** ANE temple texts, Second Temple literature, intertextual OT-NT echoes and typology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology:** Already/not-yet temple; Rev 20-22; final judgment and eternal state.
 - **Anthropology / Creation:** **Image of God** as priest-king; **vocation** as dominion and temple-expansion mandate; Adamic federal headship.
 - **Covenant Theology:** Edenic covenant; Israel as corporate Adam; new covenant temple by the Spirit.
 - **Ecclesiology and Missiology:** Church as temple; Great Commission as temple-expansion; holiness and witness.
 - **Bibliology / Hermeneutics:** Canonical intertextuality, typology, symbolic realism.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Gods eschatological presence** is the goal of creation; **Christs temple** and **the churchs mission** advance that presence unto a **cosmic sanctuary**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Cosmic temple** reading of Scripture that unifies creation, cult, and kingdom.
 - **Eden as sanctuary** and Adam as **priest-king**, giving theological depth to the cultural mandate.
 - **Mission as temple-expansion**, not merely proclamation or social action.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters **literalist future-temple** expectations by reading NT temple language ecclesiologically and christologically.
 - Balances realized eschatology with **future consummation**; resists over-realized claims that collapse Rev 21-22 into the present.
 - Nuances law-cult categories with **Klinean intrusion**: holy realm anticipating final judgment within history.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Temple as microcosm** of new creation; **sacred-space expansion** as interpretive key from Genesis to Revelation.
 - Uses **priestly lexeme** analysis (serve/guard) for Adam; reframes **image** as functional, relational, and vocational.
 - Reads OT-NT via **symbolic realism**: images truly refer to realities without demanding wooden literalism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard in evangelical biblical theology; widely used in Reformed seminaries for eschatology and ecclesiology.
 - Shapes missiology with a theologically thick rationale; informs debates on **man of lawlessness** and temple imagery (2 Thess 2).
 - Critiqued at times for typological maximalism; nonetheless broadly respected for exegetical rigor.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a **unifying canon-wide framework**; clarifies the churchs identity and task; strengthens amillennial readings of Revelation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Temple as Cosmic Microcosm**: Architectural-symbolic model of the universe; temple furniture, garden, and mountain imagery map onto creation.
- **Edenic Temple**: Garden as primal sanctuary where God walks; cherubim-guarded east gate prefigures tabernacle.
- **Priest-King Image of God**: Humanity mediates Gods presence and exercises royal dominion; worship and work integrated.
- **Cultural/Dominion Mandate**: Gen 1:28 as call to extend sacred order; reframed in the Great Commission.
- **Intrusion Ethics**: Holy judgment/presence breaking into history (e.g., holy war; cultic holiness), prefiguring the eschaton.
- **Corporate Adam**: Israel recapitulates Adams vocation and failure; Christ as last Adam achieves temple expansion.
- **Shekinah/Glory Presence**: Dwelling of God that animates temple and now the church by the Spirit.
- **Ezekiel 40-48**: Vision of end-time temple and life-giving river; fulfilled in Christs Spirit and Rev 21-22.
- **Measuring the Temple (Rev 11)**: Symbolic preservation of the true worshiping community amid tribulation.
- **Man of Lawlessness / Antichrist**: 2 Thess 2 read with temple-as-church imagery; apostasy within the visible sphere of Gods people.
- **Millennium (Rev 20)**: Inaugurated reign of Christ and saints preceding final judgment; coheres with temple-now/temple-not-yet.
- **Already/Not Yet Eschatology**: Present temple reality in Christ and the Spirit with future consummation in the new creation.
- **Final Judgment and Eternal State**: Purges creation to yield a world that is wholly temple, Rev 21-22.
- **Typology / Symbolic Realism**: Canon-driven correspondences where symbols truly disclose redemptive realities.
- **Mission as Temple-Expansion**: Church plants are outposts of sacred presence, extending worship to the nations.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Exegetical model** for temple texts from Genesis, Ezekiel, John, Paul, and Revelation.
 - **Doctrinal scaffold** for eschatology, ecclesiology, and anthropology (image and vocation).
 - **Polemic resource** against future-literal-temple schemes; for amillennial readings of Rev 20-22.
 - **Conceptual pivot** in missiology: framing the Great Commission as sacred-space expansion.
