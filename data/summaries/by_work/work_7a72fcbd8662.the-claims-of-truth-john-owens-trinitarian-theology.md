### TITLE
The Claims of Truth: John Owen's Trinitarian Theology - Carl R. Trueman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Scholarly study placed in contemporary retrieval of Puritan theology; focuses on 17th-century English Reformed milieu (John Owen, 1616-1683).
 - Political-theological background: English Civil War, Commonwealth, and Oxford/Nonconformist exile debates that shaped Owen's pastoral and polemical writing.
 - Intellectual matrix: Reformed scholasticism, patristic sources, anti-Socinian controversies, and emerging modern philosophical vocabularies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Trueman argues Owen treats Trinitarian doctrine not as abstruse metaphysics but as a decisive, truth-bearing claim that shapes theology, worship, soteriology, and pastoral life. The Trinity for Owen issues normative demands on belief and practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates Owen's consistent integration of the **immanent** and **economic** Trinity: intratrinitarian relations ground the work of redemption.
 - Tracks Owen's method: Scripture-led exegesis mediated by scholastic categories, oriented toward pastoral and polemical ends.
 - Shows how Owen resists reductionist or speculative readings (e.g., Socinian, modalist, or crude subordinationist accounts) while employing metaphysical language (simplicity, relations of origin) to defend orthodox equality and distinction.
 - Concludes by locating Owen as a model for a doctrinal theology that is both metaphysically serious and pastorally engaged.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Owen (works on Christ's exaltation, the Trinity, and assurance).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Socinians/anti-Trinitarians, Arminians, cartesian or early modern philosophers, patristic and scholastic authorities.
 - Contemporary conversation partners: modern Reformed retrievalists and critics of classical trinitarian formulations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent/economic), Christology (hypostatic union, work of Christ), Soteriology (covenant of redemption), Revelation and Scripture, divine attributes (simplicity, immutability), worship, assurance, ecclesiology (doctrine shaping life of church).

- **Closing line**
 - Owen's Trinitarianism is decisive: doctrine of God makes categorical claims upon knowledge, worship, and salvation-truth that governs Christian existence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the Trinity as a normative "claim" - truth that obliges humanity - rather than merely an abstract ontology.
 - Emphasizes intratrinitarian agency: salvific economy proceeds from real relations among persons, not merely functional roles.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that cast Owen as purely speculative scholastic: Trueman emphasizes Owen's pastoral and polemical impulses.
 - Pushes back on modern "social" or relational-only trinitarianisms by showing Owen's commitment to metaphysical unity and divine simplicity alongside personal relations.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Re-framing Owen's theology under the rubric of "claims of truth"-a rhetorical-conceptual lens linking doctrine, epistemology, and moral obligation.
 - Highlights Owen's use of covenantal language (covenant of redemption) as intra-Trinitarian ordering of divine decree.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Spurs renewed scholarly attention to Owen as a coherent Trinitarian theologian rather than an incidental trinitarian commentator.
 - Influences contemporary Reformed theology by providing a model for integrating doctrinal orthodoxy with pastoral application.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a corrective to both speculative and reductionist approaches to the Trinity.
 - Serves as a pedagogical bridge: historical theology that informs modern doctrinal formation and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Claims of Truth**
 - Doctrine as normative demand; truth asserts obligations for belief and life.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - The inner life and relations of the Father, Son, and Spirit as Owen conceives them.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - The external operations of God in redemption traced back to intratrinitarian relations.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of persons; used by Owen within bounds of divine simplicity and distinction.

- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Intra-Trinitarian agreement for redemption; central to Owen's linkage of Christology and Trinity.

- **Divine Simplicity**
 - God's non-composite being; Owen balances simplicity with real personal distinctions.

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Union of divine and human natures in Christ; Owen ties this to Trinitarian identity and work.

- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - Language of attributing properties across Christ's natures; Owen applies trinitarian logic to Christological speech.

- **Revelation / Scripture**
 - Scripture as the rule and norm that articulates and enforces the Trinity's claims.

- **Soteriology (Trinitarian shape)**
 - Salvation as ordered by the persons and relations of the Trinity.

- **Anti-Socinian Polemic**
 - Owen's argumentation against denial of Personhood or divinity of the Son and Spirit.

- **Ontological Equality vs. Relational Distinction**
 - Owen's insistence on equal deity of persons while affirming relational origins (begetting, spirating).

- **Trinitarian Worship**
 - Worship practices and assurance formed by correct doctrine of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for Owen's trinitarian commitments and the covenantal ordering of redemption.
- As a polemical resource in debates with revisionist/social trinitarian readings and anti-Trinitarian critiques.
- As an exegetical-model for reading Puritan theology where doctrine, pastoral care, and polemic are tightly integrated.
- As a conceptual pivot in courses on historical theology, demonstrating how metaphysical doctrine shapes worship and pastoral life.
