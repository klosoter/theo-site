### TITLE
De Magistro (On the Teacher) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 4th century (c. 390). Short pedagogical dialogue written soon after Augustine's conversion and baptism; situated in the Christianizing intellectual milieu that blends Biblical theology with Neoplatonic epistemology and Roman rhetorical culture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** True teaching does not consist primarily in verbal transmission of facts; words are signs that point to realities, but knowledge of those realities comes from an interior Teacher (magister interior) - ultimately God. The work pursues the question: what is the nature of teaching and how do humans come to know truth, especially knowledge of God?
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Dialogue form between Augustine (narrator) and his son Adeodatus.
 - Opening question: can a teacher by words give knowledge to a learner?
 - Analysis of signs: words and external signs signify things but are not the thing signified.
 - Investigation of where knowledge resides: memory, understanding, will - and the necessity of an inner illumination.
 - Resolution: teachers may instruct by pointing, but the interior Teacher (God) is the source of understanding; true knowledge is participatory and illuminated.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutor: Adeodatus (Augustine's son).
 - Implicit engagement with Roman rhetorical pedagogy (Cicero-style teaching), Stoic/Platonic theories of signs, and Neoplatonic illumination (Plotinian influence).
 - Biblical underpinning: concepts of divine teaching/illumination, though scriptural texts are not exhaustively exegeted.
- **Doctrines treated:** Epistemology (knowledge, memory, understanding), revelation and divine illumination, pedagogy and authority, indirectly theology of God as Teacher (with implications for grace), ethics of teaching.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Words are necessary signs but insufficient; real knowing is an interior, divinely enabled apprehension - the human teacher points, God the inner Teacher enables the seeing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The **magister interior** (inner Teacher) as the primary epistemic agent: Augustine reframes teaching as an invitation to interior illumination rather than mere verbal instruction.
 - Forceful separation of **sign** and **thing signified** - a subtle semantic-epistemic analysis predating medieval semiotics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushback against purely rhetorical pedagogy that confuses eloquence with knowledge; critique of the idea that verbal eloquence transmits truth by itself.
 - Modifies Platonic reminiscence by locating recollection/resulting knowledge in a dependence upon divine illumination rather than solely on an immortal soul's memory.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of the teacher-as-significant metaphor and the explicit naming of an inner Teacher as the locus of understanding.
 - Distinction among memory (memoria), understanding/intellect (intellectus), and will (voluntas) in epistemic process.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely read by medieval scholastics as a key text on interior knowledge and the relationship of signs to things.
 - Reformation and post-Reformation figures engaged Augustine's illumination theme ambivalently: used to support the necessity of grace for knowledge of God, but contested where it suggested an extra-Scriptural inner light independent of Scripture (Calvin critiqued certain notions of an autonomous inner light).
 - Influenced pastoral theology, theories of instruction, and later epistemological debates about the role of experience and testimony.
- **Enduring value:** Concise, disciplined model of Christian epistemology linking pedagogy, signs, and divine grace; indispensable for courses on theological method, sacramental/sign theory, and Augustine's epistemology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Magister interior (inner Teacher):** God (or divine illumination) as the immediate source of true understanding; the core Augustinian move.
- **Signum / sign (sign):** External or verbal indicator that points to a reality but is not identical with it.
- **Verbum / verba (word/words):** Linguistic signs used by human teachers that signify things yet do not contain knowledge.
- **Res (thing signified):** The reality to which a sign or word refers; knowledge ultimately concerns apprehending the res.
- **Memoria (memory):** Repository of impressions; plays a role in recollection but must be awakened by understanding.
- **Intellectus (understanding/intellect):** The faculty that apprehends truth when illuminated; requires inner teaching.
- **Voluntas (will):** The affective/motivational faculty implicated in assent and readiness to receive knowledge.
- **Illuminatio (illumination):** Divine enabling of the intellect to apprehend truth; central epistemic mechanism.
- **Teaching (docere) vs. showing (monstrare):** Distinction that teachers point and show; they do not deposit knowledge like goods in a receptacle.
- **Authority of teacher:** Social and pedagogical function; secondary and dependent on the inner Teacher.
- **Epistemic humility:** Pedagogy anchored in humility about limits of words and the need for divine aid.
- **Semiotic distinction:** Early treatment of sign-signified relation that anticipates later medieval scholasticism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Augustine's theory of divine illumination and the inner Teacher in epistemology.
 - As a **polemic** against rhetorical nominalism about teaching and against any view that equates eloquence with knowledge.
 - As a **model** for catechesis and pastoral pedagogy emphasizing pointing to truths rather than mere verbal instruction.
