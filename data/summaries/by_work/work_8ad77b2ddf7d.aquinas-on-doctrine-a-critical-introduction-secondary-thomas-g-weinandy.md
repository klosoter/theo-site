### TITLE
Aquinas on Doctrine: A Critical Introduction (primary: Thomas Aquinas; secondary: Thomas G. Weinandy) - focused reading on **Sacraments as Means of Grace**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century Scholasticism; Dominican intellectual formation (Aquinas, Summa Theologiae, Summa Contra Gentiles).
 - Post-4th Lateran Council sacramental consolidation; engagement with Augustine, Gratian, and Aristotelian causality.
 - Weinandy (modern secondary literature) frames Aquinas for contemporary doctrinal retrieval and ecumenical conversation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How do the sacraments, as visible rites, actually effect sanctifying grace? Are they mere signs, or real instrumental causes of divine action, and what are the respective roles of Christ, minister, and recipient?

- **Core argument / structure (Aquinas as exposited by Weinandy)**
 - Sacraments are instituted by Christ and thus have objective efficacy: they are simultaneously **signs (signa)** and **causes (causae)** of grace.
 - Uses Aristotelian causal schema to argue sacraments operate as **instrumental causes** (Christ = principal efficient cause; sacramental matter = instrument).
 - Technical anatomy:
 - **Matter and form** - visible element(s) + verbal form effect the sacramental sign.
 - **Ministerial role** - minister acts instrumentally; validity requires proper intention and correct form/matter.
 - **Recipient disposition** - sacraments confer grace "ex opere operato" (by the work performed) but fruitfulness depends on faith/charity (contrast: ex opere operantis).
 - Differentiates types of sacramental effect: giving sanctifying grace, remitting guilt, conveying sacramental character, effecting actual grace.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Augustine (tradition of sacramental realism), Gratian and canonical tradition, Aristotle (causality), later medievals (Albert, Bonaventure), and later reception at Trent.
 - Weinandy dialogues with modern interpreters - retrieving Aquinas for contemporary doctrinal clarity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology (center), with interwoven treatment of Christology (Christ as principal cause), grace, ecclesiology, sacramental economy, and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - For Aquinas (as Weinandy reads him), sacraments are Christ-mediated, created-material instruments that objectively convey sanctifying grace while requiring the human disposition to receive their fruit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Clear integration of **Aristotelian instrumentality** into sacramental causality: sacraments are real, created instruments of divine action, not mere symbols.
 - Precise technical distinctions: **ex opere operato** vs **ex opere operantis**, and rigorous account of ministerial intention and sacramental signs.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Stronger ontological efficacy than purely symbolic or memorialist accounts (e.g., Zwinglian).
 - More objective sacramental causality than some Protestant readings which locate efficacy primarily in faith or Word/Spirit alone.
 - Nuanced correction of simplifications in later medieval devotion by focusing on metaphysical causality and normative conditions for efficacy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of **signum et causa** language in a Thomistic metaphysical frame.
 - Emphasis on multiple causal levels (principal cause = Christ; instrumental cause = matter; formal cause = form/word).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Catholic doctrine consolidation at Trent and subsequent Catholic sacramental theology.
 - Provokes critique and dialogue in Reformed circles: Calvin affirms spiritual efficacy mediated by Word and Spirit but rejects instrumental material causality; Luther preserves objective presence but differs on metaphysical grounds.
 - Modern ecumenical dialogues frequently return to Thomistic categories to clarify differences.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical clarity for teaching sacramental theology; methodological model for integrating metaphysics, liturgy, and pastoral criteria.
 - A stable doctrinal pivot for Catholic-Protestant conversation on objective vs subjective sacramental efficacy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramentum (sacrament)** - instituted sign by Christ that confers grace; both visible and efficacious.
- **Signum et causa (sign and cause)** - core Thomistic formula: sacrament is a sign and at the same time a cause of grace.
- **Matter and form** - the physical element(s) and the verbal/formulaic component that together constitute the sacrament's sign and instrumental structure.
- **Instrumental cause** - created element functions as the instrument by which Christ (principal efficient cause) effects grace.
- **Ex opere operato** - efficacy attributed to the sacrament's proper celebration, not to minister's personal holiness; qualified by recipient disposition.
- **Ex opere operantis** - efficacy shaped by the work/faith of the recipient; explains moral/subjective fruitfulness.
- **Ministerial intention** - minister must intend to do what the Church does; necessary for validity but not absolute meritoriousness.
- **Sanctifying grace** - habitual gift conferred by sacraments that heals and sanctifies the soul.
- **Sacramental character / indelible mark** - ontological change (Baptism, Confirmation, Orders) that configures the soul.
- **Principal efficient cause (Christ)** - Christ as the ultimate agent whose power operates through sacraments.
- **Instrumentality of matter** - created elements (water, bread, oil) are genuine instruments of divine action, not merely symbolic props.
- **Validity vs licitness** - theological distinction preserved: a rite can be valid yet illicit; validity hinges on form, matter, and intention.
- **Actual grace** - temporal helps conferred by sacraments to perform moral acts; distinct from sanctifying grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Catholic sacramental doctrine (clarifying causal language).
 - As a **polemic and comparative pivot** in debates with Protestant sacramental theologies (e.g., on instrumental causality and ex opere operato).
 - As an **exegetical-model and conceptual toolkit** for integrating liturgical practice, metaphysics, and pastoral criteria in sacramental theology.
