### TITLE
**J. Richard Middleton, The Liberating Image: The Imago Dei in Genesis 1**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2000s evangelical/academic biblical-theological conversation over the imago Dei; response to longstanding debates between substantive, relational, and functional models. Middleton writes as an evangelical Old Testament scholar with interest in canonical, ANE, and theological-historical interaction.
- **Central thesis**
 - The imago Dei in Genesis 1 is primarily a **functional-covenantal status and vocation**-God's delegate(s) who rule and steward creation-rather than a merely ontological "property" (e.g., rationality, immortality). This reading is "liberating" because it frees the image from philosophical reductions and misuses for domination.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of Genesis 1 language (form, function, royal imagery).
 - Comparative look at Ancient Near Eastern notions of "divine image" (statues, kingship) to show functional analogues.
 - Canonical linkage: Genesis 1 → Genesis 2, prophetic texts, Psalms, and New Testament (Christ as true image) to demonstrate continuity and fulfillment.
 - Theological implications for anthropology, ethics, church, and culture: image-bearing is corporate (male and female together), vocational (rule/stewardship), and restored in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical scholars across windows: proponents of substantive accounts, relational models, and those influenced by ANE studies. Interacts implicitly/explicitly with classic sources (Augustine, Calvin) and modern interpreters (recent evangelical and secular ANE specialists).
 - Uses Old Testament, ANE texts, and New Testament Christological passages (e.g., Colossians, 2 Corinthians).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and human nature (anthropology), covenant, Christology (Christ as perfect image), ecclesiology (corporate image-bearing), ethics (stewardship, justice), and indirect implications for Trinitarian reflection (the "let us" and relationality).
- **Closing line**
 - The human image is best understood theologically as **a bestowed, corporate, vocational status-God's representatives charged to rule, steward, and cultivate creation-and ultimately restored in Christ**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly prioritizes **functional/vocational status** over substantive property lists; treats the imago primarily as role and status within God's created order.
 - Emphasizes **corporate and gendered completion**: male and female together instantiate the image; this resists individualistic renderings.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that reduce imago Dei to capacities (reason, morality) or to intrinsic worth detached from vocation.
 - Offers corrective to both secular anthropocentrism (unchecked domination) and pietistic denigration of embodied cultural engagement.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames the imago as a **liberating category**: liberation from idolatries (imperial/tribal images), and liberation toward just, creative cultural rule.
 - Recasts dominion language as stewardship tied to covenantal responsibility, not exploitative mastery.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and Reformed contexts as a major modern defense of the functional/covenantal model.
 - Has informed work in Christian ethics, political theology, ecological theology, and debates on human dignity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a tightly argued exegetical-theological paradigm that links Genesis 1 to Christology and ecclesiology; useful for teaching biblical anthropology and for shaping socially accountable ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei**
 - The divine image in humanity understood as a bestowed office-status and vocation to represent God.
- **Functional model**
 - Image = role (vice-regent, ruler, steward) rather than a set of innate properties.
- **Substantive view**
 - The rival account that locates the image in human capacities (reason, morality, soul); Middleton critiques its reductionism.
- **Relational view**
 - Emphasizes human relationship to God/other humans; Middleton integrates relationality within the broader functional-covenantal frame.
- **Vice-regency / royal representative**
 - Core metaphor: humans as God's deputies exercising rule on God's behalf.
- **Dominion / stewardship**
 - Interprets dominion as responsible stewardship and cultivation (not exploitative domination).
- **Corporate image-bearing**
 - The idea that **male + female together** constitute the full instantiation of the image; resists atomized individualism.
- **Covenantal status**
 - Image as a legal/relational standing conferred by God within the created covenant order.
- **Canon and typology**
 - Use of Christ as the true/fulfilling image (New Testament fulfillment; restoration motif).
- **ANE parallels**
 - Comparative data showing image-language often denotes statues/representatives and royal status rather than abstract properties.
- **Liberation motif**
 - Theological framing: image frees humans from idols and empowers ethical cultural formation.
- **Anthropology**
 - Emphasizes vocation and communal identity over isolated ontological traits.
- **Creation mandate / cultural mandate**
 - The practical outworking of image-bearing in culture-making, institutions, and care for creation.
- **Human dignity**
 - Grounded in bestowed covenantal status and vocation, sustained by Christ's restoration.

- **Typical uses across loci**
 - As a definitional source for evangelical anthropologies emphasizing vocation and corporate identity.
 - As an exegetical model and polemic against substantive reductions and exploitative readings; used as a conceptual pivot for ethics, ecology, and political theology.
