### TITLE
The Theology of Crisis - Emil Brunner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the era between the World Wars and developed amid the theological upheavals of the 1920s-1940s (reaction to liberal optimism, secularization, rise of political totalitarianisms). Brunner stands in the neo-orthodox/Swiss Reformed milieu alongside Karl Barth but with important disagreements.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Theology must answer the modern "crisis" of meaning, sin, and secular rationalism by recovering revelation as a personal, historical encounter in Christ; Christology and the proclamation of the kingdom are the decisive response to existential and cultural collapse.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: modernity produces a crisis of reason, ethics, and soteriology - human resources cannot bridge rupture with God.
 - Epistemology of theology: revelation is an event of divine self-disclosure to persons, not merely propositional data or natural-theological extrapolation.
 - Christological pivot: Jesus Christ is the mediating revelation who manifests God's messianic claim and inaugurates the kingdom; the historical Jesus and his self-consciousness are the locus of revelation.
 - Ecclesial and eschatological application: the church proclaims and participates in the kingdom that is already present but awaiting consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogue with liberal theology (ethical/progressive strands), direct and sustained engagement with Karl Barth (disagreement over natural theology and the role of reason), appropriation of patristic and Reformation tropes (mediator, Word), and interaction with contemporary existential concerns (Kierkegaardian personalism influence).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (event/encounter), Christology (mediator, messianic consciousness), Kingdom of God (already/not-yet), anthropology (sin and guilt), soteriology (reconciliation through Christ), ecclesiology (church as witness and community), incidental treatment of natural theology and ethics.
- **Closing line:** Brunner centers theology on the historical, personal revelation of God in Christ as the only adequate response to modern crisis - a Christocentric theology that affirms both the reality of human knowledge and the priority of revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Revelation as **relational encounter**: theology must describe a meeting between God and persons rather than a merely propositional system.
 - Strong stress on the **historicity of Jesus' messianic consciousness**-Jesus as consciously inaugurating the kingdom rather than being an idea imposed retroactively.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Against liberalism: rejects optimism that religion is reducible to ethics or culture; insists on disruptive divine action.
 - Against Barthian absolutism: maintains a qualified role for natural knowledge and human reason; resists the complete severing of creation and revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting "crisis" as theological locus - not only social/political but epistemic and spiritual.
 - Emphasis on the term **mediator** as the decisive ontological bridge in theology of crisis.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in mid-20th century Reformed and ecumenical circles as a pastoral, pastoral-critical corrective to both liberal optimism and Barthian austerity.
 - Criticized by strict Barthians for openness to natural theology; appreciated by theologians seeking a middle way between liberal and dialectical approaches.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating Christology, revelation, and social diagnosis.
 - Useful for courses on neo-orthodoxy, modern Christology, and theology of modernity; offers a robust model for preaching and pastoral theology in times of social breakdown.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Crisis:** The theological category diagnosing modernity's rupture of trust, meaning, and moral efficacy; the starting point for theology.
- **Revelation as encounter:** Revelation is a personal, historical event in which God addresses human beings through Christ.
- **Mediator:** Christ as the ontological and soteriological bridge between God and humanity; central rung in Brunner's system.
- **Messianic consciousness (Christ's):** Brunner affirms Jesus' own self-understanding as Messiah-active, historical, and constitutive of kingdom claims.
- **Kingdom of God:** Inaugurated and present in Christ; an eschatological reality that is already operative but not yet consummated.
 - Relation to Christ: kingdom is both declared by and embodied in Jesus' ministry.
- **Already / Not-yet:** Tension between present realization of God's reign and future consummation; Brunner uses this to preserve historical significance without dissolving eschatology.
- **Natural theology:** Granted a qualified role (contrast with Barth) - human reason and created order can witness to God but cannot replace revelation.
- **Personalism:** Anthropology emphasizing persons and relationships; theological method aims to describe divine-human encounter.
- **Historicity:** Emphasis that biblical and Christological claims are rooted in real history, not merely existential symbols.
- **Sin and guilt:** The existential condition that precipitates crisis and necessitates Christ's reconciling action.
- **Church as witness:** The ecclesial community proclaims the kingdom and embodies the reconciling presence of Christ.
- **Law and Gospel:** Retained as interpretive categories for ethics and proclamation; law diagnoses, gospel heals.
- **The Word (Logos/Verbum):** The communicative act of God realized supremely in Christ.
- **Eschatology:** Not merely future expectation but present dynamism shaped by Christ's messianic work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "revelation as encounter" and for reading Christ's messianic self-awareness historically.
 - As a **polemic** in debates with Barth and liberals over natural theology and the role of history.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Christology and kingdom studies - grounding proclamation in Jesus' own consciousness and actions.
