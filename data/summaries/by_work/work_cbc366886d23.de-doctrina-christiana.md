### TITLE
De Doctrina Christiana (On Christian Doctrine) - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed c. 397-426 CE in North Africa amid controversies over preaching, post-Donatist and Pelagian tensions and Augustine's pastoral responsibilities.
 - Situated at the intersection of late antique Christian theology, classical rhetoric, and pastoral formation; responds to a Christian need for disciplined Biblical interpretation and effective proclamation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How should a Christian read, interpret, teach, and preach Scripture so that it truly forms the mind and will toward God? Augustine proposes principles and techniques that make Scripture the primary instrument for eliciting right love.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Book I-II: Praesuppositions and aims - Scripture is divinely inspired and its interpretation must aim at the love of God and neighbor; secular learning is usable but subordinate.
 - Book III: Rules of interpretation - distinction of signs (signa) vs. things (res), literal vs. spiritual senses, and the role of clear texts in resolving obscure ones.
 - Book IV: Rhetorical instruction - teaching clergy and laity how to communicate Scripture effectively (docere, delectare, movere).
 - Overarching move: combine philological attention to words, philosophical concepts of signs, and Christian charity as the hermeneutical rule.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy engagement with Scripture; draws on Cicero (rhetoric), classical grammatical and rhetorical pedagogy, Stoic ideas of signs; dialogues with contemporary ecclesial practice and earlier exegetical traditions (e.g., Origen's allegory, Ambrose's preaching).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and bibliology (Scripture as authoritative sign), hermeneutics (literal and spiritual senses), theology of love (caritas as rule), ecclesiology (preaching, instruction), sacraments treated as signs pointing beyond themselves; indirectly informs covenantal and soteriological concerns via interpretive method.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine centers Christian doctrine on Scripture as a divinely instituted set of signs whose correct interpretation-governed by love of God and neighbor and disciplined rhetoric-teaches, delights, and moves the church toward holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Love (caritas) as hermeneutical norm**
 - Interpretation is not primarily an intellectual puzzle but a moral act: the true meaning of Scripture is that which fosters ordered love of God above all and neighbor as self.
- **Signs and referents (signa / res)**
 - Augustine develops a semiotic strategy: words and sacraments are signs that point to realities; misreading confuses sign with thing.
- **Balanced use of classical learning**
 - Affirms rhetorical and grammatical tools for Christian teaching while strongly subordinating pagan wisdom to Christian ends; famous maxim: use secular arts as "servants" of faith.
- **Corrective to excessive allegory and literalism**
 - Rejects unbounded allegory (a la some Origenist abuses) and rigid literalism: literal sense is primary but must be read in light of charity and the rule of faith.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Medieval, patristic, and scholastic exegesis absorb Augustine's rules; major influence on homiletics. Reformation theologians (notably Calvin) appropriate Augustine's stress on Scripture's authority and the centrality of love, while differing on some doctrinal outcomes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, theological hermeneutic that integrates philology, philosophy of signs, pastoral rhetoric, and ethical rule; indispensable for studies in bibliology, preaching, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Signum / signa (signs)** - words, rituals, and symbols that point beyond themselves to divine realities.
- **Res (thing / reality)** - the referent to which signs point; theological interpretation seeks the res, not merely the verba.
- **Verba (words)** - linguistic vehicles; must be handled with grammatical precision but subordinated to meaning.
- **Caritas (charity / love)** - the controlling norm for interpretation: ordered love of God and neighbor.
- **Intentio (intention)** - authorial and interpreter's aim; discerning intent is essential for correct exegesis.
- **Sensus literalis / sensus spiritualis** - literal sense as foundation; spiritual (allegorical/moral/anagogical) senses allowed when consistent with charity and the rule of faith.
- **Regula fidei (rule of faith)** - authoritative theological framework to adjudicate ambiguous readings.
- **Docere, delectare, movere** - rhetorical ends of Christian discourse: to teach, to delight, to move (persuade toward virtue).
- **Use of secular learning** - permissible as an instrument (instrumentum), not as a competing norm.
- **Clara non sunt utere** (principle) - prefer clear passages to interpret obscure ones; unity of Scripture governs interpretation.
- **Sacraments as signs** - rites both visible and symbolic, instructing and confirming the faithful.
- **Order of loves (ordo amoris)** - ethical hierarchy used to evaluate interpretations and practice.
- **Preaching / homiletics** - practical application of Augustine's rhetorical method for pastoral instruction.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for bibliology and hermeneutical principles (authority, inspiration, senses).
 - As a **polemic tool** against misuses of allegory, literalism, or secular learning divorced from faith.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating philology, semiotics, and theology in sermon-making and doctrinal teaching.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of sacramental signs and the pastoral aims of doctrine.
