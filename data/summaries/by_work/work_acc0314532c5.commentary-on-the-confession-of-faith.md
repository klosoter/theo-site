### TITLE
Commentary on the Confession of Faith - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Presbyterianism; Princeton School of systematic and biblical theology. Hodge published his line-by-line exposition of the Westminster Confession to instruct pastors and laity in confessional Reformed belief amid challenges from revivalism, Unitarianism, Romanism, and rising modernist currents.
 - Site usage: addresses two topical areas explicitly consulted here - **Church and State Relations** and **Filioque and Ecumenical Creeds**.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend and elucidate the Westminster Confession as a faithful, biblical summary of Reformed orthodoxy: Scripture is the ultimate rule; the Confession explicates Scripture for doctrine, worship, and polity against heterodox alternatives.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clause-by-clause exposition of the Confession, combining:
 - Historical-grammatical reading of confession texts.
 - Canonical and biblical proof-texting for each article.
 - Systematic synthesis linking articles into broader loci (God, Christ, salvation, church, sacraments, last things).
 - Frequent polemical appendices or remarks addressing Roman Catholic claims, Arminianism, Socinianism/Unitarianism, and novel American theological trends.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Westminster divines, Calvin, Augustine (Trinitarian tradition).
 - Critics treated: Roman Catholic magisterial claims, Arminians, Unitarians, German speculative theology.
 - Hodge relies on Scripture, councilal formulations (Nicene/Creed), and Reformed scholastic sources for doctrinal buttress.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture; doctrine of God and Trinity; Christology; covenant theology (works/ grace); predestination; justification by faith; sanctification; church polity and sacraments; civil government and the magistrate; eschatology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Hodge's Commentary seeks to anchor Reformed piety and practice in a confessed, scriptural orthodoxy that preserves divine sovereignty, covenant structure, and the church's distinct spiritual jurisdiction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous confessionalism: Hodge treats the Confession not as optional commentary but as a necessary, subordinate standard to Scripture.
 - Method: sober biblical exegesis allied to systematic coherence rather than speculative metaphysics or romantic experientialism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Against Roman Catholicism: rebuttal of magisterial and sacramental claims, insistence on sola Scriptura and justification by faith.
 - Against liberal/modernist trends: insistence on inerrancy (as understood by Hodge) and historical grounding of doctrine.
 - On church/state: balances magistrate authority for civil order with a strict denial that the state may rule spiritual conscience - rejects both theocratic domination and full Erastian absorption of church life.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Not novel in neologisms, but durable synthesis: Hodge systematizes Reformed confessional language for American ecclesiastical application, clarifying terms like "commonwealth" and "jurisdiction" in polity matters.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a staple for Presbyterian ministers and seminaries; influential in conservative Reformed circles, especially Princeton and subsequent conservative Presbyterianism.
 - Criticized by liberals for epistemological conservatism and by some later evangelicals for pietistic deficits; nonetheless a primary confessional reference.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable primer on how to read and defend the Westminster Confession scripturally; a model for confessional exegesis and for integrating doctrinal loci with pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith**
 - Hodge treats it as faithful, subordinate standard explicating biblical doctrine and polity.
- **Scripture as Rule of Faith**
 - Ultimate authority; confessions are subordinate explications.
- **Covenant Theology**
 - Central hermeneutic: covenant of works and covenant of grace structure redemptive history and ecclesiology.
- **Sovereignty of God**
 - Foundation for predestination, providence, and the application of redemption.
- **Predestination / Election**
 - Defended as biblical and pastoral truth; linked to assurance and mission.
- **Church and State (civil magistrate)**
 - Magistrate ordained to promote public good and punish evil, but may not usurp church's spiritual jurisdiction; a careful balance rejecting both theocracy and state-controlled church.
- **Regulative Principle of Worship**
 - Worship limited to what Scripture prescribes; Hodge articulates pastoral implications for order and sacraments.
- **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed / Ecumenical Creeds**
 - Treated as historically normative summaries of Trinitarian faith; useful and authoritative but subordinate to Scripture.
- **Filioque**
 - Discussed within Trinitarian treatment: Hodge defends orthodox Western formulations as theologically defensible while emphasizing scriptural grounding and warning against needless alterations of ecumenical texts.
- **Justification by Faith**
 - Central soteriological article; polemical against Roman sacramentalism and works-righteousness.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper)**
 - Signs and seals of the covenant; not meritorious but means of grace within covenant community.
- **Erastianism**
 - Rejected where it would place ecclesiastical governance under civil jurisdiction.
- **Inerrancy / Biblical Authority**
 - Assumed; Hodge appeals to Scripture as reliable and sufficient for doctrine.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed confessional doctrine and vocabulary.
 - As a **polemic** resource against Romanism, Arminianism, and modernism.
 - As an **exegetical-model** showing how to ground confession articles in Scripture for pastoral teaching and church polity.
