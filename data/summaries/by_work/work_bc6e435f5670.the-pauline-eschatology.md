### TITLE
The Pauline Eschatology - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Old Princeton Reformed theology; published 1930 amid German critical debates on Paul (Weiss, Schweitzer) and liberal de-eschatologizing tendencies.
 - A flagship in Vosian biblical theology, integrating exegetical rigor with dogmatics against moralistic or purely historical-critical readings.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Eschatology is architectonic for Paul**: the work of Christ and the gift of the Spirit inaugurate the age to come, creating an **overlap of the ages** that structures all Pauline doctrines.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Two-age schema**: this age vs. the age to come; Christ's resurrection is the hinge of redemptive history.
 - **Union with Christ** as the medium of participation in eschatological life; forensic and transformative benefits flow from the risen Christ.
 - **Spirit as arrabon/firstfruits**: the Spirit realizes proleptic eschatology in believers and the church.
 - **Soteriology in eschatological frame**:
 - Justification tethered to resurrection (Rom 4:25) and the new order.
 - Sanctification as **semi-eschatological** life in the Spirit over against the flesh.
 - Adoption, assurance, and hope oriented to final glorification.
 - **Anthropology and resurrection**: soma, sarx, and pneumatic body; continuity/discontinuity in the resurrection.
 - **Law and sin**: the law's aeonic function; power of sin broken in Christ; life under the new aeon.
 - **Parousia and consummation**: resurrection of the dead, judgment, cosmic renewal; 2 Thess 2's man of lawlessness within the interadvental tension.
 - **Ecclesial life**: sacraments as participation in the death-resurrection economy; church as eschatological community.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages German eschatological school (J. Weiss, A. Schweitzer), liberal Protestant moralism, mystical-psychological readings of Paul; stands within Reformed orthodoxy (Calvinic-federal categories) and interacts with classical exegesis of Romans, Corinthians, Thessalonians, Ephesians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical-theological method; covenant and federal headship; Christology (Last Adam); Pneumatology; Soteriology (ordo in light of historia salutis); Anthropology and Sin; Ecclesiology and Sacraments; Eschatology proper (intermediate state, parousia, resurrection, new creation).
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Christ's resurrection, by the Spirit, inaugurates the new creation so that all Pauline doctrine is life between the ages in union with the Last Adam.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Formalization of **inaugurated eschatology** before its broad popularization; the **overlap of the ages** as hermeneutical master-key.
 - Tight linkage of **justification and resurrection**; forensic benefit grounded in historia salutis, not merely in ordo categories.
 - **Union with Christ** as covenantal-solidaric, not merely mystical or ethical.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Schweitzer's thoroughgoing eschatology that collapses the present into the imminent end; against liberal ethical reductions that evacuate the apocalyptic horizon.
 - Balances Dodd-like realized emphases by insisting on the **not yet** and future bodily resurrection.
 - Reorients Reformed dogmatics that isolate ordo salutis by embedding it in **redemptive history**.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **Two ages**, **already/not yet**, **arrabon** and **firstfruits**, **pneumatic body**, **semi-eschatological sanctification**, **Last Adam** as **federal-eschatological head**, **prolepsis** of new creation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Reformed biblical theology; shaping Ridderbos, Gaffin, Kline, Murray, and Westminster tradition; widely used by evangelical Pauline scholars.
 - Serves as a bridge between exegesis and systematics in seminary curricula; enduring point of reference on Romans 5-8, 1 Cor 15, 2 Thess 2.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides an integrative framework spanning Soteriology, Eschatology, Christology, and Pneumatology with exegetical ballast; a durable antidote to reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Two Ages**: This age vs. the age to come; basic Pauline horizon shaping ethics, worship, and hope.
- **Already/Not Yet**: Inauguration in Christ with consummation pending; explains tension in assurance, sanctification, and suffering.
- **Union with Christ**: Covenantal solidarity by Spirit-wrought participation in Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Last Adam / Federal Headship**: Christ as eschatological counterpart to Adam; grounds imputation and new-creation life.
- **Resurrection-Principle**: Christ's resurrection as causal source and pattern of justification and renewal.
- **Justification and Resurrection**: Forensic verdict tied to resurrection vindication; Rom 4:25 as programmatic.
- **Eschatological Spirit**: Spirit as agent of the age to come; power of new life, seal, and pledge.
 - **Arrabon / Firstfruits**: Down payment guaranteeing future inheritance; present possession and future certainty.
- **Pneumatic Body**: Resurrection body transformed by the Spirit; real continuity yet eschatological transformation.
- **Ordo vs. Historia Salutis**: Application of redemption is interpreted through once-for-all redemptive events.
- **Law and Aeons**: Law's temporary, age-conditioned role; fulfilled and transcended in Christ.
- **Intermediate State**: Real communion with Christ before resurrection, without eclipsing the bodily hope.
- **Parousia**: Visible return, final judgment, and renewal; shapes present perseverance and mission.
- **New Creation**: Cosmic scope of redemption; ecclesial and ethical implications now.
- **Powers and Principalities**: Christ's victory over hostile powers as eschatological liberation.

- **How this work is used across loci**

 - As a **conceptual pivot** integrating Soteriology, Christology, and Pneumatology around resurrection and Spirit.
 - As a **polemic resource** against moralism, de-eschatologizing liberalism, and purely psychological mysticism.
