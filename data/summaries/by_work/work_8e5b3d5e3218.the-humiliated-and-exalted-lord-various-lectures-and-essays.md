### TITLE
The Humiliated and Exalted Lord (lectures and essays) - Donald Macleod 
Site usage: 1 reference (topic: Eternal Sonship and Incarnation)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed academic milieu; Macleod writes as a conservative Scottish systematic theologian engaging patristic, Reformation, and contemporary scholarship.
 - Oriented to confessional Reformed commitments while dialoguing with modern theology (Barthian themes, kenotic proposals, and historical-critical readings of Philippians 2, John, Hebrews).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the classical doctrine of the **eternal Sonship** and a robust Chalcedonian **incarnation** against modern reductions (adoptionism, radical kenoticism, and collapse of intratrinitarian relations into economy).
 - To show how the Son's eternal relation to the Father grounds the reality of the incarnate Son's humiliation and exaltation without impairment of divine being.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical texts (esp. John, Philippians 2, Hebrews) that speak to Sonship, humiliation (kenosis), and exaltation.
 - Retrieval and defense of classical categories: **eternal generation**, hypostatic union (two natures, one person), communicatio idiomatum.
 - Critique of alternative models:
 - Adoptionist tendencies that locate Sonship only at incarnation.
 - Kenotic theories that posit loss/removal of divine attributes.
 - Barthian re-interpretations that subordinate eternal relations to economic revelation.
 - Positive synthesis:
 - The Son is eternally begotten - a real intratrinitarian relation that is not a temporal becoming.
 - In the incarnation the eternal Son assumes human nature and voluntarily enters a state of humiliation (self-limitation), yet his divine attributes remain real though exercised in accordance with the kenotic mode.
 - Exaltation vindicates and glorifies the incarnate Son and consummates the economy without reversing eternal relations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic (Athanasius, Augustine), Chalcedonian formula, Reformation (Calvin), moderns (Barth, Torrance), and proponents of kenoticism.
 - Engagement with recent exegesis of Philippians 2 and Johannine christology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (eternal generation, intratrinitarian relations), Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union, kenosis, exaltation), soteriology as grounded in the person of the Son, revelation and the economy of salvation.
- **Closing line**
 - The work stresses that only by affirming the Son's **eternal Sonship** and the Chalcedonian union can one account for a genuine humiliation and exaltation that secures both God's immutability and the reality of redemptive suffering.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence that **eternal Sonship is ontologically prior** to and constitutive for the incarnation - not merely a title applied at the economy.
 - Distinguishes carefully between *state* (humiliation/exaltation) and *essence* (divine immutability), preserving classical theism while explaining genuine kenosis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on kenoticists who speak of divine attribute-loss; argues for voluntary self-limitation rather than ontological diminution.
 - Counters adoptionist or "economic-only" readings of Sonship (including some Barthian tendencies) by reasserting real eternal relations.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise deployment of "humiliation" and "exaltation" as categories of the incarnate Son's *states* (temporal, salvific) while keeping language of eternal relations metaphysically robust.
 - Nuanced use of communicatio idiomatum to avoid both Nestorian separation and Monophysite absorption.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed seminaries as a corrective to kenotic/adoptionist trends; respected for exegetical clarity and confessional fidelity.
 - Less persuasive to radical Barthian interpreters and to theologians committed to strong kenotic metaphysics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, teachable articulation connecting Trinity and redemption; valuable for pastoral preaching on Philippians 2 and for classroom treatments of Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship**
 - The Son's perpetual being as Son by procession (begetting) from the Father; not a temporal status acquired at incarnation.
- **Eternal generation**
 - The classical metaphysical account of how the Son's relation to the Father is timeless and constitutive of personhood.
- **Incarnation**
 - The eternal Son's assumption of a real human nature while remaining fully divine; the locus of humiliation and exaltation.
- **Humiliation (kenosis)**
 - A *state* entered by the Son in the economy: voluntary self-limitation and receptive suffering, not loss of divine essence.
- **Exaltation**
 - The vindication and glorification of the incarnate Son culminating in resurrection, ascension, and session - consummating the redemptive work.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - The union of two complete natures (divine and human) in one person, allowing for true experience of humiliation and authentic agency in exaltation.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The scriptural and doctrinal principle enabling properties of both natures to be ascribed to the one person without confusion of natures.
- **Adoptionism**
 - The view that Jesus was made Son at adoption/Spirit descent; Macleod rejects this as insufficient to ground Christ's mediatorial identity.
- **Kenoticism (radical)**
 - The theory that God divested certain divine attributes in the incarnation; Macleod treats this as theologically problematic.
- **Chalcedonian definition**
 - The normative Christological formula Macleod employs as corrective and framework.
- **Intratrinitarian relations**
 - Real relations (Father-Son-Spirit) that exist eternally and condition the economy of salvation.
- **States of Christ**
 - Distinction between pre-incarnate, incarnate-humiliated, and exalted states - used to analyze economy without ontological change.
- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Defended in a compatible way with genuine incarnational suffering; Macleod holds to divine constancy while affirming real human passibility in the Son.
- **Philippians 2 / Johannine exegesis**
 - Employed as primary exegetical loci to demonstrate how the kenotic hymn and Johannine Son-language ground eternal Sonship and incarnation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching the classical doctrine of eternal Sonship within Reformed curricula.
- As a **polemic** against adoptionism and radical kenotic theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 and Johannine christology in systematic construction.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking intratrinitarian ontology to the economy of redemption in sermon preparation and seminary lectures.
