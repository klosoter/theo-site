### TITLE
The New Testament and Criticism (1967) - George Eldon Ladd

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century (1967): moment of intensive methodological ferment in New Testament studies - form criticism, redaction criticism, the quest for the historical Jesus, and Bultmannian demythologizing dominate debate.
 - Ladd writes from an evangelical academic posture seeking to mediate between rigorous historical-critical method and confessional concerns of the church.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Critical scholarship is necessary and legitimate, but must be disciplined by theological awareness: the New Testament must be read as historically grounded testimony that is also intrinsically theological, especially in its witness to the Kingdom and the church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Critique of extremes
 - Rejects naive literalism that refuses critical enquiry and rejects radical skepticism that evacuates the text of historical content.
 - Methodological proposal
 - Advocates a balanced use of historical-critical tools (form, redaction, source criticism) while maintaining attention to the theological intentions and canonical function of the NT writings.
 - Thematic focus: Kingdom and Church
 - Argues that proper criticism must account for the NT's eschatological thrust - the Kingdom motif shapes Christology and ecclesiology and resists reduction to merely ethical or mythological categories.
 - Practical consequences
 - Scholarly method has ecclesial implication: interpretation shapes preaching, doctrine, and mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Critical interlocutors: Rudolf Bultmann (demythologizing), members of the form- and redaction-critical schools (e.g., Wrede, Bornkamm, Käsemann), and liberal-critical trajectories stemming from Schweitzer.
 - Ladd brings into conversation evangelical exegetical traditions and contemporary critical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (scripture as witness and norm), Christology (historical Jesus and risen Lord), Eschatology (Kingdom of God as inaugurated and future), Ecclesiology (church as bearer of the kingdom), Hermeneutics (method and authority).
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically centered criticism reconciles historical integrity and theological significance, anchoring the church's identity in the New Testament's eschatological proclamation of the Kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong stress on the NT motif of the **Kingdom of God** as the exegetical key that unites Christology and ecclesiology in critical interpretation.
 - Emphasis on a middle path: rigorous historical inquiry that refuses reductionist naturalism and also resists fideistic anti-criticism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on Bultmannian existentialist re-interpretation that would strip the NT of objective historicity.
 - Critiques liberal tendencies that domesticate eschatology into mere ethical improvement or social progress.
 - Challenges fundamentalist distrust of critical methods by showing their necessity for serious theological retrieval.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Articulates and models what might be called a theologically informed historical criticism - an interpretive stance that treats historical facts and theological meaning as mutually informing rather than mutually exclusive.
 - Reinforces Ladd's broader program of **inaugurated eschatology** as a hermeneutical grid (already/not-yet) in critical work.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in evangelical academia as a constructive corrective to both liberal and fundamentalist excesses.
 - Influential in bridging evangelical scholars with mainline critical conversations, shaping later treatments of kingdom and church.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar for integrating historical-critical rigor with confessional theology, especially in studies linking NT eschatology and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God** - central interpretive category; theological and historical referent shaping Jesus' ministry and the NT witness.
- **Inaugurated eschatology (already/not-yet)** - hermeneutical framework Ladd employs to balance present reality of kingdom and its future consummation.
- **Historical criticism** - affirmed as necessary for establishing the NT's historical claims; to be used intelligently, not dogmatically.
- **Form criticism** - engaged critically: useful for discerning pre-literary forms but limited if it severs form from theological function.
- **Redaction criticism** - valuable for seeing authorial theology; Ladd insists redaction must account for historical cores, not only theological shaping.
- **Demythologizing** - addressed as both insightful (exposing mythic presuppositions) and potentially destructive when it denies objective historical events.
- **Hermeneutics** - method is both technical (history, linguistics) and theological (canonical and ecclesial reading).
- **Ecclesiology** - church understood as the present manifestation and agent of the kingdom; criticism must not neglect this lived aspect.
- **Christology** - historical Jesus and risen Christ both retained; critical work must honor narrative and kerygmatic testimony.
- **Revelation** - scripture as historical testimony to divine self-disclosure; criticism clarifies rather than negates revelation.
- **Canonical function** - calls for attention to the NT's role within the church's canon when engaging critical methods.
- **Critical realism** (implicit) - epistemological posture: history yields probable knowledge, not absolute skepticism nor naive certainty.
- **Polemic vs. constructive use** - book functions as corrective polemic against extremes and as constructive program for scholarly theology.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for integrating eschatology and ecclesiology in NT interpretation.
 - As a **polemic** against both demythologizing radicalism and anti-critical fundamentalism.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating balanced employment of form and redaction criticism informed by theological categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for courses and research on Church and Kingdom that require methodological clarity linking history and theology.
