### TITLE
The Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication (1646) - Samuel Rutherford

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century British Isles (English Civil War / Westminster era). Written from the Scottish Covenanter perspective in defence of Presbyterianism against Episcopal, Erastian, and Independent positions.
 - Part of intense debates over church-state relations, ecclesiastical jurisdiction, and the right to impose censures (notably excommunication).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Church government and the power to excommunicate are instituted by Christ and belong to the church under his headship; civil magistrates must not usurp ecclesiastical jurisdiction.**
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural warrant: Christ gave the keys and instituted officers and courts (appeals to Matthew 16, 18; Pauline practice of discipline).
 - Historical and patristic testimony: early church and Reformed practice support collective eldership and ecclesiastical censures.
 - Systematic-covenantal framing: church as covenant community requiring discipline to maintain visible holiness.
 - Practical-constitutional claim: distinct courts (sessions, presbyteries, synods) have jurisdiction to judge and excommunicate; magistrate may protect but not command doctrine or procedure.
 - Polemical refutation of rivals:
 - **Erastians** (state supremacy over church): denies magistrate right to order conscience or nullify discipline.
 - **Independents/Congregationalists**: defends collective presbyterial oversight vs. purely congregational autonomy.
 - **Prelatists/Episcopalians**: rejects hierarchical episcopal sovereignty as unbiblical.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interlocutors implied or named: Erastian writers of the day, Episcopal apologists (Arminian/Laudian tendencies), Congregationalists.
 - Sources: Scripture, Reformers (Calvin, Knox), Reformed confessions and Scottish practice, patristic and conciliar precedents.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (nature and marks of the visible church; offices and courts)
 - Authority (Christ as head; the keys; binding and loosing)
 - Covenant theology (church as covenant community; discipline as covenantal enforcement)
 - Sacramental and pastoral implications (exclusion from sacraments as a censure)
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Christ's exclusive headship requires a divinely ordained, corporate system of presbyterial government empowered to apply ecclesiastical censures (notably excommunication) to preserve the church's covenantal purity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong legal-political articulation of church courts as distinct jurisdictions with a divine warrant, not merely pragmatic orders.
 - Vivid defense of excommunication as a remedial and covenantal discipline, not vindictive punishment.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Moves beyond simple Reformed assertions of eldership to a vigorous public theology opposing state control (Erastianism) and congregational isolation (Independency).
 - Reclaims the language of "divine right" for a Reformed, covenantal polity rather than for monarchical or episcopal absolutism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing presbyterial authority in constitutional terms (courts, jurisdiction, appeals) - a proto-constitutional ecclesiology.
 - Tight coupling of covenant purity and procedural juridical forms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Scottish Presbyterianism and among many Westminster Divines; often cited in subsequent debates on Erastianism and church discipline.
 - Provoked rebuttals from Erastians and Independents; remains a touchstone for historic Presbyterian claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for understanding early modern church-state theory, the theological rationale for ecclesiastical discipline, and the historical development of Presbyterian polity.
 - Valuable pedagogically for linking biblical exegesis, covenant theology, and institutional design.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine right (of church government)** - claim that church structures and jurisdiction are instituted by Christ, not by civil law.
- **Excommunication** - corporate censure excluding a person from the visible covenant community and sacraments as remedial discipline.
- **Keys** - biblical concept (binding/loosing) used to ground ecclesiastical authority to discipline and admit.
- **Presbyterian polity** - government by assemblies of elders (session, presbytery, synod), collective jurisdiction.
- **Covenant purity** - standard that discipline serves to preserve the church's covenantal integrity and visible holiness.
- **Magistrate (civil)** - differentiated role; may protect church order but must not adjudicate doctrine or command ecclesiastical censures.
- **Erastianism** - the rival position denying independent ecclesiastical jurisdiction; Rutherford's treatise is a corrective polemic.
- **Independency / Congregationalism** - rival ecclesiology emphasizing local autonomy; contrasted with representative, connected courts.
- **Offices (elders, ministers)** - theological justification for ordained, differentiated functionaries in ruling and teaching.
- **Jurisdiction / courts** - legal-concept language applied to church assemblies and their authority.
- **Remedial discipline** - theological rationale for censures as medicine for sin, aiming at restoration.
- **Visible vs. invisible church** - maintained distinction; discipline pertains to visible membership.
- **Binding and loosing** - practical application: doctrinal and moral adjudications binding in church life.
- **Appeals** - mechanism within presbyterial structures for justice and unity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary **definition source** for historic Presbyterian polity and the theology of ecclesiastical censures.
- As a **polemic** against Erastianism and Independency in church-state debates.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for treating Matthew 16/18, Pauline discipline, and covenantal restoration procedures.
