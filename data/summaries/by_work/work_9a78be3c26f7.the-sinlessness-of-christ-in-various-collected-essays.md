### TITLE
The Sinlessness of Christ - essays by Herman Bavinck (on the Impeccability of Christ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Dutch Reformed theology; Bavinck writing amid neo-Calvinist renewal and dialogue with modern biblical criticism, historical theology, and German dogmatics.
 - Positioned in his larger systematic efforts to defend classical Reformed Christology against liberalizing, rationalistic, and extreme kenotic tendencies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ is truly sinless: he did not commit sin and was by nature free from inherited corruption. This sinlessness is necessary for his work as Redeemer (both active and passive obedience).
 - The specific focus: the **impeccability** question - in what sense could Christ be tempted and yet not capable of sinning; did he possess the genuine freedom to sin (peccability) or was he constitutionally unable (impeccability)?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural-theological proof: New Testament testimony to Christ's sinlessness and temptations (e.g., Hebrews, Luke, Romans typology).
 - Christology and metaphysics: appeal to the hypostatic union - the union of divine and human natures constrains the moral horizon of the incarnate Son such that sin would contradict the unified person and redemptive mission.
 - Anthropology of Christ: affirmation of full genuine humanity (real appetite, will, vulnerability to suffering) but denial of inherited concupiscence and propensity to sin.
 - Practical theodicy and soteriology: sinlessness is required for propitiatory atonement and exemplar righteousness; only one without sin could be mediator and representative head.
 - Engagement with alternatives: critiques of views that either undermine real temptation (making Christ only apparently tempted) or that posit a sinful possibility that would threaten the assurance and efficacy of redemption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed scholastic and patristic tradition (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodox writers), medieval scholastics (Aquinas), and contemporary critics (historical-critical scholarship, kenotic theologians).
 - Bavinck dialogues with theologians who emphasize peccability (some modern liberals or speculative kenotists) and with traditions that over-spiritualize the incarnation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures), anthropology (human will and temptation), soteriology (active and passive obedience), Trinity insofar as divine attributes bear on incarnation, and providence/temptation.

- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers the argument: the Son was truly tempted as a real man yet remained sinless - an imperative Christological truth because only an unblemished, obedient Mediator can secure reconciliation for sinful humanity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Careful distinction between "real freedom" and "propensity to sin": Christ's freedom is genuine yet not orientated by corrupted inclinations.
 - Balanced insistence that temptations were real (not mere appearances) but not rooted in hereditary sinfulness.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counterposes his view to radical kenotic readings that make Christ morally vulnerable in ways that imperil the atonement.
 - Corrects any notion that the incarnation required loss of moral integrity or of essential divine properties; instead, the union secures moral coherence.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Sharp use of terms like **impeccability** (inability to sin by virtue of person/office) vs. **peccability** (real capacity to sin), while preserving real human subjectivity and testing.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Reinforced classical Reformed positions in 20th-century conservative theology; used by later Reformed systematicians as a careful model of integrating biblical exegesis, metaphysics, and pastoral soteriology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a disciplined template for treating difficult Christological paradoxes (real temptation + sinlessness) and for defending the necessity of sinlessness for redemptive efficacy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability** - the doctrine that Christ did not and could not sin; Bavinck treats it as consistent with true humanity.
- **Peccability** - the rival claim that Christ could have sinned; Bavinck critiques versions that make sinfulness ontologically possible.
- **Hypostatic union** - central explanatory principle: the personal union of two natures secures the coherence of sinlessness and real temptation.
- **Temptation (peirasmos)** - presented as real external/internal trials from world, flesh, and devil; genuine but not rooted in inherited corruption.
- **Concupiscence** - Bavinck denies inherited concupiscence in Christ; distinguishes natural appetites from sinful inclinations.
- **Active obedience** - Christ's ongoing obedience in life required for legal/forensic righteousness credited to believers.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and death as vicarious atonement; presupposes sinlessness for acceptability to God.
- **Kenosis** - treated critically: Bavinck resists interpretations that empty divine properties to the point of jeopardizing sinlessness or deity.
- **Representative/federal headship** - Christ as true Israel/Adam substitute; his sinlessness is necessary for representative righteousness.
- **Exemplar vs. Substitute** - Bavinck allows Christ as moral example but insists substitutionary atonement is primary and presupposes sinlessness.
- **Freedom of the will** - affirmed in Christ; genuine moral freedom without sinful predisposition.
- **Mediation** - Christ's sinless person is constitutive for his mediatorial efficacy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations of impeccability and its constraints.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberalizing kenoticism and caricatures that deny real temptation or humanity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading NT data on temptation and sinlessness (Hebrews, Luke, Paul).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology and soteriology: sinlessness is both doctrinally necessary and pastorally secure for assurance.
