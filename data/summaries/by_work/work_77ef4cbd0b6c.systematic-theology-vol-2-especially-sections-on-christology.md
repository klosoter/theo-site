### TITLE
Systematic Theology, Vol. 2 (Christology sections) - Author Unknown

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** anonymous volume in a confessional Protestant systematic tradition; reads as a mid-to-late modern academic synthesis drawing on patristic, scholastic, and Reformation sources to frame classical Christology for doctrinal teaching and pastoral application.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to demonstrate that the one Person of Christ (the God‑Man) must be understood by the Chalcedonian hypostatic union, the communicatio idiomatum, and the threefold office (munus triplex) so that soteriology, worship, and ecclesial identity are coherently grounded.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - exegetical groundwork in OT and NT Christological texts (Titles, Isaiah, Pauline and Johannine christology);
 - canonical and conciliar synthesis: explication of the Chalcedonian formula and its logical implications for person and nature;
 - ontological account of the hypostatic union (one hypostasis, two natures);
 - doctrinal handling of the communicatio idiomatum - criteria, limits, and pastoral uses;
 - functional integration: how the divine‑human union enables Christ's **munus triplex** (Prophet, Priest, King) and secures atonement, intercession, and reign;
 - practical consequences for sacraments, preaching, and pastoral office.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - primary conciliar: Chalcedonian Definition (451);
 - scholastic: Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae on the personal union and communicatio idiomatum);
 - Reformation: John Calvin on Christ's offices (munus triplex) and pastoral implications;
 - patristic witnesses (Athanasius, Cyril) and later Protestant confessions as background interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person & natures), Trinitarian relations as background, Incarnation, Atonement (soteriology), Offices of Christ (munus triplex), communicatio idiomatum, sacraments and Christ's mediatorial activity.
- **Closing line:** The volume centers the God‑man as the sole ontological and soteriological nexus: the hypostatic union orders doctrine and devotion so that the communicatio idiomatum and the threefold office together make Christ both the agent and object of our redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - stresses a disciplined, juridical and ontological reading of the hypostatic union - neither collapsing natures nor atomizing the person;
 - integrates functional doctrine (munus triplex) directly into the doctrine of the person instead of treating offices only as soteriological roles.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - corrects perceived Lutheran over‑extension of communicatio idiomatum (which can blur properties) by setting careful exegetical and philosophical limits;
 - opposes Nestorian division of the person and Monophysite absorption of natures by insisting on Chalcedonian safeguards.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - proposes a pragmatic rubric (here called "functional‑hypostatic integration") to read offices as natural outworkings of the personhood of Christ rather than detachable functions.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - used in seminary Christology courses as a synthetic bridge between classical conciliar theology and Reformation pastoral concerns;
 - valued by Reformed teachers for its clear articulation of munus triplex; by ecumenical conversations for its Chalcedonian fidelity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - provides a compact pedagogical model linking person and work; strong for preaching formation, sacramental theology, and polemical defense against Christological errors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** the union of two distinct natures (divine and human) in the one Person (hypostasis) of Christ.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** the exchange or attribution of properties between Christ's natures permitting, e.g., divine acts to be ascribed to the man and human experiences to the person of the Son - treated with principled limits.
 - emphasis on **non‑confusion** and **non‑separation** (Chalcedonian restraints).
- **Munus Triplex (threefold office):** Christ's offices as Prophet, Priest, and King - explained as functions that flow from the hypostatic union and ground soteriological activity.
- **Chalcedonian Formula:** the fourth‑century definition that secures the doctrinal framework: two natures in one person, without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Person (Hypostasis):** the unique subject in which both natures subsist; the locus for predication and redemptive agency.
- **Nature (Physis):** what is shared by instances (divine nature, human nature); distinguished from person to avoid Nestorianism.
- **Kenosis:** the self‑emptying of the Son in incarnation - treated as compatible with divine immutability and without loss of deity.
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** the formula invoked in Reformed debates to express the divine Word's transcendence even in the incarnation (discussed by the volume in relation to communicatio limits).
- **Implications for Sacraments:** Christ's presence and efficacy in sacraments are grounded in the person‑works relation secured by the hypostatic union.
- **Atonement language:** Penal, substitutionary, and representative aspects are all read through the lens of the one Person who acts.
- **Attributes vs. Relations:** careful semantic rules for ascribing properties (e.g., "God suffers" is predicated of the person in his human nature, not of the divine nature).
- **Polemic against errors:** explicit criteria for distinguishing robust communicatio from confounding of natures.
- **Pastoral articulation:** how Christ's threefold office informs preaching, pastoral care, and ecclesial authority.

How this work is used across loci:
- as a **definition source** for post‑conciliar Christological categories (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum);
- as a **polemic resource** against Nestorianism, Monophysitism, and modern reductions of the person of Christ;
- as an **exegetical/modeling tool** for reading NT predications of Christ's actions and attributes (foundation for sacramental and pastoral theology).
