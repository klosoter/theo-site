### TITLE
Discussions in Church Polity - Charles Hodge

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-to-late 19th-century American Reformed/Princeton milieu. Hodge writes from the perspective of conservative Presbyterian orthodoxy shaped by the Westminster Standards, Enlightenment-era historical method, and a context of denominational disputes (Presbyterian vs. Congregational and Episcopal models; debates over church-state relations and discipline).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To defend and articulate a scriptural, historical, and confessional case for Presbyterian church government and the accompanying doctrines of the visible church, discipline, and sacramental practice against rival models (episcopacy, congregationalism, and Erastian subordination to the state).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical grounding: biblical warrant for plurality of elders, parity of ruling and teaching elders, representative assemblies (presbytery/synod).
 - Historical-defense: continuity with Reformation and patristic precedent as interpreted by Reformed confessions.
 - Practical consequences: the necessity of church discipline, the proper administration of sacraments as covenant signs and seals, and limits on civil magistrate interference.
 - Polemical moves: critique of Erastianism (state control of church), critique of congregational voluntarism and of episcopal hierarchical claims.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (New Testament polity texts), Westminster Confession and Larger/Shorter Catechisms, Reformers (Calvin), selected Church Fathers, contemporary American denominations (Presbyterian, Congregationalist, Episcopal), and political-theological debates over church/state.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (visible vs. invisible church, marks of the church), offices (elders, ministers, deacons), church discipline, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper) within covenant theology, civil magistrate/church relations, and implicit eschatological framing for mission and culture.
- **Closing line:** A confessional, exegetical, and historical defense of Presbyterian polity that situates the church as a covenantal, disciplined, sacramental community distinct from but influential upon civil society.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *parity and plurality* of eldership as both biblical and necessary for congregational health.
 - Treatment of church discipline not as punitive alone but as covenantal and formative for the visible church's purity.
 - Clear articulation of sacraments as *signs and seals* within a covenantal framework rather than merely memorial acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects congregationalist voluntarism by grounding corporate authority in Scripture and covenant.
 - Opposes both high episcopacy (jurisdictional bishops) and total Erastian subordination of church to state, arguing for distinct but cooperative spheres.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Robust integration of systematic theology categories (covenant, means of grace, visible/invisible church) into practical polity discussions, making ecclesiology a locus of systematic concern not merely church order.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Deeply influential in American Presbyterianism and at Princeton Seminary; served as a touchstone for confessional conservatives in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
 - Used widely in debates over union, reunion, and the limits of civil authority in ecclesial affairs.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Remains a clear, compact model for teaching Reformed ecclesiology and defending Presbyterian polity with confessional and biblical arguments; valuable for students needing an integrated approach to doctrine and church practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterian polity:** Representative government by elders; sessions, presbyteries, synods as ordered, biblical structures.
- **Elders (ruling and teaching):** Distinction between office functions but parity in governance; collective oversight of congregation.
- **Session / Presbytery / Synod:** Local and regional assemblies for adjudication, discipline, and oversight; the institutional backbone of Presbyterian order.
- **Visible church:** The outward, covenantal community subject to discipline and sacraments; distinguished from the invisible church of the elect.
 - Relation to invisible church: visible church judged by marks and covenantal fidelity, not presumed election.
- **Marks of the church:** Preaching of the Word, administration of sacraments, and exercise of discipline as indicators of true ecclesial identity.
- **Church discipline:** Covenantal corrective and preservative practice; necessary for purity and witness.
- **Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper):** Signs and seals of the covenant; means of grace within corporate life.
- **Covenant theology:** The theological framework linking sacraments, church membership, and family religion.
- **Erastianism:** The view of state supremacy over church; Hodge rejects this as inconsistent with biblical polity.
- **Church-state relations:** Distinct spheres with mutual obligation; civil magistrate should support Christianity without usurping ecclesial jurisdiction.
- **Representative assemblies:** Theologically justified mechanisms for common discipline and doctrinal unity across congregations.
- **Voluntarism:** The idea that the church is merely an association of consenting individuals; critiqued for undermining covenantal obligations.
- **Confessionalism (Westminster):** Use of confessions as normative interpretive guides for polity and doctrine.
- **Means of grace:** The sacraments and Word, held central to the church's life and identity.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed/Presbyterian polity and office theology.
 - As a **polemic** against Erastian and voluntarist models of church order.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading New Testament polity texts in light of covenant theology and confessional standards.
