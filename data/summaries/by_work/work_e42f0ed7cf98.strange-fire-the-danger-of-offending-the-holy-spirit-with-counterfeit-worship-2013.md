### TITLE
Strange Fire: The Danger of Offending the Holy Spirit with Counterfeit Worship (John F. MacArthur, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid renewed public controversies over Pentecostal/Charismatic phenomena (early 21st-century surge in "signs and wonders," Bethel-style revivalism, and the New Apostolic Reformation).
 - Emerged from and accompanied the 2013 Strange Fire conference hosted by MacArthur; aimed at conservative Evangelical and Reformed audiences alarmed by experientialism.
- **Central thesis**
 - Much contemporary charismatic practice is unbiblical, often counterfeit or demonic, and risks "offending the Holy Spirit" and corrupting worship and doctrine. True supernatural gifts, MacArthur argues, ceased with the apostolic era.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses: documents widespread charismatic phenomena (prophecy, tongues, miraculous healings, "glory" experiences) and pastoral/evangelical complicity.
 - Biblical exegesis: reads Leviticus 10 ("strange fire"), Acts, and 1 Corinthians (esp. chs. 12-14) to argue for normative patterns of Spirit activity and gift cessation.
 - Historical/theological argument: appeals to patristic, post-apostolic, and Reformation-era patterns to contest modern continuationism.
 - Practical pastoral outworking: warns against putting experiential phenomena over Scripture, prescribes discernment, reasserts worship regulation and church order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: contemporary charismatic leaders and movements (e.g., Bill Johnson/Bethel, Todd Bentley, Benny Hinn), and high-profile continuationist theologians (representatively Wayne Grudem, Sam Storms, Jack Deere).
 - Sources: Scripture as primary, augmented by historical theology (cessationist voices), case studies, and eyewitness reports.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Spirit: the nature, purpose, and limits of charismatic gifts; biblical sufficiency.
 - Holy Spirit: personhood, role in worship, and relation to Scripture.
 - Ecclesiology and worship: authority, order, and regulative concerns.
 - Soteriology and sanctification implications where experientialism influences assurance and practice.
- **Closing line**
 - MacArthur's theological center: fidelity to Scripture and orderly worship requires rejecting modern charismatic excesses and defending a cessationist, discerning pastoral response to alleged supernatural phenomena.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses the Leviticus "strange fire" motif as the central prophetic indictment of illicit worship and Spirit-offending practices.
 - Emphasizes pastoral responsibility to rebuke and expose false manifestations, not merely debate them.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Directly confronts contemporary continuationists on hermeneutics and pastoral consequences, arguing they misplace subjective experience above objective Scripture.
 - Contrasts with charismatic theology that privileges ongoing apostolic-style revelation and public prophecy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframing modern charismatic phenomena as potential acts that "offend the Holy Spirit" - a pastoral and moral indictment, not merely a doctrinal dispute.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed and cessationist circles; used as a rallying and training resource.
 - Received strong critiques from charismatics and some evangelicals for polemical tone, alleged caricature of continuationist positions, and selective use of evidence.
 - Sparked extensive public debate, follow-up responses, and counter-publications from continuationist theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - A clear, rhetorically forceful exemplar of contemporary cessationist polemic; useful for studying modern conflict between experientialism and sola scriptura priorities.
 - Provokes necessary questions about discernment, ecclesiastical authority, and the pastoral consequences of doctrinal divergence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Strange fire"**
 - Central metaphor (Leviticus 10) for illicit, unauthorized worship practices that risk judgment.
- **"Offending the Holy Spirit"**
 - Moral charge: practices that grieve, misrepresent, or provoke the Spirit's holiness.
- **Cessationism**
 - Thesis that revelatory and sign gifts (apostolic miracles, tongues as sign-language, public prophecy with canonical authority) ceased with the apostolic age.
- **Continuationism**
 - Opposed view allowing for ongoing charismatic gifts; treated as hermeneutically and pastorally problematic in the book.
- **Charismatic gifts**
 - Tongues, prophecy, healing, and signs - analyzed for biblical warrant and church order.
- **Signs and wonders**
 - Scrutinized for authenticity and theological role; often linked to revival authenticity claims.
- **Experientialism**
 - Prioritizing subjective spiritual experience over Scripture; identified as root problem.
- **New Apostolic Reformation (NAR)**
 - Cited as an influential movement promoting contemporary apostolic authority and miraculous claims.
- **Discernment**

- **Sola Scriptura / biblical sufficiency**
 - Used as the foundational hermeneutic to nullify extra-biblical revelations or authority claims.
- **Prophecy (ecclesiastical)**
 - Distinguished between New Testament prophetic function and modern claims; criticized when authoritative or canon-forming.
- **Worship authenticity**
 - Concern for purity, order, and theological content of worship against emotive excesses.
- **Demonization risk**
 - The claim that counterfeit phenomena can be demonic or deceptive, requiring church vigilance.
- **Pastoral accountability**

 - As a training resource for pastors and elders on discernment, worship regulation, and pastoral responses to claimed miracles.
 - As an exegetical model for reading 1 Corinthians/Acts through a cessationist lens and for framing contemporary debates on Spirit gifts.
