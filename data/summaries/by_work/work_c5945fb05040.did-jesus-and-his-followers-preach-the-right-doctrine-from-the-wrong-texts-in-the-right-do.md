### TITLE
Did Jesus and His Followers Preach the Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts? - Gregory K. Beale (in The Right Doctrine from the Wrong Texts?, 1994)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contribution to an edited volume addressing the charge that New Testament theology rests on misapplied Old Testament proofs.
 - Situated in late 20th-century debates over biblical inspiration, inerrancy, and hermeneutics; interacts implicitly with historical-critical readings and with Second Temple Jewish interpretive practices.
 - Conversation partners include conservative defenders of scriptural authority and scholars analyzing NT citation practice.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The claim that Jesus and the apostles taught correct doctrine from "wrong" or illegitimate uses of Old Testament texts is misguided: their use of Scripture is hermeneutically legitimate, theologically coherent, and consonant with the doctrine of inspiration.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrates that NT citation and allusion must be read in the context of ancient interpretive norms (e.g., typology, midrashic techniques), not by modern strictures alone.
 - Argues for a canonical and Christocentric hermeneutic: Scripture interprets Scripture; NT interpreters read the OT in light of redemptive-historical fulfilment.
 - Maintains that apparent alterations or selective quotations do not indicate error but reflect authorized theological appropriation under the Spirit.
 - Concludes that Jesus and the apostles' methods preserve doctrinal truth and therefore do not undercut claims about inspiration and inerrancy.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Second Temple interpretive practices (typology, pesher, midrash) as descriptive background.
 - Engages critics who allege irresponsible proof-texting or "wrong texts" use by NT authors.
 - Implicitly converses with modern biblical critics and defenders of inerrancy; dialog with canonical and redemptive-historical interpreters.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Inspiration**: NT use demonstrates Spirit-guided interpretation.
 - **Inerrancy**: Apparent textual deviations do not impugn truthfulness when understood in context.
 - **Christology**: Christ as the fulfillment-center for OT meaning.
 - **Canonical theology / Revelation**: Unity and progressive unfolding of revelation; Scripture's internal interpretive authority.

- **Closing line**
 - Beale affirms that the New Testament's Christ-centered, canonical reading of the Old Testament secures doctrinal truth and vindicates claims about inspiration even where modern readers perceive nonliteral or unusual quotation practices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses a canonical, Christocentric hermeneutic that treats NT appropriation of the OT as normative for doctrine.
 - Emphasizes the legitimacy of typology and theological reading as instruments of inspired interpretation.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on critics who treat NT citation as sloppy or exegetically illicit by reframing the issue as one of differing hermeneutical presuppositions rather than simple textual error.
 - Contrasts modern historical-critical expectations (strict authorial intent = only legitimate meaning) with ancient communal and canonical reading practices.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys a functional account of citation: meaning is not exhausted by original Sitz im Leben but includes authoritative canonical fulfillment and theological reapplication.
 - Elevates the category of "inspired appropriation" - the notion that Spirit-guided interpreters can reapply prior texts in fulfillment contexts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and evangelical scholars advocating a canonical and typological hermeneutic.
 - Cited in debates on inerrancy and the legitimacy of NT use of OT proof-texts; used as a corrective to overly narrow historical-linguistic hermeneutics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear defense of how inspiration and inerrancy cohere with ancient citation practices.
 - Useful for teaching canonical, christocentric approaches to biblical theology and for responding to critiques that invoke "wrong texts."

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - Scripture as Spirit-directed; NT citation is viewed as Spirit-authorized appropriation.
- **Inerrancy** - Truthfulness of Scripture upheld despite nonverbatim quotations when interpreted canonically.
- **Typology** - The practice of seeing OT persons/events as foreshadowing NT realities; central to Beale's defense.
- **Midrash / Pesher (Second Temple hermeneutics)** - Historical interpretive modes that legitimize creative reapplication of texts.
- **Canonical hermeneutic** - Reading the OT within the unity of the canon and fulfillment in Christ.
- **Christocentric reading / fulfillment** - OT meaning is understood in relation to Christ's person and work.
- **Proof-texting** - Use of single OT verses to establish doctrine; defended when done within canonical-theological parameters.
- **Textual appropriation** - The concept that inspired authors reapply earlier texts for new covenant fulfillment.
- **Authorial intent (ancient vs. modern)** - Beale contrasts ancient communal/typological intent with modern exclusive focus on original intent.
- **Meaning-in-use** - The idea that Scripture's authoritative meaning includes how it is used within the canon.
- **Redemptive-historical context** - Interpreting texts as episodes within a progressive revelation leading to Christ.
- **Theological citation** - Citations serve theological purposes, not merely lexical or historical citation accuracy.
- **Hermeneutical legitimacy** - Criteria for judging whether an interpretive move is acceptable within the faith community.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for canonical/typological hermeneutics and for articulating "inspired appropriation."
 - As **polemic** against critiques that NT use of the OT invalidates inerrancy.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and scholarship that treat OT citations as theologically loaded, Christ-centered acts of interpretation.
