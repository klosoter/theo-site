### TITLE
Crossing the Threshold of Divine Revelation - William J. Abraham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century anglophone theological reflection on authority, hermeneutics, and the nature of revelation (post-Enlightenment epistemic crisis; interaction with analytic philosophy of language and continental concerns about tradition and community).
 - Abraham writes from a broadly Methodist/Wesleyan vantage but addresses ecumenical interlocutors in Protestant theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Revelation is best understood not as raw propositions nor as merely subjective religious experience but as a **relational, ecclesially mediated event** in which God discloses himself through the Word (ultimately Christ) as received within the life and practices of the church - a crossing of a human threshold into responsive communion.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic critique: surveys and criticizes dominant models (propositional/foundationalist, existential/inner-experience, and some liberal/social-constructionist accounts).
 - Theoretical resources: draws on speech-act theory, language-community insights (Wittgensteinian resonances), and classical theological categories (Word, Spirit, covenant).
 - Positive construction: develops an **ecclesial-linguistic** account of revelation as event:
 - Revelation occurs when God speaks in history (Christ) and that speech is enacted and recognized within the church by the Spirit.
 - Scripture, proclamation, sacrament, and tradition are constitutive practices through which the church crosses the threshold into divine disclosure.
 - Practical implications: authority, hermeneutics, pastoral proclamation, and doctrinal formation must be reframed on non-foundational, covenantal grounds.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformers and patristic categories (Word, sacrament), interacts critically with Karl Barth, liberal and existential theologians, and contemporary analytic philosophers of language and epistemology.
 - Dialogues with scholarship on tradition, canon, and ecclesial authority (implicit contact with Brevard Childs, Lesslie Newbigin, speech-act theorists).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture and Word, Trinity (Word and Spirit), pneumatology (witness and enabling), ecclesiology (church as locus), covenant, authority, hermeneutics.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **revelation is the dynamic, Spirit-enabled crossing of the church into the disclosure of the Triune God - a communal event that grounds authority, Scripture, and Christian identity.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The persistent use of the **threshold** metaphor to capture the moment of reception: revelation is eventful and participatory rather than merely propositional or private.
 - Strong insistence that **the church, not isolated cognition, is the primary locus of revelation**; authority is ecclesial and covenantal.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back on **propositional foundationalism** (scripture as a set of self-evident premises) and on individualistic existential readings that privatize encounter with God.
 - Corrects naive social constructivism by retaining a robust divine initiative - God truly speaks and is not merely a function of communal invention.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Ecclesial-linguistic model" and framing revelation as a **revelation-event** enacted by speech-acts within Christian practices.
 - Integration of pneumatological criteria for recognition of divine speech (Spirit as enabler of crossing).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in anglophone ecclesiology and systematic theology debates as a corrective to both liberal and overly rationalist accounts of revelation.
 - Cited in Wesleyan/Methodist circles, used by some Reformed theologians seeking a non-foundational account of authority; engaged by evangelicals interested in the interplay of Word and community.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust middle path: preserves divine initiative and objective content while accounting for mediation, tradition, and communal discernment; fruitful for preaching, sacramental theology, and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Threshold** - the decisive moment/act of responsive reception whereby a person/community enters into divine disclosure.
- **Revelation-event** - revelation conceived as an enacted occurrence, not merely written propositions or inner states.
- **Ecclesial-linguistic model** - the framework locating revelation within the language and practices of the church.
- **Word (Christ, Scripture, proclamation)** - the incarnate Word is primary; Scripture and proclamation mediate that Word within the church.
- **Pneumatological witness** - the Spirit enables recognition and appropriation of divine speech; criterion for genuine revelation.
- **Non-foundational epistemology** - rejects the need for ultimate, context-free epistemic grounds; authority is covenantal and communal.
- **Covenantal Lordship** - God's self-disclosure establishes a binding relationship that grounds authority and obedience.
- **Speech-act language** - use of performative theory to explain how divine speech effects reality (e.g., promise, call).
- **Canonical reception** - Scripture's authority is shaped by its reception and use in the church's life and worship.
- **Sacramentality** - sacraments are constitutive practices in which revelation is enacted and appropriated.
- **Tradition / interpretive community** - hermeneutic practices are communal; reading faithfulness is a practiced activity.
- **Propositionalism (critique)** - the view that revelation reduces to discrete truth-claims that Abraham resists.
- **Existential encounter (contrast)** - the inward-feeling model of revelation that Abraham sees as insufficient without ecclesial mediation.
- **Authority (ecclesial)** - authority rooted in the church's faithful witnessing to Christ rather than independent foundations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for an ecclesial, event-centered account of revelation and authority.
- As a **polemic** against propositional foundationalism and privatized experience models.
- As an **exegetical and hermeneutical model** guiding preaching, canonical reading, and sacramental theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on revelation, ecclesiology, and theological method to bridge analytic and pastoral concerns.
