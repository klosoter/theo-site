### TITLE
**The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)** - Friedrich Schleiermacher (1821-1822)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century Protestant Germany; post-Kantian, Romantic and Idealist intellectual milieu.
 - Reaction to Enlightenment rationalism and orthodox scholasticism; attempt to rearticulate Christian doctrine for modern consciousness.
 - Published 1821-22 as Schleiermacher's mature systematic theology, following his earlier Essays on Religion and Hermeneutics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must ground doctrines in the lived, immediate religion of the believer: the **feeling of absolute dependence** (Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit) is the essence of religion.
 - Dogma becomes the articulation of this religious self-consciousness as mediated historically in Christ and the Church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method and principles - religion located in feeling; critique of purely metaphysical or moral accounts.
 - Part II: Doctrinal explication - God, Christ, redemption, Spirit, Church, sacraments, eschatology, each reframed as expressions of religious consciousness.
 - Major moves:
 - Define religion psychologically (feeling) and sociologically (community).
 - Read revelation in terms of religious self-communication rather than propositional metaphysics.
 - Reconstruct classical loci (Trinity, Christology, soteriology) as theological interpretations of the Christian community's experience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Philosophical interlocutors: Kant, Fichte, Schleiermacher's contemporaries in German Idealism and Romanticism.
 - Theological interlocutors: Enlightenment rationalists, Pietists, orthodox Lutheran and Reformed scholastics.
 - Uses Scripture as theological resource but read through hermeneutics shaped by philosophical anthropology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, God, Trinity; Christology (incarnation, person of Christ); sin and redemption; Spirit and pneumatology; Church and sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper); eschatological anthropology (resurrection, eternal life).

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher centers theology on **religious experience**: doctrines are faithful reconstructions of the Christian community's self-conscious encounter with the divine, mediated decisively in Christ and sustained by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Religion defined primarily as **feeling** (absolute dependence), not first as assent to propositions or moral law.
 - Theology as description and systematization of communal religious consciousness; doctrine explicates religious life.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects rationalist reduction of religion to ethics and dogmatic scholastic metaphysics.
 - Critiques pietistic subjectivism by insisting on historical mediation (Scripture, Church) for individual religious feeling.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as foundational category.
 - Reinterpretation of Christ's person as the perfect religious self-consciousness rather than primarily metaphysical Logos-Christology.
 - Pneumatology centered on the Spirit as vivifying communal consciousness and revelation, not merely an abstract third person.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Enormous influence on liberal theology, modern Protestant hermeneutics, and homiletics.
 - Criticized by 20th-century neo-orthodoxy (Barth) for subjectivism and alleged relativizing of objective revelation.
 - Revived interest for historical-critical and constructive theology; central text for understanding modern Protestant liberalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological clarity about theology's hermeneutical and anthropological bases.
 - Provokes ongoing debates about experience vs. propositional revelation, ecclesial mediation, and the nature of doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of Absolute Dependence**
 - Core category: the basic religious state from which theology proceeds.
- **Religious Self-Consciousness**
 - The communal and individual awareness that doctrines articulate.
- **Revelation**
 - Event and mediation: Christ as the decisive revelation of God to human religious consciousness; Scripture and Church as mediatory forms.
- **Christ (Incarnation)**
 - Jesus as the paradigmatic human in whom divine religious self-consciousness is fully realized; emphasizes experiential union over metaphysical formulas.
- **Eternal Sonship**
 - Reinterpreted: focus on Christ's role in history and consciousness rather than ontological metaphysics of eternal generation.
- **Sin**
 - Primarily a failure or deformation of God-consciousness - alienation in the life of feeling and community.
- **Holy Spirit**
 - Principle of communal life, revelation, and illumination; the Spirit vivifies the Church's shared religious consciousness.
- **Church**
 - The locus of sustained religious self-consciousness; sacramental community that mediates the Spirit and revelation.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper)**
 - Signs and seals that cultivate and express communal religious consciousness; efficacy tied to the Spirit and ecclesial life rather than magical causality.
 - On **baptism**: supports infant baptism as incorporation into the believing community, efficacy understood communally and subjectively.
- **Eschatological Anthropology / Resurrection**
 - Future consummation described in terms of perfected religious life and restored God-consciousness.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source for liberal theology and theological anthropology (experience-centered).
 - Polemic and corrective against both rationalist and pietist extremes; used as a foil by neo-orthodox critics.
 - Model for doctrinal reconstruction that prioritizes hermeneutical method and the socio-spiritual nature of revelation.
