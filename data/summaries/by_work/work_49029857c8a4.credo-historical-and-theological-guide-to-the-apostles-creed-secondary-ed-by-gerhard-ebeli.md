### TITLE
Rudolf Bultmann - essay on the Apostles' Creed in Credo: Historical and Theological Guide to the Apostles' Creed (ed. Gerhard Ebeling)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century Protestant theology; written in the context of post-war German scholarship, existential hermeneutics, and form-criticism. Appears in Ebeling's edited volume as a secondary contribution aimed at historicizing and interpreting the Creed for modern faith.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the Apostles' Creed must be read as kerygmatic confession suited to existential appropriation rather than as a catalogue of metaphysical propositions; its trinitarian and christological language functions primarily to articulate the saving event of God in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose modern readers' difficulty with creedal language (mythic elements, metaphysical categories).
 - Employ kerygmatic hermeneutic: the Creed is proclamation (kerygma) that elicits existential decision (faith) rather than speculative knowledge.
 - Trace historical layers of the Creed to show its pastoral/communal function and resist treating later doctrinal accretions (e.g., Filioque) as essential to the existential center.
 - Re-locate doctrines (Trinity, Christology, Resurrection) as indispensable but to be read as existentially revelatory statements about the saving act rather than scientific history.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages patristic creedal tradition, later Western formulations (implicitly including Filioque controversies), contemporaries like Karl Barth and Gerhard Ebeling; methodological debt to form criticism and Heideggerian existentialism shapes his reading.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (Christ as center of proclamation), Resurrection and Ascension (kerygmatic event), Trinity (doctrinal formulation as interpretive device), revelation and faith (existential appropriation), ecclesial confession and sacramental/communal function of creed.
- **Closing line:** Read existentially, the Apostles' Creed is not an appendix to speculative theology but the church's concise kerygmatic word that summons existential faith in the saving act of God in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **kerygma over dogma**: creedal sentences are performative calls to faith rather than propositions to be subsumed under metaphysical systems.
 - Stresses the **existential reception** of the Creed: meaning unfolds in the believer's decision and life, not merely in doctrinal assent.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts with systematic theologians who treat creeds as theological syllogisms (e.g., scholastic formulations), and with patristic metaphysical inclinations that reify creedal language.
 - Differs from Barth in method: while Barth also centers revelation, Bultmann insists on interpretive, existential appropriation and is more critical of metaphysical formulations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes creedal language within the vocabulary of **demythologization** (not abolition of myth but reinterpretation) and **kerygmatic hermeneutics**.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Influential among mid-20th-century Protestant exegetes and theological historians; provoked debate about historical-critical methods vs. confessional orthodoxy.
 - Sparked critical re-evaluations of how creeds function pastorally and ecumenically; criticized by conservative confessionalists for perceived reductionism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a disciplined model for reading creeds as living confession; valuable for courses on hermeneutics, doctrinal development, and faith-and-history issues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma:** the proclamation of God's saving act in Christ; for Bultmann the primary category for interpreting creeds.
- **Demythologization:** reinterpretation of mythic language to uncover existential truth rather than literal elimination of mythic form.
- **Existential appropriation:** faith as personal, existential decision in response to the Creed's proclamation.
- **Form criticism:** methodological lens that distinguishes original kerygmatic units from later doctrinal expansions.
- **Creedal confession:** the communal, liturgical function of the Creed as boundary- and identity-forming for the church.
- **Trinity (functional reading):** doctrine as interpretive framework describing God's self-revelation in Father, Son, Spirit rather than metaphysical ontology.
 - Relation to Filioque: treated as later doctrinal development with historical-political impetus; not central to the Creed's kerygmatic core.
- **Christology (kerygmatic Christology):** Christ presented as the decisive act of God rather than a set of metaphysical attributes detached from proclamation.
- **Resurrection (existential event):** presented as the apical kerygma that demands a faith response; historicity is rearticulated within proclamation.
- **Revelation (dialectical disclosure):** revelation as God's event that confronts human existence; theology's task is interpretive appropriation.
- **Faith (Glaube):** existential stance induced by proclamation, not mere intellectual assent.
- **Doctrinal development:** historical growth and modification of creedal language; to be analyzed historically and read existentially.
- **Ecumenical Creeds:** as shared liturgical texts that function ecumenically by centering proclamation while allowing historical variations.
- **Filioque:** exemplifies a western doctrinal insertion; Bultmann's approach treats it as historically conditioned and secondary to the Creed's salvific message.
- **Hermeneutical precedence:** method that prioritizes existential meaning over metaphysical systematization.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **hermeneutical model** for reading creeds in preaching, pastoral theology, and homiletics (kerygma-first approach).
- As a **polemic** against metaphysical and purely systematic treatments of creedal statements (useful in methodological debates).
- As an **exegetical resource** for creed-history and for teaching the function of creeds in confessional and ecumenical contexts.
