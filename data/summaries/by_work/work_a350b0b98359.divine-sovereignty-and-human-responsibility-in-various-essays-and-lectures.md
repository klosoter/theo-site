### TITLE
Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility - John M. Frame (essays and lectures)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed context; Frame taught at Westminster Theological Seminary and Reformed Theological Seminary. Work responds to contemporaneous debates (Molinism, Open Theism, secular challenges about providence and theodicy).
 - Audience: advanced seminarians, pastors, and theologians seeking a Reformed defense of sovereignty compatible with real human responsibility.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God is absolutely sovereign (comprehensive ordainer and sustainer) while creatures are genuinely responsible agents. The alleged contradiction between exhaustive divine foreknowledge/decree and human moral accountability is resolvable within a classical Reformed compatibilist framework.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirm biblical-theological primacy: Scripture frames the categories of sovereignty and responsibility; philosophical categories must serve biblical exegesis.
 - Distinguish kinds of divine action and will (active decree, permissive will, providential concurrence) to account for how God brings about ends through responsible agents.
 - Rejects libertarian accounts of freedom (e.g., Open Theism and some Arminian positions) as unnecessary and exegetically weak; also critiques Molinism (middle knowledge) as philosophically and theologically inferior to a doctrine of divine decree and concurrence.
 - Offers a theodical account: God permits and ordains evil in the providential ordering of history toward greater redemptive goods, without making God the moral author of sin.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture and Reformed confessional tradition (implicit appeals to Calvin, Westminster standards).
 - Engages contemporary philosophers and theologians: critics from Open Theism, proponents of Molinism (Luis de Molina type arguments), and modern defenders of libertarian freedom (e.g., some analytic philosophers of religion).
 - Interaction with classical theists (Aquinas, Augustine) and modern defenders of compatibilism (e.g., Plantinga).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine foreknowledge, decree, predestination, human freedom and responsibility, sin and theodicy; methodological remarks about biblical authority and theological method.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on a robust, Scripture-grounded Reformed compatibilism: God's exhaustive sovereign will and foreknowledge govern history without annulling genuine moral responsibility, and this coherence is central to sound pastoral and apologetic responses to evil.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Integrates a multiperspectival theological method with classical Reformed confessional commitments: theological categories are evaluated by Scripture, church doctrine, and philosophical clarity without capitulating to libertarian intuitions.
 - Emphasizes the distinction and relation between God's ordaining will and permissive will as hermeneutical keys for providence passages.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with Molinism: rejects middle knowledge as an unnecessary philosophical patch; insists divine decree and concurrence suffice to explain providence.
 - Contrasts with Open Theism: denies that divine knowledge or control requires temporal limitation; defends God's exhaustive foreknowledge as compatible with creaturely responsibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear operationalization of "concurrence" and layered descriptions of God's willing (decretive vs permissive) for theological pedagogy.
 - Uses covenantal lordship language to root sovereignty in relational, covenantal purposes rather than abstract metaphysical control.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary classrooms as a concise, pastoral-oriented defense of compatibilist providence; frequently cited in polemics against Open Theism and Molinism.
 - Praised for clarity and pastoral sensitivity; critiqued by libertarian proponents for downplaying intuitions of alternate possibilities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model of combining biblical exegesis, systematic coherence, and pastoral theodicy; remains a go-to compact resource for defending classical Reformed answers to foreknowledge and the problem of evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's comprehensive decree and governance over all events; not merely priority of will but causal ordination.
- **Human responsibility** - Real moral accountability grounded in creaturely agency even when actions are within God's providential plan.
- **Compatibilism** - The view upheld: freedom compatible with causal determinism when actions flow from the agent's desires and nature.
- **Providence** - God's ongoing care, concurrence, and direction of created causes toward ordained ends.
 - concurrency - God's immediate causal cooperation with creaturely actions without making God the moral agent of sin.
- **Foreknowledge** - God's exhaustive, non-temporal knowledge of future free acts; knowledge does not diminish responsibility.
- **Decree (decretive will)** - God's definite ordaining of ends and the means by which they occur.
- **Permissive will** - God's allowing of creaturely choices, including sin, within the framework of providential ordering.
- **Middle knowledge** - Molinist concept criticized here as unnecessary and theologically problematic.
- **Libertarian freedom** - The freedom Frame rejects as required by some; he argues it is neither biblically mandated nor philosophically needed.
- **Theodicy** - Defense of God's goodness in permitting/ordering evil toward greater goods; framed biblically rather than speculative philosophically.
- **Covenantal lordship** - Sovereignty described in covenantal terms: God rules in relationship to his promises and redemptive plan.
- **Moral government** - God's governance that sustains moral responsibility and justice while executing sovereign purposes.
- **Biblical-method priority** - Hermeneutical principle that Scripture governs theological categories and philosophical aids are subsidiary.
- **Sovereign concurrence** - Practical term used to explain how God providentially uses secondary causes without authoring sin.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for Reformed compatibilist accounts of providence and foreknowledge.
 - As polemic material against Molinism and Open Theism in systematic and philosophical theology.
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for addressing the problem of evil and teaching providence in preaching and pastoral care.
