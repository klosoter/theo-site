### TITLE
Covenant Theology - Anthony Hoekema (Encyclopedia of Christianity)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed scholarship; Hoekema (Calvin Seminary professor) writes as a representative of classical Reformed/federal theology for a general reference work. The entry aims to summarize historical development and doctrinal contours for an ecumenical readership amid ongoing debates with dispensationalism and newer covenant proposals.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Covenant theology is presented as the organizing paradigm of redemptive history: God governs salvation-history by covenants. The primary doctrinal problem treated is how divine promises and demands across Scripture cohere - especially the relation between the pre‑Fall promise to Adam (the **Covenant of Works**) and the post‑Fall promise of salvation in Christ (the **Covenant of Grace**).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical sketch: roots in Augustine, developed in Reformation (Calvin), systematized by Reformed scholastics and Westminster divines.
 - Basic schema: two principal covenants (Works and Grace), with various sub‑administrations (e.g., Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) as manifestations of one saving purpose.
 - Theological implications: covenantal structure explains election, Christ's mediatorship, sacraments as signs/seals, corporate nature of sin and salvation (federal headship).
 - Polemical contrast: covenant theology contrasted with dispensationalism (radical discontinuity, separate peoples of God) and with some modern revisions that deny a formal Covenant of Works.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and the Reformation, Westminster Confession and Puritan writers, later Reformed systematicians; opponents noted include classical dispensationalists and various modern critics who either collapse or over‑emphasize discontinuity (e.g., some forms of NCT).
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, covenant (as central), creation and fall, Christology (mediatorial role), soteriology (justification, union with Christ), ecclesiology (covenant community), sacraments (signs and seals), law and gospel, election and federal headship.
- **Closing line:** Covenant theology, as articulated by Hoekema, centers redemptive history on a single gracious purpose realized through a covenantal economy culminating in Christ the mediator - with the Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace as the linchpin distinction for biblical coherence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear articulation of the **Covenant of Works** as a pre‑Fall legal relation between God and Adam (life for perfect obedience) and the Covenant of Grace as the unilateral gracious arrangement after the fall fulfilled in Christ.
 - Strong stress on the **unity of the covenantal economy**: diverse biblical covenants are administrations of one saving plan rather than wholly separate dispensations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects dispensational fragmentation by insisting on substantial continuity between Israel and the church (corporate identity under one covenantal promise).
 - Pushes back against those who minimize the Covenant of Works by defending its explanatory power for federal headship and the law/gospel distinction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not an innovator of new terminology, but notable for concise, pedagogical clarification of classic federal categories for a broad audience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Used widely in Reformed teaching and popular introductions to covenant theology; functions as a reliable, conservative encyclopedia summary.
 - Influential as a clear statement against dispensational readings and as a resource for seminarians and pastors needing a compact presentation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Concise, orthodox synthesis of federal theology useful as a starting point for more detailed study.
 - Especially valuable when surveying the doctrinal role of the Covenant of Works within systematic and pastoral concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** Pre‑fall covenant with Adam promising life for perfect obedience; explains federal headship and original probation.
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's post‑fall covenantal promise of redemption accomplished in Christ; unilateral and gracious in character.
- **Federal theology (federalism):** The framework that conceives of Adam and Christ as covenantal heads representing their respective communities.
- **Administrations of the covenant:** Various historical forms (Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) seen as diverse expressions of one covenantal plan.
- **Mediator (Christ as mediator):** Central role of Christ who fulfills the covenantal demands and secures the promises for believers.
- **Signs and seals (sacraments):** Baptism and Lord's Supper as covenantal signs that confirm and seal the promises to the covenant community.
- **Law and gospel distinction:** Law as covenantal demand (echoes Covenant of Works); gospel as covenantal promise now fulfilled in Christ.
- **Election:** Covenantal grounding for divine choice; corporate and particular in classical Reformed exposition.
- **Union with Christ:** Soteriological key to how covenant promises apply to believers as members of Christ's body.
- **Continuity vs. discontinuity:** Hoekema favors continuity - covenants are coherent stages of one plan, not wholly separate economies.
- **Typology:** Old Testament persons and institutions foreshadow covenantal realities fulfilled in Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for basic federal categories (esp. Covenant of Works) in teaching and reference.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dispensational separations and against views that deny a meaningful Covenant of Works.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical covenants as unified administrations of redemption.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed curricula when moving from biblical theology to systematic treatments of soteriology and sacraments.
