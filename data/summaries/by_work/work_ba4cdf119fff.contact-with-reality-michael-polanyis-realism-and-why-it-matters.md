### TITLE
Contact with Reality: Michael Polanyi's Realism and Why It Matters - Esther R. Meek

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century philosophical theology (Meek published this in the 2000s). Engages the revival of interest in Michael Polanyi (mid-20th century chemist-philosopher) and reacts to late modern epistemic fragmentation: scientism, foundationalism, radical skepticism, and some postmodern anti-realism.
 - Meek writes from a broadly Christian, reformationally sympathetic perspective that seeks an epistemology congenial to theological knowledge and to ordinary human knowing.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Knowledge is essentially **contact with reality**: a personal, fiduciary, tacitly mediated relation between knower and the real, not the mere processing of propositions or the accumulation of neutral data.
 - Theological problem addressed: how Christian claims (revelation, Scripture, knowledge of God) can be epistemically responsible without succumbing to positivism, fideism, or relativistic anti-realism.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Explicates key Polanyian moves: tacit knowing, indwelling, personal commitment, and the hierarchy of knowing.
 - Argues for a realist epistemology rooted in **contact** - that reality imposes constraints on belief and inquiry through success and failure of indwelling.
 - Shows how tacit skills and personal commitment ground explicit beliefs; propositional articulation depends on, and is accountable to, the tacit contact with reality.
 - Applies this epistemology to theological loci: revelation is an occasion of contact; Scripture mediates. Christian knowing is practiced within communities and apprenticeships that form tacit skills of recognition and responsibility.
 - Concludes with implications: epistemic virtue (responsibility, intellectual honesty) and institutional practices (education, worship, discipleship) are essential to preserving contact with reality.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Michael Polanyi (primary), especially Personal Knowledge and The Tacit Dimension.
 - Indirect engagement with analytic epistemology (foundationalism, coherentism), scientism, and postmodern skepticism.
 - Theological interlocutors: general Christian epistemology debates (fideism vs. evidentialism), with affinities to Reformed emphases on covenantal formation though not narrowly sectarian.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and epistemology of faith (how God is known and how Scripture functions).
 - Authority and tradition (epistemic role of community and practices).
 - Implicitly bears on Christology (Christ as the ultimate point of contact/reality to which theology is accountable) and ecclesiology (formation of knowers), though not a systematic doctrinal treatise.

- **Closing line**
 - Theology and Christian practice should recover a **Polanyan contact realism**: knowing God and Scripture occurs by responsible, tacitly skilled persons in community - a realism that safeguards both fidelity to truth and the personal, formative character of faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **tacit knowing** and skillful indwelling as epistemic foundations rather than abstract evidential rules.
 - Treats epistemology as a practical, moral, and communal discipline: knowing is a way of being formed, not merely a relation to propositions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects both scientistic reductionism (knowledge = measurable data or algorithm) and relativistic fideism (faith as mere subjectivity) by insisting reality constrains and informs belief through successful contact.
 - Offers an alternative to strict foundationalism: justified belief emerges from practiced contact rather than from indubitable propositional foundations.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Polanyi's technical vocabulary (indwelling, tacit dimension, fiduciary commitment) as a systematic tool for theological epistemology - "contact epistemology" as a usable label.
 - Emphasizes **responsibility** as an epistemic virtue - the knower's accountability to what is known.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Gained traction among theologians and philosophers concerned with embodied, personalist epistemologies; influential in conversations about religious epistemology, hermeneutics, and pedagogy.
 - Used by some within Reformed and evangelical circles to defend non-fideistic but non-reductive accounts of Scripture and faith.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a practical, formation-oriented epistemology useful for preaching, teaching, and apologetics.
 - Offers a bridge between analytic epistemology and theological practice, making Polanyi accessible to theological students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Contact with reality** - The central epistemic model: knowing as relational contact, not mere representation.
- **Tacit knowledge** - Non-propositional skills, know-how, and subsidiary awareness that make explicit knowledge possible.
- **Indwelling** - The process by which a knower tacitly inhabits tools, texts, practices, or traditions to apprehend a focal reality.
- **Personal knowledge** - Polanyi/Meek notion that all knowing involves personal commitment and passion; objectivity is personal and responsible.
- **Fiduciary commitment** - Trust-oriented posture toward reality; epistemic commitments that orient inquiry.
- **Responsibility (epistemic virtue)** - The knower's duty to submit beliefs to reality and to communal correction.
- **Rooted realism** - Realism grounded in person-to-world contact rather than in neutral observational foundations.
- **Tacit/explicit relation** - The dynamic where tacit skill undergirds and validates explicit propositions.
- **Apprenticeship / formation** - Epistemic learning as participation in practices that cultivate tacit competencies.
- **Mediation (Scripture, tradition)** - How texts and communities mediate contact with divine and created realities.
- **Anti-reductionism** - Rejection of reducing knowledge to sensory data or algorithmic rules.
- **Communal accountability** - Knowledge assessed within communities of practice, not solely by individual introspection.
- **Epistemic humility** - Openness to correction stemming from the nature of contact.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** for theological epistemology opposing fideism and scientism simultaneously.
- As a **definition source** for tacit, personal, and practice-centered knowing in courses on epistemology of religion.
- As a **pedagogical model** for formation-focused approaches to doctrine, preaching, and spiritual formation.
