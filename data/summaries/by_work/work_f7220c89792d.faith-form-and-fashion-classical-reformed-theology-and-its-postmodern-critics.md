### TITLE
Faith, Form, and Fashion: Classical Reformed Theology and Its Postmodern Critics - Paul Helm

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century engagement: a Reformed, confessional response to postmodern critiques of doctrinal theology; Helm writes as an analytic-minded orthodox theologian addressing trends in continental/postmodern theology that relativize doctrine and propositional truth.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Helm defends the legitimacy and necessity of **classical Reformed doctrinal forms** (confessions, propositional theology, systematic coherence) against postmodern charges that such forms are oppressive, mere "fashion," or epistemologically untenable.
 - Linked doctrinal cluster: the treatment of **divine foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil** is a test-case for whether classical theism can sustain intellectual and pastoral credibility in a postmodern age.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Stage 1: Expose common postmodern criticisms (anti-foundationalism, suspicion of meta-narratives, privileging of narrative/experience over doctrine).
 - Stage 2: Re-articulate the classical Reformed commitments - propositional revelation, confessional continuity, divine sovereignty - with analytic rigor.
 - Stage 3: Apply this framework to specific theological loci (notably God's foreknowledge and providence) to show internal coherence and pastoral adequacy.
 - Argues that a robust doctrine of divine foreknowledge and determinative providence need not collapse moral responsibility or moral intelligibility.
 - Treats the problem of evil by insisting on metaphysical resources in classical theism (sovereignty, God's aseity, justice and goodness) rather than retreat to relativism or agnosticism.
 - Stage 4: Critique of postmodern alternatives (open theism, process thought, purely narrative theology) as inadequate either philosophically or theologically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with postmodern theorists and theologians (Wittgenstein-influenced Wittgensteinians, narrative theologians) and with analytic philosophers of religion. Implicates debates with open-theism proponents and process theologians without making them sole targets.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (propositional vs. narrative), authority of confessions, divine attributes (omniscience, sovereignty), providence, human freedom and responsibility, theodicy/problem of evil, ecclesial form and doctrinal stability.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Helm's work insists that **faith properly formed by doctrinal truth** remains the necessary and defensible posture against postmodern skepticism: classical Reformed theology is not an obsolete fashion but the best available structure for coherent theism and pastoral faithfulness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Marries a confessional, historical-Reformed posture with analytic clarity - not simply historical apology nor mere philosophical abstraction.
 - Prioritizes **doctrinal form** (the pattern and shape of belief) as constitutive for faithful Christian cognition and practice.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on postmodern theology's suspicion of propositions and doctrines by showing how anti-propositionalism undermines accountability, communal teaching, and coherent theodicy.
 - Contrasts classical theistic accounts of providence and foreknowledge with open-theist/process alternatives, defending divine eternity and exhaustive foreknowledge as compatible with meaningful human responsibility.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Recasts "faith" as disciplined assent within a confessional form rather than merely private piety or narrative belonging.
 - Employs analytic distinctions (compatibilist freedom, modalities of knowledge) to clarify classical Reformed claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for resisting fashionable theological fads; used in curricula defending confessional orthodoxy.
 - Cited by those bridging analytic philosophy of religion and systematic theology; less persuasive to postmodern or liberation theologians.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise model for defending doctrinal integrity in pluralist intellectual contexts and for teaching how classical doctrines address contemporary philosophical objections.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical Reformed theology** - confessional, covenantal system emphasizing God's sovereignty and scriptural propositional revelation.
- **Postmodern critics** - umbrella term for anti-foundationalist, narrative-focused, or Wittgenstein-influenced theologians who question propositional doctrine.
- **Faith as assent** - faith conceived as doctrinally-formed intellectual assent, not merely existential commitment.
- **Form (doctrinal form)** - the structured set of beliefs and confessions that shape Christian cognition and practice.
- **Fashion (theological fashion)** - transient theological trends; Helm distinguishes genuine development from mere novelty.
- **Divine foreknowledge** - God's exhaustive knowledge of future contingents; Helm argues for compatibility with responsibility.
 - Contrast: open theism (limited foreknowledge) and simple foreknowledge defended within classical theism.
- **Providence** - God's sovereign governance of creation; central to Helm's response to the problem of evil.
- **Problem of evil** - Helm uses classical theistic resources (sovereignty, eschatological hope, moral responsibility) to resist reductive skeptical responses.
- **Compatibilism** - the doctrine that human freedom and divine determinative providence can coexist; Helm leans on this framework in discussing responsibility.
- **Propositional revelation** - the view that Scripture communicates truths that can be assented to; emphasized against anti-propositional trends.
- **Confessionalism** - reliance on historic creeds and confessions as formative for doctrine and communal identity.
- **Analytic theology** - use of conceptual clarity and philosophical argumentation to articulate and defend doctrinal claims.
- **Anti-foundationalism** - the postmodern denial of stable epistemic foundations; Helm critiques its theological consequences.
- **Narrative vs. propositional** - Helm argues for a balance: narrative is important, but cannot replace propositional truth where doctrine and theodicy are concerned.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for what counts as classical Reformed doctrinal form and why it matters.
- As a **polemic** against postmodern, open-theist, and process critiques of classic theism, especially regarding foreknowledge, providence, and theodicy.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading doctrinal loci through confessional categories informed by analytic precision.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses bridging analytic philosophy of religion and confessional systematic theology.
