### TITLE
Brief Outline of the Study of Theology - Friedrich Schleiermacher 
Early 19th-century German Protestant theology; situated at the intersection of Enlightenment critique, Romanticism, and the emerging Wissenschaft der Theologie.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Post-Enlightenment Germany (turn of 19th century); theological training under pressure from rationalist philosophy, historical criticism, and calls for reform in clerical education.
 - Schleiermacher mediates Kantian epistemological concerns and Romantic emphasis on experience; aims to reconfigure theology as a disciplined science rooted in Christian consciousness.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be re-founded methodologically: it is a systematic, historical, and practical study grounded not primarily in metaphysical proof but in the distinctively Christian religious consciousness (the feeling of absolute dependence) and the historical revelation of Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theology is a multi-faceted Wissenschaft with correlated tasks:
 - Descriptive/Analytic: clarify the phenomenon of religion and the Christian consciousness.
 - Exegetical/Historical: situate Scripture and doctrines within their historical development.
 - Systematic/Dogmatic: construct coherent, critical presentations of Christian doctrine informed by experience and history.
 - Practical/Didactic: apply doctrinal conclusions to piety, pastoral theology, and church life.
 - Methodological moves:
 - Prioritize religious experience (Gefühl) as normative datum for theology.
 - Employ historical-critical tools to discern development and meaning in Scripture and tradition.
 - Treat dogma as an interpretive articulation of Christian self-understanding, open to revision under critical scrutiny.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian epistemology, Herderian historicism, contemporary rationalists and orthodox confessionalists; draws on Scripture, patristic and confessional materials, and modern philosophy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinitarian theology, Christology (incarnation, Sonship), pneumatology (Spirit in revelation and resurrection), anthropology (origin and nature of sin), ecclesiology and sacraments (baptism, marks of the church), and doctrinal issues such as traducianism vs creationism.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher reframes theology as a critical, historically informed science whose center of gravity is the Christian consciousness and the Spirit-mediated, historically-located revelation of God in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology anchored in *religious feeling* (absolute dependence) rather than metaphysical proofs or creedal fiat.
 - Integration of historical-critical method with pastoral and doctrinal aims; dogma is descriptive of religious consciousness, not merely propositional assertion.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Enlightenment deism/rationalism by reasserting religion as irreducible experience; challenges confessional orthodoxy by relocating authority from static creeds to dynamic historical and experiential appropriation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Moves theology toward a Wissenschaft model that treats doctrines as evolving articulations; promotes a hermeneutic of correlation between experience and historical witness.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on modern liberal Protestant theology, historical theology, and theological education; praised for method and breadth, criticized by conservative theologians for subjectivizing revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a coherent program for curricular reform in seminaries: rigorous philology/exegesis, historical consciousness, systematic reflection, and pastoral formation grounded in experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious feeling / feeling of absolute dependence**
 - Normative starting-point for theology; the irreducible experiential datum that theology must explicate.
- **Christian consciousness**
 - The specific form of religious feeling shaped by the historical revelation in Christ; basis for dogmatic formulation.
- **Wissenschaft der Theologie (theology as science)**
 - Theology treated as disciplined, critical, and systematic inquiry; includes history, exegetics, dogmatics, and practical theology.
- **Historical-critical method**
 - Use of history to locate Scripture and dogma; doctrines understood as historically situated articulations.
- **Dogmatics**
 - Systematic construction of Christian truth-claims grounded in Christian consciousness and historical testimony.
- **Practical theology / pastoral application**
 - Emphasis on formation of piety and ecclesial life; doctrinal claims tested by ecclesial and spiritual fruitfulness.
- **Revelation as Spirit-mediated**
 - Revelation is experienced in religious consciousness and mediated historically in Christ and the church by the Spirit; informs pneumatological emphases (Spirit in incarnation and resurrection).
- **Ecclesiology & sacraments**
 - Church seen as living community of Christian consciousness; sacraments understood functionally within communal religious life (e.g., baptism's efficacy tied to Christian experience and ecclesial context).
- **Traducianism vs Creationism**
 - Treated as question about anthropology and origin of the soul; situated within a methodological framework that weighs scriptural, traditional, and experiential data.
- **Sin (nature & origin)**
 - Interpreted in relation to human dependence and estrangement from God; doctrinal answers linked back to experience and biblical-historical testimony.
- **Key hermeneutical posture**
 - Correlation: theology must correlate human religious experience with the historical message of Scripture and tradition.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological blueprint** for organizing theological curricula and research (definition of loci and tasks).
 - As a **polemic** against both rationalist reductionism and dogmatic authoritarianism-used to argue for experience-informed, historically critical theology.
 - As an **exegetical-model** that legitimates historical criticism and experiential hermeneutics in contested doctrinal debates (e.g., pneumatology, sacramental efficacy).
