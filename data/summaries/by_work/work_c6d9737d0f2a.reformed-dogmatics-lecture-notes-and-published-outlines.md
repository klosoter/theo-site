### TITLE
Reformed Dogmatics (lecture notes and published outlines) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Westminster milieu; Van Til (1895-1987) taught systematic theology and apologetics at Westminster Theological Seminary. These notes synthesize classroom lectures, outlines and later published lecture collections shaped by the Reformed covenantal tradition and by Van Til's presuppositional apologetics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian dogmatics must begin with the self-revealing Triune God as the unavoidable presupposition for all thought. Theology organizes biblical revelation historically (historia salutis) within the covenantal economy; the Holy Spirit is the living agent who unites revelation, redemption, and believer.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Start with the doctrine of God as infinite personal being and the Trinitarian relations that ground covenantal action.
 - Affirm Scripture as the propositional vehicle of revelation, authenticated and applied by the Spirit.
 - Place Christ centrally: eternal Sonship and incarnation as the eternal covenantal foundation for redemption.
 - Develop soteriology in redemptive-historical (historia salutis) categories rather than abstract logical sequences (ordo salutis).
 - Treat pneumatology as intrinsically bound to Christ's mediatorial work (Spirit in Christ's ministry, resurrection, and appropriation of salvation).
 - Address ecclesiology and sacraments (baptism, Spirit-baptism) as covenantal signs and means of grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed scholastic and neo-Calvinist sources (e.g., early Reformed confessions, Kuyper, Bavinck) and contemporary interlocutors in evangelicalism and neo-orthodoxy (Barth, evidentialist apologists).
 - Van Til's own interlocutors include proponents of evidential apologetics and varying positions on the Spirit's gifts (continuationists and cessationists).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, Christology (eternal Sonship, incarnation), Pneumatology (Spirit's role in redemption and ministry), Covenant theology (covenant of redemption), Soteriology (historia salutis vs ordo salutis), Eschatology (parousia and its delay), Sacramental theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til's dogmatics insists theology is a Trinitarian, covenantal, Spirit-empowered reading of redemptive history in which revelation itself supplies the presuppositions for coherent Christian thought.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Rigorous presuppositional method: theological starting-point is God's self-revelation; unbelieving thought is ultimately inconsistent.
 - Antithesis and total worldview contrast: theology contests rival worldviews at the foundational level rather than only on evidential grounds.
 - Priority of historia salutis: doctrinal loci are treated within the unfolding of redemption rather than as isolated logical sequences.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Opposes evidentialist apologetics that treat reason as neutral; rejects a privatized, existential neo-orthodoxy detached from propositional revelation.
 - Reframes debates (e.g., continuationism vs cessationism) to hinge on covenantal, biblical-historical criteria rather than mainly experiential or pragmatic arguments.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Integration of presuppositional apologetics into systematic dogmatics; treating the covenant of redemption as an intra-Trinitarian plan with ontological weight.
 - Emphasis on the Spirit as the epistemic agent who makes revelation efficacious in history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among presuppositionalists (Bahnsen, Frame), and formative for Reformed apologetics and covenantal theology; sometimes criticized by evangelicals who favor evidentialist methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined, covenant-historical theology that foregrounds the Spirit's role in revelation and the centrality of Christ; valuable for integrating apologetics and systematic theology in Reformed teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Theology begins with God's self-revelation; unbelieving reason is critiqued at its presuppositions.
- **Antithesis**
 - Fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought-worlds; affects all loci.
- **Historia salutis**
 - Redemptive history as primary framework for articulating doctrine; events precede abstract order.
- **Ordo salutis**
 - Logical/sequential ordering of soteriological doctrines; Van Til subordinates this to historia salutis.
- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - Intra-Trinitarian covenant establishing Christ's mediatorial work as eternal and foundational for soteriology.
- **Eternal Sonship & Incarnation**
 - Sonship as eternal relation; incarnation as covenantal historical realization-grounds Christology and the Spirit's mission.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit in redemptive history)**
 - Spirit as agent of revelation, unifier of Word and sacraments, operative in Christ's ministry, resurrection, and the believer's appropriation of grace.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Treated as covenantal incorporation into Christ and the church; theological meaning prioritized over speculative charismatic schemas.
- **Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Van Til frames the dispute around covenantal and scriptural criteria; theological method, not mere experience, decides normative claims.
- **Delay of the Parousia**
 - Theologically approached as a covenantal-historical problem tied to the church's mission and the unfolding of God's redemptive timetable.
- **Revelation (Scripture and Spirit)**
 - Scripture is propositional content; Spirit is the internal and external agent making Scripture authoritative and effective.
- **Analogy of Faith / Organicism**
 - Doctrines interpret doctrines within the whole; dogmatics reads parts in light of the covenantal whole.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for presuppositional method and covenantal readings of Christ and Spirit.
- As a **polemic model** against evidentialist apologetics and reductionist pneumatologies.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual pivot** to recast soteriology, pneumatology, and Christology within historia salutis rather than abstract ordo formulations.
