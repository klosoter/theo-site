### TITLE
"The Image of God in the Garden of Eden: The Creation of Humankind in Genesis 2:5-3:24 in Light of the Mis pi Pit pi and Wpt-r Rituals of Mesopotamia and Ancient Egypt" (2015) - Catherine L. McDowell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2015 amid sustained interest in ANE comparative studies, ritual criticism, and renewed debate over the meaning of the imago Dei (functional vs. substantive models).
 - Engages interdisciplinary scholarship: biblical studies, Assyriology, Egyptology, and ritual theory.

- **Central thesis**
 - Genesis 2:5-3:24 presents the creation and commissioning of humans in Eden as a ritualized inauguration analogous to Mesopotamian mis pi / pit pi purification rites and the Egyptian wpt-r ("opening of the mouth") ritual; the imago Dei is importantly a cultic/functional investiture effected by divine creative rites.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close reading of Genesis 2:5-3:24 emphasizing ritual motifs: formation (yatsar), divine breathing (naphach), planting and placing in a sanctuary-like garden, duties to till and guard (abad, shamar), clothing, and expulsion.
 - Comparative analysis:
 - Mesopotamian mis pi and pit pi: purification, mouth/face rites for contamination and identity restoration.
 - Egyptian wpt-r: ritual opening of mouth to restore agency, speech, and life functions for statues and humans.
 - Synthesis: divine acts in Genesis function as investiture rites that confer cultic agency; the breath and forming correspond to ritual techniques that create a functional personhood in the divine presence.
 - The fall is treated as loss of cultic status and access rather than merely ontological damage.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary interpreters of imago Dei and creation (e.g., John H. Walton), classical ANE scholars (Assyriologists / Egyptologists), and ritual theory (ritualists and comparative religionists).
 - Draws on primary ritual texts and philological parallels from Akkadian and Egyptian corpora and standard Genesis exegesis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, anthropology (imago Dei), priesthood/cultic function of humans, sin and alienation, sacred space (Eden as sanctuary/temple).

- **Closing line**
 - McDowell centers theologically on **the imago Dei as ritual-cultic appointment**: human life in Eden is constituted by divine rites that enact and authorize human service in God's presence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes *ritual form* of Genesis creation narratives over purely metaphysical or sociological readings.
 - Frames imago Dei primarily as **functional/cultic identity** (investiture into divine service) rooted in observed ANE ritual practices.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Refines Walton-style functional readings by supplying concrete ritual analogues rather than abstract "function" alone.
 - Challenges purely ontological or image-as-property accounts by showing how ancient rites instantiate personhood and agency.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Explicitly links Mesopotamian mis pi / pit pi and Egyptian wpt-r to Hebrew narrative motifs (breathing, forming, mouth/opening, purification, clothing, temple-care).
 - Treats Eden as a micro-temple where creation/commissioning rites occur.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable within ANE-informed biblical scholarship and theological anthropology debates; cited by scholars exploring cultic readings of Genesis and temple/temporal models of Eden.
 - Less influential in conservative systematic traditions that favor substance-based imago accounts, but increasingly used in interdisciplinary classrooms.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a replicable methodological model: philological attention + ritual parallelism to reframe theological concepts.
 - Useful corrective to readings that isolate imago Dei from cultic and spatial contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mis pi** - Mesopotamian "washing of the mouth/face" purification rite; McDowell uses it as a parallel to Hebrew motifs of cleansing and initiation.
- **Pit pi** - Complementary Mesopotamian rite (exorcistic/purificatory); parallels Genesis motifs of contamination, protection, and ritual boundary.
- **Wpt-r (wpet-r)** - Egyptian "opening of the mouth" ritual restoring sensory/communicative life and agency; used to illuminate the breath/mouth motifs in Genesis.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - Recast as **ritual-cultic investiture** conferring delegated authority and priestly function, not merely intrinsic substance.
- **Yatsar (formed)** - Hebrew verb for formation; read as ritual shaping akin to artisan-ritual creation, not only biological molding.
- **Naphach / breathe (divine breath)** - The breathal act is read as a ritual animating/investing impulse comparable to opening-mouth rites.
- **Nephesh (living being / soul)** - Treated in relation to ritual status: life-as-ritual-enabled presence in the divine sanctuary.
- **Abad / Shamar (to serve / to guard)** - Command verbs that indicate cultic roles (service and preservation of sacred space).
- **Eden as temple/sanctuary** - Conceptual frame: the garden functions as sacred space where investiture rites occur.
- **Garments of skin / clothing** - Interpreted as ritual dress or restoration of status after transgression; clothing as social-ritual marker.
- **Expulsion / loss of access** - The fall construed as loss of cultic standing and sanctuary access rather than only existential corruption.
- **Cultic investiture** - Term for the process by which divine actions confer identity and duties.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis through ANE ritual parallels.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological anthropology: supports functional/cultic readings of imago Dei.
- As a **polemic resource** against purely ontological accounts of human dignity by demonstrating ancient ritual emphases.
