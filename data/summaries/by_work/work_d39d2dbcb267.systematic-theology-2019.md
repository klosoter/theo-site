### TITLE
Systematic Theology (2019) - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** 2019 Reformed-catholic retrieval; post-ESS debates on the Trinity; renewed classical theism; ecumenical ressourcement from the Fathers; engagement with analytic and post-Barthian currents.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** A biblically saturated, confessionally Reformed, and patristically informed account of Christian doctrine, integrating the whole economy under the primacy of the Triune God, with **union with Christ by the Spirit** as a soteriological center of gravity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - **Prolegomena:** Scripture, authority, catholic creeds, method; theology as contemplation and proclamation.
 - **God and the Trinity:** Simplicity, immutability, eternity; **eternal generation** and **processions-missions**; **inseparable operations**; careful **ontological vs economic** distinction.
 - **Creation and providence:** Image of God, Sabbath, sovereignty, concursus; good creation and fall.
 - **Anthropology and sin:** Adamic headship; **original sin and imputation**; Augustinian over against Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian schemes.
 - **Christology:** One person, two natures; **anhypostasia/enhypostasia**; **impeccability**; virgin conception; states and offices; **active and passive obedience**.
 - **Atonement and salvation:** Penal substitution within a rich mosaic (victory, recapitulation, sacrifice); calling, faith, justification, sanctification; **union with Christ** and **theosis** as participation by grace.
 - **Pneumatology:** Person and work of the Spirit; Spirit as bond of union; gifts and sanctification; ecclesial life.
 - **Church and sacraments:** Means of grace; Word and sacrament; spiritual presence in the Supper; baptismal incorporation.
 - **Last things:** Consummation, resurrection, judgment, new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture read with Nicene and Chalcedonian consensuses; Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine, Cyril; Anselm, Aquinas; Calvin, the Westminster Standards, Turretin; Bavinck; Barth and Torrance; Rahner; constructive engagement with Van Til; critical readings of modern trinitarianism and kenotic Christologies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; Trinity; creation, providence; anthropology; hamartiology; Christology; atonement; soteriology (with union as axis); pneumatology; ecclesiology; sacraments; eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The Triune God acts toward us as He is in Himself, drawing the church by the Spirit into **communion with the incarnate Son**, the pattern and power of all doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - Strong Nicene-Chalcedonian retrieval (eternal generation, inseparable operations).
 - Reformed catholicity that integrates Eastern theosis language with Reformed **union with Christ**.
 - Careful Christological grammar (anhypostasia/enhypostasia) to ground **impeccability** and communicatio idiomatum.
 - Robust hamartiology: **original sin** and **imputation** within federal and realistic solidarity.
- **Corrections / contrasts:** 
 - Pushback on **Van Til's one person** idiom for the Godhead; returns to classical one essence, three persons.
 - Rejects ESS/ERAS and social-tritheist trends; safeguards **ontological vs economic** distinctions.
 - Resists Pelagian and Semi-Pelagian accounts; re-centers Augustinian grace.
 - Affirms penal substitution without reductionism; sets atonement in broader biblical-catholic frame.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves:** 
 - Clarifies relation of **processions and missions**; divine taxis and inseparable operations.
 - Deploys **union with Christ** as ordo salutis fulcrum; duplex gratia (justification and sanctification) in one union.
 - Uses theosis in a Reformed key (participation by the Spirit, not ontological absorption).
- **Reception and influence:** Quickly adopted in Reformed seminaries as a standard text; appreciated for patristic breadth and clarity in Trinity and Christology debates; cited in discussions on **impeccability**, **imputation**, and trinitarian method.
- **Enduring value:** A reliable map of classical Reformed doctrine with catholic depth, exegetically rooted, and pedagogically clear across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal generation:** The Son is eternally from the Father according to person, not essence; grounds eternal Sonship and missions.
- **Processions and missions:** Eternal relations (begetting, spiration) underlie temporal sendings; no division of will or operation.
- **Inseparable operations:** The Trinity acts indivisibly ad extra, with personal appropriations according to the taxis.
- **Ontological vs economic Trinity:** Who God is eternally vs how He acts in redemption; distinct yet mutually informing.
- **Van Til's one person language:** Critiqued as misleading; preferred classical formula: one essence, three hypostases.
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling of the persons; safeguards unity without collapsing persons.
- **Hypostatic union (anhypostasia/enhypostasia):** Christ's human nature has no independent hypostasis, is enhypostasized by the Logos; secures real humanity and personal unity.
- **Impeccability of Christ:** The incarnate Son could not sin in virtue of His person, though He endured real temptation.
- **Original sin and imputation:** Adamic guilt and corruption reckoned to humanity; federal headship with existential transmission.
 - Contrasts: **Pelagianism** denies original guilt; **Semi-Pelagianism** weakens grace; **Augustinianism** centers sovereign grace.
- **Union with Christ:** Spirit-wrought bond undergirding all saving benefits; duplex gratia as coordinated gifts.
- **Theosis (participation):** Participation in divine life by grace through union with Christ; eschatological consummation.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ fulfills the law and bears the curse; both imputed to believers.
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** The Logos is not circumscribed by the flesh; upholds Creator-creature distinction in the incarnation.
- **Spirit and union:** The Spirit as bond of union, indwelling, sanctifier, and ecclesial life-giver; nexus of Christology and soteriology.
- **How the work is used:**
 - As a definitional source for Trinity (generation, inseparable operations) and Christology (impeccability, anhypostasia/enhypostasia).
 - As a polemical touchstone against ESS, Pelagianism/Semi-Pelagianism, and tritheist social models.
 - As a conceptual pivot: **union with Christ** and Spirit-shaped soteriology integrating justification and sanctification.
 - As an exegetical-patristic model for teaching Reformed doctrine with catholic breadth.
