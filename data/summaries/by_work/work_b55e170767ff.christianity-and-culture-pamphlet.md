### TITLE
Christianity and Culture (pamphlet) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century Reformed/Presbyterian milieu; Van Til writing as a leading proponent of presuppositional apologetics and cultural engagement amid postwar debates about Christian social responsibility and the relation of church and society. Interacts in the shadow of Niebuhr's Christ and Culture debates and Kuyperian neo-Calvinist perspectives.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Culture is not neutral; Christians must interpret, critique, and transform culture from the standpoint of Scripture and the eschatological lordship of Christ. The proper Christian posture presupposes revealed truth and recognizes an antithesis between the Christian worldview and non-Christian worldviews.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Culture arises within the created order but is corrupted by sin; therefore cultural norms have a creational basis yet bear the marks of fallenness.
 - Scripture provides the ultimate presuppositions for interpreting culture; one cannot treat culture as autonomous or derive reliable norms from unaided human reason.
 - The Christian's engagement is twofold: to apply redemptive, creational norms in present cultural structures and to testify to the eschatological consummation that recasts culture under Christ's rule.
 - Antithesis and common grace: van Til allows for common-grace restraining and cultural good, but insists that common grace cannot neutralize the foundational difference between Christian and non-Christian thought.
 - Practical implications: Christian education, institutions, and witness must be explicitly grounded in a biblical worldview rather than in eclectic or "neutral" cultural assumptions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** critical dialogue with H. Richard Niebuhr's typologies of Christ and culture; conversation with Kuyperian neo-Calvinism (agreement on cultural calling, dispute over epistemic neutrality and the role of presuppositions); response to liberal and modernizing tendencies that seek accommodation.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and epistemology (presuppositions), creation (creational norms), fall and common grace, Christology (lordship of Christ), eschatology (consummation and hope), ecclesiology (church's role in cultural witness).
- **Closing line:** Van Til locates the Christian relation to culture squarely in a presuppositional, eschatologically informed antithesis: culture is to be critiqued and reshaped under the Lordship of Christ, not treated as an autonomous standard.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong presuppositional epistemology applied directly to cultural engagement: culture must be read through Scripture's presuppositions rather than treated as an independent source of truth.
 - Eschatological restraint: cultural work is important and real but provisional; ultimate cultural fulfillment awaits Christ's consummation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - To Niebuhr: rejects any model that allows for a neutral synthesis that erases the fundamental antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
 - To softer neo-Calvinism: affirms cultural mandate but insists against epistemic neutrality - Christian institutions must presuppose Scripture rather than merely adopt secular or mixed foundations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Application of presuppositional apologetics vocabulary to cultural theory (e.g., "antithesis" as epistemic and cultural).
 - Tight coupling of common grace with a robust critique: common grace permits cultural good but never dissolves the need for gospel-centered transformation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed circles and apologetic training; shaped how presuppositionalists articulate cultural engagement.
 - Served as a corrective to accommodationist tendencies in mid-20th-century evangelicalism and informed debates over Christian education and institutional formation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the epistemic presuppositions underlying cultural engagement.
 - Provides a concise model for integrating eschatology with social and cultural responsibility without sacrificing doctrinal distinctiveness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism:** the doctrine that Christian faith supplies the necessary starting points for interpreting reality, including culture.
- **Antithesis:** the fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian worldviews that shapes cultural criticism and formation.
- **Common Grace:** God's restraining and enabling grace in providence that explains non-Christian cultural goods but does not erase spiritual antagonism.
 - Relation: permits cooperation and recognition of cultural utility while maintaining theological distinction.
- **Creational norms:** moral and cultural principles grounded in creation that remain intelligible but distorted by sin.
- **Accommodation:** the temptation to adapt Christianity to secular cultural assumptions; criticized as epistemically and theologically dangerous.
- **Eschatological consummation:** the future fulfillment in which culture's ultimate redemption and true order are realized under Christ.
- **Lordship of Christ:** Christ's sovereignty as the governing principle for cultural life and institutions.
- **Neutrality (rejection of):** the thesis that cultural or intellectual positions can be neutral; Van Til rejects this as impossible given presuppositional divides.
- **Cultural transformation:** the task of applying gospel and creational norms to social structures without conflating present provisionality with consummation.
- **Witness and institutional formation:** practical outworkings-churches, schools, and organizations must explicitly ground their identity in Scripture.
- **Epistemic grounding:** the insistence that cultural critique requires a biblical epistemology as the foundation for interpreting facts and values.
- **Critique vs. Collaboration:** distinction between critiquing cultural idols and collaborating where common-grace goods align with Christian ends.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for presuppositional approaches to culture (maps key commitments).
- As a **polemic** against accommodationist and "neutral" models of Christian engagement.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula on Christian worldview, apologetics, and ecclesial cultural practice.
