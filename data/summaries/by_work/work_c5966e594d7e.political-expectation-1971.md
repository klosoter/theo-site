### TITLE
Political Expectation (1971) - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published posthumously (1971) from Tillich's later writings; arises from mid-20th-century Cold War context, secularization debates, and the rise of ideological state claims.
 - Situated in Tillich's existential-ontological theological method and his ongoing engagement with political theology after World War II.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Political life must be judged by a theological standard that resists both the idolatry of political systems and the withdrawal of religion into private piety; genuine political expectation is eschatologically informed realism rather than utopian state-worship or quietism.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Modern politics tends toward absolute expectations (salvation through state or ideology) that become idolatrous.
 - Theological critique: Using the categories of **ultimate concern** and **Ground of Being**, Tillich argues that Christian hope must demythologize political promises without abandoning social engagement.
 - Positive construction: Offers a middle path - a prophetic stance that affirms the legitimate relative authority of political institutions while subverting their claims to ultimacy through the symbol of the Kingdom of God.
 - Practical implications: Church as prophetic sign, ethics of power (restraint and service), and political hope as oriented to justice, not domination.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit dialog with Hegelian state-theory, Marxist promise of historical salvation, secular liberalism, and Christian theological rivals (e.g., Barthian confessionalism).
 - Draws on Tillich's own prior themes: courage to be, correlation method, and existentialist influences (Kierkegaard, Nietzsche) as background.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Political theology, eschatology (kingdom of God as corrective symbol), ecclesiology (church as sign/agent), anthropology (sin and estrangement), ethics (love, power, justice).
 - Less direct treatment of classical dogmatics (Trinity, Christology) - used insofar as they ground hope and incarnation as critique of worldly absolutisms.
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically disciplined political expectation is a prophetic, eschatologically oriented realism that refuses state-idolatry while committing the church to concrete justice and restraint in the use of power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes "expectation" (a theologically shaped hope) rather than mere political program or policy; hope is diagnostic and corrective, not utopian blueprint.
 - Frames political authority as a relative symbolic order that must be critiqued by an ultimate concern that is ontological rather than merely moralistic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects secular political ideologies that promise final salvation through history (Marxism, technocratic progress).
 - Contrasts with both theocratic fusion of church/state and ecclesial withdrawal; Tillich rejects both fusion and flight.
 - Positioned against strict Barthian separatism by retaining engagement grounded in theological anthropology and eschatology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of Tillich's "Ground of Being" and "ultimate concern" language to political expectation, making hope an interpretive category for public theology.
 - Use of "political expectation" as a theological-ethical category distinct from political calculation or mere optimism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Protestant social ethicists and political theologians who sought to avoid both capitulation to secular ideologies and apolitical spirituality.
 - Received critically by confessionalists (Barthians) for perceived ontological abstraction; praised by those integrating existential theology with social critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable framework for assessing political theologies and ideologies; useful for contemporary debates on religion in public life, secularization, and the prophetic role of the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Political expectation** - theological category of hope applied to public life; anticipatory but critical of utopianism.
- **Ultimate concern** - Tillich's central criterion: what a society treats as ultimate determines its idolatry or fidelity.
- **Ground of Being** - metaphysical anchor that prevents political structures from claiming ultimacy; source of true hope.
- **Correlation method** - theologico-philosophical method linking existential questions and Christian answers; used to interpret political malaise.
- **Idolatry of the state** - critique of political absolutism wherein the state becomes salvific.
- **Eschatology (Kingdom of God as symbol)** - corrective symbol that relativizes political achievements while motivating justice.
- **Church as sign and sacrament** - ecclesial role: prophetic witness and foretaste, not political takeover.
- **Love, power, and justice** - ethical matrix: power must be ordered by love and directed toward justice.
- **Secularization and demythologization** - analysis of how modernity both strips and reassigns religious functions to politics.
- **Autonomy vs theonomy (relative/absolute)** - distinction between legitimate self-governance and claims of divine ultimacy by political projects.
- **Prophetic realism** - style of engagement: neither naive optimism nor cynicism.
- **Courage to be (political application)** - existential courage required to resist fear-driven political absolutisms.
- **Symbolic order** - political institutions as meaningful symbols requiring interpretation, not worship.
- **Political theology** - field configured by Tillich's emphasis on ontology and eschatological critique.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a theological notion of political hope and its limits.
 - As a **polemic** against political idolatry and secular messianism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in public theology syllabi to connect ontology, eschatology, and social ethics.
