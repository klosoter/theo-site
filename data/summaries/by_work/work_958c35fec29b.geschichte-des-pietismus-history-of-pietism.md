### TITLE
Geschichte des Pietismus - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th‑century German Protestant milieu; Ritschlian school of liberal Protestant theology reacting to confessional orthodoxy, Schleiermacherian feeling‑theology, and popular revival movements. Work reads as both historical survey and constructive theological critique addressed to contemporary church reform debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Pietism revitalized personal Christian devotion and social charity but, by privatizing religion and privileging inward experience, weakened covenantal ecclesiology and impaired the church's public, ethical role in society.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical narrative: origins in Spenerian practice, institutional expressions (Francke, Moravian movement), diffusion across Lutheran and Reformed territories.
 - Theological analysis: pietism's anthropology (subjective conversion), soteriology (assurance and sanctification), and practical results (missions, philanthropy, sect formation).
 - Ecclesiological critique: shows how pietistic individualism undermines corporate means of grace and Reformation ecclesiology grounded in public Word and sacraments.
 - Church/state implications: traces pietism's ambiguous effects on state churches - reforming moral life but also provoking separatisms that complicate confessional relations with the polity.
 - Constructive proposal: recover a historically rooted, ethically ordered church - the "Kingdom of God" as communal moral reality - integrating genuine piety without forfeiting public ecclesial form.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Philipp Jakob Spener, August Hermann Francke, Count Zinzendorf (Moravian example), Lutheran orthodox writers, contemporary liberal and romantic theologians (implicit engagement with Schleiermacher), state church records and charitable institution reports.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (corporate church, sacraments), anthropology (sin, conversion), soteriology (assurance, sanctification), revelation (historical vs. experiential), and practical theology (missions, charity).
- **Closing line:** Ritschl locates the theological center of gravity in a reconstructed, historically grounded ecclesiology that preserves heartfelt piety while restoring the church's public, ethical office within society.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Frames pietism primarily as an *ethical‑historical* phenomenon rather than merely devotional or pietistic sentimentality.
 - Recasts the church as the embodied "Kingdom of God" defined by shared ethical life and historical revelation, not private inward religion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Against romantic/subjective accounts (Schleiermacher) that valorize feeling as the locus of religion, Ritschl insists on the primacy of corporate, historical faith-judgment.
 - Against confessional orthodoxy that over‑institutionalizes religion, Ritschl acknowledges pietism's corrective but resists its privatizing tendencies.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasis on the "religious value‑judgment" and the church as an ethical community - language that shifts the focus from metaphysical proofs to communal moral realities.
 - Uses pietism as a diagnostic category for modern religious individualism and social reform impulses.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among liberal and social‑ethical theologians who sought a middle path between rigid confessionalism and rampant subjectivism.
 - Criticized by confessionalists and revivalists for underplaying mystical devotion and experiential assurance.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a model for integrating devotional renewal with a robust, public ecclesiology useful in courses on Reformation ecclesiology and church/state relations.
 - Serves as a historically informed critique of privatized religion within modern Protestantism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pietism:** movement originating in 17th‑century Lutheranism stressing personal conversion, Bible study, and moral reform; treated as both corrective and problem for ecclesiology.
- **Spenerianism:** early pietistic program (Spener) emphasizing collegia pietatis and renewal of pastoral practice; example of pietism's formative impulse.
- **Franckean institutions:** social and educational institutions exemplifying pietism's public charitable energy and educational reform.
- **Subjectivism (religious):** pietism's prioritization of inner experience; critiqued for fragmenting communal confession.
- **Ecclesia as ethical community:** Ritschl's preferred ecclesiological category; the church constituted by shared moral life and historical revelation.
- **Religious value‑judgment:** Ritschlian technical phrase for evaluating religious claims by their historical and ethical consequences rather than metaphysical proof.
- **Historical revelation:** the notion that revelation must be apprehended in the church's historical acts and community, opposing purely inward notions of revelation.
- **Private religion vs. public church:** contrast highlighting pietism's inward turn and Ritschl's insistence on a public, civic ecclesial presence.
- **Revivalism and missions:** practical outgrowths of pietism that Ritschl praises for zeal but critiques for ecclesial bypassing.
- **State church / Church‑State relations:** field where pietism both cooperated with state moral reform and provoked tensions via separatist movements (e.g., Moravians).
- **Moravian movement:** case study of pietistic separatism and transnational ecclesial identity challenging state control.
- **Confessionalism:** formal doctrinal identity of churches; Ritschl balances respect for confessions with critique where they become legalistic.
- **Sectarianism:** outcome of extreme privatization; Ritschl warns against fragmentation of Christian witness.
- **Ethical public theology:** term pointing to Ritschl's program of reintegrating personal piety into public moral witness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source and historical sketch** in studies of Reformation Ecclesiology - diagnosing how pietistic currents altered corporate understandings of church.
 - As a **polemic and analytical model** in Church and State Relations - mapping pietism's ambiguous alliance with state moral reform and its propensity for separatism when ecclesial forms fail.
