### TITLE
Calvin on the So-Called Five Points of Calvinism - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed retrieval by John Murray, addressing anachronistic readings that force 17th-century Dortian categories onto 16th-century Calvin.
 - A corrective located within broader debates over the meaning and boundaries of "Calvinism" after Dort, Westminster, and in responses to Arminianism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Murray argues that Calvin's teaching on election, atonement, grace, and perseverance needs to be read on its own terms rather than as an automatic fit with the later five-point schema; nevertheless, Calvin provides robust grounds for doctrines commonly associated with those points, especially as to **regeneration and effectual calling**.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical survey of Calvin's key passages (Institutes, sermons, commentaries) on calling, regeneration, and the application of redemption.
 - Distinction between the *external* (general) call of the Word and sacraments and the *internal/effectual* call of the Spirit that results in regeneration.
 - Emphasis on the monergistic character of regeneration: God as the efficient cause who produces an actual transformation in the soul.
 - Nuanced treatment of atonement: Calvin affirms both the sufficiency of Christ's death and its definite application; Murray nuances the charge that Calvin taught a crude "limited atonement" as later formulated.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: assurance, perseverance, and the place of human responsibility in relation to divine causality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, sermons, commentaries).
 - Comparative/exegetical interlocutors: Augustine (as Calvin's patrimony), later Reformed formulators (Dort, Westminster), and opponents (Arminians).
 - Secondary discussion shaped by mid-20th century Reformed theology and pastoral concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Regeneration, effectual calling, grace (efficacious vs. resistible), election and reprobation, atonement (extent vs. intent), perseverance of the saints, means of grace (Word and sacraments), union with Christ.
- **Closing line**
 - Murray's reading locates Calvin as a staunch advocate of monergistic regeneration and effectual calling while cautioning against imposing post-Calvinist formulations; at root Calvin is a theologian of union with Christ as the ground and context of saving efficacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses Calvin's consistent distinction between the general outward ministry of the Word and a sovereign, inward, Spirit-wrought calling that effectively brings sinners to life.
 - Highlights Calvin's pastoral language about the immediacy and reality of regeneration (not merely forensic justification).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges readings that reduce Calvin to a simple checklist of Dortian points; shows Calvin's terminological and theological flexibility.
 - Counters charges that Calvin taught a mechanistic or arbitrary irresistible grace by demonstrating Calvin's use of relational and covenantal categories alongside divine causality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Murray clarifies and rearticulates the operative distinction: **external call vs. effectual/internal call**, and **sufficiency vs. efficiency** of the atonement in Calvin's idiom.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by mid-century Reformed scholars and pastors to defend classical formulations of election and irresistible grace grounded in Calvin rather than in later synodical jargon.
 - Influential for seminary teaching on how to read Calvin on soteriology and pastoral assurance.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a careful hermeneutic for using Calvin responsibly in doctrinal debates; sharpens how regeneration and calling are taught pastorally and systematically.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regeneration**
 - The Spirit- wrought new birth that transforms the sinner; for Murray this is central to Calvin's soteriology and is monergistic in causation.
- **Effectual Calling (internal call)**
 - A sovereign, efficacious summons by the Spirit that results in conversion; distinguished from the general, external call of the preaching of the Word.
- **External Call**
 - The universal proclamation of the gospel through Word and sacrament that leaves responsibility intact; not sufficient by itself to produce saving faith.
- **Irresistible Grace (efficacious grace)**
 - Calvinian notion that when the Spirit intends to save, the divine operation effectually accomplishes its purpose; Murray stresses nuance-language is relational and moral, not merely mechanical.
- **Unconditional Election**
 - Election grounded in God's sovereign will and good pleasure rather than foreseen faith; Calvin's treatment shows both sovereign choice and pastoral concern.
- **Limited/Particular Redemption**
 - Calvin speaks of Christ's death as accomplished particularly for the elect even while acknowledging universal aspects of sufficiency; Murray argues Calvin's language resists simplistic labeling.
- **Total Depravity / Total Inability**
 - Calvin's anthropology: human inability to effect regeneration; necessitates divine initiation.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central category for application of redemption and the ground of effectual calling and perseverance.
- **Sufficiency vs. Efficiency (of the atonement)**
 - Calvin's distinction: Christ's death is sufficient for many, efficient for the elect.
- **Reprobation**
 - Calvin affirms a doctrine of reprobation that parallels election, taught with pastoral sobriety.
- **Means of Grace (Word & Sacraments)**
 - Instruments through which the external call is offered; the Spirit uses them to effectuate internal calling.
- **Assurance & Perseverance**
 - Pastoral consequences of Calvinian doctrine: assurance rests in God's purpose in election and the sustaining work of the Spirit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for how to read Calvin on regeneration and calling without imposing later categories.
 - As a **polemic resource** against misreadings that equate Calvin rigidly with Dortian formulary language.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for combining textual Calvin studies with systematic concerns about grace, election, and pastoral theology.
