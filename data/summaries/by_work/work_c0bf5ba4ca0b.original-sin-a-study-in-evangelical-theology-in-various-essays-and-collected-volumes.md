### TITLE
Original Sin: A Study in Evangelical Theology - Henri Blocher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical-Reformed conversation; Blocher writes from a French evangelical perspective that interacts with patristic, Reformation, and contemporary Protestant theology. Responds to liberal reductionisms (ethical or existential readings of sin) and to overly abstract systematic accounts that lose biblical nuance.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Blocher defends a multifaceted, biblically-rooted doctrine of original sin that insists original sin is real (not merely exemplarist or mythic) and must be articulated in three interrelated consequences: **guilt, pollution, and death**. He seeks a coherent account of how Adam's fall affects humanity without collapsing into biological determinism or purely forensic imputation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Genesis 3 and Pauline texts (especially Romans 5:12-21): shows biblical witness to solidarity with Adam and the range of consequences described.
 - Distinction of three dimensions:
 - **Guilt** - a real, judicial standing before God (forensic aspect).
 - **Pollution** - a corruption of human nature and moral capacity (moral-ontological aspect).
 - **Death** - both spiritual estrangement and eventual physical mortality (existential and eschatological aspect).
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a corporate/representative model (participation in Adam) that allows for imputation without reducing the matter to mere symbolism or to mechanistic biological transmission.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: original sin explains human need for Christ as second Adam; redemption addresses the triad by forensic justification, moral renewal, and defeat of death in resurrection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and later Augustinian tradition, Calvin and Reformed confessions, Pelagius/Pelagian strains, modern critics (liberal theology), and constructive engagement with Barth and recent evangelicals. Heavy reliance on biblical exegesis of Genesis and Pauline corpus.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology, sin (hamartiology, original sin), covenant and federal headship, Christology (Adam/Christ typology), soteriology (justification, sanctification, resurrection), and eschatology (death and life).
- **Closing line:** Blocher's center of gravity insists original sin must be confessed as a real, multifaceted condition-guilt before God, moral pollution, and the reign of death-remedied only in Christ who reverses Adam's headship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The explicit triadic schema **(guilt - pollution - death)** as a clarifying heuristic for the consequences of Adam's fall.
 - Strong insistence on corporate/representative solidarity while carefully differentiating modes of transmission (no facile biological determinism).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against purely forensic-only readings that reduce original sin to imputation of guilt without recognizing moral corruption.
 - Counters existential-only accounts (sin as mere personal decision or condition) by reinstating creedal/judicial dimensions.
 - Distinguishes his realism from crude Augustinian biological determinism and from Pelagian minimizations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of the guilt/pollution/death triad as a pedagogical and analytic tool to keep together legal, moral, and existential consequences.
 - Nuanced use of "participation" language to mediate between seminal/biological and purely forensic models.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in evangelical and Reformed academic circles for careful exegesis and doctrinal balance.
 - Frequently cited in discussions on imputation vs. inherited corruption and as a corrective to both liberal and mechanistic accounts.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a disciplined, teachable framework that connects biblical texts to systematic loci and pastoral concerns.
 - Useful in seminaries for bridging exegesis and doctrine while avoiding simple polarizations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin** - the doctrine that Adam's fall negatively affects all humanity; Blocher insists on its reality and multidimensional consequences.
- **Guilt** - the forensic/legal standing before God that flows from solidarity with Adam; real imputation or representation is affirmed.
- **Pollution** - moral corruption or depravity of human nature; explains proclivity to sin and damaged volition.
- **Death** - spiritual estrangement and eventual physical mortality; both present and eschatologically destined to be overcome in Christ.
- **Federal headship / representative solidarity** - Adam as covenant head; Blocher uses this to explain corporate responsibility without crude biological determinism.
- **Participation (in Adam)** - theological category to describe how humans are "in" Adam; mediates imputation and ontological change.
- **Imputation (forensic)** - doctrine of guilt being reckoned to sinners; Blocher retains imputation but locates it within a broader account.
- **Seminal transmission** - the idea of transmission of sinful nature; Blocher treats it cautiously, avoiding genetic determinism while acknowledging a transmitted corruption.
- **Augustinian realism** - background influence; Blocher affirms realism but moderates some Augustinian formulations.
- **Pelagianism (contrast)** - denial of inherited guilt/corruption; Blocher explicitly opposes this minimization.
- **Exegetical locus: Genesis 3 / Romans 5** - primary biblical bases; Blocher models close reading of these texts.
- **Soteriological corollary** - Christ as second Adam reverses guilt, purifies pollution, and defeats death.
- **Theological anthropology** - humans as created good yet fallen; Blocher balances dignity and depravity.
- **Pastoral application** - doctrine explains human need for grace and shapes proclamation of justification and sanctification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** in hamartiology/systematic treatments to hold together forensic and ontological dimensions.
- As a **polemic** against Pelagian and liberal reductions and against crude biological determinisms.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis 3 and Romans 5 that integrates historical and theological concerns.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: the guilt/pollution/death triad organizes lectures and sermons on sin and salvation.
