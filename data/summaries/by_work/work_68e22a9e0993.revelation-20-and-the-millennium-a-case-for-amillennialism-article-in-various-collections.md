### TITLE
Revelation 20 and the Millennium: A Case for Amillennialism - Robert B. Strimple

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/evangelical theological milieu; written against a backdrop of renewed premillennial and dispensational interest in Revelation. Often reprinted in collections addressing eschatological controversy.
 - Reflects the scholarly move in Reformed circles to recover Augustinian and historic amillennial readings against literalistic futurism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Revelation 20 should be read amillennially: the "thousand years" is symbolic of Christ's present, intermediate reign; the binding of Satan is accomplished in principle at the Cross and realized in the church-age restraint of evil; the "first resurrection" is spiritual/representative, not a bodily resurrection preceding a future earthly millennium.
 - Doctrinal problem addressed: What is the nature and timing of Christ's kingdom and the final state? How to interpret Revelation 20 in a coherent theological system?

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical groundwork: grammatical-historical reading of Revelation 20 in canonical context (chapters 19-22) and comparison with Pauline and Johannine eschatology.
 - Symbolic character:
 - Argues "thousand years" is a symbolic number consistent with apocalyptic usage elsewhere, not an instruction for a literal chronological epoch.
 - The imagery of binding, reign, and resurrections must be read within apocalyptic symbolism and New Testament theology.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Binds the text to **already/not-yet** eschatology: Christ's victory inaugurated but consummation postponed until Parousia.
 - Interprets the "first resurrection" as the new-life participation of believers (spiritual regeneration or the blessedness of martyrs), with the bodily resurrection still reserved for the end.
 - Polemical deployment:
 - Counsels against reading Revelation as a timetable for geopolitical events; critiques the hermeneutical presuppositions of dispensational premillennialism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Augustine and the Augustinian tradition as the historical backbone of amillennialism.
 - Engages contemporary premillennial interpreters and dispensationalists; interacts with other Reformed scholars advocating amillennial positions.
 - Uses canonical cross-references (Paul, John) and apocalyptic genre studies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, resurrection, final judgment)
 - Christology (present reign of Christ)
 - Soteriology (first/second resurrection as spiritual vs. final)
 - Ecclesiology (church as locus of Christ's reign)
 - Satanology (binding and final defeat)
 - Revelation/Scripture (hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature)

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically, Strimple centers Revelation 20 in the doctrine of Christ's inaugurated but yet-to-be-consummated reign: the millennium symbolizes the church-age reign of Christ and the restraint of evil until final judgment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes the **canonical-theological** reading over speculative chronological reconstruction; treats Revelation as theological exhortation rather than a prophetic timetable.
 - Places the "first resurrection" squarely in the realm of present, spiritual realities (participation in Christ), rather than as a preliminary bodily rising.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects dispensational literalism by challenging its presupposition of a strictly chronological, earthly thousand-year epoch.
 - Contrasts with historicist schemes that read Revelation as long-term church history; Strimple keeps the symbolism christocentric and pastoral, not programmatic.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines how "binding" is read: not absolute removal but redemptive restraint consistent with Christus Victor inaugurated at the Cross.
 - Reframes "first resurrection" language to allow a dual sense (spiritual/representative and final physical), avoiding ad hoc harmonizations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Served as a concise, pastoral-amplified statement for Reformed educators and pastors confronting premillennial popularizations.
 - Cited in seminary courses and handbooks as a reliable amillennial exposition rooted in traditional Reformed theology.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Clear model of integrating careful exegesis with systematic theology.
 - Helpful corrective to literalist eschatologies; useful for preaching that emphasizes the present reign and hope of consummation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Millennium (the thousand years)** - Symbolic period; interpreted as the present church-age reign of Christ rather than a literal future earthly millennium.
- **Amillennialism** - Eschatological position affirming an inaugurated kingdom and non-literal thousand-year period.
- **Thousand years (chilia)** - Apocalyptic numeric symbolism; not a strict chronometer.
- **Binding of Satan** - Redemptive restraint inaugurated at the Cross, limiting Satan's deception so the gospel can spread.
- **First resurrection** - Primarily spiritual/representative (believers' new life, martyrs' vindication); not necessarily a bodily resurrection preceding a literal millennium.
- **Second death** - Final, eternal condemnation after final judgment.
- **Already/not-yet** - Framework employed to explain inaugurated eschatological realities and future consummation.
- **Christ's present reign** - Central motif: Christ rules now through the church and word, consummated at Parousia.
- **Symbolic/apocalyptic language** - Emphasizes genre sensitivity in Revelation interpretation.
- **Futurism/Premillennialism** - Opposed hermeneutical model that anticipates a distinct future earthly reign of Christ.
- **Augustinian tradition** - Historical lineage appealed to for amillennial readings.
- **Historicist reading** - Distinguished from Strimple's canonical-theological approach; he resists historicist allegorizing.
- **Restraint theology** - Term for the doctrine that evil is presently held back, enabling gospel mission.
- **Canonical correlation** - Method: relate Revelation 20 to broader New Testament teaching (Paul, John).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading apocalyptic texts within canonical theology rather than chronological prophecy charts.
 - As a **polemic source** against dispensational/premillennial literalism in pastoral and academic debates.
 - As a **definition source** for teaching amillennial concepts in seminary courses and Reformed catechetics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sermons and lectures emphasizing Christ's present reign and the already/not-yet structure of salvation history.
