### TITLE
Warranted Christian Belief (2000) - Alvin Plantinga

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic philosophy of religion; continuation and refinement of Reformed epistemology begun in the 1980s-90s.
 - Positioned against evidentialism and classical foundationalism; dialogue with contemporary epistemologists (internalists and externalists). (Topic: Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God)
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian belief can be rationally held and constitute knowledge because it can possess *warrant* - a property stronger than mere true belief or propositional justification - particularly when produced by properly functioning cognitive faculties, including the work of the Holy Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines *warrant*: that which, when added to true belief, yields knowledge; distinct from justification and evidence.
 - Develops a *proper function* account: warrant arises when cognitive faculties operate as they were designed to, in a suitable environment, with a purpose to produce true beliefs.
 - Applies proper function account to religious belief:
 - Argues for the legitimacy of the *sensus divinitatis* (a faculty producing belief in God) as properly basic.
 - Explores how Christian belief gains additional warrant through the internal testimony of the Holy Spirit and the noetic effects of sin as defeaters.
 - Treats defeaters and rational challenge: how warranted belief can be undermined and how Christians may rebut defeaters.
 - Concludes with conditions under which Christian doctrines (including propositional content of Christianity) can be warranted.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages evidentialists (e.g., W.K. Clifford-style critiques), contemporary epistemologists (William Alston, Roderick Chisholm, Richard Feldman, Earl Conee), and earlier Reformed/Christian thinkers (Calvin, Augustine) for theological resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and the role of the Holy Spirit in producing religious belief; the epistemic status of religious experience and testimony; noetic effects of sin; less focus on systematic dogmatics (Trinity, Christology) than on epistemic status of belief in those doctrines.
- **Closing line**
 - Plantinga locates the theological center of gravity in a theistic epistemology: Christian belief can be *warranted* when human cognitive faculties function as intended and when God (via the sensus divinitatis/Holy Spirit) appropriately sustains belief - thus bridging Reformed theological claims about divine agency with an externalist epistemology. (Topic: Existence And Knowability Of God)

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Shifts debate from justification/evidence to *warrant* as the crucial epistemic category.
 - Integrates theological claims (sensus divinitatis, Spirit's internal testimony) with a technical epistemology (proper function).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with evidentialist insistence that religious belief requires propositional evidence; rejects the notion that proper basicality is illegitimate without evidential support.
 - Moves beyond earlier Reformed epistemology by offering a fuller externalist account (vs. simple appeals to "properly basic").
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The formalization of *warrant* as distinct from justification and knowledge.
 - Use of biological/design language (design plan, cognitive design plan) applied to epistemology without committing to explicit creationist metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in evangelical and Reformed circles; revitalized philosophical theology and pastoral epistemology.
 - Provoked sustained critique from evidentialists and some analytic philosophers concerned about defeaters, epistemic circularity, and reliability standards.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for discussing religious epistemology that is both philosophically rigorous and theologically sympathetic.
 - Serves as a central text when teaching Christian epistemology or defending the rationality of religious belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Warrant**
 - The quality that, if added to true belief, makes it knowledge; central epistemic aim of the book.
- **Proper function**
 - Cognitive faculties working as they were designed to in an appropriate environment for the purpose of forming true beliefs.
- **Sensus divinitatis**
 - A natural faculty producing belief in God; candidate for properly basic source of theistic belief.
- **Properly basic belief**
 - Beliefs rationally held without inferential evidence; Plantinga defends the possibility for theistic/basic Christian claims.
- **Defeaters / Noetic effects of sin**
 - Conditions or beliefs that undermine warrant; sin can produce pervasive defeaters for theistic belief.
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**
 - A theological mechanism by which Christian belief may receive added warrant; interacts with epistemic notions without reducing to subjective feeling.
- **Design plan / cognitive design plan**
 - The specification of how faculties are supposed to function; central to proper function account.
- **Epistemic environment**
 - The circumstances in which faculties operate (truth-conducive vs. distorted by sin or pathology).
- **Externalism vs internalism**
 - Plantinga adopts an externalist tilt: warrant depends on factors beyond subjective access.
- **Defensive strategy against evidentialism**
 - Argues that evidentialist requirements are too strict and atheologically biased.
- **Warranted Christian belief (specific)**
 - The subset of Christian doctrinal beliefs that can achieve warrant given proper functioning and Spirit-enabled responsiveness.
- **Great Pumpkin objection**
 - An informal objection Plantinga addresses: that claiming any belief is properly basic could justify absurd beliefs; Plantinga responds by appeal to proper function and defeaters.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "warrant" and "proper function" in analytic theology and epistemology.
- As a **polemic** against evidentialist critiques of religious belief and as a **conceptual pivot** linking theology (sensus divinitatis, Spirit) with contemporary epistemology.
