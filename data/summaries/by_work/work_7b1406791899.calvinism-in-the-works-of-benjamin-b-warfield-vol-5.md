### TITLE
Calvinism (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, vol. 5) - concentrated notes on Warfield's defense of **common grace** and his treatment of **preparatory grace**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton environment; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed theologian responding to both liberal theology and internal Reformed disputes (hyper-Calvinism, Amyraldianism, Arminianism). The essay/lectures summarize and defend classical Calvinism for church and academy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Calvinism must consistently hold God's sovereign, discriminating saving grace (special/efficacious) while also accounting for God's non‑saving benevolence and providential dealings toward the non-elect (common grace) without collapsing the two.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Define and vindicate **common grace**: its biblical basis, historical articulation, and practical effects (cultural gifts, moral restraint, civil order).
 - Distinguish sharply between **common (non-saving) grace** and **special (saving, efficacious) grace**; insist that common grace never results in salvation.
 - Treat **preparatory grace** as a category to be used with caution: acknowledge providential means that may appear to "prepare" persons (preaching, external call, moral influence) but deny that such preparation is equivalent to or sufficient for regeneration.
 - Critique views that either deny common grace (leading to antinomian or sectarian withdrawal) or that assimilate common/preparatory grace into a universal salvific influence (leading toward Arminianism or Amyraldian universal intent).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformed scholastic sources, Westminster tradition, contemporary Princeton debates; polemics directed at hyper‑Calvinists, Arminians, Amyraldians, and liberal theological trends that reject divine sovereignty. Uses Scripture, confessional standards, and pastoral concerns.
- **Doctrines treated:** soteriology (effectual calling, regeneration), providence, anthropology (total depravity), ecclesiology in relation to preaching and the means of grace, and moral/political implications of common grace.
- **Closing line:** Warfield centers Calvinism as a doctrine of two distinct orders of divine favor - **common grace** for the world and **special, efficacious grace** for the elect - guarding both God's universal benevolence and particular saving sovereignty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Robust, systematic defense of **common grace** as theologically necessary to account for culture, science, arts, and civic morality apart from saving faith.
 - Careful lexical separation: Warfield insists language and categories must prevent conflation of non-saving divine influences with regeneration.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on hyper‑Calvinists who minimize or reject common grace and thus undermine mission and public engagement.
 - Opposes Amyraldian or Arminian tendencies that make preparatory/common grace the efficient cause of faith.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims and refines the term **preparatory grace**: useful as a descriptive category for providential antecedents to conversion but not a theological synonym for efficacious grace.
 - Emphasizes a two-tiered economy of grace that preserves God's particularity in salvation without denying providential benevolence toward all.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed circles and the Princeton school; provided later Reformed theologians with a disciplined vocabulary for public theology, missions, and cultural engagement.
 - Served as a corrective to both sectarian isolationism and theological liberalism in early 20th-century American Protestantism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for clarifying evangelistic practice (preaching to all while knowing conversion is the work of special grace) and for grounding Christian social involvement without theological syncretism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace** - God's non‑saving benevolent acts toward the non‑elect: cultural gifts, moral restraint, providential blessings.
- **Special (saving / efficacious) grace** - Sovereign, effectual grace that actually regenerates and converts the elect.
- **Preparatory grace** - Providential antecedents (preaching, conscience, circumstances) that may "prepare" but do not itself effect regeneration; a descriptive, not salvific, category.
- **Total depravity** - Human inability to achieve saving faith apart from special grace; basis for distinguishing common from saving grace.
- **Effectual calling / Irresistible grace** - The inner, efficacious work of God that results in regeneration and saving faith.
- **Common providence** - God's governance of the world that undergirds common grace phenomena (order, restraint, provision).
- **Moral government theory** - Warfield opposes any theory that reduces salvation to a moral example or governmental appeal mediated by common grace.
- **Hypothetical universalism (Amyraldian contrast)** - A theological rival that Warfield critiques for blurring particularity of saving grace.
- **Means of grace** - Preaching and sacraments as instruments; Warfield insists they mediate Christ's saving grace to the elect while benefiting society more broadly by common grace.
- **Non‑saving gifts** - Scientific, aesthetic, and civic goods that are fruits of common grace.
- **Restraint of sin** - A specific function of common grace preventing society's total collapse and enabling ordered life.
- **Preaching as occasion** - Preaching can be an occasion of preparatory influences but only special grace effects conversion.
- **Two orders of grace** - Warfield's shorthand for the structural distinction central to his argument.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed accounts of common vs special grace in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** against hyper‑Calvinism, Amyraldianism, and theological liberalism.
- As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for preaching and evangelism that preserves God's sovereignty and human responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of Christian cultural engagement and the legitimacy of non‑saving divine goods.
