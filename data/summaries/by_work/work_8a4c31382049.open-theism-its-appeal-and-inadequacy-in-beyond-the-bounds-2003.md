### TITLE
**Open Theism: Its Appeal and Inadequacy** - Bruce Ware (essay in Beyond the Bounds, 2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2000s evangelical debate over Open Theism versus classical theism; contribution appears in a broadly conservative critique volume (Beyond the Bounds) responding to recent openness proponents (Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd, Hasker).
 - Stakes framed as pastoral, doctrinal, and exegetical: how God's knowledge, sovereignty, and relationality are to be understood in Scripture and life.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Open Theism appeals to biblical portrayals of God's relational give-and-take but is theologically inadequate because it misconstrues **divine condescension**, thereby undermining divine omniscience, immutability, providence, and the trustworthiness of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Open Theism's claims: God's future knowledge is partly open; God takes risks and learns; biblical anthropomorphisms reflect genuine change in God.
 - Analytic contrast with classical theism: divine foreknowledge, immutability, providence, and omniscience must be preserved to secure God's sovereignty and the trustworthiness of promises.
 - Focus on **divine condescension**: Ware stresses that Scripture uses anthropomorphic language to accommodate finite minds, not to teach ontological mutability in God.
 - Theological consequences surveyed:
 - Erosion of providential control and assurance in prayer.
 - Threats to biblical interpretation (e.g., interpreting predictive prophecy and divine repentance).
 - Practical pastoral damage: diminished confidence in God's promises and plans.
 - Conclusion: Open Theism's hermeneutical motive (protecting God's love and relationality) is legitimate, but its theological cost is unacceptable; a robust doctrine of accommodation preserves relationality without sacrificing God's perfections.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Primary opponents: Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Gregory Boyd, William Hasker (representatives of Open Theism).
 - Ware draws on classical Reformed/evangelical resources and engages exegetical examples from Old and New Testament narratives.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine attributes** (omniscience, immutability, sovereignty)
 - **Providence and foreknowledge**
 - **Biblical revelation and anthropomorphism / accommodation**
 - **Prayer and pastoral assurance**
 - Secondary touchpoints: human freedom, divine love, and how these intersect with doctrine of God.

- **Closing line**
 - Ware's theological center: preserve **God's dependable omniscience and immutability** while affirming genuine divine condescension-reject Open Theism as an inadequate way to honor both God's sovereignty and his relational engagement with creatures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp focus on **divine condescension** as the hermeneutical key: anthropomorphic biblical language is accommodation, not evidence of ontological change in God.
 - Systematic linking of doctrinal fidelity (omni-attributes) to pastoral trust and the efficacy of prayer.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Open Theists who read biblical relationality as metaphysical volatility; contrasts their hermeneutical method with a confessional, classical-theist hermeneutic that distinguishes accommodation from ontology.
 - Opposes the Open position that divine risk-taking is required to preserve genuine human freedom and relational authenticity.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Clarifies and defends the category of **accommodation/condescension** as distinct from change or ignorance in God.
 - Reinscribes biblical anthropomorphism into a sober doctrine of God that protects divine immutability.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical responses to Open Theism; used in seminary curricula as a concise, pastoral-theological rejoinder.
 - Strengthened classical-theist defenses of divine foreknowledge in subsequent literature; contributed to reframing the debate around biblical hermeneutics (accommodation).

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful compact resource for pastors and teachers worried about pastoral implications of Open Theism.
 - Clarifies how to retain biblical relational language without jettisoning core divine attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism**
 - The view that the future is (in important respects) open and that God does not exhaustively foreknow all future free choices.
- **Classical Theism**
 - Traditional stance affirming God's exhaustive foreknowledge, immutability, simplicity, and sovereignty.
- **Divine Condescension (Accommodation)**
 - Scripture's anthropomorphic, anthropopathic language designed to communicate truths to finite creatures without implying change in God; Ware insists this preserves divine immutability.
- **Omniscience**
 - God's exhaustive knowledge of past, present, and future; Ware defends this as essential for providence and trust.
- **Immutability**
 - God's unchanging nature; distinguished from relational responsiveness that does not imply ontological change.
- **Providence**
 - God's sovereign governance of events; Ware argues Open Theism weakens providential assurance.
- **Foreknowledge**
 - God's certain knowledge of future contingents; contrasted with Open Theism's epistemic/metaphysical openness.
- **Anthropomorphism / Anthropopathism**
 - Human-like descriptions of God's actions/emotions; treated as pedagogical, not literal alterations in divine being.
- **Divine Sovereignty**
 - God's control and purposefulness in history; Ware ties this to trust in promises and prayer.
- **Human Freedom**
 - Ware affirms genuine human freedom but resists framing it as incompatible with exhaustive divine foreknowledge.
- **Divine Repentance / Change**
 - Open Theists cite biblical "repentance" of God; Ware reinterprets as accommodative speech reflecting relational consequences without ontological shift.
- **Trust and Prayer**
 - Pastoral categories that depend on a dependable, foreknowing God; primary practical objection to Open Theism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against Open Theism in systematic theology and pastoral contexts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading anthropomorphic texts through the lens of accommodation/condescension.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: linking doctrine of God (attributes) with pastoral confidence and the practice of prayer.
