### TITLE
**Nouvelle Theologie and Sacramental Ontology** - Hans Boersma

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the context of 20th-21st century ressourcement debates; addresses the *nouvelle theologie* movement (mid-20th century France) and its retrieval of patristic metaphysics against neo-scholasticism and modern secular ontology.
 - Dialogue partner for contemporary Anglican/Reformed sacramental theology and for ecumenical liturgical renewal.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The *nouvelle theologie* recovers a **sacramental ontology**: the created order participates in and manifests the divine life; sacraments are ontological mediations, not merely symbolic signs.
 - This recovery challenges modern reductions that make sacraments subjective, merely juridical, or strictly representational.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of *nouvelle theologie* key thinkers (de Lubac, Congar, Daniélou, Chenu) and their patristic sources (Augustine, Dionysius) to show a coherent sacramental metaphysic.
 - Contrast with neo-scholastic and Kantian frameworks that privatize faith or turn grace into exclusively juridical relations.
 - Philosophical-theological articulation of sacramental ontology: participation, analogy of being, epiphany, and sacrament as real presence.
 - Practical and doctrinal implications: Eucharist, baptism, liturgy, revelation, and how a sacramental ontology reshapes doctrine of creation, incarnation, and eschatology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Henri de Lubac, Yves Congar, Jean Daniélou, Marie-Dominique Chenu.
 - Patristic sources: Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Eastern Fathers.
 - Interlocutors/contrasts: Neo-scholastic Thomism, Karl Barth, Protestant symbolic approaches, analytic/modern philosophical ontology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as epiphany), sacrament (nature and effect), incarnation, Trinity (participatory relations), creation (as sacramental), ecclesiology (Church as sacramental body), eschatology (telos of participation).

- **Closing line**
 - Boersma locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that Christian sacramental practice expresses a metaphysic of participation: the world is sacramentally ordered so that God's presence is ontologically mediated in creation, liturgy, and the sacraments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Argues for a restored **metaphysical realism** in theology where sacraments disclose ontological realities rather than merely signifying them.
 - Stresses patristic idioms of participation and epiphany over neo-scholastic juridical categories.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects neo-scholasticism's tendency to abstract sacraments into legal instruments by returning to sacramental causality and real presence.
 - Contrasts with Barthian dialectical separation and many Protestant symbolic readings by insisting on sacramental mediation of divine reality within creation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the explicit phrase **"sacramental ontology"** as a way to unite sacramental theology with metaphysical claims about being.
 - Develops the notion of **ontological conversion**: a shift in metaphysical presuppositions that allows one to see created things as revelatory.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant influence on Anglican and Reformed theologians seeking a robust sacramental realism (e.g., liturgical and eucharistic revivalists).
 - Provoked critique from skeptics who fear ontotheological presuppositions or collapse of Creator/creature distinction; debated in both Catholic and Protestant circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a model for integrating patristic metaphysics with contemporary sacramental and liturgical theology.
 - Serves as a resource for ecumenical conversations about the nature of sacraments, presence, and the theology of creation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramental ontology** - The view that sacraments are ontological mediations: created realities participate in and disclose God's life.
- **Ressourcement / nouvelle theologie** - Mid-20th-century movement returning to patristic sources to renew theology against neo-scholastic flattening.
- **Participation (participatio)** - Key metaphysical principle: creatures share in divine being without identity; basis for sacramental efficacy.
- **Analogia entis** - Analogical relation between God and creature; grounds theological language and sacramental realism.
- **Epiphany** - Revelation as manifestation; sacraments function as epiphanic events in which God discloses presence.
- **Metaphysical realism** - Commitment to a reality that theology can describe metaphysically, resisting Kantian reduction of knowledge to subjective conditions.
- **Ontological conversion** - The methodological shift required to see liturgy and sacraments as constitutive of the world's ordering toward God.
- **Real presence** - Not merely symbolic or juridical but ontological: Christ's presence mediates being, particularly in Eucharist.
- **Neo-scholasticism (critique)** - Portrayed as reducing sacraments to juridical or instrumental categories, severing patristic depth.
- **Creator-creature distinction (guarded)** - While sacramental ontology affirms participation, it still maintains distinction (critically debated in receptions).
- **Liturgy as locus theologicus** - Liturgy functions as theological school where healing of ontology and theology occurs.
- **Eschatological telos** - Creation's sacramental ordering is oriented to the eschatological fullness of participation in God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary sacramental realism and the phrase "sacramental ontology."
- As a **polemic** against neo-scholastic, Kantian, and purely symbolic Protestant accounts of the sacraments.
- As an **exegetical and patristic model** for reading Augustine, Dionysius, and ressourcement authors as metaphysicians of participation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in liturgical theology and ecumenical discussions about real presence and the theology of creation.
