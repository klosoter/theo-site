### TITLE
Privacy In Context: Technology, Policy, and the Integrity of Social Life - Helen Nissenbaum (2009)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid rising attention to digital data practices (late 2000s): social media expansion, ubiquitous computing, RFID, search engines.
 - Situated in interdisciplinary technology policy, legal theory, and information ethics rather than traditional theological discourse.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Privacy should be understood as **contextual integrity**: the moral and political value of preserving appropriate information flows according to the governing norms of distinct social contexts, not merely secrecy, control, or autonomy.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Critique of prevailing accounts:
 - Rejects privacy as mere secrecy, control over information, or individual autonomy.
 - Argues these accounts fail to capture social norms that make information flows appropriate or harmful.
 - Positive proposal:
 - Introduces **contextual integrity** as a normative standard based on appropriate informational norms.
 - Develops an analytic framework of parameters that determine informational norms (context, actors, attributes, transmission principles).
 - Application and policy work:
 - Applies framework to concrete cases (medical records, financial data, online behavior, RFID, search engines).
 - Shows how technological change disrupts contextual norms and suggests policy/design remedies to restore integrity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages privacy literature: Warren & Brandeis (secrecy), Alan Westin (privacy as control), contemporary legal scholars and technologists.
 - Draws on social theory about institutional practices and norms (implicitly comparative with Foucaultian concerns about surveillance).
 - Empirical examples from information studies, computer science, law, and public policy debates.
- **Doctrines treated (theologically mapped)**
 - While not theological, the work bears on ecclesial and doctrinal concerns when mapped to:
 - **Revelation and disclosure**: norms governing what is revealed in relational and liturgical contexts.
 - **Confession and pastoral care**: appropriate bounds and obligations in sensitive testimony.
 - **Covenant and communal trust**: informational norms as covenantal expectations within communities.
 - **Personhood and agency**: relational models of the self (vs. atomized autonomy).
 - These mappings are interpretive uses of Nissenbaum for theological reflection, not claims in the book.
- **Closing line**
 - Privacy, understood theologically and ethically, is the preservation of **contextual integrity**-the normative fabric that makes disclosure meaningful, relationships trustworthy, and social life coherent amid technological change.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Privileges **contextual norms** over individualistic or technological metaphors; treats privacy as socially constituted and norm-regulated.
 - Offers an operational analytic (parameters) that is both descriptive and normative.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects autonomy/control models (Westin) by showing they cannot explain intuitions about context-sensitive breaches (e.g., social media sharing vs. clinical disclosure).
 - Moves beyond secrecy models (Warren & Brandeis) by focusing on the appropriateness of flow, not mere concealment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Coined and systematically developed **"contextual integrity"** as a principle and tool for analysis.
 - Formalized four parameters of informational norms: **context, actors, attributes, transmission principles**.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Limited direct theological citation but widely influential in law, information ethics, design ethics, and technology policy.
 - Adopted in theological ethics when engaging digital pastoral care, confidentiality, and ecclesial data practices as a more socially robust alternative to autonomy-centered moral reasoning.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a durable framework for analyzing privacy across contexts (church, hospital, marketplace).
 - Useful pedagogically for linking moral theory, social norms, and concrete technology design/policy choices.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Contextual integrity**
 - Central normative principle: privacy preserved when information flows conform to context-specific norms.
- **Informational norms**
 - The patterned expectations that govern what disclosures are appropriate in a given context.
- **Context**
 - Social sphere or domain (e.g., medicine, family, worship, education) with its own purposes and norms.
- **Actors**
 - Senders, recipients, and subjects of information; roles matter morally and normatively.
- **Attributes**
 - Types of information (sensitive, mundane) that carry different normative weight in contexts.
- **Transmission principles**
 - Rules governing how information is transmitted (consent, confidentiality, anonymity, reciprocity).
- **Appropriateness**
 - The evaluative judgment that a particular information flow matches the governing norms of a context.
- **Flow disruption**
 - Technological changes or institutional shifts that render established norms inapplicable, creating privacy harms.
- **Expectation vs. norm**
 - Distinguishes empirical expectations from normative standards; both matter for assessing integrity.
- **Privacy vs. secrecy/autonomy/control**
 - Clarifies privacy as patterned appropriateness, not merely concealment or individual command over data.
- **Design and policy implication**
 - Framework used as a blueprint for privacy-by-design and regulatory evaluation.
- **Heuristic for adjudication**
 - Offers a method for resolving conflicts of informational norms across overlapping contexts.
- **Relational model of personhood**
 - Implicit shift toward social/relational accounts over atomistic subjects in privacy ethics.
- **Norm change and remediation**
 - Diagnoses when and how policy or design should restore or reconstitute contextual norms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** of privacy in ethics and law courses (contextual integrity as canonical).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in moral theology and pastoral ethics to shift analysis from individual autonomy to communal norms.
 - As a **policy/design model** for ecclesial data practices, healthcare confidentiality, and digital sacramental contexts.
