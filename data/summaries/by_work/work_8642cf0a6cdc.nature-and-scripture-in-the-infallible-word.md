### TITLE
Nature and Scripture (essay in The Infallible Word) - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed apologetic milieu; Van Til teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary, elaborating a presuppositional critique of classical and evidentialist apologetics.
 - Engages contemporary defenders of natural theology and those who presuppose autonomous human reason.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Nature is not an autonomous revelation** that can stand as a neutral epistemic ground; Scripture alone orders and makes intelligible the creaturely world and human knowing. The dependence of nature on God entails the priority and sufficiency of Scripture for theological and salvific knowledge.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expose the implicit **Pelagian/Semi‑Pelagian tendencies** in appeals to unaided human reason: natural ability to know God or attain saving truth is inadequate.
 - Argue for the **psychosomatic unity** of the human person: sin affects the whole cognitive agent, so epistemology cannot be compartmentalized (reason vs. will).
 - Introduce the counterfactual thought experiment (**What if Adam had not sinned?**) to show that even innocent knowledge would be creaturely and contingent - divine revelation remains normative.
 - Develop a presuppositional epistemology: all knowing presupposes theological commitments; Scripture supplies the covenantal framework that orients interpretation of nature.
 - Conclude that the **Image of God** in humanity constrains but does not replace dependence on revelation for true theological knowledge.

- **Figures / interlocutors**
 - Classical apologists and natural theologians (e.g., Thomistic or evidentialist approaches) and implicit contrasts with Pelagianism/Semi‑Pelagianism.
 - Builds on Kuyperian antithesis and Reformed Augustinian anthropology; anticipates Greg Bahnsen, John Frame responses.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs general), epistemology, anthropology (Image of God, original sin), sin and its reach (psychosomatic unity), natural theology critique, sufficiency of Scripture.

- **Closing line**
 - Scripture is the authoritative, covenantal key that alone rightly orders creaturely knowledge; nature testifies only within the framework Scripture provides.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insists on a radical theological epistemology: no neutral ground between believer and unbeliever; presuppositions govern interpretation of nature.
 - Uses the hypothetical of an unfallen Adam to underline the contingency and creaturely dependence of human knowing - a novel pedagogical device.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical and evidentialist apologetics that treat nature or reason as a co‑equal witness to God; accuses them of smuggling in Pelagian assumptions about human ability.
 - Contrasts with naive natural theology by arguing that general revelation never provides saving knowledge apart from special revelation.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematizes the antithesis into epistemology: the idea that the believer's and unbeliever's presuppositions produce incommensurable interpretive frameworks.
 - Emphasizes **psychosomatic unity** to reject compartmentalized accounts of cognition and moral responsibility.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Reformed presuppositional apologetics; deeply influential for students of Van Til, Bahnsen, and some streams of conservative Reformed theology.
 - Contested by classical apologists and some in Reformed circles (e.g., John Frame offers modifications), but widely adopted as a corrective to naturalistic equilibria.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to assumptions of autonomous reason; valuable for teaching apologetics, Reformed epistemology, and theological anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Nature**
 - Creaturely order and general revelation; not autonomous revelation but dependent and intelligible only within Scripture's framework.

- **Scripture / Sufficiency of Scripture**
 - Normative and decisive for interpreting nature; supplies the presuppositions necessary for true knowledge.

- **Presupposition / Antithesis**
 - Foundational theological commitments that determine interpretation; the believer/unbeliever divide shapes all reasoning.

- **Transcendental argument (implicit)**
 - Van Til's move that the possibility of intelligible experience presupposes the Christian God and Scriptures as its warrant.

- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Human person is an integrated body‑soul agent; sin corrupts the whole person, so epistemic impairment is comprehensive.

- **Image of God (Imago Dei)**
 - Grounds human capacity for knowledge and responsibility but does not permit autonomous salvific knowledge apart from revelation.

- **Original sin / Augustinianism vs Pelagianism / Semi‑Pelagianism**
 - Van Til aligns with Augustinian emphasis on sin's total effects; criticizes Pelagian and Semi‑Pelagian confidence in natural abilities to reach God.

- **What if Adam had not sinned (Hypothetical Adam)**
 - Counterfactual device showing that even unfallen cognition would remain creaturely and dependent on God - thus Scripture's priority is not merely remedial.

- **Natural theology**
 - Critiqued as illegitimately elevating general revelation to independent epistemic authority.

- **Common grace (implicit)**
 - Explains some shared rational capacities, but must be bounded by the antithesis and does not neutralize presuppositional difference.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional apologetics and anti‑Pelagian epistemology.
 - As a **polemic** against classical/evidentialist natural theology and claims of autonomous reason.
 - As an **anthropological and exegetical pivot**: to teach the Reformed view of Imago Dei, original sin, and the necessity of Scripture for ordering human knowledge.
