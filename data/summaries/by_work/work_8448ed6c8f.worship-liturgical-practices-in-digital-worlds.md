### TITLE
Worship: Liturgical Practices in Digital Worlds - Teresa Berger

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary (21st century) conversation at the intersection of liturgical theology, ritual studies, media studies, and pastoral practice.
 - Emerges from ecumenical and feminist liturgical scholarship responding to rapid digital mediation of worship (social media, livestream, VR).
 - Methodologically interdisciplinary: ethnography, ritual theory, theological reflection, and media theory.

- **Central thesis**
 - Digital media do not merely transmit existing worship; they reconfigure liturgical practice, perception of presence, communal identity, and sacramental imagination. Liturgical theology must attend to the affordances and limits of mediated worship to discern theological, ecclesial, and ethical implications.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: maps modalities of digital worship (live-streaming, synchronous/asynchronous interactions, VR/avatars) and identifies recurring tensions (presence/absence, embodiment/disembodiment, locality/translocality).
 - Theological analysis: reads these phenomena through liturgical theology-sacramentality, ritual performativity, assembly-and through media theory (presence, remediation, affordances).
 - Interventions:
 - Rejects simple binary of "authentic" in-person worship versus "inauthentic" online worship.
 - Proposes criteria for evaluating mediated liturgies (ritual coherence, ethical formation, ecclesial accountability, sacramental integrity).
 - Highlights pastoral and ecclesial practices for responsible, theologically informed deployment of digital worship.
 - Methodological appendices: case studies and descriptive analyses of actual online liturgies to ground theological claims.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on ritual theorists (e.g., Catherine Bell-type performativity), media theorists (McLuhan-ish presence/medium reflections; remediation concepts), and contemporary digital religion scholars (e.g., Heidi Campbell).
 - Interlocution with liturgical theologians and sacramentalists, feminist theologians attentive to embodiment, and practitioners (pastors, worship leaders).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology**: what constitutes an assembly when networked; authority and belonging in dispersed communities.
 - **Sacramentality**: mediated signs, presence of Christ, and criteria for sacramental validity/efficacy in digital contexts.
 - **Anthropology/Embodiment**: bodily presence, haptics, and sensory regimes in worship.
 - **Ethics and pastoral theology**: responsibility, access, power/inequality, privacy.
 - Secondary engagement with Trinity (relationality as analogue for mediated communion) and eschatological imagination (the "already/not yet" of presence).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Liturgical practice in digital worlds demands a theology that treats mediation not as neutral technology but as formative of communal presence, sacramental imagination, and ecclesial identity; theology must therefore discern, not dismiss, the theological possibilities and risks of mediated worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on ritual performativity and sensory regimes rather than solely on doctrinal legitimacy.
 - Attentive to lived practices and the micro-structures of online liturgy (chat functions, visual framing, timing), linking these to theological consequences.
 - Prioritizes ethical-pastoral concerns (accessibility, surveillance, commercialization) alongside sacramental questions.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both techno-utopian claims that digital worship is an unalloyed extension of presence and technophobic claims that online worship is inherently inauthentic.
 - Offers an alternative to purely media-determinist readings by emphasizing ecclesial agency, liturgical intentionality, and ritual design.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys terms such as **mediated sacramentality**, **networked assembly**, and **liturgical virtuality** to capture hybrid spaces where presence is negotiated.
 - Uses "affordances" (from media studies) in liturgical evaluation: what practices media enable or disable for worship formation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in contemporary liturgical studies, digital religion research, and pastoral formation courses that address online worship.
 - Received as a corrective resource among progressive, ecumenical, and feminist liturgists; more cautious uptake among traditional sacramentalists who prioritize canonical/formal criteria for sacraments.
 - Cited in practical guides for congregations transitioning to hybrid worship models.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for assessing new media impacts on worship without reductionism.
 - Useful for seminaries, parish leaders, and liturgists seeking ethically and theologically coherent digital worship practices.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mediated presence** - how presence is experienced, signaled, and negotiated through media technologies.
- **Networked assembly** - conception of the church as dispersed, connected via networks rather than confined to physical locale.
- **Mediated sacramentality** - the theological category for sacramental signs when conveyed or augmented by digital means.
 - Distinguish from canonical sacramental validity; focuses on sacramental imagination and formation.
- **Liturgical virtuality** - the qualitative state of liturgical events mediated by digital platforms (not merely "virtual" as unreal).
- **Affordances** - capabilities and constraints that particular media impose on liturgical practice (e.g., chat, latency, visual framing).
- **Intermediality** - interplay of multiple media/sensory modalities in worship (audio, visual, text, haptic cues).
- **Performativity** - ritual acts as constitutive of communal identity, even when mediated.
- **Embodiment / disembodiment** - tensions and reconfigurations of bodily presence in digital worship.
- **Ritual coherence** - criterion for evaluating the theological integrity and intelligibility of mediated rites.
- **Ethical-pastoral accountability** - responsibilities around privacy, commercialization, inclusion, and pastoral care in digital worship.
- **Sacramental imagination** - communal interpretive frames that allow sacramental meaning to emerge or falter in mediated contexts.
- **Spatial-temporal refiguration** - how digital worship collapses distance and reorders liturgical time and place.
- **Hybrid liturgy** - planned mixes of in-person and mediated elements; normative practices for many congregations.
- **Liturgical design** - practical theological discipline of crafting rites informed by media affordances.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for ecclesiology and sacramental theology when accounting for dispersed assemblies.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for designing and evaluating hybrid/digital liturgies in pastoral and liturgical formation contexts.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against technophobia and naive techno-utopianism, supplying nuanced criteria for theological assessment.
