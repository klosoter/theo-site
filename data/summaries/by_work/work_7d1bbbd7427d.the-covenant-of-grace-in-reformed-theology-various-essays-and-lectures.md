### TITLE
**The Covenant of Grace in Reformed Theology** - essays and lectures by Peter A. Lillback

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical milieu (late 20th-early 21st century): retrieval and defense of classical federal theology in seminary and pulpit contexts.
 - Addresses historical sources (Reformation and post-Reformation divines) and contemporary debates within covenant theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Covenant of Grace is the sustained, organic fulfillment and continuation of God's redemptive purpose after the fall; it must be articulated as a single, Christ-centered covenantal economy distinct from, yet related to, the Covenant of Works.
 - The task: preserve covenant continuity without diminishing the legal/obligatory content of God's dealings (i.e., avoid both radical continuity that collapses distinctions and radical discontinuity that fragments redemptive history).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base: careful treatment of key Old and New Testament covenant passages that promise salvation through a mediator.
 - Historical-theological synthesis: traces how Calvin, the Reformed orthodox, and the Westminster divines developed the Covenant of Grace schema.
 - Doctrinal construction: defines the parties, terms, mediator, and seals of the Covenant of Grace; locates its relation to the Covenant of Works.
 - Pastoral and sacramental implications: argues that sacraments, ministry, and preaching are covenantal means under the one redemptive covenant.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: John Calvin, Reformed orthodox writers, Westminster Confession/authors.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: modern covenant theologians and critics (those emphasizing discontinuity or reconfiguring covenant categories).
 - Uses patristic, biblical, and confessional texts to ground claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and covenantal structure; divine law; Christology (mediatorship and federal headship); soteriology (union with Christ, justification as covenantal benefit); sacramentology (signs and seals of covenant promises); ecclesiology (church as covenant community); typology and redemptive history.

- **Closing line**
 - Lillback centers Reformed theology on a **single, Christ-mediated Covenant of Grace** that preserves divine covenant faithfulness and legal obligations while grounding salvation historically and sacramen­tally in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong retrieval of classical federal language: explicit articulation of Covenant of Works vis-a-vis Covenant of Grace as complementary, not conflated.
 - Robust Christocentrism: every covenantal promise is read through the person and office of Christ as mediator and federal head.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against approaches that either (a) collapse the covenants into a single undifferentiated economy or (b) create excessive discontinuity (e.g., some dispensational or novel "new covenant" schemes).
 - Corrects modern minimizations of the Covenant of Works by reaffirming its covenantal/legal character as background to grace.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies terminology to preserve functional distinctions: "covenant of works" as covenant of law/obligation, "covenant of grace" as covenant of promise/fulfillment in Christ.
 - Emphasizes covenant as both relational (party-to-party) and juridical (obligation/penalty/mediator).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed seminaries and churches as a teaching resource and corrective.
 - Cited in debates on covenant continuity, sacramental practice, and pastoral theology; less persuasive to scholars favoring more radical reformulations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for historical retrieval, pastoral catechesis, and clear exegetical arguments for covenantal reading of Scripture; serves as a reliable gateway into classical federal theology for students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The divinely established covenant promising salvation through a mediator; the central organizing principle of redemption history (primary topic use).
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The antecedent covenant with Adam stipulating life for obedience; serves as legal backdrop to the Covenant of Grace (site usage 2).
- **Federal Headship**
 - Concept of representative parties (Adam, Christ) whose obedience/disobedience accrues to their covenantal communities.
- **Mediator / Mediatorship of Christ**
 - Christ as the indispensable party who fulfills covenant conditions and secures the promises.
- **Promise and Demand (covenantal structure)**
 - Distinction between God's covenantal promises (grace) and the demands/penalties of covenant law (works).
- **Continuity and Discontinuity**
 - Lillback's balancing term: affirms organic continuity in redemptive purpose while maintaining typological discontinuity in form and administration.
- **Sign and Seal (Sacraments)**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenantal marks that confirm membership and promise in the Covenant of Grace.
- **Typology / Redemptive-Historical Reading**
 - Use of OT persons and institutions as types pointing forward to Christ and the covenant's fulfillment.
- **Confessional Sources**
 - Westminster standards and Reformed orthodox writings as normative reference points for doctrinal formulation.
- **Covenantal Nomism (structural)**
 - Descriptive: covenant as the organizing framework for law, promise, and election without obscuring forensic justification.
- **Ecclesial Implications**
 - Church understood as covenantal community, steward of the sacraments, and bearer of covenant promises.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for classical Covenant of Grace theology in seminary courses.
 - As a **polemic** and corrective against discontinuity models and novel covenant proposals.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture redemptively and sacramentally, and as a **conceptual pivot** for preaching and catechesis within Reformed churches.
