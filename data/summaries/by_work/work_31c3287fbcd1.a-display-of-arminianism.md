### TITLE
**A Display of Arminianism** - John Owen (17th‑century English Reformed polemic)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th‑century English Reformed/Puritan milieu amid post‑Restoration theological conflicts. Owen writes as a systematic defender of orthodox Calvinism against rising Arminian tendencies in England and on the Continent.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To expose and refute the theological system of Arminianism by demonstrating its internal incoherence and its incompatibility with Scripture and historic Reformed doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnostic exposition of Arminian propositions and terminologies.
 - Scriptural and logical refutation of key tenets (on sin, grace, election, faith, and covenant).
 - Positive affirmation of Reformed doctrines: original sin and total depravity, federal headship (covenant of works and covenant of grace), particular redemption as consistent with Scripture, and the necessity/effectiveness of divine grace (see topics below).
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, repentance, sanctification flow from proper doctrine of grace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Jacobus Arminius (as source); English and continental Arminian proponents and sympathizers (e.g., John Goodwin and other anti‑Calvinists of Owen's day), plus engagement with Scripture, church fathers, and Reformed confessions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sin and corruption (Nature and Origin of Sin), faith and repentance as effects of efficacious grace (Faith And Repentance), covenant theology with explicit defense of the Covenant of Works and its federal consequences (Covenant Of Works), election, imputation, justification, and the nature of saving grace.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Owen's work insists that true Christianity is rooted in sovereign, efficacious grace whose doctrines of sin, covenant, and redemption are logically and experientially inseparable from one another.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Keen insistence that doctrines of sin and divine sovereignty must be argued together: a robust doctrine of original sin (and its federal transmission) undergirds the necessity of sovereign grace.
 - Precision in distinguishing moral ability from saving ability: human will is morally blameworthy though not able to secure salvation without grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Arminian claims about conditional election, prevenient grace as neutral enabling, and human merit. Owen argues these undermine assurance and the sufficiency of Christ.
 - Contrasts with more synergistic Anglican/Baxterian positions by locating repentance and faith as divine gifts, not merely human responses.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic linking of federal headship (Adam's representational role) to personal guilt and incapacity, reinforcing the Reformed covenantal schema against Arminian individualism.
 - Clear operational use of "efficacious" versus "sufficient" grace to dismantle ambiguities in Arminian formulations.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in later Puritan and Reformed apologetics; served as a standard polemic and classroom text defending orthodox Calvinism in England and New England.
 - Provoked sustained rebuttals from Arminian and moderate non‑Calvinist theologians; cemented Owen's reputation as a principal Reformed antagonist of Arminianism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Model of careful theological polemic that combines exegetical argument, logical critique, and pastoral concern; valuable for students of doctrinal controversy, covenant theology, and the doctrine of sin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original Sin:** Owen treats it as real, federal, and transmissible - the root cause of human inability apart from grace (see Nature And Origin Of Sin).
- **Total Depravity:** Human faculties corrupted; no saving tendency apart from divine intervention.
- **Federal Headship / Adam as Representative:** Adam's covenantal failure imputed to his posterity; central to Owen's account of inherited guilt (Covenant Of Works).
- **Covenant of Works:** A pre‑lapsarian probation under Adam; its breach explains universal guilt and grounds the need for a covenant of grace.
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's salvific covenant fulfilled in Christ; Owen emphasizes its efficacy and particularity.
- **Efficacious (Irresistible) Grace:** Grace that accomplishes what it intends - producing faith and repentance (see Faith And Repentance).
- **Faith and Repentance:** Not mere human acts but Spirit‑wrought gifts and fruits of effectual calling; Owen distinguishes initial repentance from mere moral reformation.
- **Imputation:** Forensic reckoning of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness - key to justification and covenantal accounting.
- **Free Will (Libertarian vs. Bondage):** Owen repudiates libertarianism in salvation, affirming will is bound by sin such that grace must liberate it.
- **Sufficiency vs. Efficacy of Grace:** Grace is sufficient universally in provision but efficacious in application only where God intends.
- **Assurance:** A consequence of rightly ordered doctrine - assurance rests on objective acts of God (covenant, promises, Christ's work), not on uncertain human effort.
- **Forensic vs. Transformative Justification:** Owen attends to both the legal declaration and the sanctifying effects ensuing from regeneration.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a primary polemic source against Arminian positions in systematic theology classes.
 - As a definitional touchstone for Reformed accounts of original sin, covenant of works, and efficacy of grace.
 - As an exegetical and pastoral model for arguing that faith and repentance are gifts of the Spirit, not merely human responses.
