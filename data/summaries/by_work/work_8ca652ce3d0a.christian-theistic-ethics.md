### TITLE
**Christian Theistic Ethics** by **Cornelius Van Til**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Westminster Seminary syllabus-turned-book within the Reformed confessional tradition. Written amid debates with neo-orthodoxy, liberal Protestantism, Roman Catholic nature-grace schemas, and secular moral philosophies. Situated in Van Til's presuppositional project.
- **Central thesis:** True ethics is **theonomous** and **covenantal**, grounded in the self-attesting **triune God** revealed in Scripture. There is no ethical neutrality; all moral reasoning is either covenant-keeping or covenant-breaking. **Christ** and the **Spirit** restore ethical agency.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Method:** A transcendental, presuppositional critique of ethical autonomy; exposes the impossibility of morality without the triune Creator.
 - **Survey and critique of rivals:** Classical eudaimonism, Thomistic natural law as autonomous when detached from Scripture, Kantian duty, Hegelian historicism, existentialist subjectivism, pragmatism, and neo-orthodox actualism.
 - **Positive construction:** Ethics as covenantal submission to God's revealed will.
 - **Revelation:** General revelation real yet suppressed; special revelation normatively interprets it.
 - **God:** Ontological Trinity as the absolute-personal ground of moral universals and particulars.
 - **Anthropology:** Image-bearing, the Fall, noetic and moral corruption, common grace restraint.
 - **Law and covenant:** Decalogue and covenantal structure; law fulfilled and clarified in Christ.
 - **Soteriology and pneumatology:** Regeneration, union with Christ, sanctification, Spirit's illumination.
 - **Church and sacraments:** Ecclesial formation, discipline, sacraments as moral pedagogy.
 - **Providence and vocation:** Application of norms to situations under God's sovereign governance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Reformed confessional standards; Augustine, Calvin; Kuyper, Bavinck; critiques of Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Dewey; Barth and Brunner.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture; Trinity; creation, Fall, providence; covenant theology; Christology (obedience and fulfillment of law); soteriology (regeneration, sanctification); pneumatology (illumination, empowerment); ecclesiology and sacraments; eschatology and the kingdom.
- **Center of gravity:** **Ethics is covenantal obedience to the self-attesting triune Lord, interpreted by Scripture, realized in Christ by the Spirit, unto the glory of God.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:** 
 - **Presuppositional starting point** for ethics; morality requires the triune God as transcendental condition.
 - **Antithesis and common grace** held together: real ethical conflict with real shared civic life.
 - **Trinitarian grounding** of moral universals and particulars; avoids impersonal absolutes and sheer relativism.
 - **Covenantal framing** of law and gospel; Decalogue as treaty form, fulfilled in Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **autonomous natural law** and Thomistic nature-grace as granting ethics a neutral zone.
 - Against **neo-orthodox actualism** and situationism that dissolve stable norms.
 - Against **Kantian** autonomy and **utilitarian** calculus; insists on divine-command rooted in God's character without arbitrariness.
- **Conceptual innovations:**
 - **Theonomy** defined presuppositionally (God's revelation as ultimate norm), distinct from civil-penal theonomy debates.
 - **Analogical knowledge** applied to ethics; creaturely moral knowledge is dependent and covenantal.
 - **Borrowed capital** diagnosis of non-Christian moral coherence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Seedbed for later **Frame-Poythress** developments (norm-situation-existential perspectives).
 - Influential on **Bahnsen** while broader than civil legislation concerns.
 - Standard Reformed apologetic reference against ethical neutrality.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a **unified, triune, covenantal** account spanning dogmatics and ethics.
 - Trains readers to read moral philosophy **transcendentally** and pastorally, rooted in churchly practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theonomy (Van Til):** God's own self-revelation as the final ethical norm; contrasts:
 - **Autonomy:** Self-law of fallen reason.
 - **Heteronomy:** External compulsion without covenantal relation.
- **Antithesis:** Ethical-epistemic divide between believer and unbeliever; sharpened by regeneration, tempered by common grace.
- **Common grace:** Divine restraint and beneficence enabling shared cultural life without granting neutrality.
- **Point of contact:** Image of God and sensus divinitatis; activated rightly by the Spirit and Scripture, not autonomous reason.
- **Analogical knowledge:** Creaturely moral knowledge is dependent and similar-yet-different from God's; rejects univocity or equivocity.
- **Self-attesting Scripture:** The Spirit-witnessed, ultimate authority forming the normative perspective in ethics.
- **Ontological Trinity:** Self-contained absolute-personal God grounding moral unity and diversity.
- **Covenant:** Creator-creature relation structuring obligation; Decalogue as covenant charter.
- **Law and gospel:** Law expresses God's character; Christ fulfills and clarifies; third use guides sanctification.
- **Noetic effects of sin:** Fallenness corrupts moral reasoning, necessitating special revelation and regeneration.
- **Borrowed capital:** Inconsistent reliance on Christian assumptions within non-Christian ethics.
- **Transcendental argument:** Shows that moral norms presuppose the triune God and revelation.
- **Providence and situation:** God-governed contexts matter for application, under Scriptural norms and renewed persons.

- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - **Covenant theology:** Frames Decalogue and obedience within covenant lordship.
 - **Christology and soteriology:** Grounds ethics in Christ's obedience and the Spirit's sanctifying agency.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments:** Shapes moral formation through church discipline and means of grace.
 - **Anthropology and creation:** Defines image-bearing, fall, and cultural vocation under God's law.
