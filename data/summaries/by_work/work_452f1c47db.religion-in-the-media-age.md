### TITLE
Religion in the Media Age - Stewart M. Hoover

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st century intellectual milieu: rise of mass and digital media, debates about secularization/post-secularity, growth of popular religion studies and cultural studies of religion.
 - Interdisciplinary framing: media studies, sociology/anthropology of religion, cultural theory, practical theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Religion is fundamentally mediated**: contemporary religious authority, practice, identity, and experience are produced through media forms and institutions; media do not merely transmit religion but actively shape what counts as religious.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Theoretical framing: critiques institutional and text-centered models of religion; adopts media-ecological and cultural-studies perspectives to reconceive religion as a mediated cultural formation.
 - Empirical/analytic moves:
 - Map media technologies, genres, and industries that circulate religious meanings (TV, radio, film, print, digital).
 - Ethnographic attention to audiences and everyday practices: how people appropriate, bricolage, and domesticate mediated religious content.
 - Analyze institutional responses (churches, ministries, markets) and the emergent forms of authority and ritual shaped by media.
 - Evaluate implications for public religion, civic discourse, and theological categories (authority, revelation, community).
 - Methodological emphasis: mixed methods-textual/cultural analysis plus audience ethnography-foregrounding practice and interpretation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on media scholars and cultural theorists (cultural studies tradition), sociology of religion (critique of classical secularization), and ethnographic studies of everyday religion.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Berger, Habermas/public sphere debates, and mediatization literature; engages pastoral and practical theologians concerned with church response.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Not a systematic theology; treats doctrinally relevant themes via cultural analysis:
 - **Authority and revelation** (reconfigured by media mediation)
 - **Community and ecclesiology** (virtual/vernacular communities)
 - **Ritual and worship** (media-shaped liturgies and rites)
 - **Religious experience and identity** (consumerized, hybrid, bricolaged)
 - Indirect implications for Christology and soteriology insofar as mediations shape how salvific claims circulate and are received.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically, Hoover insists that modern media are not neutral channels but formative social actors; any adequate theology of religion must account for the mediating apparatuses that produce contemporary religious meanings, authority, and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Shifts focus from institutions and doctrines to **media practices and audience interpretations** as primary sites where religion is made and remade.
 - Emphasizes **vernacular, everyday religion** and the plural, negotiated character of belief in mediated environments.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Simple secularization narratives that treat media as agents of decline.
 - Institutional-centric models that locate religion only in churches or texts.
 - Narrow technological determinism-argues for attention to cultural contexts and human agency.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Promotes and synthesizes terms and lenses (see key terms) that make mediatization analytically central to religious studies and practical theology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in studies of digital religion, media and theology, pastoral theology, and public theology; influential beyond sociology into liturgical studies and missiology.
 - Critiques arise from those who see excessive culturalist readings or insufficient attention to doctrinal truth-claims and sacramental theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable empirical-methodological template: combine media analysis with ethnography to study religion's lived forms.
 - Serves as a bridge between academic media studies and theological reflection-useful for clergy, missiologists, and theologians addressing contemporary religious culture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mediated religion** - Religion as produced through media forms; emphasis on processes rather than static institutions.
- **Mediatization** - The social process through which media logics restructure religious practices and institutions.
- **Vernacular religion** - Everyday, informal religious practices and meanings shaped by domestic and popular media consumption.
- **Audience agency** - Viewers/listeners/users as active interpreters who appropriate, rework, and blend mediated religious resources.
- **Media ritual** - Ritual-like patterns and performances produced in and through media (e.g., televised worship, podcasts).
- **Bricolage** - The assembling of religious identities and practices from diverse mediated elements (consumer-spirituality, hybrid forms).
- **Public religion (reconfigured)** - Religious speech and presence in mediated public spheres; new modes of civic engagement and visibility.
- **Media ecology** - Attention to the whole media environment (technologies, industries, genres) shaping religion.
- **Authority shift** - Movement of credibility and legitimacy from institutional clerical centers toward media figures, networks, and platforms.
- **Consumer spirituality** - Religion as commodity and marketable identity produced through media industries.
- **Everyday religiosity** - Habitual, domestic religious practices mediated by everyday technologies.
- **Convergence culture** - Interaction of multiple media forms producing cross-platform religious phenomena.
- **Sacralization/desecularization (reinterpreted)** - Processes by which mediated forms can both desacralize institutional claims and generate new sacral spaces.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "mediated religion" and "vernacular religion" in courses on religion and media.
 - As a **polemic** against institutional-only models of religion and simplistic secularization narratives.
 - As a **methodological/exegetical model** for empirical study: combine media analysis with ethnography to assess contemporary religious formation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in practical theology and missiology to rethink authority, worship, and public engagement in media-saturated contexts.
