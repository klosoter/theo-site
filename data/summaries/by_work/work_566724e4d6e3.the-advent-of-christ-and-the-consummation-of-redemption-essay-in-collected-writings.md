### TITLE
**The Advent of Christ and the Consummation of Redemption** - John Murray (essay; Collected Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu (Murray at Westminster Theological Seminary). Reaction to liberal theology's attenuation of future eschatology and to dispensational/preterist distortions. Part of Murray's broader effort to press covenantal and Christological clarity in systematic eschatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The historical advent of Christ inaugurates redemption in such a way that its final consummation is certain, objective, bodily and cosmic; claims that fragmentary or privatized accounts of salvation fail to account for the inseparable link between Christ's person/work and the universal, future completion of redemption.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes biblical basis: texts emphasizing both present effect and future consummation (e.g., 1 Cor 15; Rom 8; Eph 1; Rev passages).
 - Argues for a covenantal and Christocentric unity: Christ's incarnation, atonement and ascension guarantee the reality and permanency of the believer's future redemption.
 - Distinguishes between the present application (subjective appropriation) and future completion (objective consummation) of redemption.
 - Affirms bodily resurrection and the renewal of creation as integral to consummation, rejecting purely spiritualized readings that deny material restoration.
 - Concludes with eschatological hope rooted in Christ's mediatorial reign and promised return.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Pauline corpus, Revelation), classical Reformed resources (Calvinic covenant theology), contemporary interlocution with liberal Protestantism and dispensational premillennialism; implicit conversation with theologians minimizing the cosmic scope of redemption.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and mediatorial work), soteriology (objective vs subjective aspects), resurrection, covenant of grace, new creation, final judgment, kingdom of God (inaugurated and consummated).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Christ's first advent secures an objectively promised consummation that is future, bodily and cosmic - the redemption inaugurated in history will be completed only at Christ's return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the objective nature of consummation: redemption is not merely existential appropriation but an eschatological event secured by Christ.
 - Explicit linking of individual salvation and cosmic renewal under one Christological horizon: personal sanctification and the restoration of creation belong to the same consummatory act.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies to spiritualize or domesticate eschatology into mere ethical progress.
 - Counters dispensational fragmentation that separates earthly/cosmic hopes from the one redemptive work of Christ.
 - Pushes back on pietistic privatization that reduces redemption to inner experience without bodily or cosmic dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precision in deploying "consummation" to mean the final, objective completion of redemption rooted in Christ's person and return.
 - Nuanced use of inaugurated/realized language while maintaining a robust future consummatory horizon.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly regarded in Reformed seminaries; used as a corrective model in systematic treatments of eschatology and soteriology.
 - Cited in debates over inaugurated eschatology and in defenses of covenantal continuity between present salvation and final restoration.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies theological categories used in contemporary eschatological debates (already-not-yet, objective/subjective redemption).
 - Provides a compact, scripturally grounded model linking Christology and cosmic eschatology suited for classroom and polemical use.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Advent of Christ:** The historical, incarnational coming that inaugurates the redemptive era.
- **Consummation (of redemption):** The final, objective completion of salvation - bodily resurrection, judgment, new creation - realized at Christ's return.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The doctrine that redemption has begun in Christ but awaits final consummation.
- **Already-not-yet:** Tension between present possession and future fulfillment of redemptive blessings.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological ground tying individual believers to the promise of future consummation.
- **Objective redemption:** The accomplished, objective status of Christ's work as securing future consummation (distinct from subjective appropriation).
- **Subjective application:** The believer's present, experiential appropriation of redemption (faith, sanctification) which does not exhaust consummation.
- **Resurrection body:** Emphasis on bodily resurrection as essential to consummation and denial of purely spiritual immortality.
- **New creation:** Cosmic renewal parallel to individual resurrection - integral to consummatory hope.
- **Final judgment:** Eschatological event that secures moral and cosmic justice as part of consummation.
- **Mediatorial reign:** Christ's present reign as guaranteeing the future consummatory act.
- **Covenant of grace:** The theological framework that unites promise, present application and future fulfillment.
- **Kingdom (inaugurated/consummated):** Kingdom understood as present in seed (Christ's rule) and future in fullness at consummation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for "consummation" in systematic theology courses and texts.
- As a polemic/resource against dispensational and liberal readings that divorce individual salvation from cosmic renewal.
- As an exegetical model for interpreting Pauline texts (1 Cor 15; Rom 8) that tie resurrection to creation-wide hope.
- As a conceptual pivot linking Christology, soteriology and eschatology in covenantal frameworks.
