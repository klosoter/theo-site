### TITLE
The Doctrine of Faith - Friedrich Schleiermacher (lectures and essays; core material in Der christliche Glaube, 1821/22)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant theology, Romantic piety and post‑Kantian philosophy (Schleiermacher 1768-1834). Work arises as synthesis reacting to Enlightenment rationalism and orthodox pietism; addresses the place of religion as a distinct form of human experience.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Faith is not primarily propositional assent but the immediate, affective consciousness of **absolute dependence** on God; systematic doctrine must interpret traditional dogmas (Trinity, Christology, creeds) as expressions of religious self‑consciousness rather than metaphysical invoices.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary anthropology: religion grounded in the feeling of absolute dependence (Gefuhl).
 - Revelation & mediation: God's self‑disclosure is realized in historical personhood, supremely in Christ (the perfect God‑consciousness).
 - Ecclesial and doctrinal expressions: Scripture and creeds are human articulations/witnesses to this religious feeling and Christ's mediation.
 - Trinitarian move: the Trinity understood relationally - Father, Son, Spirit as moments in divine self‑consciousness and communion, not as scholastic substance‑ontologies.
 - Practical theology: faith issues in piety and ecclesial life; doctrine must serve living religious consciousness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kantian critique of metaphysics, Romantic aesthetics, and contemporary dogmaticists; debates with orthodox confessionalism and implicitly with Latin scholastic formulations (e.g., debates surrounding the Filioque).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, faith (nature and knowledge), Christology (Christ as unique God‑consciousness), Trinity (relational/consciousness model), Scripture (witness rather than mechanical dictation), creeds (ecumenical formularies), church, justification/sanctification as functions of religious life.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's doctrine of faith centers theology on the living feeling of dependence mediated by Christ's God‑consciousness and reads creeds/doctrines as expressive, historical articulations that must be reinterpreted to serve religious self‑understanding.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology rooted in the **psychology of religious consciousness** (Gefuhl) rather than in metaphysical proofs or mere ethical norms.
 - Faith as **immediate, affective self‑consciousness** of God, with doctrines as reflective second‑order statements.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Enlightenment reductionism (which makes religion only moral assent) and orthodox scholasticism (which freezes dogma as metaphysical system).
 - Challenges unilateral confessional formulations (e.g., rigid readings of creeds, Latin scholasticism including the Filioque) by historicizing them.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts revelation, Trinity, and Christology in terms of **mediated consciousness** and personhood rather than substance metaphysics.
 - Introduces methodological priority of **religious experience** for doctrinal construction.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for 19th‑century liberal Protestantism and historical‑critical theology; intensely influential in modern theology, biblical hermeneutics, and theological education.
 - Criticized by confessionalists for subjectivizing doctrine; provoked Catholic and Protestant pushback on historic formulations (notably Trinitarian language).
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable hermeneutic for reading creeds ecumenically; supplies a pedagogical model that links doctrine to lived piety and theological anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence (Gefuhl der Abhängigkeit)** - the basic religious feeling that grounds faith; primary datum for theology.
- **Faith (Glaube)** - immediate, affective self‑consciousness of dependence; not reducible to propositional assent.
- **Revelation (Offenbarung)** - God's self‑disclosure realized in human consciousness and historical mediation (chiefly Christ).
- **Christ as God‑consciousness** - Christ embodies the perfect religious self‑consciousness that mediates God to humanity.
- **Trinity (relational model)** - Father, Son, Spirit interpreted as relational moments of divine self‑consciousness and communal life rather than static metaphysics.
 - Relation to Filioque: Schleiermacher historicizes the procession debate, treating the Filioque as a later, largely metaphysical insertion that misses the relational/experiential point.
- **Filioque** - criticized as symptomatic of scholastic metaphysical preoccupation; for Schleiermacher, the language should be reinterpreted to preserve relational, experiential meaning and ecumenical intelligibility.
- **Ecumenical creeds** - valued as historical, communal expressions of faith; authoritative in function but in need of reinterpretation to express living consciousness.
- **Scripture** - normative witness to revelation; not mechanical dictation but the church's record of God's self‑disclosure in religious life.
- **Dogma** - seen as theologized expression of religious life; must serve religious consciousness rather than dominate it.
- **Person (Person)** - emphasized as locus of mediation (Christ) and as category for understanding divine relations.
- **Justification / sanctification** - understood in relational and experiential terms within living faith.
- **Church** - communal locus where religious consciousness is formed and doctrines are articulated.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for liberal/protestant theology - defining faith in experiential terms and reframing doctrines.
- As a **polemic** against both rationalist and scholastic dogmatism - used to argue for theology grounded in experience.
- As an **exegetical / hermeneutical model** for reading creeds and Scripture historically and functionally rather than metaphysically.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching doctrinal loci by linking anthropology (consciousness) to Christology and Trinitarian theology.
