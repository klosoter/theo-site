### TITLE
One Assembly: Rethinking The Multisite And Multiservice Church Model - Jonathan Leeman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed pastoral context (9Marks network, mid-2010s).
 - Responds to the rise of megachurch multisite campuses and multiple weekly services in North American evangelicalism.
 - Pastoral-theological intervention aimed at pastors, elders, and church planters within conservative Protestant circles.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church's worship life ought to embody a single, visible gathered assembly; multisite and multiservice practices often fracture that unity and distort biblical ecclesiology.
 - Problem: pragmatic, consumer-driven scheduling and technological fixes (satellite preaching, staggered services) undermine the biblical picture of the gathered congregation, sacramental life, and eldership.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: the New Testament portrays the church as a gathered assembly that meets publicly and corporately (implications drawn from usage of ekklesia, Lord's Supper passages, and pastoral practice).
 - Normative claim: churches should aim for a single weekly gathering that manifests the one assembly of Christ.
 - Diagnostic critique: modern multisite/multiservice models fragment visible unity, complicate accountability, and reduce the Lord's Supper to logistical management.
 - Prescriptive guidance: where multiple services or sites are unavoidable, they must be structured to maintain corporate identity (shared membership, eldership oversight, common discipline, and sacramental integrity); avoid the technological substitution of preaching presence.
 - Practical helps: polity suggestions, pastoral priorities, and examples for churches wrestling with space and growth issues.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broad trends in evangelical megachurch practice and proponents of multisite expansion.
 - Converses implicitly with contemporary pastoral leaders and networks that promote satellite campuses and video preaching.
 - Draws on Reformed ecclesiological convictions and the 9Marks emphasis on church structure, eldership, and membership.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (gathered church, unity, membership).
 - Ministry and polity (eldership, accountability).
 - Sacramentology (Lord's Supper as corporate sign).
 - Worship theology (public, corporate worship as formative).
 - Implicitly touches covenant and church discipline.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - The church's chief public identity is its visible, singular assembly; pastoral fidelity requires structuring worship, polity, and sacraments to safeguard that one-ness above pragmatic convenience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Moves the debate from pragmatics to a canonical-normative claim: the *one assembly* is a theological norm, not merely an aesthetic preference.
 - Frames multisite/multiservice issues as ecclesiological and sacramental, not merely logistical.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects pragmatic multisite models that prioritize growth metrics, offering instead ecclesial and pastoral criteria.
 - Contrasts with defenders of video preaching and fully decentralized campus models by insisting on embodied eldership and shared membership.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-centers the phrase **one assembly** as a concise ecclesiological standard to evaluate modern Sunday practices.
 - Clarifies distinctions between a single church with multiple services and a federation of congregations under a shared brand.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Gained traction in Reformed/evangelical circles, especially among pastors attentive to eldership and membership.
 - Used as a rallying text for critics of uncritical multisite expansion; prompted conversations about sacramental integrity and pastoral presence.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful as a pastoral-theological case study linking biblical exegesis to church practice.
 - Serves as a principled checklist for elders deciding how to handle growth, space, and technology.
 - Provokes critical reflection on how worship practices form ecclesial identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One Assembly** - The book's central term: the gathered church should visibly manifest a single, unified congregation at worship.
- **Multisite church** - A church model with geographically separate campuses under one leadership/brand; critiqued for fragmenting visible unity.
- **Multiservice** - Multiple worship gatherings at different times on a Lord's Day; examined for effects on corporate identity and sacraments.
- **Eldership** - Pastoral oversight; Leeman insists elders must be present and functionally governing across any site or service.
- **Membership roll / corporate identity** - Shared membership is essential to maintain one assembly; cannot be merely programmatic.
- **Lord's Supper (Communion)** - Treated as emblematic of the problem: multiple services/campuses complicate a single eucharistic celebration and its theological meaning.
- **Video preaching / satellite sermon** - Technological substitute for pastoral presence; critiqued when it weakens relational eldership and accountability.
- **Sacramental integrity** - Concern that logistical solutions reduce sacraments to scheduling rather than covenantal sign acts.
- **Public worship** - Framed as formative for ecclesial life; not primarily consumer entertainment or recruitment tool.
- **Convenience-driven worship** - Pejorative term for scheduling/services aimed at consumer preferences rather than ecclesial formation.
- **Corporate discipline** - Discipline must operate within a unified membership; multi-site models risk diffusing accountability.
- **Federation vs. Single Church** - Analytical distinction: separate congregations in a federation differ from one church with many rooms.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a conservative ecclesiology that prioritizes visible unity in worship practice.
 - As a **polemic** against multisite and multiservice praxis that weakens sacramental and pastoral realities.
 - As a **practical polity model** informing elders and pastors on structuring services, membership, and sacramental oversight.
