### TITLE
**The Death of Death in the Death of Christ** (John Owen, 1647)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context.** Post-Dort Reformed orthodoxy in the English Civil War era; Puritan Independent milieu. Written against Remonstrant (Arminian), Amyraldian (hypothetical universalist), and Socinian proposals; engages contemporary English advocates of universal grace (e.g., Thomas More), and continental figures (Amyraut, Grotius).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem.** Christ died with a definite, effectual intent for the elect, actually procuring, not merely making possible, their salvation; hence in Christs death the death of death itself is secured.
- **Core argument / structure.**
 - **Nature, intent, extent.** The atonement is penal, substitutionary, and covenantal in nature; its divine intent is infallible salvation of the elect; its extent is coextensive with that intent.
 - **Priestly unity.** Christs oblation and intercession are inseparable; he intercedes for those for whom he offered himself, so the extent of the cross matches the scope of his heavenly advocacy (John 17; Heb 7, 9).
 - **Covenant of redemption.** The Father and the Son covenant for a definite people; the Son purchases all new-covenant blessings for them (faith, repentance, adoption, perseverance).
 - **Justice and double payment.** Gods justice cannot exact punishment twice; if Christ satisfied for a persons sins, that person cannot also bear them.
 - **Exegetical case.** John 10 (sheep), John 17 (those given), Eph 5 (church), Rom 8 (golden chain), Isa 53 (bearing of sins), Heb 9-10 (once-for-all sacrifice); clarification of world/all texts by context and usage.
 - **Sufficiency/efficiency.** The worth of Christs death is infinite (sufficient for all), but its design and application are for the elect alone (efficient for the many).
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors.** Scripture as norm; Augustine and Calvin; Reformed scholastics; Synod of Dort. Opponents include Arminius and the Remonstrants, Amyraut, Grotius, and English universalists (e.g., Thomas More).
- **Doctrines treated.** Atonement: necessity, nature, extent; Divine decrees: election and reprobation; Christology: active and passive obedience; Soteriology: regeneration/effectual calling and adoption as purchased benefits; Covenant theology (pactum salutis, new covenant); occasional implications for ecclesial application and sacramental debates.
- **Closing line.** The cross does not merely render sinners salvable; it secures salvation for the elect, harmonizing decree, redemption, and application in the triune work of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases.**
 - **Purchase of benefits.** Christ buys not only impersonal possibilities but the Spirit, faith, repentance, adoption, perseverance for particular persons.
 - **Intercession-oblation unity.** A priest both offers and intercedes for the same people; therefore extent follows intent.
 - **Trinitarian harmony.** No disjunction between the Fathers election, the Sons redemption, and the Spirits application.
- **Corrections / contrasts.**
 - Against **Arminian general redemption**, which makes salvation contingent on autonomous faith and weakens satisfaction.
 - Against **Amyraldian hypothetical universalism**, which posits universal intent but particular application, severing priestly acts.
 - Against **Grotian governmental theory** and **Socinian** denials of penal substitution, reaffirming satisfaction and imputation.
 - Clarifies **sufficiency vs efficiency** without granting a two-track divine intention.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves.**
 - The memorable trope **death of death**.
 - The **double payment** or double jeopardy argument in divine justice.
 - Tight definitions of redemption, reconciliation, propitiation as effectual acts, not conditional offers.
- **Reception and influence.**
 - Canonical statement of **definite atonement** in high Reformed orthodoxy; widely disseminated with J. I. Packers modern essay.
 - Continuously debated by four-point Calvinists; drawn upon in Baptist and Presbyterian discussions of covenant membership and sacramental efficacy.
- **Enduring value.**
 - Integrates decree, atonement, and ordo salutis with exegetical rigor.
 - Provides categories that stabilize assurance and pastoral proclamation: Christ saves whom he intends to save.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definite atonement / particular redemption.** Christs death is designed to save the elect infallibly.
- **Nature-intent-extent triad.** The atonements nature (penal substitution) entails an intent (to actually save) that fixes its extent (the elect).
- **Oblation and intercession coextensive.** Priestly offering and ongoing advocacy embrace the same persons.
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption).** Intra-trinitarian agreement securing a people and all their graces in Christ.
- **Penal substitution / satisfaction.** Christ bears the penalty due to his peoples sins, satisfying divine justice.
- **Double payment (double jeopardy).** Justice forbids punishing sin both in Christ and again in the sinner.
- **Active and passive obedience.** Christs lifelong obedience and death together procure righteousness and pardon for the elect.
- **Purchase of faith and adoption.** Faith, repentance, and adoption are bought by Christ and applied by the Spirit; they are not autonomous conditions.
- **Effectual calling / regeneration.** The Spirit applies what Christ purchased, ensuring the elects coming to faith.
- **New covenant procurement.** The blessings and people of the new covenant are secured by Christs blood, defining its beneficiaries.
- **Sufficiency vs efficiency.** Infinite intrinsic worth, with designed efficacy limited to the elect.
- **World / all language.** Read contextually (often qualitative or distributive), not as teaching universal atonement.
- **Decree: election and reprobation.** Redemption follows the decree; there is no cross-intent in God.
- **Means-end ordering.** God ordains both ends (salvation) and means (preaching, faith), all included in the purchase.
- **Adoption.** A central benefit secured at the cross and bestowed in union with Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Soteriology.** Definitional source on atonement extent; grounds effectual calling, regeneration, and adoption as purchased benefits.
 - **Christology.** Clarifies the unity of Christs active/passive obedience and the priestly nexus of sacrifice and intercession.
 - **Theology Proper.** Exhibits decree-redemption-application harmony in the triune will.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments.** Conceptual pivot in baptism debates (subjects and efficacy) via claims about the new covenants elect-defined scope.
