### TITLE
Modern Spirituality and the Reformation - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed academic milieu; article appears in Westminster Theological Journal and addresses contemporary Christian trends from a confessional Reformed perspective. Engages the historical Reformation and patristic debates as lenses for assessing "modern spirituality."
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Modern forms of spirituality often revive Pelagian or semi‑Pelagian emphases by privileging subjective experience and human initiative over the Reformation's insistence on God's sovereign grace and the objective Word‑promise; the remedy is a spirituality rooted in Reformation doctrine (scripture, covenant, justification by faith).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes what is meant by "modern spirituality" (experience‑centered, therapeutic, individualistic) and contrasts it with classical Reformation orientations.
 - Traces historical antecedents: parallels to Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies (human ability, cooperative initiation) versus Augustinian/Reformation emphases (total depravity, prevenient/sovereign grace).
 - Analyzes theological consequences: compromise of justification, confusion between assurance and feeling, weakening of covenantal promises and sacraments.
 - Proposes a Reformed corrective: a spirituality anchored in the objective promises of Scripture, the covenantal structure of salvation, and a doctrine of grace that secures both justification and sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (as the corrective to Pelagian trends), the Reformers (Luther and Calvin as exemplars), Pelagius and semi‑Pelagian positions as the negative foil; modern spiritual writers and movements (treated typologically rather than primarily by name) are critiqued for continuity with those older errors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Sin (total depravity), grace (prevenient and/or sovereign aspects), justification by faith, sanctification, covenant theology, Word and sacrament, authority of Scripture, the relation of experience to doctrine.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** A genuine Christian spirituality must be doctrinally anchored in the Reformation's covenantal and grace‑centered theology so that lived piety remains the faithful fruit of God's objective work in Christ rather than a reenactment of Pelagian self‑reliance or emotionalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats "modern spirituality" not merely as cultural phenomenon but as a theological syndrome that can be mapped onto historical heresies (Pelagianism, semi‑Pelagianism).
 - Stresses the primacy of the *objective* Word and covenant promises as the locus of spiritual life, not subjective feeling or autonomous moral striving.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects pietistic/experiential strands that underplay sin and grace by insisting on the Reformation's balance: genuine experience must be derivative from justification and promise, not antecedent to it.
 - Pushes back against theological positions that overemphasize human cooperation (semi‑Pelagian tendencies) by restating Augustinian/Reformation doctrines of dependence on divine initiative.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses an historical‑diagnostic method: diagnosing contemporary spirituality in terms of classical heresies to clarify underlying theological errors.
 - Frames "spirituality" as a doctrinally inflected practice rather than a neutral set of techniques or experiences.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for reinforcing confessional priorities in pastoral and spiritual formation.
 - Influential as a concise apologetic against experiential excesses in evangelicalism and charismatic movements, serving pastors and seminary courses.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact hermeneutic for assessing modern devotional trends through historical theology.
 - Serves as an organizing argument for integrating doctrine and devotion in catechesis and pastoral care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Modern spirituality:** Experience‑centered, therapeutic, and individualistic patterns of piety common in late modern Christian contexts; critiqued for doctrinal looseness.
- **Reformation theology:** Emphasis on sola Scriptura, sola fide, sola gratia, covenantal structure-presented as corrective to modern tendencies.
- **Pelagianism:** Ancient error asserting substantial human ability to initiate salvation; used as a historical analog for some modern spiritualities.
- **Semi‑Pelagianism:** A mid‑point error positing cooperative initiation between human will and divine grace; diagnostic category for many contemporary spiritual practices that presuppose human first‑step contribution.
- **Augustinianism:** The theological counterpoint emphasizing human depravity and divine initiative in salvation; foundation for Poythress's corrective.
- **Objective Word / Promise:** The idea that God's revealed Word and covenantal promises are the primary means of spiritual life and assurance, not subjective feelings.
- **Covenant theology:** Framework stressing God's promises and the corporate, sign‑mediated life of the church (sacraments, catechesis) as the context for spirituality.
- **Justification by faith:** Central doctrine connecting belief, assurance, and the ground for authentic spiritual life.
- **Sanctification:** Treated as the fruit and outworking of justification, requiring grace and doctrinal grounding to avoid moralism.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Serves as the normative corrective to experience‑based religion.
- **Experience vs. doctrine:** Contrasts experiential authenticity (derivative) with doctrinal primacy (constitutive).
- **Grace language:** Differentiates prevenient, sovereign, and cooperative schemes to expose modern deviations.
- **Pastoral application:** Implications for preaching, catechesis, sacramental practice, and spiritual formation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what constitutes Reformed spirituality versus modern experiential variants.
 - As a **polemic resource** to critique semi‑Pelagian and experiential movements in pastoral and academic debate.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** linking doctrinal teaching (justification, covenant) to practical spiritual formation in the church.
