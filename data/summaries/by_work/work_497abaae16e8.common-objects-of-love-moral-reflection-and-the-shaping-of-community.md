### TITLE
**Common Objects of Love: Moral Reflection and the Shaping of Community** - Oliver O'Donovan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Anglican/Reformed moral theology responding to modern moral philosophy (MacIntyre, Taylor) and to theological political questions. Addresses declining moral consensus in pluralist societies and the need for Christian public ethics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Moral reasoning is rooted in shared, public **objects of love**-the persons, practices, and institutions that shape communal attachments. Christian ethics must recover how these objects are named, ordered, and corrected within covenantal, ecclesial, and eschatological frameworks.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Moral perception depends on **object relations**: communities form habits and identify what is lovable.
 - Institutions mediate the ordering of loves; moral theology must attend to institutional forms (family, church, polity).
 - Sin deforms loves and objects; forgiveness and reconciliation (centered in Christ) reorient loves toward their proper ends.
 - Public moral reasoning requires theology that is both ecclesial and political-law, gospel, and common life are interdependent.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages biblical witness, Augustine, Reformers (esp. Calvinian themes), and contemporary moral philosophers (Alasdair MacIntyre, Charles Taylor).
 - Dialogues with liberal moral theory (autonomous individual), utilitarianism, Kantian deontology, and some versions of virtue ethics that neglect ecclesial/covenantal ground.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Christ as reconciling center that reorders loves), covenant (constitutive of communal identity), ecclesiology (church as formative community), revelation and law/gospel distinction, eschatology (regulative horizon for moral life), political theology (church/state boundaries and obligations).
- **Site usage across named topics**
 - **Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective:** supplies an eschatological grammar-ethical orientation shaped by Christ's reign and future consummation.
 - **Church And Kingdom:** articulates how the church forms kingdomly love-orders without collapsing into political triumphalism.
 - **Church And State Relations:** provides resources for balancing prophetic critique and institutional cooperation, emphasizing covenantal mediation of public responsibilities.
- **Closing line**
 - Christian moral formation is the communal cultivation of rightly ordered loves, corrected by Christ and lived out through covenantal institutions toward eschatological renewal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Puts **objects** (what is loved) rather than only virtues or rules at the center of moral theology.
 - Stresses institutional mediation: moral formation is public and structural, not merely private or individualistic.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern moral individualism and abstraction (utility, duty) by insisting on historically rooted communal practices.
 - Distinguishes itself from some virtue ethics by grounding moral goods in covenantal revelation and Christ's reconciling act, not merely tradition or narrative coherence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"common objects of love"** functions as both analytic tool and pastoral program-identifying what communities are taught to love and why.
 - Emphasizes **ordering of loves** as a doctrinally rich way to talk about sin, repentance, and reform.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and Anglican circles for Christian ethics and political theology; influential among scholars treating the public role of the church.
 - Used in debates over church-state boundaries, Christian engagement in civil society, and the role of eschatology in ethics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable framework for teaching ethics that connects doctrine (Christ, covenant, eschatology) with sociopolitical praxis and institutional theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES

- **Institutional mediation** - the idea that law, liturgy, family, polity, and church shape loves and moral habits.
- **Structural sin** - communal and institutional deformations of love that require public repentance and reform.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for covenantal moral formation and the grammar of loves.
