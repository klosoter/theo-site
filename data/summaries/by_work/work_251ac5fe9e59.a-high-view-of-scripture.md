### TITLE
A High View of Scripture? - Craig D. Allert

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical milieu grappling with canonical criticism, historical-critical methods, and debates over inerrancy and inspiration.
 - Situated for seminary readership: seeks traction between confessional commitments and critical scholarship.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Allert asks what it means to hold a genuinely **"high view" of Scripture** without collapsing that posture into simplistic formulations of inerrancy or anti-critical fideism.
 - The problem: how to preserve Scripture's normative authority for faith and life while honestly engaging historical-critical tools and contemporary hermeneutical concerns.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical survey of how "high view" has been articulated in evangelicalism (confessional/polemical lineage).
 - Critique of reductionist inerrancy models that treat Scripture as a mere repository of propositional facts or as immune to historical investigation.
 - Positive proposal: a relational, ecclesial, and canonical account of authority that:
 - Anchors inspiration in the incarnational shape of revelation (Scripture as witness to Christ rather than a self-sufficient epistemic foundation).
 - Affirms trustworthy truthfulness (sufficient reliability for salvation and doctrine) while allowing for disciplined critical inquiry where appropriate.
 - Recommends methodological humility and ecclesial interpretive practices.
 - Practical implications for preaching, teaching, and doctrinal formulation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Conservative and classical inerrantist voices (e.g., Warfield, later evangelical defenders like Packer/Geisler) are set against:
 - Canonical and theological critics (e.g., Brevard Childs-style canonical criticism, broader historical-critical scholars).
 - Contemporary voices advocating theological interpretation of Scripture.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, authority and canon, hermeneutics, ecclesiology (interpretive community), implications for Christology and soteriology.

- **Closing line**
 - Allert's theological center: a **"high view" of Scripture is an ecclesially mediated, christologically oriented authority-robustly confessional yet responsibly critical-rather than an absolutized, methodologically insulated doctrine.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Reframes "high view" as a lived ecclesial posture (interpretive practice) rather than merely a propositional thesis about textual perfection.
 - Stresses the primacy of Scripture's witness to Christ as the decisive locus of its authority.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against both:
 - Rigid inerrancy that resists all critical engagement and produces defensive apologetics.
 - Liberal or purely critical approaches that reduce Scripture to historical artifacts with only derivative theological value.
 - Offers a middle path that preserves doctrinal seriousness and critical integrity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocation of an **"ecclesial hermeneutic"**-authority constituted through the church's reception and reading of Scripture.
 - Distinguishes between **devotional high view** (piety and reverence) and **doctrinal high view** (authoritative normativity).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Moderately influential in seminary debates and evangelical scholarship seeking rapprochement with critical methods.
 - Used as a pedagogical corrective in courses on doctrine of Scripture and hermeneutics; cited in discussions reconstructing evangelical commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies terminological confusions about "high view" and offers a supple model useful for theological formation, pastoral practice, and constructive engagement with modern scholarship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **High view of Scripture**
 - Broad posture of reverence and authority; Allert redefines it as ecclesial, christologically-centered authority.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Treated critically when absolutized; defended where it protects normative truthfulness for doctrine and salvation.
- **Infallibility**
 - Emphasized as theologically serviceable when linked to salvific and doctrinal aims rather than every peripheral historical datum.
- **Inspiration**
 - Understood relationally: God's self-disclosure mediated through human witness shaped by the Spirit.
- **Authority**
 - Ecclesial and canonical: Scripture's authority is enacted in the believing community's reception and obedience.
- **Canon / canonical criticism**
 - Central method: the canon functions as the theological matrix for interpretation, not merely a historical collection.
- **Ecclesial hermeneutic**
 - Interpretive model prioritizing communal, liturgical, and confessional reading practices.
- **Historical-critical method**
 - Recognized as a tool to inform reading, but to be disciplined by theological commitments and devotional ends.
- **Christological center**
 - Scripture's primary function is to witness to Christ; hermeneutics is ordered toward this telos.
- **Devotional vs doctrinal high view**
 - Distinction clarifying piety-driven esteem from creedal, normative claims about Scripture's nature.
- **Methodological humility**
 - A virtue Allert urges for theologians and pastors engaging difficult textual or historical questions.
- **Sufficiency & perspicuity**
 - Retained in qualified form: Scripture is sufficient for faith and life; clarity is mediated by community and Spirit-guided interpretation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** to clarify what counts as a "high view" of Scripture in contemporary evangelical theology.
 - As a **polemic** against absolutist inerrancy and against reductionist critical readings.
 - As an **exegetical/epistemological model** advocating canonical, ecclesial reading habits for preaching and doctrine.
