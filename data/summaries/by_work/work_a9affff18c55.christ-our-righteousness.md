### TITLE
Christ, Our Righteousness - Mark A. Seifrid

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical New Testament scholarship engaging the New Perspective on Paul and the long Reformation/Protestant debate over justification. Written for scholars and advanced students, it aims to situate Pauline language about righteousness within both exegetical and systematic-theological frames.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's language of "righteousness" (and the verb "to justify") centrally names **Christ himself and his saving work** as the believer's righteousness. Justification is grounded not merely in human faith or covenant membership but in **Christ's person, obedience, suffering, and vindication**, appropriated by believers in union with him.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Lexical-historical survey of δικαιοσύνη / δικαιόω across Scripture and Second Temple literature to establish semantic range.
 - Exegetical focal readings of Pauline loci (esp. Romans chs. 1-5; Galatians) showing Paul's use ties righteousness-language to Christ.
 - Theological synthesis arguing for a model that integrates **forensic declaration (imputation)** and **participation/union with Christ**, where Christ's righteousness is both the ground of divine declaration and the believer's share by union.
 - Polemical engagement with the New Perspective (e.g., Sanders, Dunn, Wright) and with modern reductions that either secularize or unduly ethicalize Paul's dikaiosyne.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classic Reformers (Luther, Calvin), recent Reformation interpreters (Owen, Murray), New Perspective proponents (E. P. Sanders, J. D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright), contemporary exegetes (Moo, Cranfield), and Second Temple/Septuagint material.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, soteriology (justification and sanctification), imputation (active/passive obedience), union with Christ, covenant theology, forensic vs. participatory aspects of justification.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Paul presents Christ - his obedience, suffering, vindication, and righteousness - as the decisive ground and content of believers' justification; to be declared righteous is to be accounted within Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Makes **Christ-as-righteousness** the central hermeneutical key to Pauline dikaiosyne, rather than viewing righteousness mainly as status or ethical standing abstracted from Christ's person.
 - Careful attempt to hold together **forensic imputation** and **real participation**: imputation is not a cold juridical fiction but rests on the believer's real union with the righteous Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against New Perspective readings that locate righteousness primarily as covenant faithfulness or Jewish badge, arguing they underread Christological force in Paul.
 - Modifies some classic imputation-only accounts by insisting that Pauline language also commits to objective ontological sharing (union) with Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the semantic priority of Christ as subject/agent of righteousness-language in Paul; reframes dikaiosyne as relationally anchored in Christ rather than exclusively as abstract legal status.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise exegetical defense of traditional justification doctrine that engages the New Perspective respectfully.
 - Valued by pastors and scholars for bridging Pauline exegesis and systematic implications without collapsing one into the other.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, textually informed model for teaching justification that preserves both forensic and participatory dimensions.
 - Serves as a clear, scholarly corrective to readings that marginalize Christ's person and work in Pauline righteousness-talk.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dikaiosyne (righteousness):** Central Pauline noun; Seifrid reads it as often naming **Christ's own righteousness** which becomes the believer's by union and imputation.
- **Dikaiō (to justify):** Forensic declaration grounded in Christ's obedient and redemptive work; not mere moral approval but legal acquittal based on Christ.
- **Imputation:** The accounting of Christ's obedience and/or righteousness to believers; affirmed as real and legally efficacious but explained in unional terms.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's life of perfect law-keeping; a ground for righteousness accounted to believers.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death; included in what makes Christ the believer's righteousness and the object of divine vindication.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological basis for appropriation; the way believers are "in Christ" and thus share in his righteousness.
- **Forensic declaration:** God's legal pronouncement of righteousness; retained as essential but interpreted in light of union.
- **Participation (christification):** Believers' real sharing in Christ's status and life; balances forensic language without eliminating it.
- **Covenant(s):** Framework for understanding relational and legal dimensions of God's dealings; used to critique over-social readings of righteousness.
- **Vindication/eschatological vindication:** God's public affirmation of Christ's righteousness (and by union, the believer's) in resurrection/eschaton.
- **Substitution:** Christ bearing penalty and being the representative righteous one; undergirds imputation and union.
- **Righteousness of God:** Ambiguous Pauline phrase; Seifrid argues for a Christocentric reading that includes God's saving act in Christ.
- **Second Temple background:** Helps locate Pauline vocabulary but cannot displace Christological center.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for teaching the relation of Christology and justification (seminary lectures; systematic summaries).
 - As a **polemic** resource against New Perspective reductions and purely sociocultural readings of Paul.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating lexical, syntactical, and theological readings of Paul.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed soteriology to hold forensic imputation and unional participation together.
