### TITLE
Thomas Reid and the Story of Epistemology (2001) - Nicholas Wolterstorff

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century recovery of Enlightenment epistemology; Wolterstorff writes as a Reformed Christian philosopher-historian addressing both historians of philosophy and contemporary epistemologists. Focuses on the Scottish Enlightenment and Reid's mid-18th-century response to Locke, Berkeley, and especially Hume.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reid offers a sustained alternative to the "way of ideas" and philosophical scepticism by grounding knowledge in our natural, reliable cognitive faculties and common-sense principles; Wolterstorff argues Reid's approach is historically pivotal and philosophically fertile for thinking about knowledge of God and religious belief.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reconstructs the intellectual genealogy: Cartesian representationalism -> Lockean ideas -> Humean scepticism -> Reidian common-sense realism.
 - Presents Reid's critique of the "way of ideas" and his positive theory: direct realism in perception, the distinction between perception and judgment, and a doctrine of principles (innate natural beliefs).
 - Examines Reid's account of specific faculties: perception, memory, consciousness, testimony, conscience, and induction, showing how each resists sceptical dissolution.
 - Connects Reid's epistemology to theological concerns: the rationality of belief in God, the credibility of testimony (including Scripture), and the interpretive role of conscience.
 - Concludes with Reid's legacy: how his framework set the stage for later epistemological and theological developments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, David Hume, Kant (as a responder), contemporaneous Scottish thinkers, later epistemologists (notably Plantinga and McDowell by inheritance).
- **Doctrines treated:** Epistemology broadly; more specific treatments of revelation and testimony (as epistemic routes), conscience (moral/theological knowledge), and natural theology (grounds for belief in God).
- **Closing line:** Wolterstorff presents Reid as a remedial epistemologist whose common-sense realism restores the credibility of ordinary belief (including theistic belief) by trusting well-ordered cognitive faculties against Cartesian/Lockean sceptical currents.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents Reid as not merely a common-sense apologist but as systematic: detailed faculty psychology and argument against the representational model.
 - Stresses Reid's constructive program-positive epistemic principles implanted by nature-rather than mere conservative appeal to intuition.
- **Corrections or contrasts:** 
 - Corrects the caricature of Reid as anti-theoretical by showing the internal structure and argumentative force of his system.
 - Contrasts Reid's direct realism with the representationalist line from Descartes/Locke and with Humean scepticism about causation and induction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies Reid's distinction between perception (immediate acquaintance) and judgment (reflective assent), and the role of "principles" (not quite innate ideas, but natural warrants).
 - Recasts Reid's "common sense" as an epistemic theory rather than merely pragmatic prudence.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Reinforced interest in Scottish Realism among contemporary epistemologists and philosophers of religion; informs strands of Reformed epistemology while remaining historically grounded.
 - Read widely by historians of philosophy, theologians worried about scepticism, and philosophers exploring the rationality of religious belief.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Supplies a historically rich alternative to modern internalist and reliabilist accounts; useful as a bridge between historical scholarship and current debates about the epistemic status of religious belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common sense:** For Reid, a body of natural principles that guide belief formation; Wolterstorff treats it as an epistemic foundation against scepticism.
- **Direct realism:** Perceptual objects are known directly, not via ideas or representations; central Reidian corrective to the "veil of perception."
- **Way of ideas:** The representational model (Descartes/Locke) that Reid rejects as the source of sceptical paradoxes.
- **Principles (natural principles):** Non-inferential beliefs implanted by nature (e.g., existence of the external world, reliability of memory); function as epistemic defaults.
- **Faculty psychology:** Reid's taxonomy of cognitive powers (perception, memory, conscience, testimony); Wolterstorff emphasizes its systematic role in grounding knowledge.
- **Perception vs. judgment:** A critical Reidian distinction-perception = immediate awareness; judgment = reflective assent-which blocks sceptical regress.
- **Testimony:** Social epistemic source; Reid defends the prima facie credibility of testimony, relevant to how Scripture/religious claims are received.
- **Conscience:** Treated by Reid as a faculty that yields moral/theological knowledge; Wolterstorff highlights its theological import for knowing God's claims.
- **Memory:** Presented as a reliable faculty whose outputs are prima facie justified unless undermined; key to diachronic epistemic stability.
- **Induction and causation:** Reid offers common-sense grounds for trusting causal inference against Humean scepticism.
- **Natural theology:** Reidian epistemology supplies a framework within which belief in God can be rationally basic or properly grounded.
- **Scottish Realism:** Label for Reid's school; Wolterstorff situates it as both historically and theologically significant.
- **Epistemic warrant (Reidian sense):** Trust in properly functioning faculties yielding justified belief; anticipatory of later debates in warrant.
- **Credibility principle:** The default acceptance of ordinary beliefs unless there are specific defeaters.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "common-sense epistemology" and direct realism in lecture and seminar contexts.
- As a **polemic resource** against sceptical or purely representational accounts of perception and religious knowledge.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** for reading the Enlightenment's interaction with Christian theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary discussions about the rationality of religious belief and the role of faculties (feeding into Reformed epistemology and wider epistemology).
