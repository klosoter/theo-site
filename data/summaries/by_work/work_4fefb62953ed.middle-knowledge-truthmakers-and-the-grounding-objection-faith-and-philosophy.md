### TITLE
Middle Knowledge, Truth-Makers, and the "Grounding Objection" - William Lane Craig (Faith and Philosophy)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theology venue (Faith and Philosophy). Craig writes as a leading modern Molinist within analytic philosophy of religion; intervenes in a renewed debate over Molinism, possible-worlds semantics, and metaphysical grounding of counterfactuals.
 - Milieu: late 20th-early 21st century Anglo‑American discussion about divine foreknowledge, libertarian freedom, and truth‑makers for modal/evaluative claims.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Craig defends Molinism's middle knowledge against the "grounding objection": the claim that counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs) lack non‑divine truth‑makers prior to God's creative decree, thereby undermining middle knowledge as genuine knowledge.
 - He argues that this objection fails: there are plausible accounts of truth‑making for CCFs (or that God himself can be the legitimate ground) that preserve both genuine libertarian freedom and robust divine foreknowledge/providence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Molinist scheme: distinctions among natural, middle, and free knowledge; role of CCFs in God's providential choice.
 - Presentation of the grounding objection: why critics think CCFs cannot have truth‑makers independent of God's decree (the alleged "truth‑maker gap").
 - Survey of possible responses and Craig's positive proposals:
 - **Possible‑worlds/factive grounding**: CCFs are grounded in facts about agents in relevant possible worlds (dispositions, character traits, probabilistic tendencies).
 - **Agent‑internal dispositional grounding**: intrinsic properties of agents in those worlds serve as truth‑makers for CCFs.
 - **Divine grounding**: God's knowledge or God's creative will may legitimately be the ultimate ground without vicious circularity.
 - Rebuttal of common variants of the objection that presuppose an implausibly strict truth‑maker requirement or misconstrue the metaphysics of possible worlds.
 - Application to theological loci: how a defensible middle knowledge sustains a theodical framework and accounts of providence without fatalism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Luis de Molina (historical origin of middle knowledge), contemporary Molinists (e.g., Plantinga's possible‑world machinery compared), and modern critics of Molinism (the "grounding objection" literature).
 - Philosophical resources: truth‑maker theorists, possible‑world semantics, analytic metaphysics of dispositions and properties.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine foreknowledge, Providence, Human libertarian freedom, Theodicy (Problem of Evil) in so far as Molinism supplies a providential explanatory framework.

- **Closing line**
 - Craig's paper defends the intelligibility and metaphysical viability of middle knowledge by showing the grounding objection rests on disputable metaphysical assumptions; properly understood, Molinism continues to offer a coherent reconciliation of divine foreknowledge, providence, and libertarian freedom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Marries analytic possible‑world semantics with truth‑maker concerns rather than treating the latter as fatal to Molinism.
 - Stresses the permissibility of grounding CCFs in possible‑world facts or in God without collapsing freedom into determinism.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Counters critics who assume truth‑makers must be actual‑world entities or insist that only creaturely acts in the actual world can ground modal truth.
 - Pushes back on anti‑Molinists who treat middle knowledge as epistemically ad hoc or metaphysically vacuous.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the taxonomy of grounding options (possible‑world facts; agent dispositions; divine grounding) and redefines the fault line as metaphysical not theological.
 - Refines the notion of what counts as a satisfactory truth‑maker for counterfactuals about non‑actual situations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among Molinists and sympathetic analytic theologians as a concise rebuttal to the grounding objection.
 - Provoked further technical work on dispositions, modal metaphysics, and on whether God can be a non‑question‑begging truth‑maker.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, accessible defense of middle knowledge suitable for seminary/philosophy courses.
 - Serves as a productive pivot for subsequent, more technical treatments of modal truth‑makers and divine knowledge.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle Knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (what free creatures would do in hypothetical circumstances).
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom (CCFs)** - Statements like "If S were in circumstance C, S would freely do action A."
- **Grounding Objection** - The critique that CCFs lack non‑divine truth‑makers prior to God's creative decree, so middle knowledge is ungrounded.
- **Truth‑maker** - An entity/fact that makes a proposition true; the debate concerns what can make modal/counterfactual propositions true.
- **Possible Worlds** - Semantic/metaphysical tools used to locate truth‑makers for CCFs in facts about agents in non‑actual worlds.
- **Disposition / Intrinsic Properties** - Proposed creaturely bases in possible worlds that can serve as truth‑makers for CCFs.
- **Divine Grounding (God as truth‑maker)** - The view that God's knowledge or decrees can legitimately ground the truth of CCFs without circularity.
- **Natural / Middle / Free Knowledge** - Molina's tripartite schema: God's knowledge of natural truths, middle (CCFs), and free (actual outcomes after creation).
- **Libertarian Freedom** - The freedom preserved by Molinism; actions are not necessitated by prior states or divine decree.
- **Foreknowledge vs Fatalism** - Concern about whether divine foreknowledge entails causal determinism or undermines freedom; Molinism seeks to avoid fatalism.
- **Truth‑maker Gap** - The alleged lacuna between modal propositions and available truth‑makers; Craig argues this gap is spurious.
- **Metaphysical Priority** - Who/what ultimately grounds modal truths - creaturely properties, possible worlds, or God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and defense** of middle knowledge against metaphysical objections (standard reference for courses on divine knowledge).
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with anti‑Molinists about foreknowledge, providence, and theodicy.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies workable truth‑maker options that allow theologians to deploy Molinism in analytic treatments of Providence and the Problem of Evil.
