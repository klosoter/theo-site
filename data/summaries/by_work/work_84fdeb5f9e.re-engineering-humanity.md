### TITLE
Re-Engineering Humanity - Brett M. Frischmann and Evan Selinger (2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the late 2010s amid rapid deployment of AI, ubiquitous computing, platform economies, and attention-extracting business models.
 - Interdisciplinary milieu: law, philosophy, behavioral economics, technology studies; responds to debates sparked by Thaler & Sunstein (nudging), Zuboff (surveillance capitalism), and work on persuasive technology.
 - Secular, policy-oriented audience with implications for public theology and ecclesial ethics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Contemporary socio-technical systems are actively "re-engineering" human behavior and capacities. This engineered shaping threatens autonomy, dignity, epistemic integrity, and human flourishing unless checked by law, institutional design, and moral-political resistance.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: empirical description of how algorithms, platforms, choice architectures, and corporate incentives systematically shape behavior (surveillance, rewards, personalized persuasion).
 - Mechanisms: persuasive technologies, nudges, default settings, feedback loops, attention-harvesting, opaque algorithmic ranking.
 - Harms: loss of autonomy/agency, erosion of moral responsibility, epistemic harms (misinformation, filter bubbles), social and civic fragmentation, commodification of attention and behavior.
 - Normative frame: defends a robust account of human agency and dignity as a social-legal value that requires institutional protection.
 - Remedies: regulatory interventions (transparency, constraints on data markets), design alternatives (human-centered architecture), public norms, and collective governance of technological infrastructures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages behavioral economists (Thaler & Sunstein), persuasive tech (BJ Fogg), surveillance capitalism (Shoshana Zuboff), legal scholars and technologists; draws on empirical studies in psychology, HCI, and platform studies.
 - Implicit interlocutors include techno-optimists, libertarian paternalists, and laissez-faire regulators.

- **Doctrines treated (theologically relevant)**
 - Anthropology: implicit theory of human vulnerability, plasticity, and moral agency.
 - Ethics: autonomy, responsibility, dignity, and the common good.
 - Political theology: public goods, institutional stewardship, and governance.
 - Not explicitly doctrinal on revelation, Trinity, or Christology, but directly relevant to doctrines of the imago Dei, vocation, and formation.

- **Closing line**
 - A secular but sharp manifesto arguing that protecting human agency and dignity against systems that optimize behavior is a pressing legal, ethical, and theological task.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on systemic and infrastructural design rather than only individual culpability; sees technological architecture as a collective moral actor.
 - Marries legal prescription with insights from behavioral science-moves beyond abstract moralizing to actionable institutional design.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Critiques libertarian paternalism for underestimating cumulative, opaque, and commercialized reshaping of desires and capacities.
 - Opposes techno-utopian faith in market self-regulation and in algorithmic neutrality.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"re-engineering humanity"** as diagnostic/heuristic: captures cumulative engineering of dispositions, attention, and decision-making.
 - Emphasizes **behavioral architecture** and **persuasive systems** as moral/ political phenomena.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited in tech-ethics, law & policy, and public theology circles as a compelling call to institutional reform.
 - Influential for scholars critiquing platform power and for advocates of human-centered design and regulatory oversight.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to theologians and ethicists who underplay technological formation.
 - Serves as a practical bridge between descriptive social-science and normative claims about human flourishing and institutional responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Re-engineering humanity**
 - The aggregate effect of technologies and institutions redesigning human behavior, capacities, and social relations.

- **Behavioral architecture / choice architecture**
 - The designed contexts (defaults, prompts, interfaces) that shape decision-making without explicit coercion.

- **Persuasive technology**
 - Tools and platforms intentionally built to influence attitudes and behaviors via feedback, rewards, or social proof.

- **Nudging / libertarian paternalism**
 - Soft influence techniques; book critiques the cumulative and commercialized deployment beyond benign 'nudges.'

- **Algorithmic governance**
 - Use of opaque algorithms to make or shape social and individual decisions; raises accountability and dignity concerns.

- **Surveillance capitalism (related)**
 - The commercial model of extracting behavioral data for prediction and modification; Frischmann & Selinger engage this as a key enabling condition.

- **Autonomy / agency**
 - Central normative category: capacity for reflective self-rule undermined by opaque persuasive systems.

- **Dignity / human flourishing**
 - Treated as social-legal ends that demand protection from commodifying architectures.

- **Epistemic harms**
 - Distortions of information environments that impair knowledge, deliberation, and moral responsibility.

- **Attention economy**
 - The commodification of human attention; a mechanism for behavioral shaping.

- **Design justice / human-centered design**
 - Alternative design principles proposed to preserve agency and public goods.

- **Regulatory pluralism**
 - Proposal for layered legal, design, and normative responses rather than single fixes.

- **Technological affordances**
 - How features of systems enable or constrain human action and formation.

- **Default settings**
 - Small design choices with outsized behavioral effects; ethically significant in aggregate.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "behavioral architecture" and "re-engineering" in ethics, law, and theology courses.
- As a **polemic** against techno-determinism and libertarian paternalism when arguing for institutional responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in public theology and ecclesial ethics for thinking about formation, vocation, and the protection of human dignity in digital contexts.
