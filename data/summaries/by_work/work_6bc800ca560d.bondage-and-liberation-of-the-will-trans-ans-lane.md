### TITLE
Bondage and Liberation of the Will - John Calvin (trans. A. N. S. Lane)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation theology; Calvin writes within the Augustinian-Reformation debate on sin, grace, and human freedom. Intended to clarify and defend Reformed claims about human inability and divine sovereignty amid ongoing controversies sparked by Erasmus and later Arminian challenges.
- **Central thesis**
 - The human will is radically bound by sin and cannot turn to God or perform truly good spiritual acts without sovereign, effectual divine grace; true liberation is an act of God in Christ by the Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: sustained appeal to Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Ephesians, and John) and to Augustine to show moral inability and need for regeneration.
 - Anthropological claim: the will is not neutral but enslaved to sin (bondage = entrenched concupiscence and moral incapacity).
 - Theological solution: grace is both necessary and efficacious - prevenient in the sense that it precedes any turning, but decisive and effectual in accomplishing faith and repentance.
 - Pastoral and soteriological consequences: justification, sanctification, and election are united to the work of sovereign grace; means (Word and sacraments) are vehicles of effectual calling.
 - Polemic moves: refutation of Pelagian/ semi-Pelagian optimism about unaided will and rebuttal of any salvation scheme that diminishes God's initiative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Augustine (primary patristic authority), Pauline corpus, contemporary opponents of strict grace doctrines (echoes of Erasmus and later Arminian positions); tacit conversation with Luther on bondage but with Calvinian juridical and pastoral forms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (depth and universality), free will (moral inability), grace (prevenient/effectual), predestination/election, justification by faith, regeneration, union with Christ, means of grace.
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin centers salvation on God's sovereign, effectual grace: human will is captive to sin and only liberated by Christ through the Spirit, received in the Word and sacraments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong compatibilist account: human responsibility preserved even as will is described as morally incapable without grace; freedom conceived as the will rightly ordered by grace rather than neutral spontaneity.
 - Stress on union with Christ as the locus of liberation - not merely a forensic declaration but a real transformative union effected by the Spirit.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Pelagian optimism: insists that merit or initial consenting power in fallen humans is illusory.
 - Nuanced relative to Luther: Calvin systematizes bondage within his broader doctrines of justification, sanctification, and ecclesial means, giving a more pastoral/institutional shape.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies "bondage" as a theological-psychological condition (enslavement to sin) rather than simple determinism; frames grace as both initiating and effecting faith (anticipating later discussions on "efficacious" or "irresistible" grace).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Reformed articulations of total depravity and irresistible/efficacious grace; frequent source in polemics against Arminianism and influential in Reformed scholastic formulations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, scripturally rooted model of anthropological sin and divine initiative that remains a staple in Reformed systematic theology, pastoral ministry, and debates over freedom and responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Bondage (servitus / enslavement)** - the will's captivity to sinful nature; not annihilation but moral impotence.
- **Liberation (liberatio)** - deliverance by Christ and the Spirit enabling genuine spiritual choice and obedience.
- **Free Will (liberum arbitrium)** - redefined: fallen will cannot effect salvation; true freedom is restored freedom under grace.
- **Total depravity** - shorthand for pervasive corruption of all faculties, including the will, so no ability to will spiritual good unaided.
- **Effectual (efficacious) grace** - grace that accomplishes what it intends; it is both prevenient to and determinative of conversion.
- **Prevenient grace (in Calvinian sense)** - grace that precedes and awakens the will, yet understood as effectual in bringing about faith.
- **Election / predestination** - divine sovereign choice that grounds salvation; Calvin links election to the effectual operation of grace.
- **Regeneration / new birth** - immediate divine act that liberates the will and makes faith possible.
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological bond through which liberation, justification, and sanctification occur.
- **Means of grace** - Word and sacraments as instruments through which effectual calling and liberation commonly operate.
- **Moral responsibility** - retained as a biblical demand; Calvin rejects antinomian fatalism while denying unaided moral ability.
- **Scriptural exegesis** - Calvin's method: theological claims anchored in canonical texts, especially Romans and Ephesians.
- **Augustinian authority** - Augustine's anthropology and theology of grace are the decisive patristic resource.
- **Pastoral orientation** - doctrinal claims framed with concern for assurance, penitence, and the church's ministry.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: standard Reformed statement on human inability and effectual grace.
 - Polemic: lever against Pelagianism and later Arminian appeals to natural freedom.
 - Exegetical model: template for Pauline anthropology and doctrine of conversion in preaching and pastoral theology.
