### TITLE
**The Second Replie of Thomas Cartwright (1575)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late Elizabethan England (1575); part of the ongoing Puritan controversy over church government after the Elizabethan Settlement. Cartwright writes within the Reformed/Puritan movement, responding to defenders of episcopacy and conformity in the Church of England.
 - Public polemical climate: parliamentary petitions, ecclesiastical visitations, and pamphlet exchanges between Puritan ministers and Anglican apologists.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Cartwright defends a **presbyterian model of church government** as the only scripturally warranted form for the Christian church, and opposes episcopal hierarchy and state-imposed uniformity in ecclesiastical matters.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Scriptural exegesis: reads New Testament practice (Acts, Pauline epistles) to show early churches ruled by plural elders (presbyters) rather than monarchical bishops.
 - Historical argument: traces the development of hierarchy as a post-apostolic corruption or human imposition, not a divine ordinance.
 - Polemical refutation: answers contemporary defenders of episcopacy on points of terminology, jurisdiction, ordination, and the relation of church officers to civil magistrates.
 - Practical implications: articulates how offices, ordination, and church discipline should operate under presbyterial oversight and how disputes with civil authorities should be handled.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages broadly with Anglican episcopal apologists (contemporaries such as bishops and university theologians; later polemical exchanges would implicate figures like John Whitgift and Richard Hooker).
 - Draws on Scripture, Church Fathers selectively, and Reformed continental examples (Calvinist Geneva) for ecclesial practice.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Church government and offices** (presbyterate vs episcopate), **discipline**, authority of Scripture for polity, the relation of church and magistrate, ordination, and the nature of ministerial power.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Cartwright insists that legitimate church order is a collegial, scripturally grounded presbyterate that preserves the purity and discipline of the church against hierarchical and state-imposed innovations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on **parity of ministers** (no inherent superiority of bishops), and a robust institutional role for presbyteries and synods as exercising collective authority.
 - Emphasis on **discipline as central** to ecclesial health; discipline belongs primarily to the church's courts, not to civil magistrates.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Contrasts sharply with the Elizabethan compromise that upheld episcopal governance and liturgical uniformity; attacks the appeal to historical precedent used by episcopal apologists.
 - Challenges Anglican arguments that episcopacy is necessary for order, apostolic succession, or unity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Systematic use of the term **presbyterie** as a political-ecclesial unit; refined contrasts between "delegated" and "intrinsic" ministerial authority.
 - Clarifies distinctions among **session, presbytery, and synod** in English polemical vocabulary.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely read among English Puritans; helped to crystallize Presbyterian ecclesiology in England and later in Scotland and the Westminster tradition.
 - Met strong opposition from the Anglican hierarchy; contributed to Cartwright's marginalization but formed part of the intellectual backbone for later Presbyterian organization and the anti-episcopal case.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Valuable primary source for understanding Elizabethan Puritan polity, methods of Reformed ecclesiological argument, and the link between exegesis and institutional proposals.
 - Useful as a compact model of polemical theological method: scriptural proof-texting combined with historical critique and practical prescriptions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterian polity / presbyterie:** church rule by councils of elders; the central institutional proposal of the work.
- **Elder / presbyter:** ministerial office exercised collegially; principle of parity among ministers.
- **Episcopacy / bishop:** criticized as a hierarchical, non-scriptural office when claiming superiority or jurisdiction over presbyters.
- **Ordination:** sacramental/practical rite; Cartwright argues for ordination by collective presbytery rather than by a single bishop.
- **Church discipline:** corporate corrective practice belonging to church courts; guarded against civil usurpation.
- **Scriptural warrant:** Cartwright's hermeneutical standard-polity must be grounded in clear New Testament precedent.
- **Magistrate / civil authority:** limited role in ecclesiastical governance; may protect order but must not usurp spiritual discipline.
- **Session / presbytery / synod:** tiers of presbyterian courts with defined jurisdictions; organizational vocabulary emphasized.
- **Parity (of ministers):** theological assertion that ministers are equals in office without intrinsic hierarchical superiority.
- **Historical precedent:** used critically-early church practice preferred over medieval ecclesial development.
- **Uniformity / conformity:** opposed where it enforces rites or governance lacking scriptural warrant and conscience protection.
- **Delegated vs intrinsic authority:** distinguishes temporary delegation of functions from an office's inherent jurisdictional claim.
- **Reformed model (Geneva/Calvin):** exemplar invoked for practical implementation and precedent.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for early English Presbyterian polity and the vocabulary of elders/presbyteries.
- As a **polemic** against episcopacy in studies of Puritan-Anglican controversy.
- As a **model of exegetical-ecclesiological argument**, showing how Scripture and church history are marshaled for institutional claims.
