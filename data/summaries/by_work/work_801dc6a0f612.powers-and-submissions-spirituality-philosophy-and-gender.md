### TITLE
Powers and Submissions: Spirituality, Philosophy and Gender - Sarah Coakley

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Anglo-Catholic feminist theology in conversation with continental and analytic philosophy.
 - Responds to feminist critiques of ecclesial power, secular theories of subjectivity (power/knowledge), and a renewed interest in spiritual theology and ascetic practice.
- **Central thesis**
 - Theologies of gender and power must recover Christian spiritual disciplines-most centrally *submission* understood kenotically-as formative practices that reshape subjectivity, reconfigure power, and provide a theological alternative to both patriarchal domination and reductive secular critique.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnoses two failures: (1) feminist accounts that reduce change to political/legal reform or to cultural deconstruction; (2) ecclesial theologies that defend power without attending to formative spiritual practices.
 - Reclaims **asceticism** and **kenotic submission** as practices that transform desire, knowledge, and authority, yielding a non-dominating model of power rooted in Trinitarian love.
 - Develops a philosophically informed account of how spiritual formation affects epistemic status (how one knows and is known), ethical agency, and gendered relationships.
 - Argues for a theological anthropology of relational personhood (not atomistic autonomy) that is shaped by contemplative and communal practices.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with modern feminist theorists and secular philosophers of power (critical theory and post-structuralist strands), feminist theologians, and classical Christian sources (patristic and monastic traditions).
 - Dialogues across disciplines: spiritual writers/mystics, systematic theology (Trinity/Christology), and analytic/conceptual philosophy of personhood.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (perichoresis and kenotic relations as paradigms of non-coercive power)
 - **Christology** (kenosis as model for ethically transformative power)
 - **Anthropology** (relational personhood; formation of desire)
 - **Spiritual theology** (asceticism, contemplation, submission as practices)
 - **Ecclesiology and authority** (how power operates within church structures)
- **Closing line**
 - Coakley locates the theological center of gravity in a recovered spirituality of kenotic submission: practices that reconfigure power through Trinitarian patterns of love, thereby offering a robust theological resource for thinking gender, authority, and subjectivity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats asceticism and submission not as passive resignation but as active, formative practices that create new epistemic and affective capacities.
 - Moves beyond binary "power = domination / power = agency" by proposing **transformative, non-coercive power** rooted in kenosis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects secular feminist readings that treat power purely as structural or discursive; opposes ecclesial defenses that ignore spiritual formation and the ethical cost of power.
 - Contrasts with radical autonomy models by emphasizing dependence, vulnerability, and communal formation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Deployment of **submission (pluralized)** as a theological category with ritual, epistemic, and ethical dimensions.
 - Articulation of an **ascetic-epistemology**: how disciplined spiritual practice shapes knowing and moral perception.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among contemporary feminist theologians, Anglican and academic circles; sparked renewed interest in spiritual theology within feminist debates.
 - Provoked critique from those wary of recuperating "submission" language amid histories of gendered abuse; generated careful debate about power, consent, and ecclesial practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable bridge between spirituality and systematic theology; useful for teaching on ethics, ecclesiology, and feminist theological method.
 - Models responsible interdisciplinary theology: philosophically literate, historically grounded, and pastorally sensitive.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Submission(s)** - plural to signal varied, formative practices; not mere subordination but relational openness and self-giving shaped by kenosis.
- **Power(s)** - reframed beyond domination; includes transformative, non-coercive power modeled by Christ and the Trinity.
- **Kenosis** - central Christological paradigm; normative pattern for ethical and ecclesial power.
- **Asceticism / spiritual disciplines** - practices (fasting, prayer, communal rule) that re-form desire, attention, and knowledge.
- **Ascetic-epistemology** - the claim that spiritual disciplines produce distinctive epistemic capacities and moral perception.
- **Trinity / perichoresis** - intra-divine relationality as the theological model for non-violent, mutual power.
- **Relational personhood** - anthropology emphasizing dependence, vulnerability, and mutuality over individualist autonomy.
- **Sexual difference / gender** - theological category read through spiritual formation; resists reduction to pure social construction or essentialist schemas.
- **Epistemic humility** - cultivated disposition that counters epistemic domination and enables shared discernment.
- **Ecclesial authority** - rethought in light of kenosis and submission; authority as service and formation, not mere hierarchy.
- **Contemplation / mysticism** - sources for ethical transformation and alternative epistemic modes.
- **Power-as-formation** - concept capturing how power operates through practices that form persons and communities.
- **Submission-as-practice vs. submission-as-status** - crucial analytic distinction Coakley insists on.
- **Philosophical theology** - her method: disciplined philosophical engagement to clarify theological claims about power and subjectivity.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "submission" and "ascetic-epistemology" in theological ethics and spiritual theology.
 - As a **polemic** against both patriarchal theology and reductive secular feminism-used to argue for recovered religious practices.
 - As an **exegetical/formation model** in ecclesiology and pastoral theology, informing debates about authority, ordination, and gendered ministry.
