### TITLE
The Life of Jesus - Friedrich Schleiermacher (posthumous edition; early 19th‑century German Protestant theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century German theology and Romantic intellectual life; reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, Kantian critical philosophy, and developing historical‑critical Biblical scholarship.
 - Schleiermacher (1768-1834); Life of Jesus circulated near the end of his career and completes his constructive theologizing begun in Reden and The Christian Faith. It fed directly into the nascent "Lives of Jesus" research program (e.g., Strauss).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reconstructives a historically credible portrait of Jesus by foregrounding **Jesus' unique religious consciousness** rather than metaphysical definitions of person‑and‑natures. The core theological problem: how to account for Jesus as the paradigmatic human revelation of God without recourse to speculative metaphysics that disconnect doctrine from religious experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: empathic, historical reconstruction grounded in the New Testament narratives, privileging the synoptic material while read through the lens of religious feeling.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Jesus' **God‑consciousness** (Gottesbewußtsein) as the decisive datum: an inward certainty and sense of divine presence that shapes his mission.
 - Read miracles, parables, and actions as expressions of that consciousness and as means of forming the community of disciples.
 - Treat the Kingdom of God as an ethical‑religious community, actualized by Jesus' life and calling followers into shared feeling and practice.
 - Reinterpret sacraments and church life as vehicles for continued communal experience rather than metaphysical channels.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament Gospels critically; reads against rationalist reductionism and metaphysical orthodoxy. Implicit and explicit interlocutors: Kantian and post‑Kantian philosophers, Enlightenment critics, contemporaries in German theology (Strauss later reacts polemically).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), revelation (experiential model), incarnation (reoriented toward consciousness rather than metaphysical union), atonement (ethical/relational emphasis), ecclesiology and sacraments (church as community of feeling), Kingdom of God (ethical‑communal realization).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Schleiermacher centers theology on **Jesus as the supreme witness of God in human consciousness**: theology becomes the articulation of that religious feeling embodied and transmitted in community.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **religious feeling ("feeling of absolute dependence")** as the primary locus of revelation over propositional dogma or metaphysical categories.
 - Christology grounded in the development and expression of Jesus' inner God‑awareness rather than in ontological formulations about two natures.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves away from scholastic metaphysics and substitutionary/forensic accounts of atonement toward an ethical, exemplary, and relational account.
 - Challenges confessional literalism and mechanistic miracle‑explanations without denying the religious significance of Gospel narratives.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized the technical use of **Gottesbewußtsein** (God‑consciousness) as a theological category and advanced an empathic historical method for reconstructing Jesus' life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for liberal Protestant theology and modern historical‑critical Jesus research; influenced Ritschl, Harnack, and nineteenth‑century biblical scholarship.
 - Provoked conservative backlash and later corrective movements (notably Barthian neo‑orthodoxy) that accused Schleiermacher of reducing revelation to subjectivity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined historical method combined with constructive theology; valuable for teaching Christology, hermeneutics, and ecclesiology where experiential and communal dimensions are central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God‑consciousness (Gottesbewußtsein)** - Jesus' inward awareness of divine presence; primary datum for Schleiermacher's Christology.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - the fundamental religious feeling that grounds revelation and ethical life.
- **Empathic historical method (Verstehen)** - reconstructive approach to Gospel material emphasizing the psychology and conviction of Jesus.
- **Kingdom of God** - realized ethic‑community formed by Jesus' life; socioreligious realization rather than an abstract future metaphysical realm.
- **Miracles as expressive acts** - interpreted as meaningful manifestations of Jesus' consciousness and mission, not primarily as proof texts for metaphysical claims.
- **Atonement (ethical/relational)** - salvation framed as transformation through participation in Jesus' life and community, not primarily penal substitution.
- **Church as community of feeling** - ecclesiology emphasizes communal cultivation of religious feeling; sacraments function as memorials and communal forms rather than ontological channels of grace.
- **Lord's Supper / Presence** - presence of Christ understood experientially and communally rather than metaphysically; eucharist as solidarity in shared consciousness.
- **Kenosis (critique/placement)** - Schleiermacher does not adopt classical kenotic metaphysics; instead he interprets self‑emptying in terms of Jesus' fully realized dependence on God.
- **Messianic consciousness** - Jesus' subjective awareness of vocation and kingdom mission; central to his authority and teaching.
- **Covenant of Redemption (secondary use)** - Schleiermacher seldom frames his account in classical covenantal terms; modern readers may map his relational language onto covenant motifs.
- **Church government / Presbyterian polity (applied use)** - Schleiermacher's stress on communal formation has been used to critique rigid office‑centric polities and to argue for organizational forms that foster common religious life.
- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for liberal, experience‑centered Christology and theological method.
 - As a **polemic and exegetical model** against metaphysical, substitutionary, or strictly forensic accounts of Jesus, sacraments, and church.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for studies linking hermeneutics, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology to the sociology and psychology of religious formation.
