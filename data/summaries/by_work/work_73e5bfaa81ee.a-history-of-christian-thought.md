### TITLE
A History of Christian Thought - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Protestant theological milieu; Tillich writes as a leading figure of continental Protestant liberalism with existentialist and phenomenological influences. Work appears late in his career and functions as both survey and methodological manifesto responding to modernity, historicism, and neo-orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian thought must be read as a historical, dynamic set of responses to fundamental existential questions; theology is the correlation between human existential concerns and the Christian message understood in symbolic, ontological categories.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces major periods (Patristic, Medieval, Reformation, Modern) and thematic loci (God, Christ, Trinity, sin, salvation, eschatology, Spirit) while constantly applying the **correlation method**: theology interprets revelation in the language of contemporary existential questions.
 - Major moves:
 - Recover how Christian doctrines arose as answers to concrete existential and cultural problems.
 - Show continuity of theological motifs through reformulations rather than unbroken dogmatic identity.
 - Advocate symbolic and ontological reinterpretation of classical doctrines for modern thought.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Augustine, Athanasius, Anselm, Aquinas, Luther, Calvin, Schleiermacher, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Ritschl, Barth, Bultmann; uses patristic texts, scholastic synthesis, Reformation confessions, and modern philosophical sources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity, Christology, sin and anthropology, soteriology, eschatology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, sacraments; sustained attention to **Christology** and **Trinitarian** formulations given site usage profile.
- **Closing line**
 - Tillich situates theology as a living, interpretive discipline: doctrines are historically conditioned symbolic answers to the human predicament, centered on the God who is the "Ground of Being" and the claim that ultimate concern finds its fulfilment in the Christ-event.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Theology as **correlation** between existential questions and revelation; God as **Ground of Being** (being-itself), not a supreme being among beings.
 - Prioritizes symbolic, not propositional, language for divine realities; doctrines point beyond themselves to existential transformation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects 19th-century liberal reductionism (e.g., Schleiermacher) by reasserting transcendence and objective dimension of revelation.
 - Critiques neo-orthodoxy (e.g., Barth) for rejecting correlation and for an overly propositional, anti-cultural stance; seeks a middle path that avoids both relativism and fundamentalism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Ultimate concern", "Ground of Being", and the consistent use of existential-ontological categories to reconstruct doctrines historically.
 - Recasts classical Christological and Trinitarian language in ontological and symbolic registers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in mainline Protestant theology, theological education, and pastoral theology; shaped mid-20th-century dialogues on faith and culture.
 - Criticized by conservative and evangelical theologians for perceived subjectivizing of revelation and by some systematicians for underplaying propositional truth-claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a pedagogical model for reading doctrinal history as a living conversation; valuable for Christology and Trinity studies that seek philosophically informed reinterpretation and for ecumenical reflection across eras.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ultimate concern**
 - Religion defined as what claims the totality of a person's ultimate loyalty; the pivot for correlating human condition and divine disclosure.
- **Correlation (method)**
 - The methodological bridge: existential questions <-> theological answers; structures historical-theological analysis throughout the work.
- **Ground of Being / Being-itself**
 - Ontological characterization of God that reframes classical theism for existential and philosophical audiences.
- **Symbolic language**
 - Doctrine as symbolic expression that both reveals and veils divine truth; resists purely literal readings.
- **Depth-dimension**
 - Emphasis on existential depths of sin, alienation, and redemption beyond moralistic schemas.
- **Existential questions**
 - Anxiety, meaning, guilt, death, freedom - the human concerns theology responds to in each historical stage.
- **New being / Christ-event**
 - Christ as the decisive event instituting a qualitative transformation of being, read existentially and ontologically.
- **Trinity (relational ontology)**
 - Trinitarian doctrines interpreted to show relational and ontological dynamics of being rather than only metaphysical substance-talk.
- **Demythologizing (contrast)**
 - Tillich's approach differs from Bultmann: he reinterprets symbols ontologically rather than stripping them of existential content.
- **Modernity / Culture**
 - Culture is both source of questions and arena for theological articulation; theology must translate gospel into contemporary idiom.
- **Reception terms: neo-orthodoxy / liberalism**
 - Work functions as corrective to both currents; used as a touchstone in debates about theological method.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for modern theological method (correlation) and for defining contemporary liberal-existential theology.
- **Polemic tool** against both fundamentalist literalism and anti-cultural neo-orthodoxy; cited in debates on Christ's divinity and revelation.
- **Exegetical and conceptual pivot** in Christology and Trinity studies: provides a model for reinterpreting classical doctrines in ontological-symbolic terms.
