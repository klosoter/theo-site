### TITLE
Presuppositional Apologetics - John M. Frame (chapter in Five Views on Apologetics, 2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetics dialogue; placed inside a multi-author volume contrasting major apologetic approaches.
 - Milieu: post-Enlightenment epistemological fragmentation, rise of evidentialism, reformed responses (Van Til), and increased attention to worldview apologetics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Apologetics must begin with and presuppose the truthfulness of the Christian revelation; non-Christian worldviews cannot provide the necessary preconditions for intelligibility.
 - Problem addressed: how to justify Christian truth-claims in the face of claims to neutral evidence or "common ground."

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opening move: critique of neutrality - there is no viewpoint-free common ground; every argument rests on presuppositions.
 - Transcendental turn: show that only the Christian God makes possible logic, morals, and science (a variant of the Transcendental Argument for God).
 - Scripture and epistemology: Scripture is the ultimate norm - its authority is both **cognitive** (provides true propositions) and **existential** (the Holy Spirit bears witness to its truth).
 - Practical method: place apologetics under theology - apologetics is a theological discipline (see Theological Method: Principia Theology As Science).
 - Theology functions as a rational science founded on scriptural principia rather than autonomous philosophical starting points.
 - Polemical strategy: expose the incoherence or insufficiency of rival worldviews and defend the coherence and explanatory power of the Christian worldview.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with classical and evidential apologetical positions (representatives of classical evidentialism and natural theology).
 - Implicit and explicit engagement with Cornelius Van Til (shared presuppositional roots), but with Frame's distinctive emphases.
 - Appeals to scriptural doctrine, philosophical categories (logic, ontology), and epistemological considerations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, self-attestation).
 - Epistemology: knowledge, presuppositions, the role of the Holy Spirit (internal testimony).
 - Doctrine of God as the grounding of intelligibility.
 - Antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought; implications for ethics and natural science.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame argues that apologetics is properly a theological enterprise: start with Scripture as principia and demonstrate that the Christian worldview uniquely secures the preconditions of rational life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Integration of apologetics into systematic theology - apologetics as theology "done scientifically" from scriptural principia.
 - Emphasis on **self-attesting** Scripture combined with rational critique of non-Christian worldviews.
 - Use of a broadly Van Tillian transcendental argument but interpreted through Frame's multiperspectival sociology of knowledge.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Unlike strict evidentialists, disputes the legitimacy of neutral facts as decisive apart from worldview interpretation.
 - Differs from some Van Tillian formulations by allowing more explicit use of classical proofs when subordinated to presuppositional commitments.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing apologetics in terms of "principia" and "theology as science" - stressing methodical normativity rather than mere polemic.
 - Multiperspectival language (normative, situational, existential perspectives) applied to apologetic method.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; serves as a standard, accessible articulation of presuppositionalism for a broader audience.
 - Sparked continued exchanges with evidentialists and reformed epistemologists; used in seminary pedagogy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies links between doctrine of Scripture and apologetic method.
 - Provokes sustained reflection on starting points, neutrality, and how theology constrains reason - valuable for teaching worldview apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - method that begins with Christian revelation as the necessary grounding for rationality.
- **Transcendental argument (TAG)** - shows that non-Christian worldviews cannot account for the preconditions of intelligible experience.
- **Principia / Theology as science** - theology grounded in scriptural principia; apologetics functions within this systematic framework (see Theological Method: Principia Theology As Science).
- **Self-attesting (self-authenticating) Scripture** - Scripture's authority is ultimately established by God's self-revelation and the Spirit's internal witness (see Self Attestation And Authority Of Scripture).
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit** - experiential, epistemic warrant by which Scripture commends itself to believers.
- **Antithesis** - radical opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought; no neutral vantage.
- **Multiperspectivalism** - threefold perspective (normative, situational, existential) used to analyze knowledge and apologetic claims.
- **Common ground critique** - rejection of the notion of neutral evidential starting points.
- **Ultimate authority** - Scripture functions as the final normative standard for truth and reason.
- **Worldview coherence/explanatory power** - criteria used to test rival systems.
- **Epistemic circularity (reclaimed)** - Frame argues that certain circularity (Scripture tested by Scripture and Spirit) is epistemically legitimate, not vicious.
- **Rationality as creaturely** - reason is a God-created capacity whose norms reflect divine character.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for presuppositional apologetics and the principia model of theological method.
- As a **polemic and exegetical model** for defending Scripture's authority and the self-attestation thesis in epistemology and systematic theology.
