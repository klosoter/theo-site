### TITLE
**From Sabbath to Lord's Day** 
Author: **D. A. Carson** 
Concise theological study tracing the biblical, historical, and theological trajectory by which the Israelite Sabbath motif becomes the Christian Lord's Day, with implications for worship, law, and ecclesial practice.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship addressing worship practice, Sabbath theology, and the relations between Old Covenant institutions and New Covenant practice; interaction with Reformed/Sabbatarian debates and patristic scholarship.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The Sabbath motif (creation rest, covenant sign, eschatological rest) is retained in principle in Christian worship but is not simply transplanted intact as a seventh-day legal institution; the Christian Lord's Day (first day) reinterprets and fulfills Sabbath realities in light of Christ's resurrection and the new covenant.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Exegetical survey of Old Testament Sabbath theology: creation, Sinai/law, sabbatical rhythms, typology of rest and covenant. 
 - New Testament reassessment: resurrection as inaugurating "first day" worship, New Testament absence of explicit command to keep seventh-day Sabbath, instances of Christian gatherings on the first day (e.g., Acts, 1 Cor 16, Rev 1). 
 - Patristic and historical development: early church testimonies (Justin, Ignatius, Justin Martyr) show first-day observance as primary; discussion of continuity and adaptation in late antiquity and medieval practice. 
 - Theological synthesis: moral/practical continuity (rest, holiness, worship), ceremonial discontinuity (day, exact legal form). Practical implications for Christian worship and Christian liberty.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Major engagement with biblical texts (OT Sabbath passages; NT texts on resurrection and first-day worship), patristic witnesses (Justin Martyr, Ignatius), Reformers (e.g., Calvin), later Puritan and Reformed sabbatarian proponents, and contemporary Sabbatarian critics.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation and biblical theology (continuity/discontinuity) 
 - Covenant and typology (Sabbath as sign and foreshadowing) 
 - Christology (resurrection as decisive) 
 - Ecclesiology and worship (Lord's Day practice) 
 - Law and gospel (moral law vs. ceremonial observance) 
 - Eschatology (rest as inaugurated and consummated)

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 The Sabbath principle persists as a Christ-centered pattern of divine rest and worship, but the Lord's Day reframes that pattern around the resurrection: continuity of purpose, discontinuity of precise form.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Clear insistence on both continuity and discontinuity: moral/typological continuity with OT Sabbath, but a decisive Christological reorientation to the first day. 
 - Strong focus on resurrection as the hermeneutical key that transforms Sabbath meaning into Lord's Day observance.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushback against strict seventh-day Sabbatarianism that reads the OT Sabbath command as carrying unchanged into Christian obligation. 
 - Corrects careless assertions that Sunday observance is merely a Roman imposition; traces early Christian theological reasons for first-day worship.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Frames the shift as a typological fulfillment rather than simple abolition or mere transfer - emphasizes "principle over ordinance" without collapsing into antinomianism.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles as a balanced corrective to legalistic and neglectful positions alike. 
 - Adopted in pastoral and academic discussions on the Lord's Day; influential in confessional-era Sabbath debates and contemporary worship formation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models disciplined biblical-theological method across Testaments and historical sources. 
 - Serves as a compact, readable briefing for pastors, students, and denominations wrestling with Sunday observance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sabbath:** OT seventh-day rest; creation ordinance, covenant sign, typological pointer to eschatological rest. 
- **Lord's Day:** Christian first-day observance centered on Christ's resurrection; locus for gathered worship and Eucharistic celebration. 
- **Continuity/Discontinuity:** The hermeneutical framework Carson uses to judge which Sabbath elements persist and which are reconfigured. 
- **Typology:** Reading OT Sabbath as a type fulfilled in Christ and the Christian practice of the Lord's Day. 
- **Resurrection as Hermeneutic:** The interpretive key that shifts the center from seventh-day cessation to first-day celebration. 
- **Moral vs. Ceremonial Law:** Distinguishes enduring moral principles (rest, worship) from changing ceremonial forms (specific day observance). 
- **Worship/Eucharist:** The Lord's Day as the normative occasion for corporate worship and sacramental life in early Christian practice. 
- **Patristic Witness:** Use of early church fathers (Justin Martyr, Ignatius) to show theological-not only cultural-reasons for first-day observance. 
- **Covenantal Fulfillment:** Sabbath seen as part of covenant history fulfilled in Christ and the new covenant community. 
- **Eschatological Rest:** The forward-looking dimension of Sabbath fulfilled in consummation yet inaugurated in Christ. 
- **Christian Liberty:** Balance between respectful observance of Lord's Day practices and refusal to reduce them to legalistic obligation. 
- **Historical Development:** Traces how practice became normative in the early church and later codified in Western Christianity.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for describing how Sabbath theology becomes the Lord's Day in Reformed teaching. 
- As a **polemic** resource in debates with seventh-day Sabbatarians and against both legalism and Sabbath neglect. 
- As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating biblical-theological method linking OT ordinance to NT fulfillment and patristic reception.
