### TITLE
**The Christ's Faith: A Dogmatic Account - Michael Allen**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed dogmatic retrieval and constructive theology; written within a broadly evangelical/Reformed milieu seeking to recover orthodox emphases on Christ's humanity, obedience, and covenantal mediation.
 - Responds to late 20th-21st century debates about the nature of Jesus' human subjectivity (knowledge, will, affectivity) and the doctrinal consequences for soteriology and imputation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The faith of Christ is a genuine, human, covenantal trusting of the Father that is constitutive for his mediatorial obedience and saving work. A proper dogmatic account must locate this faith in the human nature of the Son while explaining its relation to the divine person and to justification and imputation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological survey: traces how patristic, medieval, and Reformed orthodox authors spoke of Christ's faith and its role in mediation.
 - Christological foundation: establishes that the human nature of the Son is the proper locus (subject) of faith, without collapsing the distinction of natures in the one person.
 - Exegetical-theological demonstration: reads key biblical texts to show Jesus' trustworthy dependence on the Father (prayer, obedience, promise-fulfillment).
 - Soteriological implications: argues that Christ's faith functions instrumentally in his obedience and that it is central to theology of imputation, union, and justification.
 - Systematic consolidation: integrates the account with Trinitarian, covenantal, and sacramental concerns, answering major objections about divine impassibility, exemplarism, and reductionism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture and creedal tradition as primary authorities.
 - Broad engagement with patristic and medieval witnesses and with Reformation/Reformed orthodox treatments.
 - Dialogues with contemporary systematic and historical theologians over the person-nature relation, the subject of faith, and the notion of active/passive obedience.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and natures; human subjectivity)
 - Soteriology (active & passive obedience; atonement)
 - Union with Christ and federal headship
 - Imputation (of Christ's righteousness and of believers' guilt)
 - Trinitarian relations as they bear on mediatorial faith

- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center of gravity: *Christ's human faith is the indispensable, active nexus by which the incarnate Son fulfills covenantal demands and secures salvation for his people; a clear account of that faith reshapes Christology and soteriology together.*

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insists on faith as an active, trusting obedience in the human nature of Christ, not merely a cognitive assent or an effectless exemplar.
 - Frames Christ's faith within covenantal language: faith as the means by which the Mediator assents to and fulfills the Father's promises and demands.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects views that either deny the genuineness of Christ's human trust (reducing it to a divine attribute) or that render it merely exemplary for believers.
 - Pushes back against accounts that divorce Christ's internal trust from the objective merit required for imputation and justification.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the notion of the "ontological subject" of Christ's faith: the human nature as acted upon within the one person, avoiding both Nestorian and monophysite tendencies in pastoral vocabulary.
 - Develops a nuanced distinction between faith-as-instrument and faith-as-exemplar within covenantal theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Prompted renewed discussion in Reformed academic circles about the role of Christ's subjective life in objective atonement.
 - Used increasingly in seminary courses on Christology and soteriology as a corrective to reductionist accounts.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a disciplined model for integrating biblical exegesis, historical theology, and dogmatic construction on a contested topic.
 - Serves as a clear resource for pastors and teachers wrestling with how to preach and catechize regarding Jesus' human trust and obedience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ's faith** - Human, covenantal trust of the incarnate Son directed to the Father; central saving action.
- **Active obedience** - The works of life and trust by which Christ fulfilled God's law; here identified as faith-shaped obedience.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and death; held in relation to his faithful trust.
- **Hypostatic union** - Doctrinal frame for locating faith in the human nature while preserving the unity of the person.
- **Ontological subject of faith** - The human nature as the proper bearer of trusting acts within the one person of the Son.
- **Federal/headship language** - Christ as covenantal representative whose faith-and-obedience accrues to the elect.
- **Imputation** - Transfer of Christ's righteousness (grounded in his faithful obedience) to believers; faith functions instrumentally for the Mediator.
- **Covenant of grace/works interface** - How Christ's faith fulfills covenantal demands and secures promised benefits.
- **Faith as instrument vs. exemplar** - Distinguishes the mediatorial, justificatory function of Christ's faith from merely providing a moral example.
- **Trinitarian relations** - The filial pattern of Christ's trust within intra-Trinitarian economy.
- **Mediatorial office** - The office in which Christ's faith operates to achieve redemption.
- **Subjectivity and passibility** - Treatment of Jesus' human emotions, will, and trust in orthodox bounds.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional resource in Christology for locating acts of faith within the human nature of the Son.
 - As a polemical resource against exemplarist and reductionist accounts of Christ's internal life.
 - As an exegetical-model for reading New Testament texts that portray Jesus' trust and dependence.
 - As a conceptual pivot in debates over imputation, justification, and the role of Christ's obedience in covenant theology.
