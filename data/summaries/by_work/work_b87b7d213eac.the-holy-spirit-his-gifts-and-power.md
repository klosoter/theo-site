### TITLE
The Holy Spirit: His Gifts and Power - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan theology; post-Civil War, during Reformed scholastic consolidation. Owen writes within the Puritan pastoral-intellectual milieu confronting sectarian enthusiasm (Quakers, Seekers), Arminian challenges, and debates about extraordinary gifts and assurance.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the personal, sovereign agent who effects faith and repentance, sustains sanctification, and dispenses gifts - while extraordinary, apostolic gifts served foundational purposes and must be distinguished from abiding graces.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: The person and essential properties of the Spirit - unity with the Trinity, deity, personal agency.
 - Part II: The Spirit as efficient cause of regeneration - He produces faith and repentance in the elect (faith and repentance as gifts, not merely human acts).
 - Part III: The Spirit in sanctification - mortification, progressive holiness, assurance of salvation through internal witness.
 - Part IV: Gifts and offices - careful taxonomy of extraordinary vs ordinary gifts; purpose of miraculous gifts in apostolic era vs normative church life.
 - Part V: Pastoral implications - proper use of means (preaching, sacraments), critique of enthusiasm, guidance for assurance and church order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed authorities: Augustine and Calvin as primary precedents; engages contemporary ministers and critics (notably the "enthusiasts"/Quakers and more broadly, Arminian-leaning debates).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (pneumatology within trinitarian framework), Christology (Spirit's work tied to Christ's mediation), soteriology (regeneration, faith, repentance), sanctification, ecclesiology (gifts and office), revelation/authority (role of Spirit in Scripture and preaching).
- **Closing line**
 - Owen centers pneumatology: the Spirit is the sovereign power producing faith and repentance, ordering the church by means and gifts, and securing continual sanctification and assurance for believers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that **faith and repentance are immediate gifts of the Spirit** - not purely human decisions - grounding pastoral assurance in divine agency.
 - Strong focus on **mortification** as primary fruit of the Spirit's power; sanctification is central, not peripheral.
 - Nuanced distinction between **foundational miraculous gifts** (apostolic, temporary) and **permanent graces** for the believer and church.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against enthusiasts: rejects inner, untested revelations as ecclesial norm and curbs claims that present miracles authenticate teachers.
 - Against reductive voluntarism or Pelagian tendencies: rebukes any account that locates initiation of faith/repentance in human will apart from Spirit.
 - Tempered critique of excessive cessationism: acknowledges extraordinary operations historically but confines their normative function.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Precise operational language distinguishing **efficient operations** (what Spirit does sovereignly) from **instrumental means** (preaching, sacraments).
 - Clear working taxonomy: **gifts** (charismata) vs **graces** (habits/virtues); **extraordinary** vs **ordinary** operations.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in later Reformed and Puritan pastoral theology; foundational for doctrines of assurance and sanctification in Presbyterian and Congregational traditions.
 - Cited by both cessationist and non-cessationist advocates - often marshalled to argue for orderly skepticism of modern charismatic claims while affirming Spirit-centered piety.
- **Enduring value**
 - Rich resource for pastors and theologians on the interrelation of Spirit-work, sanctification, and ecclesial order; exemplary model of careful theological discrimination combined with pastoral concern.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Faith** - presented as a gift wrought by the Spirit; intellectual assent united to trust produced in regeneration.
- **Repentance** - Spirit-produced turning from sin; often treated as inseparable from true faith.
- **Regeneration** - sovereign new birth; ontological change enabling faith and repentance.
- **Sanctification / Mortification** - the Spirit's ongoing work of putting sin to death and forming Christlike habits.
- **Assurance / Witness of the Spirit** - inward testimony that grounds believers' confidence in salvation.
- **Illumination** - Spirit's role in opening Scripture and conscience; distinct from propositional revelation.
- **Gifts (charismata)** - varied empowerments; Owen distinguishes:
 - **Extraordinary gifts**: tongues, prophecy, miracles - historically foundational.
 - **Ordinary gifts**: preaching, pastoral gifting - ongoing for church life.
- **Means (ordinary)** - preaching, sacraments as Spirit-ordained instruments, not substitutes for his internal operation.
- **Union with Christ** - relational ground for Spirit's indwelling and application of redemption.
- **Operations / Efficient cause** - technical language for how the Spirit exerts personal agency in conversion and sanctification.
- **Gift vs Grace** - "gift" often refers to discrete empowerments; "grace" to habitual sanctifying presence.
- **Enthusiasm** - pejorative term for unauthorised inner revelations; Owen's target in pastoral correction.
- **Apostolic foundation** - role of miraculous gifts in establishing the church's doctrine and authority.
- **Indwelling / Adoption** - Spirit as guarantee and seal of the believer's new status.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source for the Spirit's role in conversion (soteriology/pneumatology).
 - Polemical resource against enthusiasm and ecclesial disorder (ecclesiology/pastoral theology).
 - Exegetical-pastoral model for grounding assurance and progressive sanctification (practical theology).
