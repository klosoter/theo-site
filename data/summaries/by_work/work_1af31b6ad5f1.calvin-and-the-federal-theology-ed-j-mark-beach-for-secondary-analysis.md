### TITLE
Calvin and the Federal Theology (ed. J. Mark Beach) - concise secondary-analysis notes on Calvin's covenant thought and its reception in modern covenant debates

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early/mid 16th century Reformation context (Calvin's Institutes and commentaries); the edited volume gathers Calvinian texts and modern essays (Beach) to treat Calvin as a primary source for Reformed "federal" or covenant theology.
 - Milieu: response to scholastic late-medieval soteriology, polemic against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and parts of Lutheran theology; later reception in 20th-21st century Reformed debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin articulates a covenantal framework centered on Christ as federal head and mediator: salvation and corporate identity are structured by covenants (works/grace tension, promise/fulfillment, union with Christ).
 - The modern problem: how to read Calvin for contemporary controversies (e.g., Federal Vision monocovenantalism; Klinean covenant-historical ethics).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition: Calvin employs covenant language to relate law and gospel, promise and fulfillment, and to ground justification in union with Christ.
 - Theological moves:
 - Posits Christ as federal representative whose obedience/obedience-accounting secures justification (imputation language).
 - Uses covenant categories to explain sacraments as seals and signs of the promise (baptism/communion).
 - Balances divine sovereignty and human responsibility within covenant obligations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Augustine, medieval scholastics, Luther (contrast), biblical exegesis (Paul, covenantal motifs in OT).
 - Modern interlocutors in the volume and in subsequent use: proponents/critics of Federal Vision monocovenantalism; proponents of Meredith Kline's redemptive-historical covenant model (and related "intrusion ethics").
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture as covenant witness), covenant (works/grace, federal headship), Trinity (economic roles in covenant), Christology (mediatorial union, obedience), soteriology (imputation, justification), sacraments, law/gospel distinction.
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's federal theology centers the redemptive economy around Christ the covenant head: covenantal promise, corporate union, and sacramental sealing integrate justification, sanctification, and ecclesial identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Federal headship and organic union**: Calvin stresses not merely legal imputation but a living union with Christ that secures righteousness and sanctification.
 - **Sacrament as sealing covenantal promise**: sacraments function primarily as seals/confirmations of the covenant, not independent conveyors of salvific grace apart from faith.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against scholastic privatized merit: Calvin reorients merit/obedience to Christ's representative work rather than human supererogation.
 - In contrast to Luther, Calvin gives more systematic shape to covenant ordering (less emphasis on forensic only; more corporate, ecclesial framework).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidation of **covenant language** (foedus/testamentum) as hermeneutical key across law, gospel, and sacraments.
 - Emphasis on **federal representation** as explanatory of imputation and corporate election.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong shaping of classical Reformed orthodoxy and confessions (Westminster, Second Helvetic, etc.).
 - Modern reception is contested:
 - **Federal Vision Monocovenantalism** draws on Calvinic covenant continuity but departs by emphasizing a single covenantal economy and differing sacramental/communion implications.
 - **Klinean Covenant Theology** reads Calvin redemptively but pushes the redemptive-historical (intrusion) ethics for social/political application, sometimes critiqued as overstating the covenant-political intrusion into common life.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable, integrated model linking Christology, soteriology, and ecclesiology; indispensable for exegetical and systematic studies of the covenant in Reformed theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (foedus/testamentum)** - the organizing framework for God's dealings; promise+obligation+seal.
- **Covenant of Works** - prelapsarian probation paradigm used in Reformed exegesis (background for Calvinian discussions, though Calvin is less metaphysical about it than later scholastics).
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's promise-mediated arrangement in Christ securing sinners; central to Calvin's soteriology.
- **Federal headship** - Christ as representative (federal) head whose obedience/obedience-accounting secures benefits for the elect.
- **Imputation** - forensic transfer: Christ's righteousness accounted to believers; Calvin ties this to union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ** - organic, mystical-corporate bond that grounds justification, sanctification, and sacramental reality.
- **Sacraments as seals** - baptism and the Lord's Supper are external signs that confirm the covenant promise to believers.
- **Law/Gospel distinction** - law reveals covenant obligations; gospel proclaims fulfillment and promise in Christ.
- **Justification by faith (sola fide)** - forensic act rooted in union with Christ and covenant promise; faith receives the imputed righteousness.
- **Monocovenantalism (Federal Vision)** - modern reading that emphasizes one covenant of grace-continuity; engages Calvin but revises sacramental and covenant-boundary doctrines.
- **Klinean Covenant Theology** - redemptive-historical covenant framework stressing polity/kingdom patterns; influences "intrusion ethics" (the idea that covenantal redemption intrudes into societal/political structures).
- **Intrusion ethics** - (Klinean-associated) ethic asserting covenant norms press into public life and law; used to develop covenant-based social ethics.
- **Representation vs. Participation** - Calvin balances forensic representation (imputation) with participatory union (real communion with Christ).
- **Predestination/election** - covenantal orientation of divine choosing, integrated with corporate covenant promises.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed covenant categories (works/grace, headship, sacramental sealing).
- As a **polemic resource** against Roman sacramentalism and later intra-Reformed deviances (e.g., critiques of Federal Vision overreach).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading covenant texts (Paul/OT covenant motifs) and for framing redemptive-historical theology (basis for both Klinean appropriation and critique).
