### TITLE
The Fulfillment of the Law and Prophets: Christ and the Law in Pauline Theology (essay by Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in Kingdom, Covenants & Canon of the Old Testament)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship; produced within Westminster/Princeton-influenced evangelical-covenantal milieu.
 - Written as a corrective to both antinomian readings and some strains of the New Perspective on Paul that posit radical discontinuity between Torah and Christ.
 - Site usage: engages Romans 11 and the question of Israel's future as a test-case for covenantal continuity.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christ is the **telos** (end/fulfillment) of the Law and the Prophets in a manner that secures both the covenantal promises to Israel and the moral-normative validity of the Law for the church; fulfillment does not equal abolition but consummation and transformation in Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preliminary exegetical ground-work on Pauline key terms (telos, pleroo, nomos) and canonical shape of "Law and Prophets."
 - Argues for a redemptive-historical (Christocentric) hermeneutic: Christ as the center that brings promise, typology, and law to their intended completion.
 - Distinguishes dimensions of the Law:
 - Covenant-bound function (judicial, covenant marker) that pointed forward to Christ and finds its terminus in the new covenant people;
 - Moral-normative function (ethics, portrayal of God's will) that retains authority as revealed truth and as fulfilled in Christ.
 - Applies these distinctions to Pauline soteriology and ecclesiology, showing how justification, imputation, and sanctification operate within fulfilled-but-not-abolished law.
 - Uses Romans 11 to show fulfillment does not negate God's faithfulness to Israel; eschatological promise and corporate future remain within Christ-centered consummation.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (esp. Romans), Second Temple context implicitly considered.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: New Perspective proponents (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) and historical Reformed interpreters (Calvin, B. B. Warfield, Geerhardus Vos).
 - Canonical and covenantal theologians who stress continuity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, Christology, Pauline soteriology (justification, imputation), hermeneutics (typology, fulfillment), ecclesiology, eschatology (Israel's future).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: Christ's fulfillment of the Law and Prophets secures covenantal continuity - the promises to Israel and the moral authority of the Law find their consummation in Christ and the church without reducing the Law to mere antiquated statute or preserving it intact as covenantal boundary.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear functional differentiation of the Law's dimensions (covenantal/job-judicial vs. moral-ethical) as a way to hold continuity and transformation together.
 - Strong canonical, Christocentric hermeneutic that reads Paul within the unity of Scripture rather than isolating legal texts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects antinomian tendencies that dismiss the Law's ongoing normative force.
 - Counters some New Perspective readings that downplay the enduring moral witness of Torah or construe Pauline fulfillment as mere replacement without continuity.
 - Reframes "fulfillment" away from simple abrogation or mere typology toward consummation within covenant-historical continuity.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes functional categories (telos, covenantal function vs moral function) as hermeneutical tools rather than merely semantic observations.
 - Stresses canonical teleology: law and prophets must be read forward to Christ, not simply historically.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed academic circles as a robust defense of covenantal continuity and a measured critique of the New Perspective.
 - Influential for pastors and scholars seeking an integrated Pauline-canonical approach to law, gospel, and Israel.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for treating tensions in Pauline theology (law vs gospel; Israel vs church) that is useful for exegesis, dogmatics, and homiletics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Telos (end/fulfillment)** - Christ as the goal and consummation of law and prophecy rather than its simple negation.
- **Pleroo (fulfill)** - fulfillment as bringing to intended completion within covenant-historical redemptive plan.
- **Nomos (Law)** - analyzed functionally: covenantal/judicial role vs moral-ethical role.
- **Law and Prophets** - canonical unit whose promises and demands find resolution in Christ.
- **Covenant continuity** - insistence that God's promises (including those to Israel) remain operative and find their consummation in Christ.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - reading Scripture Christocentrically and teleologically.
- **Justification / imputation** - doctrine situated within fulfillment: justification is by faith in Christ who fulfills the law's righteous requirements.
- **Typology** - prophetic and legal anticipations realized in Christ as historical and soteriological fulfillment.
- **Already / not-yet eschatology** - framework for understanding present fulfillment and future consummation (applies to Israel's future in Romans 11).
- **Ecclesiology** - church as the community in which fulfilled law continues to function morally and normatively.
- **Israel's future (Romans 11)** - evidence that fulfillment preserves (and transforms) corporate promises to Israel rather than annulling them.
- **Canon-focused approach** - treats Pauline texts within the wider canonical witness to Law and Prophets.
- **Moral-normative continuity** - law retains ethical authority as disclosure of God's will in Christ.

- How this work is used:
 - As a definitional source for a covenantal understanding of "fulfillment" in Pauline theology.
 - As a polemic resource against both antinomian readings and overstated discontinuity claims from some New Perspective variants.
 - As an exegetical model for treating Pauline passages (notably Romans 11) in service of dogmatic concerns about Israel, covenant, and law.
