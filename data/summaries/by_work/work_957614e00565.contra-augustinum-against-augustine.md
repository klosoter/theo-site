### TITLE
Contra Augustinum (Against Augustine) - Julian of Eclanum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 5th century (Julian c. 386-455). Composed in the aftermath of the Pelagian controversy (Council of Carthage 418; imperial edicts thereafter). Julian, bishop of Eclanum, wrote as the leading Pelagian polemicist defending Pelagius and Caelestius against Augustine and the African party.
 - The work is situated within the broader fight over **original sin, grace, free will, and predestination** that shaped late antique Western theology and subsequent medieval reception.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A systematic rebuttal of Augustine's claims that human nature is radically corrupted by Adam (original guilt), that grace is irresistibly efficacious or exclusively decisive, and that God predestines many to reprobation.
 - Julian affirms human moral responsibility and the real freedom to accept or reject grace; he denies transmitted guilt and reinterprets Adamic effects as injury or death-bearing propensity rather than forensic guilt.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: Augustine misconstrues Scripture and the Fathers, conflating concupiscence and guilt.
 - Anthropological alternative: Adam's sin wounded nature (concupiscence/weakness) but did not impute guilt to descendants.
 - Soteriological reformulation: Grace is necessary but co-operative - it enlightens and aids will; it does not destroy freedom nor render assent involuntary.
 - Doctrinal polemic: Augustine's predestination is shown to undermine divine justice and moral exhortation; culpability must remain with persons.
 - Scriptural and patristic appeals: Julian reads Paul and earlier Fathers to support non-forensic transmission and to secure moral responsibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Augustine of Hippo (especially On Nature and Grace, On the Spirit and the Letter, and anti-Pelagian letters).
 - Allies and antecedents: Pelagius, Caelestius; appeals to certain Eastern and Western patristic texts selectively interpreted.
 - Contextual antagonists: African bishops, imperial councils enforcing anti-Pelagian rulings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (original sin, concupiscence, human nature)
 - Grace (prevenient, assistive, cooperative vs. efficacious/irresistible)
 - Free will and moral responsibility
 - Predestination and reprobation
 - Baptismal theology (esp. infant baptism and its effects)
 - Scriptural hermeneutics and patristic authority

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: strong affirmation of human freedom and moral responsibility coupled with a non-forensic account of Adam's legacy and a cooperative, non-deterministic account of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Persistent insistence that Adam's sin transmits weakness or mortality, not objective guilt; distinguishes between concupiscence and culpability.
 - Robust defense of the will's ongoing agency - grace assists rather than irresistibly causes saving acts.

- **Corrections or contrasts to Augustine**
 - Rejects Augustine's forensic imputation of Adam's guilt to all humans and his model of grace as overpowering will.
 - Argues Augustine's predestination undermines exhortation, repentance, and God's justice.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear operative distinction between **injuria (injury)** and **culpa (guilt)** regarding Adamic consequences.
 - Strong articulation of **cooperatio**: grace and will as genuinely cooperative rather than unilateral divine action.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Officially marginalized and condemned alongside Pelagianism; Julian was repeatedly exiled and his views labeled heretical by Western councils.
 - Indirect long-term influence: his arguments reappear in later semi-Pelagian, medieval debates over free will, and in early modern Arminian critiques of strict predestination.
 - Reformed and Augustinian traditions largely treat him as a foil; modern scholars value him for theological diversity in late antiquity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides the clearest contemporary alternative to Augustinianism, useful for teaching contrasts on sin, grace, and freedom.
 - Serves as a primary-source resource for the development of doctrines later reframed in semi-Pelagian, medieval, and early modern disputes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin / Adamic guilt**
 - Julian: denies forensic imputation; sees transmission as propensity to death and weakness, not inherited guilt.

- **Concupiscence**
 - Central as the postlapsarian inclination; morally significant but not equated with imputed guilt.

- **Grace (gratia)**
 - Necessary, illuminating, enabling aid; principally cooperative, not coercive.

- **Prevenient grace**
 - Emphasized functionally: grace that precedes decision but preserves free assent.

- **Free will (liberum arbitrium)**
 - Retained as decisive for moral responsibility; will can cooperate with or resist grace.

- **Predestination (praedestinatio)**
 - Opposed in its Augustinian determinist form; seen as incompatible with divine justice and exhortation.

- **Imputation / forensic language**
 - Julian rejects forensic transfer of guilt; prefers medical/causal metaphors (injury, contagion, mortality).

- **Cooperatio**
 - Key term for the joint action of grace and the human will.

- **Infant baptism**
 - Julian accepts baptism for infants but denies that baptism erases imputed guilt (since none is imputed); he focuses on baptism's role in incorporation and remedy.

- **Patristic appeal**
 - Uses selective patristic citations to argue continuity with earlier interpreters against Augustine's reading.

- **Moral exhortation / pastoral implications**
 - Emphasizes preaching and moral responsibility as meaningful because human choice matters.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **polemic**: primary source for Pelagian rebuttal to Augustinianism.
 - As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates an alternative Pauline reading emphasizing will and responsibility.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: resource for debates on prevenient grace and the nature of original sin in later medieval and modern discussions.
