### TITLE
**The End of Deuteronomy in the Epistles of Paul (2006) - Guy Prentiss Waters**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published 2006 amid vigorous debate over Pauline theology sparked by the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Engages late 20th-early 21st century historical and canonical approaches to Paul, with close attention to Old Testament intertextuality.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Paul's argument for justification, law, and covenant in the epistles is best understood through the rhetorical and canonical frame of the *end of Deuteronomy* (especially Deut 27-30). This Deuteronomic matrix explains Paul's language of curse/blessing, choice of life/death, covenant failure, and the forensic character of justification - countering readings that minimize forensic imputation and traditional Reformed categories.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Part A: Establishes the content and rhetorical shape of Deut 27-30 (curses, blessings, covenant choice) as a discrete theological unit in Israel's scripture.
 - Part B: Demonstrates literary and theological echoes of that Deuteronomic end in Paul's major soteriological arguments (primarily Galatians and Romans).
 - Shows how Paul recasts Israel's covenant failure and the Deuteronomic curse to explain Christ's vicarious suffering and believers' justification.
 - Argues Paul reads Jesus as the new representative, absorbing the curse and thereby enabling a forensic declaration of righteousness.
 - Part C: Engages contemporary interpreters (especially NPP figures), critiquing their reduction of Paul to boundary-marker concerns and reasserting forensic, imputation-focused readings grounded in OT intertextuality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutors: N.T. Wright, E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn (New Perspective advocates); also classical Reformed interpreters and Pauline commentators. Extensive attention to Deuteronomy, Paul's epistles (Galatians, Romans), and Second Temple intertexts.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Justification (forensic imputation), covenant and covenant failure, law and works of the law, representative/ federal headship, typology, Christology in Paul's representative role, Pauline hermeneutics.
- **Closing line:** 
 - Waters argues that recognizing Paul's Deuteronomic frame restores the forensic, representative logic of Paul's soteriology and clarifies contested readings advanced by the New Perspective.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Treats *the end of Deuteronomy* as a controlling hermeneutical key for Paul rather than mere background allusion; places Deut 27-30 at the center of Pauline rhetoric about curse, law, and covenant failure.
 - Strong defense of **forensic imputation** and representative substitution as Paul's explanatory center for justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Challenges NPP tendency to naturalize Paul as primarily concerned with ethnic boundary markers or social-covenantal membership; reclaims individual and corporate forensic language as rooted in Deuteronomy's legal-covenantal scheme.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Labels the Deut 27-30 corpus as an operative "lens" for Paul; emphasizes the legal "curse/blessing" motif as a hermeneutical category for Pauline soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Well regarded in conservative/Reformed circles and among scholars who stress OT intertextuality; frequently cited in debates over imputation and the NPP. Less persuasive to those who prioritize socio-rhetorical readings or divergent Second Temple intertexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Models careful intertextual exegesis; supplies a concise defense of forensic justification grounded in OT canonical context; valuable in courses on Paul, justification, and OT-NT hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **End of Deuteronomy (Deut 27-30):** The curses/blessings, choice of life/ death, covenant sanctions seen as Paul's primary OT matrix.
- **Covenant curse/blessing motif:** Legal language Paul repurposes to frame Christ's vicarious curse-bearing and the believer's blessing (righteous standing).
- **Forensic imputation:** The doctrine that righteousness is legally credited to believers on account of Christ's representative work; central claim defended throughout.
- **Representative/federal headship:** Christ as the new Adam/Moses-like representative who stands in solidarity and bears covenant consequences for his people.
- **Justification by faith:** Treated as a declarative, covenant-legal pronouncement rooted in Deuteronomic law/curse motifs, not merely ethical renewal or boundary-status.
- **Works of the law:** Reinterpreted against NPP reductionism; Waters argues Paul's antithesis is not only boundary markers but also the law's merit-based curse/boon logic.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP) critiques:** The book directly addresses and contests NPP claims about Paul's priorities and vocabulary.
- **Typology and intertextuality:** Methodological stress on canonical typological reading - Paul's use of Israel's narrative as theological precedent.
- **Covenantal nomism (contrast):** The NPP concept that obedience is the mark of covenant membership; Waters contrasts this with Paul's legal-covenantal account rooted in Deut.
- **Curse of the law:** A legal-theological category Paul uses to explain Christ's death, per Waters' reading.
- **Corporate solidarity:** Emphasizes communal/representative identity (not merely sociological markers) in Pauline theology.
- **Pauline hermeneutics:** Demonstrates Paul's canonical reading practice that links OT covenant law to Christ's work.
- **Expiatory substitution:** Connected to curse-bearing and imputation in Waters' interpretation.
- **End-use notes - how this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for readings that integrate Deut 27-30 into Paul's soteriology.
 - As a **polemic** against NPP readings that downplay forensic imputation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for OT-NT intertextuality in teaching Paul and justification.
