### TITLE
The Law Is Not of Faith: Essays on Works and Grace in the Mosaic Covenant - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed scholarship addressing late-20th/21st-century disputes over the Mosaic covenant: debates between classical covenant theology, the New Perspective on Paul, and streams of intra-Reformed controversy (including Federal Vision and related proposals).
 - A corrective work coming from conservative Reformed/evangelical circles seeking to defend covenantal continuity and traditional doctrines of justification and grace.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Mosaic covenant should not be construed as a covenant of works that meritoriously secures justification; rather it is an administration of the covenant of grace in which **works (obedience) function as covenantal duties and signs of life, but not as meritorious ground of acceptance before God**.
 - The problem addressed: how to account for Israel's law, the role of works, and Pauline statements about "works" without collapsing into either works-righteousness or antinomian readings.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Textual-exegetical move: careful readings of Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) to distinguish "works" as covenantal obedience from "works" as meritorious self-justification.
 - Historical-theological move: survey and synthesis of Reformation and post-Reformation covenant theology (Calvin, Bavinck, Murray, Vos, etc.) to show precedent for viewing Mosaic law as gracious administration.
 - Doctrinal-systematic move: refine covenant categories (covenant of works vs covenant of grace; administration vs covenant substance) to preserve Christ-centered continuity in soteriology.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial move: implications for preaching law and gospel, assurance, and Christian obedience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and modern Reformed theologians: Calvin, Augustine as tradition-bearers; Bavinck, Murray, Vos for covenantal formulations.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: New Perspective proponents (e.g., E. P. Sanders, N. T. Wright) and intra-Reformed critics (some Federal Vision proponents, Meredith Kline's typological approach).
 - Pauline corpus and Old Testament covenant materials used as primary exegetical bases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (administrations, continuity/discontinuity)
 - Law (moral, ceremonial, civil distinctions), grace, justification, imputation, sanctification, typology and Christology (fulfilment of the law)

- **Closing line**
 - Fesko's theological center: the Mosaic law is best understood as a gracious covenantal administration that requires works as covenant obedience but does not make those works the basis of justification; Christ is the locus of covenant continuity and fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing *works* as covenantal duty from *works* as meritorious basis for righteousness; sustained stress on law as covenantal administration rather than a rival soteriological system.
 - Integration of rigorous Pauline exegesis with classical Reformed covenant categories rather than adopting either an entirely new "third way" or wholesale acceptance of New Perspective labels.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that cast the Mosaic covenant as essentially a covenant of works (which would threaten sola fide).
 - Corrects some New Perspective tendencies that reduce the law to ethnic boundary markers by recovering its covenantal, moral and typological dimensions.
 - Responds to intra-Reformed proposals that over-privilege continuity to the point of blurring justification and sanctification.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the term **"administration of the covenant of grace"** for Mosaic law discussions.
 - Distinguishes between *covenantal works* (obedience as covenant duty/sign) and *meritorious works* (earning acceptance).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in conservative Reformed seminaries and study contexts as a corrective resource; frequently cited in discussions on Mosaic covenant, Pauline theology, and law/gospel preaching.
 - Seen as strengthening classical covenantal responses to both New Perspective and Federal Vision critiques.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for seminarians and pastors requiring a compact, exegetically grounded defense of covenantal continuity that preserves sola fide while taking seriously covenantal obedience and the integrity of the Mosaic law.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic covenant**
 - The covenant given at Sinai; treated as an administration of God's covenantal dealings, not a separate covenant of works that earns salvation.

- **Covenant of works**
 - The pre-Fall covenant concept (Adamic) often contrasted with covenant of grace; Fesko resists collapsing Mosaic law into this category.

- **Covenant of grace**
 - The overarching covenant structure; Mosaic law belongs to an *administration* of this covenant in Fesko's scheme.

- **Administration of the covenant**
 - Key technical phrase: temporal, historical forms by which the one covenant of grace is mediated (e.g., Mosaic, Abrahamic, Christian administrations).

- **Works (covenantal vs meritorious)**
 - Divergent senses distinguished: *covenantal works* = required obedience/signs of covenant life; *meritorious works* = attempt to earn justification (rejected as the law's promised function).

- **Works of the law**
 - Pauline phrase examined: Fesko interprets it in covenantal terms - obligations and identity markers - not as a means of achieving righteousness before God.

- **Law (moral/ceremonial/civil)**
 - Law distinctions retained but reframed within covenant administration; moral law binding, ceremonial and civil laws typological and temporary but covenantally significant.

- **Justification / imputation**
 - Justification remains forensic and by faith; imputation of Christ's righteousness central to solving the law/works tension.

- **Typology / fulfillment**
 - Mosaic rites and ordinances are typological, pointing to Christ; their covenant role is pedagogical and covenant-mediatory.

- **Representative headship**
 - Headship language used to explain corporate responsibility and how Israel's obedience/failure relates to covenant blessings.

- **Sanctions / blessings & curses**
 - Covenant enforcement mechanisms clarified as covenantal, not evidence that the Mosaic law functions as meritorious ground.

- Uses across loci
 - Definition source: concise working definitions for "administration of the covenant" and "works" distinctions.
 - Polemic: a go-to corrective against readings that make Mosaic law a system of merit (both New Perspective extremes and any covenant-of-works readings).
 - Exegetical model: template for reading Pauline statements about law and works in covenant-historical context.
 - Conceptual pivot: employed in courses on covenant theology, preaching law/gospel, and justification to hold together obedience and grace.
