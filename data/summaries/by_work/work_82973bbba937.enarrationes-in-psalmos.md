### TITLE
Enarrationes in Psalmos - Augustine of Hippo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 4th-early 5th century (sermon series delivered and revised at Hippo, c. 392-427). Pastoral-litur gical context: homiletic expositions of the Psalter addressed to an African episcopal congregation amid Donatist and Pelagian controversies.
 - Milieu: Western Latin patristic theology shaped by Ambrose, engaged with Origenic allegory, and reacting to Pelagian stress on human moral ability.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalms are the Church's primary songbook and a Christocentric scripture whose senses (literal, moral, allegorical) must be read under the illumination of the Holy Spirit to yield catechesis, devotion, and doctrine.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical homilies proceed psalm-by-psalm; method blends careful literal-historical attention with spiritual (allegorical/typological) application.
 - Identify the immediate (Davidic, historical) sense of the Psalm.
 - Expose Christological and ecclesial fulfillment: David as type, Christ as antitype, Church as present realization.
 - Draw moral and ascetical exhortations for the Christian life shaped by grace.
 - Recurrent theological loci: Scripture as living Word, pneumatological illumination, typology of Old to New, continuity of covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Influences: Ambrose (homiletic method), Origen (allegorical exegesis, but corrected where speculative), Jerome (Vulgate use), Platonic interiority.
 - Controversial interlocutors: Pelagianism (requires emphasis on grace), Donatism (ecclesial identity and sacramental integrity).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology: authority and multifaceted senses of Scripture; the Spirit as guarantor of true sense.
 - Christology: Psalms witness to Christ as prophet, priest, king (threefold office implicit).
 - Covenant theology: typological continuity between Israel and Church; covenant as divine promise fulfilled in Christ.
 - Trinity: psalm-texts read in light of Father-Son-Spirit revelation; inner Trinitarian relations applied to worship and prayer.
 - Eschatology: psalms used to teach resurrection, final judgment, Israel/Church destinies (emphasis on divine mystery and mercy).
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine reads the Psalms as Spirit-illuminated Scripture that forms the Church by showing Christ in Israel's song and shaping believerly life through typology, covenantal continuity, and pastoral application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of pastoral homiletics with systematic insight: doctrine grows from liturgical exposition rather than abstract syllogism.
 - Interiorist hermeneutic: emphasis on the heart and Spirit as loci of true understanding (lumen interioris).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moderates Origenic allegory: employs allegory responsibly, grounded in historical sense and Christic fulfillment; resists overly speculative cosmologies.
 - Opposes Pelagian moralism by reading Psalms as dependent on God's prevenient and operative grace.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of typology: Davidic figures, liturgical words, and covenant signs are read as living anticipations fulfilled in Christ and the eucharistic/communal life of the Church.
 - Pneumatological hermeneutic: the Holy Spirit as the authoritative interpreter of Scripture's inner sense-precursor to later doctrines of illumination.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on medieval exegesis and monastic lectio divina; served as one of the West's chief models for Psalm commentary.
 - Reformed reception: Augustine a central doctrinal ancestor (notably on sin and grace); Reformers selectively appropriated his Christocentric and Scripture-centered readings while rejecting excessive allegory.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a hermeneutic that unites exegesis, worship, and doctrine; indispensable for pastoral theology, typological reading, and doctrines of illumination.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Enarrationes (expositions)** - extended homiletic commentaries on individual psalms; model for pastoral theology.
- **Sensus litteralis / sensus spiritualis** - Augustine's balancing of historical-surface meaning with moral and allegorical senses.
- **Lumen Scripturae / lumen interioris** - Scripture as self-witnessing when opened by the Holy Spirit's inner light.
- **Typus / antitypos** - David and Israel as types; Christ and the Church as fulfillment; foundational for Christ in OT and NT reflections.
- **Munus triplex (implicit)** - prophetic, priestly, kingly functions applied christologically in Psalm exposition.
- **Spiritual Israel / remnant** - interpretive move reading corporate Israel fulfilled in the Church while affirming divine mercy toward ethnic Israel (connects with Romans 11 themes).
- **Illuminatio (role of the Spirit)** - Spirit as necessary interpreter and teacher of Scripture; sanctifying effect on hearers.
- **Foedus / pactum (covenant language)** - Augustine uses covenantal motifs to articulate continuity and fulfillment in Christ, influencing later confessional formulations.
- **Christus in Psalterio** - consistent christological reading that anchors NT fulfillment claims in OT worship texts.
- **Typology and fulfillment** - method for reading predictive and prefigurative elements in Psalms.
- **Trinitas (Trinity witness)** - Psalms read as compatible with New Testament revelation of the Triune God; used to argue OT/NT continuity on Trinitarian speech.
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology** - Augustine's work functions as biblical-theological exposition that supplies data later systematizers used for doctrine.
- **Canon + liturgy** - use of Psalms in public prayer shapes doctrinal formation; exegetical moves are ecclesial, not merely academic.

How the work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating literal and spiritual senses in preaching and pastoral theology.
- As a **source for doctrines** of Scripture (illumination), Christology (typology), and covenant continuity used by later confessions.
- As a **polemic resource** against Pelagian moralism and for ecclesial sacramental reading.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Psalter worship to Trinitarian and eschatological theology.
