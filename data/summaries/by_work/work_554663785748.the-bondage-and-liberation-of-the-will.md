### TITLE
The Bondage and Liberation of the Will - John Calvin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th-century Reformation; Calvin writing amid Protestant‑Catholic controversies and Augustine's retrenchment. Part of Calvin's broader soteriological and pastoral corpus (convergent with Institutes material).
 - Audience: pastors, disputants, students grappling with free will, grace, predestination, and pastoral assurance.
- **Central thesis**
 - Humanity's will is **enslaved to sin** and incapable of true spiritual movement toward God apart from sovereign, efficacious divine grace; liberation comes only in union with Christ by the Holy Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Scriptural and experiential proof of bondage - human inability, corruption of affections, and moral impotence.
 - Augustinian appeal: continuity with Augustine against Pelagian/semipelagian optimism about human freedom.
 - Divine initiative: predestination, effectual calling, and regeneration as the single causal chain that secures salvation.
 - Pastoral implications: assurance, perseverance, and the necessity of reliance on Christ's imputed righteousness.
- **Major moves (sub-bullets)**
 - Exegesis of Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Ephesians) to establish depravity and divine sovereignty.
 - Philosophical-theological refutation of synergism: will does not cooperate prior to grace; any "consent" is itself a product of grace.
 - Positive account of liberation: the Spirit unites sinners to Christ, imparts new will, and secures sanctification and perseverance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Augustine as primary exemplar; polemical orientation against Pelagians, Roman Catholic synergists, and later anticipatory critiques from Arminian perspectives.
 - Uses Scripture (OT and NT), patristic testimony, and scholastic categories selectively.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Soteriology** (total depravity, regeneration, justification, imputation, atonement), **Pneumatology** (regenerating Spirit, baptism of the Spirit, union with Christ), **Theology Proper** (sovereignty, predestination, divine attributes), **Christology** (mediation and imputed righteousness), **Doctrine of the Trinity** (economic actions in salvation).
- **Closing line**
 - The tract centers the Reformed conviction that only sovereign, efficacious grace - administered through the Spirit in union with Christ - frees the will and secures salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight integration of anthropology (bondage) and pneumatology (liberation): the will's freedom is a fruit of **regeneration**, not a precondition for it.
 - Stress on **efficacious calling** and the causal primacy of divine grace in conversion.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves beyond Luther by systematizing the role of union with Christ and forensic imputation within a pastoral framework.
 - Sharp rejection of Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian appeals to an autonomous human capacity to choose God.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses "bondage" and "liberation" as paired theological primitives to analyze will, rather than treating freedom as neutral volitional power.
 - Clarifies the relation between **absolute** (God's necessary being, immutability) and **relative** (divine condescension, covenantal action) attributes in the economy of salvation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Reformed confessions and post‑Reformation scholasticism; influential in debates over predestination, assurance, and the extent of the atonement.
 - Primary source for Protestant polemics against synergism and for later defenders of "irresistible" or "effectual" grace.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, exegetically grounded argument for Reformed soteriology; indispensable for teaching on depravity, regeneration, and pastoral assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Bondage of the will** - human will enslaved by sin; cannot choose God unaided.
- **Liberation (of the will)** - result of regeneration; Spirit‑wrought liberty that enables true love of God.
- **Total depravity** - corruption of all faculties, inclinations governed by sin.
- **Predestination / election** - God's eternal decree ordering salvation; grounds pastoral assurance and divine initiative.
- **Effectual calling / efficacious grace** - grace that infallibly brings the elect to faith and repentance.
- **Regeneration (new birth)** - Spirit's ontological renewal that produces a new will and spiritual life.
- **Union with Christ** - mystical/forensic nexus by which justification, sanctification, and perseverance are secured.
- **Forensic justification / imputation** - Christ's righteousness accounted to believers; human will's role is receptive, not foundational.
- **Atonement (necessity, extent, theory)** - necessary for redemption; Calvin leans to definite application to the elect while retaining penal‑substitution motifs.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - sacramental and experiential markers of incorporation into Christ; Spirit effects liberation.
- **Assurance and perseverance** - logical and pastoral fruit of regeneration, union, and God's immutable decree.
- **Divine condescension / attributes (absolute vs relative)** - God remains sovereign and immutable yet condescends covenantally to effect salvation; used against open‑theist readings.
- **Scriptural exegesis (OT & NT)** - Calvin's method grounds theological claims primarily in Pauline and prophetic texts.
- **Human will (libertas)** - redefined: not metaphysical autonomy but moral orientation reshaped by grace.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on depravity, regeneration, and efficacious grace.
 - As **polemic** against synergism, Pelagianism, and later Arminian objections; often invoked in debates on free will.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline soteriology (Romans, Ephesians) that unites forensic and mystical elements.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Pneumatology (regeneration, baptism of the Spirit) with Doctrine of Salvation (justification, assurance).
