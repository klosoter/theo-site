### TITLE
**"The Message of the Kingdom" - Edmund P. Clowney (contributor) in The Goldsworthy Trilogy** 
(Contributions framed within the late-20th-century Reformed/biblical-theology movement emphasizing typology and fulfillment)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical Reformed milieu; part of the broader biblical-theology recovery associated with the Goldsworthy school. Clowney brings a pastoral, homiletical refinement to a canonical, Christ-centered hermeneutic.
 - Reaction against both liberal fragmentation of Scripture and dispensational partitioning; aims to recover a unified storyline that culminates in Christ's kingdom.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament proclaims a coherent kingdom promise that is typologically structured and finds its decisive fulfillment in the person, work, and rule of Jesus Christ. Proper preaching and interpretation must read OT types and promises as prophetic anticipations, not isolated curiosities.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Affirm the unity of Scripture: the Bible narrates one covenantal drama oriented toward the kingdom.
 - Identify kingdom promises in the OT (kingship, temple, covenant blessings) and show their typological embodiment in figures and institutions (e.g., David, Moses, the tabernacle/temple, sacrificial system).
 - Demonstrate fulfillment in Christ:
 - Jesus as the Davidic King, true Priest, and new Temple.
 - His life, death, resurrection, and eschatological rule realize and inaugurate the kingdom.
 - Draw pastoral and ecclesial implications:
 - Church as kingdom community called to witness to Christ's reign.
 - Ethical and eschatological dimensions: now/not-yet nature of the kingdom for preaching and discipleship.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts with Graeme Goldsworthy's canonical, Christocentric method; draws on Vosian and classical Reformed covenant theology; implicitly contrasts dispensationalists and liberal critics.
 - Uses biblical narrative and typological exegesis more than systematic abstraction.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canonical and Christ-centered), Covenant, Christology (person and offices), Kingdom and eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), Typology, Ecclesiology, elements of sacramental theology insofar as temple/altar imagery is concerned.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the Bible's kingdom message is fundamentally typological and covenantal-its promises converge on Christ, whose person and rule are both the fulfillment and the pattern for the church's life and proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong homiletical bent: Clowney presses typology as a preaching tool that maintains canonical integrity and pastoral relevance.
 - Emphasis on Christ's kingship as the organizing motif for reading OT institutions.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensational separations of Testaments by insisting on organic typological continuity.
 - Pushes back against allegorical or ahistorical typologizing by insisting on covenantal and redemptive-historical constraints.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Treats typology as prophetic-covenantal correspondence rather than mere likeness: types point forward in a covenantal trajectory that culminates in Christ's rule.
 - Reframes "fulfillment" to include both decisive accomplished reality (Christ's work) and ongoing inaugurated rule (church and mission).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed preaching circles and seminaries as a model for Christ-centered exposition of the OT.
 - Influenced homiletics and introductory biblical theology courses; used as a corrective to atomistic or noncanonical exegesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Practical bridge between scholarly biblical theology and pastoral preaching; robust model for reading OT types without collapsing into allegory or dispensationalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology**
 - Theological method reading persons/institutions/events as divinely intended foreshadows of Christ and his kingdom.
- **Fulfillment**
 - Christ as the definitive realization of biblical promises; both accomplished (atonement/resurrection) and inaugurated (kingly rule).
- **Kingdom**
 - God's sovereign rule realized in Christ; has present (inaugurated) and future (consummated) dimensions.
- **Covenant**
 - The organizing framework for promise and fulfillment; typology is covenantally anchored.
- **Christocentric reading**
 - Canonical hermeneutic that interprets all Scripture in light of Christ as center and telos.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Kingdom as already begun in Christ but awaiting consummation; shapes ethics and mission.
- **Davidic kingship**
 - Key typological motif: Davidic promises point forward to Christ's eternal rule.
- **Temple/Tabernacle imagery**
 - OT cultic space seen as a type fulfilled in Christ (the true Temple) and reconstituted in the church.
- **Priest/King/Mediator**
 - Offices that find antitype in Christ's single mediatorial role.
- **Promise-Fulfillment pattern**
 - Structural reading principle: promise -> type -> Christ (fulfillment) -> church witness.
- **Canonical unity**
 - Stress on reading Scripture as a unified narrative rather than disparate texts.
- **Homiletical application**
 - Practical use: typological fulfillment as the bridge between exegesis and pastoral proclamation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a covenantal, typological notion of fulfillment and kingdom-centered hermeneutics.
- As an **exegetical and homiletical model** for preaching the OT Christologically without collapsing historical-grammatical constraints.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational partitioning of Scripture and against non-redemptive-allegorical typologizing.
