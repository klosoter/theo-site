### TITLE
**Petrus van Mastricht - Theoretical-Practical Theology, Vol. 2: Faith in the Triune God**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-early 18th century Reformed scholasticism infused with pietistic concern; Mastricht (1630-1706) writes within Dutch Reformed orthodoxy after the Synod of Dort, reacting to Arminianism, Amyraldian tendencies, and an increasing separation of speculative theology from pastoral piety.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Faith is the believer's Trinitarianly‑grounded appropriation of salvation secured in the eternal pactum salutis and effectuated in Christ as covenant head - a unity of doctrine and practice: sound speculative theology must serve sanctified, assured Christian life.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of the Trinity and intra‑divine counsel as the ontological ground for covenantal action (pactum salutis).
 - Doctrinal tracing of the covenant(s): pre‑lapsarian covenant of works, the pactum salutis (covenant of redemption), and the covenant of grace as the historic unfolded economy.
 - Christology: Christ as the appointed, representative covenant head whose active and passive obedience secure righteousness for the elect.
 - Soteriology and faith: faith as receptive instrument, incorporeal but effectual union with Christ, conditioned by Spirit‑wrought regeneration and leading to assurance and sanctification.
 - Practical conclusions: pastoral application, assurance of salvation, means of grace, and moral transformation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (primary), Augustine, Calvin; Reformed scholastics and contemporaries (Turretin, Voetius, Cocceius indirectly), polemics against Arminians and Socinians; frequently appeals to church practice and pastoral literature.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity, covenant theology (pactum salutis), Christology (hypostatic union, federal headship), justification (imputation, active/passive obedience), sanctification, regeneration, faith (nature and instrumentality), assurance, sacramental theology insofar as it mediates covenantal signs.
- **Closing line:** Faith is a Trinitarianly‑rooted, Christ‑centered appropriation of the eternal pactum salutis by which the believer is united to Christ the covenant head and transformed in life and assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *pactum salutis* as the intra‑Trinitarian, eternal basis of redemption - not merely economic accommodation but actual divine counsel and agreement.
 - Integration of rigorous scholastic method with pastoral, experiential aims: doctrine judged by its power to produce holiness and assurance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Arminian and Socinian denials of definitive covenantal decrees by grounding election and redemption in an eternal Trinitarian pact.
 - Distinguishes from some Cocceian or Amyraldian readings by maintaining a robust federal headship and non‑hypothetical pactum.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses classical scholastic precision to clarify relations: pactum salutis (intra‑Trinitarian pact) vs. covenant of grace (created economy) vs. covenant of works.
 - Stresses *Christ as covenant head* in both active and passive obedience language, bringing legal, forensic, and relational registers into one account.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in later Reformed circles for its pastoral‑scholastic synthesis; used by confessional theologians and pastors seeking an orthodox, piety‑oriented systematic theology.
 - Influenced covenantal treatments in subsequent Dutch and continental Reformed teaching; less known in popular anglophone circles until modern translations and studies.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model for integrating dogmatics and pastoral theology.
 - Clear, defense‑oriented account of pactum salutis and federal headship useful for teaching covenantal soteriology and pastoral assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum salutis (covenant of redemption):** Eternal intra‑Trinitarian agreement to accomplish salvation; ontological ground for Christ's mission and election.
- **Christ as covenant head:** Christ chosen and constituted representative of the elect; his person and obedience are legally imputed to believers.
- **Covenant of works vs. covenant of grace:** Distinction upheld; covenant of works as original probationary relation with Adam, covenant of grace as redemptive economy realized in Christ.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ's life of perfect law‑keeping (active) and substitutionary suffering/death (passive) together secure righteousness for the elect.
- **Imputation:** Forensic transfer of Christ's obedience/righteousness to believers; central to justification.
- **Faith (instrumental and receptive):** Faith receives the benefits secured in the pactum and applied by the Spirit; intellectual assent united to personal trust and fruitfulness.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological and relational bond by which believers share in Christ's benefits - ground of assurance and sanctification.
- **Regeneration and assurance:** Spirit‑wrought renewal that authenticates faith and grounds pastoral assurance without speculative presumption.
- **Trinitarian economy:** Ordering of Father, Son, and Spirit in decree and execution - guard against dividing intra‑divine counsel from redemptive history.
- **Representation (federalism):** Legal standing of Christ vis‑a‑vis elect; federal categories used for soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Practical theology (theoretical‑practical method):** Theology must mediate doctrinal truth into pastoral care, prayer, sacrament, and moral life.
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer as covenantal instruments for applying Christ's benefits.
- **Pastoral application:** Use of doctrines to foster sanctification, perseverance, and assurance in congregational life.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for pactum salutis and federal headship in covenantal soteriology.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminianism/Amyraldian modi that dilute intra‑Trinitarian decree and representation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Romans 5, Ephesians, and covenant passages linking Adam/Christ.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Trinitarian doctrine, Christology, and pastoral assurance in systematic and pastoral courses.
