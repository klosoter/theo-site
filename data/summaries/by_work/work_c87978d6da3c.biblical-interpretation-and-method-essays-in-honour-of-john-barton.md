### TITLE
**Biblical Interpretation and Method: Essays in Honour of John Barton** (eds. Stephen B. Chapman, Marvin R. Wilson)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Festschrift published in the late 20th/early 21st century scholarly milieu responding to shifts in biblical studies: waning dominance of classical historical-critical paradigms; rise of literary, canonical, and reception-history approaches; renewed interest in theological interpretation and the ethics of reading. Compiled to honor John Barton, whose work bridges historical scholarship and theological sensitivity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The volume argues, implicitly and explicitly through essays, that biblical interpretation requires methodological pluralism grounded in historical awareness and theological responsibility. The problem addressed is how to justify interpretive methods that are both academically defensible and theologically credible for communities that treat Scripture as normative.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Contributions survey and defend a range of methods (historical criticism, literary criticism, canonical approaches, reception history, theological exegesis) and explore their mutual constraints and complementarities. 
 - Several essays emphasize the ethical dimension of interpretation: interpreters bear responsibility for how texts shape communities and actions. 
 - The volume promotes methodological self-awareness: method is not neutral; choices presuppose epistemological and theological commitments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages the legacy of historical-critical scholars (e.g., Bultmann, Wellhausen) while dialoguing with literary critics and proponents of canonical and theological interpretation. 
 - Interacts with contemporary hermeneuticians who emphasize reception history, narrative approaches, and the role of community in meaning-making. 
 - Honors John Barton's own work on interpretation, ethics, and the history of reading.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation and authority** (how method affects claims about divine self-disclosure). 
 - **Scripture and canonicity** (theological status of canon and its interpretive consequences). 
 - **Ethics and community** (interpretive responsibility, social effects of readings). 
 - Secondary treatments: covenantal frameworks, aspects of Christology where exegetical method impinges on theological claim-making.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 The collection affirms that robust biblical interpretation is a disciplined, plural, and ethically aware practice that must hold historical sensibility and theological seriousness together.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on the ethical responsibilities of interpreters-interpretation as a moral act with ecclesial and social consequences. 
 - Methodological pluralism is argued not as relativism but as a dialogical posture where methods are critiqued and corrected by one another.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against exclusive claims of classical historical-critical monopoly and against triumphalist literary monism. 
 - Counters simplistic appeals to the canon as a method that automatically yields theological readings, insisting on historical and literary grounding.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes debates in terms of "method as practice" and "interpretive responsibility" rather than purely epistemic technique. 
 - Emphasizes "responsible pluralism" - a term describing accountable use of multiple methods.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Valued in academic circles for clarifying methodological interactions; used cautiously in confessional Reformed contexts that seek to protect doctrinal commitments while engaging critical scholarship. 
 - Widely cited in courses on hermeneutics and in discussions about integrating historical critique with theological interpretation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a compact map of late 20th/early 21st-century hermeneutical options and debates. 
 - Useful in training students to be methodologically self-aware and ethically sensitive interpreters.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics:** theory and practice of interpretation; the volume stresses both normative and descriptive dimensions. 
- **Historical-critical method:** analysis of texts in their historical contexts; treated as necessary but limited. 
- **Literary criticism:** attention to form, genre, narrative; deployed to recover literary sense and rhetorical force. 
- **Canonical criticism:** reading the text within the final shape of the canon; discussed as theological but requiring historical/literary support. 
- **Reception history (Wirkungsgeschichte):** study of how texts have been read and used over time; central to ethical and communal concerns. 
- **Theological interpretation of Scripture:** reading Scriptures within confession and doctrine; assessed for its interplay with scholarly methods. 
- **Intertextuality:** textual relations within Scripture and between Scripture and later texts; used to trace theological development. 
- **Authorial intent:** debated locus of meaning; the volume advocates cautious use alongside other controls. 
- **Methodological pluralism:** endorsement of multiple, complementary methods over single-method dominance. 
- **Interpretive responsibility:** ethical concept denoting consequences and obligations of readers and preachers. 
- **Canonicity:** the status and role of canon in shaping interpretation; treated as both constraint and resource. 
- **Contextualization:** awareness of contemporary contexts shaping reading and application. 
- **Exegetical-theological dialectic:** the ongoing tension and mutual correction between careful exegesis and theological construction. 
- **Normativity:** claims about Scripture's authority and how they inform methodological choices.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for methodological categories in advanced hermeneutics courses. 
 - As a **polemic** resource against monolithic methodological claims (both strictly historical-critical and purely literary or canonical absolutism). 
 - As an **exegetical model** illustrating integration of historical, literary, and theological readings. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the ethics of interpretation and the responsibilities of the interpreter.
