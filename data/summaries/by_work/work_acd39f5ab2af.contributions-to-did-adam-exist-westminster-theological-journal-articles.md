### TITLE
Contributions of Richard B. Gaffin Jr. to "Did Adam Exist?" (Westminster Theological Journal essays) - defense of Adam's historicity and federal headship

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed/evangelical debate over Adam (late 20th-21st c.); conversation spans biblical scholarship, evolutionary biology, and systematic theology; response to proposals that read Adam as non-historical, archetypal, or literary.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament (especially Paul) presupposes a historical Adam whose federal headship grounds the doctrines of original sin, imputation, and the typological/Christological reversal found in Christ; denying Adam's historicity undermines core Christian soteriology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical close readings of key Pauline texts (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) to establish the apostle's presupposition of an actual Adam as first human and covenantal representative.
 - Theological argument that the logic of imputation (sin/condemnation from Adam; righteousness/justification from Christ) requires a real, historical mediating figure.
 - Canonical-cum-systematic move: situating Pauline claims within Old Testament witness and the covenantal framework of Reformed theology (federal headship as covenantal structure).
 - Methodological defense: appeal to grammatical-historical exegesis, canonical coherence, and theological economy against literary/mythic reinterpretations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Pauline corpus as primary interlocutor; Old Testament creation narratives for background.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include scholars proposing non-historical or archetypal Adam readings (broadly, certain historical-critical and scientific-driven proposals) and advocates of theistic evolution who separate biological ancestry from theological Adam.
 - Reformed theological tradition (e.g., classic covenant theology) as confessional partner in analysis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (original sin; human nature), soteriology (atonement, imputation of righteousness), covenant/federal headship, biblical authority and hermeneutics, typology (Adam-Christ), and implications for creation and providence.
- **Closing line:** Gaffin argues that preserving Christian soteriology and the coherence of Pauline Christology requires affirming Adam as a historical federal head whose act and status are foundational for understanding sin, imputation, and Christ's representative work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the theological necessity of historicity for the doctrine of imputation - not merely an exegetical preference but a doctrinal hinge.
 - Integration of Pauline exegesis with Reformed covenantal categories rather than abstract philosophical accounts of personhood or metaphorical readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects readings that reduce Adam to a merely literary or archetypal figure by demonstrating how such readings fracture Pauline argumentation and theological logic.
 - Distinguishes his position from both naive literalism and reductive mythicism by grounding historicity in exegetical, canonical, and doctrinal criteria.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a tightly Christocentric hermeneutic that views Adam-Christ correspondence as constitutive for Pauline theology (not merely illustrative).
 - Recasts federal headship in contemporary debate as the decisive interpretive key for linking anthropology and soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used within confessional Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a precise scholarly rebuttal to non-historical Adam proposals.
 - Cited in debates over the compatibility of evolutionary biology with orthodox doctrine; influential for seminarians and pastors defending traditional doctrines of sin and imputation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models disciplined exegetical-theological method that refuses facile harmonization with scientific hypotheses when they threaten doctrinal coherence.
 - Functions as a concise manual for showing how biblical texts do theological work beyond mere historical reconstruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historicity of Adam:** The claim that Adam was an actual, first human being in history; treated as necessary for Pauline soteriological claims.
- **Federal headship (federalism):** Adam as covenantal representative whose act effects his many; basis for corporate solidarity and imputation.
- **Imputation (of sin / righteousness):** The forensic transfer of Adam's sin to humanity and of Christ's righteousness to believers; central to Gaffin's critique of non-historical readings.
- **Original sin / ancestral guilt:** The doctrine that sin and its consequences are transmitted through Adam as federal head.
- **Typology (Adam-Christ):** Christ as the second Adam; reversal of Adam's covenantal failure by Christ's representative obedience.
- **Pauline exegesis (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15):** Text-critical and syntactical reading showing Paul presupposes a historical Adam for theological argument.
- **Canonical coherence:** Use of Old and New Testament harmony to argue against fragmentary or literary-only readings of Adam.
- **Representative solidarity:** The social-corporate reality linking the head and the many, used to explain collective imputation.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic:** Reading Scripture with priority given to Christological fulfillment as the key to Old Testament and Pauline claims.
- **Methodological restraint:** Preference for grammatical-historical exegesis and theological consistency over speculative harmonizations with scientific models.
- **Archetypal/ literary Adam (contrast):** Non-historical understandings treated and refuted as inconsistent with Pauline theology.
- **Theistic evolution (interface):** Scientific proposal often in conflict with confessional readings; Gaffin addresses theological implications rather than detailed scientific claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 in service of doctrine.
- As a **polemic resource** against non-historical or purely literary interpretations of Adam.
- As a **definition source** for teaching federal headship, imputation, and the necessity of a historical Adam in systematic theology.
