### TITLE
The Christian Faith and the Church (Secondary Discussions) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 19th century Germany (Der christliche Glaube, 1821/22); situated in post‑Enlightenment, Romantic, and post‑Kantian theology. Schleiermacher aims to mediate between Enlightenment rationalism and confessional orthodoxy; the "secondary discussions" refine ecclesial, sacramental, and eschatological questions treated after his core dogmatics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** How to conceive the Church, sacraments, and related doctrines (including the place of Israel and Romans 11) within a theological system that defines religion as the feeling of absolute dependence rather than as propositional metaphysics.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Religion is *religious self‑consciousness* (feeling of absolute dependence); doctrine explicates this religious experience.
 - The Church is the historical, ethical, and liturgical realization of the Christian consciousness - a community cultivating and transmitting religious feeling.
 - Sacraments, ministry, creeds, and eschatology are secondary institutions that serve the vocation of the Church to maintain Christian piety.
 - On Israel/Romans 11: Paul's language of election and future fulness is read primarily in spiritual / ecclesial terms - national Israel's role is subsumed under the historical movement of revelation culminating in Christ and the Church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Kantian epistemology (critical philosophy), Romantic sensibilities (Herder), contemporary biblical scholarship (Hofmann, Baur debates later), and polemics with orthodox scholasticism and Enlightenment deism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (as religious consciousness and historical divine action), ecclesiology (nature and function of the Church), Christology (mediator of religious feeling), soteriology (participation in Christ's piety), sacraments (means of communal piety), and eschatology (including interpretation of Romans 11 and Israel's future).
- **Closing line:** Schleiermacher's secondary discussions recast the Church and related doctrines as institutional expressions and sustainers of the Christian mode of religious consciousness, reading Israel's place in Romans 11 as ultimately fulfilled and reinterpreted within the life of the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Places *piety* and religious feeling at the center; institutions are valuable insofar as they cultivate this consciousness.
 - Ecclesiology is normative‑ethical: the Church is an ethical community sustained by worship and mutually formative relations rather than primarily a juridical covenant body.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects scholastic metaphysical accounts of atonement and juridical election; opposes a narrowly propositional or legalistic view of the Church and sacraments.
 - Counters Enlightenment reductionism by rescuing the reality of religious experience from mere moralism or pure reason.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Translates classical dogmatic terms into categories of *feeling*, *consciousness*, and *community* (e.g., "revelation" as divine self‑awareness in human piety).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Deeply formative for modern liberal Protestantism, historical‑critical exegesis, and subsequent theological methodologies that prioritize experience and church life.
 - Provoked sustained critique by confessional and conservative theologians; later appropriation and revision by figures seeking to mediate faith and modernity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models a programmatic attempt to integrate biblical interpretation, ecclesiology, and theology with post‑Kantian philosophy.
 - Offers a resilient framework for treating Romans 11 and Israel that highlights theological reinterpretation over political or nationalist readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious self‑consciousness (Gefuhl der Abhaengigkeit):** Core category - piety as the immediate awareness of dependence on the divine.
- **Church as ethical community:** Church functions as formative community where religious consciousness is cultivated.
- **Revelation (as communion):** Not mere information but relational disclosure realized in human religious life and history.
- **Christ as mediator of feeling:** Christ's role is to actualize and perfect the Christian consciousness; emphasis on communion rather than metaphysical substitution.
- **Sacraments as means of piety:** Rituals that embody and foster the Church's religious life, not abstract guarantees of grace.
- **Doctrine vs. religious experience:** Doctrine explicates and systematizes the content of piety; it is secondary to experiential priority.
- **Election (spiritualized):** Election read in existential/ethical terms - God's saving action realized in the churchly remnant, not as narrow national privilege.
- **Romans 11 / Israel's future:** Interprets Paul's promise of future fulness primarily as the eventual ecclesial inclusion and transformation of Israel within the history of revelation; resists literalist national restoration readings.
- **Eschatological fulfillment:** Future consummation is theological/communal - the perfected life of Christian consciousness in the kingdom, not necessarily geopolitical restoration.
- **Worship/Word distinction:** Worship (liturgical life) and the Word serve to sustain the religious sense; creeds function as ecclesial memory rather than metaphysical dogmas.
- **Historical mediation:** Emphasizes historical development as the arena where revelation and church identity are realized.
- **Remnant concept:** Paul's "remnant" read as the faithful within history who embody divine purpose in the Church.
- **Moral‑historical hermeneutic:** Scripture and prophetic promises are read through an ethical and communal interpretive lens.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for modern liberal or pietistic readings of doctrine and ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** against scholastic/civilizational readings of election, sacraments, and church power.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Romans 11 that emphasizes spiritual/eccle­sial fulfillment of Israel's future.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on theology and modernity, illustrating how experiential categories reshape classical dogma.
