### TITLE
The Lord's Supper as a Sign and Seal - Vern Poythress (essay in The Lord's Supper: Remembering and Proclaiming Christ Until He Comes, ed. Mathison)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed scholarship addressing Eucharistic theology within late 20th / early 21st-century confessional renewal.
 - Situated against ongoing debates: Roman Catholic real presence/transubstantiation, Lutheran sacramental union, Zwinglian memorialism, and intra-Reformed concerns about pastoral practice.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Lord's Supper must be understood primarily as a *sign* (representational, communicative) and a *seal* (covenantal assurance), functions that clarify both Christ's presence at the meal and the sacrament's efficacy without collapsing into either purely memorialist or magical/automatic views of grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify terminology: distinguish semiotic categories (sign vs. seal) and theological categories (representation, presence, assurance).
 - Show how the Supper functions sacramentally within covenant theology:
 - As a *sign* it depicts Christ's body and blood and the benefits of his work.
 - As a *seal* it confirms and strengthens the believer's assurance of covenant promises.
 - Defend a Reformed account of Christ's presence:
 - Reject corporal/locative presence (Romanist), and argue for a real but *spiritual* presence mediated by the Spirit and the word.
 - Apply to church practice:
 - Implications for fencing/admission: sacrament presupposes covenant membership and faith; discipline protects the sacrament's sign/seal function and protects communicants from judgment.
 - Cross-apply to baptism:
 - Demonstrates continuity in sacramental logic (initiation vs. sustenance) and addresses questions about mode, infant inclusion, and efficacy as covenantal sign/seal rather than automatic impartation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed confessional sources (Westminster Standards, Heidelberg Catechism); Calvin's sacramental exegesis; contrasts with Luther, Zwingli, and later Roman Catholic formulations; contemporary Reformed interlocutors on admission and pastoral practice.
 - Philosophical-linguistic resources (semiotics of sign/seal) used to sharpen theological categories.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramentology, covenant theology, Christology (presence and mediation), pneumatology (Spirit's role in making Christ present), ecclesiology (discipline, membership), soteriology (assurance).
- **Closing line**
 - Poythress centers the Lord's Supper as a covenantal communicative act: a dual-function sacrament that depicts Christ and confirms covenant trust, thereby safeguarding both faithful presence and prudent pastoral fencing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Terminological clarity:** Robust use of *sign* vs *seal* to prevent category mistakes that lead either to memorialism or magical sacramentarianism.
- **Covenantal stress:** Links Eucharist tightly to covenant membership-supper as sustenance for covenant members, complementary to baptism's initiating sign.
- **Epistemic emphasis:** Treats the sacrament as a means of *assurance*-not as automatic conferral of grace but as God's communicative act that confirms promises to faith.
- **Presence doctrine:** Advocates a Reformed *real, spiritual presence* mediated by the Spirit and the Word, resisting both corporeal presence and purely symbolic interpretations.
- **Pastoral application:** Uses sign/seal logic to justify fencing and admission: discipline preserves the sacrament's communicative integrity and protects participants from judgment.
- **Correction/contrast:** Corrects Zwinglian reductionism (mere memorial) and Romanist confessionalism (automatic effect), offering a middle way that preserves mystery without sacramentalism.
- **Influence:** Valued in contemporary Reformed circles as clarifying confessional sacramentology and shaping pastoral polity debates about who may partake.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a teachable catechetical framework tying doctrine, worship practice, and pastoral discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign** - Represents or points to Christ and his benefits; primarily referential/depictive.
- **Seal** - Confirms and secures God's promise; functions epistemically to strengthen assurance.
- **Representation** - How the elements depict the realities of Christ's atonement.
- **Real (spiritual) presence** - Christ truly present by the Spirit and Word, not corporeally localized.
- **Instrumental efficacy** - Sacraments as instruments that confirm grace to faith, not automatic causes (contra ex opere operato).
- **Covenant sign** - Sacrament as marker of covenant relationship (baptism initiates; Supper sustains).
- **Assurance** - The psychological/theological confidence imparted by the seal function.
- **Fencing / admission** - Ecclesial discipline and criteria for participation; a pastoral safeguard of the sacrament's meaning.
- **Infant baptism** - Treated as a covenant sign; efficacy understood in covenantal, not automatic, terms; parallels with Lord's Supper logic for membership.
- **Believers' baptism** - Emphasizes professing faith as normative for admission where tradition requires profession.
- **Mode (immersion/sprinkling)** - Peripheral to the sign/seal function; Poythress focuses on meaning over mode while recognizing liturgical/covenantal implications.
- **Anamnesis / proclamation** - Supper as proclamation (kerygma) that makes Christ's saving acts present in memory and effect.
- **Efficacy (sacramental)** - Distinguishes God's promise-confirming action from mechanical impartation of grace.
- **Admission criteria** - Theological justification for regulating access to the Supper in line with covenant membership and pastoral care.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental theology (clear sign/seal taxonomy).
 - As a **polemic resource** against both memorialist and transubstantiation claims.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for church discipline, admission, and catechesis linking baptismal initiation and Eucharistic participation.
