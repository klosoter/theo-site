### TITLE
The Holy Spirit in the New Testament - Craig S. Keener

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Produced within contemporary evangelical New Testament scholarship; Keener writes as an academically rigorous, broadly evangelical scholar with sympathetic interest in charismatic phenomena.
 - Methodological milieu: historical-contextual exegesis with wide use of Jewish and Greco-Roman background literature, intertextual and socio-rhetorical reading of NT texts.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The NT presents the Spirit as a full, coherent, personal divine agent whose presence and activity are central to Jesus' ministry, the life and mission of the church, and the continuity of God's covenant work; careful historical exegesis recovers the NT vision against reductionist or anachronistic reconstructions.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close, passage-by-passage exegesis across Gospels, Acts, Paul, Johannine writings, and the General Epistles to reconstruct first-century pneumatology.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the Spirit's identity and persons (pneuma as personal and divine agent in NT contexts).
 - Trace Spirit themes in Jesus' ministry (empowerment, prophetic fulfillment, anointing).
 - Follow the Spirit in Acts as the dynamic presence founding and guiding the church (baptism, gifts, mission).
 - Systematically treat Pauline and Johannine pneumatology (Spirit and justification, Spirit and union with Christ, Spirit and Paraclete).
 - Address Spirit-related practices and controversies (gifts, prophecy, healing) and their theological implications for revelation and ecclesiology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages the NT corpus closely and dialogues with a wide range of scholarship (contemporary commentaries and pneumatology specialists) and with early Jewish, Septuagintal, Dead Sea, and Greco-Roman materials to illuminate usage and background.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, Trinity (implicit and explicit), Christology (Spirit-Christ relation), revelation and inspiration, ecclesiology (baptism, gifts, order), soteriology (regeneration and sanctification), eschatology (Spirit as sign of the age to come).

- **Closing line**
 - The NT's portrait of the Holy Spirit is comprehensive and active: the Spirit is the divine agent who inaugurates and sustains the new covenant people, empowering Jesus and the church for mission, holiness, and witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Exceptional breadth of ancient contextual material-Keener draws widely from Jewish and Greco-Roman texts to illuminate NT usage.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial sensitivity: balances academic exegesis with implications for church practice, especially regarding gifts and Spirit baptism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both reductionist secular readings that minimize the Spirit and rigid cessationist readings that limit Spirit-activity to the apostolic era; argues for historically grounded, text-sensitive continuity of Spirit ministry.
 - More empirically grounded and descriptive than purely systematic-theological accounts that impose later doctrinal categories on NT texts.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes nuanced semantic ranges of core pneumatological terms (pneuma, parakletos, charismata) in their first-century contexts rather than assuming later theological definitions.
 - Frames Spirit-activity as a matrix connecting Christ, Scripture, and community life rather than isolated phenomena.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among evangelicals and pastors as a go-to exegetical resource on NT pneumatology; influential in debates over continuationism vs. cessationism.
 - Reformed and confessional readers often use Keener for historical and textual data while reserving judgment on his openness to ongoing charismatic practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a comprehensive, contextually rich reference that models disciplined exegetical engagement with pneumatology and connects biblical study to ecclesial practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneuma (Spirit)** - central term; treated as personal divine agent in NT contexts.
- **Paraclete** - Johannine term for Spirit as advocate/comforter; Keener highlights relational and revelatory functions.
- **Charismata (gifts)** - analyzed in usage, function, and regulation across NT corpora; argued historically plausible as ongoing when exercised biblically.
- **Baptism in the Spirit** - initiation motif linking believers into Christ and the church; distinguished from water baptism in function and theological import.
- **Spirit of Christ / Spirit of God** - relational language linking Spirit activity to Christology and divine agency; used to trace continuity between Jesus and the post-resurrection community.
- **Inspiration / Revelation** - Spirit as the agent of prophetic and apostolic witness; treated with historical sensitivity to NT claims rather than later dogmatic formulations.
- **Spirit and mission** - Spirit empowers proclamation and crosses cultural-religious boundaries in Acts and Pauline mission.
- **Spirit and ethics / sanctification** - ethical fruits and transformation as integral markers of Spirit presence.
- **Spirit and eschatology** - Spirit as present down-payment of eschatological renewal and resurrection life.
- **Pneumatological vocabulary** - Keener emphasizes semantic range over static definition; context-driven interpretation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar of historically grounded, context-rich reading of pneumatological texts.
 - As a **definition source**: reliable survey of NT meanings for key pneumatological terms.
 - As a **polemic resource**: frequently cited in debates over charismatic continuationism, supplying textual warrants and historical analogies.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating Christology, ecclesiology, and mission around Spirit-centered readings of the NT.
