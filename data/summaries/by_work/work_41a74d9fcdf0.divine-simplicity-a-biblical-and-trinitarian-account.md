### TITLE
**Divine Simplicity: A Biblical and Trinitarian Account** 
Paul R. Hinlicky

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Situated in late 20th / early 21st-century debates over the doctrine of God that bring analytic metaphysics, historical theology, and biblical scholarship into conversation. 
 - Responds to both classical theistic (Thomistic/Aquinian) accounts and recent analytic critiques that treat divine simplicity as metaphysically implausible or theologically problematic. 
 - Writes from a confessional Protestant (Lutheran) vantage attentive to Scripture and Trinitarian tradition.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To defend a credible doctrine of divine simplicity that is faithful to biblical revelation and coherent with orthodox Trinitarian doctrine, while avoiding the chief pitfalls of reductive metaphysical renderings of simplicity.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnose: classical formulations of divine simplicity (CDS) often abstract God into an undifferentiated metaphysical substrate or collapse relational distinctions implied by Trinitarian language. 
 - Exegetical anchoring: read biblical texts on God, revelation, and the Son/Spirit to show that simplicity must be interpreted in light of God's tri-personal self-revelation. 
 - Theological correction: propose a Trinitarian-inflected account of simplicity that preserves unity without erasing persona and relationality; attributes are not additional parts but ways the one divine life is spoken of. 
 - Philosophical clarification: reframe metaphysical commitments so that simplicity is not a demand for ontological homogeneity but for the undivided life of God expressed in three persons.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Classical fathers and medievals (Augustine, Aquinas) as historical resources and targets for reinterpretation. 
 - Modern analytic and continental interlocutors-those who reject CDS on metaphysical grounds-as well as contemporary Trinitarianists who emphasize persons (e.g., Barthian and post-Barthian streams). 
 - Primary recourse to Scripture and to patristic/traditional vocabularies (perichoresis, ousia, hypostasis).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Divine simplicity, Trinity (immanent and economic), attributes of God (unity, aseity, immutability), revelation and biblical theology, Christology insofar as the Son reveals the Father.

- **Closing line:** 
 - A proposal that divine simplicity must be reclaimed as a biblical, Trinitarian doctrine: simplicity describes the undivided divine life disclosed in three persons, resisting both metaphysical atomization and person-diminishing abstractions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Centers **biblical revelation and Trinitarian self-disclosure** as corrective to purely metaphysical accounts of simplicity. 
 - Treats attributes as **inseparable appropriations** of a single divine life rather than as added properties or accidental features.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Critiques Thomistic tendencies that risk collapsing relational distinctions when pressed into strict metaphysical simplicity. 
 - Opposes reductive analytic rejections that dismiss simplicity as incoherent by showing how a Trinitarian reading avoids the principal paradoxes.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reframes simplicity in relational and perichoretic language: simplicity as **personal undividedness** rather than mere metaphysical indivisibility. 
 - Emphasizes the primacy of economic revelation for metaphysical statements about God's inner life.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Used by theologians seeking a middle path between classical Thomism and anti-metaphysical critiques; noticed in Protestant and ecumenical conversations on God-language. 
 - Cited in discussions about the compatibility of classical attributes with a robust Trinitarian theology.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a pedagogically useful corrective that keeps Scripture and Trinitarian doctrine central when teaching divine attributes. 
 - Provokes careful reconsideration of how metaphysics and exegesis must inform one another in theology of God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine simplicity (biblical/Trinitarian sense):** the claim that God's being is undivided and non-composite, articulated so as to account for the Father, Son, and Spirit without metaphysical reductionism. 
- **Classical Divine Simplicity (CDS):** traditional Thomistic-like thesis that God has no parts or accidents; treated critically and reinterpreted. 
- **Perichoresis:** mutual indwelling of the persons of the Trinity; used to articulate relational unity without confusion. 
- **Ousia / Hypostasis:** substance and persons vocabulary; distinguished carefully to defend personal distinctions within ontological unity. 
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity:** the priority of revelation (economic) for claims about the immanent (inner) life; economy grounds metaphysical talk. 
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; retained but read through a Trinitarian relationality that qualifies self-sufficiency as interpersonal life. 
- **Attributes (inseparable vs. separable):** attributes are inseparable ways of speaking about the one divine life; rejects treating them as additive parts. 
- **Immutability & Impassibility:** affirmed but reframed to account for the life of divine persons who relate and act without change in essence. 
- **Analogia entis / analogy of being:** caution against simplistic analogical transfers; promotes a Trinitarian-informed analogical approach. 
- **Apophatic theology:** invoked to restrain metaphysical overreach and to respect the mystery of divine being as disclosed by Scripture. 
- **Relational simplicity:** Hinlicky's preferred language to show unity accomplished in interpersonal divine life rather than mere metaphysical indivisibility. 
- **Revelation-first metaphysics:** methodological principle: biblical testimony constrains ontological claims about God.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for Trinitarian-friendly accounts of simplicity in doctrine of God courses. 
 - As a **polemic** against reductive readings of classical simplicity and anti-metaphysical dismissals. 
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how Scripture guides metaphysical theology about God. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates reconciling classical attributes with contemporary Trinitarian theology.
