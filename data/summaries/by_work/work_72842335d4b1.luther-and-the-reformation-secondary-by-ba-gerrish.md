### TITLE
Luther and the Reformation (secondary study by B. A. Gerrish) - reading Martin Luther through the Augustinian / anti‑Pelagian controversy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 16th century Reformation in the Holy Roman Empire: humanist renewal, late‑medieval scholasticism, indulgence controversy.
 - Gerrish (20th century historian/theologian) locates Luther within the long Augustinian tradition and as a corrective to late medieval tendencies that bordered on semi‑Pelagianism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Luther's core theological move is to reclaim **Augustinian monergism** (God as sole actor in salvation) against theological positions that allow human cooperation (Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian tendencies). For Gerrish, Luther's theology is primarily a rearticulation of the problem of grace, sin, and justification.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis of medieval theology: moralism, sacramental merit, and cooperation language that dilute divine grace.
 - Return to Pauline and Augustinian emphases: radical sin, bondage of the will, necessity of sovereign grace.
 - Doctrinal outcome: justification as God's declarative act (forensic), sola fide and sola gratia, reformed eucharistic and sacramental practice as means of grace rather than merit.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial consequences: preaching as primary locus of revelation (law/gospel distinction), critique of ecclesiastical abuses (indulgences, penance).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary theological foils: Pelagius and semi‑Pelagian formulations (as typologies), Erasmus (on free will), late scholastic Thomists and pastoral theologians.
 - Central inheritance: Augustine and Pauline epistles (especially Romans and Galatians).
 - Gerrish reads Luther's early and mature writings (bondage of the will debates, sermons, catechetical works).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (total/deepened sense of sin), soteriology (monergism vs. synergism), justification (forensic imputation), grace, sacraments, law and gospel, ecclesiology (preaching and office).
- **Closing line**
 - Gerrish presents Luther theologically as the Augustinian revivalist who recenters salvation as God's unilateral, gracious act against any anthropology that posits human merit or cooperative initiation in salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses **bondage of the will** and the inability of unaided human nature to move toward God; thus grace is wholly initiating and decisive.
 - Highlights Luther's sustained pastoral imagination: doctrine is formed to address guilt, assurance, and God's comfort.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts Luther with semi‑Pelagian tendencies in late medieval pastoral theology that presupposed human cooperation or prevenient merits.
 - Marks divergence from Erasmus: where Erasmus posits a cooperative account of will and grace, Luther affirms radical dependence on divine efficacious grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reassertion and popularization of **law/gospel** dichotomy as key hermeneutical tool.
 - Consolidation of the language of **forensic justification** and **imputed righteousness** in polemic and catechesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Gerrish shows how Luther's Augustinianism shaped both Lutheran identity and provided a template (with modifications) for Reformed responses; sparked centuries of debate over imputation vs. infusion, forensic vs. participatory views.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for teaching the theological logic connecting sin, grace, and assurance.
 - Serves as a concise model for reading Luther as a corrective to medieval moralism and as a pastoral theologian whose doctrines aim to relieve conscience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism**
 - Denial of original sin's totality; human will capable of initiating salvation. Luther opposed as an error that undercuts need for divine grace.
- **Semi‑Pelagianism**
 - View that human will makes the first move toward God and grace cooperates. Gerrish reads Luther as primarily reacting against this posture in pastoral theology.
- **Augustinianism**
 - Emphasis on divine initiative, original sin, and sovereign grace; the primary historical matrix Gerrish attributes to Luther.
- **Original sin**
 - Radical corruption of will and nature; basis for Luther's insistence on monergistic grace.
- **Bondage of the will (servitus voluntatis)**
 - Luther's claim that unregenerate will is bound to sin and incapable of choosing God without God's irresistible grace.
- **Monergism**
 - Salvation as solely the work of God; key to Luther's soteriology as interpreted by Gerrish.
- **Synergism**
 - Any theology that assigns initiating causal efficacy to human will; opposed by Luther.
- **Justification (forensic)**
 - God's declarative act that imputes Christ's righteousness to the believer; central in Gerrish's reading of Luther.
- **Imputed righteousness**
 - Christ's righteousness accounted to believers, distinct from infused or inherent righteousness.
- **Sola fide / sola gratia**
 - Justification by faith alone and grace alone; theological slogans summarizing Luther's corrective to merit theology.
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Hermeneutical polarity: law condemns and shows need; gospel frees and grants forgiveness.
- **Means of grace**
 - Preaching, sacraments as God‑worked instruments of grace rather than human merit accumulators.
- **Indulgences / penitential system**
 - Target of Luther's critique; illustrative of the clericalized merit economy he rejects.
- **Assurance / consolation**
 - Pastoral objective: doctrine must deliver assurance of forgiveness and life in Christ.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: frames Luther as an Augustinian monergist for systematic loci on soteriology.
 - Polemic: used as a classic polemical template against semi‑Pelagian and merit‑based accounts of salvation.
 - Exegetical model: grounds Pauline exegesis (Romans/Galatians) in a pastoral, anti‑merit key.
 - Conceptual pivot: serves as a pivot in historical theology courses to trace the shift from medieval sacramentalism to Protestant forensic soteriology.
