### TITLE
The Teaching of Jesus Concerning the Holy Spirit - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton/Reformed milieu; Vos as founder of modern Reformed biblical theology at Princeton Seminary.
 - Reaction to theological liberalism and reductionist accounts of the Spirit; placed within Vos's broader program of redemptive-historical exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus' own instruction presents the Holy Spirit as a **personal, divine, eschatological gift** who continues Christ's presence and mission; this teaching must be understood within the unfolding redemptive-historical plan rather than as mere ethical influence or vague spiritual force.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical focus on Gospel passages (notably Johannine discourses and Synoptic sayings) to reconstruct Jesus' pneumatology.
 - Demonstrates that Jesus speaks of the Spirit with personal predicates (teaching, testifying, guiding) and relational predicates (sent from the Father in Jesus' name).
 - Locates the Spirit as the fulfillment of OT prophetic promises and as the inaugurator of the new covenant age (eschatological gift).
 - Shows the Spirit's functions: revelation (remembrance and guidance into truth), sanctification (indwelling, renewal), empowerment for witness/mission.
 - Theological synthesis: the Spirit is distinct in personhood yet fully in communion with Father and Son - serving as the mediatorial presence of Christ in the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary texts: Gospel of John (14-16), Synoptic traditions about the Spirit, OT prophetic texts (Joel, Ezekiel, Isaiah).
 - Implicit interlocutors: rationalist and philosophical reductions of the Spirit (Spirit as force/inspiration), pietistic subjectivism, and modalistic/ontological misunderstandings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (personhood and deity of the Spirit), revelation, eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), Christology (continuing Christic presence), covenant/new covenant, sanctification, mission.
- **Closing line**
 - Jesus teaches the Holy Spirit to be the promised, personal, divine agent who inaugurates the eschatological new covenant and perpetuates Christ's presence, revelation, and mission in the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Redemptive-historical reading: Vos situates Jesus' pneumatology as fulfillment of OT prophecy and as a decisive eschatological turn rather than merely ethical or institutional teaching.
 - Priority of Jesus' own words: reconstructs pneumatology primarily from the sayings of Jesus (not later church formulations).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects the reduction of the Spirit to impersonal "influence" (common in rationalist circles).
 - Counters pietistic subjectivism that divorces Spirit's objective, revelatory functions in favor of vague inner feeling.
 - Avoids speculative metaphysics; grounds pneumatology in Scripture and redemptive history.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Stresses the Spirit as the mediatorial continuation of Christ - a conceptual bridge between Christology and pneumatology that highlights functional continuity without collapse of persons.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed circles as a model for biblically centered pneumatology; used by subsequent Reformed theologians to defend orthodox views of Spirit's personhood and deity.
 - Valued in broader evangelical scholarship for its careful exegesis and historical-theological framing.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as exemplar for integrating exegesis, redemptive-historical method, and doctrinal clarity regarding the Spirit.
 - Useful corrective to both liberal reductionism and non-discursive charismatic excesses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneuma (Spirit)** - Vos treats the term as personal and active, not merely an impersonal force.
- **Paraclete** - Emphasized as the promised Advocate/Comforter who represents and continues Christ's work.
- **Personhood** - Attributes like teaching, witnessing, guiding are taken as indicators of personhood.
- **Deity** - Vos reads Jesus' language to imply divine status for the Spirit in unity with Father and Son.
- **Eschatological Gift** - The Spirit as the inaugurated fulfillment of OT prophecy and sign of the new covenant age.
- **Indwelling** - The Spirit's abiding presence in believers as the locus of sanctification and continuity of Christ's presence.
- **Revelation** - Function of the Spirit to recall Jesus' words, guide into truth, and bear witness to Christ.
- **Sanctification / Renewal** - Spirit as agent of internal renewal and ethical transformation.
- **Mission / Witness** - Spirit empowers the church for testimony and mission; sentness parallels Son's sending.
- **Unity-in-Trinity** - Functional distinctions among persons without ontological division; Spirit acts in concert with Father and Son.
- **Parallels with OT prophecy** - Spirit as fulfillment of Joel, Ezekiel, and prophetic outpourings.
- **Mediator/Continuation** - Conceptual phrase for how Spirit continues the mediatorial office of Christ.
- **Sentness (Apostolic motif)** - Emphasis on Spirit's sending akin to Son's sending, underscoring relational economy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the person and deity of the Holy Spirit in Reformed theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Synoptic teachings on the Spirit within redemptive history.
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist or overly subjective accounts of the Spirit.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, eschatology, and pneumatology in systematic reflection.
