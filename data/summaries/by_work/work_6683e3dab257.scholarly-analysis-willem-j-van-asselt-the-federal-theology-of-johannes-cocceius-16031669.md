### TITLE
Willem J. van Asselt, The Federal Theology of Johannes Cocceius (1603-1669) - scholarly analysis of Cocceius's covenantal system and its theological-historical reception.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th-century Dutch Reformed milieu; post-Trent confessional Europe and the Dutch Golden Age.
 - Cocceius operates at the interface of Reformed scholasticism, Ramist exegetical habits, and an emerging biblical-historical method (historia salutis).
 - Van Asselt treats Cocceius as a formative figure for later covenant theology in the Dutch tradition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Asselt contends that Cocceius reframes Reformed theology by making covenant (foedus) the central organizing principle: theology as a historical, Christ-centered unfolding of divine covenantal acts rather than primarily a set of static scholastic propositions.
 - The study addresses how Cocceius conceptualizes intra-trinitarian and historical covenants (notably the Covenant of Redemption and the Covenant of Grace) and how that reshapes confession and dogmatic method.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expository reconstruction of Cocceius's key texts and lectures to recover his systematic shape.
 - Traces methodological commitments: biblical-historical reading, typology, promise-fulfillment schema, and polemics against Voetian scholasticism.
 - Demonstrates how Cocceius:
 - posits a sequence of covenants as the backbone of salvation history;
 - centers Christ as the telos and mediator of covenantal promises;
 - develops distinct doctrines of promise, sign and sacrament (baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenantal seals).
 - Concludes with reception-history: the internal Cocceian school, Dutch Reformed confessional practice, and later appropriations.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Johannes Cocceius (1603-1669) - lectures, sermons, commentaries.
 - Interlocutors: Voetian scholastics (e.g., Gisbertus Voetius), earlier covenant theologians (Calvin, Beza), and contemporaries in the Dutch university context.
 - Methodologically attentive to manuscript material and confessional documents.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (structure and taxonomy), Christology and mediation, revelation and typology, sacraments as covenant signs, soteriology across historia salutis, Trinitarian relations insofar as they ground the Covenant of Redemption.
 - Also touches ecclesiology and the confessional reception of covenantal language.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Cocceius, as Van Asselt shows, relocates Reformed dogmatics into a Christ‑centered, historico‑covenantal framework in which redemptive history and intra‑Trinitarian pact-thinking reorder doctrine and confessional expression.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the *historical* progression of covenants (promise -> fulfillment) as the primary hermeneutical key.
 - Christologically driven reading of Scripture: typology is normative for doctrinal formulation.
 - Integration of covenant signs and eschatological consummation - sacraments are forward- and backward-looking within covenant history.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors and rivals**
 - Pushes back against Voetian scholasticism that privileges abstract juridical definitions; Cocceius privileges covenantal acts and promises.
 - Modifies classical forensic emphases by embedding justification and election within an unfolding covenantal story.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic employment of the *Covenant of Redemption* (intra‑Trinitarian pact) as an organizing dogmatic notion.
 - Recourse to *historia salutis* as both exegetical method and doctrinal architecture rather than mere chronology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Polarizing in the Dutch context: spawned a distinct Cocceian school and long debates with Voetians.
 - Influential for later Dutch covenantal piety, for certain strands of Pietism, and for modern Reformed covenant theology and scholarship.
 - Reappraised by contemporary historians (including Van Asselt) as a coherent theological project rather than a merely exegetical curiosity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a paradigmatic model for integrating biblical exegesis with dogmatic structure.
 - Offers resources for contemporary debates on the Covenant of Redemption and for interpreting confessional language about covenants.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (foedus)** - the central organizing category in Cocceius: relational, historical, and Christ‑mediated.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - intra‑Trinitarian agreement by which the Son assumes the work of mediation; for Van Asselt, Cocceius gives this a clearer systematic role.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace** - classical federal categories, reinterpreted within Cocceius's historical succession and typology.
- **Historia salutis (salvation history)** - method: Scripture interpreted as a coherent sequence of redemptive acts and promises.
- **Typology** - normative hermeneutic: Old Testament types point to Christ and covenantal fulfillment.
- **Sacraments as covenant signs** - baptism and Eucharist function as seals and pledges within the covenantal economy.
- **Christocentric dogmatics** - doctrinal loci are organized around Christ as covenant mediator and telos.
- **Forensic vs. historical emphasis** - Cocceius shifts from a primarily forensic (legal) model to a historical‑narrative model.
- **Trinitarian pact-thinking** - use of intra‑divine relations to ground soteriological commitments.
- **Confessional Formulations of Covenant** - Van Asselt traces how Cocceian language affected subsequent articulations in Dutch confessional practice and contested confessional formulations.
- **Exegetical polemics** - Cocceius's readings often polemicized against scholastic abstractions and aimed to realign confessional teaching with biblical history.
- **Eschatological consummation** - covenantal promises culminate in an inaugurated yet future consummation (already/not‑yet).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source:** Scholars and teachers cite Van Asselt on how Cocceius defines and locates the Covenant of Redemption within Reformed dogmatics.
 - **Polemic resource:** Used to understand historical controversies over confessional formulations of covenant language in the Dutch Reformed churches.
 - **Exegetical model:** Employed as a model for recasting doctrinal loci along historico‑covenantal lines rather than strictly scholastic categories.
