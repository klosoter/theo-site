### TITLE
God's Word in Human Words - Kenton L. Sparks

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical academy (early 21st century). Written within a milieu pressing for an evangelical rapprochement with mainstream historical-critical biblical scholarship; aimed at seminary students, pastors, and lay evangelicals wary of critical methods.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture is both divine and human communication: God speaks through historically situated human authors. A robust evangelical doctrine of Scripture should accept results of critical scholarship (authorship, redaction, genre, historical conditioning) while maintaining theological authority and trustworthiness.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnostic stage: surveys tensions between conservative inerrantist readings and critical-historical conclusions that reveal human contingency in the texts.
 - Exegetical-historical stage: demonstrates how the Bible itself bears marks of human authorship (genre, development, editorial layers) and how ancient communicative practices shape the texts.
 - Theological reconstruction: proposes a model of inspiration that is neither mechanical dictation nor naive subjectivism - Scripture as God's speech enacted through human authors (accommodation/synergy).
 - Methodological proposals: integrate historical-critical tools into theological reading, preserve canonical and communal interpretive practices, and protect normative authority by locating trust in divine intention and redemptive trajectory, not in textural perfection.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Engages broadly with historical-critical scholars and methods (textual criticism, source and redaction criticism, form criticism).
 - Dialogues with evangelical interlocutors who defend classical inerrancy, as well as with proponents of canonical and confessional approaches (implicit contrasts with both liberal higher criticism and strict verbal-plenary models).
 - Draws on biblical evidence, ancient Near Eastern context, and contemporary hermeneutical theory.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, authority and inerrancy of Scripture, canon and canonicity, hermeneutics, biblical theology; touches on implications for ecclesial reception and pastoral trust.
- **Closing line:** Sparks argues for a theologically responsible middle path: acknowledge the Bible's human contours as integral to God's communicative act, thereby preserving divine authoritativeness without denying critical-historical findings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *historicity and human mediation* of biblical texts as constructive for theology rather than as fatal to authority.
 - Presents inspiration as *divine-human synergy* - God intends and accomplishes revelation through the specificities of human minds, languages, and cultures.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects naïve inerrantist models that treat the Bible as unmediated divine dictation by arguing that such models conflict with both textual evidence and sound hermeneutics.
 - Counters radical critical skepticism by arguing that historical-critical discoveries need not erode theological confidence; they often enrich theological reading.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematizes the phrase "God's Word in human words" as a compact way to hold together divine origin and human form.
 - Frames reception authority in terms of *intentional divine action* rather than textual perfection.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used among moderate and academic evangelicals as a bridge text; welcomed in seminary curricula that aim to reconcile faith commitments with critical methods.
 - Criticized by strict inerrantist camps as insufficiently protective of textual perfection; sometimes seen by skeptical critics as preserving doctrinal assumptions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a pedagogical model for integrating historical-critical scholarship into confessional teaching.
 - Useful for pastors and educators seeking an intellectually responsible way to teach trust in Scripture without rejecting mainstream biblical scholarship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accomodation** - God communicating in culturally and historically appropriate human forms; central to Sparks' model.
- **Inspiration (synergistic model)** - Divine inspiration that preserves genuine human agency and linguistic contingency.
- **Two‑authorship language** - shorthand for claiming both divine initiative and human literary agency; used cautiously to avoid bifurcation.
- **Historical‑critical method** - treated as necessary and usable for theological reading rather than intrinsically corrosive.
- **Redaction and editorial processes** - evidence of theological development and communal shaping, not mere corruption.
- **Genre and ancient communicative practices** - focal for interpreting statements about history, theology, and prophecy.
- **Authority (normative trustworthiness)** - grounded in divine intention and redemptive trajectory more than in textual exhaustiveness of factual accuracy.
- **Inerrancy (qualified critique)** - critiqued in absolutist formulations; Sparks urges reframing its aim language toward reliability and theological fidelity.
- **Canonical reading** - employed as the theological or ecclesial lens that follows historical study, not as an alternative to it.
- **Hermeneutical community / confessional reception** - highlights role of church community in sustaining interpretive trust.
- **Authorial intention (pluralized)** - emphasizes historically situated individual authors shaped by tradition and community.
- **Reliability vs. perfection** - distinction used to reframe trust: reliable for salvation and theological truth even amid human features.
- **Pastoral implication** - offers ways to teach Scripture honestly in congregations without fostering doubt.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for an evangelical, critical‑friendly doctrine of Scripture.
- As a **polemic** against dictation models of inspiration and against unqualified rejection of critical methods.
- As an **exegetical model** for combining historical‑critical insights with canonical and theological interpretation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on revelation, hermeneutics, and doctrine of Scripture that aim to integrate scholarship and confessional faith.
