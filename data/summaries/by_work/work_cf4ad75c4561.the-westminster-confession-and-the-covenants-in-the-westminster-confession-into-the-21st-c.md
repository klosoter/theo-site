### TITLE
**The Westminster Confession and the Covenants - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** (in The Westminster Confession into the 21st Century, ed. Ligon Duncan)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed renewal; written by a conservative Presbyterian exegete and systematician addressing how the Westminster Confession (WCF) handles covenant theology in contemporary debate.
 - Moves within confessional Reformed circles reacting to intra-Reformed disputes (Meredith Kline-type readings, New Covenant emphases, credobaptist critiques).
- **Central thesis**
 - The WCF presents a unified, confessional account of the covenant of grace as a single covenant with different administrations; this framework secures proper doctrine of sacraments, baptismal inclusion, means of grace, assurance, and eucharistic practice.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical and confessional reading of WCF formulations: careful attention to terminology such as "covenant," "signs and seals," and "administrations."
 - Defense of covenant continuity: the covenant of grace persists in substance across administrations (promise fulfilled in Christ), avoiding both collapsing into a mere continuity of external rites and a rupture that severs sacramental promise.
 - Sacramental theology grounded in covenantal promise: sacraments are means of grace as seals of the covenant by the Spirit, not merely memorials or merely symbolic signs.
 - Pastoral implications: infant baptism within the visible covenant community; proper fencing and admission to the Lord's Table; assurance rooted objectively in Christ and subjectively in faith's evidences.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Westminster divines and the Confession itself, Calvin and classical Reformed writers, contemporary covenant theologians (implicit engagement with Klinean formulations and Baptist critiques).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant (works and grace), Christology (as Mediator and federal head), sacramentology (baptism and Lord's Supper), means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer), assurance and perseverance, ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, discipline).
- **Site references (selective topical anchors in Gaffin's essay)**
 - Confessional formulations of covenant - Gaffin's reading of WCF covenant language and unity.
 - Baptism: infant vs believer efficacy - defense of infant baptism as sign and seal within covenant.
 - Means of grace: preaching, sacraments, prayer - sacraments functioning as covenantal means.
 - Assurance and perseverance - assurance grounded in covenant promises and Christ's work.
 - Lord's Supper: presence of Christ, fencing and admission - spiritual presence and pastoral gatekeeping.
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin affirms that a confessional covenantal theology, properly understood, secures sacramental efficacy, pastoral discipline, and assurance without collapsing the promises of God into mere external rites.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the *unity* of the covenant of grace as the backbone of the WCF rather than a succession of fundamentally different covenants.
 - Emphasis on sacraments as both sign and seal: objective covenant promise sealed by the Holy Spirit but requiring faith for personal benefit.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects approaches that either (a) minimize the objective efficacy of the covenantal promise tied to sacraments, or (b) overstate continuity to the point of making rites automatically effectual.
 - Counters credobaptist and some New Covenant claims by reintegrating children of the covenant into confessional paedobaptism.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies WCF categories ("administrations" of the one covenant) as a conceptual pivot between promise and pastoral application.
 - Nuances the relation between objective covenantal status and subjective assurance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read and used in conservative Presbyterian and Reformed training; influential in contemporary defenses of confessional paedobaptism and sacramental ministry.
 - Cited in debates over table admission and ecclesial discipline as a confessional standard.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful confessional exegesis linking doctrinal formulations to pastoral sacramental practice; valuable for pastors, presbyters, and systematicians wrestling with covenantal coherence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Single covenant in substance promising Christ and salvation, administered in different forms across redemptive history.
- **Administration(s) of the covenant**
 - The distinct outward economies by which the one covenant is dispensed (e.g., sacramental administrations pre- and post-Christ).
- **Sign and seal**
 - Sacraments function as both visible signs and seals (attesting and confirming the covenant promise).
- **Baptism (infant vs believer)**
 - Infant baptism: inclusion in visible covenant community as sign/seal of promise; efficacy is covenantal and promise-bound, not automatic regeneration.
 - Believer baptism: contrasted in debates; Gaffin argues confessional warrant favors paedobaptism.
- **Means of grace**
 - Preaching, sacraments, and prayer as instruments by which God ordinarily communicates and seals covenant benefits.
- **Assurance (objective vs subjective)**
 - Objective basis: Christ's accomplished work and covenant promises; Subjective evidence: faith, sanctification, and testimony of the Spirit.
- **Perseverance**
 - Covenantally grounded perseverance: sustained by grace and the promise, not by human certainty alone.
- **Visibility / invisibility of the church**
 - Distinction used to justify communion admission discipline and baptismal practice.
- **Lord's Supper: presence of Christ**
 - Affirms a spiritual, real presence received by faith; rejects corporeal presence and purely memorial readings.
- **Fencing the table / admission**
 - Pastoral and ecclesiastical practice of regulating participation based on visible profession and evidence of life in Christ.
- **Seal of the Spirit**
 - The Spirit's confirming work that makes the sacramental promise effectual for believers.
- **Promise vs. sign distinction**
 - Keeps the objective promise (what God has pledged in Christ) distinct from the outward sign (baptism, bread/wine) that communicates and seals it.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional covenant theology and sacramental doctrine.
 - As a **polemic tool** against credobaptist and discontinuity readings of covenant history.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for implementing baptismal practice, Lord's Supper admission, and preaching as means of grace.
