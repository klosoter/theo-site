### TITLE
Articles in the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review - Charles Hodge: "Sacraments as Means of Grace"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Princeton theology; series of articles in the Biblical Repertory and Princeton Review reflecting Hodge's pastoral-systematic stance (1830s-1860s).
 - Reaction to Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Lutheran scholasticism, and Zwinglian memorialism; situated amid debates over revivalism, confessional orthodoxy, and biblical authority.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sacraments are instituted signs and seals of the covenant of grace that, in connection with the Word and the Holy Spirit, are real means by which Christ's promises are applied to believers - not mechanical causes of grace nor mere reminders.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define sacrament: instituted physical sign associated with a promise.
 - Distinguish functions: sign, seal, witness, and means.
 - Rejection of Roman concepts: not efficacious ex opere operato (automatic physical cause) nor a material conferring of Christ's body.
 - Rejection of bare memorialism: sacraments do more than commemorate; they communicate spiritual reality by the Spirit.
 - Instrumentality: sacraments operate instrumentally through the Word and promise; their efficacy depends on the divine promise and the Spirit's operation, ordinarily appropriated by faith.
 - Application to rites:
 - Baptism: sign and seal of incorporation into the covenant; includes infant baptism within covenantal continuity.
 - Lord's Supper: a spiritual feeding on Christ by faith; real spiritual presence mediated by the Spirit, not physical presence of Christ's body.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages patristic and magisterial sources implicitly (Augustine, Calvin) and polemically (Luther, Zwingli, Roman Catholic theologians).
 - Contemporary debate partners: American Presbyterian leaders, revival critics, and confessional advocates.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology, covenant theology, Christology (presence of Christ), pneumatology (Spirit as agent of application), ecclesiology (church as covenant sign community), soteriology (faith and appropriation), Word and sacrament relation.
- **Closing line**
 - Hodge situates sacraments within covenant promise: as sacramental signs the church administers, they are means by which the Spirit, through the Word and faith, applies Christ's redeeming benefits - neither magical nor merely memorial.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the mediatorial role of the Word and divine promise: sacraments never replace the promise but confirm and apply it.
 - Dual focus on **objective** sign/seal and **subjective** appropriation by faith; neither pole alone suffices.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic ex opere operato and transubstantiation by denying automatic physical efficacy and material presence.
 - Counters Zwinglian memorialism by affirming a real spiritual efficacy and presence mediated by the Spirit.
 - Modifies Lutheran language of corporeal presence: affirms spiritual feeding rather than bodily presence in the elements.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of covenant categories to explain sacramental administration and infant baptism; integrates sacramental sign/seal terminology with pneumatic instrumentality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Princeton and conservative American Presbyterian circles; became a staple Reformed articulation taught in seminaries.
 - Provoked critique from Anglo-Catholics and sacramentalists who found him insufficiently sacramental, and from strict memorialists who found him too "realist."
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear pedagogical model for Reformed sacramental theology: balances objective promise and subjective faith, useful for pastoral instruction and confessional defense.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament**
 - Instituted physical sign attached to a divine promise; bearer of covenantal significance.
- **Means of grace**
 - Channels through which God ordinarily communicates saving benefits; sacraments are instrumental among these.
- **Sign and seal**
 - Sign: visible token of an invisible reality; Seal: confirmation of God's promise and claim upon the recipient.
- **Ex opere operato**
 - Roman claim of automatic efficacy; Hodge rejects as incompatible with Reformed emphasis on promise and Spirit.
- **Instrumentality**
 - The sacraments operate as instruments of the Holy Spirit in connection with the Word and promise.
- **Spiritual presence**
 - Christ is truly present in the supper spiritually (not corporeally); communicable by faith through the Spirit.
- **Memorialism**
 - View reducing sacraments to mere remembrance; Hodge critiques for denying objective efficacy.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Framework for understanding sacramental administration, infant baptism, and membership in the church.
- **Infant baptism**
 - Valid within covenantal continuity as sign and seal of inclusion, pending personal faith.
- **Word and Spirit**
 - The normative context for sacramental efficacy; Word announces promise, Spirit applies it.
- **Objective vs subjective efficacy**
 - Objective: the sacrament as a promise-bearing institution; Subjective: appropriated effect in the believer by faith.
- **Real (spiritual) feeding**
 - Language for communion: believers feed on Christ by faith, a real benefit distinct from physical eating.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed sacramental doctrine and catechesis.
 - As polemic material against Roman sacramentalism and Zwinglian memorialism.
 - As an exegetical-covenantal model for preaching and ecclesial practice (baptismal theology, Lord's Supper pastoral application).
