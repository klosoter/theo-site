### TITLE
Intellectual Appetite: A Theological Grammar - Paul J. Griffiths

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Roman Catholic theological conversation recovering pre-modern resources (Augustine, Aquinas) in dialogue with analytic philosophy, virtue epistemology, and moral theology.
 - Positioned against late modern epistemologies that separate cognition from affect and volition; aimed at theologians, philosophers of religion, and ministers concerned with formation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Knowledge is not a purely cognitive product but is shaped by appetites**: intellectual desire (appetitus intelligibilis) governs what and how we come to know God and truth.
 - The problem addressed: modern bifurcation of intellect and will leaves theology ill-equipped to account for conversion, assent, and the moral-spiritual formation required for genuine knowledge of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: traces the impoverishment of theological epistemology when affectivity and desire are neglected; critiques Enlightenment epistemic individualism.
 - Retrieval: rescues a classical grammar (Augustine, Aquinas) in which cognition is integrated with love, appetite, and habituation.
 - Constructive: articulates a *theological grammar* of intellectual appetite that specifies categories, virtues, and practices by which intellectual desire is formed toward truth and God.
 - Practical implications: shows how doctrinal assent, liturgical practice, and moral formation together shape theological knowing.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary retrieval figures: **Augustine** (love-knowledge), **Aquinas** (appetitus intelligibilis), patristic and medieval moral-psychology.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: philosophers and theologians working in virtue epistemology, moral psychology, and theological method (broadly sketched rather than narrowly polemical).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Epistemology of faith (knowledge of God), theological anthropology (soul, will, desire), conversion and sanctification, virtues (intellectual and theological), revelation and its formative role in belief, and implications for ecclesial practice.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **to know God rightly requires the formation of intellectual appetite; theology must be a grammar for the loves that make knowing possible.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places *appetite* (desire, love) at the conceptual center of theological epistemology rather than at its margin.
 - Treats knowledge as morally and spiritually formed, not merely evidentially justified.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern accounts that present belief as a detached cognitive state; contrasts with purely evidentialist and some contemporary virtue-epistemic accounts by insisting on sacramental, ecclesial, and dispositional formation.
 - Offers an internal critique of purely intellectualist Thomisms by recovering affective dynamics in Aquinas and Augustine.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the phrase **"intellectual appetite"** as a technical node linking appetitive psychology, virtue theory, and epistemic practice.
 - Frames a *theological grammar* - a set of categories and norms governing how intellectual desire is named, cultivated, and corrected.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among theologians interested in theological method, spiritual formation, and virtue epistemology; taken up in discussions about formation in seminaries and in interdisciplinary work with philosophy of religion.
 - Provokes renewed interest in Augustinian-Thomistic resources and critical engagement from analytic epistemologists and Protestant theologians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable corrective to fragmented accounts of belief by providing a vocabulary for the moral formation of thinkers.
 - Useful as a bridge between historical theology, method, and pastoral formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intellectual appetite (appetitus intelligibilis)** - desire oriented toward the intelligible; the central category tying love and cognition.
- **Theological grammar** - systematic account of categories and norms governing how appetites form theological knowing.
- **Formation (habituation)** - process by which intellectual desires are shaped through practices, virtues, and ecclesial life.
- **Affective cognition** - thesis that affectivity (love, desire) is constitutive for certain kinds of knowledge, especially of God.
- **Epistemic conversion** - transformation of the will and desires required for genuine assent and knowledge of divine truth.
- **Intellectual virtues** - habituated dispositions (e.g., humility, attentiveness) that orient the appetite toward truth.
- **Love-knowledge (amor et cognitio)** - Augustinian synthesis: knowing grounded in love; knowing as a function of right desire.
- **Revelation as formative** - revelation not merely propositional content but a formative reality that shapes appetites.
- **Assent vs. assent-formation** - distinction between isolated acts of belief and the lifelong formation enabling reliable assent.
- **Moral-epistemic unity** - doctrine that moral formation and epistemic competence are mutually constitutive.
- **Sacramental/communal formation** - emphasis on ecclesial practices as primary loci of shaping intellectual appetite.
- **Contra-evidentialism** - polemic against accounts that reduce belief to evidence-only justification.
- **Intellectual sin (mis-ordered loves)** - moral diagnosis when appetites are disordered, impairing knowledge.
- **Praxis of learning** - attention to pedagogical and spiritual practices that cultivate the appetite for truth.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological method debates to re-center desire in epistemology.
- As a **definition source** for courses on theological anthropology and spiritual formation, supplying technical vocabulary for intellectual formation.
- As a **polemic** against secular/evidentialist epistemologies and an **exegetical model** when interpreting texts that conjoin love and knowing (e.g., Augustine, Paul).
