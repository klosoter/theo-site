### TITLE
**Herman Bavinck - Reformed Dogmatics, Volume 2: God and Creation**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Dutch Reformed theology. Bavinck (1854-1921) writes as a leading representative of the Neo-Calvinist / confessional Reformed revival associated with the Free University (Amsterdam) and contemporaneous with Abraham Kuyper.
 - Reaction against liberal theology, pantheism, and reductionist naturalism; constructive appropriation of scholastic method and engagement with modern philosophy and science (Kant, Hegel, Darwin, Schleiermacher).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To present a biblically rooted, philosophically responsible doctrine of God and creation that secures the Creator-creature distinction, the sovereignty and providence of God, and the goodness and creaturely status of the world, while answering modern challenges to divine transcendence and revelation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with the possibility and limits of knowing God (natural theology and special revelation).
 - Systematic exposition of God's being: divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, eternity, omnipotence, omniscience, omnipresence, holiness, love, justice - and the method of speaking analogically.
 - Doctrine of the Trinity: immanent and economic relations, processions, and the unity of the divine essence in three persons.
 - Divine decree and providence: eternal counsel, creation ex nihilo, preservation, concurrence, governance, and secondary causation.
 - Doctrine of creation: creation of the world, its goodness, time and space, angels, humanity (imago Dei), and the created order's order and teleology.
 - Treatment of sin and the corruption of creation prepares for subsequent volumes on sin and redemption.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and medieval sources: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas; Reformation sources: Calvin and Reformed scholastics.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Schleiermacher and liberal Protestantism, Kantian criticisms of metaphysics, Hegelianism, Darwinian naturalism; dialogue with Kuyperian neo-Calvinism and Dutch Reformed thinkers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs special), theology proper (attributes, simplicity), Trinity, divine decree and providence, creation ex nihilo, angels, imago Dei, time/space, secondary causality, and preliminary treatment of sin as corruption of creation.
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers a covenantal, triune, sovereign God whose immanent and economic life grounds creation; theology of God and creation must hold divine transcendence and immanence in guarded balance while subordinating natural reason to Scripture as the decisive norm.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong synthesis of confessional Reformed orthodoxy with careful, philosophically literate engagement with modern thought - neither retreating into fideism nor capitulating to modernism.
 - Emphasis on the *analogy of being* and the communicability of certain divine attributes, preserving both God's incomprehensibility and meaningful theological speech.
 - Robust doctrine of divine providence that preserves genuine creaturely causality (secondary causation) without compromising divine sovereignty.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Polemical corrective to liberal subjectivism (Schleiermacher) and rationalist metaphysics: insists on objective revelation and the reliability of supernatural revelation.
 - More philosophical and systematic than some earlier Reformed scholastics, yet more dogmatic and scriptural than some modern apologetic approaches.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced treatment of attributes as expressions of the one divine being rather than separable faculties; careful semantic work on analogical predication to avoid equivocation or univocity.
 - Integration of covenantal thinking into doctrine of creation - creation is not an afterthought but ordered to covenantal ends.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major revival of interest following English translations (late 20th - early 21st century); widely used in Reformed seminaries and among conservative Protestants.
 - Influenced contemporary Reformed systematicians and apologetic models that balance confessional fidelity with engagement of modern science and philosophy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of how to do confessional, philosophically engaged systematic theology; rich resource for doctrine of God, providence, and creation that resists both capitulation to modernity and anti-intellectual pietism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creator-creature distinction**
 - Central presupposition; secures divine transcendence and creaturely contingency.
- **Creation ex nihilo**
 - Upholds God's absolute priority and non-material origin of the universe.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Attributes are identical to God's being; guards against composite or anthropomorphic conceptions of God.
- **Aseity, immutability, eternity**
 - Terms emphasizing God's self-existence, unchangeableness, and relation to time.
- **Analogy of being / analogical predication**
 - Method for speaking truthfully about God without univocity or equivocity.
- **Trinity (immanent vs economic)**
 - Distinguishes inner life of God from revelation in history; unity of essence with three persons.
- **Divine decree / eternal counsel**
 - God's sovereign ordinance governing creation and history.
- **Providence: preservation, concurrence, government**
 - How God sustains and governs creatures while allowing genuine secondary causality.
- **Secondary causation**
 - Upholds real creaturely agency; avoids fatalism while affirming divine concurrence.
- **General revelation vs special revelation**
 - Bavinck affirms the revelatory value of nature and conscience but insists Scripture's superiority for saving knowledge.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Human dignity and function; basis for moral responsibility and vocation in creation.
- **Angels / spiritual beings**
 - Treated as part of created order with distinct ontology and roles.
- **Sin as corruption**
 - Creation's order is wounded but not utterly destroyed - biblical realism about corruption and God's sustaining grace.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a *definition source*: authoritative articulations of classical Reformed doctrine (attributes, Trinity, creation).
 - As a *polemic resource*: engaged rebuttals to liberal theology, pantheism, and reductionist naturalism.
 - As an *exegetical-model/ conceptual pivot*: exemplary integration of scripture, historical theology, and philosophical analysis when teaching doctrine of God and creation.
