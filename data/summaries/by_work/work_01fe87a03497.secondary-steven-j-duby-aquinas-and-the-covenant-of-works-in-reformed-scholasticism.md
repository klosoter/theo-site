### TITLE
Steven J. Duby, "Aquinas and the Covenant of Works" (essay in collection on Reformed Scholasticism) - secondary study treating Thomas Aquinas's resources and resistances relative to the Reformed doctrine of the Covenant of Works.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Modern scholarly essay located in studies on Reformed scholasticism; situates medieval Thomistic theology as a background for early modern covenant debates.
 - Moves between primary Thomistic texts (Summa theologiae, Quaestiones, biblical commentaries) and Reformed scholastic reception (early modern Lutheran and Reformed authors).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Duby argues that Aquinas does not articulate a "covenant of works" in the later Reformed technical sense, but he supplies conceptual resources (law, reward, promise, merit) that made possible several proto-covenantal readings. Reformed scholastics selectively appropriated or rejected these Thomistic resources in forming the covenant doctrine.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Aquinas's account of prelapsarian human status: original justice, moral command(s) to Adam, promised reward (immortality/beatitude) and consequences for disobedience.
 - Analysis of Thomistic categories: natural law, divine command, merit and recompense, and the teleological framing of human finality.
 - Comparison with Reformed covenant of works: juridical/forensic framing, federal headship, conditional promise language.
 - Survey of Reformed scholastic engagement: where Thomistic language was adopted, adapted, or repudiated.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa & commentaries), with Augustine as background.
 - Secondary/reception: broad group of Reformed scholastic authors and covenant theologians who read or contested Thomistic motifs.
 - Scripture: Genesis 1-3 and Pauline typology (Adam/Christ).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant (functional analogue), law (natural/moral/divine), original justice, merit and recompense, anthropology (prelapsarian state), soteriology (Christ as second Adam), teleology (beatitude/ultimate end), and sacramental/mediatorial implications.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Aquinas furnishes a rich teleological and moral-lawminded framework that resembles but does not identically instantiate the Reformed Covenant of Works; his thought is thus both a source of conceptual tools and a foil for early modern covenantal formulations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Aquinas frames Adam's condition teleologically: obedience ordered to beatitude and participation in God's final end, rather than primarily as a juridical contract.
 - He emphasizes intrinsic moral order and natural law as the normative ground for obligations and rewards, not purely a bilateral legal pact.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against simplistic anachronistic readings, Duby stresses that Aquinas lacks explicit bilateral covenant vocabulary; his language centers on commands, promises, and gifts rather than Reformed federal legalism.
 - Contrasts Thomistic notion of merit and infused righteousness with Reformed forensic imputation and sola gratia.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Identification of "convenientia" and conditional promises in Thomistic texts as functional analogues to covenantal stipulations.
 - Parsing how teleology (final causes) in Thomism alters the shape of conditional divine-human relations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Reformed scholastics selectively borrowed Thomistic categories (natural law, reward/punishment schemes) while rejecting Aquinas on merit and sacramental mediation.
 - Duby shows the reception was complex: Aquinas served as both interlocutor and opponent in early modern covenant debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies medieval antecedents of covenantal thinking, aids accurate cross-traditional dialogue, and cautions against projecting later covenantal categories back onto medieval authors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Reformed technical doctrine: conditional, bilateral arrangement with Adam promising obedience in exchange for life; Duby: not explicitly present in Aquinas but paralleled functionally.

- **Prelapsarian state / original justice**
 - Thomistic account of Adam's initial disposition of gifts and order toward beatitude.

- **Natural law (lex naturae)**
 - For Aquinas the moral norm intrinsic to human nature that grounds obligation and makes commandments intelligible.

- **Divine command / promise**
 - Aquinas: God issues commands with concomitant promises/rewards, but embedded in teleology rather than contractual formality.

- **Merit (meritum)**
 - Thomistic category: human cooperation with grace can be meritorious in an ordered economy; a key point of divergence with Reformed forensic accounts.

- **Reward / beatitude**
 - End or recompense for obedience; Aquinas emphasizes final participation in goodness (beatific vision) over a merely legal reward.

- **Conventio / convenientia**
 - Medieval idioms for agreement or fittingness sometimes read by later interpreters as covenant-like; Duby highlights their role as analogues, not equivalences.

- **Forensic vs teleological framing**
 - Forensic: juridical, imputed righteousness and legal standing (Reformed).
 - Teleological: oriented to final end and perfection (Thomistic).

- **Federal headship**
 - Adam as representative; Aquinas has a notion of causal/representative ordering, but not fully juridical federal language used by Reformed theology.

- **Original righteousness / infused virtues**
 - Thomistic positive account of Adam's gifts, contrasted with Reformed emphasis on imputed righteousness.

- **Typology (Adam/Christ)**
 - Pauline typology accepted by Aquinas and central to later covenantal schema; interpretation differs in mechanics.

- **Sacramental economy**
 - Thomistic mediation and sacramental grace complicate a simple covenantal dichotomy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **historical-definition source** to trace antecedents of the covenant of works in medieval theology.
- As a **polemic/resource** in debates between Thomists and Reformed theologians over merit, law, and the nature of divine promises.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis/Adam in light of natural law and teleology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rapprochement or clarification between Thomistic and Reformed frameworks.
