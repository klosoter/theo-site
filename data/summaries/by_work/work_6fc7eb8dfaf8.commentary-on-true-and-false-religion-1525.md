### TITLE
Commentary on True and False Religion (1525) - Huldrych Zwingli

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in Zurich during the early Swiss Reformation (1525), a moment of iconoclasm, liturgical reform, and consolidation of magisterial Protestant practice.
 - Zwingli writes from a humanist-scholastic critique of medieval ceremony and sacramentalism, aiming to reorder worship around Scripture and preaching.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Distinguish authentic Christian religion (grounded in Word, faith, and Christ) from false religion (ceremonies, images, superstitions). Sacraments are *signs and pledges* of God's promise, not automatic instruments that confer grace independently of faith.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: medieval worship burdened by external rites, idolatry, and misplaced trust in sacramental efficacy.
 - Theological principle: the Word of God is norm and center; sacraments derive meaning and efficacy from the Word and from faith.
 - Sacramental thesis:
 - Sacraments are visible signs instituted by Christ to seal and confirm the promise of the Gospel (signum et pignus).
 - They must be administered according to the Word; without the Word and true faith they become empty or superstition.
 - They do not work ex opere operato; grace is not automatically transmitted by ritual alone.
 - Pastoral application: reform of worship, removal of images and useless ceremonies, catechesis to produce faith that receives the sacramental pledge.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture as primary source; appeals to Paul and Gospel narratives.
 - Critique of medieval scholastic sacramental theology and Roman practice (implicit polemic with Catholic sacramentalism).
 - Indirectly engages contemporary Reformers: anticipatory of debates with Luther (Lord's Supper controversy) and dialogical with Swiss colleagues (Oecolampadius, later Bucer).
 - Uses Augustine selectively (against scholastic excess) and humanist exegetical methods.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacraments (nature, purpose, efficacy), grace, justification by faith (implicit), Christology (presence of Christ in sacraments), ecclesiology (church as community of faith), worship and idolatry, Word and sacramental nexus.
- **Closing line**
 - True religion centers on the Word and trusting reception of Christ; sacraments are faithful signs and pledges that confirm and strengthen faith but do not, apart from the Word and faith, confer saving grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong formulation of sacraments as *pignus* (pledge/seal) rather than as operative causes of grace.
 - Emphasis on the primacy of preaching and Scripture for sacramental validity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects medieval notion of sacramental automaticity (ex opere operato) and Roman sacramental magic.
 - Moves beyond mere memorialism by insisting on real spiritual benefit tied to faith and the promise - thus distinct from extreme symbolic-only accounts.
 - Anticipates and sharpens the Zwinglian position later disputed with Luther over Christ's presence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reappropriation of classical/legal terms (pledge, witness) to describe sacramental function within covenantal promise.
 - Clear diagnostic vocabulary: "true" vs "false" religion as structural criteria tied to Word-centered worship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for the Zurich Reformed school; influenced Bullinger and the Swiss consensus.
 - Provoked and shaped early Eucharistic controversies (Marburg context) and contributed to continental Reformed sacramental theology that differentiates sign/seal from instrumental causation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Sharp model for assessing worship reforms, clarifies relationship between Word and sacrament, and offers a pastoral theology of sacraments as faith-strengthening pledges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **True religion / False religion**
 - Diagnostic pair: faith and Word-centered worship vs. superstitious rites and images.
- **Sacrament (sacramentum)**
 - Instituted sign by Christ; visible symbol tied to promise.
- **Sign and pledge (signum et pignus)**
 - Primary description: sacraments testify to and secure the promise of salvation for believers.
- **Means of grace**
 - Zwingli limits this: sacraments are means only insofar as they accompany the Word and elicit faith; not autonomous conveyors of grace.
- **Ex opere operato**
 - Rejected; ritual does not automatically effect grace apart from faith and the Word.
- **Memorialism / spiritual presence**
 - Rejects corporeal presence/transubstantiation; affirms a non-material, spiritual benefit to believers who receive in faith (distinguished from pure memorialism).
- **Word and sacrament nexus**
 - The Word authorizes, interprets, and effects the sacrament's significance; sacraments without Word become empty.
- **Idolatry (images, ceremonies)**
 - Uses term to critique medieval liturgical accretions that divert worship from God.
- **Covenant language**
 - Sacraments function within the covenant as seals of promise.
- **Faith (fiducia)**
 - The necessary receptacle for sacramental benefit; faith does not spring from ritual but from hearing the Word.
- **Church discipline / worship reform**
 - Practical outworking: reform of rites, catechesis, removal of superstitions.
- **Presence (Christ's presence)**
 - Real but spiritual and promise-based, not bodily transformation.

How this work is used across loci:
- Definition source: poster-child for a Reformed definition of sacrament as sign/pledge rather than automatic instrument.
- Polemic tool: often cited against Roman sacramentalism and against Lutheran claims of corporeal presence.
- Exegetical model: shows a Word-first hermeneutic for sacramental interpretation and liturgical reform.
