### TITLE
Defending Constantine - Peter J. Leithart

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid renewed debate over the "Constantinian" turn in Christian history.
 - Written from Leithart's patristically-informed, Reformed vantage; engages contemporary political-theological critics of Constantine (esp. pacifist/Anabaptist critiques).
 - Part of a broader movement reappraising the relationship between church and empire, liturgy and politics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Constantine's conversion and policies should not be summarily condemned as a corrupting "Constantinian shift." Rather, Constantine sought to reorder public life in ways that cohered with a Christian vision of peace, worship and moral law; his acts must be judged both historically and theologically with nuance.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical re-evaluation: close reading of late-antique sources (Eusebius, imperial legislation, council records) to correct caricatures of Constantine as cynical opportunist.
 - Theological claim: Constantine attempted to instantiate a Christian polis - a sacramental and juridical reshaping of public order - that was continuous with (not antithetical to) certain biblical and patristic convictions.
 - Polemic against critics: argues that some modern condemnations rest on ahistorical abstractions about church/politics or anachronistic ideals of separation.
 - Practical-theological implications: calls for a renewed minority report on how Christians should view political power and the magistrate's role.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary patristic sources: Eusebius, Lactantius, Athanasius, council acts (Nicaea) and imperial legislation.
 - Modern interlocutors: Stanley Hauerwas, John Howard Yoder, and other critics who use Constantine as a symbol of church compromise.
 - Broader conversations: historians of late antiquity, ecclesiologists, political theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (church/state relations, councils, public worship)
 - Sacraments (baptism, liturgy as public formation)
 - Christology and Trinitarian contours as shaping public religion
 - Political theology (magistrate, law, peace/war ethics)
 - Eschatological imagination as it shapes public order

- **Closing line**
 - Leithart's center of gravity: Constantine represents an ambiguous but theologically intelligible effort to make public order conform to a Christian imagination - a contested experiment that deserves historically-informed, theologically subtle defense rather than simple denunciation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Constantine as a sacramentalizing political actor: politics as formative of worship and vice versa, not merely corrupting.
 - Prioritizes primary patristic sources and legislative texts to overturn modern caricatures.
 - Emphasizes continuity between certain patristic political imaginaries and Constantine's reforms.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the standard "Constantinian turn = corruption" thesis popular in pacifist and postliberal critiques.
 - Challenges the modern assumption that separation of church and state is the only faithful response to Constantine.
 - Argues that some criticisms mistake political instrumentalization for principled Christian governance.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "Christendom" and "Constantinian" as historically complex categories, usable for analysis rather than mere reproach.
 - Introduces rhetoric treating imperial acts as forms of liturgical and disciplinary ordering (politics as public catechesis).

- **Reception & influence**
 - Provoked debate: welcomed by some conservative and confessional theologians; resisted by Anabaptist-influenced and pacifist scholars.
 - Has become a common touchstone in recent church-state discussions and in Reformed assessments of political engagement.
 - Stimulated renewed patristic and legal-historical study among evangelicals and traditionalists.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful historical-theological method: primary-source driven, wary of modern projection.
 - Useful corrective to simplified narratives; pushes students to weigh complexities when assessing Christian politics.
 - Provokes necessary rethinking of how ecclesiology and political theology interact in concrete contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Constantinian shift**
 - Leithart: a contested heuristic, not a unitary moral failure; must be historically specified.
- **Christendom**
 - Not simply tyranny or triumphalism but a socio-political ordering shaped by Christian institutions and rhetoric.
- **Sacramentalization of power**
 - The idea that political acts can function as formative, quasi-liturgical actions in public life.
- **Edicts and laws (Constantine's legislation)**
 - Treated as theological texts shaping moral and ecclesial life, not mere secular policy.
- **Council of Nicaea / ecclesial adjudication**
 - Example of imperial facilitation of doctrinal resolution; used to show cooperation, not total co-optation.
- **Baptism of Constantine**
 - Interpreted within the patristic practice and symbolic politics of late antiquity; not reducible to opportunism.
- **The Christian polis**
 - A conceptual term for the civic ordering Leithart defends as an historical possibility.
- **Magistrate / vocation of rulers**
 - Reclaimed as a theologically significant office with duties to order society toward peace and justice.
- **Peace (pax) as theological aim**
 - Constantine's policies read as aiming at a Christian peace, not purely imperial consolidation.
- **Anti-Constantinian polemic**
 - The modern theological posture Leithart critiques; he calls for nuance rather than blanket rejection.
- **Patristic retrieval**
 - Methodological posture: privileging Fathers and late-antique sources for theological-political questions.
- **Public worship / liturgy**
 - Understood as formative for civic identity; a bridge between ecclesial and public life.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for rethinking the "Constantinian" narrative in political theology and ecclesiology.
 - As a polemic against pacifist/Anabaptist critiques of historical church-state entanglement.
 - As a model for patristic-exegetical method in assessing historical theological actors.
