### TITLE
Evil and the God of Love (1966) - John Hick

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century engagement with the problem of evil in analytic and systematic theology. Post-Holocaust theological urgency; rising attention to natural as well as moral evil. Reaction to traditional Augustinian formulations and to the existential challenge represented by Hume and later analytic objections.
- **Central thesis**
 - The classical Augustinian theodicy is inadequate; a more plausible Christian response is an **Irenaean "soul-making" theodicy**: God allows suffering and evil as necessary conditions for the moral and spiritual development of finite persons destined for eventual eschatological completion.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Distinguishes **moral evil** (resulting from free agents) and **natural evil** (suffering not directly caused by moral agents). Argues that Augustine's privation theory and original guilt do not adequately explain natural evil or innocent suffering.
 - Alternative proposal: Adopts and reinterprets **Irenaeus** - humans created initially immature (in the "image" of God) and must be formed into God's likeness through a world that permits challenge, struggle, and growth ("vale of soul-making").
 - Key moves:
 - Many virtues (compassion, courage, unselfish love) **require** situations involving suffering and risk; such goods are not producible by a world of mere delight.
 - **Epistemic distance**: God must remain, in some sense, not overwhelmingly evident, so creatures can freely respond; that distance contributes to the presence of evil as a world-condition.
 - Eschatological conclusion: The development begun in this life is completed by God - Hick entertains a form of **universal eschatological completion** (universal salvation understood as eventual moral transformation).
 - The work is sustained by philosophical clarifications, theological reflection, and pastoral concern rather than purely deductive logical argument.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary retrieval of **Irenaeus** (image/likeness framework). Direct critique of **Augustine** (privation-of-good, original sin explanations). Engages modern critics (Humean problem of evil), and anticipates analytic debates (free-will defenses).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theodicy and divine justice (central), anthropology (image/likeness, maturity), providence, eschatology (completion / universal destiny), divine attributes (omnipotence reinterpreted functionally), and pastoral soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - A move from punishment/explanation to **formation and eschatological transformation**: God permits evil not as good but as the constituent context in which genuine moral persons are made.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rehabilitation of the **Irenaean paradigm** as theologically and morally plausible; concentration on **soul-making** rather than juridical explanations.
 - Emphasis on **existential and pastoral adequacy**: addresses why suffering can be meaningful for moral formation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects Augustinian answer that links most evil to metaphysical privation or to an inherited guilt requiring penal retribution.
 - Contrasts with simple free-will defenses by giving a role to natural evil and to divine epistemic strategy, not just voluntary moral choice.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear articulation of **epistemic distance** as a theological-theodical category.
 - Integration of moral-developmental psychology with classical theism to explain the presence of unavoidable suffering.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in late 20th-century theodicy; widely taught across seminaries. Sparked sustained debate: praised for pastoral sensitivity and intelligibility; criticized by analytic philosophers and conservative theologians for underplaying sin, penal aspects of salvation, and for empirical adequacy (why excessive/animal suffering?).
 - Impacted subsequent work on natural evil, soul-making models, and theological anthropology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust alternative framework to Augustinian juridical accounts; valuable for pastoral theology, interdisciplinary dialogue (psychology, ethics), and courses on theodicy and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Soul-making theodicy**
 - Central label for Hick's account: suffering as instrument for moral and spiritual formation.
- **Irenaean theodicy**
 - Source tradition: two-stage creation (image then likeness) reframed for modern concerns.
- **Augustinian theodicy**
 - Contrasted position: privation of good, original sin, often seen as inadequate for natural evil.
- **Privation theory of evil**
 - Augustine-rooted concept that Hick critiques as explanatorily thin.
- **Epistemic distance**
 - God intentionally preserves a degree of hiddenness so creatures can freely develop morally.
- **Natural evil vs moral evil**
 - Distinction emphasized; both explained via soul-making and world-conditions rather than solely free will.
- **Vale of soul-making**
 - Metaphorical descriptor (Keats-referenced); the world as environment for maturation.
- **Eschatological completion / universal destiny**
 - Hick leans toward universalist implications: ultimate transformation of all persons.
- **Divine omnipotence (reinterpreted)**
 - Power conceived in relational/teleological terms rather than coercive fiat that would eliminate genuine freedom or soul-development.
- **Moral virtues as developmental goods**
 - Courage, compassion, faith, etc., require contexts that may include suffering.
- **Pastoral adequacy**
 - Emphasis on addressing existential questions of sufferers, not merely philosophical refutations.
- **Theodicy vs defense**
 - Hick offers a full theodicy (explanatory scheme) rather than the narrower analytic "defense" strategy.
- **Skeptical theism (precursor themes)**
 - Anticipates later moves that emphasize human epistemic limitations regarding God's reasons.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "soul-making" and Irenaean theodicies in systematic and historical theology.
 - As a **polemic** against Augustinian/penal-centric theodicies and as a conceptual pivot toward eschatological universalism and pastoral responses to suffering.
 - As a **model** for interdisciplinary theodicy bridging ethics, psychology, and eschatology in teaching and case studies.
