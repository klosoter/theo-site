### TITLE
**Calvin, Participation, and the Gift: The Activity of Believers in Union with Christ** - J. Todd Billings

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary Reformed scholarship concerned to recover the breadth of Calvin's soteriology in the wake of two dominant readings: the strictly forensic/imputational model and pietistic/subjective appropriations. Billings writes as a Reformed systematician and historian engaging Calvin's Institutes and commentaries against modern debates about union with Christ, sacraments, and believer activity.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Calvin understands believers to *participate* in Christ in a way that makes their activity genuinely present but thoroughly dependent on the Spirit-given gift of union. Billings argues this "participation as gift" recovers Calvin's balanced account of justification, sanctification, and sacramental life against reductionist interpretations.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Historical-theological groundwork: locates Calvin in patristic, medieval, and Reformation debates on union and participation. 
 - Exegetical center: reads Pauline texts (esp. Romans, 1 Corinthians) as Calvin's scriptural matrix for participation. 
 - Doctrinal analysis: traces how Calvin integrates **imputation** and **real participation** without collapsing one into the other. 
 - Sacramental and pastoral implications: shows the Spirit as the mediator of participation, and the sacraments as tangible means of the gift. 
 - Theological synthesis: offers a model where believer activity is responsive and real but contingent upon Christ's gratuitous gift.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries). 
 - Historical interlocutors: patristic authors, medieval participation language, Reformation figures (contrast with Lutheran emphases; Osiander debated). 
 - Contemporary scholars in Reformation studies and systematic theology (engagement with modern Reformed readings that over-emphasize forensic imputation).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Union with Christ, participation, justification, sanctification, sacraments (esp. Eucharist), Holy Spirit, grace/gift, faith (active/passive dynamics), covenantal life, Christology.

- **Closing line:** 
 Billings recovers a Calvin in which believers truly share in Christ-an active, spiritual participation that remains decisively grounded in the Spirit-bestowed gift of Christ's life and righteousness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Frames Calvin's account of believer activity under the rubric **"participation as gift,"** stressing the priority of divine initiative while preserving human responsiveness. 
 - Highlights Calvin's consistent use of participatory and sacramental language rather than reducing his soteriology to legal imputation alone.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects readings that present Calvin as purely forensic or as a proto-Thomist causalist; resists both a reductive imputation-only model and any view that makes believer works contributive to justification. 
 - Distinguishes Calvin from Osiandrian and some Lutheran emphases by showing Calvin's mediated (Spirit-sustained) real presence rather than a simple ontologizing of righteousness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Consolidates disparate Calvinic motifs under a single conceptual pivot-**participation as gift**-useful for bridging historical exegesis and contemporary systematic concerns.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential among students of Calvin, Reformed systematicians, and sacramental theologians seeking a middle path between forensic and mystical extremes. 
 - Widely used in seminary courses on Calvin, union with Christ, and Reformation theology as a corrective and clarifying resource.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a concise, well-documented corrective to caricatures of Calvin; provides an integrated model for teaching justification, sanctification, and sacrament rooted in union with Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** central relational category; real, Spirit-mediated sharing in Christ's life that grounds both justification and sanctification. 
- **Participation (koinonia):** core term-Billings emphasizes Calvin's use to denote sharing in Christ as a gracious gift, not mere forensic reckoning. 
- **Gift:** theological pivot word; underlines divine initiative and gratuitousness of union and all believer activity. 
- **Imputation:** Calvinic legal forensic element retained; Billings stresses it as complementary to, not exclusive of, participation. 
- **Justification:** forensic declaration rooted in Christ's righteousness, received in union; linked to but distinguished from sanctification. 
- **Sanctification:** real outcome of participation; believer transformation occurs in and through union with Christ, by the Spirit. 
- **Holy Spirit:** the mediator and agent of participation; makes Christ present and effects believer activity as enabled gift. 
- **Sacraments (esp. Eucharist):** tangible means by which the Spirit communicates the gift of participation; signs that enact and confirm union. 
- **Faith (active/passive):** treated as gifted response-active believer appropriation enabled by passive reception of divine grace. 
- **Forensic vs. Ontological language:** Billings shows Calvin navigates both-legal language for standing, ontological/participatory language for life. 
- **Causality and mediation:** rejects simplistic causal accounts that make human activity instrumental to justification; emphasizes Spiritly mediation. 
- **Covenant:** relational framework for how gift and faith operate across the community and sacraments.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for Calvinic "participation" in union with Christ. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about the relation of imputation and sanctification. 
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Calvin's Institutes and commentaries on Pauline texts. 
 - As a **polemic resource** against overly forensic or overly mystical accounts of Reformed soteriology.
