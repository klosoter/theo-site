### TITLE
**The Crucified God** (1972) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar German theology; after Theology of Hope (1964). Written amid political theology, liberation movements, and debates on divine impassibility, death-of-God theologies, and the memory of Auschwitz.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The cross of Jesus is the critical center of Christian theology and the doctrine of God. God truly suffers in the crucifixion; this trinitarian event reveals divine love, addresses theodicy through divine solidarity with victims, and grounds Christian hope.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Confronts atheism of protest and the problem of evil; cross as the scandal that answers not by explanation but by God's participation in suffering.
 - Exegesis of Jesus's cry of dereliction (Ps 22/Mark 15:34) as the decisive revelation of God in abandonment.
 - Reconfigures the doctrine of God: against impassibility; for divine pathos and trinitarian differentiation in the event of the cross.
 - Soteriology as liberative solidarity: justification of the ungodly and freedom for oppressed communities.
 - Ecclesial and political consequences: the church as the fellowship of the crucified, committed to suffering love and public hope.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Luther's theologia crucis; Barth (actualism, revelation); Bonhoeffer (religionless Christianity); Hegel (negativity; critically used); Jewish voices on divine pathos and suffering (Heschel; post-Auschwitz witness); Metz's political theology; as well as conversation with death-of-God and liberation currents.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Bibliology**: cross-centered hermeneutic of Scripture.
 - **Theology proper/Trinity**: divine passibility; trinitarian event of the cross; Spirit as bond of love in separation and reconciliation.
 - **Christology**: the person and forsakenness of the Son; vicarious suffering.
 - **Soteriology**: justification, reconciliation, liberation, solidarity.
 - **Doctrine of sin**: godlessness, enmity, abandonment as experienced in the cross.
 - **Eschatology**: resurrection as vindication of the crucified and the horizon of protest-hope.
 - **Ecclesiology/Mission**: church as community shaped by the cross for public praxis.
- **Closing line**
 - The crucified and risen Jesus is the center by which God, the world, and the church are known; theology must be a theology of the cross for the life of the world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Divine passibility**: God suffers; the cross is internal to God's life.
 - **Trinitarian interpretation of the cry of dereliction**: differentiated suffering of Father and Son in the Spirit.
 - **Solidarity with victims**: God is identified with the godless and the suffering.
 - **Hope as protest**: resurrection grounds critique of injustice and endurance in lament.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against classical **impassibility/immutability** when abstracted from the gospel; rejects a metaphysical deity incapable of compassion.
 - Qualifies charges of **patripassianism**: the Father does not die on the cross, but suffers the loss of the Son.
 - Pushes beyond purely forensic atonement accounts detached from historical suffering; critiques harmonizing theodicies.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **History of God**: God's triune life disclosed in historical event, especially the cross.
 - **Perichoresis of pain**: communion amid separation; the Spirit as the bond of love in the rift.
 - **Hermeneutics of the cross**: Scripture and doctrine normed by the crucified.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalytic for political, liberation, feminist, Black, and disability theologies; significant stimulus for social-trinitarian trajectories.
 - Criticized by classical theists and some Reformed voices for re-defining impassibility and risking tritheism; yet widely mined for cross-centered theism and pastoral theodicy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Keeps the church at the foot of the cross; legitimates lament; ties doctrine of God to Jesus's history; integrates soteriology with public ethics and hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theologia crucis**: Luther's theology of the cross as methodological key; God known in suffering, not glory.
- **Divine passibility**: God's capacity to suffer; not weakness, but the power of cruciform love.
- **Crucified God**: the scandalous identification of God with the crucified Jesus.
- **Godforsakenness**: the Son's dereliction; revelation of sin's depth and God's nearness to the abandoned.
- **Trinitarian event of the cross**: differentiated suffering of Father and Son; the Spirit maintains communion-in-separation.
- **History of God**: God's self-involving history with the world; doctrine shaped by events of Jesus.
- **Perichoresis of pain**: mutual indwelling that bears and transforms suffering within God's triune love.
- **Patripassianism (qualified)**: rejection of naive form; affirmation of the Father's suffering of love.
- **Kenosis**: self-emptying of the Son into solidarity with sinners and victims.
- **Solidarity/liberation**: soteriology as identification with the oppressed, issuing in concrete freedom.
- **Protest atheism**: modern protest against a silent God; answered by God's own protest in the cross.
- **Hermeneutics of the cross**: Scripture and doctrine read from the vantage of Calvary and resurrection.
- **Eschatological hope**: resurrection as the future of the crucified; energizes critique and praxis.
- **Fellowship of the crucified**: the church's identity and mission formed by participation in Christ's suffering.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **doctrinal pivot** in theology proper and Trinity to articulate divine suffering and love.
 - As a **Christological center** for reading forsakenness and vicarious suffering.
 - As a **soteriological and ethical frame** for solidarity, liberation, and justification.
 - As a **hermeneutical guide** in bibliology and an **eschatological model** for hope as public protest.
