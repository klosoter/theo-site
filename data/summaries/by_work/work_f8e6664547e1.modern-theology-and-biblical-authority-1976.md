### TITLE
**Modern Theology and Biblical Authority** (Vern Poythress, 1976)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-1970s theological milieu: reaction to 20th-century liberalism and neo-orthodoxy; rising evangelical concern for inerrancy and scriptural authority; engagement with Barthian and existential hermeneutics.
 - Poythress writes from a conservative Reformed, presuppositionalist horizon, aiming to retrieve classical doctrines of revelation against modern revisions.

- **Central thesis**
 - Modern theological trends that relativize Scripture undermine Christian theology; robust doctrines of biblical authority must be grounded in the Bible's own self-witness and a consistent theological method that preserves both propositional content and the Trinitarian framework of revelation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic move: traces how modernism and neo-orthodoxy construe revelation (subjective encounter, historical-critical skepticism), producing diminished normative force of Scripture.
 - Methodological defense: argues for a disciplined hermeneutic that preserves grammatical-historical exegesis together with canonical and doctrinal coherence.
 - Theological prolegomena: insists revelation is propositional and authoritative because it issues from the triune God; thus Scripture's authority is not merely functional or pragmatic but grounded in God's communicative act.
 - Trinitarian safeguard: emphasizes the interplay of economic and ontological aspects of the Trinity so that doctrinal formulations about authority and submission respect incommunicable attributes and personal relations.
 - Polemical application: applies these principles to contemporary controversies (including later debates about eternal functional subordination), arguing that exegetical care prevents conflation of role-subordination with ontological inferiority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit and explicit dialogue with liberal theologians, Bultmannian existentialism, Karl Barth (on authority tensions), and emergent evangelical inerrancy movements.
 - Deploys Scripture as primary source, supplemented by classical creedal formulations and Reformed dogmatic touchstones.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and biblical authority (central)
 - Trinity (economic vs. ontological relations)
 - Christology (incarnation as locus of revelation)
 - Hermeneutics and theological method
 - Ecclesiology and pastoral consequences of authority claims

- **Closing line**
 - Scripture's normative claim must be defended by a Trinitarian, propositional, and canonically sensitive theology of revelation that resists modern reductions and prevents doctrinal distortions such as conflating role distinction with ontological inequality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that biblical authority is grounded in the communicative act of the triune God, not merely in historical reliability or existential encounter.
 - Careful distinction between *what Scripture asserts* (propositional content) and the *experiential appropriation* of that content in faith.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects neo-orthodox tendencies that prioritize encounter over propositional truth, and liberal tendencies that demythologize and relativize revelation.
 - Contrasts with both reductionist modernism (which reduces authority to utility) and with any account that makes ontological claims about the Trinity dependent on extra-biblical philosophical categories.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the methodological boundary between economic subordination (role) and ontological equality (being) to protect classical Trinitarianism.
 - Emphasizes a hermeneutic that is both confessional and exegetical-canonical reading that is not merely dogmatic assertion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a careful defense of biblical authority; used as a resource for responding to modernist critiques.
 - Indirectly influential in later Trinitarian debates by providing methodological guardrails that shaped how conservative theologians assess claims about eternal functional subordination.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact framework for integrating hermeneutics, revelation, and doctrine; valuable for teaching prolegomena and for safeguarding Trinitarian orthodoxy in contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical authority** - Scripture's binding normative status grounded in divine communication.
- **Propositional revelation** - Revelation as content-bearing statements (not merely existential experience).
- **Grammatical-historical method** - Exegetical approach Poythress defends for responsible textual interpretation.
- **Canonical reading** - Interpreting texts within the whole canon to preserve doctrinal coherence.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (roles/functions of Father, Son, Spirit).
- **Ontological Trinity** - Intra-Trinitarian being and equality of persons (essence/being).
- **Role-subordination (economic)** - Functional submission in the economy of salvation; permitted and biblical.
- **Ontological subordination (eternal)** - Claim of permanent inferiority in being-Poythress implicitly rejects or cautions against conflating this with biblical role language.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling and relational unity within the Trinity; used to support equality of being amid functional distinction.
- **Hermeneutical presuppositions** - Prior commitments that shape reading; Poythress argues for biblical presuppositions.
- **Modern theology** - Broad label for liberal and neo-orthodox trends under critique.
- **Inerrancy (implicit)** - Underlying conviction that Scripture is reliable in its claims; Poythress ties authority to divine origin.
- **Doctrinal coherence** - Theological method privileged: consistency across loci to prevent misreading of texts.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, Trinitarian grounding of biblical authority in prolegomena courses.
- As a **polemic** against modernist and neo-orthodox reductions of Scripture's normative status.
- As an **exegetical-method model** for treating Trinitarian passages responsibly-useful in debates over eternal functional subordination to distinguish role from being.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology to keep revelation, hermeneutics, and doctrine integrated.
