### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Atonement (various lectures and articles) - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th century North American Protestant context; Machen as conservative Princeton/Westminster-influenced Presbyterian responding to rising theological liberalism, Ritschlian and modernist currents, and the cultural shifts of modernity.
 - Delivered in lecture and essay form for seminary audiences and public apologetics; aimed at both academic and ecclesial correction.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The atonement is an objective, historically efficacious act of Christ in which the incarnate Son bears the penalty due sinners - i.e., **penal substitution** is the biblical and Reformed center of the doctrine. Modern interpretations that reduce the atonement to moral influence, myth, or mere example are inadequate and theologically ruinous.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: read the New Testament (especially Pauline soteriology) as affirming substitution, propitiation, and imputation.
 - Theological necessity: sin incurs divine wrath and requires real satisfaction; God's holiness and justice make a penal transaction necessary for reconciliation.
 - Christological focus: the person and work of the incarnate Son provide the only fitting and efficacious ground for atonement.
 - Polemic component: critique of rival theories (moral influence, governmental theory, mythic accounts) that depersonalize or spiritualize the cross.
 - Practical and pastoral implications: the atonement grounds assurance, justification by faith, and ecclesial preaching.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed and patristic witnesses (Augustine, Calvin) and scholastic categories (satisfaction, imputation).
 - Contemporary opponents: liberal theologians (Ritschl and successors), moral-influence proponents (e.g., Abelard's legacy), and governmental-theory advocates.
 - Scripture (Pauline corpus, Johannine texts, sacrificial imagery) as primary evidence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, substitution), soteriology (atonement, justification, imputation), divine attributes (justice, holiness, mercy), covenantal dimensions implicitly affirmed.

- **Closing line**
 - Machen's atonement theology insists that the cross is the decisive, objective act by which God satisfies his own righteousness and redeems his people - a theological anchor against modernizing drift.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Unflinching defense of **objective penal substitution** as both biblical and necessary for coherent doctrine of justification and assurance.
 - Strong linkage between divine justice and mercy: the atonement reconciles without compromising God's holiness.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct critique of the **moral influence** model for making Christ's death merely exemplary.
 - Rejection of attenuated governmental theories that make the cross symbolic punishment to uphold moral order rather than a real penalty borne by Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much neologisms as forceful reapplication: Machen reasserts classical Reformed vocabulary (satisfaction, imputation, propitiation) against modern euphemisms and abstractions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles; formative for American evangelical defenses of penal substitution.
 - Used as a touchstone in debates over modernism vs. orthodoxy; continues to be cited in apologetics and seminary instruction.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous exegetical-theological engagement and clear polemical strategy; useful for defending classical soteriology and for teaching the doctrinal coherence of penal substitution within systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution** - Christ bears the penalty of sin in the sinner's stead; central Machen claim.
- **Substitution** - The legal and relational exchange: Christ for sinners.
- **Imputation** - Righteousness and guilt legally accounted to Christ and believers respectively.
- **Satisfaction** - The idea that divine justice is satisfied by Christ's bearing of penalty.
- **Propitiation** - The removal of divine wrath through Christ's sacrifice (used to maintain objective reconciliation).
- **Expiation** - Removal of guilt; often paired with propitiation in Machen's analysis.
- **Limited/definite atonement** - Tendency in Machen's posture to favor particular redemption consistent with Reformed confessions (contrast with universal general atonement).
- **Moral influence theory** - Treated as inadequate: atonement reduced to example or moral effect on humans.
- **Governmental theory** - Treated critically: sees atonement as demonstration of divine displeasure rather than Christ's penalty-bearing.
- **Objective vs. subjective atonement** - Machen insists on objectivity (historical, judicial fact) over subjective, experiential-only accounts.
- **Necessity of the atonement** - Theological claim that divine justice required a real expiation for sin.
- **Efficacy/appropriation** - Distinction between what Christ accomplished (objective) and how benefits are received (faith, union with Christ).
- **Reconciliation & justification** - Consequences of the atonement: restored relationship and declared righteousness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for penal substitution within Reformed systematic theology.
 - As **polemic** against liberal/moral-influence readings in historical theology and apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline readings of justification, imputation, and sacrifice.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the coherence between Christology and soteriology.
