### TITLE
Leo the Great: Selected Letters (trans. and ed. Carolinne White) - concentrated papal correspondence shaping late antique Christology, especially the articulation of the **Hypostatic Union** (notably the Tome to Flavian and related letters).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-5th century Rome (pontificate 440-461). Intense Christological controversies after Nestorius and Eutyches, culminating in Council of Chalcedon (451).
 - Letters assembled and translated by Carolinne White present representative papal interventions addressed to bishops, emperors, and councils; they function as both pastoral rulings and doctrinal briefs.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the one Person of Christ: the eternal Word (Logos) truly assumed full human nature without division or confusion-opposing both Nestorian separation of persons and Eutychian/Monophysite absorption of the human into the divine.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural and patristic exegesis to show the Word becomes flesh (incarnatio) and acts in history.
 - Logical/ontological move: distinction of two natures (physis) united in one hypostasis/person (hypostasis/persona), preserving properties of each while denying dual subjects of the one Christ.
 - Pastoral-legal tone: letters function as authoritative determinations, calling for correction, deposition, or conciliation of erring bishops.
 - Repeated sub-moves:
 - Affirm full divinity (unaltered) and full humanity (complete including soul and will).
 - Deny mixture/ alteration (no confusion) and deny separation (no division into two persons).
 - Use analogies, syllogistic logic, and appeals to tradition (Cyril, Scripture, apostolic faith).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opponents: Nestorius (and Nestorian tendencies), Eutyches and later Monophysite proponents, Dioscorus.
 - Allies and sources: Cyril of Alexandria, Augustine (implicitly via Latin tradition), Chalcedonian delegates, imperial court.
 - Institutional interlocutors: Flavian of Constantinople, Eastern bishops, and the emperor; the letters were read/applied at Chalcedon.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum, incarnation, humanity of Christ (soul, will).
 - **Trinity** (secondary): implicit in affirming the Word's divinity; careful language to avoid subordination.
 - **Ecclesiology / authority**: papal role in defining and certifying orthodoxy.
 - **Soteriology**: implications of real humanity + divinity for redemption.
- **Closing line**
 - Leo's letters centrally aim to hold together Christ's full divinity and full humanity in one undivided hypostasis so that salvation is both real and attributable to the one incarnate Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong juridical/papal voice: doctrinal formulations are issued as authoritative corrections, not merely speculative theology.
 - Concrete insistence that the Word assumed a real human nature including a rational soul and human will-explicit rejection of Apollinarian and Eutychian diminutions of true humanity.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Nestorian tendency to separate the person of Christ into two subjects by insisting on one hypostasis/person of the Word.
 - Counters Eutychian/Monophysite tendency to fuse or absorb the human into the divine by insisting on two natures preserved without confusion.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Latin refinement of Greek categories: careful deployment of hypostasis, natura (physis), persona, and communicatio idiomatum in ways that feed directly into Chalcedon's formula.
 - Practical theological style: letters as doctrinal instruments for councils rather than purely theological treatises.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Primary source for Chalcedonian definitions; widely appealed to in both Eastern and Western traditions as authoritative Christological witness.
 - Contested in the East by Miaphysite traditions; later Western (Augustinian-Reformed) theologians cite Leo in Christological formulations.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of balancing ontological precision and pastoral authority; indispensable for teaching the hypostatic union and the pastoral implications of orthodox Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - union of two complete natures (divine and human) in one hypostasis/person (central Leo claim).
- **Hypostasis / Persona** - Leo uses these terms to assert one personal subject: the Word as subject of incarnate acts.
- **Physis / Natura (nature)** - two distinct natures preserved (divine and human) without confusion or change.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - the mutual attribution of properties: what can be said of the person (e.g., "God suffered" inasmuch as the person who is God suffered in the flesh).
- **Incarnatio (the Word becoming flesh)** - real assumption of full humanity, including rational soul and will.
- **Unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably** - operational adjectives (Chalcedonian language influenced by Leo) describing how natures coexist.
- **Nestorianism (opposed)** - separated persons or subjects in Christ; Leo rejects this as dividing the one person.
- **Monophysitism / Eutychianism (opposed)** - fusion or absorption of human nature into divine; Leo rejects this as destroying true humanity.
- **Tome of Leo (Letter 28)** - key letter to Flavian articulating the one person / two natures formula; foundational text for Chalcedon.
- **Papal juridical authority** - Leo's letters illustrate the exercise of Roman see's doctrinal authority in late antiquity.
- **Assumption of a human will & soul** - explicit against Apollinarian diminishment; central to Leo's soteriology.
- **Chalcedonian formulation (influence)** - Leo's language and distinctions provide the conceptual pivot for the council's creed.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Christology (teaching the hypostatic union and communicatio idiomatum).
 - As a **polemic resource** against Nestorian and Monophysite readings-model for theological refutation.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model**: using Scripture, pastoral rulings, and conciliar procedure to settle doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for ecclesiology (papal role) and for later Reformed and orthodox traditions when grounding the person-nature distinction.
