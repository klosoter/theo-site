### TITLE
God Without Being - Jean-Luc Marion

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century French phenomenology intersecting Catholic theology; a post‑Heideggerian, phenomenological critique of classical metaphysics and traditional onto-theology. Responds to the problem of how theology can speak of God after the collapse of metaphysical grounding.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Classical metaphysics reduces God to a highest being (the ontological category of "being") and thereby domesticates revelation. Marion argues for a theology that thinks God *without being* - i.e., refuses to subsume God under the category of Being - by reorienting thought to the phenomenology of **givenness** and the experience of revelation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnoses the tradition of **onto-theology**: God treated as a supreme object within the order of beings; metaphysics conflates Being and God.
 - Applies phenomenological method (reduction to givenness) to theological questions: prioritizes how the phenomenon of God shows itself over ontological predicates.
 - Introduces the notion of the **saturated phenomenon** (developed more fully elsewhere) to account for experiences that exceed conceptual determination - revelation as an excess that overwhelms the subject and the object-categories.
 - Reclaims apophatic concerns: God is more properly spoken of in terms of giftedness, call, and manifestation than as an entity with ontological properties.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heidegger (critique/appropriation of his critique of metaphysics), Husserlian phenomenology, Augustine and negative theology resources, Aquinas and scholastic ontotheology (as target), Kierkegaard and modern theological existential concerns; later dialogues with contemporary philosophical theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, divine transcendence, negative theology (apophaticism), scant but crucial implications for Trinity and Christology insofar as persons and eventhood must be rethought in terms of givenness rather than ontic status.
- **Closing line:** Theology must stop thinking God as the highest being and instead attend to God as an overwhelming gift - a phenomenon of excess that discloses God without reducing God to Being.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Moves from ontology to **phenomenology of donation**: God is primarily the One who gives, not an item within the inventory of being.
 - Emphasis on **excess**: revelation saturates and exceeds human categories, creating an epistemic asymmetry between giver and receiver.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Unlike classical metaphysics (Aquinas, ontotheology), Marion refuses the identification of God with ipsum esse subsistens; unlike a simple Heideggerian recovery of Being, he refuses to reify a new metaphysics of Being as solution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized and concretized the claim "God without being" and related it to the method of givenness; anticipates and links with the concept of the **saturated phenomenon**.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in continental theological and philosophical theology circles; catalyzed renewed interest in phenomenological approaches to revelation and in critiques of onto-theology.
 - Received with caution in analytic and more classical systematic circles but employed as a corrective in contemporary constructive theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a rigorous methodological alternative to ontotheology, useful for courses on negative theology, phenomenology of religion, and modern systematic theology.
 - Provokes productive rethinking of how doctrines (revelation, Trinity, personhood) are formulated when God is no longer treated as a supreme ontic instance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Onto-theology:** The philosophical-theological habit of thinking God as the highest being; Marion locates this as the problem to be overcome.
- **Givenness (donation):** Phenomenological priority of what is given; Marion makes this the starting point for theology rather than metaphysical categories.
- **Saturated phenomenon:** A phenomenon that overwhelms conceptual and sensory capacity; revelation is paradigmatic.
- **Excess:** The surplus by which divine manifestation exceeds all concepts and conditions of possibility.
- **Apophaticism (negative theology):** Emphasized as consonant with Marion's method - God is primarily what cannot be captured by being-concepts.
- **Phenomenological reduction (to givenness):** Reorients philosophical attention from objects to the manner in which they are disclosed; Marion adapts this for theological ends.
- **Event (theophany):** God appears as an event that gives itself; eventality displaces ontic predicates.
- **Idolatry/Representation critique:** The critique of treating God as objectified, a warning against representational theology.
- **Transcendence as relation:** Transcendence reframed as asymmetric gifting rather than ontological distance measured by rank among beings.
- **Donation vs. Constitution:** Contrasts a model of divine giving with constitutive subject-object models of cognition.
- **Phenomenal priority of Revelation:** Revelation is not reducible to theological propositions but is the saturating datum for theology.
- **Applies to Trinity/Christology:** Suggests reformulating persons and incarnation in terms of saturated givenness rather than ontic taxonomy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for contemporary critiques of ontotheology and for phenomenological theology.
- As a **polemic** in systematic theology against classical metaphysical formulations of divine being.
- As an **exegetical model** for thinking revelation and theophany in biblical and liturgical theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in constructive theology to reconceive divine transcendence, personhood, and revelation.
