### TITLE
The Bible and the Trinity: Believing Scripture and the Doctrine of the Trinity (co-edited with Michael Allen, 2018) - contribution by Scott Swain; Reformed-evangelical, confessional engagement with contemporary Trinitarian controversies (notably Eternal Functional Subordination debates).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2018 amid renewed evangelical debate over the Trinity sparked by proponents of Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) in the 2000s-2010s; situated within Reformed, confessional, academic evangelicalism seeking to recover creedal Trinitarianism anchored in Scripture and classical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture must govern doctrine of the Trinity; contemporary proposals that posit **eternal role-based subordination** (EFS) threaten classical Nicene affirmations of the equality and unity of essence among Father, Son, and Spirit by collapsing ontological distinctions into economic roles.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Affirm the primacy of exegesis and confessional theology in formulating Trinitarian doctrine.
 - Distinguish carefully between **economic** (works of God in history) and **immanent** (God's eternal life) Trinity to prevent illicit transfer of temporal role language into eternal ontology.
 - Recover creedal motifs (homoousios, monarchy of the Father, relations of origin) to resist using functional subordination as a foundation for social or ecclesial hierarchies.
 - Deploy classical theological resources (Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine, Reformed confessions) to show how Scripture coheres with orthodox formulations against EFS.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of EFS (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware) and critics (e.g., Kevin Giles, Michael Bird).
 - Historical sources: Nicene and post-Nicene Fathers, medieval and Reformed theologians, and key biblical passages (John, Pauline epistles, Philippians 2).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and biblical authority, Trinity (economic vs. immanent), Christology (relation of Son to Father), divine attributes (simplicity, immutability), relations of origin (begetting/spirating), and implications for ecclesiology/authority.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Scripture-rooted, creedal Trinitarianism insists on ontological equality of the divine persons while preserving ordered relations of origin - thereby rejecting EFS insofar as it makes eternal role-differentiation imply ontological subordination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stress on **Scripture plus classical theology** as corrective to modern role-based innovations; theological method integrates exegesis with doctrinal retrieval.
 - Precision in using immanent/economic distinction to guard against category errors that make temporal roles determine eternal being.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against evangelical EFS proposals that read functional authority into the immanent Trinity and, by implication, justify static ontological inequality.
 - Corrections to readings that prioritize contemporary social-ethical concerns (e.g., gender roles) over sober doctrinal parsing of biblical language about relations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful appropriation and clarification of classical terms (relations of origin, monarchy of the Father) to speak against modern "functional hierarchy" models without abandoning relational ordering language.
 - Re-articulation of divine simplicity and relationality to show compatibility with personal distinctions yet single divine essence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited within conservative Reformed circles as an articulate resource opposing EFS; used in seminary courses, confessional journals, and denominational debates.
 - Served as a rallying text for those seeking to defend Nicene orthodoxy in evangelical debates about authority and gender.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models disciplined exegetical-theological method; valuable for teaching the immanent/economic distinction and for rebutting conflations that produce theological and practical errors.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS):** Claim that the Son is eternally subordinate in role/authority to the Father; Swain treats this as a problematic conflation of economy and ontology.
- **Economic Trinity:** The persons of the Trinity as they relate and act in history; proper locus for language of role and order.
- **Immanent Trinity:** The eternal, intra-divine life; proper locus for speaking of relations of origin and ontological equality.
- **Ontological Equality:** Equality of being/essence among Father, Son, Spirit; a non-negotiable Nicene commitment.
- **Relations of Origin (begetting/spirating):** Classical categories used to distinguish persons without implying inequality; emphasized as explanatorily primary for the immanent life.
- **Monarchy of the Father:** The constitutional role of the Father as the source within Trinity; used to preserve order without subordination of essence.
- **Divine Simplicity:** Doctrine appealed to in order to argue against dividing divine essence into sub-personal principles or making relations imply differential being.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling):** Used to articulate interpersonal interpenetration that secures unity and equality even amid ordered relations.
- **Homoousios:** Nicene term affirming same essence; invoked to repudiate any doctrine implying ontological subordination.
- **Economic/Immanent distinction (method):** Central hermeneutical tool to prevent transfer of temporal-functional language to eternal ontology.
- **Scriptural exegesis (model):** Close reading of New Testament witness (e.g., Johannine, Pauline texts) combined with creedal interpretation.
- **Role vs. Being distinction:** Critical analytic distinction emphasized to counter role-based ontological claims.
- **Authority language in Scripture:** Treated as primarily economic until justified for immanent application.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classical, confessional opposition to EFS.
- As a **polemic** resource in ecclesial debates where Trinitarian claims are enlisted for gender/authority arguments.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** for integrating Scripture and creedal theology in Trinitarian studies.
