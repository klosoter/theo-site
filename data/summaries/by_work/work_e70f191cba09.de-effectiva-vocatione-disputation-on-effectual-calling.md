### TITLE
**De Effectiva Vocatione** (Disputation on Effectual Calling) - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Late 17th-century Reformed orthodoxy; Geneva; post-Reformation scholastic method.
 - Anti-Remonstrant consolidation after Dort; engages Jesuit/Molinist, Roman Catholic, Lutheran synergist, and Socinian positions.
 - Within Turretin's Institutes; situated in the ordo salutis and covenant of grace.

- **Central thesis / problem**
 - God's saving call is **efficacious, particular, and monergistic**, infallibly producing conversion without violating human freedom, ordinarily through the Word and Spirit.
 - Distinguishes **external/general call** from **internal/special call**; denies that grace is a mere moral suasion or a resistible aid.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture establishes an ordo: predestination-calling-justification-glorification (Rom 8:30); the called according to purpose are certainly saved.
 - Causality analysis:
 - **Principal efficient cause**: Holy Spirit.
 - **Instrumental cause**: the preached Word and sacraments (ordinarily).
 - **Formal effect**: infusion of a new habitus (new heart) with illumination and renovation, yielding faith and repentance.
 - **Final cause**: union with Christ unto holiness and glory.
 - Freedom and efficacy:
 - Grace acts **suaviter et fortiter**: sweetly yet powerfully; no coaction, no suspension on autonomous will.
 - Compatibilist account: will remains free as to natural liberty while its moral impotence is healed.
 - Universality and particularity:
 - External call is **serious and well-meant** to many; internal call is **particular** to the elect.
 - Rejects universal sufficient saving grace and hypothetical universalism.
 - Means and scope:
 - Ordinarily by the Word; extraordinarily possible (e.g., infants of believers), yet never by the Word apart from the Spirit.
 - Church's ministry is the arena of the call; mission mandated.
 - Polemical clarifications:
 - Rejects synergism, Pelagian and semi-Pelagian preparatory merit, and bare moral influence.
 - Distinguishes sufficient vs efficient grace; affirms irresistibility as invincibility, not compulsion.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Positively: Scripture (John 6; Acts 16:14; 1 Cor 1:24; 2 Thess 2:14), Augustine, Calvin, Dort.
 - Against: Remonstrants (Arminius, Episcopius), Jesuits (Molina, Suarez) on scientia media and sufficient grace, Socinians, some Lutheran synergists, and Amyraldian hypothetical universalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and means (Bibliology); covenant of grace; Trinity and missions ad extra; Christology and union; pneumatology; soteriology (regeneration, faith, repentance, perseverance); ecclesiology and sacraments; eschatological calling and glorification.

- **Center of gravity**
 - God effectually and sweetly conquers the sinner's resistance by the Spirit through the Word, uniting to Christ according to the eternal purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Fine-grained causal analysis of calling with principal/instrumental distinction.
 - Strong account of **moral inability** paired with maintained natural liberty.
 - Ordinary use of the Word; allowance for extraordinary cases without making them normative.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Remonstrants: denies a resistible prevenient grace universally given; affirms infallible efficacy for the elect.
 - Against Roman Catholic/Molinist views: rejects scientia media and the sufficient/efficacious grace split that makes efficacy depend on human consent.
 - Against Socinians: calling is not mere moral persuasion.
 - Against rigid immediatism: regeneration is ordinarily **mediate** by the Word and Spirit; denies ex opere operation of sacraments.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Distinguishes **external vs internal call**, **sufficient vs efficient grace**, **moral suasion vs physical/coercive causation**; asserts **invincible** not **compulsive** grace.
 - Employs **habitus** language for infused new disposition; faith as God's gift produced by the call.
 - Uses the four causes to map calling; integrates with **ordo salutis** and **union with Christ**.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard Reformed account alongside Westminster Standards; informs Hodge, Bavinck, Berkhof.
 - Cited in debates on free offer, mission, infant salvation, and means of grace.
 - Resource for contemporary compatibilist freedom and donum fidei discussions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Doctrinal clarity across loci; exegetical anchors; polemical precision; pastoral utility for preaching, catechesis, and assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Effectual calling**: God's efficacious summons that infallibly brings the elect to faith in Christ.
- **External/general call**: Universal proclamation of the gospel; serious and well-meant; resistible in itself.
- **Internal/special call**: Inward operation of the Spirit uniting with the Word to produce consent and conversion.
- **Monergism**: God alone is the decisive efficient cause of conversion; excludes synergistic cooperation as the ground of efficacy.
- **Irresistible/invincible grace**: Not coercive; cannot finally be thwarted by the elect; produces willing assent.
- **Sufficient vs efficient grace**:
 - Sufficient: grants objective warrant and obligation; not saving in itself.
 - Efficient: actually effects conversion; peculiar to the elect.
- **Moral suasion vs physical force**:
 - Moral suasion alone (Socinian/Remonstrant) is denied.
 - Physical compulsion is denied; grace works sweetly and powerfully.
- **Habitus (new heart)**: A Spirit-wrought disposition enabling acts of faith and love.
- **Regeneration**: The new birth coincident with effectual calling; ordinarily by the Word and Spirit.
- **Illumination**: Cognitive aspect of calling; removal of ignorance and blindness.
- **Renovation**: Volitional and affective transformation; inclination to the good.
- **Union with Christ**: Teleological and instrumental nexus of benefits; calling as the doorway.
- **Means of grace**: Word and sacraments as instruments; Spirit as principal efficient cause.
- **Ordo salutis / golden chain**: Calling linked to justification and glorification; ensures perseverance.
- **Free offer**: Sincere, indiscriminate proclamation grounded in God's revealed will, harmonized with particular efficacy.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for effectual calling in soteriology and the ordo salutis.
 - As a polemical template against synergism, Molinism, and Amyraldianism.
 - As an exegetical model for key calling texts (John 6; Rom 8; Acts 16).
 - As a conceptual pivot connecting Bibliology (means), Ecclesiology (ministry), and Christology (union).
