### TITLE
**Christ on Parnassus (1911) - P. T. Forsyth**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1911 by P. T. Forsyth, a late-Victorian/Edwardian Scottish Presbyterian theologian reacting to liberal theology, Ritschlian reductionism, and rising speculative/critical trends.
 - Work sits in a pastoral-theological milieu that prizes both doctrinal seriousness and cultural engagement; addresses modern aesthetic and intellectual appropriations of Christ (hence the Parnassus literary allusion).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend the classical, paradoxical Christian doctrine of the Incarnation and Atonement against kenotic theories and liberal reductions that would divest the Son of divine attributes.
 - To show that Christ's self-emptying (kenosis) must be understood as volitional, relational, and vicarious, not as ontological loss.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opens by diagnosing modern tendencies to aestheticize or moralize Christ (placing Christ on "Parnassus" as a cultural idol) rather than confessing him as the paradoxical, saving Word.
 - Moves to exegetical insistence on texts like Philippians 2:5-11: kenosis as self-humbling and mission, not abandonment of deity.
 - Systematically critiques forms of kenotic theory that posit relinquishment of divine attributes (intellect, omniscience, omnipotence) and contrasts these with a robust doctrine of personhood and vicarious action.
 - Re-articulates divine impassibility in dynamic, personal terms: God suffers and acts in the cross without forfeiting divine identity.
 - Concludes by reaffirming substitutionary, objective atonement as the theological center and primary corrective to both liberal and speculative distortions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit critique of Ritschlian and liberal theologians who domesticate Christ; engagement with contemporary kenotic theorists (late-19th century German debates).
 - Draws on Pauline exegesis, patristic motifs of self-emptying, and Reformed priorities (personhood, substitution).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, kenosis, person and natures)
 - Atonement (substitution, vicarious suffering)
 - Divine attributes (impassibility/passibility, omniscience, omnipotence)
 - Revelation (Christ as decisive, historical event rather than merely ethical exemplar)
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Forsyth insists that Christ's kenosis must be read theologically as a voluntary, vicarious self-limitation in mission - preserving the Son's divine personhood and the objective, salvific reality of the cross.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Emphasizes **personhood**: God acts and suffers personally; divine impassibility is re-read to allow authentic suffering without ontological loss.
 - Insists on the **objectivity** of atonement: salvation is accomplished in a real, vicarious transaction, not merely modeled or inspired ethically.
 - Frames kenosis as **relational and volitional** rather than as a metaphysical subtraction of attributes.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects theological liberalism and Ritschlian reductions that turn Christ into moral exemplar or cultural genius.
 - Opposes radical kenoticism (e.g., theories implying Christ ceased to be omniscient or omnipotent) as incoherent with historic Christian confession.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasts traditional categories (impassibility, omniscience) into a dialectical framework that preserves divine continuity while accounting for genuine human limitation in the Incarnation.
 - Uses aesthetic-cultural imagery (Parnassus) to critique secular appropriation-bridges literary critique and dogmatic defense.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative and Reformed circles as a robust critique of early 20th-century kenotic and liberal trends.
 - Valued by those seeking to preserve classical Christology while engaging modern thought; less influential among theological liberals who continued to explore kenotic models.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, rhetorically strong corrective to any thesis that sacrifices divine personhood for anthropological intelligibility.
 - Useful for pastors and teachers addressing modern misreadings of Philippians 2 and contemporary kenosis debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis / kenoticism**
 - Forsyth: self-emptying as volitional humility and mission; rejects kenoticism that posits ontological loss of divine attributes.
- **Self-emptying**
 - Ethical/relational surrender of status, not metaphysical diminution.
- **Incarnation**
 - The Son assumes genuine human life and limitation while remaining the divine person; radical union without conflation.
- **Personhood (divine/personal)**
 - Central category: God's actions and sufferings are personal and relational, not impersonal processes.
- **Impassibility / passibility**
 - Reinterpreted: God can suffer in a personal, redemptive way without forfeiting divinity.
- **Omniscience / omnipotence**
 - Treated as attributes held within the divine person; human ignorance or limitation in Christ is real but compatible with divine knowledge in the person.
- **Vicarious atonement / substitution**
 - The decisive, objective accomplishment of salvation; the cross is the locus of divine action, not merely moral example.
- **Philippians 2:5-11**
 - Key exegetical hinge: read as theological confession of kenosis that affirms, not diminishes, Christ's deity.
- **Objective reality of salvation**
 - Salvation as an event accomplished by God's action, resisting subjective or purely moral accounts.
- **Cultural critique (Parnassus motif)**
 - Warns against aestheticizing Christ and reducing him to cultural genius or ethical archetype.
- **Relational theology**
 - Emphasizes interpersonal dynamics within God's action in history rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Theological imagination**
 - Forsyth's appeal to a robust theological creativity that holds paradox and mystery without capitulation to modern reductionism.

How this work is used:
- As a **polemic** against kenotic theories that imply ontological loss of deity.
- As a **resource** for conservative/reformed Christology defending substitution and the continuity of divine attributes in the Incarnation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 theologically rather than merely morally or culturally.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rethinking impassibility in ways that allow genuine divine suffering without dissolving classical theism.
