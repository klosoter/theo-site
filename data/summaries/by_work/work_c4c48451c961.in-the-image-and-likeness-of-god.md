### TITLE
In the Image and Likeness of God - Vladimir Lossky

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th‑century Orthodox theological renaissance among Russian émigré scholars in Paris; part of a broader neo‑patristic recovery reacting against Western scholasticism and modern rationalism.
 - Written within the climate of ecumenical dialogue (Creeds, Filioque controversies) and renewed attention to Patristic theology (especially Cappadocians and Palamas).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical formula "image and likeness" must be read in patristic and apophatic key: **image** names the created orientation and capacity of the human person; **likeness** denotes the divinizing destiny (theosis) achieved by participation in God's life. Anthropology is therefore inseparable from Trinitarian and soteriological doctrine.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of how the Fathers distinguish image and likeness and how that distinction shapes a personalist, relational anthropology.
 - Theological defense of theosis: human transformation occurs by participation in the divine **energies**, not by assimilation to divine **essence**.
 - Integration of Christology and sacramental life: Incarnation and Eucharist are the means by which the likeness is restored.
 - Polemic against reductive Western readings that treat the image as mere rationality or moral capacity and that reconfigure Trinitarian relations (e.g., Filioque).
 - Practical implication: human destiny is communal, liturgical, and ascetical - realized in the Church through synergy of grace and effort.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Cappadocians (Gregory of Nyssa, Basil), Maximus the Confessor, Gregory Palamas, later Byzantine ascetics.
 - Contrasts with Augustine and Latin scholastic tendencies; interlocution with modern Western theologians in ecumenical settings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (processions, monarchy of the Father), Pneumatology (Spirit's role in theosis), Christology (Incarnation as deifying event), Anthropology (image/likeness), Soteriology (theosis), Ecclesiology and Sacramentality (Eucharist as participation), Apophatic theology, Ethics (transformation of the person).

- **Closing line**
 - Lossky situates human identity as created for participation in the divine life: the true meaning of being "in the image" is actualized as likeness through Trinitarian communion and sacramental theosis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong commitment to the **essence‑energies** distinction: salvation is real participation in God's uncreated energies, preserving divine transcendence while enabling union.
 - Anthropology is fundamentally **personalist and relational**, not primarily intellectualist or biological.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Western reductions that equate the image with rationality, legal status, or imago Dei as property; opposes tendencies that collapse personhood into substantialism.
 - Critiques Filioque formulations for disturbing Trinitarian order and thereby affecting anthropology and pneumatology.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Rearticulation of ancient patristic categories (image/likeness, nous, kenosis) for modern theological discourse, making them serviceable in ecumenical debate.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within contemporary Orthodox theology and ecumenical studies; widely used as a primary presentation of patristic anthropology.
 - Received with interest in Reformed and Western circles mainly as corrective and stimulus for recovering deification themes; some resistances remain over metaphysical idioms (essence/energies).

- **Enduring value**
 - Restores a sacramental, Trinitarian anthropology that informs ethics, liturgy, and pastoral theology; remains a key resource for teaching theosis and for ecumenical debates about the Creeds and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Image (imago Dei)** - the created capacities and orientation toward God; ontological starting point of human personhood.
- **Likeness (similitudo / theosis)** - the goal: participation in divine life; moral‑spiritual transformation effected by grace.
- **Theosis / Deification** - central soteriological concept: being made partakers of the divine energies.
- **Essence‑Energies distinction** - theological device preserving divine transcendence (essence) while allowing real communion (energies).
- **Apophatic theology** - emphasis on negative theology and the unknowability of divine essence; shapes Lossky's method.
- **Nous / Heart** - the spiritual center of the person; faculty for communion with God (contrasted with mere intellect).
- **Monarchy of the Father** - Trinitarian ordering that grounds Lossky's critique of the Filioque.
- **Filioque** - contested clause ("and the Son") in the Western Creed; Lossky treats it as altering Trinitarian relations and thus anthropological implications.
- **Nicene‑Constantinopolitan Creed** - authoritative ecumenical formulation Lossky defends as preserving correct Trinitarian and anthropological doctrine.
- **Hypostasis / Person** - patristic category for the personal reality of Father, Son, Spirit; used to articulate relational ontology.
- **Kenosis / Incarnation** - Christ's self‑emptying as the vehicle of human deification.
- **Eucharistic communion** - principal sacramental means of participation in divine life.
- **Synergy** - cooperative activity of grace and human response in the process of likeness.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source**: authoritative statement of image/likeness distinction for Orthodox anthropology courses.
 - **Polemic**: resource in ecumenical and doctrinal critiques of Filioque and scholastic reductions of imago Dei.
 - **Exegetical/model**: model for reading Fathers on anthropology, pneumatology, and the Creeds; pivot for integrating sacramental practice with theological anthropology.
