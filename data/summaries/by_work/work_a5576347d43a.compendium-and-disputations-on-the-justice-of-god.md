### TITLE
Compendium and Disputations on the Justice of God - Francis Turretin (Reformed scholastic, 17th c.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑17th century Reformed scholasticism centered in Geneva; Turretin (1623-1687) wrote within the post‑Calvinist academic milieu reacting to Arminianism, Socinianism, and various internal Calvinist controversies (e.g., Amyraldian tendencies). The material appears as part of his systematic compendium and disputation style expositions used in the Academy of Geneva.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the absolute righteousness of God in creation, providence, sin, election/reprobation, and redemption - showing that divine justice is both essential and communicable, and that mercy and pardon are compatible with justice through Christ's penal satisfaction and forensic imputation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and species of divine justice (essential, distributive, commutative, retributive/penal).
 - The origin and moral status of human sin: guilt (pes culpae) and corruption (vis peccati) transmitted from Adam; accountability and inability without especial grace.
 - Law, obligation, and divine sanction: God as sovereign legislator with rightful penalties; the legitimacy of punitive suffering.
 - Atonement and satisfaction: Christ's obedience and suffering as efficient satisfaction for sin; distinction between congruent and satisfying merit.
 - Imputation and justification: forensic transfer of guilt/ righteousness; justification by imputative righteousness, not infused merit.
 - Providence, election, and reprobation: justice in the ordering of salvation and condemnation; defenses of God's right to elect and pass by.
 - Application to theodicy: why God permits evil, the role of divine ends, and how God's righteousness remains unblemished.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary scriptural exegesis (Pauline and prophetic texts), Calvin and later Reformed teachers, Aristotelian and scholastic categories (causality, merit), direct polemic against Arminians, Socinians, and some Roman Catholic formulations of merit and satisfaction.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as standard for justice), covenant theology (works/grace), original sin, depravity, freedom and responsibility (compatibilist), providence, Christology (mediation and satisfaction), justification (forensic), and final retribution.
- **Closing line**
 - A rigorous scholastic defense that frames divine justice as the necessary ground for both condemnation and gracious pardon, satisfied in Christ and consistent with God's absolute sovereignty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise scholastic distinctions: essential vs. legal notions of justice; exact delineation of congruent (proportionate) vs. satisfying (expiatory) merit.
 - Firm forensic/legal language: justice explicated primarily in juridical terms (court, imputation, satisfaction).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Socinian denial of penal satisfaction and Arminian attempts to relativize divine sovereignty; refutes Roman Catholic accounts that mix infused merit and condign merit with a different account of satisfaction.
 - Rejects moralistic or sentimental theodicies that portray God's permission of evil as a failure of justice rather than a sovereign ordering for greater ends.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic application of Reformed covenant categories to the doctrine of justice; tighter integration of imputation theory with both original sin and Christ's work.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard reference in Reformed seminaries (Geneva, later Princeton and conservative Reformed schools); influential in shaping orthodox Calvinist responses to modern critiques of God's justice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, disciplined model for combining biblical exegesis, scholastic precision, and pastoral implications - indispensable for teaching forensic soteriology and classical theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine justice (iustitia divina)** - God's rectitude in essence and right-ordering of moral relations; the overarching category.
- **Essential justice vs. legal/forensic justice** - Distinguishes God's intrinsic righteousness from his role as covenant‑maker and lawgiver.
- **Retributive/penal justice** - God's administration of deserved punishment; central to understanding sin and atonement.
- **Imputation (adscriptio)** - Forensic transfer: Adam's guilt to descendants; Christ's righteousness to believers.
 - Contrast: imputation vs. infusion (Turretin rejects infusional models).
- **Original sin: guilt and corruption** - Transmission of both juridical guilt and corrupt nature; grounds for condemnation absent grace.
- **Satisfaction/penal substitution** - Christ's vicarious sufferings satisfy divine justice; distinguishes satisfying merit from congruent merit.
- **Forensic justification** - Declared righteous by imputation, not by inherent merit.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace** - Framework for understanding God's rights and mercy as covenantal relations.
- **Predestination / reprobation** - Treated as compatible with divine justice; God's permissive and decretive will explained within providential ends.
- **Providence and permissive will** - God's governance includes permission of evil for higher purposes without impugning justice.
- **Congruent vs. condign merit** - Turretin clarifies merit language to oppose Roman scholastic conflation.
- **Efficiency and sufficiency in atonement** - Christ's work both sufficient (for all in value) and efficient (applied to the elect).
- **Moral responsibility and compatibilist liberty** - Maintains human culpability under divine determinative counsel.
- **Law and sanction (lex and poena)** - Law defines obligation; sanctions reveal divine justice.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a foundational **definition source** for classical Reformed understandings of justice and imputation.
- As a **polemic manual** against Arminian, Socinian, and Roman Catholic alternatives on satisfaction, merit, and predestination.
- As an **exegetical‑theological model** for integrating Pauline soteriology, covenantal categories, and theodicy in seminaries.
