### TITLE
The Cambridge Companion to Reformed Theology - sections on Sacraments (Paul T. Nimmo; David S. Fergusson)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary scholarly volume (Cambridge Companion series) situating Reformed doctrine within historical and systematic perspectives.
 - Essays respond to renewed interest in sacramental theology among Protestant scholars and to ecumenical conversations with Roman Catholic and Orthodox sacramental thinking.
 - Authors write from post-Reformation, broadly Calvinian/Reformed vantage with attention to historical development and constructive retrieval.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed sacramental theology centers on the sacraments as **covenantal signs and seals** that mediate Christ and his benefits by means of the Word and the Spirit, without collapsing sacramental efficacy into either mere symbol or physical transformation.
 - Problem addressed: how to account for Christ's real presence and sacramental efficacy while rejecting Roman transubstantiation and purely memorialist accounts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical tracing: distinctions among Zwingli (memorialist), Calvin (spiritual real presence), and other Reformed figures; liturgical and pastoral implications mapped.
 - Theological analysis:
 - Emphasis on **Word-Sacrament unity**: sacraments operate as ordained means because they are joined to God's Word.
 - Role of the **Holy Spirit**: Spirit effects reception and appropriation of Christ in sacraments; efficacy is not in material elements but in Spirit-mediated promise-fulfilment.
 - Covenant framework: sacraments function within covenantal signs (baptism as entrance into covenant people; eucharist as covenant renewal and feeding on Christ).
 - Pastoral and ecclesial consequences: infant baptism, admission to covenant community, assurance, worship practice, frequency and form of Lord's Supper.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary Reformed voices: Calvin, Bucer, Zwingli, Knox, later Reformed confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg).
 - Roman Catholic and Lutheran positions are engaged as contrasting loci (transubstantiation, sacramental ontology; Lutheran ubiquity/real presence debates).
 - Contemporary theological interlocutors on pneumatology and ecclesiology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology proper (baptism; Lord's Supper), covenant theology, ecclesiology (visible/invisible church), Christology (presence of Christ in sacraments), pneumatology (Spirit's role in appropriation), Word and Scripture as norm.

- **Closing line**
 - The essays locate Reformed sacramental theology at the intersection of **covenantal sign-seal logic, Word-sacrament unity, and pneumatological appropriation of Christ**, offering a middle path between mere symbolism and material transformation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong articulation of **Word-Sacrament unity**: sacraments do not stand alone but function only as the Word's visible continuation.
 - Emphasis on **covenantal incorporation**: sacraments mark corporate membership and promise-infused identity (not private, magical transactions).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushback against:
 - Roman Catholic emphasis on ontological change in elements (transubstantiation).
 - Radical memorialism that reduces the supper to mere remembrance and undermines assurance and ecclesial communion.
 - Reinterprets Calvin as offering a robust "real presence" that is spiritual and mediated, not physical or localistic.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refocus on **instrumental causality** (sacraments as instruments of grace because joined to Christ's promise and Spirit) rather than metaphysical change in elements.
 - Renewed articulation of sacramental **ecclesiality** - sacraments as constitutive of the church's life and identity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable for ecumenical dialogue: offers a coherent Reformed account intelligible to Roman and Orthodox interlocutors while defending Protestant distinctives.
 - Influential in contemporary Reformed liturgical renewal and in pastoral resources on baptismal catechesis and eucharistic life.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise synthesis of Reformed sacramental commitments suitable for teaching, debate, and pastoral formation; durable for constructive retrieval in contemporary theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign and seal** - sacraments as visible signs (significant actions) and seals (assurance of God's promise).
- **Word-Sacrament unity** - doctrine that sacraments serve the Word and receive their efficacy by being attached to it.
- **Instrumental causality** - sacraments as instruments by which God effects grace through promise and Spirit, not through intrinsic physical change.
- **Real presence (spiritual)** - Calvinian account: Christ is truly present and received by faith through the Spirit, without bodily ubiquity in elements.
- **Memorialism** - Zwinglian emphasis that the Lord's Supper is primarily symbolic remembrance; used in discussions as the foil to Reformed views.
- **Transubstantiation / consubstantiation** - Roman and some Lutheran terms contrasted and rejected by Reformed essays to clarify distinctives.
- **Covenant theology** - sacramental function embedded in covenant signs (baptism as entrance; Eucharist as covenant renewal).
- **Pneumatology (sacramental)** - role of the Holy Spirit in applying Christ's benefits in sacraments.
- **Visible / invisible church** - baptism's role in marking visible membership; tension with assurance and election.
- **Paedobaptism** - infant baptism defended as covenantal inclusion; pastoral implications are emphasized.
- **Eucharistic frequency & form** - liturgical practice debated in light of ecclesial identity and formation.
- **Assurance** - sacraments as means to nurture and confirm faith; not automatic guarantors of salvation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed sacramental theology (concise statements of sign/seal and Word-sacrament unity).
 - As a **polemic/contrast** in debates with Roman Catholic and memorialist positions.
 - As an **exegetical and ecclesiological model** for liturgical practice, baptismal catechesis, and Eucharistic theology in churches seeking Reformed retrieval.
