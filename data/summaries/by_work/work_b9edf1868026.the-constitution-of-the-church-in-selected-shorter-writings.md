### TITLE
The Constitution of the Church (in Selected Shorter Writings) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton Reformed context; Warfield (1851-1921) as leading conservative theologian defending confessional Presbyterianism against theological liberalism and ecclesiastical accommodation.
 - Essay collected in Selected Shorter Writings; addresses acute denominational disputes over polity, authority, and discipline in American Presbyterianism and wider Protestant churches.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church is a divinely instituted society whose constitution (offices, sacraments, government, discipline) rests upon Christ's appointment and Scripture, not upon civil authority or congregational voluntarism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Starts from the biblical claim that Christ is the sole Head and Founder of the church; therefore its essential constitution must be sought in Scripture.
 - Argues for the divine institution of church offices (elders/pastors) and the propriety of a representative, corporate government (Presbyterian model).
 - Defends the church's right and duty to exercise discipline and govern its own affairs independently of the civil magistrate.
 - Rejects Erastianism (state supremacy over church) and voluntarism (church as mere voluntary association), positioning a confessional, covenantal polity as theologically mandated.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary appeal to Scripture; secondary appeal to Reformation and Reformed standards (implicitly Westminster Confession and catechisms), Calvinian and Scottish Presbyterian practice.
 - Polemical posture toward Erastian tendencies, modernist ecclesiology, and lax denominationalism that compromises confessional authority.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (nature, marks, constitution of the church)
 - Ministry and ordination (office, eldership, pastoral function)
 - Discipline and authority (ecclesiastical jurisdiction, courts)
 - Church-state relations (distinct spheres; non-subordination of church)
 - Sacramental and covenantal aspects undergirding corporate identity

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The true constitution of the church is rooted in Christ's divine institution and Scripture, enacted in a confessional, ordered polity that preserves the church's spiritual independence, authoritative ministry, and duty of discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A rigorous insistence that the church's constitution is primarily a theological (Scriptural and covenantal) question, not merely an institutional or sociological one.
 - Sharp defense of the office of elder as a divinely sanctioned, corporate governing reality rather than a mere functional role.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Erastian and voluntarist models by insisting on the church's spiritual autonomy and divine warrant for its government.
 - Opposes liberal ecclesiologies that reduce church identity to ethical fellowship or voluntary association.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear delimitation of "constitution" as a theological category: the form and rule of the church as ordered by divine ordinance rather than civil constitution or human contract.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles; used as a succinct theological defense for confessional polity and discipline in 20th-century denominational controversies.
 - Read as a classic Princeton articulation of ecclesiology - often cited by those resisting theological modernism and denominational dilution of office and discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to argue polity from Scripture and confessional theology; valuable for seminarians and church leaders in debates over ordination, courts, and ecclesiastical autonomy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Constitution of the Church** - Theologically grounded ordering of the church (offices, sacraments, government, discipline) by divine ordinance.
- **Divine institution** - The principle that key elements of church life (offices, sacraments) are instituted by Christ and Scripture, not by human preference.
- **Office / Eldership (Presbyters)** - Office-bearers instituted by Christ to govern, teach, and shepherd; corporate and representative in character.
 - Relation to ministry: ordination confers office by the church according to divine law.
- **Ordained ministry** - Ministry authorized by the church through ordination; not identical with mere service or charisma.
- **Discipline** - The church's God-given responsibility to maintain purity, correct sin, and adjudicate membership; essential to its constitution.
- **Ecclesiastical courts** - Ordered, representative judicatory bodies (session, presbytery, synod) that exercise governance and discipline.
- **Erastianism** - The subordination of church to state; explicitly rejected by Warfield as theologically illegitimate.
- **Voluntarism** - The view of the church as a voluntary association of believers; opposed as inadequate to express the church's divine constitution.
- **Confessionalism / Westminster standard** - Implicit reference point: creeds and confessions as normative guides for church constitution and practice.
- **Covenant community** - The church conceived as the covenantal people of God, whose corporate identity shapes polity and sacraments.
- **Scriptural authority** - Foundational criterion for church constitution; ecclesiastical practices must be accountable to Scripture.
- **Church-state distinction** - Affirmation of distinct spheres: civil magistrate and church each have God-given roles and limits.
- **Sacramental order** - Sacraments as instituted signs and seals embedded in the church's constitution and administered by office-bearers.
- **Authority** - Ecclesiastical authority grounded in Christ and mediated by ordained offices and courts.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for ecclesiology and the nature of church offices in Reformed teaching.
 - As a **polemic** against Erastianism and voluntarist ecclesiologies, used in debates over church discipline and denominational autonomy.
 - As a **model** for applying Scripture and confessional resources to concrete questions of Presbyterian polity, ordination, and courts.
