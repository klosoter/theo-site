### TITLE
Creation Regained: Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview - Al Wolters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in the late 20th century amid renewed interest in Reformed cultural engagement and neo-Calvinist thought; part of the broader "Reformational" movement deriving from Abraham Kuyper and Herman Dooyeweerd.
 - Responds to secularization, the sacred-secular split in both liberal and pietistic Protestantism, and a need for a coherent Christian public theology and ethics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible's grand narrative-**creation, fall, redemption**-provides the necessary framework for a Christian worldview that affirms Christ's lordship over all life and resists compartmentalization of religion and culture.
 - Theology must ground cultural, ethical, and social reflection in the creational order as renewed in Christ rather than in either purely naturalistic reason or pietistic withdrawal.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of the biblical motif of **creation-fall-redemption** as the organizing hermeneutic for theology and public life.
 - Analysis of **creation**: God as Creator establishes structures, norms, and callings for human life (cultural mandate, stewardship, vocation).
 - Analysis of **fall**: Sin corrupts human direction and uses of creation without destroying its constitutive structures.
 - Analysis of **redemption**: Christ's work restores and reorients human life and culture toward creational norms; the church participates in cultural renewal while awaiting eschatological consummation.
 - Practical implications: critiques of dualism (sacred/secular split), defense of common grace, and a program for Christian cultural engagement through vocation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed classics (Calvin, Bavinck), neo-Calvinist thought (Kuyper, Dooyeweerd), and contemporary debates in Christian ethics and public theology.
 - Engages secular modernity as philosophical and sociological phenomenon; dialogues indirectly with secular social theory and with pietistic and liberal Protestant responses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation (ontological order, creational norms), sin/fall (directional distortion), redemption/Christology (restoration and renewal), eschatology (already/not-yet), providence, common grace, vocation/calling, cultural mandate, and indirectly covenant theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Christian theology must root social, cultural, and ethical reflection in the creational order and Christ's redemptive restoration: only then does faith yield a comprehensive, public, reformational worldview.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic use of the triad **creation-fall-redemption** as the organizing principle for a worldview that is neither secular nor pietistic.
 - Strong focus on **creational norms/structures**: reality has God-given shapes and functions that persist despite the fall and are to be honored and restored.
 - Emphasis on **vocation/calling** and the cultural mandate as central to Christian life and ethics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects pietistic tendencies that privatize faith by insisting on public, cultural responsibilities of Christians.
 - Pushes back against secular modernity and reductionist natural law approaches by rooting norms in biblical creation rather than autonomous human reason.
 - Distinguishes itself from simplistic "restorationism" by acknowledging that creational structures are not annihilated by sin but disordered and thus can be rehabilitated through redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Productive integration of philosophical concepts from Reformational thought (e.g., **structure vs. direction**) into biblical theological categories.
 - Clarifies "creation" as both ontological foundation and ethical guide-creation is normative for cultural praxis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed and evangelical circles as a foundational primer for Christian cultural engagement and Reformed public theology.
 - Influenced curricula in Reformed seminaries, discussions on Christian higher education, and subsequent work on vocation and public theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, durable framework for linking biblical theology to ethics, cultural critique, and social action.
 - Serves as an accessible bridge between historical Reformed convictions and contemporary cultural-theological challenges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation**
 - God's origination and ordering of reality; source of creational norms and human vocation.
- **Creation-Fall-Redemption**
 - The tripartite hermeneutical framework organizing biblical teaching and worldview formation.
- **Creational norms / orders of creation**
 - God-given structures (e.g., family, work, political life) that govern proper human flourishing and are to be restored, not abolished.
- **Structure vs. direction**
 - Distinction: creational structures (enduring features of reality) vs. human direction (orientation that can be corrupted by sin).
- **Cultural mandate**
 - The call in Genesis to subdue and steward creation; central to Wolters' view of vocation and public engagement.
- **Vocation / calling**
 - Everyday occupations and offices as arenas of faithful service to God's creational order.
- **Common grace**
 - God's restraining and enabling work in the world that preserves creation's structures and allows for cultural goods apart from special redemption.
- **Antithesis**
 - The decisive moral and spiritual contrast between God's kingdom and the fallen world; shapes Christian cultural engagement.
- **Kingdom of God / already-not-yet**
 - Redemption is inaugurated in Christ (restorative work) but consummated eschatologically; informs measured expectations for cultural renewal.
- **Dominion / stewardship**
 - Human responsibility to govern creation under God's rule; contrasted with domination as exploitation.
- **Redemption**
 - Christ's restorative work that reorders human direction toward creational norms.
- **Eschatology**
 - Frames the hope and limits of cultural transformation; warns against utopianism.
- **Reformational worldview**
 - A Christian public philosophy that insists on Christ's lordship over all life and integrates theology with cultural praxis.
- **Secular-sacred split**
 - The problematic bifurcation Wolters critiques: religion as private versus culture as autonomous.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what constitutes a Reformational worldview and how the creation-fall-redemption schema functions.
- As a **polemic** against secularization and pietistic withdrawal-used to argue for robust Christian cultural engagement.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis and the biblical storyline into ethics and social theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses and discussions on vocation, Christian higher education, and Reformed public theology.
