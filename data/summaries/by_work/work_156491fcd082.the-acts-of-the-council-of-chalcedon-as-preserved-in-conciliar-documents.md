### TITLE
The Acts of the Council of Chalcedon (451) - conciliar documents preserving Pope Leo I's Tome and the Chalcedonian Definition

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Convened in 451 at Chalcedon (near Constantinople) under Emperor Marcian and Pulcheria amid intense East Roman Christological controversy.
 - The council records include imperial letters, episcopal signatures, the *Tome of Leo* (sent by Pope Leo I), the Chalcedonian Definition (the "Definition"), and fifty canons addressing discipline and jurisdiction.
 - The milieu: reaction to Eutychian/Monophysite tendencies and to perceived Nestorian separations; continuity with Cyril of Alexandria and the Nicene tradition.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate, against both Monophysitism and Nestorianism, the orthodox account of Christ as **one person (hypostasis) in two natures (dyophysis)** - fully God and fully man - without confusion, change, division, or separation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Preface: appeal to prior councils (Nicaea, Ephesus) and authority of bishops and emperor.
 - Reception and citation of **Leo's Tome** as a decisive exposition of the mystery.
 - The **Chalcedonian Definition** (the key formula): Christ recognized in two natures, **"without confusion, without change, without division, without separation"**, the distinction of natures preserved yet united in one person and one hypostasis.
 - Condemnations: Eutyches, Dioscorus, and formulations judged heretical; enforcement through canons (jurisdictional and disciplinary measures).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal: Pope Leo I (his Tome), Emperor Marcian, Empress Pulcheria.
 - Interlocutors/opponents: Eutyches, Dioscorus of Alexandria (deposed), Monophysite/Oriental Orthodox tradition.
 - Intellectual debts: Cyril of Alexandria (anti-Nestorian emphasis) and the language of Nicaea/Niceo-Constantinopolitan Creed.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): hypostatic union, two natures, incarnation, role/identity of the God-man.
 - **Trinity** (implications): preserves divine identity of the Son while distinguishing incarnate human reality.
 - **Ecclesiology / conciliar authority**: scope and enforcement of ecumenical decisions.

- **Closing line**
 - Chalcedon centers Christian orthodoxy on the **hypostatic union**: one Person of the Word assuming two complete natures, formulated to guard both the full divinity and full humanity of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - The famous four adverbs - **unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, inseparable** - give precision to how the two natures are related in one person.
 - Deployment of the Roman papal letter (Leo's Tome) as textual and theological pivot within a conciliar setting.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Rejects Nestorian over-separation (which risks two persons) and Eutychian Monophysitism (which swallows the humanity into the divinity).
 - Affirms Cyril's anti-Nestorian insistence on one person but rebalances with clearer metaphysical distinction of natures.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Consolidation of **dyophysitism** as orthodox vocabulary tied to the older hypostatic language; precision in how *physis* (nature) and *hypostasis* (person) relate.
 - Use of a papal theological letter (Tome) as conciliar prooftext - a precedent for papal theological authority within ecumenical discourse.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate schism: Oriental Orthodox rejection led to enduring institutional division.
 - Long-term: Chalcedon is foundational for Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and most Protestant Christologies; received in Reformed theology as the standard Christological definition.
 - Provided the doctrinal baseline for later Christological controversies (e.g., monothelitism debates) and for ecumenical conversations in modernity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, normative formula for teaching the incarnation and defending the full salvific significance of both natures.
 - Remains indispensable in dogmatics, liturgical confessions, and ecumenical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - the council formula declaring Christ in two natures without confusion, change, division, separation.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the union of two complete natures (divine and human) in one hypostasis/person (the Son); Chalcedon operationalizes this doctrine.
- **Two Natures (dyophysitism)** - Christ's full deity and full humanity retained as distinct natures after the union.
- **Four adverbs** - *unconfused, unchangeable, indivisible, inseparable*; technical limits on how natures relate.
- **Hypostasis / Person** - the single personal subject (the Word) who assumes a human nature; distinguishes person from nature.
- **Physis / Nature** - the ontology of what someone is (divine nature, human nature); Chalcedon insists on their distinction.
- **Tome of Leo** - papal letter used as authoritative exposition of the orthodox solution; pivotal in conciliar deliberation.
- **Eutychianism / Monophysitism** - doctrine asserting one (mixed) nature after the incarnation; explicitly condemned.
- **Nestorianism** - perceived dividing of Christ into two persons; Chalcedon rejects this over-separation.
- **Theotokos** - affirmation of Mary as Mother of God retained; protects divine identity of the Son in the incarnation.
- **Canons of Chalcedon** - disciplinary and jurisdictional rules appended to the Definition; shape church order.
- **Ecumenical authority** - Chalcedon as a major ecumenical council in the canonical tradition informing subsequent creedal theology.
- **Dyophysite vocabulary** - the council's consolidation of terms used by later theologians across traditions.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for systematic Christology and catechetics: normative wording for two natures doctrine.
 - As **polemic** and canonical precedent against Monophysitism and Nestorianism in theological disputation.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for discussing incarnation, atonement, and the communicatio idiomatum (how properties of natures relate).
