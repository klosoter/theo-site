### TITLE
A Comprehensive Faith: A Festschrift for Meredith G. Kline - ed. Andrew A. Sandlin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Festschrift honoring Meredith G. Kline (1922-2007), emerging from late 20th-early 21st century conservative Reformed scholarship.
 - Situated within ongoing debates over covenant theology, biblical theology, and the relation of Scripture to ancient Near Eastern (ANE) covenant forms.
 - Engages both academy and confessional church contexts-readership: pastors, scholars, advanced seminarians.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The volume defends, refines, and applies Klinean covenantal insights: that the structure and law-language of Scripture are best understood through covenantal (especially suzerainty-treaty) categories, with consequences for exegesis, ecclesiology, sacraments, and eschatology.
 - Implicit polemic against both classical dispensational readings and reductive natural-law or purely ethical readings of biblical law.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves typically present)**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of OT covenant texts (e.g., Sinai, Davidic, Abrahamic) informed by ANE treaty forms and Hebrew covenant formulae.
 - Theological synthesis: reconstructing a canonical, covenant-centered system that integrates law, worship, kingship, and typology.
 - Applied ramifications: ecclesiology (covenant succession, sacraments), Christian ethics (law's abiding covenantal role), and eschatology (covenantal consummation under the Messiah-King).
 - Methodological defense: canonical and typological reading opposed to fragmented historicist or dispensational schemas.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary focus on Meredith G. Kline's corpus: his work on suzerainty treaties, typology, and covenant structure.
 - Interacts with ANE treaty texts and scholarship on Hittite/Suzerain treaties; engages Reformational forebears (e.g., Calvin, Vos), contemporaries in Reformed orthodoxy, and critics from dispensational and some liberal circles.
 - Scripture (OT covenant passages, Pauline covenantal interpretation) is the central primary text.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and canon (canonical-covenantal hermeneutic)
 - Covenant theology (including covenant of works, grace, and the Mosaic covenant as covenant administration)
 - Law and its abiding status within covenant life
 - Christology and typology (Messianic fulfillment of covenant offices)
 - Kingship and eschatology (Davidic covenant, kingdom consummation)
 - Ecclesiology and sacramentology (covenant sign/seal continuity)
 - Brief attention to oath, treaty witnesses, blessings/curses as covenantal sanctions

- **Closing line**
 - The festschrift centers on a **kingdomal, covenantal reading of Scripture**-law and promise knitted into a legal-dramatic covenantal economy that frames God's redemptive history and the church's life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong reclaiming of the **suzerainty-treaty model** as hermeneutical tool for OT covenants, stressing legal formality and divine lordship rather than merely ethical or familial metaphors.
 - Emphasis on **covenantal administration**: distinctions among covenants as administrations of one redemptive covenant under successive mediatorial works.
 - Robust typological method: typology is ontologically groundable in covenant acts, not merely allegorical.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects dispensational compartmentalization by arguing for covenantal continuity and canonical unity.
 - Pushes back on pietistic reductions of law to ethics by restoring law's covenantal, cultic, and judicial functions.
 - Modifies classical covenant theology by sharpening legal and treaty categories rather than purely federal-legal abstractions.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Renewed deployment of ANE treaty vocabulary (suzerain, vassal, stipulations, curses) as canonical categories.
 - Framing covenant signs and sacraments within a legal-ritual covenant administration rather than only symbolic remembrance.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed and confessional circles; used by pastors/theologians arguing for covenant continuity.
 - Contested by scholars who question the primacy of ANE treaty parallels or who favor alternative canonical-historical methods.
 - Has helped reorient debates on the Mosaic covenant, Sabbath, and ecclesial boundaries.

- **Enduring value**
 - As a concentrated resource for Klinean thought: clarifies method, applies it across loci, and supplies a durable hermeneutical toolbox for covenantal exegesis and dogmatic construction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith)** - central organizing category: legal, relational, and redemptive-historical bond between God and people.
- **Suzerainty treaty** - ANE treaty form used to interpret OT covenants: suzerain (God) issues stipulations and sanctions to vassal (Israel/Church).
- **Stipulations** - covenant obligations or commands framed as treaty articles, not mere moral suggestions.
- **Witnesses and curses/blessings** - covenant enforcement mechanisms; used to read Deuteronomy and covenant renewal passages.
- **Covenant administration** - successive historical administrations (e.g., Mosaic, Davidic) of one covenantal economy.
- **Typology** - ontological correspondence rooted in covenant acts (e.g., Davidic king as type of Christ).
- **Canon-covenantal hermeneutic** - reading Scripture as unified covenantal narrative, prioritizing canonical shape and context.
- **Law as covenantal statute** - law retains binding force within covenant community as covenant stipulation, cultic and civil as well as moral.
- **Mosaic covenant** - treated as covenant administration with unique stipulations and sanctions, not a separate salvific covenant.
- **Kingship / Davidic covenant** - central for eschatology; Christ as covenant-fulfilling king.
- **Covenant succession** - doctrine of covenant continuity across generations and sacraments.
- **Sacrament as sign/seal** - baptism and Lord's Supper as covenant signs within legal-ritual administration.
- **Canonical typology vs allegory** - typology anchored to covenant acts and fulfillment.
- **Oath language / covenant formulae** - technical markers used in exegesis for covenant boundaries.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Klinean covenant theology and its legal-treaty terms.
 - As a **polemic** resource against dispensational separation and against readings that privatize law.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading OT covenant texts through ANE treaty parallels and canonical context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and Reformed ethics grounded in covenant stipulations.
