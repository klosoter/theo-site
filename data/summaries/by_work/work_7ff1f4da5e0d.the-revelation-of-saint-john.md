### TITLE
The Revelation of Saint John - Ian Boxall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary scholarly monograph/commentary situated within late-20th/early-21st-century anglophone New Testament studies.
 - Responds to literary, rhetorical, and social-historical turns in apocalypse studies; dialogues with major commentaries and interdisciplinary work (Jewish apocalyptic, Roman imperial studies, reception-historical concerns).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Revelation must be read primarily as a rhetorically shaped, theologically rich apocalypse that forms Christian identity under imperial pressure rather than as a straightforward prophetic calendar of future events.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes genre and Sitz im Leben: apocalypse as revelatory, visionary discourse produced for beleaguered communities.
 - Emphasizes literary-rhetorical features: chiastic structures, symbolic economy, and performative sequences (worship scenes, liturgical refrains).
 - Maps intertextuality with Hebrew Bible and early Jewish texts to show theological continuity and inventive reinterpretation.
 - Interprets key cycles (seven seals, trumpets, bowls) as progressive rhetorical intensifications aimed at sustaining faithful witness and calling for worship of the Lamb.
 - Concludes with theological implications for Christology, ecclesiology, and eschatology: Christ as sovereign lamb and enthroned judge, community as prophetic witness, final consummation as liturgical restoration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with major modern commentators and methods (e.g., Aune-style philological work, Beale/Bauckham's theological readings) and with older hermeneutical streams (preterist, futurist, historicist, idealist).
 - Draws extensively on Hebrew Bible, Second Temple literature, early Christian receptions, and Roman imperial realities as background.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/apocalypse, prophecy, Christology (Lamb, Son of Man, enthroned Christ), eschatology (judgment, consummation), ecclesiology (church under trial), worship/temple imagery, angelology, and canon-critical implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Boxall places Revelation at the intersection of prophetic disclosure and liturgical imagination: a rhetorical, intertextual apocalypse that re-forms Christian identity under empire by proclaiming Christ's victory and summoning worshipful witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong literary-rhetorical focus: reads structural artistry and performance features as central to theological meaning.
 - Stresses intertextual reworking of Hebrew Bible motifs rather than isolated symbolic decoding.
 - Treats worship scenes (throne-room, Lamb liturgy) as the hermeneutical key to understanding judgment and victory.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against sensationalist futurism and overly schematic dispensational readings that detach Revelation from first-century social contexts.
 - Counters reductive allegorizing or purely historical (chronological) readings by balancing historical-sociological setting with theological and literary analysis.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Advocates for reading sequences as rhetorical "intensifications" and for appreciating polyvalent symbols that function within narrative performance.
 - Emphasizes "performative apocalypse": the text not only predicts but enacts community formation and worship practices.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in academic courses as a balanced alternative between technical philology and speculative futurism.
 - Cited by scholars interested in intertextual and liturgical readings; informs preaching that seeks to historicize imperial critique without losing theological stakes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a model for integrating literary form, intertextuality, and theological exegesis; particularly useful for teaching Revelation as both theology and pastoral literature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apocalypse / apokalypsis**
 - Disclosure of divine mystery; Boxall reads it as communal revelation enacted in visions and worship.
- **Intertextuality**
 - Reuse and reinterpretation of Hebrew Bible/Second Temple texts to produce new theological meanings.
- **Symbolism / imagery**
 - Polyvalent symbols (beasts, lamb, numbers) function rhetorically within narrative sequences, not as fixed codes.
- **Rhetorical intensification**
 - Term for the book's progressive escalation of imagery and judgment to produce affective and theological force.
- **Worship / throne-room scenes**
 - Central hermeneutical key: worship frames judgment and victory; liturgy shapes identity.
- **Christology: Lamb and Son of Man**
 - Portrays Christ as sacrificial victor and enthroned judge - theologically decisive for soteriology and eschatology.
- **Empire / Rome critique**
 - Imperial symbols read as contested loci of allegiance; the text functions as political and religious critique.
- **Eschatological judgment**
 - Seen as restorative and liturgical consummation rather than merely punitive apocalypse.
- **Community / identity formation**
 - Text designed to sustain persecuted congregations' faith and mission.
- **Vision / seer (John)**
 - Prophetical seer whose visions mediate divine sovereignty to the churches.
- **Prophecy vs. Predictive futurism**
 - Boxall favors prophecy as covenantal exhortation and symbolic disclosure, not simple timeline prediction.
- **Canonical reading**
 - Treats Revelation within the sweep of Scripture, especially its dialog with Old Testament promises.
- **Performative reading**
 - The text performs theology by shaping worship and witness in its audience.
- **Angelology**
 - Angels as mediators and agents within the revelatory and liturgical economy.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplary integration of literary form, intertextuality, and theology.
 - As a **polemic**: corrective to futurist and sensationalist popular readings.
 - As a **definition source**: for understanding apocalypse as communal, performative revelation rather than only prophetic forecasting.
 - As a **teaching tool**: accessible but scholarly framework for courses on Revelation, worship, and empire-critical theology.
