### TITLE
The Covenant of Works: Its Confessional and Biblical Status (essay in The Law Is Not of Faith) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetic and confessional renewal. Collected in The Law Is Not of Faith, addressing perceived confessional drift and debates over covenant theology (responses to Klinean and revisionist readings).
 - Milieu: conservative Presbyterian/Reformed seminary discourse seeking to recover classical federalism and confessional fidelity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The classical **Covenant of Works** is both defensible biblically and embodied in Reformed confessional formulations (notably the Westminster Confession). It must be maintained as distinct from, yet related to, the Covenant of Grace.
 - Problem addressed: whether the covenant-of-works construct is a legitimate exegetical category and confessional commitment, or a later import/optionally helpful fiction.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical basis: reads Genesis 2 (and relevant Pauline theology) to show an original covenantal stipulation: life promised on condition of perfect obedience to Adam.
 - Confessional analysis: shows the Westminster Confession (and classical Reformed writers) presuppose this covenantal structure - cites language such as "promise of life upon condition of perfect obedience."
 - Theological integration:
 - Adam as federal head and type of Christ; Adam's failure makes necessary the Covenant of Grace.
 - Christ's active obedience is the decisive fulfillment vis-a-vis the covenant of works' demand.
 - Polemic moves: critiques accounts that either deny a properly covenantal reading of Genesis or collapse the covenant of works into other covenantal administrations (e.g., Mosaic law) or a mere moral principle.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary confessional source: Westminster Confession of Faith.
 - Engages classical Reformed writers (Calvin, the Westminster divines) and modern interpreters such as Meredith Kline and various revisionist covenant theologians.
 - Uses Pauline theology (esp. Romans 5 typology) and patristic/medieval notions of representation where helpful.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works & grace), federal headship and representation, Christology (active obedience and fulfillment), soteriology, law and its relation to gospel, typology.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin insists the covenant-of-works construct is both biblically warranted and confessional, serving as the necessary foil to appreciate the Covenant of Grace and Christ's representative, covenant-fulfilling work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong confessional hermeneutic: reads Scripture through the lens of the Reformed confessions rather than treating confession as optional commentary.
 - Emphasizes **Christ's active obedience** as the positive fulfillment of what Adam failed to secure under the covenant of works.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Klinean treaty-typology excesses and against revisionists who minimize or deny a covenant of works founded in Genesis.
 - Argues against reducing the covenant of works to merely a natural law or non-covenantal moral order.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not novel in coinage but insists on precise use of "covenant" language: distinguishes covenant-of-works from subsequent covenant administrations and from contractual/treaty metaphors when they mislead.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed circles as a corrective to covenant-theology revisionism.
 - Adopted in seminary syllabi and confessional argumentation; provoked further dialog with Klinean and post-Klinean scholars.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the confessional witness and offers a compact, disciplined resource for teaching Adam-Christ typology, federal headship, and the structure of redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - The original stipulation made with Adam: life promised upon condition of perfect obedience.
- **Covenant of Grace** - The redemptive covenant instituted after the fall; distinguished from but related to the covenant of works.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative head; Christ as the covenantal head who succeeds where Adam failed.
- **Active Obedience** - Christ's positive fulfillment of the law's demands; crucial for answering the covenant-of-works requirement.
- **Westminster Confession of Faith** - Primary confessional warrant Gaffin uses to demonstrate doctrinal continuity.
- **Genesis 2:17 / Adamic stipulation** - Key exegetical locus for identifying a works-based covenantal structure.
- **Typology (Adam-Christ)** - Interprets Adam as a type whose failure is rectified by Christ's obedience.
- **Klinean treaty model** - Contrasted with Gaffin's cautionary reading; Gaffin resists overreliance on ancient Near Eastern treaty analogies.
- **Law vs. Gospel** - The covenant of works is tied to law's demand; covenant of grace to gospel provision.
- **Penalty / Reward language** - Death as penalty for breach; life as promised reward for obedience.
- **Confessional hermeneutic** - Methodological posture: Scripture read in continuity with confessional formulations.
- **Representative substitution** - The mechanism by which Christ's fulfillment effects believers' standing before God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **confessional definition** resource to locate the covenant of works within the Westminster tradition.
- As a **polemic** against covenant-theology revisions (e.g., extreme treaty models or denials of an Adamic covenant).
- As an **exegetical model** for Adam-Christ typology and Pauline readings (esp. Romans 5).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in soteriology: framing Christ's active obedience as the solution to the covenant-of-works demand.
