### TITLE
The Person of Christ - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Mid‑17th century Puritan England; Owen (1616-1683) writing amid post‑Reformation Reformed scholasticism and controversies with Arminians, Socinians, and remnants of Roman scholasticism. Intent: to systematize orthodox Christology for pastoral and polemical use.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To demonstrate the true personhood and sinlessness of Christ - especially the doctrine of **impeccability** - and to show how Christ's humanity is genuinely tempted yet incapable of sin by virtue of the hypostatic union, sanctifying grace, and absence of original sin.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of what it means for Christ to be a divine person assuming a true human nature (hypostatic union) and the implications for properties and acts.
 - Definition and analysis of peccability vs. impeccability: what it would mean for a nature to be "able to sin" and whether Christ's human nature possessed such ability.
 - Examination of the human will(s) of Christ, freedom, and voluntary agency - distinguishing temptability from peccability.
 - Scriptural and philosophical proofs that Christ was tempted but did not, could not, sin - appeal to Hebrews 4:15, Pauline soteriology, and logical implications of union with the divine person.
 - Polemic against those who claim Christ must have been able to sin for his obedience to be meritorious or for real solidarity with sinners.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Hebrews, Philippians, John), patristic and medieval formulations of the hypostatic union, Reformed scholastics, and opponents including Socinians/Arminians and some medieval scholastic positions; Owen dialogues implicitly with Aquinian categories but recasts them in Reformed pneumatology and covenantal soteriology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and natures, communicatio idiomatum), Trinity (as the ground of the union), soteriology (active and passive obedience, merit, atonement), anthropology (original sin, concupiscence), will and liberty.
- **Closing line:** Owen centers the work on the claim that because the eternal Son assumed a sinless human nature, united personally to the divine person and indwelt by sanctifying grace, Christ was **temptable but not peccable** - genuinely human in suffering and trial, yet incapable of transgression.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Sharp distinction between *temptability* (experiencing solicitation) and *peccability* (possibility of committing sin); Owen insists Christ truly experienced temptation without any internal corruption that would render sin actual.
 - Emphasis on the **hypostatic union as efficacious** in preventing sin: the divine person does not merely observe but secures the sinlessness of the assumed human nature.
 - Use of forensic and covenantal language: Christ's obedience is meritorious because of his person and covenant role, not because he faced a metaphysical possibility of falling.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against any theory that imputes to Christ a fallen human disposition (e.g., that he had concupiscence or inherited corruption).
 - Rebuttal to those who argue that real merit requires real possibility of sin; Owen shows merit rests on person, not on contingency of fall.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Precise operationalization of peccability vs. impeccability within a Reformed framework; systematic linking of union, sanctifying grace, and absence of original sin as a single explanatory cluster.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and Puritan circles; used as a standard Protestant defense of Christ's sinlessness. In subsequent Reformed theology it shaped treatments of Christ's active obedience and the nature of his human will.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Valuable for advanced students for its analytical rigor on will, union, and sinlessness; remains a primary resource for debates about temptability, solidarity with sinners, and the nature of merit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** The doctrine that Christ could not sin; Owen argues it is true by virtue of personal union and absence of original corruption.
- **Peccability:** The potential capacity of a nature to commit sin; distinguished from mere exposure to temptation.
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of divine and human natures in the one person of the Son; Owen treats this as the decisive ground for Christ's sinlessness.
- **Temptability:** Christ's genuine experience of external and internal temptations without internal sinful inclination.
- **Original Sin / Concupiscence:** Owen denies Christ had original sin or concupiscence; absence of these removes internal propensity to sin.
- **Active Obedience:** Christ's positive, willing obedience to the law; Owen defends its merit independent of any metaphysical capacity to fall.
- **Passive Obedience:** Christ's suffering and death; distinguished but related to his sinless submission.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** Communication of properties between natures; used to explain how human acts belong to the divine person.
- **Person vs. Nature:** Owen stresses that impeccability attaches to the person (the assumed human nature in union with the Son) rather than to the unassisted human nature abstractly.
- **Sanctifying Grace (Infused Habit):** The real habitual sanctification in Christ's human nature preventing sin.
- **Freedom of the Will:** Owen affirms genuine human voluntariness in Christ, yet without disordered inclination to sin.
- **Merit / Forensic Efficacy:** Owen argues merit lies in the obedient act of the divine person, not in the contingency of possible sin.
- **Solidarity with Sinners:** Owen explains how Christ's temptations assure real sympathy without compromising impeccability.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitive source** for the Reformed definition and defense of Christ's impeccability and the related distinctions (temptability vs peccability).
- As a **polemic resource** against theories that attribute original corruption or real peccability to Christ.
- As an **exegetical-model** for Hebrews 4:15 and Pauline texts about Christ's obedience in systematic soteriology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of active obedience, the merit of Christ, and how the hypostatic union secures both identification with sinners and sinlessness.
