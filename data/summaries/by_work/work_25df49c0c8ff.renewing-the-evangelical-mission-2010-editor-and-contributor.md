### TITLE
Renewing the Evangelical Mission (2010), ed. and contrib. Richard Lints

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a post-2000 evangelical environment anxious about cultural marginalization, consumerized religion, and loss of intellectual credibility.
 - Represents Reformed-evangelical attempts to recover doctrinal resources for robust public witness and sustained mission in pluralistic societies.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelical mission requires theological renewal: mission must be re-grounded in a robust doctrinal framework (particularly trinitarian theology and the Imago Dei) to avoid pragmatism, privatized faith, or social-reform reductionism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Intro: critique of contemporary evangelical practice (pragmatism, reduction of mission to programs).
 - Theological retrieval: chapters recover classical doctrines (Trinity, revelation, Christology, Imago Dei) as normative foundations for mission.
 - Cultural and ecclesial application: proposals for vocation, public witness, and church life shaped by these doctrines.
 - Practical epilogue: strategies for training leaders, shaping congregations, and re-forming habits of witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Augustine, Calvin, and Kuyper for resources on vocation, common grace, and culture; engages Barthian emphases on Word and revelation; converses with contemporary evangelicals (critique of pragmatism and pietism), and addresses secular pluralism and postmodern critiques.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Image of God (Imago Dei)** - explicit locus for linking anthropology and vocation (site cited).
 - Trinity and Missio Dei - grounds mission in God's life.
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture - norming mission and message.
 - Christology, ecclesiology, vocation, common grace, and eschatology - all marshaled for a coherent mission theology.
- **Closing line**
 - The work argues that authentic evangelical mission is a doctrinally shaped vocation: humans as Imago Dei called by the triune God into public, cultural, and ecclesial service oriented by gospel proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic recovery: places classical doctrinal loci (esp. Imago Dei and Trinitarian doctrine) at the center of practical missiology rather than as peripheral anthropology.
 - Integration of doctrine and cultural engagement: Imago Dei understood as both relational (reflecting the triune life) and vocational (calling to cultivate creation).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pragmatic, program-driven mission strategies common in late 20th-century evangelicalism.
 - Contrasts with social-gospel reductionism by insisting proclamation and doctrinal fidelity remain primary, while refusing to neglect social and cultural responsibilities.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a vocational reading of the Imago Dei (human identity as call and task), linking it more directly to public theology and cultural vocation than some prior evangelical accounts.
 - Stresses "renewal" as doctrinal retraining rather than merely organizational reform.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in Reformed-evangelical academic and pastoral circles as a corrective resource; used in seminary reading lists on mission and theological retrieval.
 - Less traction among non-Reformed evangelicals who prioritize parachurch practice over doctrinal reform.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teachers and pastors seeking to connect doctrine to mission practice; durable as a bridge between systematic theology and missiology in evangelical curricula.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - central anthropological motif; here read as relational (reflecting triune life) and vocational (tasked to steward creation).
 - Used to ground human dignity, public responsibility, and cultural vocation.
- **Missio Dei** - mission as originating in the triune God; mission of the church derives from God's own sending.
- **Trinitarian theology** - provides ontological basis for relational human identity and communal vocation.
- **Vocation** - human calling in all spheres (church, family, polity, culture) as expression of Imago Dei.
- **Common grace** - framework for engaging culture and non-Christian goods without syncretism.
- **Cultural mandate** - renewed emphasis on human labor and public order as theological responsibilities.
- **Proclamation vs. service** - insists on primacy of the gospel word while integrating faithful social witness.
- **Theological retrieval** - methodological commitment to recover historic doctrinal resources for contemporary mission.
- **Public theology** - cultivation of Christian witness in civic and cultural institutions grounded in doctrine.
- **Ecclesiology** - church as sent community shaped by doctrine for mission formation.
- **Reformational/Kuyperian influence** - intellectual lineage informing cultural-engagement strategy.
- **Pragmatism (critique)** - diagnosis of contemporary evangelical failure; targeted for correction.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Imago Dei to public vocation and cultural engagement in theological curricula.
- As a **polemic** against evangelical pragmatism and privatized faith in pastoral and missional training.
- As a **definition source** for interdisciplinary courses (theology + mission), supplying theological rationale for social and cultural ministry.
