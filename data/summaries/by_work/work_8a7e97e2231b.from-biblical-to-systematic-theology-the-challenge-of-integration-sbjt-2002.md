### TITLE
From Biblical to Systematic Theology: The Challenge of Integration (SBJT, 2002) - Stephen Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2002 in the Southern Baptist Journal of Theology during a period of renewed evangelical interest in biblical-theological methods.
 - Situated within Reformed-evangelical conversations about how to keep systematic theology faithful to the Bible's redemptive-historical shape (post-Vosian revival, alongside voices like Goldsworthy, Childs, Beale).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The chief task is methodological: how to integrate *biblical theology* (the Scripture-shaped, diachronic telling of God's redemptive work) with *systematic theology* (the synoptic, doctrinal articulation of truth).
 - Wellum argues that systematic theology must be disciplined and informed by biblical theology; integration requires rules and a coherent hermeneutical posture so doctrines remain true to the canonical storyline.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern systematic theology often abstracts doctrines from biblical history, producing timeless propositions detached from the narrative of revelation.
 - Principles of integration:
 - Start with the biblical storyline (promise-fulfillment, covenantal progression) as the primary data.
 - Employ typology and redemptive-historical continuity to move from biblical particulars to doctrinal loci.
 - Preserve both diachronic integrity (how revelation unfolds) and synchronic synthesis (how doctrines cohere).
 - Methodological moves:
 - Clarify the role of canonical final form and the normative center in Christ.
 - Distinguish descriptive-historical claims from normative theological claims.
 - Provide guardrails for extracting universal doctrinal truth from covenantal stages.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit interlocutors include Geerhardus Vos (redemptive history), Brevard Childs (canonical theology), and contemporary biblical-theology proponents (e.g., Goldsworthy, Beale).
 - Engages classic Reformed commitments (covenant theology, Christocentrism) and raises them to methodological prominence.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Scripture and revelation (hermeneutics, canonical shape)
 - Covenant and redemptive-historical progression
 - Christology (centrality of Christ as fulfillment)
 - Soteriology, ecclesiology, and eschatology as examples of loci requiring biblical-theological grounding
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Systematic theology must be an orderly, doctrinal doxology that both emerges from and faithfully corresponds to the Bible's redemptive-historical testimony, with Christ as the hermeneutical center.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes *methodical translation* from narrative/typological data to doctrinal loci; not merely a claim that biblical theology matters, but a program for how to let it shape systematic construction.
 - Strong insistence on Christ as the canonical center that regulates doctrinal synthesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects ahistorical abstractions in some systematic theologies by returning to covenantal and redemptive-historical particularity.
 - Balances Vosian diachronic development with a canonical-synchronic concern to produce unified doctrine (seeks a middle path between raw historical sequencing and abstract canonical reading).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Practical emphasis on "rules of theological retrieval" (principles for carrying truth across covenantal stages).
 - Use of typology as a disciplined doctrinal bridge rather than loose allegory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminary contexts as a corrective to doctrinal abstraction.
 - Cited in curricula and articles concerned with methodological fidelity between exegesis and dogmatics; has shaped teaching on integrating exegesis and confessional theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastors and students who require a principled method for deriving doctrine from Scripture's storyline.
 - Remains a concise programmatic statement for those wanting to keep systematic theology tethered to redemptive history.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology** - the discipline that traces the unfolding of divine revelation within Scripture's historical and canonical progression.
- **Systematic theology** - the discipline that synthesizes biblical truth into coherent doctrinal loci.
- **Integration** - methodological work of moving from narrative/typology to doctrinal synthesis while preserving both history and universality.
- **Canonical center / Christocentrism** - the principle that Christ is the hermeneutical and doctrinal focal point of Scripture and doctrine.
- **Redemptive-historical progression** - the covenantal, promise-fulfillment sequence by which revelation unfolds.
- **Typology** - the theological mechanism for reading earlier covenantal figures/events as foreshadowing Christ; used as a disciplined bridge to doctrine.
- **Rules of theological retrieval** - proposed guardrails for extracting universal doctrinal claims from covenantal-stage texts.
- **Diachronic vs. synchronic** - distinction between development-through-time (biblical theology) and systematized, atemporal doctrine (systematic).
- **Normative extraction** - the process of discerning doctrinal norms from descriptive biblical events and narratives.
- **Hermeneutical posture** - the interpretive stance (canonical, Christ-centered, covenant-aware) that governs reading and integration.
- **Exegetical precedent** - the idea that careful exegesis of key texts should set the pattern for doctrinal formulation.
- **Doctrinal loci** - the classical categories (e.g., Christology, soteriology) into which biblical-theological data must be organized.
- **Typological fulfillment / antitype** - language for how Christ fulfills earlier types, crucial for theological inference.
- **Reductive abstraction** - a critique term for systems that sever doctrines from biblical history.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source** for courses linking exegesis and dogmatics.
 - As a **polemic** against ahistorical or overly rationalized systematic theologies.
 - As an **exegetical-to-doctrinal model**: a practical template for deriving loci (e.g., Christology, soteriology) from the canonical storyline.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed/evangelical curricula to affirm covenantal, Christ-centered theological method.
