### TITLE
The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon - Lee Martin McDonald

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century historical-critical scholarship addressing canonical history; responds to both conservative claims of an early, fixed canon and minimalist models that deny coherent formation.
 - Situated within patristic studies, textual history, and canonical criticism; engages archaeological, epigraphic, and manuscript evidence.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Christian biblical canon is best understood as a protracted, multifaceted historical process of recognition and delimitation rather than a single decisive act; the problem is to explain how authoritative Scripture emerged without presupposing its prior full theological status.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Traces stages of development: early Christian literary production and private collections (esp. Pauline letters) → wider circulation and use in churches → liturgical and catechetical use → patristic citation and list-making → regional consensus and eventual general recognition by late antiquity.
 - Emphasizes criteria operative in communities: **apostolicity**, **orthodoxy**, **catholicity**, and **use** (liturgical and teaching).
 - Argues for a model of **local recognition leading to wider consensus**, not instantaneous universal closure.
 - Uses patristic evidence (lists, citations, controversies) + documentary fragments (Muratorian, Festal Letter of Athanasius) to date and contextualize stages.
 - Concludes that final contours solidified in the fourth century but that canonical consciousness continued to develop.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic witnesses: **Irenaeus, Origen, Eusebius, Athanasius, Jerome**, plus disputed lists and fragments (e.g., Muratorian Fragment).
 - Modern interlocutors: canonical historians and textual critics (critical engagement with positions that claim very early or very late closure).
 - Comparative reference to **Jewish scriptural formation** (Septuagint, Jewish use) to illuminate Christian parallels and divergences.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** and the grounds of scriptural authority.
 - **Ecclesiology** insofar as communities recognize and transmit authoritative texts.
 - **Tradition vs. Scripture**: the interplay between lived communal practice and textual normativity.
 - Implications for **biblical theology** and the doctrine of inspiration.

- **Closing line**
 - McDonald's theological center: the canon is a historically achieved authority - a communal, criterial recognition of texts that consolidates the church's claim to Scripture without collapsing history into dogma.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the primacy of *use* (liturgical and pedagogical practice) as decisive in recognition; canonical authority grows from ecclesial reception.
 - Nuanced rejection of both the "fixed from the beginning" thesis and radical relativizing views that deny any coherent process.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects simplistic readings that date a closed New Testament canon to the second century.
 - Contrasts with views that treat canon formation as purely top-down (ecclesiastical imposition) by privileging grassroots patterns of collection and circulation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Stresses the distinction between **collection** (gathering of writings) and **canon** (recognized rule of faith).
 - Frames canonization as a **process of recognition** rather than a singular canonical event.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in academic canon studies; influential for historians of the early church and for theological reflection on authority.
 - In Reformed circles: used cautiously - valued for historical detail but sometimes critiqued by those wanting a stronger doctrinal account of canonical certainty.
 - Broader theological impact: shapes curricula in canon theology, patristics, and systematic treatments of Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a dense, evidence-driven map of how communities historically discerned sacred texts.
 - Serves as a corrective to both naïve traditionalism and reductionist skepticism; ideal for teaching the history-theology nexus.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon** - the set of writings recognized as normative; for McDonald, an achieved communal recognition.
- **Canonicity** - the status conferred by ecclesial reception according to criteria and practice.
- **Collection** - intermediate stage when writings circulate as grouped corpora (e.g., Pauline letters).
- **Apostolicity** - criterion measuring connection to the apostles or their immediate circle.
- **Orthodoxy** - theological conformity to rule of faith and accepted teaching.
- **Catholicity** - broad, cross-regional acceptance; helps move local recognition toward general consensus.
- **Use** - liturgical, catechetical, and instructional deployment that grounds recognition.
- **Patristic citations / lists** - primary evidentiary base (e.g., Muratorian Fragment, Athanasius 39th Festal Letter).
- **Septuagint** - precedent in Jewish-Christian scriptural formation; shows model of translation/collection influencing Christians.
- **Canonization** - the historical process or series of acts resulting in formal recognition.
- **Recognition model** - McDonald's preferred framework: local acceptance → regional agreement → general consensus.
- **Collection vs. Canon distinction** - clarifies stages and avoids conflating grouping with normative closure.
- **Criteria of acceptance** - apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, and use summarized as operational tests.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **historical-definition source** for courses on canon and tradition (maps development and evidence).
 - As a **polemic resource** against claims of instantaneous canonical closure or purely ecclesiastical imposition.
 - As an **exegetical / hermeneutical model** for understanding why certain books shaped theological trajectories and how reception informs authority.
