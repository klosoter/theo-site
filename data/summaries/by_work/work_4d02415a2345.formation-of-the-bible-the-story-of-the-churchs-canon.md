### TITLE
Formation of the Bible: The Story of the Church's Canon - Lee Martin McDonald

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century historical and canonical scholarship; ecumenical, historically informed approach used in seminaries and undergraduate courses.
 - McDonald writes as a historically minded evangelical scholar engaging patristic, Jewish, and canonical studies to address both academic and church audiences.
 - Site usage here: 1 reference spanning 1 topic - **Canon And Tradition**.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical canon is not the product of a single decisive act or purely divine fiat external to the church; it is the result of a prolonged, communal, and contested process of recognition within the life of the church, guided by historic criteria and shaped by theological controversy and liturgical practice.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Surveys Old Testament canon formation in Jewish contexts (Septuagint, Palestinian vs. Alexandrian usages).
 - Traces New Testament development: early Christian writings, disputed books, lists (Muratorian fragment), and patristic testimony.
 - Analyzes criteria employed (apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, liturgical/vocabulary use, perceived inspiration).
 - Examines external pressures: heresiology (e.g., Marcion), doctrinal controversies, and ecclesiastical politics.
 - Demonstrates regional variation and gradual convergence culminating in authoritative recognition (e.g., Athanasius' 39th festal letter, councils of Hippo/Cartage).
 - Emphasizes communal reception (ecclesial praxis) as the decisive matrix for canonicity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic witnesses: Irenaeus, Origen, Athanasius, Eusebius, Jerome, Augustine; Marcion as a negative foil.
 - Documentary evidence: lists (Muratorian), council documents, liturgical lectionaries, manuscript transmission.
 - Engages contemporary scholars in canonical studies, Jewish studies, and church history.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, authority)
 - Tradition and ecclesiology (role of the church in recognition)
 - Hermeneutics (canon as interpretive norm)
 - Indirectly touches on covenant and Christology insofar as they shape criteria of orthodoxy.

- **Closing line**
 - McDonald locates the authority of the Bible in the church's historically situated exercise of discernment: biblical books were recognized, not conjured, by a believing community guided by apostolic connection, doctrinal fitness, liturgical use, and obedience to tradition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Canon as an ecclesial and communal achievement rooted in liturgical and interpretive practice rather than mere clerical fiat or private inspiration.
 - Strong empirical synthesis of manuscript, liturgical, and patristic evidence mapped across regions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters simplistic claims that canon was fixed by a single council or that it is merely the inevitable result of divine predetermination divorced from human agency.
 - Moderates both Protestant caricatures (purely spontaneous reception) and caricatures of institutional monopoly (magisterial imposition), advocating a mediated, reciprocal model between Scripture and church.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the language of "recognition" and "reception" over "creation" of the canon.
 - Systematic articulation of practical criteria (use, apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, inspiration) as historically operative, not merely theological ideals.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted as a textbook across evangelical, Reformed, and mainline seminary courses on canon and church history.
 - Respected across traditions for careful documentation; used by subsequent canonical critics and theologians exploring the interplay of Scripture and tradition.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous, evidence-based history of canon formation without reductionist apologetics.
 - Serves as a balanced resource for teaching, ecumenical dialogue, and theological reflection on authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - The list of books recognized as Scripture; for McDonald, a product of recognition within church life.
- **Canonization**
 - The historical process by which books achieved canonical status; gradual, contested, and regional.
- **Recognition / Reception**
 - Terminology stressed to show the church's role in discerning rather than creating the canon.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Criterion assessing a book's connection to the apostles or their circle.
- **Orthodoxy (Rule of Faith)**
 - Criterion assessing doctrinal conformity to the church's core teaching; used to exclude heterodox works.
- **Catholicity**
 - Wide acceptance across churches and regions; not necessarily Roman Catholic but universal usage in the early church.
- **Liturgical Use / Praxis**
 - Practical adoption in worship and teaching; a primary index of a book's functional authority.
- **Inspiration**
 - Perceived divine origin; historically ascribed to books over time as they were received.
- **Muratorian Fragment**
 - Early canonical list used as evidence for developing New Testament boundaries.
- **Septuagint**
 - Greek OT corpus influential in Christian canon formation; key to debates over the Apocrypha/Deuterocanonical books.
- **Apocrypha / Deuterocanonical**
 - Books with disputed status between Jewish/Christian communities; illustrative of regional canonicity differences.
- **Patristic Evidence**
 - Writings of the Fathers used to track usage and acceptance.
- **Councils of Hippo/Cartage; Athanasius' 39th Festal Letter**
 - Milestones in the history of recognition though not sole decisive acts.
- **Heresiology (e.g., Marcion)**
 - Theological controversy driving clarity about authoritative texts.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional and historical source in canonical and church-history courses (how the canon formed).
 - As a polemical resource in debates about sola scriptura vs. magisterial authority (showing mediated reception).
 - As an exegetical and theological model: use of canon as normative interpreter (canon as rule of faith and practice).
