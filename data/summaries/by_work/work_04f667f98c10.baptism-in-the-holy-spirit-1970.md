### TITLE
**Baptism in the Holy Spirit** (1970) - James D. G. Dunn 
A New Testament study arguing that Spirit-baptism is the eschatological gift that constitutes Christian initiation, not a post-conversion second blessing.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid the 1960s-70s Pentecostal and emerging charismatic renewal debates.
 - British NT scholarship influenced by redaction-critical methods and salvation-historical readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: In the NT, to be baptized in the Holy Spirit is to become a Christian; Spirit-baptism coincides with conversion-initiation and incorporation into Christ, not a subsequent experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Terminology and texts: The Baptist's promise of Spirit-baptism (Matt 3:11; Mark 1:8; Luke 3:16; John 1:33) fulfilled at Pentecost (Acts 2) and applied to believers as their initiation reality (Acts; 1 Cor 12:13).
 - Paul: Receiving the Spirit is definitive for belonging to Christ (Rom 8:9-11); Spirit-baptism equals incorporation into the one body (1 Cor 12:13).
 - Luke-Acts: Subsequence episodes (Acts 8; 10; 19) are salvation-historical irregularities marking stages of inclusion and apostolic unity, not normative ordo salutis.
 - Tongues and signs: Not required initial evidence; function as revelatory signs of inclusion at key redemptive-historical moments (Acts 2; 10; 19).
 - Initiation complex: Faith, water-baptism, and gift of the Spirit belong together as a conversion-initiation complex, variously ordered but theologically one.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Pentecostal and Keswick/second-blessing advocates; interacts with non-Pentecostal evangelicals (e.g., John Stott) and NT scholars (e.g., C. K. Barrett).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**; **Regeneration and Indwelling** (Rom 8); **Spirit and Union with Christ** (1 Cor 12:13); **Spirit in Redemptive History** (Joel 2; Ezek 36-37 fulfilled at Acts 2); **Revelation and Illumination** (confessing Jesus as Lord, 1 Cor 12:3; prophetic speech, 1 Cor 14).
- **Closing line**
 - Theologically: the Spirit is the eschatological gift who unites to Christ and his body at conversion; pastorally: seek ongoing fillings and gifts, but deny a two-stage Christianity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong identification of Spirit-baptism with conversion-initiation and ecclesial incorporation.
 - Coherent Luke-Paul synthesis against a bifurcated canon.
 - Salvation-historical reading that explains narrative irregularities without making them normative.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Pentecostal subsequence and tongues-as-initial-evidence; for one-stage initiation with multiple fillings.
 - Against reduction of Spirit to rite: resists collapsing Spirit into water-baptism or ordination; emphasizes experiential and charismatic dimensions within initiation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Terminological pairing: **conversion-initiation complex** to hold faith, water-baptism, and Spirit-gift together.
 - Distinction between **normative pattern** and **redemptive-historical anomalies** in Acts.
 - Equating **Spirit-baptism** with **incorporation into Christ** (1 Cor 12:13) as the controlling text.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard non-Pentecostal evangelical critique of second-blessing theology, often cited with Stott's Baptism and Fullness.
 - Used by Reformed theologians to ground union-with-Christ pneumatology and to integrate Acts within a redemptive-historical hermeneutic.
 - Pentecostal scholars have responded by defending Luke's distinct soteriological pattern, ensuring ongoing debate.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of text-driven, salvation-historical exegesis.
 - Clarifies pastoral expectations: welcomes gifts and repeated fillings while guarding against two-tier ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism in the Holy Spirit**: The eschatological gift of the Spirit that constitutes becoming a Christian; not a post-conversion enduement (Acts 2; 1 Cor 12:13).
- **Conversion-initiation complex**: Dunn's umbrella for faith, water-baptism, and Spirit-reception as one theological event, variably sequenced narratively.
- **Subsequence (qualified)**: In Acts 8 and 19, a temporary, salvation-historical delay serving ecclesial unity and inclusion; not a normative second stage.
- **Initial evidence**: Tongues in Acts function as inclusionary signs at key junctures, not as universal evidence of Spirit-baptism (Acts 2; 10; 19).
- **Union with Christ / incorporation**: Spirit-baptism brings believers into Christ's body (1 Cor 12:13); to lack the Spirit is to not belong to Christ (Rom 8:9).
- **Indwelling**: The Spirit's abiding presence marking new-covenant life (Rom 8:9-11; 1 Cor 6:19); distinguished from repeated fillings for service.
- **Regeneration / new birth**: Concept realized by receiving the Spirit; Johannine term, Pauline reality (John 3; Titus 3:5; Rom 8).
- **Seal and arrabon**: Spirit as seal and down payment of the inheritance, identifying initiation and future hope (Eph 1:13-14; 4:30; 2 Cor 1:22).
- **Revelation and illumination**: Spirit grants recognition of Jesus as Lord and inspires prophetic speech (1 Cor 12:3; 14); illumination accompanies conversion and ongoing instruction.
- **Redemptive-historical fulfillment**: Pentecost as fulfillment of promise (Joel 2; Ezek 36-37), inaugurating the last days and structuring Acts' pattern.
- **Luke-Paul coherence**: Narrative and epistolary witnesses agree that receiving the Spirit is constitutive of Christian existence.
- **Laying on of hands**: Occasional mediating sign of unity and recognition in transitional episodes; not sacramentally necessary for Spirit-gift (Acts 8; 19).
- **Charismata**: Gifts integral to the life of the initiated community, diversified by the one Spirit (1 Cor 12-14).
- **Water-baptism relation**: Ordinarily conjoined with Spirit-gift and faith, yet not mechanically causative; together express initiation.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definition source for Spirit-baptism within soteriology and ecclesiology.
 - As a polemical and pastoral resource against two-stage sanctification and tongues-as-mandatory-evidence.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Acts within redemptive history and aligning Luke with Paul.
 - As a conceptual pivot for integrating union with Christ, regeneration/indwelling, and illumination under the one gift of the Spirit.
