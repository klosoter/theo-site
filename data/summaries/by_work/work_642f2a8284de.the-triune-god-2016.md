### TITLE
**The Triune God (2016)** - Fred Sanders 
New Studies in Dogmatics series, evangelical ressourcement in pro-Nicene trinitarian theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Mid-2010s retrieval of classical theism within evangelical and Reformed circles; conversation partner with patristic resourcement and chastened use of Rahners Rule after Barthian revisions.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The doctrine of the Trinity arises from the missions of the Son and Spirit in Scripture and is anchored in their eternal processions; dogmatics must move from economy to immanence without collapse, articulating **eternal generation** and **spiration** as the ontological ground of the gospel.

- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Revelation**: OT adumbrations and NT disclosure of Father, Son, Spirit; names, sendings, and operations reveal the triune life.
 - OT: monotheism with anticipations; NT: baptismal formulae, Johannine missions, Pauline benedictions.
 - **From missions to processions**: The sent Son is eternally begotten; the poured-out Spirit eternally proceeds. Economic missions are true revelations of immanent relations.
 - **Pro-Nicene grammar**: **Homoousios**, **inseparable operations**, **appropriations**, **taxis** from the Father.
 - **Ontological vs economic Trinity**: Affirm Rahners Rule properly construed; reject identity-collapse that erases mystery or taxis.
 - **Pneumatology**: Full **person and deity of the Holy Spirit**; Western filioque as a way to confess the Spirits relation while preserving the Father as the fons.
 - **Critiques/clarifications**: 
 - Against social-trinitarian functionalism. 
 - Correction of Barthian actualism where it blurs immanent missions-processions relations. 
 - Correction of Van Tils one-person-of-God language as category error; God is one being in three persons.
 - **Dogmatic payoff**: Doctrinal coherence for Christology, soteriology, and worship grounded in eternal relations of origin.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Scripture (John, Matthew 28:19, Gal 4, Rom 8, 2 Cor 13:14); Fathers (Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Hilary); medievals (Aquinas); moderns (Barth, Rahner; critiques of Jenson, Moltmann); evangelical/Reformed debates (Van Til).

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 **Revelation and canon**, **Trinity** (immanent/economic), **Christology** (Sonship), **Pneumatology** (procession, deity), **Divine simplicity**, **Inseparable operations**, **Worship and doxology**.

- **Closing line:** 
 Trinitarian dogmatics confesses that the gospel manifests who God eternally is: the Father who begets the Son and breathes the Spirit, one God whose missions reveal his processions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Tight linkage of **missions-processions** as the hermeneutical key for reading Scripture theologically.
 - Clear, pedagogical retrieval of **inseparable operations** alongside **appropriations** and **taxis**.
 - Evangelical-friendly but rigorously **pro-Nicene** account of **eternal generation** and **spiration** (with a restrained, Western filioque).

- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - **Rahners Rule** affirmed yet fenced: the economic reveals the immanent without exhausting or collapsing it.
 - **Barths reformulation** queried where act-identity threatens eternal relations of origin.
 - **Van Til**: rejects one-person language for God as misleading; insists on three persons, one essence.
 - Pushback against social Trinitarian analogies and relational projections.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-centering **names, sendings, and operations** as the biblical pathway to ontology.
 - Didactic framing of **from missions to processions** as a rule of method.
 - Clarified usage of **theologia/oikonomia** within a single, ordered account of revelation.

- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and evangelical dogmatics as a standard pro-Nicene primer.
 - Cited in debates on **eternal generation** recovery and on the legitimacy of the **filioque**.
 - Serves as a corrective in discussions shaped by Barthian actualism and social models.

- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact, Scripture-soaked map of classical trinitarian grammar.
 - Offers a stable framework for catechesis, preaching, and systematic coherence across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Missions**: Historical sendings of Son and Spirit; cognitive access point to God.
- **Processions**: Eternal relations of origin; **generation** of the Son, **spiration** of the Spirit.
- **Eternal generation**: The Son eternally from the Father; grounds filiation and consubstantiality.
- **Spiration**: The Spirits eternal origin; Western account includes filioque while maintaining the Father as fount.
- **Filioque**: Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son; used to confess consubstantial communion and missions-processions fit.
- **Taxis**: Order of persons from the Father; structures missions and appropriations without subordinationism.
- **Inseparable operations**: One external work of the one God; distinct personal modes according to **taxis**.
 - Paired with **appropriations**: pedagogic ascriptions that fit personal properties.
- **Theologia / Oikonomia**: Immanent vs economic Trinity; distinguished, not divided.
- **Rahners Rule**: The economic is the immanent and vice versa; to be applied without collapse.
- **Barths reformulation**: Actualist identification of God and act; engaged critically to safeguard relations of origin.
- **Ontological vs economic Trinity**: Being in God vs self-disclosure in history; method moves from economy to ontology.
- **Pro-Nicene**: Doctrinal synthesis of 4th-century orthodoxy; homoousios with personal relations.
- **Homoousios**: Consubstantiality of the three; secures unity amid real distinctions.
- **Person (hypostasis)**: Irreducible trinitarian identities; contrasts with Van Tils problematic one-person phrasing.

- **How this work is used:**
 - **Definition source** for eternal generation, spiration, inseparable operations, and taxis.
 - **Polemic aid** against social trinitarianism and against one-person-of-God formulations (Van Til critique).
 - **Exegetical model** for reading missions in John/Paul as windows into processions.
 - **Conceptual pivot** for integrating Trinity with Christology and Pneumatology in Reformed curricula.
