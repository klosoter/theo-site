### TITLE
**Essays in Reformed Dogmatics - Cornelius Van Til**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed academic milieu (Van Til at Westminster Theological Seminary; dialogue with Kuyperian, Bavinckian, neo-orthodox, and liberal currents).
 - Part apologetic, part dogmatic reflection: situates classic Reformed loci within a presuppositional epistemology and apologetic method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The dogmatic task must begin with the self-revelation of the triune God as the presupposition for all thought; this reshapes how Reformed theology treats covenant and confessional formulations.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Principle: Scripture and the confessions as correlative with an epistemic antithesis between Christian and non-Christian thought.
 - Moves:
 - Reassert biblical revelation as the ultimate norm and the only adequate presupposition for theology.
 - Show the impossibility of neutral rational ground: non-Christian systems are internally inconsistent when pressed by the Christian presupposition.
 - Reinterpret key Reformed categories (covenant, law/gospel, common/particular grace) with epistemological priority given to revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly: Kuyper and neo-Calvinists on cultural engagement; Bavinck on dogmatics; neo-orthodox critics; mainstream Protestant and Roman Catholic treatments of covenantal and confessional theology.
 - Frequently adduces Scripture, classic Reformed confessions, and analytic philosophical critique.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and epistemology (presuppositions), covenant theology (Covenant of Grace particularly), confessional formulations of covenant, law and gospel, Christology as center of dogmatics, common and special grace, antithesis and apologetics.
 - (Site reference: **Covenant Of Grace** - Van Til reframes covenantal continuity/ discontinuity through presuppositional lenses.)
 - (Site reference: **Confessional Formulations Of Covenant** - sustained critique and constructive reading of confessional language as theological rule under Scripture.)
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til's collection insists that faithful Reformed dogmatics requires theological epistemology: the triune God as presupposition orders covenantal doctrine and guards confessional fidelity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Elevates presuppositionalism from apologetic technique to normative dogmatic method: theology must first secure the mind by divine revelation.
 - Strong focus on the antithesis: no neutral intellectual common ground between Christian and non-Christian systems.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived compromises of Kuyperian common grace and some neo-Calvinist conciliations by stressing the priority of the Christian worldview over any claimed neutral culture or reason.
 - Challenges legalistic or pietistic reductions of covenant by insisting covenantal claims be read within a revelation-first epistemology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of epistemology and covenantal categories: covenantal relations are not merely juridical-past events but epistemic relations shaping all thought.
 - Recasts confessions as interpretive, mediating documents subordinate to Scripture but indispensable for stewarding the community's presuppositions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among later presuppositional apologists and some conservative Reformed theologians; contested by more ecumenical, Kuyperian, and neo-orthodox scholars.
 - Catalyzed renewed attention to how apologetics and dogmatics interrelate in covenantal theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces clarity about theological method: useful for seminarians and teachers who need to defend the theological primacy of revelation while engaging confessional tradition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - Epistemological doctrine that Christian revelation must be the baseline presupposition for coherent thinking.
- **Antithesis** - Radical spiritual and intellectual divide between Christian and non-Christian worldviews.
- **Covenant of Grace** - Read not merely juridically but as the epistemic-locus where God's self-revelation defines the believer's knowledge and life.
- **Confessional Formulations of Covenant** - Confessions as subordinate, clarifying expressions that embody communal presuppositions under Scripture.
- **Common grace** - Treated critically when invoked to justify neutral reason; affirmed only in a limited, confessed sense compatible with presuppositional priorities.
- **Law-Gospel distinction** - Reasserted with epistemic priority: law exposes unbelief; gospel presupposes Christ as the true interpretive key.
- **Transcendence and Immanence** - Stress on divine transcendence to counter naturalistic assimilation, balanced by Christ-centred immanence as epistemic access.
- **Revelation as epistemic norm** - Revelation governs not only ethical content but cognitive presuppositions.
- **Confessional fidelity** - The confessions function as community memory and rule, but always critiqued and corrected by Scripture as normative.
- **Nonfoundationalism (qualified)** - Rejects neutral first principles outside revelation; insists on revelation as grounding without reducing to circularity.
- **Analogy of Faith (rule of interpretation)** - Emphasized as a hermeneutical safeguard: Scripture interprets Scripture within the covenantal framework.
- **Polemic against natural theology** - Van Til rejects natural theology that presumes autonomous human reason as a theological starting place.
- **Christocentric dogmatics** - Christ is the center that unifies covenantal and epistemological claims.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional method applied to covenant theology and confessional interpretation.
 - As a **polemic** against neutralist or syncretistic readings of confessions and covenantal continuity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking apologetics, epistemology, and covenantal dogmatics; occasionally used as an exegetical heuristic for covenant passages in light of presuppositions.
