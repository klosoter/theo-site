### TITLE
**Karl Barth's Doctrine of Election (Bruce L. McCormack) - notes on Barth's treatment of Pactum Salutis and Christ as Covenant Head**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Barth scholarship; Bruce McCormack's sustained attempt to clarify and systematize Barth's thinking on election against both traditional Reformed formulations and critics who label Barth a universalist or a voluntarist.
 - Engages Barth's treatment across the Church Dogmatics with focus on Barth's Christocentric reconfiguration of classical Reformed election debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Barth relocates election from an abstract divine decree about individuals to the concrete, historical person of Jesus Christ: Christ is both the electing God and the elected man. McCormack argues this creates an internally coherent Barthian doctrine that presupposes a covenantal ordering (pactum salutis) and a distinctive Trinitarian logic.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Demonstrate how Barth moves from speculative, metaphysical predestination to election centered in the Son.
 - Show that Barth's account nonetheless presupposes a form of the pactum salutis (a covenant of redemption/Christ as covenant head), contrary to some interpretations that see Barth as rejecting the pactum.
 - Trace consequences: the interpenetration of Christology, soteriology, and Trinitarian theology; election as both universal in scope (in Christ) and particular in realization (in the elect).
 - Evaluate Barth's relation to classical double predestination and to Calvin's formulations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Karl Barth (primary subject); Bruce McCormack (interpreter).
 - Interacts with Calvin and Reformed orthodoxy, debates over the pactum salutis (classical Lutheran/Reformed polemics), modern interpreters who accuse Barth of universalism or incoherence.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election, covenant (pactum salutis), Christology (Christ as covenant head), Trinity (intra-Trinitarian grounding of election), soteriology, revelation (Christ as the locus of God's revelation and election).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Barth's doctrine of election is resolutely **Christocentric and Trinitarian**: election occurs in the incarnate Son as the decisive historical event in which God elects humanity to salvation, with the pactum salutis functioning as the covenantal logic that grounds Christ's representative headship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Elevates **Christ as both electing God and elected man**, making election essentially the event and person of Christ rather than a timeless decretal blueprint for individual fates.
 - Reframes election as **eschatologically and historically anchored** (in Christ's life, death, and resurrection) while preserving intratrinitarian intentionality.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves away from the abstract, decree-centered models of some classical Reformed schemas; criticizes any account that detaches election from revelation in Christ.
 - Yet McCormack argues Barth is closer to Reformation covenantal thinking (pactum salutis) than many commentators grant-Barth did not simply abolish the pactum but transformed its theological function.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The twin motif of **"electing God and elected man"** as the hermeneutical key.
 - The prioritization of **Christ-event over decretal timelessness** without lapsing into mere temporalism or universalism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Sparked renewed debate on whether Barth reintroduces a pactum salutis; influenced subsequent Barth scholarship that seeks to reconcile Barth with Reformed covenantalism.
 - Widely used in contemporary Reformed theology to defend a non-deterministic, Christ-centered doctrine of election.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how election can be both particular and universal without reducing it to deterministic decrees; valuable for teaching on Christology, covenant, and Reformed orthodox reception of Barth.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election** - In Barth, centered in the person and work of Jesus Christ; God's choosing is the choosing of Christ as the representative of humanity.
- **Electing God / Elected Man** - Barth's paradoxical formula: the Son is both subject (God electing) and object (the man elected) of election.
- **Pactum Salutis (covenant of redemption)** - McCormack argues Barth tacitly operates with a covenantal ordering: an intratrinitarian agreement corresponding to Christ's headship, though Barth reframes its theological role.
 - Relation: Not a scholastic speculative decree but the covenantal logic that grounds Christ's representative mission.
- **Christocentric election** - Election understood only in and through Christ; all talk of human election must be mediated by Christology.
- **Trinitarian grounding** - Election rooted in the perichoretic life of the Triune God; the Father elects in the Son through the Spirit.
- **Representative head / covenant headship** - Christ as corporate representative of humanity; his person constitutes the locus where election is applied.
- **Particularity vs. universality** - Barth: election is universal in scope (applies to humanity in Christ) but particular in application (actual salvation is realized in the elect).
- **Historicized election (eventalized)** - Election is not merely an abstract decree but an event centered in the Christ-historical reality.
- **Anti-natural theology** - Barth's rejection of natural theology shapes his doctrine: election is known only by revelation in Christ.
- **Reprobation (contrast)** - Barth rejects classical symmetrical double predestination as typically construed; reprobation is reframed in relation to Christ's universal claim and particular appropriation.
- **Order of decrees (contrast)** - Barth avoids scholastic "order of decrees" speculation; McCormack reads him as renewing a covenantal logic instead.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: used as the modern Barthian exemplar for a **Christocentric definition of election**.
 - Polemic: employed against both deterministic double predestination and naive universalism.
 - Exegetical model: serves as a framework for reading Romans 9 and Johannine election motifs through a Christ-centered, covenant-head lens.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in systematics to bridge Christology, Trinity, and soteriology around the pactum salutis motif.
