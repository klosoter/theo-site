### TITLE
Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts - Craig S. Keener (Baker Academic, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2011 amid renewed scholarly and ecclesial debate over miracles, charismatic renewal, and historical-critical methods.
 - Moves against dominant skeptical readings shaped by Humean philosophy and methodological naturalism; engages both academic skeptics and evangelical believers.
- **Central thesis**
 - The New Testament miracle reports are historically credible: when assessed by historical standards and abundant comparative evidence, the probability that the NT authors recorded real events is high.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Assembles a massive, cross-cultural database of miracle reports from antiquity to modern times to show that miracle claims are not unique or improbable.
 - Argues for a cumulative-case, probabilistic method familiar to historical reasoning rather than strict a priori exclusion of miracles.
 - Reconstructs NT contexts (Jewish, Greco-Roman, early Christian) to explain how eyewitness testimony, early proclamation, and corroborative reports support credibility.
 - Applies results to apologetics and ecclesial practice: biblical miracles validate Jesus' identity and ongoing Spirit-empowered ministry.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages philosophical skeptics (David Hume implicitly and explicitly), modern critical scholars who downplay miracle reports, and historians of antiquity.
 - Uses a wide array of primary sources: Jewish and Greco-Roman historians, early Christian writings, patristic material, and ethnographic reports of modern miracle claims.
 - Interacts with contemporary debates: **Continuationism vs Cessationism**, Pentecostal scholarship, and Reformed critiques (see "Pentecostalism And Reformed Response").
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central): role of the Spirit in signs, healing, and prophecy across redemptive history.
 - **Christology** and soteriology: miracles as credentials for Jesus' messianic identity and atonement implications.
 - **Revelation / authority**: how historical miracle claims bear on the trustworthiness of the NT.
 - **Ecclesiology**: role of signs/wonders in the life of the believing community.
- **Closing line**
 - Keener's scholarly center of gravity: empirical-historical defense that locates miracles as credible, normative indicators of God's active work in the New Testament and beyond.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Extraordinary breadth of comparative data: Keener marshals ancient and modern testimonies to normalize miracle-reporting as a human phenomenon.
 - Methodological pluralism: favors probabilistic historical judgment over philosophical a priori exclusions of miracles.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to Humean dismissal: Keener demonstrates Hume's assumptions about uniform experience and improbability are historically contingent and overstated.
 - Contrasts with skeptical-critical scholars who reduce miracle narratives to myth or legend by appealing to early eyewitness coherence and social contexts for reporting.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "credibility" in measurable historical-probabilistic terms rather than purely metaphysical possibility; appeals to cumulative corroboration.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used by continuationists and Pentecostal scholars as a major scholarly resource supporting ongoing miraculous gifts.
 - Influenced some conservative Reformed theologians to reconsider historical warrants for miracles; others accept Keener's historical data but maintain theological restraint (cessationist concerns over normative continuation).
 - Cited in debates titled **Pentecostalism And Reformed Response** and in studies of **The Spirit In Redemptive History** for its detailed pneumatological evidence.
- **Enduring value**
 - A standard reference for historical-apologetic defense of miracles; valuable for pastors, parish educators, and scholars in pneumatology and redemptive-historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism**
 - Keener's work is a core academic resource used to argue that NT gifts plausibly continue given historical patterns and contemporary analogues.
- **Cessationism**
 - Opponents use Keener's data selectively but often dispute theological-normative conclusions; work reframes their burden of proof.
- **Probabilistic reasoning**
 - Methodological thrust: historical probability and cumulative case replace strict philosophical impossibility.
- **Humean critique / Humeanism**
 - Keener refutes the philosophical dismissal of miracles by exposing historical and evidential weaknesses in Hume's premises.
- **Eyewitness testimony**
 - Emphasized as crucial: early testimony, memory dynamics, and communal corroboration increase historical credibility.
- **Ancient and extra-biblical miracle reports**
 - Comparative corpus used to show frequency and social plausibility of miracle claims in antiquity.
- **Pneumatology (The Spirit in Redemptive History)**
 - Treats miracles as integral to the Spirit's work across redemptive history rather than isolated phenomena.
- **Signs and wonders**
 - Functional category: credentials for divine action, evangelistic and pastoral utility.
- **Empirical-historical apologetics**
 - Describes the mode of Keener's defense-data-driven, cross-cultural, historically informed.
- **Redemptive-historical continuity**
 - Keener links OT, NT, and post-apostolic signs to argue for continuity in Spirit-activity.
- **Sensus communis (common human reporting)**
 - Used implicitly: wide human readiness to report extraordinary events supports plausibility.
- **Exegetical model**
 - Keener's careful attention to context provides a model for scriptural exegesis that integrates historical data and theological interpretation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition and data source** for proponents of Continuationism in debates over gifts and miracles.
 - As a **polemic and resource** in the conversation "Pentecostalism And Reformed Response," supplying evidence both sides must address.
 - As an **exegetical and theological model** in studies of **The Spirit In Redemptive History**, informing pneumatological and redemptive-historical arguments.
