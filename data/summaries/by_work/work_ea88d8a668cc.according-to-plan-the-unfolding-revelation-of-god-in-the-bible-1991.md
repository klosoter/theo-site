### TITLE
According to Plan: The Unfolding Revelation of God in the Bible (1991) - Graeme Goldsworthy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Published 1991 amid late-20th-century evangelical recovery of biblical theology and a growing "redemptive-historical" emphasis in preaching and seminary curricula. Responds to fragmentation from historical-critical methods and popular dispensational readings.
- **Central thesis:** The Bible is a single, coherent, progressively unfolding divine plan centered on the person and work of Christ; biblical theology is the discipline of tracing that promise-fulfillment plan so that both Testaments are read Christocentrically without eisegesis.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Scripture is organized around **promise and fulfillment**: God's promises (primarily covenantal) in the OT are progressively revealed and find covenantal and redemptive consummation in Christ.
 - The proper hermeneutic is **canonical and redemptive-historical**: read OT promises in their historical context while discerning their telos in Christ.
 - **Typology** is defended as a legitimate, historically grounded method for showing how persons, institutions, and events point forward to Christ.
 - The Bible's major motifs (kingdom, covenant, sacrifice, temple, law, promise) form a coherent interpretive grid that informs preaching and theology.
- **Figures/sources/interlocutors engaged:** Draws on and interacts with the Reformed/covenantal tradition and the evangelical biblical-theology movement; argues against dispensational and fragmentary readings more than engaging single authors in polemical detail.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (and covenants as structural categories), Christology (fulfillment and typology), kingdom of God, atonement (promise/fulfillment), hermeneutics and canonical unity.
- **Closing line:** Goldsworthy's theological center of gravity: the Bible must be read as one unfolding divine plan whose telos is Christ - biblical theology is the discipline that shows how promise becomes fulfillment in him.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Gospel-shaped hermeneutic:** Insists that Christ and the gospel are the controlling center for reading all Scripture, including the Old Testament, while preserving historical integrity.
- **Covenant/plan as organizing principle:** Uses covenant theology and a promise-fulfillment schema as the primary structural categories rather than purely chronological or dispensational divisions.
- **Typology robustly defended:** Presents typology as historically anchored and theologically legitimate, not merely allegory - types are real historical foreshadowings whose meaning is fulfilled in Christ.
- **Balance of historical and canonical concerns:** Refuses both wholesale historical-critical reduction of redemptive meaning and ahistorical spiritualizing; promotes a disciplined canonical reading that traces theological development.
- **Corrections/contrasts:** Counters dispensational separations of OT promises from NT fulfillment and opposes approaches that treat OT material as peripheral to the gospel.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly influential among evangelicals and in Reformed circles; shaped preaching curricula, seminary biblical-theology courses, and the redemptive-historical movement; served as a readable primer for pastors and students alike.
- **Enduring value:** Clear, pastoral, and systematic presentation of a Christocentric hermeneutic; durable as both an introduction to biblical theology and as a practical guide for gospel-centered preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plan:** God's single, unfolding purpose across Scripture; the organizing metaphor of the book.
- **Promise-fulfillment:** Core dynamic - divine promises in the OT find their fulfillment in Christ and the new covenant.
- **Covenant:** Structural category for biblical history; covenants as the framework for progressive revelation.
 - Relation: Covenants articulate the plan's stages (creation, fall, promise, law, kingdom, consummation).
- **Christocentric reading:** Method that makes Christ the interpretive center of Scripture without collapsing historical meaning.
- **Typology:** Theological-historical foreshadowing where persons/events/institutions prefigure Christ and his work.
- **Redemptive-historical:** Approach focusing on God's acts and their saving significance through time rather than primarily on ethical or cultic laws.
- **Kingdom:** Central motif linking OT promises and NT fulfillment; Jesus is the kingdom's center and inaugurator.
- **Canonical hermeneutic:** Reading texts within the unity of the canon - attends to both historical context and canonical telos.
- **Law and gospel:** Interpreted relationally within the promise/fulfillment framework rather than as separate systems.
- **Fulfillment:** Theologically loaded term indicating completion and consummation of earlier promises in Christ.
- **Unity of Scripture:** The claim that Scripture coheres theologically around God's redemptive aim in Christ.
- **Historical-grammatical fidelity:** Maintains textual and historical sense while discerning theological trajectory.
- **Preaching application:** Emphasizes gospel-shaped exposition across both Testaments.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical biblical theology and redemptive-historical method.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational fragmentation and non-Christocentric readings of the OT.
- As an **exegetical and homiletical model** for gospel-centered preaching that ties individual texts to the wider promise-fulfillment narrative.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary curricula to reorganize systematic and pastoral theology around covenantal plan and Christ's fulfillment.
