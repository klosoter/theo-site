### TITLE
The Miraculous Gifts: Are They for Today? (essays by Vern Poythress)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed engagement with the charismatic movement; addresses debates within conservative evangelicalism over continuity of New Testament sign-miracles.
 - Poythress writes from a Reformed, confessional perspective with philosophical-theological training (ThM/PhD background), bringing analytic precision to pastoral-ecclesial questions.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central concern: what is the proper status of the New Testament "miraculous" gifts (prophecy, tongues, healings, apostleship, revelatory prophecy) in the post-apostolic church?
 - Poythress defends a careful, Scripture-governed approach that recognizes the historical function of sign gifts while insisting on the priority of canonical revelation and rigorous criteria for modern claims.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of 1 Corinthians 12-14, Ephesians 4:7-16, 2 Corinthians 12, and Acts as loci classicus for understanding gift-terminology and purpose.
 - Historical-theological survey: outlines early church patterns, Reformation reactions, and modern charismatic/cessationist positions.
 - Theological-epistemological analysis:
 - Distinguishes *foundational* (apostolic, revelatory) gifts from *edifying* or continuing gifts.
 - Argues sign gifts had an authentication role tied to apostolic revelation and the establishment of the canon.
 - Affirms God's sovereign ability to work miracles but sets normative tests (canon, ecclesial order, fruit, doctrinal conformity) for contemporary claims.
 - Methodological move: integrates hermeneutics, ecclesiology, and philosophy of knowledge to produce criteria for evaluating purported gifts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary continuationists (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Gordon Fee) and classical cessationists (e.g., B. B. Warfield, John MacArthur), as well as primary New Testament texts and patristic / Reformation treatments.
 - Uses analytic philosophy of language and epistemology to sharpen theological distinctions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and its closure; Scripture as normative rule.
 - Pneumatology (nature, gifts, and operations of the Spirit).
 - Ecclesiology (authority, order, apostolicity).
 - Christology indirectly (miracles as attestations to Christ and the gospel).
 - Soteriology and sanctification insofar as gift-use affects pastoral life.

- **Closing line**
 - A balanced, Scripture-centered assessment that locates the chief theological gravity in the canon and apostolic foundation while providing disciplined criteria to judge modern claims to miraculous gifts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong epistemological framing: gifts assessed by their function in establishing and authenticating revelation rather than merely by experiential verification.
 - Persistent attention to the *canonical* and *foundational* character of apostolic gifts.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects uncritical charismatic practice by insisting on doctrinal and canonical checks; rejects naive equating of all extraordinary phenomena with normative ecclesial gifts.
 - Corrections to rigid cessationism: acknowledges that God can and does act miraculously, and that some non-foundational charisms may continue historically.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clear distinction between *foundational/revelatory* gifts (tied to apostolicity and canon) and *edifying/ordinary* gifts (ongoing in church life).
 - Use of analytic categories (authentication, epistemic warrant) applied to pneumatological claims.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed academic circles as a sober, philosophically informed critique of both extremes.
 - Used by pastors and seminary instructors as a model for disciplined theological engagement with charismatic phenomena.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological exemplar: integrates exegesis, church history, and epistemology.
 - Useful for teaching on Scripture's authority, the nature of revelation, and pastoral discernment in charismatic contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism**
 - The view that certain miraculous/revelatory gifts ceased with the apostolic era; Poythress nuances rather than fully closes the door to miraculous acts.
- **Continuationism**
 - The claim that all New Testament gifts continue; Poythress engages this but insists on tests and canonical primacy.
- **Sign gifts**
 - Gifts serving as signs (miracles, healings, tongues) whose primary biblical function is authentication of revelation and messengers.
- **Foundational gifts**
 - Gifts tied to apostolic foundation and the formation of the canon; decisive for early church authority.
- **Edifying gifts**
 - Charisms primarily for building up the church (teaching, exhortation) which have normative ongoing function.
- **Canonical normativity**
 - The doctrine that Scripture's completed canon governs doctrinal and charismatic claims; used by Poythress as the final criterion.
- **Authentication / epistemic warrant**
 - The standard Poythress uses to test miraculous claims: do they authenticate revelation and align with canonical truth?
- **Apostolicity**
 - Linked to foundational gifts; apostolic office served as locus for revelatory authority in the early church.
- **Prophetic authority (New Testament)**
 - Distinguished between revelatory prophecy (foundation) and normative prophetic speech (subordinate to Scripture).
- **Extraordinary vs ordinary operations**
 - Categories for distinguishing rare, foundational acts from regular Spirit-work in sanctification and ministry.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic**
 - Contextualizes gifts within the unfolding of revelation and covenant history.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Study of the Spirit's work; Poythress stresses both sovereignty and rule-governed discernment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a polemical resource against uncritical charismatic excesses, supplying a disciplined theological critique.
 - As an exegetical and methodological model for assessing claims to gifts-bridging Scripture, church history, and epistemology.
 - As a conceptual pivot in courses on pneumatology and the doctrine of revelation-especially where authority and experience intersect.
