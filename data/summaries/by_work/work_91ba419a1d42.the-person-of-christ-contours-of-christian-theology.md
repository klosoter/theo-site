### TITLE
The Person of Christ (Contours of Christian Theology) 
Author: Unknown - pedagogical/introductory monograph in a contemporary theological series. 
Associated tradition: broadly Protestant/Reformed-academic orientation with ecumenical engagement.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-academic milieu (late 20th-21st century); aimed at seminaries and advanced church study. Intends to restate classical Christology for doctrine, preaching, and pastoral care amid modern challenges (liberal reductionism, kenotic readings, and functionalist Christologies).
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** To vindicate the historic claim that Jesus is the one eternal Son of God who truly became man - fully God and fully human in one hypostasis - and to show how that truth grounds atonement, mediation, and worship.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: New Testament christological data (Gospels, Paul, John) establishing both deity and true humanity.
 - Historical retrieval: patristic and conciliar formulations (esp. Chalcedon) as normative loci for synthesis.
 - Theological anatomy: careful distinction of two natures (physis) in one person (hypostasis) and articulation of how predicates cross (communicatio idiomatum).
 - Doctrinal application: incarnation and eternal sonship clarified; implications for atonement, intercession, and sacraments.
 - Polemical moves: rebuttal of Nestorian separations, Eutychian fusion, and modern kenotic or merely-functional Christologies.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Patristic authors (Cyril, Athanasius), Chalcedonian formulary, Augustine, medieval scholastics, Reformers (Luther & Calvin), and representative modern critics (kenotic theologians, liberal reductionists).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (central), Trinity (as background frame), incarnation, eternal Sonship, communicatio idiomatum, atonement, soteriology, revelation, and pastoral-sacramental consequences.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The identity of Christ as the eternally begotten Son who assumes human nature without relinquishing deity is the decisive hinge for orthodox theology, safeguarding both redemption and true worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Reasserts **eternal sonship** as prior to and constitutive of the incarnation (not merely a function of the earthly ministry).
 - Treats **communicatio idiomatum** not as a loose shorthand but as a disciplined, propositional account of how properties are ascribed without confusion of natures.
- **Corrections/contrasts:**
 - Corrects modern kenotic readings by insisting that divine self-emptying is effectual in the economy but does not entail loss of divine attributes.
 - Opposes Nestorian bifurcation by defending a personal unity that permits genuine human experiences (suffering, growth) to be ascribed to the one Son.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies language around "appropriation" vs. "communication" of properties; recommends terminological precision to avoid modalist or dualistic readings.
 - Proposes an analytic grid for predication across natures (directional predicates; occasioned vs. essential ascriptions).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries as a concise corrective to reductionist Christologies.
 - Valued ecumenically for clarity in teaching Chalcedonian commitments while engaging modern exegetical questions.
- **Enduring value:** Pedagogical clarity in synthesizing patristic orthodoxy with contemporary concerns; a reliable bridge between academic Christology and pulpit/sacramental application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** The personal union of two distinct natures (divine and human) in the one hypostasis (Person) of the Son.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** The norm for orthodox Christology: two natures "without confusion, change, division, or separation."
- **Eternal Sonship:** The Son's relationship to the Father that is prior to time and the incarnation; grounds the identity of the incarnate Christ.
 - Contrasted with "adoptive" or merely economic sonship readings.
- **Incarnation:** The eternal Son's assuming of a complete human nature (without sin) in the historical person of Jesus of Nazareth.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** The doctrine that properties of both natures are truly ascribed to the one person of Christ.
 - Treatment emphasizes disciplined predicate rules to avoid category mistakes.
- **Kenosis:** The concept of divine self-emptying (Philippians 2); here rejected if read as ontological loss of deity.
- **Two Natures, One Person:** Core formula for avoiding both Nestorian division and Eutychian fusion.
- **Appropriation vs. Communication:** Distinction between rightful application of soteriological acts to one nature and genuine communication of predicates to the person.
- **Impassibility/Passibility:** Discussion of whether and how the divine Son experiences human passibility without undermining divine immutability.
- **Ontological vs. Economic Trinity:** Differentiates immanent relations from redemptive-historical roles in Christ's person.
- **Mediator:** Christ as the single subject bridging God and humanity; warrants doctrinal claims about representation and sacrifice.
- **Soteriological implications:** How the union secures substitution, satisfaction, and redemption - human suffering credited to the divine Son.
- **Exegetical model:** The book supplies a model of reading christological texts that combines grammatical-historical exegesis with doctrinal categories.
- **Polemic tool:** Often deployed against modern kenoticism, functionalism, and any anthropology that diminishes true human experience in Christ.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for teaching Chalcedonian Christology and eternal sonship.
- As a **polemic** resource to rebut kenotic, Nestorian, or purely functional Christologies.
- As an **exegetical model** for ascribing biblical predicates to the Son while maintaining ontological distinctions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching/sacramental theology to link Christ's person to atoning action.
