### TITLE
The Covenant of Works in Reformed Theology (WTJ 28:1, 1965) - Anthony A. Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholarship; presuppositional and historical interest in classical federal theology.
 - Written amid renewed debates about covenantal categories and their biblical warrant; speaks to seminarians and scholars re-evaluating Westminster and post-Reformation formulations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Hoekema surveys the historical development and theological justification of the **covenant of works** and argues that, properly defined, the covenantal scheme (works/covenant of grace) remains a theologically useful and biblically defensible framework-provided key clarifications correct common misunderstandings and abuses.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey: traces formulations from Reformation writers through the Westminster standards and later orthodox Reformed theologians.
 - Biblical-theological assessment: examines Genesis and Pauline texts on Adam, law, and promise to locate the covenantal idea in Scripture.
 - Theological analysis:
 - Defines the covenant of works as a **prelapsarian, conditional covenant** between God and Adam in which life is promised on condition of perfect obedience.
 - Emphasizes **federal headship**-Adam as representative whose failure has corporate consequences.
 - Connects covenant of works to covenant of grace through **typology**: Christ as the obedient "second Adam" fulfilling the conditions Adam failed to meet.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal cautions: warns against legalistic or meritocratic readings that make salvation final contingent on human merit rather than divine grace enacted in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, the Westminster divines, Reformed orthodox theologians).
 - Nineteenth- and twentieth-century interpreters and critics of federal theology.
 - Implicitly engages rival models: single-covenant approaches, some Roman Catholic and liberal critiques, and emerging modern theological challenges.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works and grace), anthropology (original righteousness, sin), soteriology (imputation, justification; Christ as second Adam), law and gospel, typology and promise.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Hoekema locates the article's theological center of gravity in a historically-informed and biblically-grounded defense of the covenant of works as an essential analytic category for understanding Adamic representation and Christ's federal obedience-tempered by warnings against merit-oriented distortions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful distinction between *promise-as-reward* language and *merit*; frames the covenant as conditional probation under God's sovereign administration rather than a bilateral bargain of equal parties.
 - Strong historical sensitivity: attempts to reconstruct how the doctrine functioned pastorally and systematically in Reformed confessions.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Counters simplistic caricatures (e.g., that the covenant of works makes God a creditor) by stressing divine initiation and gratuitousness of covenantal ordering.
 - Pushes back on single-covenant or purely redemptive-only readings that erase prelapsarian legal conditions and representative arrangements.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies key terms (reward vs. promise; condition vs. merit) to defuse common polemical misunderstandings.
 - Employs typological hermeneutic consistently to link Adamic failure and Christic fulfillment without collapsing the distinct administrations of covenant.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Frequently cited in mid-to-late 20th century Reformed debates as a balanced, historically-informed defense of classic federal categories.
 - Influential in seminary instruction and later systematic treatments of covenant theology; often invoked in contemporary debates over the relevance and shape of the covenant of works.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a compact, scholarly corrective to both caricature and dismissal; valuable for teaching the interrelation of Adam-Christ typology, imputation, and covenantal structure.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - Prelapsarian covenant between God and Adam promising life for perfect obedience; central subject of the article.
- **Covenant of Grace** - Postlapsarian covenant of redemption/ grace fulfilled in Christ; related to but distinct from the covenant of works.
- **Federal Headship (Representation)** - Adam as representative whose act affects all his posterity; the doctrine anchors corporate sin and imputation.
- **Imputation** - The forensic transfer of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness; discussed as theological consequence of federal headship.
- **Promise vs. Reward** - Hoekema distinguishes the covenantal promise of life as God's pledge, not a utilitarian wage.
- **Probationary Condition** - The covenant of works as a test of obedience; the legal condition under which life was promised.
- **Typology (Adam-Christ)** - Christ as the "second Adam" who succeeds where the first failed; central hermeneutic link between the two covenants.
- **Prelapsarian / Postlapsarian** - Temporal-covenantal categories used to locate the covenant of works and its relation to sin.
- **Merit (theological caution)** - Clarifies that covenantal language must not be read as endorsing human earning of salvation.
- **Law and Gospel** - Covenant of works represents law-demand; covenant of grace manifests gospel provision through Christ.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - Related intra-Trinitarian agreement often discussed in federal schemas and distinguished from the covenant of works.
- **Representative Obligation** - The nature of Adam's duty as legal and communal, not merely individualistic.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** - Clear, concise statement of what proponents mean by "covenant of works."
 - **Polemic resource** - Employed to rebut both reductionist single-covenant models and merit-based interpretations.
 - **Exegetical-typological model** - Serves as a compact hermeneutical template linking Genesis, Pauline theology, and Christology in systematic treatments.
