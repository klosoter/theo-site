### TITLE
**The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: The Significance of the Cappadocian Contribution** - John D. Zizioulas (in Trinitarian Theology Today)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Anglican/Patristic renewal in ecumenical conversation; engagement with Orthodox patristics as corrective to modern Western ontology.
 - Zizioulas writes as an Orthodox theologian and patristic scholar addressing contemporary Trinitarian debates and ecumenical obstacles (notably the Filioque and Western metaphysics).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Cappadocians reoriented Trinitarian doctrine by making **personhood (hypostasis) the primary category** for understanding God; this relational ontology corrects both modalism and impersonal substance metaphysics.
 - This Cappadocian contribution has decisive implications for the ontological vs economic Trinity and for ecumenical disputes like the Filioque.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Cappadocian texts (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen) demonstrating their operational move from ousia-language to hypostatic/personal language.
 - Defense of a **relational ontology**: persons are constituted by relations; divine being is communion rather than static substance.
 - Application to two contemporary loci:
 - **Ontological vs Economic Trinity**: the apparent dichotomy is dissolved when persons (hypostases) are ontologically primary; the economic actions reveal the persons without reducing them to roles.
 - **Filioque and Ecumenical Creeds**: Cappadocians' insistence on the monarchy of the Father and specific language of procession shapes a patristic model that resists the Filioque as a unilateral theological innovation.
 - Concludes by arguing that Cappadocian personhood grounds ecclesiology and sacramental participation: human personhood is realized in communion modeled on the Trinity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen.
 - Secondary interlocutors: Athanasius, later Eastern Orthodox reception, Western Scholastic categories; modern theologians engaged in social Trinity debates.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), personhood/hypostasis, being (ousia), procession of the Spirit, economy of salvation, ecclesiology, sacramental ontology.

- **Closing line**
 - The Cappadocians make the Trinity intelligible as a **dynamic communion of persons**, and this relational ontology is the keystone for a Trinitarian praxis in theology and ecumenical theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves from substance-based ontology to a **relational, person-centered ontology**: being is communion.
 - Strong linkage of Trinitarian theology to ecclesiology and sacramental life: the church participates in the Trinitarian life.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects perceived Western overemphasis on ousia (substance) and static metaphysics that obscure personal distinctions.
 - Opposes both modalism (denial of real distinctions of persons) and rationalist subordinationism (reducing persons to properties of one substance).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reassertion and refinement of **hypostasis** as the primary ontological term.
 - Use of relational predicates to define personhood rather than individualist or substantialist predicates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in contemporary Orthodox theology and ecumenical Trinitarian studies.
 - Adopted, critiqued, and debated across Reformed and Western theology: praised for revitalizing relational readings; critiqued by those defending Western metaphysical clarity and by some analytic theologians wary of vague relationalism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as indispensable corrective and resource for:
 - Reframing debates on ontological vs economic Trinity.
 - Reassessing the Filioque controversy with renewed attention to patristic language.
 - Forming a Trinitarian basis for ecclesiology and Christian anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostasis**
 - Personhood in patristic usage; for Zizioulas, the primary category for divine being and human personhood.

- **Ousia**
 - Substance/essence; backgrounded by Cappadocians in favor of hypostasis, but still affirmed as common divine being.

- **Relational ontology / being as communion**
 - The thesis that existence is constituted by relations; divine being is interpersonal communion.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of the persons; used to describe the dynamic interpenetration without confusion.

- **Monarchy of the Father**
 - The Father's role as principle within the Trinity; Zizioulas uses Cappadocians to reaffirm a relational monarchy that resists unilateral doctrinal changes.

- **Procession / Ekporeusis**
 - Technical term for the Spirit's origin "from the Father"; central to the Filioque debate and patristic precision.

- **Ontological Trinity**
 - The inner life and being of God; Zizioulas argues it must be read through hypostatic/personal categories, not abstract substance.

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's actions in history; connected to persons as revealed agents rather than merely functional modes.

- **Person (prosopon)**
 - Face/presence in relation; human personhood participates in Trinitarian personhood through communion.

- **Communio personarum**
 - Communion of persons; the sociological image of the Trinity used to ground ecclesiology.

- **Cappadocians**
 - Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen - primary sources for Zizioulas' thesis.

- **Filioque**
 - Clause "and the Son" in the Western Creed; Zizioulas invokes Cappadocians to critique its unilateral insertion.

- **Social/Relational Trinity**
 - Contemporary appropriation of Cappadocian insights; Zizioulas is a major proponent, though with careful patristic anchoring.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source**: authoritative patristic grounding for hypostasis-centered Trinitarian ontology.
- **Polemic / ecumenical tool**: deployed against Filioque arguments and Western substance-first readings.
- **Exegetical model**: exemplar of reading patristic texts to reshape contemporary theological categories and to connect Trinity to ecclesiology.
