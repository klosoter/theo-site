### TITLE
**The Doctrine of the Saints Perseverance Explained and Confirmed** (1654) - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Interregnum England; Independent Puritan milieu; post-Dort consolidation of Reformed soteriology.
 - Written chiefly against John Goodwin (Arminian) and in view of Socinian critiques; aims to steady congregations amid defection and controversy.
- **Central thesis**
 - **All truly regenerate saints infallibly persevere to final salvation** by the immutable grace of the Triune God, grounded in election, the new covenant, Christ's priesthood, and the Spirit's indwelling, with biblical warnings serving as ordained means to that end.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Refutation of Goodwin's conditional perseverance: exposes the instability of making grace depend on autonomous will.
 - Positive demonstration:
 - **Election and immutability of God** secure perseverance (Num 23:19; Rom 8).
 - **Covenant of grace** as unconditional, effectual, and better than the old; new-covenant promises cause perseverance (Jer 31-32; Heb 8-10).
 - **Christ's obedience, satisfaction, and intercession** infallibly preserve the redeemed (John 10; Heb 7:25).
 - **The Holy Spirit's person and sealing** as earnest and bond of future inheritance (Eph 1:13-14; 4:30).
 - **Nature of true faith and regeneration**: a divinely implanted habit that cannot utterly fail (1 Pet 1:5; 1 John 3:9).
 - Exegesis of apostasy texts: distinguishes **temporary faith** and mere profession (1 John 2:19) from true, persevering faith; warnings as instruments, not defeaters, of perseverance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opposes John Goodwin; interacts with Remonstrant and Socinian arguments.
 - Draws from Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodox causal analysis, and scholastic distinctions (efficient/meritorious/instrumental causes).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Soteriology**: election, calling, regeneration, faith, adoption, assurance, perseverance.
 - **Covenant theology**: covenant of works vs covenant of grace; Mosaic covenant's relation; new-covenant efficacy.
 - **Pneumatology**: deity and personhood of the Spirit; sealing, indwelling, earnest.
 - **Doctrine of sin**: original sin, total depravity and inability; the will's bondage.
 - **Theology proper**: divine immutability, faithfulness, wisdom.
- **Key proof texts (10)**
 - John 10:27-29; Rom 8:28-39; Jer 32:38-41; Heb 7:25; Eph 1:13-14; 1 Pet 1:5; Phil 1:6; Jude 24-25; 2 Tim 2:19; 1 John 2:19.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **Perseverance is a Trinitarian work within the inviolable new covenant, assuring the church without nullifying the necessity of means.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Trinitarian causality: Father's decree, Son's merit and intercession, Spirit's sealing as jointly securing perseverance.
 - **New-covenant efficacy**: God causes perseverance, not merely offers it.
 - Detailed causal account of perseverance (efficient, meritorious, instrumental, final causes).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Arminian conditionalism: denies that grace is finally contingent on autonomous will.
 - Clarifies **Mosaic covenant** as subservient/typological administration, not a reversion to a **covenant of works** as to substance.
 - Distinguishes assurance grounded in Christ from presumption; warnings function as means God uses to keep the elect.
- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Uses habits of grace vs acts of grace; temporary faith vs saving faith.
 - Sealing and earnest of the Spirit as legal-eschatological metaphors securing inheritance.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard Reformed defense of perseverance; informs later Congregationalist and Particular Baptist theology (e.g., Edwards, Gill, Spurgeon).
 - Critiqued by Wesleyans; appreciated in modern discussions of assurance and apostasy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of **exegesis wedded to scholastic clarity**, integrating covenant theology, Christ's priesthood, and pneumatology for pastoral stability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Assurance and perseverance**: God's preservation grounds believers' persevering; assurance flows from promises, not introspection alone.
- **Election**: immutable choice of God securing calling, faith, and perseverance.
- **Covenant of grace**: unbreakable in its efficacy; new-covenant promises cause obedience and perseverance.
- **Covenant of works**: law-based probation with Adam; contrasted with grace in substance.
- **Mosaic covenant (and works-as-to-substance debates)**: typological, pedagogical; does not overturn grace, though it republishes law in a subordinate sense.
- **Nature and origin of sin**: original corruption and **total depravity and total inability** necessitate effectual grace.
- **Regeneration and effectual calling**: Spirit implants a new principle of life; the regenerate are kept by God's power through faith.
- **Adoption**: filial status secured; Fatherly discipline preserves, not imperils, sonship.
- **Person and deity of the Holy Spirit**: the Spirit as divine sealer and earnest guarantees the inheritance.
- **Christ's intercession**: continual priestly advocacy ensures the non-failure of faith.
- **Divine immutability and faithfulness**: God's promises and oath anchor perseverance.
- **Temporary faith**: non-saving operations that can fail; explains visible apostasy without denying perseverance.
- **Means of grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer as ordained instruments by which God keeps the saints.
- **Warnings and threats**: real means to prevent apostasy; compatible with infallible perseverance.

- **How the work is used**
 - As a Reformed definition-source and polemic for perseverance across soteriology and assurance.
 - As an exegetical model on John 10, Rom 8, Jer 31-32, Heb 7 regarding covenant and priesthood.
 - As a conceptual pivot in covenant theology (works vs grace; Mosaic administration).
 - As pneumatological grounding for sealing and sanctification in pastoral theology.
