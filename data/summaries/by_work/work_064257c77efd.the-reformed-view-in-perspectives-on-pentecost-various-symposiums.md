### TITLE
**"The Reformed View" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Perspectives on Pentecost (symposium contribution)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical symposium literature addressing the charismatic renewal and Pentecostal claims. Ferguson writes from within conservative Reformed Protestantism, seeking to mediate pastoral concern, confessional fidelity, and engagement with charismatic phenomena.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Theologically reorder contemporary talk of the Baptism of the Holy Spirit so that it coheres with Reformed doctrine of union with Christ, covenant theology, and the ordinary means of grace-while neither ignoring the reality of Spirit-given power nor endorsing an extra-normative crisis mysticism.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Distinguishes **baptism with the Spirit** (ontological, unitary, granted in conversion and union with Christ) from subsequent experiences of empowerment or filling. 
 - Affirms that the Spirit's primary end is **union with Christ** (regeneration, adoption, incorporation into the covenant community) and not a detachable sign event (e.g., tongues) as normative proof. 
 - Treats charismatic gifts as real possibilities within Scripture's scope but subordinate to the Spirit's unitive and sanctifying work; warns against locating Christian authenticity in secondary phenomena. 
 - Argues for a sacramental/means-of-grace perspective: the Spirit works ordinarily through Word and sacrament to effect the baptismal reality. 
 - Offers pastoral safeguards: accountability, testing of experiences by Scripture, and ecclesial discernment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit and explicit contrasts with classical Pentecostal and some charismatic claims (experience as normative proof). 
 - Appeals to Reformed confessions (e.g., Westminster standards), Scripture (esp. Pauline theology of Spirit and union), and pastoral theology resources. 
 - Dialogues with contemporary evangelical voices who emphasize Spirit-empowerment as separate initiation.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Pneumatology (baptism with the Spirit, filling, gifts) 
 - Soteriology (regeneration, union with Christ) 
 - Ecclesiology (body of Christ, sacraments as means) 
 - Hermeneutics (testing spiritual experiences by Scripture)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 The Spirit's baptism is primarily the theological reality of union with Christ effected in conversion and nurtured by Word and sacrament; experiences of empowerment must be tested and fitted into that covenantal, Christocentric frame.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence that **Spirit-baptism is not a subsequent, necessary crisis** to conversion but the very gift that incorporates a person into Christ. 
 - Recovery of a **means-of-grace** reading of Pentecost: the extraordinary event at Jerusalem is paradigmatic for mission and giftedness but not prescriptive for normative ecclesial order.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against charismatic frameworks that equate Spirit-baptism with glossolalia or instant empowerment as the definitive mark of fullness. 
 - Corrects pietistic/Keswick tendencies that split regeneration from sanctification by reasserting their organic unity within union with Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clear terminological triage: **baptism with the Spirit (unional)** vs **filling of the Spirit (empowerment)** vs **manifestation of gifts (charismatic signs)**-each with distinct theological status.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a measured, confessional reply to charismatic excesses. 
 - Influenced pastors and seminary instruction seeking a balanced pneumatology that affirms Spirit-empowerment without abandoning covenantal categories.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a concise model for integrating pneumatology into Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology; helps pastors navigate charismatic experiences with theological clarity and pastoral sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism with the Holy Spirit:** The ontological act by which believers are incorporated into Christ and the church; normally coincident with conversion.
- **Filling of the Spirit:** Occasional empowerment for service, witness, or sanctification, distinguishable from the baptizing union with Christ.
- **Gifts/Manifestations:** Charismatic charismata (tongues, prophecy, healing) treated as potentially genuine but subordinate and regulable within the church.
- **Union with Christ:** The central category that gives theological priority to Spirit-baptism; frames soteriology and ecclesiology.
- **Means of grace:** Word and sacrament as ordinary conduits of the Spirit's work, including the baptismal reality.
- **Regeneration:** Spirit-work effecting new life; coheres with, and is not subsequent to, Spirit-baptism.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive transformation by the Spirit, linked to but not identical with episodic fillings.
- **Covenant community/body of Christ:** Ecclesial locus for discerning and ordering Spirit-work.
- **Scriptural testing/discernment:** Normative rule for evaluating charismatic claims; experiences are subordinate to Scripture.
- **Sacramental continuity:** Pentecost interpreted within sacramental and covenantal horizons-extraordinary does not negate ordinary means.
- **Sign vs substance:** Distinguishes outward charismatic signs from the inward substance of union and regeneration.
- **Pastoral prudence:** Emphasizes church oversight, maturity, and accountability for spiritual experiences.
- **Continuationism (qualified):** Allows for continuance of gifts but within Reformed constraints and norms.
- **Christocentric pneumatology:** The Spirit's work always oriented to Christ and his saving purposes.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed distinctions between Spirit-baptism and filling. 
 - As a **polemic resource** against excesses in charismatic popularizations. 
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for preaching, discipling, and ecclesial governance regarding spiritual experiences.
