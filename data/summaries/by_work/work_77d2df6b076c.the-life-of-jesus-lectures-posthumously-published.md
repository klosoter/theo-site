### TITLE
**The Life of Jesus** (Das Leben Jesu), lectures/essay; published posthumously 1835 - Friedrich Schleiermacher.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German theological culture: Romanticism, post-Kantian philosophy, rising historical-critical Biblical scholarship.
 - Schleiermacher (1768-1834): formative figure in modern Protestant theology; earlier work On Religion (1799) established "religion as feeling of absolute dependence."
 - The Life of Jesus appears at the end of his career and was issued posthumously (1835), entering a heated dialogue about the historical Jesus and orthodox Christology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reconstruct Jesus' life and significance by locating Christology in Jesus' singular **God-consciousness** (religious self-awareness) rather than metaphysical categories of preexistence or ontological Sonship.
 - Problem addressed: how to speak of the Incarnation and Sonship in an age of historical criticism and modern philosophy without reverting to dogmatic metaphysics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Portrait of Jesus as the paradigmatic human who exhibits the fullest, most perfect **feeling of absolute dependence** on God; this feeling grounds revelation.
 - Historical-critical reading of Gospel material to distinguish authentic utterances/acts emerging from Jesus' religious center from later church doctrinal overlays.
 - Reinterprets traditional categories (miracles, preexistence, atonement) in light of religious experience and moral-religious effect rather than metaphysical explanation.
 - Concludes that the significance of Jesus lies in his role as the **exemplar and revelation** of God through perfected divine-consciousness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the New Testament critically; dialogical relation to Kantian and Romantic philosophers (esp. concern for subjectivity and feeling).
 - Positioned against confessional orthodoxy; anticipates and intersects with the historical-critical movement (Strauss, later Ritschl, Baur).
 - Receives critique from conservative theologians for undermining classical formulations of Incarnation and eternal Sonship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central), Revelation (as event in consciousness), Incarnation (recast), Eternal Sonship (historicized/psychological), Miracles (reinterpreted), implicit soteriology (exemplarism rather than substitution).

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher centers the theological weight of Christianity on Jesus' perfected **God-consciousness**: the life of Jesus is the historical revelation of God's presence in human religious experience, not primarily a set of metaphysical propositions about preexistence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of **religious experience (Gefühl der Abhängigkeit)** over metaphysical speculation; Christology as description of a lived, conscious relation to God.
 - Jesus as **exemplar** and paradigmatic religious subject rather than primarily an ontological God-man.

- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects scholastic metaphysics that ground Sonship in ontological preexistence; contrasts with Chalcedonian/Patristic language that treats the Word's preexistence as first-order category.
 - Moves away from substitutionary or forensic emphases toward ethical-religious transformation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts **Incarnation** and **Sonship** in psychological-functional terms (Jesus' self-consciousness as Son), not primarily metaphysical terms.
 - Treats **revelation** as an existential event in collective/individual consciousness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Pivotal for 19th-century liberal Protestantism and historical Jesus research; shaped Ritschl, later liberal theology, and methodological approaches privileging experience and history.
 - Provoked sustained conservative backlash for perceived erosion of classical dogma.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological model for reconstructing the historical Jesus with theological sensitivity.
 - Clarifies how Christology can be reframed for modern philosophical horizons without abandoning devotion to the historical Jesus.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute dependence (Gefühl der Abhängigkeit)** - foundational religious feeling; Schleiermacher's basic datum for theology; Jesus manifests it in perfection.
- **God-consciousness** - the specific, heightened self-awareness of God in Jesus; the locus of revelation.
- **Exemplar / paradigmatic man** - Jesus as model for human relation to God; moral-religious primacy over metaphysical categories.
- **Incarnation (functional/psychological)** - incarnation described in terms of God's self-manifestation in human consciousness rather than metaphysical infusion of divinity.
- **Eternal Sonship (historicized)** - not primarily ontological preexistence but a description of Jesus' unique relation to God as disclosed in history.
 - Contrast: classical ontological Sonship (eternal, metaphysical) vs. Schleiermacher's experiential-functional Sonship.
- **Miracles (reinterpretive approach)** - treated critically; significance lies in religious meaning and conviction-formation, not necessarily breach of natural order.
- **Revelation as event-in-experience** - God is known in the experiential center of Jesus; revelation is existential rather than propositional.
- **Historical-critical method** - application to Gospel material to isolate authentic Jesus from later ecclesial accretions.
- **Exegesis of sayings/acts** - pragmatic criterion: assess sayings by their fit with Jesus' God-consciousness.
- **Mediatorship (ethical)** - Christ mediates God to humanity chiefly by example and perfect religious presence, not by metaphysical fusion.
- **Soteriology (exemplarist)** - salvation as orientation to God modeled by Jesus' consciousness, not juridical substitution.
- **Theological anthropology** - emphasizes capacity for divine-consciousness within humanity; Jesus as fulfillment.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for liberal and experience-grounded Christology (what counts as Sonship/Incarnation).
 - As a **polemic** against metaphysical ontologies in traditional dogma and against literalist miracle-claims.
 - As an **exegetical model** for historical-Jesus studies that privileges inner coherence with Jesus' religious center.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of revelation, shifting terminology from propositional truth to existential encounter.
