### TITLE
Dissertations on Subjects Connected with the Incarnation (1895) - Charles Gore

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-Victorian Anglican theology (published 1895). Gore writes from a High Church, patristically informed perspective while engaging contemporary German scholarship and the growing interest in philosophical and historical criticism. The essays respond to late-19th-century debates about Christ's person and consciousness, especially the rise of explicit **kenosis** theories.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to account for Christ's genuine human limitations (ignorance, suffering, change) without compromising the eternal, immutable divinity of the Son. Gore seeks a middle way: affirming real self-limitation (kenosis) in the economy without ontological diminution of the divine nature.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Philippians 2 and Gospel materials to show biblical warrant for "self-emptying."
 - Patristic and conciliar retrieval: marshals Athanasius, Cyril and Chalcedon to safeguard the **hypostatic union**.
 - Philosophical-theological distinction: separates ontological change in the divine nature from **functional or volitional self-limitation** exercised by the Son in the incarnation.
 - Critique of extremes:
 - Against radical kenotists who imply real loss or change in divine attributes.
 - Against approaches that render Christ's humanity merely apparent (docetism) or reduce the human element to a mask.
 - Positive proposal: kenosis as the Son's free, personal renunciation of the exercise of certain divine prerogatives within the economy of salvation, enabling true human experience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic authors (Athanasius, Cyril), the Chalcedonian tradition, contemporary German theologians and explicit kenoticists (e.g., Gottfried Thomasius and related 19th-century kenotic writings), and the broader climate of Ritschlian and historical-critical theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, kenosis, hypostatic union), doctrine of God (immutability, attributes), soteriology (atonement-related implications of Christ's self-emptying), and Christ's consciousness/personal experience.
- **Closing line**
 - Gore centers the Incarnation as a volitional, relational self-limitation of the eternal Son that secures genuine humanity without surrendering Chalcedonian divinity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a **volitional, personal kenosis**: the Son refrains from exercising divine attributes rather than undergoing ontological loss.
 - Careful balancing of biblical exegesis, patristic tradition, and critical scholarship; not anti-critical but conservative in doctrinal boundaries.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects radical kenotic formulations that posit change in the divine essence; opposes readings that collapse the distinction between God's immanent being and the economic activity of the Son.
 - Distinguishes his position from mechanistic or functionalist accounts that treat Christ's divine life as inaccessible or irrelevant to his human experience.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and rehabilitates the language of "emptying" (kenosis) as compatible with immutability by framing it as **self-limitation in exercise, not in nature**.
 - Emphasizes the role of personal consciousness and the Son's self-determining will within the hypostatic union.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Anglican High-Church and mainstream Catholic-Protestant conversations as a model of conservative engagement with modern theology.
 - Served as a touchstone in subsequent 20th-century Christological debates: praised for theological seriousness, criticized by some Reformed and continental theologians as insufficiently systematic or as compromising transcendence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for students seeking a historically rooted, theologically nuanced response to kenosis; a pedagogical exemplar of integrating patristic resources with modern questions about divine attributes and human experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - The Word becoming flesh; treated as the locus for discussing divine self-limitation.
- **Kenosis (self-emptying)** - Central term: interpreted as the Son's voluntary refraining from exercising divine prerogatives in the economic life.
 - Contrast: **ontological kenosis** (rejected) vs. **functional/volitional kenosis** (affirmed).
- **Hypostatic union** - The personal union of divine and human natures; used to protect against both reductionism and docetism.
- **Communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum)** - Employed to explain how divine and human predicates are ascribed to the one Person without confusion.
- **Divine attributes (immutability, omniscience, omnipotence)** - Discussed as retained in nature but not fully exercised in the incarnate state.
- **Economy vs. Immanence** - Distinction central to Gore: economic self-limitation need not imply inner change in the divine being.
- **Christ's consciousness** - Emphasized as genuinely human and shaped by voluntary divine self-limitation.
- **Humiliation and Exaltation** - Soteriological framework: humiliation (kenotic renunciation) followed by exaltation (resumption/fulfillment).
- **Patristic retrieval** - Use of Fathers and Chalcedon as hermeneutical anchors against speculative excesses.
- **Radical kenoticism** - Term for positions Gore critiques (those implying diminution of divinity).
- **Functional limitation** - Gore's preferred category to describe how divine power is not exercised, though not abolished.
- **Volition/will of the Son** - Key locus for explaining how kenosis is personal, not merely modal or substantial.
- **Soteriological implications** - How kenosis relates to atonement: genuine participation in human suffering enables real redemption.
- **Exegetical method** - Integration of grammatical-historical exegesis and doctrinal tradition.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** for a restrained, orthodox understanding of kenosis (functional, volitional).
 - As a **polemic** against both radical kenotic theories and docetic reductions.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Philippians 2 and Gospel data within patristic and conciliar categories.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Anglican and ecumenical Christological pedagogy seeking to reconcile classical orthodoxy with modern critical questions.
