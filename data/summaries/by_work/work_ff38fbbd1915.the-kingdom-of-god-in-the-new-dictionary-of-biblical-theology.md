### TITLE
The Kingdom of God - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (entry in The New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed biblical-theological conversation. Gaffin writes from a confessional Reformed perspective and a Westminster Seminary milieu, contributing a concise, theologically cautious synthesis for a major biblical-theology reference work.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The kingdom of God is the sovereign rule of the risen Christ inaugurated in his person, death, resurrection, and ascension; it is present in a real but partial way in the church by the Spirit and awaits consummation at Christ's return. The problem addressed is how to balance the biblical "already" of Christ's rule with the "not yet" of eschatological consummation, while guarding against both over-realized and purely future/speculative accounts.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of biblical usage (OT anticipation; synoptic and Johannine emphases) that grounds the kingdom in God's covenant promises and the Davidic/eschatological hope.
 - Christological pivot: Jesus as the eschatological king who inaugurates the kingdom by word, deed, death and especially resurrection - the resurrection as validation of his rule.
 - Pneumatological and ecclesiological mediation: the Spirit effects the kingdom's present administration in the church (worship, witness, sacraments) without collapsing the kingdom into the church.
 - Eschatological horizon: present power and ministry are provisional; consummation awaits parousia when the kingdom's rule is fully manifested over creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit engagement with Doddian "realized eschatology," George Ladd's "already/not yet" formulation, critiques of dispensational and radical social-gospel renderings of kingdom; draws on biblical-theological data across OT and NT and Reformed covenantal categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (kingly identity of Christ), eschatology (inaugurated/realized eschatology balanced with future consummation), ecclesiology (church as kingdom instrument), pneumatology (Spirit as agent of present reign), covenant and revelation (promise-fulfillment pattern).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The kingdom is the sovereign reign of the eschatological King inaugurated in Christ's person and work-present in power now through the Spirit and the church, yet consummated only at his return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong Christo-centricity: the kingdom is grounded decisively in the person and work of the risen Lord rather than in an abstract sociological program.
 - Resurrection as pivotal evidence of inaugurated rule-Gaffin stresses vindication (resurrection) as the decisive attestation of kingly authority.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects Doddian overemphasis on present realization by insisting on future consummation; resists any collapse of kingdom into merely present ecclesial/social institutions.
 - Distances from dispensational separation of church and kingdom while also resisting social-gospel reduction of the kingdom to social reform.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves:**
 - Prefers language of *reign/sovereignty* (rule) over merely spatial or institutional notions of "realm"; clarifies church as the sphere in which the reign is manifested, not identical with the reign.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a careful, orthodox corrective in NT/eschatological studies; used in teaching on Christology, eschatology, and ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact, theologically disciplined model that preserves biblical tensions without capitulating to extremes; valuable for pastors and students seeking a covenantal, Christ-centered account.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God:** God's sovereign rule; for Gaffin, primarily the reign exercised by Christ inaugurated in his redemptive work.
- **Kingdom of heaven:** Synonymous in NT usage (Gospel parallels), often Jewish circumlocution for "God."
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The view that eschatological realities have begun with Christ but await future completion; Gaffin affirms this with strong emphasis on the future consummation.
- **Already / Not yet:** Analytical shorthand Gaffin uses carefully-Christ's rule is real and present, but not yet universally consummated.
- **Consummation:** The future, decisive manifestation of Christ's sovereign rule at parousia.
- **Resurrection as vindication:** Resurrection functions as the decisive confirmation of Jesus' kingly authority and the inauguration of the kingdom.
- **Reign vs. realm (rule vs. place):** Terminological distinction stressing kingdom as God's rule/authority rather than merely a spatial or institutional domain.
- **Church (instrumental but distinct):** The community in which and through which the reign is manifested and advanced, not identical to the kingdom.
- **Covenant fulfillment:** Kingdom rooted in OT promises brought to fulfillment in Christ.
- **Pneumatological mediation:** Spirit as present agent effecting and applying the reign in the meantime.
- **Critique of realized eschatology:** Rejection of interpretations that eliminate the eschatological future.
- **Anti-dispensational move:** Upholds continuity between covenant promises and their fulfillment in Christ, resisting sharp church/kingdom separations.
- **Eschatological presence:** The notion that eschatological power is present now in a partial form.

How this work is used:
- As a concise **definition source** for "kingdom" in Reformed biblical-theological curricula.
- As a **polemic** against both over-realized (Doddian/social-gospel) and purely futurist/dispensational accounts.
- As an **exegetical-conceptual model** linking Christology, resurrection, Spirit, and church in presentations of New Testament eschatology.
