### TITLE
**Revelation and Reason** - Emil Brunner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early to mid-20th century dialectical theology, post-liberal, post-Kantian, engaging Protestant scholasticism and modern religious consciousness.
 - Alongside the Brunner-Barth disputes over natural theology and orders of creation; indebted to Kierkegaard, Buber, and Reformed sources.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can finite, fallen human reason know the infinite, holy God? Answer: only through God's **self-revelation** in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit; reason serves but cannot generate this knowledge. Revelation is an **event of personal address** that yields genuine cognitive content.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern idealism and liberalism collapse revelation into human consciousness; scholastic rationalism domesticates God.
 - Revelation defined: God's sovereign, free self-disclosure; personal, historical, Christ-centered, Spirit-empowered; Scripture as authoritative **witness and vehicle**.
 - Faith and knowledge: faith is obedience to the personal Word, yet it involves true knowledge; truth is not merely propositional nor irrational.
 - Reason rehabilitated: fallen yet instrumentally necessary; capable of formal operations and receptive structures, not of material discovery of saving truth.
 - Creation and covenant: the Creator-creature relation grounds a **point of contact** in the imago Dei (formal), while the material likeness is lost and restored in Christ.
 - Church and proclamation: the kerygma mediates the event of revelation; Word and Spirit inseparable; theology is critical service to proclamation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kant, Kierkegaard, Luther, Calvin, Augustine, Aquinas; converses with Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Troeltsch; disputes and overlaps with Barth; influenced by Buber's I-Thou personalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture**; **faith and knowledge**; **imago Dei and natural knowledge**; **Christ as Revealer and Revelation**; **Trinity** as the form of God's self-communication; **Spirit** as the power of revelation; **covenant and orders of creation**.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: God's triune self-giving in Christ, through the Spirit, summoning covenantal faith that truly knows.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Revelation as **personal encounter** that is simultaneously event and truth.
 - **Formal/material imago Dei** distinction enabling a limited point of contact without conceding salvific knowledge to nature.
 - Scripture as **authoritative witness** that, in the Spirit, becomes the living Word to the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against liberalism: revelation is not religious self-consciousness.
 - Against rationalism: God is not an object within a system; knowledge is from above.
 - Against strict Barthianism: affirms a modest **Anknuepfungspunkt** and creational orders; maintains cognitive content in revelation without reducing it to propositions.
 - Against scholastic natural theology: no direct ladder to God; creation yields only fragmentary, ambiguous awareness of God as Creator.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Revelation-as-encounter**; **point of contact**; **orders of creation** articulated within a dialectical framework; reassertion of **kerygma** as the locus of God's address.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read across Reformed and ecumenical circles; formative for mid-century evangelical epistemology and preaching.
 - Critiqued by Barthians for natural-theology concessions; by confessional Reformed for event-language about Scripture.
 - Utilized in missiology and homiletics for integrating proclamation, Spirit, and knowledge.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear map of revelation, faith, and reason for teaching theology proper, Scripture, and Christology.
 - Pedagogically useful for distinguishing personal revelation from both fideism and rationalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation-as-encounter**: God's self-communication as personal address that creates faith and knowledge.
- **Word of God**: Primarily Christ; secondarily the preached and written word as Spirit-used witness.
- **Faith as obedience**: Trustful assent that is simultaneously knowledge; opposes both mere assent and mere experience.
- **Reason (ministerial)**: Necessary instrument for theology, critiqued and redirected by revelation; not constitutive of saving truth.
- **Point of contact (Anknuepfungspunkt)**: Creational capacity and conscience remain; no saving content apart from Christ.
 - Formal vs material: formal image persists; material righteousness lost and restored in Christ.
- **General vs special revelation**: General gives ambiguous awareness of God; special is Christic, salvific, and normative.
- **Kerygma**: Proclamation through which revelation addresses; event-character without abandoning content.
- **Orders of creation**: Structures of life under God's providence; good yet fallen; inform ethics and civic life.
- **Analogia fidei**: Knowledge by faith in God's self-speaking; rejects analogia entis as a path to God.
- **Scripture as witness**: Norming norm as Spirit-breathed testimony; authority tied to God's self-attestation.
- **Christ the Revealer**: The personal content and medium of revelation; cross and resurrection as disclosure.
- **Trinitarian self-revelation**: The Father reveals in the Son by the Spirit; economic action grounds true knowledge of God.
- **Spirit and Word inseparability**: The Spirit actualizes the Word's address, creating faith and understanding.
- **Truth as event and content**: Personal yet cognitive; neither bare propositions nor irrational leap.

- **How the work is used across loci**
 - As a definition-source for revelation, faith, and Scripture's authority within a Christocentric frame.
 - As a polemic against liberalism, rationalism, and naive natural theology, while nuancing creation and conscience.
 - As a conceptual pivot for covenantal personalism in theology proper, Trinity, Christology, and ethics.
 - As a methodological guide for preaching and doctrinal method: Word-and-Spirit, event-and-proposition held together.
