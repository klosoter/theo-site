### TITLE
**B.B. Warfield, "The Divine and Human in the Bible" (Selected Shorter Writings)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton theology; reaction to rising historical-critical liberalism and to mechanistic views of inspiration.
 - Warfield stands within conservative Reformed/Princetonians who defend orthodox doctrines of Scripture using careful historical, philosophical, and theological argumentation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Bible is both genuinely **divine** and genuinely **human**; this duality must be accounted for theologically so that Scripture's divine authority and human form are reconciled without reducing one to the other.
 - Problem: how to affirm plenary inspiration and inerrancy while recognizing human modes, idioms, and development.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of divine authorship: Scripture is ultimately from God (authority, inerrancy in original autographs).
 - Affirmation of true human authorship: individual writers, historical and cultural forms, literary variety and personality left intact.
 - Accommodation thesis: God communicates within human capacities and idioms; divine truth is expressed in finite human forms.
 - Incarnational analogy: the divine-human union of Scripture is analogous (not identical) to the incarnation-God speaks through human instruments without divine dictation.
 - Practical corollary: hermeneutics must respect human authorial intention and genres while upholding canonical authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Opposes liberal critics who naturalize Scripture and deny supernatural revelation.
 - Corrects simplistic dictation models-dialogue with conservative fundamentals and historical-critical method.
 - Draws on Scripture, patristic and Reformed confessional thought, and contemporary epistemology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration (plenary, verbal nuance), authority and inerrancy, Christology (analogy to incarnation), anthropology (human authorship and nature), hermeneutics.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's center of gravity: Scripture is a divine word mediated in human words-an incarnational form of revelation that preserves divine authority while honoring human linguistic and historical reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong defense of **plenary inspiration** combined with a robust affirmation of genuine human authorship and style.
 - Systematic use of the **incarnational analogy**: Scripture's divine-human union is treated analogically to Christ's two natures-helpful for avoiding both dictationism and naturalism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects mechanical dictation theories (which obliterate human authorial personality).
 - Opposes liberal reduction of Scripture to mere human product (which denies supernatural revelation).
 - More philosophically sophisticated than some contemporaneous fundamentalists; more conservative than critical scholarship.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes **accommodation** in a way that protects doctrinal content while explaining human form; nuances "verbal" inspiration with attention to idiom and literary forms.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a moderating, scholarly defense of inerrancy.
 - Shaped subsequent doctrinal formulations of inspiration at Princeton and in later confessional statements.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to hold **divine authority** and **human particularity** together; valuable for theological method, hermeneutics, and doctrinal formulation courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine authorship**
 - Scripture's ultimate origin in God, grounding authority and inerrancy (in original autographs).

- **Human authorship**
 - Real, personal contributions of biblical writers: style, perspective, historical context.

- **Plenary inspiration**
 - Full inspiration of Scripture's content while allowing for human modes of expression.

- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture's freedom from error in what it intends to affirm; Warfield defends this without endorsing mechanical dictation.

- **Accommodation**
 - God's condescension to human capacity and language; explains imperfections of form without conceding error in truth-claims.
 - Tied closely to the incarnational analogy: God condescends in speech as in the Word made flesh.

- **Incarnational analogy**
 - Theologizes Scripture's divine-human union by analogy with Christ's two natures: helpful guard against dualistic reduction of either side.

- **Dichotomy vs Trichotomy**
 - Warfield's anthropology: tends toward **dichotomous** realism (body + immaterial aspect) and resists speculative ontological trichotomy.
 - He allows functional/typological distinctions (e.g., spirit and soul as distinct in function or experience) without positing three separate ontological components.

- **Authority and hermeneutics**
 - Method insists on historical-grammatical exegesis within a theological framework that presumes divine origin.

- **Analogy and analogy-limits**
 - Warfield stresses analogy without collapsing divine-human distinction; analogies are aids, not identities.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for incarnational models of revelation and a disciplined account of accommodation.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal naturalism and mechanistic dictation models of inspiration.
 - As an **exegetical model** that insists on taking human literary form seriously while arguing for canonical authority.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on anthropological formulations (dichotomy vs trichotomy) and on the nature of Scripture's divine-human union.
