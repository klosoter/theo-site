### TITLE
**Principles of Systematic Theology** - John Webster (International Journal of Systematic Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th / early 21st-century Anglican-Reformed context. Webster writes within a post-Barthian, Reformed retrieval movement that reacts to Enlightenment models of theology-as-science and to liberal, correlational, and purely epistemological accounts of doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Systematic theology must root its principia in the God who reveals himself in the Word, not in human epistemic foundations or scientific method; theology is faithful speech about God formed by encounter with divine revelation.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Critique of "theology as science": rejects treating theology as an autonomous, methodological discipline modeled on the natural sciences. 
 - Reassertion of doctrinal principia as derivatively grounded in the Triune God's self-disclosure (Scripture and Christ as the norm and content). 
 - Method conceived liturgically and ecclesially: theology as service to the church's confessing speech, not as neutral theorizing. 
 - Practical moves: reframe dogmatic questions through Trinitarian and Christological categories; emphasize Word-event and sacramental mediation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages Karl Barth and T. F. Torrance for their insistence on revelation-centered theology. 
 - Contrasts with Enlightenment epistemology, Schleiermacher-style correlationism, and positivist models of scientific theology. 
 - Draws on classical Reformed and patristic resources (Calvinic doctrinal shape, Trinitarian tradition).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Revelation (Word-event), Trinity (as constitutive principle), Christology (center of doctrinal articulation), Scripture (norm); subsidiarily: ecclesiology, sacrament, providence, and the doctrine of God's freedom.
- **Closing line:** 
 Theology's true principia are revealed, relational, and doxological: systematic theology must begin and end with the God who speaks in Christ to his people rather than with human-methodological presuppositions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Principia are not methodological axioms but the God-wrought realities (Word, covenant, Trinitarian relations) that shape theological discourse. 
 - Theology as ecclesial speech and liturgical practice rather than as abstract knowledge-production.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects Schleiermacher-style correlation that begins with human religious consciousness; insists on priority of divine initiative. 
 - Pushes back against treating theology like a natural science (methodological autonomy, objectification). 
 - Moves beyond certain Barthian emphases by insisting on sustained doctrinal exposition and ecclesial form rather than abrupt negation of tradition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Recasts "principle" (principia) to mean revelatory starting points (Word/Trinity) instead of epistemic foundations. 
 - Emphasizes "Word-event" as central operative category for theology's content and method.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely influential in contemporary Reformed and Anglican dogmatic renewal; used in postgraduate theological education and as a corrective to secularizing trends. 
 - Stimulated renewed attention to Trinitarian, liturgical, and ecclesial shape of dogmatics; admired by those seeking a doctrinally robust alternative to liberal and purely analytic approaches. 
 - Criticized by some for dense prose and for placing heavy weight on Barthian categories, raising questions about ecumenical applicability.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Offers a durable corrective to methodological naturalism and epistemic reductionism. 
 - Serves as a bridge between confessional dogmatics and contemporary theological method, useful for teaching systematic theology as church-embedded doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia (principles):** foundational starting points for theology reinterpreted as God's self-revelation rather than human epistemic axioms. 
- **Word / Word-event:** revelation is an event in which God speaks; theology must attend to that event as its norm and content. 
- **Trinity:** the constitutive context for all theological talk; doctrine of God frames method and content. 
- **Christocentrism:** Christ as the decisive lens for ordering doctrine and for identifying principia. 
- **Theology as ecclesial speech:** theology belongs to the church's confessing and liturgical life, not to neutral scholarship alone. 
- **Anti-scientism (theology vs. science model):** a critique of treating theology on the model of natural science; warns against methodological autonomy. 
- **Revelational primacy:** divine initiative precedes and dictates theological method and questions. 
- **Dogmatics:** systematic, doctrinal exposition ordered by faithfulness to Scripture and the church's confession. 
- **Correlation critique:** rejects making human experience the starting point for theological construction. 
- **Promise / covenantal idiom:** theological content framed through God's promises and covenant action. 
- **Normativity of Scripture:** Scripture as the normative witness to the Word-event; not merely a historical source among others. 
- **Liturgical-ontological overlap:** insistence that worship and reality of God are interwoven; ontology of doctrine emerges in ecclesial practice. 
- **Apophaticism (qualified):** restrained negative theology acknowledging God's transcendence while affirming revelation in Christ. 
- **Theological method (principia theology as science):** reframing the debate about whether theology is a 'science'-Webster insists principia must remain revelatory, Trinitarian, and ecclesial.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary theological method emphasizing revelatory principia. 
 - As a **polemic** against secularized, scientistic, or correlational approaches to systematic theology. 
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot**, encouraging exegetical and doctrinal work structured by Trinitarian and Christological categories.
