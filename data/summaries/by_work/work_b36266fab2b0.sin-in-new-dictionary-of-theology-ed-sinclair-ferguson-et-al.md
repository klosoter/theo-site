### TITLE
"Sin" - Henri Blocher, in New Dictionary of Theology (ed. Sinclair Ferguson et al.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical Reformed milieu; contribution to a conservative, academically oriented dictionary intended for pastors, students, and scholars seeking concise orthodox treatments.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** to explicate the **nature and origin of sin** in a manner faithful to Scripture and tradition, reconciling biblical exegesis, theological history, and pastoral concern about culpability, solidarity, and the remedy in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of Genesis and Pauline texts to locate the Fall and Adam's role as representative.
 - Historical-theological appraisal: interaction with **Augustine, Pelagius, Calvin**, and later interpreters; assessment of classical formulations (privatio boni, original guilt, transmitted corruption).
 - Theological synthesis: sin as a relational rupture (against reduction to mere ontology) and as transmitted condition (against purely individualistic accounts).
 - Soteriological implication: Christ as the **second Adam** reverses the solidarity that makes sin both corporate and personal.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** primary biblical authors (Genesis, Paul), Augustine and Pelagius as poles, Reformers (Calvin), selected modern theologians (critics of classical original sin, existential and structural accounts), biblical scholarship concerning headship and solidarity.
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology (imago Dei), original sin (guilt and corruption), actual sin, freedom and will, covenant/federal headship, Christology (Christ as representative), soteriology (atonement, justification).
- **Closing line:** Blocher centers the doctrine on **relational rupture under federal headship**: sin is both a corrupted human condition transmitted in solidarity with Adam and a series of responsible acts, all of which find their definitive remedy in Christ the corporate Redeemer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced biblicism:** Blocher insists on first reading the biblical data (Genesis, Romans) before imposing philosophical categories; privileges scriptural motifs of representation and covenant.
- **Relational rather than merely metaphysical language:** favors speaking of sin as a **breaking of covenantal relationship and loss of original righteousness** (privatio-style language retained but recontextualized).
- **Integration of corporate and individual dimensions:** emphasizes **solidarity** - Adam's headship explains how sin is transmitted - while maintaining individual moral responsibility for actual sins.
- **Corrective to modern individualism and reductive naturalism:** critiques accounts that reduce sin to pathology, ignorance, or social structure alone; also resists purely existentialist interpretations that detach sin from historical grounding.
- **Terminological moderation:** avoids making sin an ontological substance; presents original sin as a condition (corruption, propensity) accompanied by representative imputation of guilt in covenantal language.
- **Reception and influence:** widely used in Reformed and evangelical contexts as a succinct, scholarly, pastorally sensitive treatment; cited for its careful balance between Augustinian resources and contemporary concerns about justice and corporate sin.
- **Enduring value:** pedagogically useful for teaching how to hold together biblical exegesis, patristic-Reformation categories, and modern critiques without collapsing distinctions essential for orthodox soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin:** inherited condition affecting human nature and orientation toward God; for Blocher, a transmitted corruption grounded in Adam's representative failure.
- **Inherited guilt (imputation):** the idea that Adam's culpability is reckoned to his descendants within the framework of federal headship.
- **Original corruption:** the privation or distortion of the imago Dei that inclines humans to sin.
- **Federal headship / representation:** Adam as corporate head whose act bears consequences for the human race; central to explaining collective culpability.
- **Imago Dei (image of God):** originally righteous relational capacity now marred but not entirely obliterated; the locus of sin's damage and God's renewing work.
- **Privatio boni (privation of good):** classical Augustinian formula retained as analytic: sin defined negatively as lack/absence of right relation to God.
- **Actual sin:** concrete, responsible acts of rebellion that flow from the corrupted condition but remain personally culpable.
- **Structural / corporate sin:** social and institutional dimensions of sin that reflect and perpetuate personal sin; Blocher integrates these without dissolving personal guilt.
- **Freedom / will:** human freedom is real but disordered; sin is a misuse of freedom rather than an ontological necessity.
- **Second Adam / Christology:** Christ as representative head whose obedience and righteousness reverse Adam's federal role.
- **Temptation and concupiscence:** empirical manifestations of the corrupted inclination; distinguished from imputable guilt.
- **Death and bondage to sin:** principal consequences of the Fall (physical, spiritual, and relational).
- **Covenant framework:** interpretive grid for understanding transmission, obligation, and remedy.
- **Total depravity (qualified):** affirmed as pervasive corruption of faculties but not as absolute inability - preserves responsibility and the necessity of grace.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a clear **definition source** for original sin that threads biblical, patristic, and Reformation emphases.
- As a **polemic resource** against Pelagianism, modern individualism, and overly sociological accounts that deny personal culpability.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Adam/Paulic texts-useful in theological anthropology and soteriology discussions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed teaching to hold together representation, corporate solidarity, and individual moral responsibility.
