### TITLE
The Doctrine of God (Anonymous synthesis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** A contemporary, pedagogical-systematic synthesis emergent from Reformed-evangelical and historic Protestant trajectories. Functions as a site-wide doctrinal anchor used in academic, pastoral, and catechetical contexts; draws on patristic, medieval, scholastic, Reformed orthodox, and recent analytic and constructive theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God is the triune, self-existent Creator whose being (ontological attributes) and saving acts (economic history) are inseparable: correct doctrine of God must hold classical theism and Trinitarian, covenantal, and Christocentric revelation in constructive unity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Biblical revelation: survey of divine names, deeds, and narrative self-disclosure (YHWH, Father, Son, Spirit) as normative for doctrine.
 - Classical articulation: systematic treatment of incommunicable and communicable attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, omniscience, omnipotence, holiness, goodness, love).
 - Trinitarian and Christological correlation: distinction and relation between immanent and economic Trinity; the incarnation as interpretive key for divine action and covenant life.
 - Practical implications: creation and providence, humanity as imago Dei, sin and election, Christ as divine Redeemer, Spirit as sanctifier, church and sacraments as covenant signs.
 - Doctrinal application: how divine attributes inform soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, and ethical life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Athanasius, Aquinas, Calvin, Bavinck, Barth, Torrance, contemporary analytic theists and open-theism critics; engagement with process theology, liberal theology, existentialist readings, and modern biblical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation (general and special), covenant (works and grace), Trinity (economic/immanent distinction; perichoresis), Christology (incarnation, two natures, communicatio idiomatum), providence, creation, anthropology, soteriology, ecclesiology, sacraments, pneumatology, attributes of God.
- **Closing line:** Theology of God here centers on a **covenantal, triune, and Christocentric theism** in which God's eternal being and redemptive acts are one coherent revelation grounding all doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on reading classical attributes through the lens of the Trinity and redemption - attributes are not abstractions but disclosed in covenantal acts.
 - Priority of **covenant** as the mode by which divine will, being, and action are known and lived.
 - Balanced use of metaphysical categories (simplicity, aseity) alongside pastoral and biblical exposition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects deistic and purely metaphysical readings by rooting attributes in revelation and covenant history.
 - Offers a corrective to both radical Barthianism (which can downplay classical metaphysics) and liberal reductionisms (which demythologize God).
 - Targets open theism and process theology by upholding divine foreknowledge, immutability, and sovereign providence without abandoning relationality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Language of **"covenantal being"** - an attempt to articulate divine eternity as relational and volitional without collapsing into temporality.
 - Emphasizes **perichoretic agency** to explain intra-Trinitarian relations as formative for mission and economy.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited across site resources; influential in linking doctrine of God to Christology, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology.
 - Used by pastors and teachers for systematic courses; taken up in ecumenical dialogues as a bridge between classical and contemporary formulations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear pedagogical ordering from revelation to application.
 - Integrative model that preserves doctrinal continuity while engaging present debates; fertile for cross-loci theological work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; God as source of being, not dependent on creation.
- **Divine simplicity:** Denial of metaphysical composition in God; attributes identical with divine essence.
- **Immutability:** Enduring faithfulness and non-change in God's essential being; qualified by economic relations and covenantal action.
- **Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence:** Classical perfections held robustly, with careful pastoral and exegetical qualifications regarding human freedom and providence.
- **Trinity (immanent/economic):** Distinction between God's eternal life (immanent) and God's actions in history (economic); perichoresis stresses relationality.
- **Covenant (works/grace):** Covenant as the structural mode of divine-human relations and theological interpretation; Christ as covenant-fulfiller.
- **Christocentricity:** Interpretation of all divine attributes and actions through the person and work of Christ.
- **Perichoresis:** Mutual indwelling of Father, Son, and Spirit - theological key to divine unity and multiplicity.
- **Providence:** Sovereign governance of creation that sustains freedom and contingency; connects to election and human responsibility.
- **Imago Dei:** Human vocation and dignity grounded in relational and representative likeness to God; link to sanctification and ecclesial identity.
- **Revelation (general/special):** General revelation manifests divine power and glory; special revelation (Scripture, Word incarnate) is determinative for doctrine.
- **Communicable vs incommunicable attributes:** Distinction used to explain moral and relational sharing of God's virtues with creatures.
- **Election:** Sovereign choice within covenantal framework, oriented to Christ and mission.
- **Sacramental theology:** Sacraments as covenant signs grounded in Trinitarian and Christ-centered doctrine.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for doctrinal courses and entry-level systematic theology summaries.
 - As a **polemic** or conceptual resource against open theism, process theology, and reductive liberal readings.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking biblical names/acts of God to systematic categories (attributes, Trinity).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting doctrine of God to Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology, and sacramental practice.
