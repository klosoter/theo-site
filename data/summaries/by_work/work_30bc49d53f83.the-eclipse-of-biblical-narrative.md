### TITLE
The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative - Hans W. Frei

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century theological renewal at Yale; Frei published his essay/book-length treatment in the 1970s as part of wider conversations about narrative theology and the "Yale School." It interacts with Enlightenment hermeneutics, 19th-century historical criticism, Schleiermacherian Romantic hermeneutics, and 20th-century demythologizing trends.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Modern hermeneutical shifts in the 18th-19th centuries have effectively *eclipsed* the Bible's narrative force-its capacity to present real persons, events, and claim-making speech-so that biblical stories are no longer read as narratively constitutive of theological truth. Frei contends theology must recover the narrative's own mode of reference if doctrine (especially Christology and revelation) is to be coherent.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical diagnosis: traces how Enlightenment rationalism, Romantic inwardness (Schleiermacher), and historical-critical reconstruction (Tübingen school, later forms) stripped biblical narrative of its public referentiality.
 - Consequences: narrative figures become psychological types, moral exemplars, or theological devices rather than depicted persons-in-a-world; doctrines become abstractions divorced from the story.
 - Normative move: advocate for a reading that honors the narrative's own world-making - seeing biblical narrative as presenting persons and events that function theologically by virtue of their narrative reality.
 - Methodological implication: theology must begin with the Bible's self-presentation, attending to narrative form, voice, and canonical shaping rather than subordinating story to extrinsic philosophical or historiographic schemas.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Enlightenment and Romantic hermeneuticians broadly (e.g., Schleiermacher), 19th-century historical-critical currents (Tübingen, radical criticism), 20th-century demythologizers (Bultmannian tendencies), and later postliberal interpreters (Lindbeck, Hauerwas) who built on Frei's recovery.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (as narrated self-disclosure), Christology (identity of Jesus as a narrative figure whose claim must be read within story-world), authority of Scripture, typology vs. historicity, soteriology as narrative event rather than mere doctrine.
- **Closing line:** Frei's theological center of gravity: recover the Bible's narrative integrity-its presentation of particular persons and events-as the proper locus for theological truth and for credible, non-reductionist Christology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasizes *narrative realism* - the idea that biblical stories instantiate a world and persons who are the theological subjects rather than mere exemplars or hypotheses.
 - Uses the metaphor of an "eclipse" to diagnose a long-term hermeneutical malfunction rather than a single modern error.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects liberal theological tendencies that reduce Scripture to ethical or religious experience.
 - Opposes demythologizing and existentialist reductions (e.g., Bultmannian moves) that evacuate narrative reference.
 - Distinguishes itself from naive historicism by arguing for narrative referentiality without collapsing into historiographic reconstructionism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** Re-centers theological method on the category of the biblical narrative-world; foregrounds the notion of characters-as-present-in-the-story rather than as mere historical hypotheses or abstractions.
- **Reception and influence:** Foundational for the Yale School/postliberal and narrative theology movements; deeply influential in theological hermeneutics, preaching theory, and certain strands of biblical theology. Criticized by some historians and biblical scholars for downplaying historical-critical commitments and by others for alleged inward canonical isolation.
- **Enduring value:** Supplies a corrective to reductionist readings, equips teachers and preachers with a principled rationale for narrative-based proclamation, and supplies a methodological pivot for recovering theological claims embedded in story.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eclipse of narrative:** Frei's central metaphor for the historical and hermeneutical processes that have obscured biblical narrative's claim-making power.
- **Narrative realism:** The claim that biblical narratives present persons and events as real within their narrative world and that this reality is constitutive for theology.
- **Plain sense / narrative sense:** Reading the story on its own terms - attending to its world, characters, and propositional claims as presented.
- **Historical-critical method (as critique):** Identified as a major force that, when uncritically applied, reduces narrative content to hypotheses or psychological types.
- **Demythologization:** The move to translate narrative motifs into existential or ethical meanings; Frei critiques its tendency to remove narrative referentiality.
- **Typological reduction:** Reading biblical persons primarily as types or moral exemplars rather than as particular persons within a story-world.
- **Canonical reading:** Attention to the Bible as an ordered corpus where narrative shape and placement matter for theological sense.
- **Biblical self-presentation:** The rule that Scripture's own mode of address should guide theological appropriation.
- **Identity of Jesus (narrative locus):** Frei's Christological focus: Jesus' identity is to be understood within the narrative presentation, not merely by external dogmatic schemas.
- **Yale School / postliberalism:** The broader theological movement that adopts Frei's narrative emphases for doctrinal and ecclesial retrieval.
- **Hermeneutical restoration:** The programmatic aim to recover a reading practice that respects narrative force.
- **Exemplary reading:** Term for the rival approach that Frei critiques - treating biblical characters as moral examples detached from narrative identity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a methodological definition source for narrative theology and canonical reading strategies.
- As a polemic against both liberal reductionism and demythologizing existentialism.
- As an exegetical model guiding preaching and theological interpretation that foregrounds the story-world.
- As a conceptual pivot in postliberal debates about authority, doctrine, and the relation of Scripture to historical inquiry.
