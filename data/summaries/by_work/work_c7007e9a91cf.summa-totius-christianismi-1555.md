### TITLE
Summa Totius Christianismi (1555) - Theodore Beza

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation Geneva; Beza as Calvin's immediate successor and chief exegete for the Genevan Academy.
 - Published 1555 as a compact systematic compendium to teach Reformed doctrine to ministers and students amid Catholic/ Lutheran polemics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To present a concise, juridical and covenantal account of Christian doctrine: sinners are condemned by the law but justified by the gospel through Christ; Christian life is ordered by the covenant of grace and guided by the moral law.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic loci treating Scripture, God (Trinity), creation, sin, Christ (person and work), justification, sanctification, sacraments, church and magistrate, and eschatology.
 - Major moves:
 - Affirm Scripture as sole rule (sola scriptura) and Christ as center of revelation.
 - Diagnose human sin under the law (condemnation, impotence to fulfill covenant of works).
 - Proclaim justification by faith consisting in the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness.
 - Distinguish the roles of law and gospel for conviction, justification, and sanctified life.
 - Define sacraments as means of grace in a spiritual/representative (anti‑transubstantiation) sense.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Calvin and Augustine; polemically addresses Roman Catholic scholastic positions (merit, sacramental efficacy) and clarifies divergences with Lutheran emphases on law/gospel application.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture authority; Trinity and Christology (two natures, one person); original sin; justification (forensic imputation); predestination; sanctification; law (moral/ceremonial/distinct uses); sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper); ecclesiology; magistracy; eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - A compact, juridical summation of Reformed Christianity that sharpens the law/gospel distinction and anchors soteriology in covenantal and forensic terms.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong, pedagogical sharpening of the **law-gospel distinction**: law deposes and drives to Christ; gospel alone justifies by imputing Christ's righteousness.
 - Clear juridical language: salvation set forth as forensic imputation rather than inherent infusion.
 - Early systematic articulation that anticipates later Reformed covenantal ordering.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Places Calvinian clarifications into compact form and distinguishes Reformed positions from both Roman Catholic sacramental-merit theology and certain Lutheran readings that conflate uses of the law.
 - Counters Roman claims of infused righteousness and sacramental ex opere operato efficacy.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Operationalizes a threefold use of the law (civil restraint, moral rule, and pedagogical/condemnatory use) in concise catechetical fashion.
 - Frames justification and sanctification as distinct loci related by covenantal promise and Spirit-enabled obedience.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed academies and preaching; influential among Huguenot and English Reformed circles.
 - Served as a stepping stone toward later Reformed orthodoxy and scholastic systems (helping shape debates that produced Gomarus/Arminius and later scholastic formulations).
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a compact pedagogical manual for the law/gospel dialectic and for teaching forensic soteriology, sacramental theology, and Reformed ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Law: reveals sin, condemns, and functions as a tutor to drive to Christ.
 - Gospel: proclamation of Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; alone grounds justification.
- **Justification (forensic imputation)**
 - Declared righteous by faith because of Christ's merits, not by inherent works.
- **Imputed Righteousness**
 - Christ's obedience and satisfaction counted to the believer before God.
- **Covenant (works / grace)**
 - Covenant of works: failed by Adam; Covenant of grace: fulfilled in Christ and mediated by promise and sacraments.
- **Predestination**
 - Divine election presented with juridical certainty; sovereignty of God in salvation affirmed.
- **Sanctification / good works**
 - Sanctification as a Spirit-work producing obedience; good works are fruits and evidences, not grounds, of salvation.
- **Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper)**
 - Means of grace that signify and seal promises; oppose transubstantiation and questionable corporeal presence doctrines.
- **Authority of Scripture (sola scriptura)**
 - Scripture as ultimate rule for doctrine and life; tradition judged by Scripture.
- **Moral vs. Ceremonial Law**
 - Moral law normative for Christian conduct; ceremonial law abrogated as to rite, retained as pedagogy historically.
- **Forensic / juridical language**
 - Legal metaphors for guilt, imputation, pardon, and righteousness dominate soteriological explanation.
- **Role of Magistrate and Church**
 - Distinct but cooperative spheres; civil order should uphold true religion while church disciplines doctrine and worship.
- **Use of Augustine and Calvin**
 - Theological method relies on patristic and Calvinian precedent for doctrinal authority.
- **Atonement (satisfaction/substitution)**
 - Christ's death as penal substitution satisfying divine justice.
- **Threefold use of the law**
 - Civil restraint, pedagogical/condemnatory, and normative moral rule for believers.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a concise definitional source for Reformed doctrine in teaching and catechesis.
 - As polemical ammunition against Catholic sacramental and merit-based soteriology and to clarify distinctions with Lutheran positions.
 - As an exegetical-pedagogical model emphasizing law/gospel reading of Scripture and a conceptual pivot toward covenantal and forensic frameworks.
