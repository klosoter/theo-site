### TITLE
"The Active and Passive Obedience of Christ" - John Murray, Westminster Theological Journal (1955)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholastic setting; Murray as professor at Westminster Theological Seminary, writing within the classical Westminster/Calvinian tradition.
 - Reaction against modern reductions of atonement (moral influence, existentialist readings) and against tendencies to minimize the forensic/doctrinal dimensions of justification.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ's obedience is twofold: **active obedience** (perfectly fulfilling the law in life) and **passive obedience** (suffering and death in the sinner's stead). Both are necessary and imputed to believers for full justification.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical grounding in Pauline soteriology (esp. Romans) and other New Testament texts that teach imputation and righteousness.
 - Theological-historical demonstration of the doctrine in Reformation and Westminster standards; careful delimitation from Roman Catholic, Socinian, and modern reinterpretations.
 - Logical articulation: passive obedience removes guilt and penalty; active obedience furnishes positive righteousness required by justification.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal ramifications: assurance, regeneration, covenantal standing before God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Reformation writers (Calvin), Westminster Confession and divines, and patristic/scriptural witness; opposes modern critics who treat Christ's obedience as merely exemplary or who deny the imputation of active obedience.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (office and work), soteriology (justification, imputation, penal substitution), covenant theology (covenant of works/ grace), law and gospel, forensic/declared righteousness.
- **Closing line**
 - Murray insists the gospel's center is the imputed **whole obedience** of Christ-both life and death-without which justification would be deficient.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, precise insistence on the necessity of **active obedience** as the source of the believer's positive righteousness, not merely the removal of guilt by passive obedience.
 - Integration of covenantal categories: Christ as covenant-representative fulfilling covenant demands.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects views that reduce Christ's work to exemplary moral teaching, existential transformation, or solely penal suffering.
 - Rejects positions that claim passive obedience alone secures all aspects of justification.
- **Conceptual clarity**
 - Careful terminological delimitation between obedience as covenant fulfillment and obedience as sufferings endured; avoids conflation of sanctification with forensic righteousness.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard concise defense in mid-to-late 20th century Reformed theology; widely cited in seminary instruction and in later defenses of classical imputation theology.
 - Provoked ongoing debate with those emphasizing union with Christ and participatory (rather than strictly forensic) accounts of justification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, compact model for teaching the double aspect of Christ's obedience; valued for exegetical sobriety and systematic coherence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience**
 - Christ's perfect fulfillment of the law in his life; supplies the positive righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Passive obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death bearing the penalty of sin; secures forgiveness and removal of guilt.
- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer: our sin to Christ; his obedience (both active and passive) to believers.
- **Justification**
 - A declarative, forensic act by which God treats the sinner as righteous on account of Christ's imputed obedience.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace**
 - Framework that explains Christ as federal head: his obedience fulfills covenantal demands and secures covenant blessings.
- **Penal substitution**
 - Christ endures the penalty due to sinners; Murray places this within the broader double-obedience account.
- **Forensic / forensic character**
 - Emphasis on legal declaration and imputation (as distinct from intrinsic sanctification).
- **Righteousness (alien vs. inherent)**
 - Alien righteousness = the obedience of Christ imputed; inherent righteousness = sanctification within the believer.
- **Satisfaction / merit**
 - Satisfaction refers to Christ's fulfilling God's justice; Murray carefully distinguishes merit language from works-righteousness.
- **Representative headship**
 - Christ acts as covenantal representative whose obedience counts for those he represents.
- **Exemplary theory (contrasted)**
 - The view that Christ's obedience is only an example; Murray rejects this as insufficient for justification.
- **Double imputation**
 - Twofold exchange central to justification: sin imputed to Christ; righteousness imputed to believer.
- **Law-fulfillment**
 - The notion that Christ fulfilled the law's demands in full, satisfying both active requirements and passive penalty.
- **Forensic assurance**
 - Assurance grounded in the declared righteousness afforded by Christ's imputed obedience.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the classical Reformed doctrine of active and passive obedience.
- As a **polemic tool** against moral-influence, purely participatory, or passive-only accounts of atonement and justification.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline texts on imputation and righteousness; a conceptual pivot in Reformed soteriological teaching.
