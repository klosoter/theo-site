### TITLE
Arguing About Gods - Graham Oppy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 21st-century work situated in analytic philosophy of religion; aimed at survey and critique of classic and contemporary arguments for theism within the Cambridge/analytic tradition rather than confessional theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Systematic analytic scrutiny shows that standard arguments for the existence of God (classical and modern) fail to provide warrant; atheism or agnosticism is a philosophically defensible posture because theistic hypotheses lack the evidential/probabilistic support required.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Part 1: Taxonomy of positions - clarifies what counts as "a god" and distinguishes theism, atheism, agnosticism, and varieties of theism (personal, impersonal, maximal God).
 - Part 2: Methodology - articulates standards for argument evaluation (burden of proof, evidential standards, probabilistic/confirmation-theoretic considerations).
 - Part 3: Critical assessments - systematic critique of major argument families:
 - Ontological arguments (modal/Anselmian moves and their formal weaknesses).
 - Cosmological arguments (contingency, causal regress, Kalam).
 - Teleological and fine-tuning arguments (explanatory power vs. chance, multiverse responses).
 - Moral and religious-experience arguments (normativity, epistemic warrant).
 - Part 4: Responses and replies - evaluates contemporary defenders (Swinburne, Plantinga, Craig) and examines whether cumulative or "best explanation" approaches succeed.
 - Conclusion: None of the traditional or modern arguments deliver adequate warrant; philosophical theism remains unsupported by the evidence as structured.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged:** Anselm, Aquinas, Hume, Paley, Leibniz, Kant; modern analytic interlocutors such as Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, William Lane Craig, and proponents of fine-tuning arguments.
- **Doctrines treated:** Primarily **divine existence** and **divine attributes** (omnipotence, omniscience, maximal greatness) insofar as they enter into arguments for existence; secondary engagement with miracles, religious experience, and moral justification. Minimal treatment of specifically Christian doctrinal loci (Trinity, Christology, revelation as dogma).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Oppy presents a methodologically strict, evidence-sensitive stance: having dismantled standard proofs, he concludes that belief in God is not philosophically mandated by argument - the burden of proof rests on theism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous argumentative taxonomy: careful parsing of argument-schemes rather than rhetorical summary.
 - Emphasis on **probabilistic and evidential standards** over rhetorical or fideistic defenses.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:**
 - Challenges Plantinga's claims about warrant and properly basic belief by insisting on more stringent evidentialist demands.
 - Critiques Swinburne's cumulative case and Craig's Kalam by exposing gaps in premises and unstated probabilistic assumptions.
 - Re-reads Humean skepticism in a modern confirmation-theoretic register to press weaknesses in design and miracle arguments.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic use of confirmation theory and prior-probability reasoning applied to the God-hypothesis.
 - Careful distinctions among conceptions of deity (e.g., maximal God vs. simple god hypotheses) to show varying evidential burdens.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of religion and used as a standard critical survey in undergraduate/graduate teaching.
 - Popular among secular and skeptical readers; viewed warily by many confessional apologists but respected for methodological clarity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model for analytic critique: exemplary training in dissecting argument-structure, assessing premises, and weighing evidential force.
 - Useful as a clearing-house of contemporary objections a theist must address.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theism / Atheism / Agnosticism:** Clear operational definitions used to frame argumentative targets.
- **God-hypothesis:** Generic term for candidate explanations invoking a deity; Oppy stresses precise specification (attributes, scope) affects evidential assessment.
- **Ontological argument:** Formal/modal arguments; Oppy exposes equivocations and modal-principle dependencies.
- **Cosmological arguments:** Contingency appeals and causal-regress claims; Oppy targets hidden metaphysical assumptions (well-foundedness, necessity of a first cause).
- **Teleological / Fine-tuning arguments:** Claims from order/design; Oppy emphasizes alternative explanations (chance, multiverse, natural law) and issues with probabilistic comparisons.
- **Moral argument:** Claims from moral normativity; Oppy probes is-ought gaps and whether God adds explanatory value beyond secular accounts.
- **Religious experience arguments:** Evaluated as evidence; Oppy demands public, corroborative standards and notes the problem of competing religious experiences.
- **Cumulative case / Inference to the Best Explanation:** Oppy examines whether aggregation of weak arguments yields warrant and finds the move often unsuccessful without independent priors.
- **Probabilistic confirmation / Bayesian-style reasoning:** Used as the methodological backbone for weighing arguments and priors.
- **Burden of proof / Evidential standards:** Central methodological insistence - claims require justification proportionate to their extraordinary nature.
- **Divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, maximal greatness):** Treated as definitional inputs that change argument outcomes and priors.
- **Prior probability:** Key concept in Oppy's critique - many god-hypotheses carry low priors, undermining argument success.
- **Naturalism vs Theism:** Background metaphysical alternatives used as comparative explanatory frameworks.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition and taxonomy source** for analytic treatments of "god" and argument-types.
 - As a **polemical resource** against classical and modern apologetics (summarizes objections apologists must meet).
 - As a **methodological/exegetical model** in philosophy of religion courses for training in argument analysis and evidential assessment.
