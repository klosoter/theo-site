### TITLE
**A Reasonable God: Engaging the New Face of Atheism** - Gregory E. Ganssle

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the context of the early 21st-century challenge of **New Atheism** (Richard Dawkins, Christopher Hitchens, Sam Harris) and renewed analytic philosophical debate about religion.
 - Situated within Christian apologetics informed by analytic philosophy and moral epistemology; aimed at both lay readers and students in theological/apologetic settings.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Theism, properly stated and defended, remains a **reasonable** response to the intellectual and moral critiques advanced by New Atheists; specifically, the problem of evil and charges of divine injustice do not suffice to render belief in God irrational.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: clarifies the New Atheist objections - rhetorical and evidential claims about evil, immorality of divine commands, and alleged incompatibility of suffering with a just, omnipotent God.
 - Analytical reconstruction: restates both **logical** and **evidential** formulations of the problem of evil in precise, philosophical terms.
 - Defensive moves:
 - Examines and defends **free will** and **greater-good** responses to moral and natural evil.
 - Assesses skeptical theism and its limits: argues for plausible epistemic constraints without falling into radical skepticism.
 - Reformulates burden-of-proof and standards of evidence, showing atheistic claims often overreach their epistemic warrant.
 - Constructive payoff: argues that theistic explanations (including eschatological justice and providential ordering) remain intellectually viable and morally plausible.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: **Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris** (New Atheists) and analytic philosophers of religion (e.g., William Rowe on evidential problem, J.L. Mackie on logical problem, Alvin Plantinga on free will defense).
 - Draws on classical theodical resources (Augustinian and Irenaean lines), contemporary analytic theodicy, and moral philosophy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theodicy** and **divine justice** (central)
 - Attributes of God: omnipotence, omniscience, goodness
 - **Providence**, human **freedom**, moral responsibility
 - Eschatological vindication as part of divine justice
 - Natural theology and the **moral argument**

- **Closing line**
 - The book's theological center of gravity: **belief in a just, powerful, and loving God remains a reasonable, intellectually responsible stance even in the face of powerful atheist critiques about evil and injustice.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **analytic clarity** and epistemic standards rather than rhetorical rebuttal; treats atheistic claims as philosophical theses requiring argument-level response.
 - Stresses the moral dimensions of the debate: theodicy is not merely metaphysical but centrally a question about **divine justice** and moral intelligibility.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond polemical evangelical apologetics by engaging New Atheists on their own analytic terms.
 - Balances between Plantinga-style defenses and skeptical theism: accepts limits on human epistemic access without abandoning robust theistic claim.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "**reasonable theism**" as a methodological posture: combining evidential modesty with rational confidence in core theistic commitments.
 - Frames divine justice in **eschatological and prudential** terms, integrating moral argumentation with soteriological hope.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-regarded in apologetic circles and used as a course or seminar text where students confront New Atheist literature.
 - Limited traction as a systematic theological text in Reformed scholasticism, but valued for methodological rigor and pedagogical clarity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a model of how to engage popular atheism without abandoning theological seriousness; useful for teaching theodicy, moral philosophy of religion, and apologetic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Atheism**
 - Contemporary popular anti-theistic movement (Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris) emphasizing science, rhetoric, and moral critique.
- **Reasonable Theism**
 - Methodological stance: belief in God defended by analytic argument and appropriate epistemic modesty.
- **Problem of Evil (logical)**
 - Claim that the existence of evil is logically incompatible with an omnipotent, omniscient, wholly good God.
- **Problem of Evil (evidential)**
 - Claim that the amount and kinds of evil make belief in God unlikely, even if not logically impossible.
- **Free Will Defense**
 - Theodical move that attributes moral evil to creaturely freedom and its necessary risks.
- **Greater-Good Theodicy**
 - Argument that certain evils are necessary for achieving higher goods (character formation, relations, moral law).
- **Skeptical Theism**
 - Epistemic stance: human cognitive limitations justify withholding expectations of knowing God's reasons for permitting some evils.
 - Ganssle accepts qualified skeptical-theist moves while guarding against global skepticism.
- **Divine Justice**
 - Concern for God's moral rectitude and ultimate vindication; treated both juridically and eschatologically.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance that orders events toward moral and eschatological ends.
- **Moral Argument**
 - Argument from moral facts to the existence of a moral lawgiver or God.
- **Burden of Proof**
 - Epistemic principle about which party must provide justification; Ganssle critiques atheists' shifting or excessive burdens.
- **Eschatological Vindication**
 - The view that ultimate justice and reasons for present suffering will be disclosed in the final state.
- **Analytic Apologetics**
 - Use of analytic-philosophical tools in defending religion; Ganssle's methodological home.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **polemic** and clarifying resource against New Atheist rhetorical strategies and philosophical claims.
 - As a **teaching model** for theodicy and the ethics of divine attributes in apologetics seminars and philosophy of religion courses.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating moral epistemology with classical theodical responses (useful for constructing balanced defenses rather than fideistic retreats).
