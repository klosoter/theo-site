### TITLE
Humanity of God - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 1920s post‑WWI theological milieu; emerges from Barth's break with 19th‑century liberal theology and his development of dialectical (neo‑orthodox) theology after the Romans commentary (1919). Short, polemical lectures/essay addressing Christology and theological anthropology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The decisive doctrine is that God is truly human in the person of Jesus Christ; authentic knowledge of humanity and of God occurs only in the event of God's self‑revelation in Christ. This confronts abstract metaphysical talk about God and speculative anthropologies (e.g., trichotomy).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scripture testifies that God enters human existence in Jesus; therefore, God's humanity is not an attribution by analogy but a concrete historical revelation.
 - God's humanity must be defended against two errors:
 - Reductive anthropomorphism (making God merely a heightened human).
 - Absolute transcendence that renders God unreachable (making divine humanity unintelligible).
 - Christology is primary for anthropology: human nature is known only in relation to the incarnate Word; the image of God is restored and disclosed in Christ.
 - Methodological move: theological claims must be anchored in the biblical witness and the event of revelation, not in autonomous philosophical speculation about soul/spirit distinctions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit critique of liberal theologians (e.g., Schleiermacher's religious feeling), engagement with Neo‑Kantian and speculative anthropology, and with historical dogmatic formulations. Barth dialogues with biblical exegesis rather than systematic metaphysics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (center), revelation, incarnation, theological anthropology, doctrine of God (attributes reframed by revelation), soteriology implied (God's solidarity with humanity).
- **Closing line:** Barth frames theology around the paradoxical but scriptural claim that God is known only where God has become human in Christ - theology is thus obedient witness to the revelation-event rather than speculative deduction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - God's humanity is an event (revelatory, historical) not an abstract property; theology must begin with the incarnation.
 - Strong stress on the primacy of the Word‑event: the "humanity of God" is the locus of divine self‑disclosure.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects liberalism's inward, subjectivist criteria for religion by insisting on objective revelation in history.
 - Opposes metaphysical approaches that either depersonalize God or reduce God to human projection.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reinforces Barthian categories later articulated as analogia relationis (the relational, asymmetrical character of divine‑human correspondence grounded in revelation).
 - Recasts theological anthropology around Christic disclosure rather than speculative parts (body/soul/spirit).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in shaping 20th‑century neo‑orthodoxy and Christocentric theological method.
 - Provoked critique from both liberal theologians (for rejecting subjective religious experience) and from some conservative scholastics (for methodological discontinuity with classical metaphysics).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes contemporary reflection on how Christology grounds anthropology and how revelation constrains philosophical categories.
 - Serves as a corrective to theologies that separate systematic metaphysics from biblical testimony.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation:** The decisive event enabling God's humanity; Barth treats it as the epistemic and existential center.
- **Revelation (Erfahrung des Wortes):** God's self‑disclosure in Christ; knowledge of God and humanity is revelation‑bound.
- **Christology:** The primary locus for doctrine; Christ unites divine and human realities for theological reflection.
- **Analogia relationis:** Implicit methodological principle-relation between God and human is established by God's act, not pre‑given similarity.
- **Theological anthropology:** Reoriented to depend on Christ as the image and disclosure of true humanity.
- **Anthropomorphism (critique):** Warning against projecting human categories onto God without the corrective of revelation.
- **Transcendence vs immanence:** Barth reframes the tension by insisting that divine immanence (God's becoming human) occurs without loss of divine otherness.
- **Paradox/dialectic:** Use of paradox to hold together opposites (wholly other God who is nonetheless human in Christ).
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy:** Barth is critical of speculative trichotomous schemes; he resists abstract partitioning of human nature and insists biblical anthropology is ordered around the revelation of the incarnate Word. His emphasis subordinates such metaphysical splits to the Christological witness.
- **Event language:** Theology as response to the divine event rather than systematizing from first principles.
- **Kenosis (implicit):** Not a systematic use of kenosis doctrine, but Barth presupposes divine self‑emptying as the mode of revelation.
- **Scriptural primacy:** Scripture as the normative witness to the humanity of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christology and theological anthropology: centers subsequent debates on how Christ discloses human identity.
- As a **polemic** against liberal, speculative, and anthropomorphic theologies: used to justify a revelation‑first method.
- As an **exegetical model**: exemplifies reading biblical witness as primary data for dogmatic claims about God's relation to humanity.
