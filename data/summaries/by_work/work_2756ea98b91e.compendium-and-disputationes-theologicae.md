### TITLE
Compendium and Disputationes Theologicae (Institutio Theologiae Elencticae) - Francis Turretin (Franciscus Turretinus), Geneva, Reformed scholasticism, late 17th century (lectures 1660s-1680s; printed editions 1685 et seq.).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Geneva Academy, post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy confronting Arminianism, Socinianism, Roman Catholic scholasticism, and emergent rationalist pressures.
 - Scholastic-disputational pedagogy: loci arranged as disputations with quaestiones, probationes, and responses to objections.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend and systematize classical Reformed doctrine across loci, securing confessional orthodoxy while employing analytic precision to answer heterodox challenges.
 - Trinitarian aim: uphold consubstantial equality of the three Persons while accounting for relational distinctions and ordered operations.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organized by loci (Scripture, God, Trinity, decrees, creation, fall, Christ, redemption, application, church, sacraments, eschatology).
 - Each disputation:
 - Proposes a question and thesis,
 - Gives Scriptural and patristic foundations,
 - Outlines syllogistic proofs and replies to adversaries,
 - Distinguishes between immanent (ad intra) and economic (ad extra) aspects of God.
 - For the Trinity: careful distinction between ousia/essence and personae/relations; maintains eternal relations (paternity, filiation, procession) without admitting any inequality of essence or will.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Deep engagement with Augustine, Calvin, medieval scholastics, contemporary Reformed theologians, and opponents (Arminians, Socinians).
 - Frequent appeal to councils, creeds, and Scriptural exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, God and attributes, Trinity and persons, decrees, providence, human nature and sin, Christology and atonement, justification, sanctification, covenant theology, church, sacraments, last things.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's theological center of gravity: a rigorous, confessional defense of classical Reformed orthodoxy that insists on the unity of divine essence and the full equality of the Persons while carefully ordering their relations and works.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Methodical scholastic clarity: precise definitions, distinctions, and syllogistic proofs for pastoral and polemical use.
 - Strong insistence on the ontological equality of the Trinity while allowing ordered missions and roles in redemption.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects perceived ambiguities in some later Calvinist writings by refusing any language that implies inferiority of the Son in essence, will, or knowledge.
 - Polemically opposes Socinian denials of eternal relations and Arminian undermining of divine decrees.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Sharp operational partitioning of ad intra/ad extra and of order of origin (ordo originis) versus order of operation (ordo operationum), used to guard against conflation of relation and inequality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical textbook in Reformed seminaries, formative for Princeton and later conservative Reformed traditions; widely cited in Anglican and Presbyterian contexts.
 - Continues to be invoked in modern debates as a classic statement of scholastic Reformed Trinitarianism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Exemplifies how to do disciplined, confessional theology: precise categories, sustained exegetical underpinning, and practical polemic. Valuable for adjudicating contemporary Trinitarian controversies, including EFS debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity / Triune God** - unity of one divine essence in three distinct persons; foundational locus.
- **Essence (ousia, substantia)** - what God is; identical for Father, Son, Spirit; denies any ontological inequality.
- **Person (persona, subsistentia, hypostasis)** - who God is in relational existence; distinctions are relational, not essential.
- **Relation (relatio)** - the property by which persons are distinguished (paternity, filiation, procession); real and eternal but not grounds for inequality.
- **Order of origin (ordo originis)** - eternal order (e.g., Father → Son [generation], Spirit → Father/Son [procession]); descriptive of relation, not inferiority.
- **Order of operations (ordo operationum / ad extra)** - economic missions and roles in creation/redemption; allows temporal subordination of the incarnate Son without eternal ontological subordination.
- **Eternal generation / procession** - classic formulations to account for intra-Trinitarian relations without implying difference of substance.
- **Immanent Trinity (ad intra)** - God as God in himself; priority of unity and equality emphasized.
- **Economic Trinity (ad extra)** - God as operative toward creation; accounts for mission, authority, and incarnational obedience.
- **Property (proprietas)** - attributes or operations proper to a person (e.g., begetting to Father, begottenness to Son) without dividing essence.
- **Ontological subordination** - denied: any claim that Son is lesser in being, will, or knowledge is rejected.
- **Economic subordination** - affirmed only as role in time (incarnation, mission); distinguished from eternal relations.
- **Will (voluntas) and operation (opus)** - Turretin insists divine wills and operations are not multiple in essence; distinctions are modal/relational, not ontic.
- **Hypostatic union** - used to explain the Son's temporal obedience and subordination in the incarnation without compromising eternal equality.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for classic Reformed formulations of Trinity, person, and relation.
 - As a **polemic resource** against claims of eternal ontological subordination (EFS) - supplies categories separating economic role from immanent equality.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading texts about Son's obedience and submission in their economic/ incarnational context.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in contemporary debate: deploy Turretin to insist that order and mission do not entail inequality of essence or will.
