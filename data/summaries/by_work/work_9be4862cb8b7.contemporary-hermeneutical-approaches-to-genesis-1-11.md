### TITLE
Contemporary Hermeneutical Approaches to Genesis 1-11 - Todd S. Beall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Situated in the late 20th / early 21st-century academic-theological conversation that wrestles with ancient Near Eastern (ANE) parallels, biblical theology, and modern scientific concerns. 
 - Engages the evangelical-academic milieu that seeks to balance a high view of Scripture with responsible historical-critical and literary methods.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Genesis 1-11 must be read with methods that respect ancient genre and worldview while preserving the text's canonical theological claims about God, creation, humanity, sin, and covenantal ordering. The work critiques both naïve literalism (concordism) and reductive demythologizing.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Exegetical foundation: close attention to Hebrew, narrative shape, and literary markers that distinguish primeval history from later parts of Genesis.
 - Contextualization: comparison with ANE creation and flood narratives to illuminate shared motifs and distinct theological contrasts.
 - Theological claim: Genesis functions as a theological-canonical prologue shaping Israelite identity and the Reader's theological imagination (creation, image-bearing, fall, divine ordering).
 - Methodological proposal: a hermeneutical pluralism that prioritizes genre, canonical function, intertextual reception (especially New Testament), and theological coherence over concordist demands.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - ANE studies and comparative literature (generic parallels with Enuma Elish, Atrahasis, etc.); biblical scholars such as John Walton (functional/temple reading), Nahum Sarna, Gerhard von Rad, and literary-canonical interpreters; critics from both young-earth and old-earth camps.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation (how Scripture communicates in ancient categories), Creation (ontology, function, order), Anthropology (image of God), Hamartiology (the Fall and its patterning), Covenant (seed/lineage and divine promises), Eschatological orientation (primeval promises as forward-looking).
- **Closing line:** 
 - Beall locates Genesis 1-11 at the intersection of ancient cosmology and canonical theology, urging hermeneutical humility and a method that defends the text's theological claims without imposing modern scientific categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on the text's *theological function* within the canon rather than treating primeval narratives as straightforward historical reportage or mere mythology.
 - Advocates a middle path often labeled methodological pluralism: genre-sensitive, historically informed, and doctrinally faithful.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects literalist/concordist readings that force modern scientific categories into the text.
 - Counters radical demythologizers who reduce Genesis to purely symbolic or secondary myth by reclaiming its theological claims about God, humanity, and order.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Refines the concept of "primeval history" as a distinct literary-canonical unit with its own rhetorical-theological aims.
 - Emphasizes "function over material ontology" in some readings (in conversation with functional creation views) while retaining substantive claims about divine agency.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Appreciated in seminary pedagogy and in ecumenical academic settings for balance; influential as a corrective in Reformed and conservative circles open to non-concordist readings.
 - Less persuasive to strict young-earth advocates; used by moderate evangelicals as a working synthesis.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a clear roadmap of methodological options and their theological consequences; valuable for training students to read ANE-influenced texts without capitulating to modern scientism or relativism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Primeval history:** the opening block (Gen 1-11) treated as a discrete literary-theological unit.
- **Genre sensitivity:** attention to ancient narrative forms, mythic motifs, and what they permit the reader to assert.
- **Canonical function:** how Genesis 1-11 operates within the larger biblical canon to shape Israelite and Christian identity.
- **ANE parallels:** comparative materials (e.g., Enuma Elish, Atrahasis) used to clarify common motifs and distinctive Israelite theology.
- **Concordism:** the attempt to make biblical statements align directly with modern scientific descriptions; critiqued.
- **Functional ontology:** reading creation texts in terms of purpose and function rather than modern material ontology (in dialogue with Walton).
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** anthropological centerpiece-used to ground dignity, vocation, and relationality.
- **Fall and culpability:** hermeneutical handling of sin that balances narrative causality and theological universality.
- **Genealogical-structuring:** the role of genealogies as theological bridges linking primeval promises to patriarchal narratives.
- **Intertextual reception:** New Testament and later canonical use as a hermeneutical check on meaning and application.
- **Theological-historical humility:** posture urging restraint in drawing modern scientific inferences from ancient cosmology.
- **Hermeneutical pluralism:** methodological stance permitting multiple complementary approaches (literary, historical, theological).
- **Typology and promise:** reading primeval events as foreshadowing covenantal and messianic developments.
- **Exegesis vs. doctrine:** distinction modeling how close reading informs but does not mechanically determine dogmatic formulations.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for the category "primeval history" and for methodological taxonomy.
 - As a polemic against literalist-concordist readings and against reductive demythologizing.
 - As an exegetical model in seminary courses that integrates ANE context, literary form, and canonical theology.
 - As a conceptual pivot for discussions of creation theology, imago Dei, and the place of Genesis in systematic theology.
