### TITLE
The Reason of Faith - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 17th-century English Puritan/Reformed milieu; Owen (1616-1683) writing amid Restoration controversies and rising deism/skepticism. Pastoral-apologetic intent addressed to clergy and believing laity threatened by naturalistic objections to Christianity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christian faith is rationally grounded and warranted: Scripture and the Christian revelation possess sufficient and effectual reasons for belief - not simply external demonstrations but an inward, Spirit-wrought certitude - with revelation given by divine accommodation analogous to the incarnation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Articulates the limits of mere philosophical demonstration and the appropriate scope of human reason in matters of revealed religion.
 - Assembles historical and epistemic grounds for Christianity (miracles, prophecy, fulfilled promises, moral fruits).
 - Advances the doctrine of the Spirit's internal testimony: Scripture and the gospel are *self-attesting* insofar as God gives inward persuasion enabling faith.
 - Develops the notion of divine *accommodation*: God condescends in mode and language so finite creatures can receive revelation - a concept treated analogically to the incarnation.
 - Applies the combined epistemic picture to pastoral ends: assurance, church authority, and anti-skeptical practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Uses Augustinian and Calvinist resources; argues against contemporary sceptics, Socinians, and early deistic tendencies. Implicitly counters apologetic models that demand Cartesian or demonstrative certainty.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, authority of Scripture, Christology (incarnation as analogical paradigm), Holy Spirit (internal testimony), faith and reason, apologetics, assurance.
- **Closing line:** Owen centers the book on the claim that God's condescending revelation - accommodated to human capacity and certified by the inward testimony of the Spirit - provides sufficient, effectual reasons for Christian faith and assurance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong stress on the *internal testimony of the Spirit* as the decisive ground of belief rather than solely on extrinsic evidences.
 - Use of the *incarnational analogy* (revelation as divine condescension) to justify non-philosophical, anthropic modes of divine speech.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects strict rationalist/apriorist expectations that demand philosophical demonstration for religious assent.
 - Pushes back on facile fideism by insisting on *sufficient reasons* (historical and moral) alongside inward attestation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic pairing of *accommodation* (verbal/communicative condescension) with *self-attestation* (Scripture's inward certifying function).
 - Clearer delineation between *probative* external reasons and *effectual* internal certainty wrought by the Spirit.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed pastoral theology and apologetics; anticipated and informed later evangelical stress on inner assurance (e.g., elements in Edwardsian epistemology).
 - Cited in debates over Scripture's authority against rationalists and minimalists; read in Reformed seminaries for its combined pastoral and doctrinal rigor.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a robust model for integrating evidential apologetics with pneumatological assurance.
 - Valuable for teaching about the relation of natural reason to revealed truth and for contemporary responses to deism and secular skepticism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Accommodation:** God's condescending adjustment of revelation to human capacities; central to explaining plain language and anthropic imagery in Scripture.
 - Related: *incarnational analogy* - revelation as analogous to the Son's condescension in the incarnation.
- **Incarnational analogy:** Uses Christ's condescension as a model for how God communicates; justifies non-philosophical, culturally intelligible revelation.
- **Self-attestation (of Scripture):** The claim that Scripture, by the Spirit's inward testimony, bears its own authority and warrants faith.
- **Internal testimony / testimony of the Spirit:** The Spirit's immediate persuasive action which gives assurance and makes the external evidences effectual.
- **Sufficient reasons:** Owen's category for historical, prophetic, and moral grounds that render belief reasonable without demanding demonstrative proof.
- **External evidences:** Miracles, prophecy, fulfilled promises, historical reliability - acknowledged as necessary but not exclusively decisive.
- **Effectual persuasion vs. speculative demonstration:** Distinction between reasons that move the will and guarantee assurance versus abstract proofs that persuade intellect only.
- **Divine condescension / condescending speech:** Language theology term applied to how God adapts revelation to human finitude.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Grounded in God's truthfulness and the Spirit's ratifying witness rather than mere ecclesiastical fiat or natural reason alone.
- **Revelation (accommodated revelation):** Scripture as communicative act suited to human reception; not to be read as philosophically abstruse but relationally revelatory.
- **Faith and reason:** Interrelation: reason provides grounds; faith rests on these grounds plus the Spirit's inward confirmation.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral outworking of self-attestation - believers may attain certitude through the combined external-internal grounds.
- **Moral transformation:** The ethical fruit of the gospel is treated as a confirmatory sign of its truthfulness.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the doctrine of the authority of Scripture and the place of the Spirit in epistemology.
- As a **polemic** against deist/atheist demands for purely demonstrative proofs and against forms of rationalism that exclude pneumatological certitude.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on apologetics, Reformed epistemology, and the theology of revelation - especially where accommodation and internal testimony are in view.
