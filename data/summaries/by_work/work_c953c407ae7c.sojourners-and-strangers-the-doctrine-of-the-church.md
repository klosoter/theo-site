### TITLE
Sojourners and Strangers: The Doctrine of the Church - Gregg R. Allison

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary conservative evangelical / Protestant milieu (early 21st century). Written by a Baptist theologian addressing a broad evangelical audience concerned with church identity, mission, and order amid postmodernity, denominational fragmentation, and liturgical renewal debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church is the pilgrim, covenant people of God - both already and not-yet - constituted and sustained by Word and sacraments (ordinances), called to holiness, unity, and mission. The work seeks to define the church properly against Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, mainline, and sectarian distortions, with particular attention to Baptist distinctives.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of biblical foundations for the church (people of God, body of Christ, temple, bride).
 - Distinction between **universal** and **local** church; visible and invisible dimensions.
 - Doctrinal treatment of church offices (elders, deacons), membership, worship, sacraments/ordinances (baptism, Lord's Supper).
 - Ecclesial practices: discipline, mission/evangelism, church planting, unity and ecumenism.
 - Eschatological hope: church as sojourning community anticipating consummation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as primary; classical sources include Augustine, Calvin, B. B. Warfield; modern interlocutors from Roman Catholic, Orthodox, Lutheran, Reformed, Anabaptist, and charismatic traditions are surveyed and critiqued. Contemporary evangelical scholarship and pastoral concerns inform application.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology central, but treatment interfaces with covenant theology, sacraments, Christology (headship of Christ), pneumatology (Spirit and gifts), ecclesial office, ecclesial discipline, worship, mission, and eschatology.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The church is the covenant people of God - a pilgrim, mission-shaped, Word-governed community marked by faithful administration of the ordinances, disciplined holiness, and confident hope in Christ's return.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Baptist and evangelical emphasis:** Strong insistence on regenerate church membership and believer's baptism as normative; the ordinances are treated as symbolic / memorial with real spiritual benefit through Spirit-enabled faith rather than sacerdotal or physical change.
- **Pilgrim motif:** Uses the "sojourners and strangers" motif as an organizing theological image - the church is simultaneously a present community and an eschatological people on the way to consummation.
- **Balanced ecclesial vision:** Seeks a middle path between pietistic individualism and institutional sacramentalism: the local, gathered church matters, but its identity is rooted in covenantal regeneration and gospel proclamation.
- **Polity and office:** Advocates plurality of elders and congregational accountability - emphasizing biblical qualifications, elder oversight, and congregational participation in important decisions (reflects conservative Baptist practice tempered by pastoral concern).
- **Corrective moves:**
 - Against Roman Catholic/Orthodox sacramentalism and apostolic succession claims that displace the sufficiency of Word and Spirit.
 - Against sectarian individualism that neglects visible church marks, discipline, and creedal continuity.
 - Against utopian ecclesial models that ignore the church's pilgrim, missional vulnerability.
- **Reception and influence:** Used in evangelical seminaries and pastoral training as a contemporary, readable systematic treatment of ecclesiology from a Baptist-evangelical perspective; valued for pastoral clarity and for engaging ecumenical contrasts without polemical excess.
- **Enduring value:** Clear articulation tying ecclesiology to mission and holiness; accessible synthesis of doctrine and practice useful for pastors, students, and pastors-in-training.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church (ekklesia):** The covenant people called out by God; treated in universal and local dimensions.
- **Visible / Invisible Church:** Distinction maintained; visible church is the gathered, covenant community; invisible church is the elect known fully only to God.
- **Sojourners / Strangers:** Theological image emphasizing pilgrimage, holiness, and eschatological orientation.
- **Regenerate membership:** Membership predicated on a credible profession of faith; critical for baptism and Lord's Supper participation.
- **Baptism (believer's):** Regenerative-sign for professing believers; mode and recipients tied to Baptist convictions.
- **Lord's Supper:** Ordinance signifying Christ's death; memorial with spiritual benefit mediated by Spirit through faith (rejects transubstantiation).
- **Offices - Elders & Deacons:** Plural eldership with biblically defined qualifications; deacons as servants for ministry support.
- **Church discipline:** Necessary for purity and witness; includes corrective and restorative aims.
- **Worship:** Regulative principle emphasis (Word-centered), though with pastoral flexibility in forms.
- **Mission / Evangelism:** Central to church identity; the church is sent to bear witness and disciple nations.
- **Covenant:** Frames church membership and continuity with Israel while defending believer-church distinctives.
- **Marks of the true church:** Preaching of the Word, proper administration of ordinances, and exercise of discipline.
- **Eschatological hope:** Church anticipates consummation; current life shaped by future reality.
- **Ecumenism:** Critical engagement; affirms unity in essentials while defending necessary doctrinal boundaries.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a concise evangelical **definition source** for ecclesiology and Baptist polity.
 - As a **polemic and comparative** resource contrasting sacramentalist and sectarian errors.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** linking biblical exegesis to congregational practice and mission.
