### TITLE
**Moo, Douglas J. - "The New Perspective on Paul" (essay in Justification and Variegated Nomism, 2004)** 
Bibliographic anchor: contribution to a Festschrift/essay volume responding to Sandersian and post‑Sanders research; major intervention in contemporary debates over Pauline justification, forensic language, and the New Perspective on Paul (NPP).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century debate: reaction to E. P. Sanders' Covenantal Nomism and the rise of the New Perspective (Dunn, Wright).
 - Volume gathers critical responses; Moo writes as a conservative evangelical scholar defending traditional Reformation categories.
- **Central thesis**
 - Paul's doctrine of justification is fundamentally **forensic/declarative** and involves **imputation**, contra the NPP claim that Paul primarily rejects ethnic boundary‑markers rather than soteriological works‑righteousness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Linguistic and contextual analysis of Pauline vocabulary (dikaioo, dikaiosyne, pistis, ergon nomou).
 - Close readings of key loci (Romans, Galatians), showing that Paul addresses **soteriological self‑justification** rather than merely ethnic markers.
 - Assessment of Second Temple Judaism evidence advanced by Sanders and others; argues that even if covenantal nomism is descriptively accurate, Paul's polemic still targets works‑based confidence in salvation.
 - Methodological critique of NPP: warns against overreliance on sociological categories that displace classic legal/forensic readings.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (NPP proponents).
 - Allies and contrasts: Reformed interpreters who affirm imputation and forensic justification.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (central), imputation, union with Christ (operative), soteriology, covenantal language, law and works.
- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - Moo insists that Pauline justification is best understood as a forensic declaration grounded in Christ's righteousness imputed to believers; repudiating this undermines classical doctrines of grace and atonement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Insistence on restoring the forensic taxonomy as doctrinally and exegetically warranted; persistence that imputation language remains the most coherent fit for Pauline syntax and theology.
 - Careful balance of philology and theology: Moo refuses either pole of purely sociological reading (NPP) or unconstrained dogmatic imposition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Pushes back against the NPP claim that "works of the law" are primarily ethnic boundary markers; emphasizes occasions where Paul opposes law‑based confidence in salvation.
 - Rejects Wright's strong reading of covenantal language as supplanting forensic justification.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions between forensic/declarative justification and relational covenant membership without collapsing or caricaturing either side.
 - Refines how "imputation" functions semantically within Pauline argument (notably in Romans).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard evangelical critique of the NPP; widely cited in Reformed seminars and responses to Wright.
 - Influenced subsequent defenses of traditional imputation models and shaped seminary curricula countering sociological readings.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model of disciplined, exegetically grounded rebuttal of NPP; valuable for teaching Paul, justification, and method in contemporary theological disputes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - scholarly movement reinterpreting Paul in light of Second Temple Judaism (Sanders, Dunn, Wright); Moo critiques its implications for soteriology.
- **Justification** - for Moo, primarily **forensic/declarative** (God's declarative verdict), not merely relational re‑classification.
- **Forensic imputation** - the doctrine that Christ's righteousness is accounted to believers; Moo defends this as Pauline and theologically necessary.
- **Works of the Law** - contested term:
 - NPP: social/ethnic boundary practices (circumcision, food laws).
 - Moo: often includes **works‑righteousness** concerns (merit claims before God).
- **Dikaioo / Dikaiosyne** - Paul's justification language examined in legal/forensic contexts.
- **Pistis (faith / trust)** - active relational trust that grounds the forensic declaration; not merely covenantal loyalty.
- **Covenantal Nomism / Variegated Nomism** - Sanders' descriptive framework for Judaism; Moo engages its implications but denies it eliminates forensic readings.
- **Union with Christ** - functional in Moo's account: union undergirds imputation and justification.
- **Soteriological vs. Ethnic Reading** - analytic pair used to test Paul's targets.
- **Exegetical method** - historical‑grammatical philology balanced against sociological insights; Moo favors stronger grammatical‑contextual constraints.
- **Critiques (NPP Critiques)** - semantic/contextual arguments undermining NPP's reading of key Pauline texts.
- **Justification Forensic Imputation Npp Critiques** - tags summarizing Moo's central locus: defense of forensic imputation and systematic refutation of NPP shifts.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for forensic justification and imputation in contemporary debates.
- As a **polemic** and model critique against NPP proposals - frequently cited in evangelical and Reformed responses.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how lexical, contextual, and theological considerations cohere in interpreting Romans and Galatians.
