### TITLE
Jason S. DeRouchie, essay in Covenant and the People of God (eds. Jason Gile & Kenneth J. Turner) - concise research notes

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contribution to a mid‑21st century edited volume addressing covenant theology within evangelical and Reformed conversation.
 - Milieu: renewed interest in canonical/redemptive‑historical approaches, reaction to both dispensational fragmentation and simplistic supersessionism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The covenantal identity of God's people is biblically continuous: Israel and the church are related as successive historical manifestations of **one covenant people**, with promises progressively fulfilled in Christ.
 - Problem addressed: how to honor biblical particularity (Israel, land, seed, Davidic promises) while maintaining the unity of God's redemptive plan without collapsing into either wholesale replacement or rigid separation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological framing: canonical and redemptive‑historical exegesis grounded in careful OT context, then traced into NT fulfilment.
 - Major moves:
 - Demonstrates centrality of covenant language and promise structure (Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) in forming Israel's identity.
 - Shows Christ as the climactic **fulfillment** (seed, king, covenant‑maker) whose life, death, and resurrection realize covenant promises.
 - Articulates continuity of covenant signs and institutions (circumcision → baptism; land/temple → eschatological promised reality) while acknowledging typological and functional shifts.
 - Defends a corporate, covenantal ecclesiology: the church is the people of God insofar as it partakes in the promises fulfilled in Christ, yet Israel retains historical particularity within salvation history.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed and redemptive‑historical voices: Geerhardus Vos, O. Palmer Robertson, Meredith Kline, John Murray.
 - Dialogues with contemporary critics: dispensationalists, some progressive covenantalists, and proponents of radical supersessionism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works/grace distinction, covenant of grace development)
 - Ecclesiology (people of God, continuity/discontinuity)
 - Christology (fulfillment of covenantal expectations)
 - Sacramental theology (signs and their continuity)
 - Soteriology and election (corporate and covenantal dimensions)
 - Eschatology (promise‑fulfillment and future consummation)

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: biblical covenants form a single, unfolding covenantal economy in which Christ consummates Israel's promises, producing one covenant people manifested historically as Israel and the church without reduction of biblical particularity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **typology as exegetical discipline** (not mere allegory): OT persons/events are historically real anticipations whose meaning is fixed in Christ.
 - Balances corporate continuity with careful attention to **particular promises** (e.g., land and dynasty) so they are neither dismissed nor naively literalized.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects oversimplified supersessionism by recovering Israel's covenantal role in salvation history.
 - Challenges dispensational compartmentalization by arguing for organic covenantal continuity and canonical fulfillment in Christ.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced framing of "one covenant people" that preserves both **unity** (single covenantal trajectory) and **distinction** (historical roles of Israel and the church).
 - Emphasizes covenant signs' ** typological transfer** rather than direct equivalence (circumcision → baptism as typological sign, not identical rite).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminary classrooms as an exegetical model for covenant continuity.
 - Cited in debates on ecclesiology, sacramental theology, and Israel‑church relations as a clarifying middle path.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a pedagogically clear, exegetically responsible bridge between OT particularity and NT catholicity-useful for preaching, teaching, and further research into covenantal hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - progressive unfolding across Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, and New Covenant stages; Christ as mediator and fulfillment.
- **People of God** - corporate identity shaped by covenant promises; historically instantiated in Israel and then in the church as people who are in Christ.
- **Typology** - disciplined hermeneutic: historical prefigurations attain fulfilled meaning in Christ.
- **Promise‑Fulfillment** - hermeneutical axis: promises (seed, land, dynasty) find telos in Christ and the eschaton.
- **Circumcision → Baptism** - typological relation between sign and signified; continuity of covenant sign function, not identical form.
- **Israel/Church distinction** - maintained as historical and redemptive categories within one covenantal economy.
- **Supersessionism (qualified critique)** - rejects crude replacement while affirming normative fulfillment of Israel's promises in Christ.
- **Federal Headship** - covenantal representation (Adam, Christ) remains key to understanding covenant structure and corporate responsibility.
- **Redemptive‑Historical Exegesis** - canonical reading that traces covenantal progression from promise to fulfillment.
- **Davidic Covenant** - pivotal instance of royal promise fulfilled in Christ's kingly office and mediatorial reign.
- **Land and Eschatology** - land promises reinterpreted typologically toward cosmic/eschatological consummation in Christ.
- **Corporate Election** - election expressed in covenant membership and peoplehood rather than purely individualistic categories.
- **New Covenant** - climactic covenant that secures internalizing of law, forgiveness, and true peoplehood in Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a balanced covenantal continuity (useful in systematic theology and ecclesiology).
 - As a **polemic** resource against both dispensational fragmentation and reductionist supersessionism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for OT→NT fulfillment studies and for teaching typology and covenant signs in homiletics and sacramental theology.
