### TITLE
Theology of the Major Sects - John Gerstner (focus: **Total Depravity** & **Total Inability**)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed evangelical milieu; Gerstner writes as a conservative Presbyterian theologian reacting to liberal theology, revivalist softening of sin, and Arminian/Methodist emphases on human ability. Work functions as both survey and polemic within confessional Protestant circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Classical Reformed doctrine affirms that human nature is radically corrupted by sin so that apart from sovereign grace humans are both morally and spiritually incapable of seeking God. Gerstner insists on maintaining the doctrinal pair **Total Depravity** (extent of corruption) and **Total Inability** (absence of salvific ability).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Define terms historically (Augustine, Calvin) and scripturally (Pauline corpus: Romans, Ephesians).
 - Distinguish **depravity** (corruption of nature/will) from **guilt** (legal culpability) and from supernatural consequences (eternal death).
 - Argue that **inability** is not mere lack of opportunity or secondary impediment but essential incapacity to do saving good without divine regeneration.
 - Contrast with Arminian/moderate views that affirm a residual natural ability or prevenient grace sufficient to cooperate with the gospel.
 - Conclude with pastoral and doctrinal implications: need for sovereign, efficacious grace; warning against moralistic or synergistic evangelism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical: Augustine, Calvin, the Westminster Divines.
 - Opponents: Jacob Arminius, Wesleyan/Methodist theologians, Roman Catholic Thomists (in relative contrast).
 - Scriptural anchors: Romans (esp. 3, 5, 7), Ephesians 2, John 6.
- **Doctrines treated:** anthropology (original sin, federal headship), soteriology (regeneration, justification, effectual calling), grace (common vs. saving), will (bondage), and pastoral implications for evangelism.
- **Closing line:** Gerstner presses that faithful gospel proclamation rests on the sober conviction that only sovereign, converting grace can overcome total human inability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sharp lexical separation between "depravity" (qualitative corruption) and "inability" (operative incapacity); insists both must be affirmed to avoid moralism.
 - Emphasis on the existential realities of bondage of the will rather than mere scholastic categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects theological softening that relativizes depravity into mere "tendency" or "inclination."
 - Pushes back against Arminian appeals to a natural, God-given ability to choose salvation; treats prevenient grace as insufficient without effectual calling.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies the contemporary pastoral import of classical formulations-translating confessional language into arguments usable in modern evangelistic contexts.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian teaching; used in seminary courses on systematic theology and missions strategy.
 - Criticized by Arminian and some ecumenical circles as overly determinative and insufficiently sensitive to human responsibility language.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, historically rooted defense of core Reformed convictions on human sin and grace; useful as a compact reference and polemical resource.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity:** The doctrine that sin has corrupted every part of human nature so that unaided persons are morally and spiritually incapable of seeking God.
- **Total Inability:** The inability of the unregenerate to perform savingly good acts or to respond to God without prior sovereign regeneration.
- **Bondage of the Will:** The classical formulation (Augustine/Calvin) describing the will bound by sin until liberated by divine grace.
- **Original Sin / Federal Headship:** Adam's sin imputed to his posterity, producing guilt and a corrupted nature.
- **Regeneration (New Birth):** The sovereign act by which God imparts new spiritual life and ability to repent and believe.
- **Effectual / Irresistible Grace:** God's efficacious call that actually converts the elect - linked to overcoming total inability.
- **Prevenient Grace:** The notion (often Arminian) of enabling grace that precedes and makes possible human cooperation; Gerstner critiques this as insufficient for salvation.
- **Common Grace vs. Saving Grace:** Distinction between God's restraining, beneficent work in the world and the particular, converting power that overcomes inability.
- **Moral Ability vs. Natural Ability:** Moral ability pertains to willing what is right; natural ability denotes mere physical or cognitive capability-Gerstner stresses loss of moral ability.
- **Radical Corruption:** Phrase underscoring the depth of sin's effects (heart, will, affections).
- **Imputed Guilt and Corruption:** Legal and ontological consequences of Adam's fall as grounds for need of grace.
- **Sovereignty of God in Salvation:** God's unilateral initiative as necessary to overcome human inability.
- **Responsibility Paradox:** Gerstner acknowledges human culpability while denying unaided capacity for saving good; he maintains both without resolving compatibilist tensions away from classical Reformed solutions.
- **Exegesis of Romans/Ephesians:** These Pauline texts function as primary scriptural proof texts for depravity/inability in the work.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed statements on depravity and inability.
- As a **polemic** against Arminian, semi-Pelagian, and therapeutic-evangelical distortions.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans/Ephesians on human sin and divine grace.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in syllabi on soteriology and pastoral evangelism emphasizing the necessity of effectual grace.
