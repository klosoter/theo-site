### TITLE
**Sinclair B. Ferguson - "Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior" (contributor; ed. Stephen Wellum)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed-evangelical context; published as part of a multi-author volume defending the exclusivity of Christ amid rising religious pluralism, inclusivist trends, and ecumenical pressures.
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and evangelicals seeking a biblically robust response to contemporary challenges to Christ's uniqueness.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus Christ is uniquely and exclusively the Savior of sinners; this uniqueness is rooted in his role as the covenantal and federal head who accomplishes redemption in the economy of the Triune God.
 - The problem addressed: how to maintain biblical exclusivity of salvation without collapsing into abstract voluntarism, speculative metaphysics, or uncharitable polemics.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Christ's mediatorial work is presented as the fulfillment of covenant promises and types across Scripture.
 - Theological construction: grounds Christ's uniqueness in the **Pactum Salutis** (covenant of redemption) and his federal headship - the one who represents, obeys, suffers, and secures salvation for his people.
 - Pastoral and apologetic application: outlines implications for evangelism, interreligious dialogue, and the church's self-understanding.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on classic Reformed writers (e.g., John Owen, Calvin, Vos) and contemporary covenant theologians; engages modern proposals of inclusivism and pluralism rather than primarily engaging liberal theology.
 - Interacts with biblical exegesis and systematic frameworks rather than with social-scientific or purely philosophical critiques.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (uniqueness, incarnation, mediatorial offices)
 - Covenant theology (Pactum Salutis; federal headship)
 - Soteriology (substitutionary atonement, imputation, union with Christ)
 - Trinitarian economy (roles of the Father, Son, Spirit in redemption)
 - Ecclesiology and mission (pastoral consequences)

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson locates Christ's exclusivity squarely in covenantal, Trinitarian, and incarnational realities: Christ is the one federal head through whom God accomplishes the salvation of his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that Christ's uniqueness is not merely ethical or exemplary but covenantal and representative - the historical persons and events accomplish what generic "divine love" cannot.
 - Balanced attention to both doctrinal precision (Pactum Salutis, imputation) and pastoral charity in dialoguing with non-Christian thought.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against inclusivist models that attenuate the particularity of Christ by positing anonymous Christian salvation outside explicit union with Christ.
 - Corrects pietistic or moralistic readings of Christ that minimize federal and forensic dimensions of redemption.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Rearticulates classical federal language in accessible pastoral categories: headship, representation, and covenantal solidarity are linked to everyday pastoral concerns (assurance, preaching, mission).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, pastoral defense of exclusivity; cited in debates over mission, pluralism, and public theology.
 - Serves as a go-to articulator for pastors and teachers seeking a succinct covenantal defense against pluralistic tendencies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Endures as a compact, doctrinally cohesive resource that connects historical Reformed insights (Pactum Salutis, federal headship) with contemporary apologetic needs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption)**
 - The intra-Trinitarian agreement in which the Father appoints the Son as Mediator to accomplish redemption for the elect.
 - Used to ground Christ's mediatorial work in Trinitarian intentionality and covenantal solidarity.

- **Christ as Covenant Head / Federal Headship**
 - Christ represents and secures corporate salvation for those given to him; his obedience and suffering count for his people.
 - Contrasts with individualistic or purely moral influence models of salvation.

- **Mediatorial Office**
 - Christ's unique roles as Prophet, Priest, and King in effecting salvation; emphatically mediatorial, not interchangeable with other religious figures.

- **Uniqueness / Exclusivity of Christ**
 - The claim that salvation is accomplished only in and through Jesus Christ; not merely a matter of divine benevolence accessible apart from union with Christ.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The existential and forensic bond by which believers are included in Christ's death, resurrection, and righteousness; central for assurance and application of atonement.

- **Substitutionary Atonement**
 - Christ suffers and dies as the substitute of his people, bearing divine wrath and securing reconciliation.

- **Imputation**
 - The crediting of Christ's righteousness to believers and believers' sin to Christ in his penal suffering; theological mechanism linking headship to justification.

- **Trinitarian Economy**
 - The ordered roles of Father, Son, and Spirit in choosing, accomplishing, and applying redemption; used to prevent modalistic or unilateral portrayals of salvation.

- **Typology / Covenant Fulfillment**
 - Old Testament types and covenants culminate in Christ, whose person and work fulfill promises and shadows.

- **Particularity vs. Universalism**
 - Emphasizes particular redemption accomplished for the elect as scripturally coherent; used polemically against universalist readings.

- **Representation vs. Exemplarity**
 - Representation (federal headship) prioritized over mere example as the basis for believers' standing before God.

- **Doctrine of Election (as contextual)**
 - While not always systematized, election functions in Ferguson's framework as the background of covenantal promises and the certainty of Christ's saving intent.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definition source and pastoral exposition of **Pactum Salutis** and covenantal headship.
- As a polemic against pluralism/inclusivism in apologetics and public theology.
- As an exegetical-systematic model linking Christology to soteriology and ecclesial mission.
