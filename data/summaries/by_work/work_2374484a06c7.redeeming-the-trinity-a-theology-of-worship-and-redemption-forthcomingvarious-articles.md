### TITLE
Redeeming the Trinity: A Theology of Worship and Redemption (forthcoming / collected articles) 
Author: Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical scholarship (late 20th-21st century). Poythress writes at the intersection of analytic theology, classical Reformed covenantalism, and biblical exegesis. The material collects essays and developed lectures aimed at bridging doctrinal theology and practical worship theology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Worship and redemption must be understood as two sides of the same Trinitarian reality: God redeems in and through the internal relations of the Trinity (notably the Covenant of Redemption), and true worship is participation in the intra-Trinitarian life that redemption establishes and exhibits.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Exegetical groundwork: close readings of key Trinitarian and worship texts (e.g., OT liturgy reinterpreted in light of Christ and Spirit; NT christological doxologies). 
 - Theological framing: articulation of a Covenant of Redemption (ad intra) that orders the persons' roles ad extra in salvation history. 
 - Christology and mediation: Christ's mediatorial obedience and suffering as the execution of the intra-Trinitarian pact; emphasis on both substitutionary atonement and covenantal fidelity. 
 - Pneumatology and application: the Spirit as agent who realizes and communicates the fruits of redemption to the church in worship and sanctification. 
 - Ecclesiology and liturgy: worship practices (Word, sacraments, doxology) as forms of participation in the Trinitarian communion and as the means of progressively conforming the church to Christ. 
 - Practical implications: reorientation of preaching, sacraments, and singing to display and enact the Trinitarian economy of redemption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Classical Reformed sources (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodox covenant theologians), contemporary Reformed thinkers (John Frame, others), and critical engagement with modern worship movements and some strands of Barthian and ecumenical trinitarianism.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Trinity, Covenant (notably Covenant of Redemption), Christology, Pneumatology, Soteriology, Ecclesiology, Sacramental theology, Revelation, Worship (liturgics/doxology).**

- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 - The Trinity is both the source and goal of salvation; redemption is an intra-Trinitarian act made manifest in Christ and applied by the Spirit, and Christian worship is the church's participatory response that embodies and advances that redemptive communion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong, systematic linking of **Covenant of Redemption** (intra-Trinitarian pact) to concrete worship practices-worship is cast not merely as response but as ontological participation in the Trinitarian economy. 
 - Integration of analytic clarity with reverent doctrinal retrieval: clear conceptual distinctions (ad intra/ad extra, person/role) allied to pastoral liturgical application.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects pietistic or pragmatist worship models that divorce soteriology from doxology; critiques approaches that treat worship primarily as human-centered experience. 
 - Offers an alternative to less personalist or overly metaphorical treatments of intra-Trinitarian relations by insisting on concrete covenantal roles and promises.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Re-articulation of covenantal vocabulary (e.g., Covenant of Redemption) as a central theological hinge connecting Trinitarian ontology and liturgical practice; emphasis on "participatory worship" as theological-ontological participation rather than mere moral imitation.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely read in conservative Reformed and confessional circles as a resource for rethinking worship theologically; influential among those seeking a robust Trinitarian foundation for liturgy and sacramental practice. Some critique for speculative intratrinitarian claims or for reconstructing ancient categories in modern analytic terms.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating doctrine and practice; valuable for courses on worship, systematic theology, and covenant theology; stimulates careful attention to how doctrine shapes liturgy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Redemption** 
 - Pretemporal/intra-Trinitarian agreement by which Father, Son, and Spirit order the plan and roles of redemption; central pivot connecting Trinity and soterial action.
- **Trinity (ad intra / ad extra)** 
 - Distinction between internal relations of the persons (ad intra) and the persons' missions in history (ad extra).
- **Mediatorial work / mediation** 
 - Christ's role as the one who accomplishes redemption according to the intra-Trinitarian covenant.
- **Pneumatological application** 
 - The Spirit's role in applying Christ's redeeming work to believers (regeneration, sanctification, illumination).
- **Participatory worship** 
 - Worship understood as real participation in the life and communion of the Triune God, not merely human response.
- **Doxology as ontology** 
 - The claim that doxological acts reveal and constitute aspects of Christian identity; praise discloses who God is and who we are in him.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** 
 - The relational unity of the persons that grounds cooperative action in redemption and exemplifies ecclesial communion.
- **Covenantal ordering** 
 - The structuring principle by which roles, promises, and sacraments are arranged within the economy of salvation.
- **Sacraments as signs and seals** 
 - Instruments by which the covenantal promises are both exhibited and effectually applied.
- **Hypostatic union (Christology)** 
 - Affirmation that Christ's divine-human union is central to his efficacy as mediator under the covenant.
- **Worship liturgy (Word and sacrament)** 
 - Practical loci where Trinitarian redemption is symbolized, proclaimed, and received.
- **Glory (doxological telos)** 
 - The final end of redemption: the glorification of God and the participation of redeemed creatures in divine glory.
- **Ecclesial formation** 
 - The shaping of corporate identity through worship that mirrors Trinitarian life.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the Covenant of Redemption and for framing ad intra/ad extra distinctions in worship theology. 
- As a **polemic** against worship models that minimize doctrinal substance in favor of experience or consumer-driven practice. 
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading biblical worship texts through a Trinitarian-covenantal lens and for shaping liturgical theology. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic Trinitarian theology to sacramental and pastoral praxis.
