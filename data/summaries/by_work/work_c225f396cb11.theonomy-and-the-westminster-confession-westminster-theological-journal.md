### TITLE
**Theonomy and the Westminster Confession - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed debate over theonomy and Christian social ethics, set against the rise of Christian Reconstructionism (Rushdoony, Bahnsen) and renewed interest in Meredith Kline's covenant theology.
 - Addressed to an audience committed to the Westminster Confession as a normative Reformed summary; published in an academic confessional journal engaging both scholarly and ecclesial concerns.

- **Central thesis**
 - Theonomy, as the view that Mosaic civil sanctions should be binding for contemporary civil society, rests on misreadings of the Westminster Confession and of Reformed covenant theology. The Confession does not authorize uncritical transfer of Old Testament civil penalties to modern magistrates.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical reading of WCF and related confessional standards to trace how they treat the law:
 - Distinguishes moral, ceremonial, and civil aspects of the Mosaic law as handled in the Confession.
 - Reconstructs WCF teaching on law's **uses** (especially as to binding moral content vs. administrative/civil sanctions).
 - Doctrinal analysis of covenants:
 - Clarifies the relation of the covenant of works and the covenant of grace to law and sanctification.
 - Locates good works as fruits and evidences of covenantal faith (engages the topic Good Works And Merit In The Covenant Of Grace).
 - Interaction with Klinean and theonomic claims:
 - Critically assesses Meredith Kline's covenant-structural emphases and the related notion of "intrusion ethics" (see Klinean Covenant Theology And Intrusion Ethics).
 - Argues that Klinean intrusion language can be overstretched to justify theonomy; confessional boundaries constrain such extrapolation.
 - Practical-political implications:
 - Considers the office of the civil magistrate and what, according to WCF, it may rightly require and punish.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Bahnsen, Rushdoony (theonomy / Reconstructionism), Meredith Kline (covenant structure, intrusion ethics).
 - Primary texts: Westminster Confession and catechisms, Scripture, classical Reformed divines.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works/grace), doctrine of law (moral/ceremonial/civil), soteriology (relation of works and merit), ecclesiology (church-state relation), political theology (magistrate), hermeneutics.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Poythress defends a confessional Reformed balance: the moral law remains normative, Christ mediates covenantal obligations, but the Westminster standards do not warrant transplanting Mosaic civil sanctions into modern polity without further warrant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Careful confessional hermeneutic: reads theonomy through the explicit categories and terminologies of the WCF rather than novel system-building.
 - Nuanced distinction between **merit** and **reward** in the covenant of grace: good works are non-meritorious for justification yet carry covenantal significance and promised recompense.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on theonomy's tendency to conflate moral law and Mosaic civil order; opposes simplistic Klinean leaps from covenantal typology to civil legislation.
 - Challenges Reconstructionist assumptions that the Confession provides implicit warrant for imposing Old Testament civil penalties.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates intrusion/inauguration language with confessional constraints, showing where "intrusion ethics" may be legitimate and where it overreaches.
 - Frames the WCF as a moderating lens that distinguishes **normative moral content** from **contingent civil prescriptions** tied to Israel's covenantal administration.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among conservative critics of theonomy; respected in confessional academic circles for methodical use of WCF categories.
 - Helped re-anchor debates in confessional theology rather than purely political or reconstructive rhetoric.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for courses and seminars on law and polity, especially for students needing a confessional corrective to theonomy and for clarifying the Reformed marriage of covenant theology with political ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theonomy**
 - Political program urging civil application of Mosaic law; Poythress critiques its confessional warrant.
- **Westminster Confession (WCF)**
 - Normative Reformed standard used as hermeneutical key to evaluate theonomy.
- **Moral law**
 - Eternal moral commands rooted in God's nature; affirmed as binding in conscience and civil spheres in general but distinguished from Israel's civil codes.
- **Ceremonial law**
 - Ritual statutes fulfilled in Christ; not binding as such for church or state after Christ.
- **Civil (judicial) law**
 - Israel-specific sanctions and governance structures; the locus of debate over contemporary applicability.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace**
 - Framework for understanding law and promise; central to Poythress's handling of merit and reward.
 - Sub-bullet: **Good Works and Merit in the Covenant of Grace** - Poythress stresses that good works do not merit justification but are covenantal evidences with promised rewards.
- **Merit vs. Reward**
 - Merit: earning justification (denied for believers); Reward: God's covenantal recompense for obedient service (affirmed in WCF terms).
- **Threefold use of the law**
 - Civil/moral uses elaborated with confessional nuance to prevent theonomy's conflation.
- **Intrusion ethics / Klinean covenant theology**
 - Kline's language of eschatological "intrusion" into history; Poythress accepts aspects but warns against using intrusion as carte blanche for imposing Israel's civil ordinances.
- **Civil magistrate**
 - Office evaluated against WCF teaching; magistrate's authority limited by Christ's mediatorial lordship and confessional categories.
- **Reconstructionism / Christian Reconstruction**
 - Movement Poythress critiques where it departs from confessional constraints.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source**: clarifies what the WCF actually says about law, covenant, and magistrates.
 - As a **polemic**: targeted critique of theonomy and of overconfident extensions of Klinean categories.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: example of reading confessional texts to adjudicate contemporary ethical-political claims.
