### TITLE
**Jesus and the God of Israel: God Crucified and Other Studies on the New Testament's Christology of Divine Identity** - Richard Bauckham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century scholarship (collected essays spanning c.1990s-2000s). Situated within renewed interest in early Christian high Christology, response to social-scientific and historical-critical trends that separated early Christology from Jewish monotheism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament explicitly identifies Jesus with the God of Israel; therefore Christian worship of Jesus is not an abandonment of Jewish monotheism but its continuation and re-revelation. The crucified Jesus is the God of Israel - "God crucified" - a theological pivot that requires rethinking revelation, divine identity, and early Christian confession.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of NT texts (Gospels, Pauline letters, Revelation) showing direct ascription to Jesus of titles, actions, and functions properly belonging to YHWH.
 - Demonstrates that early Jewish monotheism allowed, or was reinterpreted to allow, the ascription of God's identity to a distinct person (Jesus) without polytheism.
 - Argues against models that explain high Christology solely as late Hellenistic influence or as mere exaltation; instead, interprets it as rooted in witness to Jesus' life, death, resurrection, and vindication.
 - Considers theological consequences: suffering God, vindication and enthronement, ongoing worship and prayer to Jesus.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages modern historians and theologians (e.g., James Dunn, N. T. Wright, Larry Hurtado), uses extensive exegesis of OT (YHWH texts), intertestamental literature, and NT manuscripts.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (OT and NT continuity), Christology (divine identity of Jesus), Monotheism, Worship, Incarnation, Soteriology (vindication and atonement implications), implications for Trinitarian reflection.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The New Testament's confession that Jesus is the God of Israel reconfigures Jewish monotheism into a christological monotheism: God's self-revelation culminates in the crucified and risen Jesus, who is both worshiped as YHWH and disclosed as the suffering-vindicated God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - The phrase **"God crucified"** as a theological paradox: the crucified Jesus is identified with the God of Israel, making divine suffering the center of Christian theology.
 - Stresses **continuity** between Israel's God and the Jesus-confession, rather than rupture or Hellenistic synthesis.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against views that locate high Christology primarily in Hellenistic contexts or as late developments; argues for earlier and Jewish-embedded origins.
 - Challenges overly cautious readings that reduce Jesus' divine titles to mere function or metaphor.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treats **divine identity** (not merely divine function or status) as the key category for understanding NT Christology.
 - Emphasizes the theological import of appellations and narrative actions that align Jesus with YHWH.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely influential among evangelicals and academic Christians; used in Reformed circles to defend high Christology without capitulating to Hellenistic dualism.
 - Stimulated renewed exegetical studies on YHWH-text application to Jesus and influenced trinitarian retrievals that begin with Christ's divine identity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Robust exegetical grounding for the claim that early Christian worship of Jesus is coherent with OT monotheism; indispensable for courses on New Testament Christology, early Jewish-Christian relations, and theological reflection on divine suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God of Israel:** Central referent; Bauckham argues Jesus is identified as this God in NT witness.
- **God crucified:** Paradoxical formulation indicating that the crucified Jesus is the one Israel worships as God.
- **Divine identity:** The concept that Jesus shares the same personal identity-language and functions attributed to YHWH.
- **Kyrios/YHWH interchange:** Use of the title Kyrios to translate or stand in for YHWH application to Jesus.
- **Worship (latreia):** Investigation of early Christian prayer/adoration directed to Jesus as genuine worship of God.
- **Monotheism (christological monotheism):** Reinterpretation of Jewish monotheism to include worship of the incarnate/divine Jesus.
- **Enthronement/vindication:** Resurrection and exaltation as the vindication that grounds divine status claims.
- **Divine suffering:** Theological category establishing that God's self-revelation includes suffering in Christ.
- **Witness and confession:** Emphasis on the early church's eyewitness testimony as the source of high Christological claims.
- **OT-NT continuity:** Methodological insistence that NT claims are read against Israel's theological vocabulary.
- **Incarnation (implicit):** Treated as how divine identity becomes manifest in Jesus without full systematic development of Trinitarian ontology.
- **Revelation of the Trinity (place-holder):** While not a systematic Trinitarian treatise, the work forces Trinitarian reflection by showing NT treats Jesus as God alongside the God of Israel.
- **Polemic target:** Corrects reductionist historical models that secularize or separate high Christology from Jewish monotheism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT divine titles and applying YHWH-texts to Jesus.
- As a **definition source** for the claim that NT worship of Jesus is compatible with biblical monotheism (useful in systematic theology and apologetics).
- As a **polemic** against theories that detach early Christology from Jewish roots or that naturalize it as purely Hellenistic.
