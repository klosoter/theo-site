### TITLE
Inspiration - B. B. Warfield (article in International Standard Bible Encyclopedia)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton context; product of conservative Reformed response to German higher criticism, Darwinian challenges, and emerging modernism. Published as an ISBE encyclopedia entry synthesizing Warfield's larger essays on bibliology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defense of the Bible's divine inspiration and resulting inerrancy: Scripture is the authoritative, trustworthy Word of God because the Holy Spirit superintended its production without destroying human authorship.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define inspiration doctrinally: a supernatural influence of the Spirit producing Scripture as divine revelation.
 - Distinguish models:
 - Reject mechanical dictation; affirm **plenary, verbal, organic** inspiration.
 - Preserve genuine human authorship (style, personality) while holding God's words to be truly present.
 - Identify scope of inerrancy: Scripture is free from error in all that it affirms (especially in doctrine and the matters intended by the authors); ultimate defense of the autographs' inerrancy.
 - Respond to critics:
 - Counter higher criticism and naturalistic accounts by arguing for supernatural revelation and historical reliability where Scripture intends to teach.
 - Emphasize authority: inspiration grounds the Bible's normative authority for faith and life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interlocutors broadly include German higher critics, liberal theologians of the late 19th/early 20th centuries, and variant Protestant positions (dictation advocates, "limited inspiration" proponents). Warfield stands in the Princeton line (Hodge, later Machen as ally) while dialoguing with historical-critical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, authority of Scripture, human authorship vs. divine authorship, canonicity implications (autographs emphasized).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's center of gravity: Scripture is a divinely produced, verbally reliable record-supernaturally inspired and authoritative in all it affirms while remaining genuinely human in style and personality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong articulation of **plenary verbal inspiration**: God inspired the whole Scripture and its words, not merely general thoughts.
 - Adoption of an **organic (non-dictational) model** that preserves human authorship and style while asserting divine superintendence.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects strict mechanical dictation theories by affirming human agency.
 - Opposes "limited" or "selective" inspiration that confines divine truth to salvific or doctrinal passages only.
 - Polemical posture against secularizing higher criticism that reduces Scripture to merely human literature.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise coupling of **inspiration** with **inerrancy**: inspiration as causal ground; inerrancy as consequence applied to autographs and to what Scripture intends to teach.
 - Clarifies relation of inspiration to **illumination** (distinct phenomena: inspiration concerns the text; illumination concerns the reader/understanding).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and broader evangelical bibliology; foundational for 20th-century defenses of inerrancy (e.g., fundamentalist-modernist controversies; later formulations in evangelical inerrancy statements).
 - Also drew critique from liberal scholars and later evangelicals who argued for more nuanced engagement with historical-critical methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a rigorous, systematic defense of classical Protestant bibliology that remains a primary reference for teaching on divine inspiration and the authority of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plenary inspiration** - The whole of Scripture is inspired; no parts are excluded from divine influence.
- **Verbal inspiration** - God's inspiration extends to the words (not merely ideas) chosen by the biblical authors.
- **Organic inspiration** - Human authors' personalities, styles, and faculties are retained; inspiration is not mechanical dictation.
- **Dictation theory** - Rejected model that Scripture is merely the verbatim dictation of God to passive scribes.
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture is without error in all that it affirms; Warfield emphasizes inerrancy of the autographs.
 - Relation: inerrancy is the logical consequence of divine inspiration.
- **Illumination** - Distinct from inspiration; the Spirit's work enabling understanding in readers rather than producing the text.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Grounded in inspiration; Scripture's normative role for faith, doctrine, and life follows from divine authorship.
- **Autographs** - The original manuscripts; Warfield insists inerrancy properly applies to these originals.
- **Revelation** - God's self-disclosure; inspiration is the Spirit's act rendering that revelation into reliable written form.
- **Higher criticism** - Historical-critical methodologies that Warfield critiques for naturalistic presuppositions undermining divine revelation.
- **Concurrentism / Instrumentality** - The model describing the mutual action of God and human agents in producing Scripture.
- **Infallibility** - Often used interchangeably but Warfield clarifies infallibility as the practical trustworthiness tied to inspiration/inerrancy.
- **Canon / Canonicity** - Implicit in treatment: inspiration is presupposed in recognizing the canon's normative texts.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and terminological standard for plenary/verbal inspiration and the doctrine of inerrancy in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic and apologetic** resource against higher criticism, modernist readings, and any attenuated version of inspiration.
- As a **pedagogical model** in bibliology courses for articulating the relationship between divine and human authorship and defending the authority of Scripture.
