### TITLE
Systematic Theology: Volume 1 (edited and with essays by John Webster) - focused essays including treatment of **Absolute and Relative Attributes**. Published in the late 20th / early 21st-century context of renewed dogmatic theology; Wesleyan-Reformed and Barthian interlocution throughout.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-modern resurgence of dogmatic theology attentive to Scripture, Trinitarian form, and critique of both liberal historicism and reductive analytic theology.
 - Webster writes from a Reformed, Barthian-informed perspective that privileges revelation and the Word-event for systematic formulation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to speak coherently of God's attributes without fracturing the divine unity or denying the reality of God's relations to creation; specifically, how to understand the distinction between **absolute** (attributes independent of creatures) and **relative** (attributes that presuppose relation to creatures) predicates of God in a Trinitarian, christological frame.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - God must be known primarily through divine self‑revelation in the Word (Scripture and Incarnation); attributes are not neutral scalar properties but **theological predicates rooted in God's triune life and saving acts**.
 - Reframes the absolute/relative distinction:
 - Absolute attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability) are asserted, but are reinterpreted so they do not become abstractions severed from God's triune perichoresis.
 - Relative attributes (Fatherhood, Redeemer, Creator, covenant‑maker) are not secondary accidents but fundamental expressions of God's being as disclosed in Christ.
 - Major moves:
 - Critique of scholastic compartmentalization of attributes.
 - Recovery of Trinitarian ordering: attributes are first and foremost Trinitarian predicates.
 - Emphasis on the dynamic, evental character of divine attributes as disclosed in revelation and covenantal acts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Barthian sources prominent (Karl Barth as formative interlocutor).
 - Engagement with classical theists (Aquinas, scholastic treatments), Reformed scholasticism (Turretin, Calvin), and contemporary analytic and constructive theologians.
 - Scriptural exegesis undergirds doctrinal claims.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (divine attributes, aseity, simplicity, immutability, omnipotence/omniscience).
 - Trinity (ordering principle for attribute predication).
 - Revelation and Christology (attributes disclosed in the Word and the person/work of Christ).
 - Implicit consequences for soteriology and covenant theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Webster centers theological speech on the self‑communicative, Trinitarian God: attributes are true insofar as they are predicates of the God who acts and is known in the Word incarnate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Attributes are read christologically and trinitarianly: predicates derive their intelligibility from God's self‑revelation rather than metaphysical abstraction.
 - Strong insistence that divine predicates are theologically performative (they describe God's self‑acts) not merely descriptive qualities.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects scholastic tendencies that isolate attributes into static categories; opposes any account that treats absolute attributes as prior to or independent of God's relational life.
 - Distinguishes itself from natural theology that attempts to infer attributes apart from revelation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Stresses the language of **theological grammar**: how predicate use depends on scriptural and Trinitarian contexts.
 - Recasts "relative" attributes as revelatory rather than derivative predicates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely taken up in contemporary Reformed and evangelical theological circles concerned with recovery of dogmatics grounded in Scripture and the Trinity.
 - Influential among theologians seeking to navigate between classical metaphysics and contemporary linguistic/relational emphases.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable corrective to fragmented attribute-talk by reuniting doctrinal loci around the Word‑event and the triune life.
 - Useful for advanced courses on doctrine of God, theological method, and Trinitarian dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Predicates traditionally conceived as independent of creation (aseity, immutability, simplicity); in Webster reframed so they do not eclipse relational revelation.

- **Relative attributes**
 - Predicates that presuppose relation to creatures (Fatherhood, Redeemer, Providence); treated as primary for theological intelligibility because grounded in revelation.

- **Aseity**
 - Divine self‑existence; affirmed but explicated within God's communicative, covenantal life.

- **Divine simplicity**
 - Retained as a safeguard against composition but nuanced to avoid making God unintelligible to trinitarian predication.

- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Rearticulated to account for God's faithful, responsive action in history without collapsing into passibility or caprice.

- **Ad intra / Ad extra**
 - Internal (intra‑Trinitarian) and external (relation to creation) actions used to show that attributes cannot be cleanly separated from Trinitarian life.

- **Theological grammar**
 - The rules and contexts that govern how terms for God are properly predicated; emphasizes Scripture and incarnation as the grammar's source.

- **Predicate vs. Act (attributes as acts)**
 - Shifts emphasis from static qualities to God's saving acts as the proper grounding of attribute language.

- **Revelation (Word‑event)**
 - Central hermeneutical principle; attributes are discerned in the Word made flesh and the scriptural testimony.

- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)**
 - Treated cautiously; analogical predication affirmed but subordinated to revelational priority.

- **Trinitarian perichoresis**
 - Used to explain how relational predicates are internal to divine life and thus compatible with unity.

- **Christological ordering**
 - Attributes are finally intelligible in light of Christ's person and work.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary, revelation‑rooted accounts of divine attributes.
- As a **polemic** against both classical scholastic fragmentation and reductive natural theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical predicates of God through Trinitarian and christological lenses.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of God, Trinity, and Christology in systematic teaching.
