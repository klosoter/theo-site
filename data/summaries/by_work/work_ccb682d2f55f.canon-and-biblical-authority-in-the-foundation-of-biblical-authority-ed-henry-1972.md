### TITLE
**Canon and Biblical Authority** - Vern Poythress, in The Foundation of Biblical Authority (ed. Henry, 1972)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published within a 1970s evangelical/Reformed conversation about how Scripture functions as norm for church and theology.
 - Responds to pressures from historical-critical scholarship, Roman Catholic appeals to Tradition, and internal Protestant disputes over canon and hermeneutics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The essay locates the decisive criterion of theological authority in the canonical Scriptures, and examines the relation between the canon and ecclesial Tradition so as to preserve Scripture's normative finality without denying the church's formative role.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary confusion arises from conflating tradition (church practice, reception, creeds) with the normative status of canonical texts.
 - Positive thesis: the canon provides a determinate, God-ordained corpus whose authority is constitutive for doctrine and interpretation.
 - Mediating claims:
 - Tradition plays an indispensable epistemic and formative role (recognition, preservation, reception), but it is derivative - not co-equal - to canonical authority.
 - The process of canon formation is best understood as recognition by the believing community of texts rooted in divine revelation, not as invention of normative content by the church.
 - Proper hermeneutics requires submission to the canonical shape and internal coherence of Scripture while attending to historical reception.
 - Practical consequences: theological method must treat confessional and ecclesial traditions as aids and tests for interpretation rather than as parallel sources of revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicitly contrasts Roman Catholic models that posit Tradition as co-authoritative and modern critical scholars who relativize canonical claims.
 - Draws on patristic precedents for recognition theory of canon and on Reformed confessionalists who emphasize sola scriptura.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, authority of Scripture, canon formation, ecclesiology (role of the church in recognition), hermeneutics, and criteria for doctrinal formulation (confession).
- **Closing line**
 - Theological authority must be anchored in the canonical word; the church's tradition is a faithful servant of that canon, not its peer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses a balanced account: tradition as necessary for recognition and application, but canon as the controlling norm.
 - Emphasizes the social/communal act of recognition without collapsing recognition into authorship.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against models that elevate ecclesial Tradition to co-equal revelatory status (Roman Catholicism).
 - Also critiques private historicism that treats canon as merely contingent literary outcome with no normative finality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the distinction between "recognition" (how canon is acknowledged within the church) and "authorization" (how God authorizes Scripture).
 - Frames canon as both a theological and canonical hermeneutical criterion - not merely a historical fact but a normative boundary for exegesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Reformed and conservative evangelical apologetics and hermeneutics for providing a workable middle path between fideism and relativism.
 - Cited in later works on canonical hermeneutics and by writers who seek to defend sola scriptura in an academically respectable way.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a concise, serviceable defense of canonical primacy that respects the church's role; continues to serve introductory and methodological courses on Scripture and authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - The closed corpus of Scriptures that serves as the final rule for faith and practice; the primary normative center in Poythress's account.
- **Authority**
 - The binding power of the canonical text over church belief and life; grounded in divine revelation and mediated by recognition.
- **Tradition**
 - The life, reception, creeds, and practices of the church that witness to and preserve the canon; important but derivative.
- **Recognition**
 - The church's act of acknowledging certain texts as Scripture; epistemic role rather than constitutive authorship.
- **Inspiration**
 - Divine origin or authorial causality of the canonical texts; provides the ultimate warrant for authority.
- **Normativity**
 - The status by which Scripture sets theological boundaries and standards for interpretation and doctrine.
- **Hermeneutics**
 - The method of reading Scripture which must be shaped by canonical shape, internal coherence, and ecclesial reception.
- **Closure**
 - The concept that the canon is a bounded collection; closure secures doctrinal stability and precludes extra-biblical revelation as equal norm.
- **Ecclesial reception**
 - The historical and communal process through which the church receives, preserves, and hands on the canon.
- **Confession**
 - Creedal and confessional formulations that summarize canonical teaching; treated as subordinate summaries, not substitutes.
- **Criterion**
 - Standards used to test writings for canonical status: apostolicity, orthodoxy, catholicity, and liturgical use (as discussed indirectly).
- **Self-authentication**
 - The idea that Scripture bears marks of divine origin; Poythress balances this with the church's recognizing role.
- **Biblical theology**
 - Reading the canon as a unified theological whole; recommended as corrective to proof-texting and fragmented doctrine.
- **Church**
 - The community that receives and applies the canon; necessary for the life of Scripture in practice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and methodological source defending **sola scriptura** against rival claims of co-equal Tradition.
- As a polemical resource in debates over canon formation and the theological status of ecclesial tradition.
- As a conceptual pivot in teaching hermeneutics and ecclesiology: shows how canonical authority shapes confession and preaching.
