### TITLE
God's Indwelling Presence: The Holy Spirit in the Old and New Testament - James M. Hamilton Jr. (2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical/ Reformed biblical theology conversation; published amid renewed interest in canonical, covenantal readings of Scripture and corrective responses to both charismatic excesses and dispensational/dualistic separations of Testaments.
 - Hamilton writes from a conservative, confessional background with strong engagement in biblical-theological method (canonical-historical emphasis).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the single, continuous, covenantal presence of God operative throughout redemptive history; the Spirit who empowers, inspires, and indwells in the Old Testament finds his full, personal, permanent expression in the New Covenant through Christ, especially at Pentecost and in Christian regeneration.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of Spirit activity across the canon: creation, election, judges/saints, prophets, exile, and eschatological promises.
 - Exposition of key Old Testament promise texts (e.g., Joel, Ezekiel 36) and their fulfillment in the New Testament (e.g., John 14-16; Acts 2).
 - Theological synthesis: distinguishes types and degrees of Spirit-present activity (temporary empowerment, prophetic inspiration, corporate presence) from the unique, permanent indwelling inaugurated in Christ.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal implications: regeneration, sealing, baptism with the Spirit, and the Spirit's role in sanctification and union with Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages canonical texts primarily; interacts with recent biblical theologians (e.g., Geerhardus Vos tradition, Graeme Goldsworthy-style canonical reading), and dialogues implicitly with both charismatic pneumatology and cessationist/discontinuity positions.
 - Uses exegetical work on OT prophecy and NT narrative (Acts, Pauline epistles, Johannine pneumatology).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, covenant theology (continuity of covenant promises), Christology (Spirit as agent applying Christ's work), soteriology (regeneration, sanctification), ecclesiology (corporate indwelling and mission), revelation/Scripture (Spirit and prophetic inspiration).

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the Holy Spirit is God's covenantal, personal presence who moves redemptive history toward consummation by indwelling believers in Christ-uniting OT promise and NT fulfillment in one continuous pneumatological story.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Canonical-historical tracing of the Spirit: reads OT and NT as one unfolding economy of Spirit-presence rather than two disparate regimes.
 - Clear differentiation between temporary/functional Spirit empowerment (OT judges, craftsmen, prophets) and the qualitatively new, permanent indwelling associated with the New Covenant and Christian regeneration.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that the Spirit was largely absent in the Old Testament; insists on continuity while denying mere equivalency (i.e., not every OT instance equals NT indwelling).
 - Pushes back against both extreme cessationism (no direct OT/NT continuity) and some charismatic readings that flatten distinctions between types of Spirit activity.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Careful terminological parsing of "indwelling," "filling," "empowerment," and "promise" with theological-historical nuance-emphasizes typological/progressive realization across covenants.
 - Treats "indwelling presence" as a technical axis to measure continuity and discontinuity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a reliable, biblically faithful synthesis; used in seminary courses on pneumatology and biblical theology.
 - Cited in discussions that seek a mediating posture between strict continuity and radical discontinuity models.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, exegetically-grounded corrective to simplistic readings of Spirit-history.
 - Useful for pastors and teachers seeking a unified biblical pneumatology that ties covenant promises to practical doctrines of regeneration and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Indwelling presence**
 - The Spirit's abiding presence in persons; central category Hamilton traces from OT seeds to NT fullness.

- **Regeneration**
 - The Spirit's internal, qualitative work effecting new life in believers; identified as the decisive New Covenant reality.

- **Filling**
 - Functional empowerment distinct from indwelling; can be temporary (OT, Acts) or progressively normative (NT sanctification).

- **New Covenant**
 - The locus of promised permanent indwelling (Ezekiel 36; Jeremiah 31; fulfilled in Christ/Pentecost).

- **Temporary empowerment**
 - OT instances (Judges, craftsmen, prophets) where Spirit equips but does not permanently indwell the whole people.

- **Promise of the Spirit**
 - Prophetic anticipations (Joel, Ezekiel) that prefigure Pentecost and New Covenant gift.

- **Pentecost**
 - The inaugurative event that manifests fulfillment of the promise and initiates normative indwelling among believers and the church.

- **Baptism of the Spirit**
 - Unional, corporate/individual reality by which believers are incorporated into Christ; key for Hamilton's soteriological account.

- **Sealing**
 - The Spirit as mark of possession and guarantee of inheritance; linked to assurance and perseverance.

- **Messianic Spirit**
 - OT language (Isa 11) that Hamilton reads as pointing forward to Christ and the Spirit in his messianic work.

- **Prophetic inspiration**
 - The Spirit's role in Scripture production and revelation; continuity between OT prophetic activity and NT canonical authority.

- **Corporate vs individual presence**
 - Distinguishes corporate (Israel, tabernacle/temple presence) from individual indwelling emphasized in NT.

- **Empowerment vs presence**
 - Clarifies functional empowerment (doing) vs ontological indwelling (being).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for Reformed pneumatology distinguishing types of Spirit-activity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Spirit texts canonically (OT promises → NT fulfillment).
 - As a **polemic resource** against both historical neglect of OT pneumatology and unchecked conflation of OT/NT Spirit activity.
