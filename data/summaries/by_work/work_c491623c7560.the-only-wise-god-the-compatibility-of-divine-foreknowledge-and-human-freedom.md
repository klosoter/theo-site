### TITLE
The Only Wise God: The Compatibility of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic theology and philosophy of religion; part of the revival of interest in Molinism within evangelical and analytic circles.
 - Written by William Lane Craig, a leading philosopher-theologian engaged in debates over divine providence, omniscience, and human freedom.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Thesis: Divine foreknowledge and libertarian human freedom are compatible because God possesses a threefold knowledge (natural, middle, free); God's **middle knowledge** (scientia media) of counterfactuals of freedom allows God to sovereignly actualize a world while preserving creaturely libertarian freedom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Molinism: distinguishes **natural knowledge** (what God knows of necessities and general truths), **middle knowledge** (what free creatures would do in any hypothetically specified circumstance), and **free knowledge** (what God knows about the actual world he freely chooses to create).
 - Modal apparatus: God surveys possible worlds and, on the basis of middle knowledge, selects a world to actualize in which providential ends and free choices coexist.
 - Responses to objections:
 - Philosophical objections (e.g., the grounding objection about the metaphysical status/truthmakers of counterfactuals of freedom).
 - Theological objections (charges that Molinism compromises divine sovereignty or renders providence contingent).
 - Scriptural and doctrinal defense: exegetical engagement with biblical texts on prophecy, election, and providence to show compatibility with orthodox doctrines.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical source: Luis de Molina (sixteenth century).
 - Opponents and interlocutors: Thomist/Calvinist compatibilists (Aquinas, classical Reformed readings), Open Theists (e.g., Pinnock, Boyd-type positions), philosophers raising the grounding objection.
 - Contemporary conversation partners include analytic philosophers of religion and evangelical theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (omniscience, sovereignty, providence)
 - Human freedom (libertarian freedom)
 - Foreknowledge and prophecy
 - Theodicy implications indirectly (how world selection relates to the existence of evil)

- **Closing line**
 - The work asserts that a robust Molinist account secures both **God's wise, providential agency** and **genuine libertarian freedom** by locating theological decision in God's middle knowledge and free choice of a world to actualize.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Clear, systematic defense of **scientia media** as the keystone for reconciling foreknowledge and libertarian freedom.
 - Uses contemporary modal/possible-worlds language to make Molina's insight philosophically rigorous and accessible to analytic theology.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Thomistic/Calvinist compatibilism by rejecting the claim that foreknowledge requires determinism.
 - Opposes Open Theism by affirming exhaustive divine foreknowledge while preserving contingency via middle knowledge.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes Molinism with analytic precision: articulates how God's **knowledge of counterfactuals** functions in providential planning without reducing creaturely spontaneity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among evangelical philosophers and theologians; pivotal in the contemporary resurgence of Molinism.
 - Criticized by some Thomists/Reformed theologians and by philosophers who press the grounding objection or who argue Molinism weakens divine sovereignty.

- **Enduring value**
 - Presents a compact, philosophically disciplined case for Molinism that remains a primary point of reference in debates on providence, foreknowledge, and free will.
 - Valuable pedagogically: clear structure, engages key objections, and supplies a usable exegetical and conceptual toolkit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any possible situation; the central mechanism reconciling foreknowledge and freedom.
- **Natural knowledge** - God's knowledge of necessary truths and non-contingent facts.
- **Free knowledge** - God's knowledge of the actual world he freely chooses to create.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom** - Truths about what free agents would do under specified hypotheticals; the content of middle knowledge.
- **Libertarian freedom** - View that free choices are not causally determined and that agents could do otherwise in identical circumstances.
- **Compatibilism** - The rival view that divine foreknowledge and determinism are compatible because human freedom is compatible with causation.
- **Grounding objection** - Philosophical challenge asking what metaphysically grounds the truth of counterfactuals of freedom (a central contemporary critique).
- **Providence / actualization** - God's selection and bringing-into-being of one possible world from among many, guided by middle knowledge.
- **Omniscience / foreknowledge** - God's exhaustive knowledge including truths about future free acts (reconciled here via middle knowledge).
- **Possible worlds / modal language** - The analytic framework Craig uses to describe God's knowledge and choice among possible courses of history.
- **Theodicy implication** - How God's choice of world interacts with the presence of evil and moral responsibility.
- **Timelessness / divine temporality** - Background assumptions about God's relation to time that interact with claims about foreknowledge (treated sympathetically but not the central focus).
- **Transworld depravity (contrast)** - Plantinga's account often discussed in modal debates about why God could not create a world where all are morally good; used for comparative critique.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitive modern exposition of Molinism** for courses on providence and divine knowledge.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Open Theism and compatibilist determinism.
 - As an **exegetical-philosophical model** for reading biblical foreknowledge and prophecy in a way that preserves libertarian freedom.
