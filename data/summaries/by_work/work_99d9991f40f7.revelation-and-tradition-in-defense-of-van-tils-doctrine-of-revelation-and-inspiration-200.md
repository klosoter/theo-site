### TITLE
Revelation and Tradition: In Defense of Van Til's Doctrine of Revelation and Inspiration (Richard B. Gaffin Jr., 2008)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2008 within a late-20th/early-21st century Reformed renewal that revisits Cornelius Van Til's presuppositional approach.
 - A corrective and retrieval aimed at both evangelical critics and Reformed students unsettled by mid-20th-century debates over propositionality, inspiration, and the role of tradition.
 - Conversant with debates involving Barthian neo-orthodoxy, classical apologetics, and confessional inerrancy conversations.

- **Central thesis**
 - Van Til's doctrine of revelation and inspiration is coherent, scripturally grounded, and properly understood as an integrated account that preserves both the propositional character of divine revelation and its organic, covenantal/Christocentric center. Gaffin defends this reading against caricatured oppositions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify the common misunderstandings of Van Til (e.g., charges of subjectivism, denial of propositional revelation).
 - Show that Van Til consistently roots revelation in the triune God and centers revelation in Christ; Scripture functions as propositional witness to Christ rather than merely human religious experience.
 - Demonstrate how Van Til's view preserves divine authorship and human mediation-Scripture is both verbally authoritative and an organic testimony grounded in historical redemptive events.
 - Argue that Van Til's epistemology (presuppositionalism) secures the self-authenticating character of revelation without collapsing into circularity or irrationalism.
 - Draw exegetical and theological implications for doctrines of inspiration, inerrancy, and the relation of general to special revelation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal: Cornelius Van Til (doctrinal target of defense).
 - Interlocutors: Karl Barth/neo-orthodoxy (contrast on propositionality and Scripture), classical apologists (contrast on neutral common ground), B. B. Warfield and Reformed confessional tradition (points of affinity and development).
 - Scriptural and confessional resources used to ground the argument.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general and special), **inspiration** (divine and human agency), **authority and inerrancy** of Scripture, **Christocentric** nature of revelation, epistemological presuppositions in apologetics.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin situates Van Til's doctrine as a robust Reformed synthesis: revelation is the triune God's propositional self-disclosure in history, centered in Christ and authoritatively conveyed through Scripture as both divinely inspired and humanly mediated.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that Van Til affirms propositional revelation while refusing a detached, abstracted "propositionism" divorced from redemptive-historical context.
 - Emphasis on Scripture as a witness to the one living revelation (Christ) rather than as simply a repository of isolated propositions.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that portray Van Til as anti-intellectual, anti-propositional, or subjectivist.
 - Contrasts Van Til's presuppositional epistemology with:
 - Classical apologetics (which appeals to neutral common ground).
 - Barthian neo-orthodoxy (which sometimes downplays propositional content or historicity of Scripture).
 - Aligns Van Til more closely with confessional Reformed commitments (e.g., Warfield's affirmation of divine authorship) while pressing differences in epistemological method.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reinforces Van Til's framing of revelation as simultaneously **propositional** and **organic**-propositions are not abstractions but communicative acts embedded in God's redemptive self-disclosure.
 - Reiterates the epistemic heuristic of **presuppositional coherence**: Christian truth-claims function as ultimate explanatory presuppositions rather than neutral evidential addenda.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Strengthens contemporary Reformed defenses of presuppositional apologetics and influences teaching in confessional seminaries.
 - Rehabilitates Van Til among evangelicals wary of alleged anti-propositional leanings; used as a bridge between strict confessionalism and thoughtful apologetic engagement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a corrective reading of Van Til that integrates doctrinal fidelity, biblical-theological sensitivity, and apologetic seriousness-especially useful for pastors, seminarians, and theologians engaged in doctrine of revelation and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (General vs Special)**
 - General: providential/creational testimony to God's being and attributes; insufficient for salvation.
 - Special: redemptive/historical self-disclosure in Christ and Scripture; decisive for knowledge of salvation.

- **Propositional revelation**
 - Revelation conveyed in objective propositional content; propositions are embedded in historical witness, not abstracted facts.

- **Organic testimony**
 - The idea that Scripture functions as living testimony to Christ-authoritative because of its role in the covenantal-historical act of revelation.

- **Self-authenticating revelation**
 - Revelation provides its own warrant; Gaffin defends Van Til's claim that Scripture's authority is not merely derivative from external proofs.

- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Epistemological stance that faith's truth-claims are ultimate presuppositions for rationality; denies neutral starting point for theological inquiry.

- **Inspiration (divine-human)**
 - Scripture as product of divine authorship and genuine human agency; upholds verbal authority without crude dictation.

- **Inerrancy**
 - Affirmed within the framework that Scripture's propositional content, properly understood in redemptive-historical context, is true and without error.

- **Christocentric hermeneutic**
 - Reading Scripture primarily as witness to Christ; revelation's center is personal (Christ) rather than merely textual.

- **Antithesis**
 - Deep divide between Christian and non-Christian thought-worlds; underpins presuppositional critique of neutral reason.

- **Epistemological theism**
 - Theistic framework as grounding for knowledge and intelligibility; God as ultimate norm and presupposition.

- **Tradition (Reformed/confessional)**
 - Use of confessional resources to anchor Van Til in historic Reformed doctrine.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a coherent Reformed account of revelation that integrates propositionality and organic testimony.
- As a **polemic** against neo-orthodoxy and classical apologetics that downplay the necessity of Christian presuppositions.
- As an **exegetical/hermeneutical model** for reading Scripture as witness to Christ and for grounding inerrancy within redemptive history.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminars on epistemology, apologetics, and doctrine of Scripture.
