### TITLE
Common Grace (ESV Study Bible, 2008) - Wayne Grudem

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Entry in the 2008 ESV Study Bible, aimed at evangelical readers; reflects late 20th-early 21st-century Reformed/evangelical concerns about Scripture, culture, and pastoral theology. 
 - Connects to Wayne Grudem's wider corpus (Systematic Theology) and the broader evangelical reception of Reformed categories.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - God bestows a non-saving, universal benevolence-"common grace"-that restrains sin, supplies general blessings, and in some ways prepares people to hear the gospel, while remaining distinct from saving (special) grace.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Definition: Common grace is God's favorable, non-redemptive activity toward the whole human race. 
 - Biblical data: Passages cited to justify the category include Matthew 5:45 (sun/rain for wicked and righteous), Acts 14:17 (God gives rain/food), Romans 2:4 (kindness leads to repentance but not inevitably saving), John 1:9 (light that is general), and 1 Timothy 2:4 (God desires all to be saved as expression, not mechanism). 
 - Functions identified:
 - Restraining of sin (moral/civil order maintained). 
 - Provision of common gifts (life, culture, rationality, moral conscience). 
 - General revelation that makes God known enough to be accountable and to enable moral response. 
 - "Preparatory grace" - non-saving influences that can make some receptive to the gospel without effecting salvation.
 - Demarcation: Repeated insistence that common/preparatory grace does not produce faith, regenerate hearts, or nullify the need for saving grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit conversation with classical Reformed formulations (Calvinic providence), Kuyperian emphases (culture/common grace debates), Wesleyan/Arminian notions of prevenient grace, and contemporary evangelical uses of "common grace." Grudem leans on Scripture and pastoral-theological utility more than historical-systematic exhaustiveness.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Providence, Revelation (general), Sin, Salvation (contrast between common and saving grace), Election (by implication in the distinction), Ecclesiology in cultural engagement.

- **Closing line:** 
 - Common (and preparatory) grace: God's universal, non-saving benevolence that sustains creation, restrains evil, and prepares some for the gospel while remaining decisively distinct from the regenerating work of saving grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Clear triage language: strict separation between **common/preparatory grace** and **saving grace**; common grace can make people *receptive* but not *regenerate*. 
 - Practical cultural-focus: attention to common grace as foundation for Christian participation in civil life and cultural achievements.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushback against conflating common grace with Wesleyan prevenient grace (which is often construed as enabling salvation). Grudem affirms a preparatory role but denies salvific efficacy. 
 - Moderates some Kuyperian tendencies that ascribe too robust an autonomous cultural mandate to common grace without proper covenantal/soteriological limits.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Prominent use of the term **"preparatory grace"** within an evangelical-Reformed framework to describe non-saving divine influences that precede hearing and responding to the gospel.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely circulated due to ESV Study Bible platform; influential among conservative evangelicals and pastors seeking concise biblical grounding for cultural engagement. 
 - Criticized by some Reformed theorists for possible understatement of common grace's cultural implications or for insufficient historical nuance.

- **Enduring value:** 
 - Clear, pastorally usable summation of common vs. saving grace; useful for preaching, apologetics, and practical theology regarding Christian involvement in society.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace:** God's favorable, non-saving actions toward all people (provision, restraint, gifts). 
- **Saving (special) grace:** Regenerative, effectual grace that alone brings salvation. 
- **Preparatory grace:** Non-saving divine influences that prepare certain individuals to hear/receive the gospel. 
- **Prevenient grace (contrast):** Wesleyan term for grace that precedes and enables saving response; Grudem distinguishes this from his preparatory/common grace by denying salvific enabling. 
- **General revelation:** Knowledge of God available to all via creation, conscience, history-foundation for accountability and common grace. 
- **Providence (common):** God's sustaining governance that cares for both righteous and wicked (weather, food, social order). 
- **Restraint of sin:** Thequasi-moral effect of God's governance that limits evil in society. 
- **Common gifts/benefits:** Talents, societal goods, culture, science, and civil peace given apart from salvation. 
- **Accountability:** The moral consequence of general revelation and common grace-humans are held responsible because God has made himself known generally. 
- **Non-salvific benevolence:** Phrase summarizing the qualitative limit of common grace - good but not redemptive. 
- **Cultural mandate (practical use):** Use of common grace to justify Christian participation in and contributions to secular culture. 
- **Effectual calling (contrast):** The particular divine act that results in regeneration and salvation; not to be conflated with preparatory/common grace.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a concise definitional and exegetical source on common vs. special grace in pastoral and classroom settings. 
- As a polemical resource distinguishing Reformed/common-grace categories from Wesleyan/Arminian prevenient-grace claims and from less restrained Kuyperian formulations of cultural autonomy. 
- As an exegetical model for interpreting Scriptures about God's general goodness, providence, and human accountability.
