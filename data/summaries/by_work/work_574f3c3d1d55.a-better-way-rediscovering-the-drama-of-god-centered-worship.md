### TITLE
A Better Way: Rediscovering the Drama of God-Centered Worship - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the early 21st century amid Reformed liturgical renewal and growing critique of seeker-sensitive, consumerist worship models.
 - Addresses pastors, elders, and lay leaders within conservative Protestant and Reformed circles seeking pastoral and doctrinal grounding for worship reform.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary evangelical worship is too often human-centered, therapeutic, or entertainment-driven; Horton argues for a recovered, **God-centered, covenantal liturgy** in which God acts and the church responds.
 - Worship should be shaped by Scripture, the creeds, and the sacraments as **means whereby God graciously encounters his people**.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern worship trends (consumerism, subjectivism, minimal sacramental awareness) corrupt gospel proclamation and ecclesial identity.
 - Retrieval: resources from Reformation and Puritan liturgical theology (Word and sacrament, catechesis, corporate prayer).
 - Prescription: practical reforms including the centrality of preaching, frequent and reverent administration of the Lord's Supper, guarded admission (fencing), and liturgical patterns that rehearse covenantal realities.
 - Pastoral appendices and suggestions for implementing a theological and practical worship plan in local congregations.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Calvin, the Westminster tradition, Reformed confessions, contemporary Reformed writers, and critiques of emergent/seeker models.
 - Engages liturgical renewal voices and responds polemically to therapeutic and postmodern worship trends.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Word (primacy of preaching), sacramentology (Lord's Supper presence, means of grace), covenant ecclesiology, liturgical theology, prayer, Christology (presence of Christ in worship), pastoral theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Horton seeks to recover worship as the drama in which God, by Word and sacrament, summons, judges, nourishes, and sends his covenant people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames worship explicitly as a **divine drama**: God is the principal actor; the congregation responds in covenant fidelity.
 - Strong insistence on the **means of grace** - not merely signs of faith but instruments by which God communicates covenant benefits (preaching, sacraments, prayer).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic and experiential tendencies that privatize faith by restoring corporate, objective, covenantal forms.
 - Opposes seeker-sensitive models that prioritize attraction and felt relevance over doctrinal substance and sacramental form.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the phrase **"God-centered worship"** as an alternative heuristic to consumer-focused paradigms.
 - Reframes liturgy as catechesis and pastoral formation rather than mere ritual.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed pastoral training and by churches pursuing liturgical reform; appreciated for pastoral clarity and confessional grounding.
 - Criticized by some for perceived rigidity or insufficient accommodation to cultural contexts; applauded by others for theological sobriety.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent, pastorally actionable model to reclaim preaching, sacraments, and prayer as formative means of grace and to reinstate biblical patterns of admission and discipline in the Lord's Supper.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered worship** - Worship ordered around God's actions and glory rather than human preferences.
- **Drama of worship** - Liturgical narrative where God initiates (Word), acts (sacraments), and sends (mission).
- **Means of grace** - Instruments God uses to convey grace; Horton emphasizes preaching, sacraments, and prayer as effective.
 - Preaching: primary means of Word communication and covenant summons.
 - Sacraments: visible promises and seals that actually convey grace.
 - Prayer: corporate shape and submission to God's rule.
- **Lord's Supper** - Central sacrament of covenant renewal; Horton insists on regular celebration as formative.
- **Presence of Christ (in the Supper)** - Reformed formulation: real, spiritual presence by the Spirit, not transubstantiation; the sacrament unites communicants with Christ.
- **Fencing and admission** - Pastoral practice of examining and restricting participation to those in covenant communion and sound doctrine; discipline and catechesis precede admission.
- **Covenantal liturgy** - Worship shaped by covenantal theology: summons, confession, Word, sacrament, benediction.
- **Catechesis** - Necessary preparation for covenant membership and sacramental participation.
- **Objective vs. subjective worship** - Horton argues for objective means (Word and sacraments) over subjective feeling-driven approaches.
- **Corporate prayer** - Liturgical prayer as formative speech under God's lordship, not merely congregational petitions.
- **Preaching as sacramental** - Preaching functions sacramentally as the spoken means by which God confronts and nourishes his people.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed liturgical renewal and the vocabulary of "God-centered worship."
 - As a **polemic and pastoral manual** against seeker-sensitive and emotive worship practices; deployed in training pastors on sacramental discipline (Lord's Supper: presence, fencing/admission).
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for understanding and structuring the means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer) in congregational life.
