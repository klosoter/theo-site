### TITLE
On the Emotional Life of Our Lord (essay in The Person and Work of Christ) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology; conservative Reformed milieu reacting to liberal and speculative currents.
 - Warfield writes amid debates about Christ's true humanity, divine impassibility, and the modern psychological reading of scripture.
 - Topic linkage: explicit treatment of **Human Nature Psychosomatic Unity** as the framework for understanding emotions in Christ.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jesus possessed a genuine, morally blameless emotional life - real affections and passions grounded in his human nature - that are compatible with his divine person and impeccability.
 - The problem addressed: how to affirm both the authenticity of Christ's emotional responses and the doctrines of his sinlessness and divine immutability.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of Gospel instances where Jesus manifests emotions (compassion, sorrow, anger, joy, love).
 - Philosophical-theological distinction between (i) emotion as psychophysical phenomena and (ii) moral culpability; establishes that emotions per se are not sinful.
 - Hypostatic interpretation: emotions are exercises of the human nature of the incarnate Word, genuinely felt because of psychosomatic unity, yet under the control of a sinless will.
 - Polemical refutation of two errors:
 - Denials that Jesus' emotions were authentic (docetic or reductionist scholarly positions).
 - Reduction of Christ's emotions to mere divine impassibility or to a modern sentimentality.
 - Concludes that Christ's affective life is exemplary and redemptive - both humanly real and theologically instructive.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: New Testament Gospel narratives and apostolic testimony.
 - Secondary: classical patristic and scholastic categories (passibility / impassibility), contemporary critics of the time (liberal theologians and certain philosophical theists).
 - Warfield dialogues implicitly with classical theism (on divine impassibility) and with modern psychology-informed biblical critics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, impeccability)
 - Anthropology (psychosomatic unity of human emotions)
 - Theodicy/atonement (Jesus as sympathetic high priest)
 - Divine attributes (passibility/impassibility, immutability)
 - Revelation (Christ as the paradigmatic disclosure of God in human feeling)

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the claim: the emotional life of Christ is both genuinely human and theologically indispensable - authentic affectivity within the hypostatic union, sinlessly exercised and redemptively purposed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the **psychosomatic unity** of Christ: emotions are bodily-soul functions, not epiphenomena or mere divine manifestations.
 - Affirms emotions as morally neutral capacities that in Christ are perfectly ordered to the divine will.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters pietistic sentimentalism that sentimentalizes Christ's feelings and Hegelian/liberal reductions that deny their reality.
 - Modifies classical impassibility: preserves divine immutability while denying that this implies absence of genuine human affect in the incarnate Son.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise delineation between *passibility* (capacity to suffer/feel) and *sinful passivity*; reclaims passibility as compatible with impeccability.
 - Uses nuanced psychological vocabulary to resist both docetic denials and reductionist naturalism.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed circles as a corrective to both overly abstract Christologies and modern critical denials of Jesus' humanity.
 - Frequently cited in debates over divine impassibility and the pastoral doctrine of Christ as sympathetic high priest.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, exegetically informed theological template for teaching Christ's humanity and pastoral empathy.
 - Useful as a model for integrating biblical exegesis with systematic distinctions about emotion and personhood.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Emotional life / affections** - the array of feelings Christ manifested (compassion, sorrow, anger, joy); treated as real components of his human life.
- **Passibility** - capacity to feel or suffer; affirmed for Christ in a non-sinful mode.
- **Impassibility** - classical attribute of God (frequently misunderstood); Warfield refines to allow human passibility in the incarnate Son without divine change.
- **Impeccability** - Christ's inability to sin; central to defending the moral integrity of his emotions.
- **Hypostatic Union** - the personal union of divine and human natures in Christ; framework for explaining how divine personhood does not negate human affectivity.
- **Psychosomatic unity** - the doctrine that human emotions are soul-body phenomena; used to argue emotions in Christ were bodily-real and not mere appearances.
- **Compassion (splanchnizomai-type terms)** - exegetical loci Warfield uses to show authentic feeling grounded in Scripture.
- **Sorrow / grief (lupe)** - exemplified in passages like Gethsemane; analyzed to show non-sinful existential suffering.
- **Righteous anger (orgē)** - distinguished from sinful passion; shows moral responsiveness.
- **Sympathy / high priestly empathy** - Christ's emotional engagement as salvifically efficacious (Hebrews motif).
- **Moral culpability vs. affective capacity** - crucial distinction: feelings do not equal sin.
- **Exemplary affectivity** - Christ's emotions as normative for Christian life.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for affirming Christ's authentic human emotions within orthodox Christology.
 - As a **polemic** against both impassibilist caricature and liberal/psychological denials of Jesus' genuine affectivity.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel emotion-passiages theologically (esp. compassion, sorrow, anger).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology and atonement discussions emphasizing Christ's sympathetic, sufferant humanity.
