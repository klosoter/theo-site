### TITLE
Aquinas on Human Action: A Theory of Practice (secondary study by Steven J. Jensen) - a systematic reconstruction of Thomas Aquinas on agency, moral formation, sin, and freedom

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Thomistic scholarship that reads Aquinas through the lens of virtue ethics, moral psychology, and analytic philosophy of action. Jensen aims to make Aquinas's account tractable for modern debates about agency, moral responsibility, and practical reason.
 - Primary texts: Thomas Aquinas, principally the Summa Theologiae (I-II, II-II), De Malo, and relevant Aristotelian sources; conversation partners include Aristotle, Augustine, and modern commentators (virtue ethicists and analytic philosophers).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas presents a unified *theory of practice*: human action is intelligible only as integrated activity of intellect, will, appetites, and habituated dispositions ordered toward a perceived good (beatitude). Sin and freedom must be interpreted within this teleological, psychological, and moral-habitual framework.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs the faculties: distinguishes intellect (speculative and practical), will (rational appetite), and sensual appetites; stresses the primacy of practical reason in action.
 - Shows how deliberation, counsel, and electio (choice) operate: the intellect presents ends and means; the will moves toward the perceived good; choice presupposes prior deliberative assent.
 - Integrates habit theory: virtues/vices are stable inclinations that shape perception of goods and thereby freedom; moral formation is practice-oriented.
 - Diagnoses sin and moral culpability: sin as privation or disorder of love; voluntariness depends on knowledge and consent, with vincible/invincible ignorance and coercion as modifiers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas and Aristotle; interlocution with Augustine on will and sin; contemporary interpreters (e.g., Anscombe, MacIntyre, Finnis) and analytic action-theory.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Human action and moral psychology; will and freedom; virtue and vice (habitus); sin (malice, privation); culpability and voluntary/involuntary acts; teleology (final end, beatitude).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Jensen reads Aquinas as offering a teleologically ordered, psychologically realistic account of practice in which freedom is constituted by right-ordered appetitive rationality and sin is a disordered habituation that diminishes genuine practical freedom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames Aquinas explicitly as a *theorist of practice* (not merely a doctrine-builder): action emerges through lived dispositions and practical reasoning, not only isolated choices.
 - Highlights the constitutive role of *habits* in shaping both perception of goods and moral responsibility - habits mediate freedom, not merely follow it.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against reductive voluntarist readings that separate will from cognitive structure; insists will is a rational appetite dependent on how the intellect presents goods.
 - Counters readings that treat Aquinas as primarily legalistic; Jensen emphasizes moral psychology and formation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys contemporary language of "practice theory" to capture Aquinas's integration of deliberation, habituation, and socially embedded activity.
 - Rearticulates medieval categories (interior act, habit, voluntas) in analytic-friendly terms (intentionality, disposition, capacity).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful across moral theology, philosophical ethics, and analytic Thomism; cited in discussions of virtue formation, moral responsibility, and natural law ethics.
 - Limited direct influence in Reformed circles but serves as a careful resource for comparative treatments of sin and freedom.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how freedom and culpability are rooted in embodied, habitual, and rational life; valuable for teaching moral psychology, pastoral theology, and ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Actus humanus / human action** - intentional actions as products of integrated faculties, not mere bodily motions.
- **Practical reason (ratio practica)** - the intellective power that judges means toward ends; central in producing deliberation and counsel.
- **Will (voluntas) / rational appetite** - the appetitive faculty that responds to perceived goods; not sheer spontaneity but reasoned inclination.
- **Deliberation (deliberatio) and choice (electio)** - deliberation discerns means; electio is the interior assent that issues in choice and external act.
- **Habit (habitus)** - stable dispositions (virtues/vices) that shape perception of goods and predispose actions; mediates freedom.
 - Virtue: habit ordering appetites to the true good.
 - Vice: habit disordering love, narrowing perceived goods.
- **Sin (peccatum) as privation/disorder** - moral malady: misdirected love or malice; understood teleologically as failure to order toward beatitude.
- **Voluntariness / voluntarius** - moral quality depending on knowledge and consent; contrasts with involuntary (ignorance, compulsion).
- **Vincible vs. invincible ignorance** - culpability depends on whether ignorance was avoidable.
- **Concupiscence / disordered appetite** - affective tendencies that, if habituated, impair judgment and voluntariness.
- **Interior vs. exterior act** - interior act (intention, consent) grounds moral species of the exterior act; culpability attaches to interior act.
- **End / finis (beatitude)** - final end shapes moral evaluation; disordered ordering of ends constitutes sin.
- **Moral responsibility (culpa)** - determined by knowledge, consent, and habituation; practices can diminish or increase freedom.
- **Practical formation** - pedagogical dimension: moral change occurs through practiced action and habituation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Aquinas's integrated account of action, habit, and culpability.
- As an **exegetical model** when reading Aquinas into contemporary debates on free will, virtue formation, and moral responsibility.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in comparing Thomistic and modern accounts of sin (privational teleology vs. voluntarist or purely psychological models).
