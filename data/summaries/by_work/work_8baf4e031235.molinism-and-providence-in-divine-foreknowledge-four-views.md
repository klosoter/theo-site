### TITLE
Molinism and Providence - Paul Helm (in Divine Foreknowledge: Four Views)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published within a late 20th-century edited volume surveying alternatives on divine foreknowledge. Helm writes from a Reformed/Calvinist philosophical-theological perspective and engages contemporary analytic debates about knowledge, freedom, and providence.
 - Milieu: post-Plantinga/Plantingian free-will theism, renewed interest in Molina among analytic philosophers (William Lane Craig et al.), and ongoing Reformed concerns about sovereignty and divine simplicity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Molinism (middle knowledge) is an inadequate account of God's providence because it compromises the classical doctrines of divine sovereignty, simplicity, and the priority of God's decretive will by making God's choice dependent on counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Molinism: the claim that God knows what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (scientia media), and that God actualizes a world by choosing among such counterfactuals.
 - Critical moves:
 - **Priority and dependence**: If God selects a world on the basis of counterfactuals, then the content of God's providential action is explanatorily dependent on creatures - this threatens divine sovereignty.
 - **Grounding problem**: Questions whether counterfactuals of creaturely freedom can have truth-makers independent of God's decree; if not, middle knowledge is either mysterious or collapses into other views.
 - **Theological costs**: Molinism conflicts with divine simplicity and immutability by introducing an explanatory order where God's will is responsive to creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Defense of an alternative: Helm favors a Reformed, decree-centered model of providence (compatibilist freedom) in which God's exhaustive decrees provide the proper explanatory priority for foreknowledge and providential ordering.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary targets: Luis de Molina (historical), and modern Molinists (notably William Lane Craig and other analytic defenders).
 - Conversant with Reformed and classical theistic resources (Calvinian notions of decree, divine simplicity), and with analytic literature on counterfactuals, the grounding objection, and libertarian freedom (Plantinga's work is backgrounded).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, foreknowledge, divine sovereignty and decrees, freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist), divine attributes (simplicity, immutability), the nature of counterfactual truth.

- **Closing line**
 - Helm's theological center of gravity: true providence preserves God's explanatory and decretive priority - any account (like Molinism) that makes God contingent upon creaturely counterfactuals undermines the classical Christian picture of God as sovereign, simple, and the primary cause of all that happens.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the **explanatory priority of God's decretive will** over any epistemic ordering based on creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Focus on **theological costs** (simplicity, sovereignty) rather than merely semantic or logical problems with middle knowledge.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts sharply with Molinists who present middle knowledge as preserving libertarian freedom and providence together; Helm argues this is a pyrrhic victory that trades away core aspects of classical theism.
 - Challenges modern analytic defenses by reframing the debate in theological, not only epistemic, terms.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reorients the debate from "can God know counterfactuals?" to "should God's providence be explained by such knowables?" - moves from epistemology to metaphysical/theological priority.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles as a concise, rigorous critique of Molinism; often paired with compatibilist defenses in foreknowledge anthologies.
 - Influential in prompting Molinists to clarify grounding accounts and respond to theological objections about divine simplicity and sovereignty.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact resource for theological students to see how metaphysical commitments about God shape debates about freedom and foreknowledge; useful for courses on providence and divine attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism** - The view that God possesses middle knowledge (scientia media) of what free agents would do in any hypothetical circumstance and actualizes a world accordingly.
- **Middle Knowledge (scientia media)** - God's knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, logically between natural and free knowledge.
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom** - Propositions about what free agents would do under hypothetical conditions; central to Molinist choice of the actual world.
- **Divine Providence** - God's governance and ordering of creation; for Helm, to be rightly understood in terms of divine decrees and causal priority.
- **Decretive Will** - God's efficacious, ordering will (the decrees) that for Helm must have explanatory primacy over creaturely possibilities.
- **Divine Sovereignty** - The doctrine that God is the primary and ultimate cause and determiner of all that comes to pass; Helm argues Molinism compromises this.
- **Divine Simplicity & Immutability** - Classical attributes threatened (in Helm's judgment) if God's decisions are explained by antecedent contingent truths about creatures.
- **Grounding Objection** - The challenge of explaining the truth-makers for counterfactuals of freedom independent of divine decree.
- **Compatibilist vs Libertarian Freedom** - Helm is sympathetic to compatibilist understandings that allow human responsibility within God's decretive causation; contrasts with Molinist libertarianism.
- **Actualization of a World** - In Molinism, God chooses which set of counterfactual truths to instantiate; Helm insists actualization must be grounded in God's decree, not vice versa.
- **Explanatory Priority** - Who or what provides the ultimate explanation for why things are the way they are; central heuristic in Helm's critique.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Polemic** - Standard Reformed critique of Molinism in debates over foreknowledge, providence, and predestination.
- **Conceptual pivot** - Shifts interlocutors from technical semantics of counterfactuals to theological commitments about divine priority and attributes.
- **Teaching / systematic theology** - Employed as a compact statement defending decree-centered providence and highlighting theological costs of middle knowledge.
