### TITLE
The Bondage and Liberation of the Will in the Reformed Tradition (in After Calvin) - Richard A. Muller

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid- to late-20th/early-21st century historical-theological recovery; essay appears in After Calvin, a collection probing post-Calvin Reformed theological developments. Muller's method is historical-systematic: close primary-source reading of early Reformed writers and later scholastics within their intellectual and ecclesial contexts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reformed theology consistently affirms a doctrine of the will that denies libertarian self-determination after the Fall while nonetheless upholding human responsibility and the necessity of efficacious divine grace for liberation. Muller argues that this position is coherent, historically continuous with Augustinian precedent, and more nuanced than common caricatures.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Reconstructs how key Reformed figures (Calvin, Beza, Vermigli, later scholastics) framed the will's bondage after the Fall.
 - Distinguishes between kinds of inability (moral vs. physical, natural vs. civil) and binds these distinctions to pastoral and doctrinal practice (conversion, election, calling).
 - Traces the development of doctrines of efficacious or operative grace that effect the will's liberation without abolishing responsibility or the will's nature.
 - Situates Reformed compatibilism against Arminian and Roman Catholic alternatives, correcting modern misreadings.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (as background), John Calvin (primary), Theodore Beza, Peter Martyr Vermigli, Reformed scholastics (Perkins, Gomarus/Amyraut debates), Arminius and Arminians, selective engagement with Lutheran and Roman Catholic positions and with Erasmus/Luther debates on free will.
- **Doctrines treated:** sin and human nature (original sin), free will and moral responsibility, grace (prevenient vs. efficacious distinctions), regeneration and effectual calling, predestination, conversion, theological anthropology.
- **Closing line:** The Reformed tradition articulates a historically grounded, Augustinian-compatible doctrine: the will is genuinely bound by sin and yet truly liberated by sovereign, efficacious grace - a balance that preserves divine sovereignty and human accountability without resort to libertarian voluntarism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasis on fine-grained historical distinctions used by Reformers (moral inability, natural impotence, subjective inclination) rather than modern binary categories.
 - Stress on the experiential and pastoral dimensions of "liberation": regeneration as an internal, efficacious act that transforms inclinations rather than merely removing external impediments.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects caricatures that depict Reformed doctrine as fatalistic determinism or as denying human responsibility.
 - Contrasts Reformed compatibilism with Arminian insistence on libertarian freedom and with Roman Catholic models of cooperation and prevenient grace.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recuperation of scholastic idioms (potentia, libertas, necessitas moralis) to explain Reformed positions without anachronistic projections.
 - Distinguishes modes of divine action: external call vs. internal efficacious operation (operative/operative grace language as explanatory tool).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential among historians of Reformation and Reformed theology for clarifying continuities with Augustine and for challenging oversimplified polemics.
 - Used by systematicians to ground contemporary Reformed treatments of grace, calling, and conversion.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models historically sensitive theology-writing: how to read theological systems on their own terms.
 - Provides a pedagogical corrective in teaching sin and will: clarifies vocabulary and pastoral implications for preaching on conversion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Bondage of the will:** The post-Fall condition wherein human will is inclined and constrained by sin, unable to effect saving good apart from divine grace.
- **Liberation (of the will):** The sovereign, efficacious work of God (regeneration/effective calling) that reorients desires and enables willing what is good.
- **Moral inability:** Incapacity to will saving good due to disordered affections and corruption - central Reformed description of postlapsarian human impotence.
- **Natural/physical inability:** Distinct category referring to literal incapacity (not the main thrust of Reformed anthropology).
- **Compatibilism:** The view that human volitions are determined by motives/affections yet remain responsible; Muller's reconstruction locates Reformed thinkers here rather than in libertarian freedom.
- **Efficacious/operative grace:** Divine grace that effectively changes the will and secures conversion, contrasted with merely resistible or external offers of grace.
- **External call vs. internal call:** Distinction between the outward proclamation of the gospel and the inward, effectual summons that results in regeneration.
- **Augustinian heritage:** The theological lineage that supplies categories (sin, grace, will) informing Reformed accounts; Muller stresses continuity rather than rupture.
- **Scholastic idioms (potentia, libertas):** Technical language used by Reformed scholastics to articulate degrees of freedom and necessity.
- **Affections vs. intellect/will:** Emphasis that the Reformed account locates bondage primarily in reoriented affections and appetites, which govern willing.
- **Predestination/election:** Doctrines connected to the theology of calling and liberation; used to explain why grace is effectual for some.
- **Effectual calling/regeneration:** The specific divine acts whereby the will is liberated and conversion occurs.
- **Responsibility and culpability:** The maintained Reformed affirmation that despite bondage, humans remain morally responsible for sin.
- **Prevenient grace (contrast):** Muller's reconstruction typically distances classic Reformed usage from Arminian-style universal prevenient grace that restores libertarian freedom.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on will, grace, and conversion in historical-theological studies.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with Arminian or Roman Catholic accounts, clarifying terminological and conceptual misunderstandings.
- As an **exegetical-model aid** for reading Pauline and Augustinian texts on sin and will within the Reformed interpretive tradition.
