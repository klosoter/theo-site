### TITLE
Karl Barth and the Problem of the Law-Gospel Distinction (ed. Bruce L. McCormack) - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early to mid-20th century Barthian theology, arising from Barth's critique of liberal Protestantism and reaction to Lutheran scholastic emphases. McCormack's editorial framing belongs to late-20th/early-21st-century Barth scholarship that recovers Barth's doctrinal development and situates his handling of law and gospel within his full Christ-centered dogmatics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reassess the classical Lutheran/Reformed law-gospel antithesis: Barth argues the distinction must be determined Christologically and theologically rather than as a merely methodological exegetical rule. The law is not simply the negative, Gospel the positive; both are forms of God's word whose proper relation is known only in Jesus Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - The law-gospel distinction arises only within the economy of revelation: law and gospel are God's word in different relational functions.
 - Christ is the decisive criterion: what is law and what is gospel is identified by Christ's person and work (Judge and Savior).
 - Law retains accusatory, normative and instructive roles but cannot be understood apart from the promise and fulfillment of the gospel.
 - Rejects a rigid dualism that isolates "law" as only condemnation and "gospel" as only forgiveness; insists on dialectical tension resolved uniquely in the event of Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Martin Luther and the Lutheran tradition (two-regiment formulations).
 - Reformed scholastic and Orthodox positions on normative law and sanctification.
 - Pauline exegesis (especially Romans and Galatians) and key biblical texts on covenant, promise, and command.
 - Contemporary critics of Barth: liberal theology, some pietistic readings that separate ethics from doctrine.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics), Christology (central), justification, sanctification, covenant, grace, law, promise, judgment, and the doctrine of God as Lord in history.
- **Closing line:** Barth reframes the law-gospel distinction so that it is a Christ-determined relation within God's one self-revealing word: law and gospel become intelligible only through the decisive person and work of Jesus Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Christocentric hermeneutic:** The distinction is not primarily hermeneutical technique but theological - identifiable only in relation to Christ.
 - **Dialectical unity:** Law and gospel are held in a productive tension rather than collapsed into a single category or separated absolutistically.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Revises Lutheran binary that tends to make law only condemning and gospel only redeeming; restores law's normative and pedagogical functions while refusing to let it claim salvific power.
 - Challenges any notion of natural theology that reads law as autonomous moral norm independent of revelation and Christ.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treats both law and gospel as **forms** of the divine word with function-determined roles within revelation.
 - Replaces purely methodological distinctions with ontological-theological categories tied to Christ's soteriological identity.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Central to neo-orthodox revival and 20th-century Reformed and ecumenical debate on justification and ethics.
 - Influenced subsequent Barthian interpreters (including McCormack) and shaped dialogues on justification after Barth, especially in disputes over imputation, covenant, and the role of good works.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a model for integrating biblical exegesis with systematic Christology.
 - Provides corrective against both legalism and antinomian tendencies in preaching and pastoral theology.
 - Remains a touchstone in contemporary debates on law, gospel, and justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law:** God's word as command, norm, and accusation; normative for human responsibility but intelligible only in relation to Christ.
- **Gospel:** God's promise and proclamation of forgiveness and new life in Christ; the revelatory center that determines the meaning of law.
- **Distinction (Law-Gospel):** A theological, Christ-determined relation, not merely an exegetical rule; an economy of God's self-revelation.
- **Christocentrism:** The hermeneutical rule that Christ's person and work govern interpretation of law and gospel.
- **Accusation:** The function of law to disclose human culpability and need for grace.
- **Promise:** The function of gospel that offers forgiveness and re-creation in Christ.
- **Revelation:** The event and history in which God discloses both command and promise; the arena where the distinction is constituted.
- **Justification:** The forensic and declarative act centered in Christ; Barth insists theological clarity about its relation to law and gospel.
- **Sanctification:** Ethical formation that follows from gospel; law retains pedagogical and normative influence without earning salvation.
- **Covenant:** Framework for understanding law and promise as God's relational dealings with humanity, read through Christ.
- **Dialectic:** Barth's method of holding opposites (law/gospel, judgment/forgiveness) in tension until resolved in Christ.
- **Hermeneutical rule:** Barth reframes this as theological criterion (Christ) rather than merely interpretive technique.
- **Forms of the Word:** Term for different functional modes (law, gospel) within God's singular word.
- **Natural law / autonomy:** Noted as problematic when severed from revelation and Christ; Barth resists autonomous moral theology.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for a Christ-centered, theological account of the law-gospel relation in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against dualistic or purely methodological law-gospel schemes in pastoral and confessional contexts.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot**: instructs Pauline interpretation and preaching that refuses to separate ethical command from soteriological promise.
