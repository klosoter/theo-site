### TITLE
N. T. Wright and the New Perspective on Paul (online essays and lectures) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed engagement with the resurgence of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Frame's material appears as online essays and lectures responding to N. T. Wright's popular and scholarly presentations (Wright's late 1990s-2000s work). The milieu is confessional Reformed critique of revisionist Pauline scholarship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Frame argues that Wright and NPP undermine the classic Reformation doctrine of **justification as forensic imputation** by reinterpreting Pauline rhetoric of righteousness and justification in covenantal/participatory terms. The doctrinal problem is whether Paul teaches legal declaration (forensic acquittal) or principally covenantal inclusion/faithfulness.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Expose Wright's redefinition of key Pauline terms (righteousness, justification, works of the law) as socioreligious/covenantal categories rather than legal-forensic categories.
 - Defend the traditional Reformed reading: justification = God's judicial declaration, grounded in Christ's active and passive obedience, with **imputation** (Christ's righteousness credited to believers).
 - Show how NPP's shift weakens sola fide and threatens assurance, penal substitution, and the forensic texture of the gospel.
 - Offer exegetical counterpoints to Wright on Romans and Galatians; appeal to systematic doctrine (atonement, covenant, soteriology) and classical confessions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** N. T. Wright (primary interlocutor), E. P. Sanders and James D. G. Dunn as originators/advocates of NPP; Reformed voices implicitly or explicitly drawn upon (Augustine, Calvin, Westminster standards).
- **Doctrines treated:** **Justification**, **forensic imputation**, atonement (penal substitution), covenant theology (works/grace distinction), Pauline soteriology, righteousness of God, law/Torah and "works of the law," faith and imputed righteousness.
- **Closing line:** Frame centers the debate on the necessity of preserving **justification as a forensic, imputed verdict** - arguing that without it, the gospel's legal relief and Christ's substitutionary work are doctrinally eroded.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm insistence that justification language in Paul must be read with legal categories and with the Reformation's vocabulary of imputation and forensic declaration.
 - Integration of philosophical-theological concerns (justice, guilt, verdict) with biblical exegesis; emphasis on normative doctrinal coherence over purely historical or sociological readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects NPP's move from forensic to primarily covenantal/participatory language by arguing that Wright understates explicit judicial metaphors and the functional role of imputation in Pauline argument.
 - Contrasts NPP with classical Reformed anthropology and soteriology that link justification to substitutionary atonement and assurance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Less innovation than reassertion: repackages Reformation categories for contemporary debate and highlights **forensic imputation** as the non-negotiable pivot.
 - Frames NPP's "covenantal nomism" readings as inadequate to account for Pauline antitheses (law vs. faith; works vs. grace).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited in conservative/Reformed critiques of Wright; used in seminary classrooms and online apologetics.
 - Provoked further debate; encouraged nuanced defenses of forensic justification and renewed exegetical responses to NPP proponents.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact, accessible model of confessional critique of NPP; valuable as a polemical primer and for clarifying why forensic categories matter doctrinally and pastorally.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP):** Movement reinterpreting Paul on law, works, and Judaism; emphasizes covenantal membership and social identity over forensic categories.
- **Justification:** Central contested term - Frame insists on **forensic declaration** (God pronounces sinner righteous).
- **Forensic imputation:** The doctrinal claim that Christ's obedience and righteousness are legally credited to sinners; Frame defends as essential.
- **Imputation vs. Participation:** Frame counters Wright's participatory language (union with Christ as primary) by arguing both are related but **imputation remains doctrinally decisive**.
- **Works of the Law:** NPP reads this as ethnic boundary markers; Frame allows that sense but insists Paul also opposes law-based merit that incurs condemnation.
- **Righteousness of God:** For Frame, retains legal/forensic sense tied to covenantal faithfulness and divine justice; resists reduction to purely covenant-membership language.
- **Covenant of Works/Grace:** Reformed schema used by Frame to locate justification within redemptive-historical promises and legal covenant obligations.
- **Penal substitution:** Atonement model affirmed and tied to imputation; Frame argues NPP risks sidelining substitutionary penal motifs.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral consequence emphasized - forensic declaration secures believer's assurance; loss of it threatens confidence in salvation.
- **Torah/nomism:** Frame critiques NPP's sociological emphasis (nomism) when it eclipses Pauline forensic critique of law's condemning function.
- **Pauline soteriology:** For Frame, must integrate justification, atonement, union with Christ, and the forensic verdict.
- **Works/Grace antithesis:** Maintained as doctrinally significant beyond mere sociological markers.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **polemic** resource defending Reformation categories against NPP revisionism.
 - As a **definition source** for terms like "forensic imputation" and for articulating pastoral implications of justification.
 - As an **exegetical model** showcasing how theological commitments shape readings of Romans and Galatians.
