### TITLE
Christology - Jürgen Moltmann, "Christology" in The Oxford Handbook of Systematic Theology (2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century systematic retrieval within a broad ecumenical handbook (2007). Moltmann writes from post-war German Protestantism, shaped by political theology, hope-eschatology, and theologies of suffering.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Affirmation of Chalcedonian Christology (one person, two natures) reframed: Christology must be read eschatologically and relationally so that the two-natures doctrine secures both divine and human reality without detaching God from suffering, history, and the world.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Classical metaphysical readings of Chalcedon risk abstracting the divine and insulating it from history and suffering.
 - Retrieval: Chalcedon is necessary as a boundary for heresy (Nestorianism, Eutychianism) but requires trinitarian and pneumatological framing to avoid static ontologies.
 - Reformulation: Christ's union is dynamic-rooted in kenosis (Phil 2) and consecrated by the resurrection-so that the divine person acts in history, shares creaturely destiny, and secures cosmic eschatological hope.
 - Application: Christology integrates with soteriology, ecclesiology, ethics and ecology because the incarnate Son determines God's relation to creation and future.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical: Chalcedonian Definition, Athanasius, Cyril of Alexandria, patristic formulations of communicatio idiomatum.
 - Modern: Barth (critical engagement), Pannenberg, Rahner, and contemporaries in Protestant social and political theology.
 - Scriptural anchoring: Passion-resurrection narrative, Philippians 2 (kenosis), Johannine and Pauline Christology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primarily Christology, with sustained attention to Trinity (relation of Son to Father and Spirit), soteriology (salvation as participation in Christ's suffering and future), eschatology (future-oriented vindication), and implications for creation and ethics.
- **Closing line**
 - Moltmann situates Chalcedonian fidelity within an eschatological, relational Christology: the one who is true God and true human is also the suffering, living, and future-making Lord of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Eschatological orientation:** Christology defined by future vindication (resurrection, parousia) more than abstract metaphysics.
 - **Suffering God:** Strong insistence that God in Christ participates in creaturely suffering - a corrective to impassibility.
 - **Relational/kenotic reading:** Hypostatic union described dynamically: the Son's self-emptying enables real human existence without metaphysical absorption.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that treat Chalcedon as primarily a metaphysical schema divorced from history; argues for a Chalcedon read through kenosis and resurrection.
 - Contrasts with classical ontological immutability (divine aseity) and with purely functional Christologies that deny ontological claims.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Moves vocabulary from static "union" language to dynamic idioms: "participative union," "eschatological solidarity," and "relational communication" of properties.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberation, ecological, and political theology; used by theologians who prioritize praxis and suffering. Criticized by some conservatives for perceived risks to Chalcedonian precision and divine impassibility.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust bridge between historic Christological orthodoxy and contemporary concerns (suffering, ecology, politics), making Chalcedon intelligible and theologically productive for modern theology courses and research.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Chalcedonian Definition**
 - The classical formula safeguarding one person in two natures ("without confusion, change, division, separation"); Moltmann affirms but reinterprets its implications.
- **Two Natures Doctrine (Dyophysitism)**
 - Christ as fully God and fully human; Moltmann insists on a real human nature that experiences suffering and history.
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Personal union of divine Word and human nature; read dynamically (kenotic, participatory) rather than as static mixture.
- **Kenosis / Self-emptying**
 - Central hermeneutical key (Phil 2): the Son's voluntary relinquishing of divine prerogatives to assume genuine human life.
- **Communication of Idioms (communicatio idiomatum)**
 - Moltmann stresses relational and functional communication shaped by resurrection and mission, avoiding reductionist transfers.
- **Suffering God**
 - Theological thesis that God in Christ participates in creaturely suffering - ethical and pastoral consequences follow.
- **Eschatological Christology**
 - Christ's identity is tied to future vindication and the transformation of creation; incarnation points toward eschatological consummation.
- **Relational / Participatory Ontology**
 - Emphasizes personhood and relation over substance-based metaphysics; union as participation rather than absorption.
- **Resurrection / Vindication**
 - The exegetical and theological center that confers lordship and secures the significance of kenosis.
- **Trinitarian framing**
 - Christology cannot be isolated from the Trinity; the Son's incarnation is interpreted within intra-Trinitarian relations and the Spirit's work.
- **Historic Jesus vs Christ of Faith**
 - Moltmann insists on continuity: the historical suffering Jesus is the Christ of faith who is vindicated and lord.
- **Cosmic Christ**
 - Christ's work reaches creation; soteriology has ecological and cosmic dimensions.
- **Theology from Below**
 - Approach prioritizing revealed action (God in history) over speculative metaphysics.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source:** Rescues Chalcedon from abstract metaphysics by providing an eschatological, kenotic reading.
 - As a **polemic:** Deploys against impassibilist and purely ontological Christologies; critiques theological approaches that sever God from suffering.
 - As an **exegetical-model/pedagogical pivot:** Models how to read New Testament kenosis and resurrection in systematic construction, linking Christology to ethics, ecology, and political theology.
