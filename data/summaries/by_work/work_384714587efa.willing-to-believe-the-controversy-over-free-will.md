### TITLE
Willing to Believe: The Controversy over Free Will - R. C. Sproul

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th century Reformed evangelical response to renewed debates over free will and responsibility. Written for pastors, students, and lay readers amid revived interest in Arminian/Reformed disputes, Molinism, and popular treatments of autonomy and autonomy-friendly ethics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Can fallen humans "will" themselves to genuine saving faith? Sproul argues that biblical freedom is compatible with divine sovereignty and that unregenerate humans are morally unable to come to God; faith is a gift of God (monergism) rather than a mere exercise of libertarian choice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Defines competing senses of "free will" (libertarian indeterminism vs. compatibilist freedom).
 - Surveys historical treatments (Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Arminius) and exposes philosophical and theological weaknesses in libertarian accounts when applied to fallen human nature.
 - Argues from Scripture for human moral inability (total depravity) and for divine initiative (regeneration, effectual calling).
 - Reconciles human responsibility with determinative divine sovereignty by appeal to compatibilist models of freedom and biblical categories.
 - Applies conclusions pastorally: evangelism, assurance, and pastoral practice do not negate the call to repent and believe; God uses means even when salvation is monergistic.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Luther (Bondage of the Will), Calvin, Arminius, Erasmus, modern Arminian writers, and historical Reformed commentators; philosophical interlocutors on free will and determinism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (regeneration, justification, effectual calling, irresistible grace), anthropology (total depravity, image of God), providence/sovereignty, human responsibility, and brief implications for ecclesiology and pastoral ministry.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** The theological center of gravity is that true saving faith is God-given and cannot be produced by an unregenerate human will - human responsibility and divine sovereignty are held together by a compatibilist understanding of freedom rooted in Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear advocacy for **compatibilist** freedom: freedom as acting according to one's nature/desires, not indifference between alternatives.
 - Practical insistence that monergism does not remove human culpability or the urgency of evangelism; calls to believe remain genuine means.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects libertarian readings that import modern metaphysical indeterminism into biblical anthropology.
 - Pushes back against Arminian appeals to "prevenient grace" as salvific synergy, arguing it undermines sola gratia if prevenient grace is treated as enabling by human assent.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes a pastoral vocabulary distinguishing "ability" (power to accomplish) from "moral ability" (willingness constituted by nature).
 - Stresses the experiential logic of regeneration preceding faith (faith as effect not cause).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as an accessible introduction to historic Reformed positions on will and salvation.
 - Critiqued by Arminian and libertarian proponents for understating human freedom's metaphysical claims; praised by Reformed teachers for clarity and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Concise, pastorally-oriented defense of classical Reformed monergism; useful primer for seminarians and pastors preparing sermons or classroom lectures on the will, repentance, and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Free will (libertarian):** the notion that true freedom requires the ability to choose otherwise in identical circumstances - Sproul critiques its coherence in a fallen context.
- **Compatibilist freedom:** freedom defined as acting according to one's nature/desires; upheld as biblical and coherent with divine sovereignty.
- **Bondage of the will:** the doctrine that sin enslaves the will so it cannot choose God without divine intervention (draws on Luther/Augustine).
- **Total depravity:** all faculties affected by sin, rendering humans morally unable to initiate saving faith.
- **Moral inability:** lack of internal willingness (not mere physical impotence) to choose God apart from regeneration.
- **Regeneration (monergistic):** the Spirit's sovereign work enabling faith; faith is the effect of regeneration, not its cause.
- **Prevenient grace:** Arminian category of grace preceding faith; Sproul critiques its sufficiency as enabling human choice without enabling regeneration.
- **Effectual calling / irresistible grace:** God's saving call that effectively brings the elect to faith; explained in compatibilist terms rather than mechanistic compulsion.
- **Synergism vs monergism:** cooperation of human will with God (Arminian) contrasted with God alone producing saving faith (Reformed).
- **Responsibility:** human accountability for unbelief retained even when libertarian alternatives are denied.
- **Foreknowledge & predestination:** biblical categories used to ground God's sovereign election while maintaining human culpability.
- **Means of grace / evangelism:** instrumental role in God's plan - Sproul holds that God uses preaching and callings even though the result is monergistic.
- **Pastoral implication (assurance):** assurance rests in God's sovereign work, not in a self-originating act of will.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **polemic** against Arminian/libertarian accounts of salvation and human agency.
 - As a **teaching/exegetical model** for interpreting texts that bear on election, calling, and human inability.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral courses to connect doctrine of sin, grace, and evangelistic practice.
