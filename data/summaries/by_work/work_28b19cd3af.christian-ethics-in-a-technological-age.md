### TITLE
Christian Ethics in a Technological Age - Brian Brock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2010; situated in postmodern/postsecular ethical debate about technology and moral formation.
 - Comes from contemporary Reformed/evangelical academic milieu (Brock: University of Aberdeen); bridges systematic theology, philosophical phenomenology of technology, and practical ethics.
 - Reacts to techno-optimism and purely consequentialist frameworks; converses with STS (science & technology studies), phenomenology, and virtue-ethics streams in theological ethics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern technologies are not morally neutral tools but *mediating structures* that reshape human practices, capacities, vulnerabilities, and moral communities; Christian ethics must therefore reconceive moral anthropology, virtue, and ecclesial practices in light of technological mediation.
 - Doctrine-problem: how to hold an incarnational, trinitarian, and sacramental anthropology that resists instrumentalization of persons while engaging technologies that reconfigure embodiment and social life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: identifies dominant moral vocabularies (consequentialism, autonomy, consumerist imaginaries) as inadequate for technological contexts because they ignore mediation and formation.
 - Theoretical move: adopts and adapts *mediating/phenomenological* accounts of technology (technology as milieu and prosthesis) to theological anthropology.
 - Theological resources: draws on incarnation, sacrament, creation, covenant, vulnerability, and eschatology to orient ethical reflection.
 - Practical moves: applies framework to issues (healthcare, biotechnology, disability, prosthetics, enhancement, information technologies), recommending practices, virtues, and ecclesial forms that cultivate human flourishing within technological environments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Philosophical/phenomenological: Don Ihde (mediation), Martin Heidegger (instrumentality and enframing), Hans Jonas (ethics of responsibility).
 - Ethical/theological: Alasdair MacIntyre (virtue and practices), Stanley Hauerwas (church-centered ethics), Dietrich Bonhoeffer (embodiment, discipleship), J. Moltmann (creation/eschatology).
 - Interdisciplinary: science-and-technology studies, disability studies, bioethics literature.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Anthropology**: embodied personhood, vulnerability, disability as theological category.
 - **Christology / Incarnation**: grounding ethical response in the embodied life of Christ.
 - **Trinity**: relationality and gift as paradigms for social and technological relations.
 - **Sacramentality & Ecclesiology**: church practices as formative counter-practices to technological subjectivities.
 - **Creation & Eschatology**: technology evaluated within covenantal stewardship and teleological hope.
 - **Sin / Ethics**: critique of instrumentalization, commodification, and autonomous self-fashioning.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Ethics for our technological age must be ecclesially grounded, incarnationally attentive, and oriented by practices and virtues that resist technological dehumanization while enabling flourishing within mediated human life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Technology as *moral mediator* rather than neutral background; attention to how technologies *shape capacities* (perceiving, remembering, relating) and thereby moral obligation.
 - Strong focus on **embodiment** and **vulnerability**-reading disability and prosthesis theologically to rethink personhood and flourishing.
 - Integration of *sacramentality* and *practices* into technology critique: the church's embodied practices form counter-formation to technological subjectivities.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Moves beyond Heideggerian doom-saying and techno-utopianism by offering constructive theological resources rather than mere critique.
 - Counters liberal individualist/technocratic ethics (autonomy, choice-first frameworks) by emphasizing relationality, covenant, and practice.
 - Offers a corrective to purely consequentialist bioethics by foregrounding formation and communal goods.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys "mediation" theologically: treating technologies as mediating moral perception and agency.
 - Recasts "prosthesis" as both threat and opportunity-prosthetic technologies reveal dependence and new forms of embodiment.
 - Frames technology as part of a moral *ecology*-networks of institutions, practices, and artifacts shaping virtues and vices.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in theological ethics, especially in work on technology, disability theology, and biomedical ethics.
 - Influential among Reformed and broader ecclesial ethics communities for integrating theological doctrine with STS and phenomenology.
 - Used in interdisciplinary curricula (theology + bioethics/STS), and cited in discussions about AI, enhancement, and health care ethics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for assessing emergent technologies via formation, practices, and ecclesial resources.
 - Serves as a bridge between abstract doctrinal commitments and concrete ethical deliberation about embodied technological life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technological mediation**
 - Technology shapes perception, agency, and social relations; ethics must attend to these mediations.

- **Embodiment**
 - Human personhood is fundamentally embodied; technologies that alter bodies raise theological-anthropological questions.

- **Vulnerability**
 - Vulnerability is normative for Christian anthropology and ethical attention; technology both exposes and mitigates vulnerabilities.

- **Prosthesis / prostheticity**
 - Technologies as extensions of the body that reveal dependence and reconfigure identity and capability.

- **Formation / practices**
 - Moral formation occurs through practices (liturgical, communal, vocational); technology influences formation trajectories.

- **Sacramentality**
 - Sacramental imagination provides counter-practices that resist technologized commodification of persons.

- **Covenant / stewardship**
 - Technological use evaluated within covenantal responsibility to creation and neighbor, not mere utility.

- **Moral ecology**
 - A networked view of institutions, artifacts, habits, and narratives that together shape moral life.

- **Instrumentalization**
 - Critique of treating bodies, creatures, and persons as mere means for ends; central sin diagnosis in technological contexts.

- **Virtue ethics (reconfigured)**
 - Emphasis on virtues cultivated within practices that negotiate technological affordances and limits.

- **Social imaginaries**
 - Technology participates in shaping cultural narratives about autonomy, enhancement, and progress.

- **Eschatological orientation**
 - Hope and telos inform ethical evaluation of technologies-do they participate in flourishing toward consummation?

- **Disability theology**
 - Uses disability as lens to rethink normalcy, dependence, and communal obligations in tech-saturated contexts.

- **Mediation theory**
 - Adopts phenomenological tools to trace how artifacts mediate human-world relations.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for theological accounts of technological mediation and embodied moral agency.
- **Polemic resource** against techno-utopianism, individualistic bioethics, and instrumentalization of persons.
- **Conceptual pivot** in curricula linking systematic theology (incarnation, sacraments) with practical ethics (biotechnology, AI, health care).
- **Exegetical model** for reading doctrines (incarnation, covenant, eschatology) as resources for concrete technological dilemmas.
