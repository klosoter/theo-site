### TITLE
What's at Stake in Current Debates over Justification? - Bruce McCormack (in Justification: What's at Stake in the Current Debates)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century debates over justification sparked by the "New Perspective on Paul" (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) and ecumenical conversations; McCormack writes from a Reformed-Barthian perspective seeking to clarify doctrinal stakes beyond exegetical skirmishes.
 - Theological milieu: Reformation retrieval vs. revisionist readings of Pauline soteriology; renewed attention to prolegomena (revelation) and natural theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - The contemporary debates are not merely historical-exegetical but fundamentally prolegomenal and doctrinal: defending the Reformation doctrine of justification as a **declarative, God-centered act grounded in revelation (analogia fidei)** is essential; appeals to natural theology (analogia entis) or to a primarily covenantal/participatory model undermine the Gospel.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: contemporary alternatives to classical forensic justification (notably New Perspective types) shift the locus of justification from God's declarative act to membership, covenant status, or ethical transformation.
 - Prolegomenon: theology must be disciplined by the **analogia fidei** (Scriptural self-revelation of God) rather than by analogies drawn from created being (analogia entis).
 - Theological defense: justification as a forensic/declarative act is anchored in the doctrine of God's righteousness and God's judicial acquittal of the sinner through Christ; imputation and declaration remain necessary categories.
 - Implications: to abandon forensic language or the priority of revelation produces doctrinal distortions-on sin, grace, assurance, and Christology-that affect ecclesial preaching and the gospel's content.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with Reformers (Luther, Calvin), Karl Barth (pro-analogia fidei), and contemporary interlocutors in the New Perspective (E. P. Sanders, N. T. Wright).
 - Draws on prolegomena discussions on natural theology vs. revealed theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic vs. covenantal), righteousness of God, imputation, faith (as trust and instrument), revelation vs. natural theology (analogia fidei vs. analogia entis), soteriology, ecclesiology (gospel proclamation), and assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - The debate ultimately pivots on how one construes theological method: defend justification as a revelatory, forensic declaration of God (analogia fidei) or risk reconfiguring the gospel around creaturely analogy (analogia entis) and losing the Reformation center.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Re-centers the dispute as a matter of prolegomena and theologia prima rather than merely exegesis; insists that methodological commitments (analogia fidei vs analogia entis) determine acceptable theological outcomes.
 - Explicitly Barthian insistence that revelation, not natural reason, governs doctrine of justification.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects New Perspective trajectories that redefine justification primarily as covenant membership or social status; presses that such readings conflate justification with sanctification or covenantal belonging and so dilute forensic declaration.
 - Contrasts with classical natural-theology-informed models that infer God's righteousness from created order.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tightens usage of "forensic/declarative" as non-negotiable to preserve the gospel's juridical character while acknowledging covenant language without subsuming the declarative act.
 - Recasts the debate as between two analogical principles (analogia fidei vs analogia entis) as the decisive hermeneutical fork.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among Reformed and evangelical defenders of classic justification; used as a clarifying, prolegomenal intervention.
 - Criticized by New Perspective advocates and some ecumenists who argue McCormack over-emphasizes prolegomena and underplays social or covenantal dimensions of Paul.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for prolegomena-focused courses, for clarifying why methodological commitments matter, and as a robust defense of the forensic center of the gospel for preaching and doctrinal instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification (forensic / declarative)** - God's judicial declaration of righteousness granted to sinners for Christ's sake; central category McCormack defends.
- **Imputation** - The forensic accounting by which Christ's righteousness is reckoned to believers; retained as necessary to explain declarative justification.
- **Righteousness of God** - Theocentric predicate: God's own justice and faithfulness, not merely human comportment; foundational to justification.
- **Analogia fidei** - Theology governed by God's self-disclosure in Scripture; McCormack's favored hermeneutical principle.
- **Analogia entis** - Appeal to analogy of being / natural theology; contested by McCormack as illegitimate grounding for soteriology.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - Cluster of scholarly positions (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) reinterpreting Paul's language of justification and covenant; primary interlocutory target.
- **Covenantal membership / covenantal nomism** - Alternative framing of justification as entry into covenant community; critiqued when used to replace forensic declaration.
- **Sanctification / justification distinction** - Affirmed as necessary: justification declared, sanctification lived; conflation is a key error McCormack diagnoses.
- **Prolegomena / theological method** - Priority of doctrine of revelation in shaping soteriological conclusions.
- **Declaration vs. transformation** - Distinguishes between God's legal verdict and the ethical/ontological change in the believer.
- **Assurance** - Linked to declarative justification; undermined if justification becomes merely relational or covenantal status without forensic content.
- **Barthianism** - McCormack's methodological kinship; stresses revelation and rejection of natural theology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **prolegomenal model** arguing that method (analogia fidei) must govern soteriology.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates with the New Perspective and ecumenical reinterpretations.
 - As a **definition source** for forensic categories (justification, imputation) in Reformed systematic theology.
