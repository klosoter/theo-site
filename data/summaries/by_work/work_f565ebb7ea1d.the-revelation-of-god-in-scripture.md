### TITLE
The Revelation of God in Scripture - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton orthodoxy; reaction to German higher criticism and liberal theology.
 - Warfield writes from a Reformed, confessional standpoint committed to supernatural, propositional revelation and the authority of Scripture.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the divinely ordained medium by which God objectively and intelligibly reveals Himself; this revelation is historically located, verbally communicated, and culminates in the economy of the Trinity disclosed in Christ and the apostles.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of special revelation over natural religion: God has not left Himself to mere human feeling or speculation but has spoken.
 - Defense of Scripture as the authoritative, divinely inspired record of that revelation:
 - Inspiration is **plenary** and **verbal**; Scripture is the self-attesting Word of God.
 - Revelation is propositional: God discloses truth claims about Himself and His acts which can be known and believed.
 - Historical-historicalism: revelation occurs in real historical acts (miracles, incarnation, resurrection) and in historically authored Scripture.
 - Progressive revelation and unity of Testaments:
 - The Old Testament contains preparatory and typological revelations that presuppose and anticipate fuller disclosure.
 - The New Testament explicates and completes revelation, particularly of the triunity of God in Father, Son, and Spirit.
 - Trinitarian disclosure: the doctrine of the Trinity is not extraneous speculation but the theological reading of the biblical witness - OT hints and NT explicit teaching cohere to disclose one God in three persons.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages German higher critics and theological liberalism (e.g., Schleiermacher's emphasis on religious feeling; historical-critical method).
 - Draws on Reformation and classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Augustine) for continuity in doctrine of revelation and Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), inspiration (plenary-verbal), inerrancy/authority of Scripture, Trinity, Christology (incarnation as decisive revelation), pneumatology, and the historical nature of God's acts.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's center of gravity: God has spoken in history and through Scripture in propositional, divinely-authored words that culminate in the revealed Triune life of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Uncompromising defense of **plenary verbal inspiration**: words as well as thoughts bear divine authorship.
 - Revelation is primarily **objective and propositional**, not merely existential or experiential.
 - Strong insistence on the **historical concreteness** of revelation (miracles, incarnation, resurrection) as anchors of divine disclosure.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Schleiermacher and liberalism: opposes reduction of revelation to subjective feeling or moral intuition.
 - Against purely rational natural theology: insists on special revelation that supersedes and corrects unaided reason.
 - Reacts to higher criticism by grounding authority in divine authorship and self-authentication of Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological marks**
 - Use of **self-authenticating** to describe Scripture's divine attestation.
 - Deployment of **propositional revelation** language to protect doctrine from relativistic or merely mythic readings.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for conservative Reformed and evangelical defenses of inerrancy into the 20th century; influential in fundamentalist-modernist controversies.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodox and liberal theologians who emphasize existential encounter (e.g., Barth's critique of propositionalism, though Barth also emphasizes revelation's primacy).
- **Enduring value**
 - Precise defense of Scripture's authority and a robust, historically anchored model of revelation that remains a touchstone in debates over inspiration, inerrancy, and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (special vs. general)** - God's self-disclosure in redemptive history (special) contrasted with natural knowledge of God (general).
- **Plenary inspiration** - Entire Scripture, in all its parts, is inspired by God.
- **Verbal inspiration** - Divine authorship extends to the words (not merely thoughts) of Scripture.
- **Inerrancy** - Scripture, properly understood, is without error in its teaching.
- **Self-authentication** - Scripture carries intrinsic divine attestation; its authority is not merely inferential.
- **Propositional revelation** - Revelation consists in true, knowable propositions conveyed by God.
- **Historical supernaturalism** - Revelation takes place in concrete historical events (incarnation, resurrection) witnessed in Scripture.
- **Progressive revelation** - Theological truth unfolds across redemptive history; OT prepares, NT fulfills.
- **Trinitarian revelation** - The biblical witness progressively reveals one God in three persons; OT hints and NT clarity form a coherent revelation.
 - Relation to OT: typology, angel-of-the-Lord, divine plurality as preparatory.
 - Relation to NT: Christ and Spirit provide explicit, economized disclosure of triunity.
- **Incarnation as revelation** - Christ is the decisive and final self-disclosure of God in history.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Scripture functions as the normative, divinely-appointed rule for faith and doctrine.
- **Polemic vs. experience** - Warfield uses objective revelation as polemic against experience-centered theology.
- **Canon and testimony** - The canonical corpus is the reliable record of God's redeeming speech.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative doctrines of inspiration, inerrancy, and propositional revelation.
- As a **polemic** tool against liberal, experiential, and laissez-faire critical approaches to Scripture.
- As an **exegetical-model** grounding Trinitarian theology in the unity of OT promise and NT fulfillment, useful in systematic theology and biblical theology courses.
