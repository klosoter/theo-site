### TITLE
**The Trinity Is Not Just for Trinity Sunday** - Fred Sanders (Christianity Today, 2017)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published in 2017 in Christianity Today, aimed at an evangelical readership and clergy; responds to contemporary tendencies in North American Protestantism to relegate the doctrine of the Trinity to liturgical formality or to avoid it altogether.
 - Situated in a broadly Reformed/evangelical theological milieu with engagement across popular and academic conversations about doctrine and devotion.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Trinity is not merely a liturgical or abstract doctrine reserved for one Sunday each year; the doctrine of God as Father, Son, and Spirit must shape the whole Christian life-worship, ethics, community, and mission. Sanders argues against the privatization or marginalization of Trinitarian theology.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: Many Christians treat the Trinity as peripheral or exclusively theoretical. 
 - Distinction emphasized: **Ontological Trinity** (who God is in himself) and **Economic Trinity** (who God is as he acts in history) must be in conversation; the doctrine cannot be reduced to a mere model for relations or to an abstract metaphysic. 
 - Constructive move: Show concretely how Trinitarian identity shapes prayer, church life, humility, mission, and the pattern of Christian relations. 
 - Practical claims: Trinitarian doctrine grounds Christian worship (we address Father, through Son, in Spirit), informs sacramental and communal practice, and resists individualistic or merely moralistic Christianity.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicitly draws on the historic Trinitarian tradition (Cappadocians, Athanasius, Augustine) and modern evangelical theology that has both neglected and reclaimed the Trinity. Also situates itself beside social-trinitarian emphases and critiques of non-relational ontologies.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Trinity (primary), with implications for worship, Christology, pneumatology, ecclesiology, and ethics (how doctrine informs practice).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - The doctrine of the Trinity is foundational to Christian identity and practice; it must be recovered as a living grammar for how Christians worship, love, and witness, not confined to a single Sunday on the church calendar.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence that Trinitarian doctrine is intrinsically practical: not merely a theological curio but a guiding framework for all Christian life. 
 - Balanced attention to both **ontological** and **economic** aspects-Sanders resists flattening the Trinity into mere interpersonal analogy or into inaccessible metaphysics.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects two errors: (1) the modern evangelical tendency to ignore or sentimentalize the Trinity; (2) the social-trinitarian move that risks projecting human relations directly onto God or losing the priority of divine being. 
 - Pushes back against treating the Trinity as optional doctrinal garnish or as a mere resource for social ethics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - No radical new technical vocabulary; rather, a re-contextualization: treating the **ontological/economic** distinction as a pastoral and practical hermeneutic for congregational life.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited among evangelicals as a succinct popular corrective encouraging renewed catechesis and preaching on the Trinity. Influential in prompting congregations and pastors to integrate Trinitarian language into regular worship and discipleship.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as an accessible bridge between patristic/academic Trinitarian theology and parish practice; useful for homiletics, catechesis, and curriculum that seek to recover formative doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinity:** God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; central focus of the piece as doctrine that shapes life and worship.
- **Ontological Trinity:** Who God is in himself (divine life, relations of origin); emphasized as the grounding reality that prevents reducing the Trinity to a convenient model.
- **Economic Trinity:** Who God is as he acts in history (creation, redemption, sanctification); emphasized as the arena where God's triune life meets human life.
 - Relation: Sanders insists these are distinct but inseparable-doctrine must honor both.
- **Perichoresis (relationality):** The mutual indwelling of the Persons; used to show how Trinitarian life models genuine relationality without reducing persons to roles.
- **Immanent Trinity:** Technical term for God's inner life; treated cautiously to avoid speculation divorced from God's works.
- **Practical/pastoral Trinitarianism:** The claim that Trinitarian doctrine must inform sermons, prayers, and church practices.
- **Worship formation:** How liturgy and prayer should reflect Father-Son-Spirit dynamics (address, mediation, presence).
- **Anti-reductionism:** Polemic stance against reducing the Trinity to an ethical exemplar or a purely metaphysical abstraction.
- **Doctrine-to-practice bridge:** The methodological posture: doctrine carries normative force for church life.
- **Social Trinitarianism (implicit interlocutor):** The modern emphasis on divine relationality as a model for human society-engaged critically where it flattens ontological priority.
- **Catechesis:** Use of Trinitarian instruction as formative for discipleship and identity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** in preaching and catechesis: concise, pastorally aimed articulation of why the Trinity matters weekly. 
- As a **polemic** against privatized or sentimental evangelicals who minimize doctrine. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in linking doctrine (Trinity) to ecclesial practices (worship, mission, community formation).
