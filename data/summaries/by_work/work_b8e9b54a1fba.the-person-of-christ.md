### TITLE
The Person of Christ - Graham A. Cole 
Contemporary Reformed evangelical treatment of Christology focused on the biblical, historical, and systematic articulation of who Jesus is and what his person means for redemption.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed-evangelical scholarship. Bridges biblical exegesis, patristic and Reformation resources, and contemporary systematic debate (kenotic theories, "Christology from below," modern liberal reductions).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Affirming a classical Chalcedonian Christology (one Person, two natures) as the necessary foundation for biblical soteriology: only the eternally divine Son who truly took a real human nature can accomplish atonement, mediation, and union with believers without either confusing natures or dividing the person.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Biblical-theological exposition of New Testament texts that speak to the Son's pre-existence, incarnation, human experiencings, death, resurrection, and exaltation. 
 - Systematic appropriation of patristic and Reformation formulations (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum, twofold office) to show continuity with the church's creedal heritage. 
 - Critical engagement with modern alternatives (kenoticism, functionalism, purely "exemplar" or "moral influence" reductions) showing their soteriological and doctrinal weaknesses. 
 - Practical / pastoral implications: union with Christ, mediation, priesthood, and the basis for assurance and sanctification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 Patristic writers (Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedon, Augustine; Reformers (Luther, Calvin); modern theologians and critics representing kenotic, existential, and social readings of Christ (e.g., select strands of Barth, Moltmann, contemporary critical scholarship).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Incarnation, Trinity (relation to the Son), hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum, atonement (substitutionary and representative models), union with Christ, resurrection and ascension, Christ as priest/king/head, covenant/federal headship.
- **Closing line:** 
 A robustly biblical and Reformed defense of Chalcedonian Christology that makes the person of Christ the indispensable hinge between Trinitarian doctrine and redeeming soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong integration of biblical exegesis with classical doctrinal formulations rather than a purely philosophical restatement. 
 - Emphasis on **covenantal and federal dimensions** of Christ's person - the Son as representative head in history. 
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Systematic critique of kenotic readings that sacrifice divine impassibility or omniscience in the incarnation. 
 - Pushback against reductionist social or ethical Christologies that make Christ primarily an example or social transformer rather than mediator who accomplishes objective redemption.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Nuanced deployment of communicatio idiomatum to safeguard both genuine human experiences and persistent divine properties without conflation. 
 - Clarifies relations between Chalcedonian categories and pastoral categories (assurance, union, sanctification) in contemporary speech.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary contexts as a concise, conservative corrective to popular but theologically thin Christologies. 
 - Cited in surveys of contemporary Christology and in evangelistic/pastoral treatments that require doctrinal precision.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clear exemplar of how to do biblically grounded, historically sensitive, and pastorally fruitful Christology for advanced students and ministers.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union:** One hypostasis (Person) of the Son with two distinct natures, divine and human - central doctrinal hinge. 
- **Chalcedon / Chalcedonian definition:** The classical formula Cole defends as the authoritative framework for Christological orthodoxy. 
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The two-way attribution of properties between natures in the one Person, deployed carefully to avoid confusion or division. 
- **Kenosis / kenotic theories:** Theories proposing voluntary divine self-emptying; Cole critiques versions that undercut divine attributes. 
- **Incarnation (enfleshment):** The Son's taking of real human nature - treated as historic, covenantal, and soteriologically necessary. 
- **Substitutionary atonement / representative obedience:** Christ's death as vicarious and representative - tied to his person as divine-human Mediator. 
- **Union with Christ (personal union for believers):** Doctrine showing how Christ's person mediates salvation, justification, and sanctification. 
- **Pre-existence / eternal Sonship:** Arguments for the Son's ontological priority and relational place within the Trinity prior to the incarnation. 
- **Mediator / High Priest:** Roles flowing from the Son's personal identity; ongoing intercession and session at the right hand. 
- **Two natures (dyophysitism):** Distinction of properties retained yet united in one Person. 
- **Person (hypostasis / prosopon):** Emphasized over mere functional or modal understandings; person is the decisive category for soteriology. 
- **Covenantal / federal headship:** How Christ represents humanity and secures covenant blessings historically and ontologically.
- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a *definition source* for conservative, Chalcedonian/Reformed Christology. 
 - As a *polemic* tool against kenotic, purely functional, or reductionist Christologies. 
 - As an *exegetical-model* linking NT texts on Christ to classical doctrine and practical pastoral theology.
