### TITLE
Living Faith: How Faith Inspires Social Justice - James Davison Hunter

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th-early 21st century Anglo-American evangelical and public theology debate. Hunter writes as a sociologist-theorist steeped in analyses of culture, institutions, and religion; he addresses a church negotiating postmodern pluralism, the culture wars, and renewed interest in social justice within evangelicalism.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Authentic Christian faith inherently motivates and shapes social justice when understood as vocation under the creation (culture) mandate; faith divorced from public vocation yields either privatized pietism or politicized triumphalism.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary faith often bifurcates into inward piety or partisan political activism; both fail to produce sustained social transformation. 
 - Theological resource: Recover the biblical doctrine of vocation and the creation/culture mandate as the normative frame for Christian social engagement. 
 - Social theory: Institutions and social structures require long-term, vocation-driven formation rather than episodic advocacy. 
 - Praxis: Faithful social justice arises when Christians practice formative disciplines in particular vocations, exercising dominion as stewardship, serving neighbor and common good. 
 - Implication: Church formation and public witness must reclaim shape-giving practices that orient believers to vocation and the common life.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Reformed antecedents: John Calvin, Abraham Kuyper (culture mandate, sphere sovereignty). 
 - Theologians: Dietrich Bonhoeffer (vocation, costly discipleship), Reinhold Niebuhr (critique of naive social optimism), and proponents of social holiness. 
 - Social-scientific interlocutors: institutional and cultural sociologists to show how practices shape public outcomes. 
 - Scripture: Particularly Genesis 1-2 (creation mandate), prophetic calls to justice, New Testament ethics of neighbor-love and discipleship.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Vocation** (calling of all Christians into social roles), 
 - **Creation/culture mandate** (dominion as stewardship), 
 - **Common grace** and providence, 
 - **Church/world distinction** and ecclesial formation, 
 - **Sin and structural injustice**, 
 - **Redemption and eschatological hope** informing present engagement.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 Faith that lives as vocation under the culture mandate forms people and institutions to pursue justice: faithful dominion, not merely politics, is the gateway to sustained social transformation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Centers **vocation** as the primary theological category connecting personal piety and public justice. 
 - Recasts **dominion** language as stewardship-oriented and formative rather than domination-oriented. 
 - Emphasizes long-term **institutional formation** over episodic policy wins.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against privatized pietism that reduces faith to personal morality. 
 - Also critiques triumphalist political Christianity that seeks coercive cultural control. 
 - Offers a middle path distinct from secular activist models (which rely on power) and revivalist models (which rely on conversion only).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - "Living faith" as a praxis-centered habitus shaping vocation and institutional participation. 
 - Practical redefinition of "dominion" within the culture mandate as formative stewardship.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Resonated with Kuyperian and neo-Calvinist streams emphasizing sphere sovereignty and cultural engagement. 
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a nonpartisan theology of social responsibility. 
 - Criticized by some for under-developing sacramental and communal ecclesiology necessary for sustained formation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a robust bridge between doctrine (vocation, creation) and social praxis (justice work). 
 - Serves as a corrective to both privatism and politicization in church practice. 
 - Useful in seminars on public theology, ethics of vocation, and Christian social witness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Vocation:** Universal calling; the primary lens for Christian social action. 
- **Dominion (stewardship):** Reinterpreted as responsible care and culture-shaping work under God, not domination. 
- **Culture mandate / Creation mandate:** Scriptural grounding (Gen 1-2) for human work and societal ordering; central hermeneutical touchstone. 
- **Living faith:** Faith embodied in practices that sustain justice across institutions. 
- **Common grace:** The theological basis for Christians cooperating with broader society to pursue common goods. 
- **Institutional formation:** The process by which churches and practices shape character and public order. 
- **Public faith:** Faith that speaks into public life without reduplication into partisan identity. 
- **Structural sin:** Systems and institutions shaped by sin that require vocation-shaped repair, not only individual repentance. 
- **Praxis:** Habitual, vocational practices that incarnate theological convictions. 
- **Prophetic witness:** Church's role in calling society toward covenantal justice without usurping cultural spheres. 
- **Two-kingdom language (qualified):** Distinguishes ecclesial and cultural roles while urging overlap via vocation. 
- **Neighbor-love:** Ethical engine for vocation-driven justice; practical expression of faith in public roles. 
- **Transformative sanctification:** Sanctification that effects social as well as personal renewal through vocation. 

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definition source** for a vocation-centered theology of social justice grounded in the culture mandate. 
- As a **polemic** against privatized faith and politicized Christian triumphalism. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on public theology, connecting Genesis-based mandates to contemporary institutional ethics.
