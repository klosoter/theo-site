### TITLE
Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect - Scott J. Hafemann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th/early 21st-century scholarly conversation: reaction to historical-critical sovereignty of German scholarship, emergence of canonical and redemptive-historical methods in anglo-American evangelical theology.
 - Engages renewed interest in integrating exegesis, history, and systematic theology amid debates sparked by Brevard Childs, Geerhardus Vos revival, and narrative/plot-focused approaches (e.g., von Rad, Brueggemann, N. T. Wright).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Biblical theology must recover a robust mediating role between historical-critical description and systematic theological construction, attending to the Bible's own storyline (promise-fulfillment) while respecting diachronic development and canonical shape.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of historical phases: early church typological readings, Vosian reformation, 20th-century fragmentations, canonical and narrative renewals.
 - Diagnosis: prior models either collapsed biblical theology into exegesis or abstracted it toward systematics, losing theological trajectory and canonical function.
 - Proposal: a methodological synthesis-retain historical development (diachronic), but read it within the canonical and Christocentric framework (synchronic/theological).
 - Practical implications: how to do OT theology that anticipates Christ; how NT interprets and completes Israel's story; methodological steps for exegetes and theologians.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Cites and critiques: Geerhardus Vos, Gerhard von Rad, Brevard Childs, Walter Brueggemann, N. T. Wright, and various proponents of canonical criticism and narrative approaches.
 - Dialogue with historical-critical scholarship and emerging evangelical methodologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (Scripture as coherent redemptive revelation), **covenant** (central organizing motif), **Christology** (fulfillment-focus), **typology**, **eschatology**, and the relation of OT/NT theologies to systematic formulations (doctrine of God, soteriology).
- **Closing line**
 - Biblical theology is best conceived as a disciplined, historically informed theological reading of Scripture that traces God's unfolding redemptive acts toward Christ within the canonical story.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on a balanced mediating role: neither reduction to historical description nor mere servant to systematic theology.
 - Emphasis on **promise-fulfillment** as the basic grammatical and theological shape of Scripture.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects approaches that treat biblical theology as purely diachronic history of ideas (e.g., some historical-critical models).
 - Challenges purely synchronic canonical readings that neglect historical development and Sitz im Leben of texts.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes the distinction between **diachronic (developmental)** and **synchronic (canonical/theological)** tasks in biblical-theological method.
 - Rearticulates **typology** as historically grounded and canonically normative, not speculative allegory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in evangelical and Reformed academic circles as a tempering, integrative voice; cited for methodological clarity in graduate classrooms.
 - Influential for authors and teachers seeking to bridge exegetical rigor and theological synthesis (e.g., course texts, study guides).
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a methodological corrective and pedagogical template: helps students perform theological readings that respect both historical provenance and canonical unity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - The discipline that traces the theological message of the Bible as a redemptive-historical whole.
- **Redemptive-historical / promise-fulfillment**
 - Framework viewing Scripture as an unfolding plan of God: promise initiated and progressively fulfilled in Christ.
- **Diachronic**
 - Attention to historical development of theological ideas across time (Israelite religion -> early church).
- **Synchronic / canonical**
 - Theological reading that attends to the final canonical shape and its theological message in Christian confession.
- **Typology**
 - Christ-centered correspondence between earlier events/persons and their fulfillment in Christ; historically grounded, canonically normative.
- **Covenant**
 - Central organizing theological motif to explain continuity/discontinuity between Testaments.
- **Christocentric reading**
 - Method that locates Christ as the climactic center of biblical theological interpretation without eisegesis.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity and discontinuity**
 - Dynamically assesses what is carried forward, transformed, or superseded in the movement from OT to NT.
- **Theological exegesis**
 - Exegesis that yields theological claims about God's acts and purposes, not merely literary-historical description.
- **Canonical criticism**
 - Focus on final form and ecclesial use of Scripture as shaping theological meaning.
- **Narrative approach**
 - Emphasis on Scripture's plot/ storyline as vehicle for theological content.
- **Fulfillment motif**
 - NT reading practice that shows how earlier promises find their consummation in Christ.
- **Old Testament theology / New Testament theology**
 - Distinct but related sub-disciplines that require integration via biblical theology.
- **Promise/typological continuity**
 - Explains how earlier covenants and types are fulfilled without collapsing diversity.

Uses across loci:
- Serves as a **methodological definition source** in courses on biblical theology and as a clarifying essay for students.
- Functions as a **conceptual pivot** in debates: defends a mediating, Christocentric, historically aware model against both reductive historical criticism and ahistorical systematics; used in exegetical modeling for sermons and theological syntheses.
