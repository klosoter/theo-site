### TITLE
Schleiermacher: Romans 9-11 (selected sermons and lectures) - on Romans 11 and Israel's future

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 19th century German Protestant context (post-Enlightenment, Romantic theology). Material appears in Schleiermacher's collected sermons and lecture notes delivered in Berlin and Halle; addresses a learned, pastoral audience negotiating pietism, rationalism, and confessional orthodoxy.
 - Theologically situated within Schleiermacher's larger project to reinterpret Christian doctrine in terms of religious consciousness and the feeling of absolute dependence.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to reconcile Paul's teaching about Israel's present stumbling with the divine fidelity to promises (Romans 9-11): the problem of election, divine justice and mercy, the relation of Israel and the church, and the eschatological hope that "all Israel will be saved."
 - Schleiermacher aims to preserve God's moral freedom and loving purpose while denying deterministic readings of election.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close reading of Paul's rhetorical logic in Romans 9-11, with pastoral application:
 - Romans 9: election cannot be reduced to ethnic nationality or arbitrary reprobation; election is rooted in God's covenantal will towards a people of faith.
 - Romans 10: gospel proclamation and the necessity of faith; Jewish unbelief arises from rejection of prophetic and Christological witness.
 - Romans 11: the remnant, grafting metaphor, and the future hope for Israel as evidence of God's unfailing mercy.
 - Key moves:
 - Reframe election as corporate/relational rather than metaphysical single‑person predestination.
 - Emphasize God's freedom and moral purpose - mercy governs God's action toward nations and Israel.
 - Interpret "all Israel shall be saved" as an eschatological promise conditioned by covenantal faithfulness rather than an abstract nationalistic guarantee.
 - Pastoral cautions: Gentile believers must humbly remember their grafting and avoid arrogance; active mission and moral witness are means toward the restoration of Israel.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Paul (primary exegete), the rhetorical context of Romans.
 - Implicit engagement with Reformed predestinarian readings (Calvin/Calvinism), contemporary rationalists, and emerging historical-critical exegesis.
 - Schleiermacher's theological interlocutors include pietist pastoral concerns and Enlightenment moral philosophy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election, covenant, soteriology, providence, eschatology (Israel's future), ecclesiology (relation of church and Israel), divine mercy and justice.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Schleiermacher reads Romans 9-11 as an assurance that God's covenantal will is morally free, merciful, and aimed at the restoration of a faithful communal people - interpreted ethically and eschatologically rather than deterministically.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Election reframed as communal and ethical: the elect are defined by faithful relation to God, not metaphysical fate.
 - Strong pastoral reading: Pauline theology becomes a corrective against Gentile spiritual pride and a ground for mission.
 - Emphasis on God's moral freedom and the purposive character of divine mercy.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against strict double predestination (Reformed determinism): Schleiermacher rejects fatalistic implications and preserves human responsibility.
 - Correction of rationalist reductions: retains historical-Christian promises (covenant, eschatological hope) while reinterpreting them through religious consciousness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses Schleiermacher's anthropological categories (feeling, dependence) to reframe Pauline promises and election.
 - Treats "remnant" and "all Israel" as theological-pastoral categories rather than purely ethnic or political terms.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberal Protestant interpretation of Paul and in modern historical-critical scholarship that emphasizes corporate election and eschatology.
 - Criticized by conservative confessionalists for perceived undercutting of forensic and forensic‑legal elements in soteriology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a temperate middle way between determinism and moralism; offers pastors an exegetical template for handling Pauline tensions regarding Israel and the church.
 - Useful as a hermeneutical exemplar for readings that prioritize communal faith, ethical consequence, and eschatological hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Election**
 - Corporate, covenantal election rooted in God's purpose for a faithful people rather than individual metaphysical predestination.
- **Remnant**
 - The faithful subset within Israel; proof of divine continuity and a seed for future restoration.
- **Grafted olive tree**
 - Metaphor read pastorally: Gentile inclusion does not annul Israel's place; warns Gentile humility.
- **Hardening / partial hardening**
 - Temporary judicial/historical phenomenon that allows Gentile mission; not ultimate exclusion.
- **"All Israel shall be saved"**
 - Interpreted eschatologically and conditionally - as the future vindication of covenant faithfulness, not immediate ethnic universalism.
- **Gifts and calling irreprovable (Rom 11:29)**
 - Evidence of God's steadfastness; grounds for hope and mission rather than determinism.
- **Divine freedom**
 - God acts morally free and purposively, not as a necessitated cause producing fixed outcomes.
- **Mercy and justice**
 - Central attributes shaping God's historical dealings with Israel and nations.
- **Faith / assent**
 - Active human response; necessary for inclusion in the elect community.
- **Covenant**
 - The theological grid for understanding promises to Israel and their continuity.
- **Eschatological fullness / consummation**
 - The telos toward which partial hardening and Gentile inclusion point.
- **Pastoral warning**
 - Gentile believers must avoid arrogance; live in humility and mission.
- **Religious feeling / dependence**
 - Schleiermacher's hermeneutical presupposition shaping interpretation of Pauline texts.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 9-11 that emphasizes community, pastoral intent, and eschatology.
 - As a **polemic** against deterministic readings of election and for a theology that preserves divine mercy and human responsibility.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in liberal theology to reconcile biblical promise to Israel with modern moral and historical conscience.
