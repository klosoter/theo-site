### TITLE
The Gospel Commission: Recovering God's Strategy for Making Disciples - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical milieu reacting to late‑20th/early‑21st century missional trends: seeker-sensitive programs, programmatic evangelism, therapeutic Christianity, and pragmatic church growth models. Horton writes as a confessional Reformed pastor‑theologian aiming to recover historic means of grace and catechesis for disciple‑making.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The church has misconstrued the Great Commission as a program for numerical growth or social transformation and thereby abandoned a gospel‑centered, covenantal, means‑of‑grace model for making disciples. Recovering God's ordained strategy (Scripture, sacraments, catechesis, preaching, church discipline) is necessary for faithful reproduction of disciples.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose: prevailing missional practices dilute the gospel by prioritizing cultural accommodation, programmatic techniques, or socio‑political agendas.
 - Theological reframing: place disciple‑making within covenantal and christological categories - the gospel is the center, and the church is the instrument.
 - Practical recovery: reassert classical Reformed practices (catechesis, covenant nurture, sacramental life, preaching, discipline) as the means God appoints to form disciples.
 - Ecclesial implications: local church responsibility, pastoral leadership, and congregational formation over parachurch or purely pragmatic enterprises.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** implicit engagement with modern missiologies and cultural engagement theorists (e.g., variants of Niebuhr's Christ and Culture typology), dialogue with contemporary evangelical practitioners, and appeal to Reformed confessions, Puritan catechetical practice, and Scripture as primary authorities.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (mission of the church), soteriology (gospel as proclamation and effectual call), covenant theology (household catechesis), sacramentology (means of grace), Scripture and preaching (Word as instrument), Christology (lordship of Christ over mission), eschatology (mission in light of final consummation).
- **Site usages (selected):**
 - **Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective:** Horton reframes the Christ‑culture debate by insisting eschatological orientation must temper both accommodation and triumphalism; mission is witness amidst already/not‑yet realities.
 - **Church And State Relations:** Horton distinguishes the church's gospel mission from political projects while urging Christians to live faithfully in public vocations; he resists reducing discipleship to a political program.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Authentic disciple‑making is a gospel‑centered, covenantal, ecclesial practice enacted by the church through God‑appointed means, not a technique or cultural accommodation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Reclaims catechesis (systematic instruction) as central to the Great Commission rather than optional discipleship add‑ons.
 - Prioritizes *means of grace* (Word, sacrament, discipline) as theologically constitutive for forming disciples.
- **Corrections / contrasts:**
 - Against seeker‑sensitive and pragmatic models: argues these substitute methods for means and displace the gospel with consumerist values.
 - Against purely social or political interpretations of mission: rescues proclamation and covenant nurture from reduction to cultural engineering.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Frames the Great Commission as a *strategy* given by God - intentional, means‑oriented, ecclesial rather than programmatic.
 - Emphasizes "making disciples" as a household and congregational practice (not merely individual decision moments).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and confessional evangelical circles as a corrective missional handbook; influential among pastors wanting concrete catechetical and liturgical recovery.
 - Cited in broader evangelical debates over mission methodology, sparking productive pushback from pragmatic church‑growth proponents.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a coherent theological alternative to technique‑driven mission practice.
 - Supplies practical steps rooted in confessional theology useful for pastoral formation, training programs, and seminary instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel Commission:** Horton's rephrasing of the Great Commission emphasizing God's ordained strategy and means.
- **Making disciples:** Not merely conversion; ongoing catechesis, formation in doctrine, obedience, and participation in church life.
- **Means of grace:** Word, sacraments, and discipline as divinely appointed instruments for producing faith and holiness.
- **Catechesis:** Systematic instruction (household and congregational) for forming disciples; central corrective to programmatic evangelism.
- **Covenant nurture:** Family and church responsibility for raising covenant children in the faith; contrasts with individualized decisionism.
- **Ecclesiology of mission:** The church as primary agent of disciple‑making, not parachurch programs or secular institutions.
- **Sacramental formation:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper as formative practices tied to covenant identity and discipleship.
- **Eschatological perspective:** Mission practiced with awareness of already/not‑yet - tempering triumphalism and accommodation (ties to Christ & Culture debate).
- **Cultural engagement:** Engagement that submits to gospel shape rather than conforming the gospel to culture.
- **Church‑state distinction:** Maintains theological separateness of church mission from political policy while affirming Christian civic responsibility.
- **Proclamation vs. program:** Distinguishes faithful preaching and catechesis from managerial, consumerist church programming.
- **Pastoral authority & discipline:** Use of church discipline and pastoral oversight as formative and corrective tools.
- **Household of faith:** The domestic and congregational context for disciple formation.
- **Formation over attraction:** Priority given to deep spiritual formation instead of marketing the church to seekers.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed approaches to mission and discipleship (seminary courses, pastoral training).
 - As a polemic and practical manual against pragmatic, seeker‑sensitive models and social‑only conceptions of mission.
 - As an exegetical and conceptual pivot for integrating catechesis, sacraments, and ecclesial practices into contemporary mission strategy.
