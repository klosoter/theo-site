### TITLE
Ulrich Zwingli: Selected Works, ed. Samuel M. Jackson - primary selections for Zwingli's sacramental, exegetical, and ecclesiastical writings (Swiss Reformation, early 16th century).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early Reformation Zurich (1519-1531) within the Swiss Reformation; engagement with humanist exegesis, patristic reading, and polemics with Roman Catholicism and Lutherans.
 - Jackson's edition collects Zwingli's sermons, disputations, and treatises that shaped Swiss ecclesial reform and sacramental practice.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Defend a non‑corporeal, covenantal understanding of the sacraments: sacraments are **signs and pledges** (arrha) of God's promise, not automatic channels that physically or metaphysically change the elements or convey grace apart from faith.
 - Regulate the Lord's Supper through **fencing and admission** to preserve the church's purity and the sacrament's meaning.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful readings of Scripture (notably 1 Corinthians, Luke) to deny transubstantiation and a corporeal bodily presence.
 - Theological claim: sacraments function as visible testimonies and seals of the Gospel promise; their effect depends on the word and faith rather than an inherent sacramental power.
 - Pastoral application: precise rules for who may receive communion (fencing the table), and the use of discipline to protect the covenant community.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Direct polemics with Roman Catholic sacramental theology and with Martin Luther (Marburg controversies) over the nature of Christ's presence.
 - Dialogues with Oecolampadius and other Swiss reformers; appeals to Scripture and selective patristic testimony.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology (Lord's Supper, baptism), covenant theology, ecclesiology (discipline, admission), Christology (presence of Christ in sacraments), soteriology (faith and assurance), authority of Scripture.
- **Closing line**
 - Zwingli centers sacramental life on the proclaimed Word and covenantal sign-act: the sacraments confirm the promise to the faithful and must be guarded by ecclesial discipline rather than imagined as independent channels of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Calls sacraments **signs and pledges** (arrha) - highlighting assurance and testimony rather than existential change in the elements.
 - Strong insistence on **fencing the table**: the church must determine admission to the Lord's Supper to preserve its covenantal integrity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Roman transubstantiation and the Lutheran notion of the bodily or "ubiquitous" presence; opposes any understanding that treats sacraments as ex opere operato instruments.
 - Contrasts with more radical reformers (Anabaptists) by retaining infant baptism and structured discipline.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frequent use of the **pledge/arrha** language to reframe sacramental efficacy as assurance given, not a magical conveyance of grace.
 - Systematic linking of **preaching + sacrament + discipline** as an integrated covenantal economy.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on Swiss and later Reformed polity and sacramental vocabulary; served as a foil for Lutheran sacramental theology at Marburg.
 - Provided a durable model for memorialist or symbolic readings of the Lord's Supper in Reformed circles, though Calvin modified Zwingli's spiritual presence language.
- **Enduring value**
 - Zwingli remains indispensable for understanding covenantal, ecclesiastical, and disciplinary dimensions of Reformed sacramental practice and for exegetical approaches to 1 Corinthians and Luke.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper** - central sacrament discussed; for Zwingli a covenantal meal that testifies to Christ's promise rather than a locus of physical presence.
- **Presence of Christ** - denied as corporeal; affirmed as real in a spiritual/proclamatory sense linked to the Word and faith.
 - Contrast: rejects transubstantiation and Luther's physical/spiritual union; favors "spiritual reception" by faith.
- **Fencing the Table** - ecclesial practice of restricting communion to those who meet covenantal requirements; disciplinary safeguard.
- **Admission** - criteria and processes for allowing communicants; connected to catechesis and public profession.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Pledges (arrha)** - sacraments function to seal the promise and provide assurance, not to transmit grace automatically.
- **Means of Grace** - Zwingli limits the category: sacraments accompany the Word and confirm promise; they are not instrumental causes independent of faith.
- **Ex opere operato** - explicitly rejected; sacraments do not work by mere rite apart from the faith engendered by the Word.
- **Word and Sacrament relation** - proclamation is primary; sacraments are subordinate confirming signs.
- **Covenant** - sacramental economy understood through covenant imagery: sign, pledge, and confirmation of the divine promise to the faithful.
- **Memorialism** - Zwingli's emphasis on remembrance and testimony in the Supper, though he allows a real spiritual benefit for believers.
- **Church Discipline** - institutional enforcement (admission, admonition, exclusion) to maintain visible covenant faithfulness.
- **Spiritual Presence** - presence of Christ experienced by faith under the Word rather than a local or material inhabiting of the elements.
- **Pneumatic Reception** - the idea that the Holy Spirit unites the believer to Christ at the sacrament through faith rather than by element change.
- **Seal/Arrha vocabulary** - theological jargon that reshapes later Reformed sacramental categories.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed memorial/pledge views of sacraments and for early Reformed ecclesial discipline.
 - As a **polemic resource** against medieval sacramentalism and Lutheran sacramental ontology (Marburg context).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians and Luke with pastoral/disciplinary implications.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching covenant theology, linking sacrament, word, and congregational order.
