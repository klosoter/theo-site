### TITLE
Worship: Reformed According to Scripture - Hughes Oliphant Old

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed liturgical renewal; Oliphant Old (Presbyterian historian and minister) writes from confessional Reformed commitments and pastoral-liturgical concerns.
 - Moves between historical-liturgical scholarship and practical theology for contemporary Reformed churches.

- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed worship, properly ordered by Scripture and the confessions, centers on the covenantal Word and sacraments as the principal **means of grace**, shaped by a regulative principle that secures both continuity with the Reformation and pastoral integrity in the church's life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological exposition of Reformed worship formularies and practices (Patristic, Medieval, Reformation, Puritan, and Confessional eras).
 - Biblical-theological grounding: worship flows from revelation (Word), covenant structure, and Christ's mediatorial presence.
 - Pastoral and rubrical application: preaching, sacraments, prayer, and discipline (including fencing and admission to the Lord's Supper).
 - Two explicit topical treatments used here:
 - **Lord's Supper - Presence of Christ; Fencing and Admission**: argues for a Reformed understanding of Christ's spiritual, real presence and defends disciplined admission rooted in covenant membership and pastoral oversight.
 - **Means of Grace - Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer**: treats preaching, sacraments, and prayer as ordered channels whereby Christ communicates covenant blessings to the church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Calvin, Zwingli, Bucer, Knox, the Puritans, Westminster Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and continental Reformed liturgies; converses with Roman Catholic and Lutheran sacramental positions and with later pietistic and revivalist currents.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word), Covenant theology, Christology (mediatorial presence in worship), Sacramental theology, Ecclesiology, Regulative Principle of Worship, Prayer, Preaching as formative means of grace, Church discipline.

- **Closing line**
 - Worship is the covenantal, Scripture-governed encounter in which Word and sacraments-administered with pastoral order and confessional fidelity-mediate Christ's presence and grace to his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates rigorous historical liturgy with normative theology: not merely history of worship but prescription shaped by Scripture and confessional standards.
 - Strong pastoral concentration on **fencing the table** and admission practices as theological and ecclesial safeguards, not merely disciplinary relics.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both:
 - Loose, consumerist or purely experiential worship that downplays covenantal order.
 - Over-sacramentalized models (Roman or medieval ubiquity claims) and reductionist memorialism; advocates a Reformed "spiritual real presence."
 - Reclaims the centrality of preaching as an indispensable, sacramental-like means (though not transubstantive).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuances the language of "means of grace" to include prayer and ordered corporate forms alongside preaching and sacraments, treating them as integrated channels rather than discrete utilities.
 - Revitalizes the phrase "fencing the table" in contemporary pastoral lexicon as theologically necessary.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in Reformed seminaries and Presbyterian circles; influential for liturgical renewal and catechetical formation.
 - Used by pastors and worship committees seeking historically informed, confessional reform rather than mere stylistic change.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as both a scholarly synthesis and a practical manual: durable for teaching Reformed worship theology and for guiding church practice in sacrament, preaching, prayer, and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regulative Principle of Worship**
 - Worship elements must be instituted by Scripture; frames Oliphant Old's prescriptive commitments.

- **Means of Grace**
 - Primary channels: **preaching**, **sacraments**, **corporate prayer**; integrated as covenantal conduits of Christ's blessing.

- **Word and Sacrament**
 - Mutual, complementary centers of Reformed worship; preaching as the Word, sacraments as visible seals.

- **Covenant**
 - The organizing theological grid: worship as covenantal encounter and covenant renewal.

- **Presence of Christ (Lord's Supper)**
 - Articulated as a **spiritual, real presence** that is objective and efficacious without corporeal ubiquity.

- **Fencing the Table**
 - Pastoral practice of admission and discipline to safeguard covenant integrity and catechetical preparedness.

- **Admission to Communion**
 - Admission tied to baptismal/covenant membership, catechesis, and pastoral oversight.

- **Preaching as Means**
 - Preaching treated as sacramental-like in function: formative, declarative, and instrumental for grace.

- **Sacramental Efficacy**
 - Efficacy grounded in Christ's promise and Spirit-wrought application, not in priestly power or mere sign.

- **Liturgical Order**
 - Stress on structure, rubrics, and congregational participation as theological forms, not mere ceremony.

- **Confessionalism**
 - Use of Reformed confessions as normative interpretive guides for worship practice.

- **Puritan influence**
 - Selective retrieval of Puritan formative practices (catechesis, psalmody, discipline) for modern use.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed worship theology (means of grace, regulative principle, covenantal framing).
 - As an **exegetical-historical model** for sacramental theology and liturgical reform (Lord's Supper presence; fencing/admission).
