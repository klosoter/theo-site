### TITLE
Faith, Hope, and Love in the Christ-Follower - Craig S. Keener

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical New Testament scholarship; Keener writes as a pastorally-minded exegete who bridges academic philology, social-historical background, and practical theology.
 - Positioned within late 20th/21st-century conversations about virtue, spiritual formation, and biblically grounded ethics.

- **Central thesis**
 - The classical theological virtues - **faith, hope, and love** - are best understood as interdependent, Christ-centered dispositions formed by the Spirit in the life of the disciple and rooted in Biblical narrative, not as abstract moral ideals or merely personal piety.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Pauline, Johannine, and general epistle texts where the three virtues are thematized.
 - Historical-theological framing: traces Jewish and Greco-Roman uses of pistis/elpis/agape to clarify distinctively Christian meanings.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a triadic account in which
 - **Faith** is fidelity/trust in Christ (relational and covenantal),
 - **Hope** is eschatologically anchored confidence that shapes present praxis,
 - **Love** is the constitutive ethic of the community and Christlike self-giving.
 - Pastoral application: shows how these virtues shape discipleship, church life, and ethical witness.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with New Testament texts; interaction with Second Temple Judaism and Greco-Roman moral language.
 - Dialogues implicitly with virtue-ethics streams, patristic treatments of charity, and contemporary scholars who emphasize either doctrinal fidelity (doctrine-first) or practice-first Christian living.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ethics/virtue, Christology (as source and model of virtues), Pneumatology (Spirit as formative agent), Ecclesiology (virtues formed in community), Soteriology (faith and justification as relational), Eschatology (hope as future-directed), and implicit Trinitarian concerns (God as ground of these virtues).

- **Closing line**
 - Keener's theological center of gravity: the three virtues function as Spirit-formed, Christ-shaped habits that integrate belief, destiny, and neighbor-love into the life of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong exegetical attention to first-century linguistic and social context to retrieve the lived meaning of pistis/elpis/agape.
 - Emphasizes communal formation: virtues are transmitted and sustained within the ecclesial practices rather than as isolated dispositions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely pietistic or voluntaristic readings that privatize the virtues.
 - Counters Hellenizing reductions that convert agape to sentiment or elpis to mere optimism; resists moralistic-therapeutic approaches that detach virtues from Christ and eschatology.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Frames the triad as an interlocking practice-system: **faith as covenantal fidelity**, **hope as eschatological stamina**, **love as communal embodiment** - each defined in relational and narrative terms rather than abstract categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely usable in evangelical seminaries and congregational formation; appeal to pastors and teachers who want exegetical grounding for spiritual formation.
 - Cited across theological outlines as a bridge resource between New Testament exegesis and practical theology; modest uptake in Reformed circles for its exegetical clarity and pastoral orientation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for linking biblical exegesis with discipleship curricula.
 - Serves as a corrective to both doctrinal abstraction and ethical reductionism by keeping Christ and Spirit central.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pistis (Faith)** - relational trust/fidelity to Christ and covenantal commitment; not merely assenting to propositions.
- **Elpis (Hope)** - eschatological confidence that shapes present endurance and mission.
- **Agape (Love)** - self-giving, covenantal love that constitutes the church's moral identity.
- **Virtue ethics (Christian register)** - virtues as habits formed by practice within community and narrative.
- **Christocentric formation** - virtues rooted in the person and work of Christ as exemplar and source.
- **Pneumatological formation** - the Spirit as agent who cultivates these virtues in believers.
- **Ecclesial praxis** - church practices (worship, sacraments, mutual care) as formative contexts for the virtues.
- **Covenant fidelity** - reading faith as loyalty within a covenantal framework rather than abstract belief.
- **Eschatological orientation** - hope reshapes present ethics by reference to God's future act.
- **Communal anthropology** - human flourishing understood relationally; virtues are social and ecclesial.
- **Exegetical retrieval** - method: careful lexical, social-historical study to recover first-century meanings.
- **Anti-moralism** - avoids reducing virtues to legalistic checklists; integrates grace and formation.
- **Pastoral application** - concrete link to discipleship, spiritual practices, and congregational formation.
- **Theological virtues (classical appropriation)** - reframes traditional trio in NT categories rather than purely scholastic terms.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical accounts of faith, hope, and love grounded in NT exegesis.
- As a **polemic** against privatized or moralistic forms of spirituality that sever virtues from Christ and community.
- As an **exegetical model** for linking lexical study with pastoral theology and spiritual formation.
