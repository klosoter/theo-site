### TITLE
**Kinds of Biblical Theology** - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal (2000)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in 2000 in the Westminster Theological Journal amid renewed evangelical interest in redemptive-historical and canonical approaches (Vo sian and Klinean streams, Brevard Childs' canonical work, Goldsworthy-style Christocentrism).
 - Poythress writes as a Reformed scholar conversant with analytic philosophy, Vosian historical theology, and contemporary debates about method in biblical theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Biblical theology is not a single discipline with one method but a family of distinct "kinds" with different aims and rules; recognizing these kinds clarifies disputes over authority, method, and the relation of biblical theology to systematic theology.
 - Problem addressed: debates that collapse diverse projects (e.g., redemptive-historical, canonical, thematic) into one, producing category errors and polemical overreach (e.g., claims about Mosaic covenant or intrusion ethics).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Taxonomy: Poythress distinguishes multiple kinds (descriptive/historical, synthetic/thematic, canonical, theological-systematic uses of biblical theology) and shows how they differ in scope, normativity, and methodology.
 - Methodological rules: each kind entails different presuppositions about authorial intent, canonical finality, typology, and theological synthesis.
 - Relation to systematics: argues for complementarity - biblical theology provides data, patterns, and trajectory that systematic theology should integrate, but systematics has its own justificatory tasks.
 - Applied clarifications: uses concrete controversies (e.g., debates on the Mosaic covenant as a covenant of works in substance; Klinean intrusion ethics) to show how confusions of kind produce mistaken conclusions.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages or situates against: Geerhardus Vos (historical redemptive development), Meredith Kline (Klinean covenant theology and "intrusion" language), Brevard Childs (canonical approach), Graeme Goldsworthy (Christocentric reading).
 - Draws on exegetical and methodological literature across Reformed and evangelical traditions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority and canonical shape), covenant theology (Mosaic covenant, covenant of works/merit), law and ethics (intrusion ethics debate), Christology (typology and fulfillment), soteriology (covenantal progression), hermeneutics (typology, canonical reading).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Poythress centers on a pluralized, disciplined conception of biblical theology that preserves redemptive-historical insight while protecting exegetical integrity and allowing responsible systematic appropriation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Emphasizes a taxonomy of biblical-theological projects rather than a monolithic method; insists on methodological self-awareness for each kind.
 - Stresses the normative-canonical versus descriptive-historical distinction as decisive for theological claims.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects tendencies in some Klinean and Vosian readings to over-apply redemptive-historical categories (e.g., treating every covenant passage as uniformly a covenant-of-works instance) by demanding clearer typological and canonical criteria.
 - Counters Childs-style exclusive canonicalism by defending the continuing role of historical-descriptive work for theological formation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deploys clear labels for "kinds" (descriptive, synthetic, canonical, systematic uses) and maps their relations; frames debates in terms of category mistakes rather than mere exegetical error.
 - Introduces discipline-sensitive rules for moving from biblical-theological description to normative theological claims.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarifying long-running debates about covenant typology and the law; consulted by scholars working on the Mosaic covenant, Klinean criticism, and the integration of biblical theology into systematics.
 - Used by conservative exegetes as a methodological corrective against overextension of particular readings; less embraced by those who prefer a single, unified biblical-theology movement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological map: helpful for teachers to set curriculum boundaries, for students to avoid category confusion, and for exegetes to justify disciplined syntheses between biblical data and doctrinal systems.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kinds of biblical theology**
 - Poythress' central taxonomy: multiple legitimate projects each with unique aims and methods.
- **Descriptive / historical biblical theology**
 - Traces development and sequence of revelation without prescribing final systematics.
- **Synthetic / thematic biblical theology**
 - Seeks patterns and themes (e.g., kingdom, covenant) across Scripture to produce integrated account.
- **Canonical biblical theology**
 - Focuses on the final form of the canon and theological reading within that canonical shape.
- **Systematic theology (relation)**
 - Distinct discipline that must integrate biblical-theological results while doing additional justificatory work.
- **Typology / Christocentric reading**
 - Method for seeing foreshadowing and fulfillment; Poythress insists on careful criteria to avoid anachronism.
- **Mosaic Covenant / Covenant of Works (as to substance)**
 - Poythress uses his taxonomy to test claims that the Mosaic covenant is a covenant of works in substance; he emphasizes distinguishing descriptive status from normative claims.
- **Klinean covenant theology**
 - Engages Meredith Kline's proposals (e.g., intrusion, covenant structure) and evaluates methodological coherence through the kinds framework.
- **Intrusion ethics**
 - The Klinean notion that sin "intrudes" into God's created order and ethical norms; Poythress assesses its exegetical scope and warns against collapsing ethical categories without typological justification.
- **Authority / normativity**
 - Distinguishes when biblical-theological descriptions carry normative force and when additional theological argumentation is required.
- **Vosian redemptive-historical method**
 - Recognizes Vos' contribution but refines application by insisting on internal distinctions between projects.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for methodological taxonomy in seminar courses on biblical theology.
- As a **polemic** or corrective against overzealous Klinean claims (e.g., Mosaic covenant as covenant of works in substance; intrusion ethics absolutized).
- As an **exegetical-model** for responsibly moving from redemptive-historical data to systematic theology while avoiding category mistakes.
