### TITLE
The Centrality of the Resurrection: A Study in Paul's Soteriology - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; developed within Westminster Theological Seminary milieu where classical Protestant orthodoxy and close Pauline exegesis were emphasized.
 - Reaction against reductionist accounts of atonement that marginalize the resurrection (both liberal demythologizing and narrowly forensic treatments).

- **Central thesis**
 - The resurrection of Christ is the indispensable center of Pauline soteriology: it is not an appendage or mere attestation of earlier events but the decisive eschatological inauguration that grounds justification, new creation, adoption, and the Spirit-bestowal realized in believers by union with Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical demonstration that Paul consistently frames God's saving act in terms of **Christ crucified and Christ raised** (e.g., Romans, 1 Corinthians, Philippians).
 - The resurrection functions as:
 - Divine vindication and enthronement (eschatological confirmation of Messiahship).
 - The inaugural event of the eschatological new creation (present and future dimensions).
 - The basis for believer's union with Christ and therefore for forensic and transformative aspects of salvation.
 - Systematic implications: the resurrection integrates justification, sanctification, adoption, Spirit, and hope; soteriology must be rearticulated around this center.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Paul's letters (close exegesis of Romans, 1 Corinthians, Philippians).
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern Pauline interpreters and historians of doctrine (broadly engaging both liberal-critical and some pietistic/formalist Reformed strains).
 - Implicit contrasts with figures who marginalize resurrection (e.g., existential/spiritualizing readings) and with those who treat atonement as exclusively forensic.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (OT/NT witnesses to God's saving acts), Christology (person and work), Trinity (implied in resurrection as act of Father raising the Son and Spirit-operating), soteriology (justification, sanctification, adoption, Spirit), eschatology (inaugurated/consummated tension), new creation.

- **Closing line**
 - For Gaffin, Paul's gospel is resurrection-centered: the crucified and risen Christ is the ontological and declarative hinge that makes forgiveness, new life, and final vindication theologically intelligible and pastorally effective.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Resurrection as the *constitutive* hinge of salvation rather than merely evidential or optional; it both demonstrates and effects God's saving work.
 - Strong integration of forensic and participatory dimensions via the motif of union with the risen Christ.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters theological moves that separate justification from new creation or that minimize bodily resurrection.
 - Pushes back on views that make atonement primarily juridical while making the resurrection an afterthought.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Repeated use of **resurrection as inaugurated eschatology**-the risen Christ as the firstfruits and present reality of the end.
 - Emphasis on **vindication-enthronement** language: resurrection as divine vindication leading to exaltation and lordship.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a corrective to both liberal demythologizing and reductionist forensic-only models.
 - Influential in discussions of Pauline theology, Christology, and the interrelation of justification and new creation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable exegetical model for integrating Pauline texts; valuable for preaching and systematic theology that seeks to keep resurrection central; pedagogically useful for bridging biblical studies and dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (Christ's)** - The decisive eschatological act by which God vindicates, enthrones, and inaugurates new creation; the soteriological center.
- **Union with Christ** - The relational category that explains how believers share in both crucifixion (forgiveness) and resurrection (new life/justification).
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The framework that locates resurrection as the firstfruits of the final consummation, both present reality and future hope.
- **Vindication/Enthronement** - Resurrection as divine verdict confirming Messiahship and bringing about exaltation and lordship.
- **Justification (Pauline)** - Forensic acquittal grounded in and inseparable from the risen status of Christ; justified persons share in the risen life.
- **New creation** - Soteriological outcome effected by the resurrection; ethical and ontological transformation now and consummated later.
- **Spirit-bestowal** - The Spirit's sending and indwelling are tied to the resurrection as the means by which the new life is applied to believers.
- **Bodily resurrection** - Affirmed as essential, not a spiritualized metaphor; ties soteriology to embodied renewal.
- **Christology (pre-existence and identity)** - Christ's person (pre-existent Son) is the one who dies and is raised; resurrection vindicates the incarnate Son.
- **Trinitarian action** - The resurrection is described in Trinitarian economy: Father's raising of the Son and the Spirit's application to believers.
- **Messianic consciousness** - Paul's view of Jesus as the crucified and risen Messiah whose kingly rule is revealed in the resurrection.
- **Eschatological hope** - The forward-looking effect of the resurrection in Christian life and ethics.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for articulating a resurrection-centered soteriology in systematic theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** in Pauline studies for linking justification, Spirit, and new creation to the risen Christ.
 - As a **polemic resource** against approaches that marginalize bodily resurrection or isolate forensic atonement from participatory renewal.
