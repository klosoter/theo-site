### TITLE
The Dynamics of Faith - Paul Tillich (1957)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post‑World War II, mid‑20th century Protestant theology; Tillich writes from a neo‑orthodox, existentialist frame responding to secularization, liberal rationalism, and fundamentalist reactions.
 - Intersects existential philosophy (Kierkegaard, Heidegger), Protestant scholastic and neo‑orthodox critiques, and pastoral concerns about meaning and doubt.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned**; it is ontological and existential rather than merely intellectual assent. True faith demands the whole person and manifests as the courage to accept one's being in relation to the ultimate.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: faith as an ultimate concern that claims total surrender and shapes orientation of life.
 - Dynamics: faith involves knowledge, obedience, trust, and devotion in one movement; doubt and questioning are intrinsic, not external, to genuine faith.
 - Symbols and language: religious language is symbolic, pointing beyond itself; literalism impoverishes faith.
 - Christ and revelation: Jesus Christ is presented as the **concrete revelation** of the ultimate; faith's object is the reality revealed in Christ, which creates a "new being."
 - Practical implication: faith restructures existence (courage, acceptance), shapes ethical life, and reinterprets religious institutions (church, sacraments) as symbolic and participatory.
 - Method: correlation - existential human questions correlated with theological answers.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kierkegaard (existential subjectivity), Luther (faith and justification), Schleiermacher (feeling of dependence), Heidegger (being), and contemporary theological debates with both liberal and fundamentalist camps.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Christ as revelatory event), Christology (Christ as power of new being), soteriology (salvation as restoration of being), sin/guilt/estrangement (existential categories), sacramental theology (symbols/participation), pneumatology in implicit dynamics of faith and renewal.

- **Closing line**
 - Tillich centers faith as an existential, ontological commitment - the "ultimate concern" revealed and fulfilled in Christ, producing a new mode of being grounded in courage and acceptance rather than mere intellectual assent.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Faith as an ontological state (not propositional belief): emphasis on existential commitment and the "courage to be."
 - Doubt is internal to faith; faith gains authenticity by confronting existential anxieties.
 - Religious language as symbolic - theology interprets signs, not literal metaphysical propositions.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Polemic against evidentialist/fundamentalist models that reduce faith to assent to propositions.
 - Corrects liberal sentimentalism that reduces religion to mere ethical or aesthetic feeling by reintroducing existential depth and the claim character of faith.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Ultimate concern," "ground of being" (God as ground rather than traditional theistic notion), "new being" as soteriological category, and the methodological "correlation" of human questions and divine answers.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in mainline Protestant theology, pastoral theology, and religious education; provided language for addressing doubt in pastoral contexts.
 - Criticized by conservative and evangelical theologians for perceived non‑personal language about God, and by some orthodox critics over Christological formulations (apparently downplaying classical hypostatic union).

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for pastoral care, interpreting faith in pluralist/secular contexts, and for theological method (correlation). Provokes ongoing debate about the balance between existential description and doctrinal precision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ultimate concern** - faith's definitional category: that which demands total surrender and gives ultimate meaning.
- **Courage to be** - the existential courage to accept one's being despite anxiety and estrangement; effect and evidence of authentic faith.
- **Faith (state, not proposition)** - an ontological posture encompassing trust, knowledge, obedience, and devotion.
- **Doubt (intrinsic)** - not a defect to be excised; a necessary element that tests and authenticates faith.
- **Symbolic language** - religious statements function as symbols pointing to transcendent reality; literalism is inadequate.
 - Relation: symbols participate in what they signify; they are not mere signs.
- **Ground of Being** - Tillich's preferred name for God; stresses existential depth rather than a first cause in classical theism.
- **New Being** - the soteriological result of encounter with Christ; restoration of authentic existence.
- **Christ as revelation** - Jesus is the concrete event in which the ultimate discloses itself; faith grasps this revelation existentially.
- **Method of correlation** - theological method matching existential questions with doctrinal answers.
- **Sin / estrangement** - existential alienation from one's true being and the ultimate; source of guilt and anxiety.
- **Grace (existential)** - the acceptance and empowerment that constitute the healing of estrangement; experienced as new being.
- **Sacraments (symbolic/participatory)** - seen as symbolic actions that participate in the new being rather than merely mechanical means.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source**: articulates "faith" for pastoral theology and religious education (faith as ultimate concern).
 - As a **polemic**: used against evidentialism, literalism, and reductive liberalism in debates over religious epistemology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot/model**: employed in Christology and pneumatology discussions where existential renewal and revelation are prioritized over metaphysical formulations.
