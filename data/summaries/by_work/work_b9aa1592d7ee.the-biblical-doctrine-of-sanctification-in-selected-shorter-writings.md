### TITLE
The Biblical Doctrine of Sanctification - B. B. Warfield (Selected Shorter Writings)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology. Warfield writes as a conservative Reformed exegete and systematician reacting to both Wesleyan perfectionism and lax views of holiness among some Protestants. The essay sits in a collection of shorter works intended for seminary and church use.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture teaches a twofold truth about sanctification: it is **definitive (positional)** in the believer by union with Christ and the Spirit, and **progressive (experiential)** in the believer's life. Warfield aims to preserve both without collapsing one into the other.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical analysis of Pauline categories (e.g., sanctification in Christ, sanctification by the Spirit, mortification/resurrection language).
 - Doctrinal synthesis: delineates **objective/forensic** elements (what God has done) and **subjective/ethical** elements (the life of mortification and growth).
 - Polemic against doctrines that either deny forensic definiteness (making sanctification only moral progress) or promise instantaneous eradication of sin (Wesleyan entire sanctification).
 - Practical implications: perseverance, pastoral care, discipline, assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary), the Reformed tradition (especially Calvinic emphases on union with Christ), contemporary Wesleyan writers (as foil), and standard patristic and confessional references to clarify historic usage of "sanctify."
- **Doctrines treated:** Sanctification (definitive and progressive), justification, regeneration, union with Christ, the Holy Spirit, sin (indwelling), perseverance, and the relation between forensic declaration and ethical transformation.
- **Closing line:** Warfield centers sanctification on the believer's **real and settled standing in Christ (definitive)** as the ground for a lifelong **Spirit-wrought moral growth (progressive)**-holding both to safeguard assurance without encouraging complacency or perfectionist presumption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear insistence that sanctification has a **legal/positional** side (a present reality in Christ) and an **experimental/processual** side (growth and struggle).
 - Stress on union with Christ as the **ground** of definitive sanctification rather than merely an ethical admonition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Reformed tendencies that minimize present holiness by overemphasizing future glorification or justification alone.
 - Rejects Wesleyan/Methodist claims of instantaneous entire sanctification that eradicates the propensity to sin; instead affirms ongoing mortification.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful terminological delimiting of "definitive sanctification" vs "progressive sanctification" to prevent category confusion (positional vs practical sanctification).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian instruction as a clear corrective to both antinomian readings and perfectionist claims.
 - Influential in seminary pedagogy for integrating Pauline exegesis with pastoral theology on holiness.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact model that preserves biblical tensions (already/not yet) and offers practical pastoral counsel without theological compromise.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definitive sanctification (positional sanctification):** The believer's consecrated status in Christ effected by union with Him and the Spirit; a settled forensic/ontological fact.
- **Progressive sanctification (experiential sanctification):** The ongoing Spirit-driven moral and spiritual transformation of the believer throughout life.
- **Union with Christ:** The primary ground for definitive sanctification; serves as the nexus between justification and sanctification.
- **Regeneration:** The Spirit's inward renewal that issues in sacred life and is tied to both definitive standing and progressive growth.
- **Imputation vs impartation:** Warfield distinguishes the forensic crediting of Christ's holiness (ground of assurance) from the Spirit's imparted sanctifying energy without collapsing them.
- **Mortification / vivification:** Terms for the believer's practical warfare (putting sin to death) and enlivening by the Spirit toward holiness.
- **Entire sanctification / perfectionism:** Rejected as a doctrine promising eradication of indwelling sin in this life; Warfield argues holiness is progressive, not instantaneously perfected.
- **Forensic / ethical distinction:** Forensic (legal/positional) realities do not obviate ethical responsibilities and growth.
- **Indwelling sin / remaining corruption:** Acknowledged reality; sanctification does not mean absence of temptation or sinful propensity until glorification.
- **Perseverance:** Seen as outcome and evidence of the Spirit's progressive work grounded in definitive sanctification.
- **Assurance:** Properly grounded in definitive standing in Christ; not negated by the reality of ongoing struggle.
- **Scriptural exegesis (Pauline focus):** Uses Pauline texts to anchor both aspects-e.g., "sanctified in Christ" and "work out your salvation."
- **Pastoral application:** Balances comfort (you are holy in Christ) with exhortation (grow in holiness).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for seminarians distinguishing positional vs practical sanctification.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Wesleyan entire sanctification and antinomian readings.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline sanctification language in systematic theology and pastoral counseling.
