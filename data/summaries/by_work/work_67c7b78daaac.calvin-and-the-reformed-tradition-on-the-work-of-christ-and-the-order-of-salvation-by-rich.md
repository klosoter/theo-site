### TITLE
Calvin and the Reformed Tradition: On the Work of Christ and the Order of Salvation - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (study of John Calvin on union with Christ and ordo salutis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed renewal; Gaffin writes from conservative Presbyterian/Reformed scholarship reacting to both pietistic reductions of justification and scholastic compartmentalizations of ordo salutis. He returns to Calvin and the Reformed corpus to recover a biblically anchored account of Christ's work and its application.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Calvin's theology centers **union with Christ** as the indispensable nexus linking Christ's accomplished work (objective redemption) to the believer's salvation (subjective benefit). The order of salvation must be understood relationally in union, not merely as a temporal or mechanical series.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical recovery of Calvin on Pauline texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) that present union as the fundamental communion whereby Christ's obedience, suffering, and resurrection are appropriated.
 - Theological articulation that defends both the **objective reality** of Christ's atoning accomplishment and the **real, Spirit-wrought union** by which sinners receive that accomplishment.
 - Critique of models that isolate justification from sanctification or that make application purely forensic without ontological union.
 - Reaffirmation of classical Reformed loci: federal headship, imputation, active/passive obedience, and sacramental means as mediated through union.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary: John Calvin and Reformed confessional tradition; interlocutors include later Reformed scholastics and contemporary evangelical and Reformed theologians who either minimize union or separate objective/subjective aspects of salvation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (active/passive obedience; mediation), soteriology (imputation; justification; sanctification; adoption), covenant theology (federal headship; covenant of redemption), pneumatology (union as Spirit-wrought), ecclesiology and sacramental practice (communion with Christ).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** For Gaffin, Calvin's theology insists that Christ's once-for-all accomplishment is made ours not by abstract decree alone but by a real, Spirit-wrought **union with Christ** that grounds the whole order of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong recovery of **union with Christ** as the interpretive key for both Christology and ordo salutis.
 - Balanced insistence on the **objective efficacy** of Christ's work together with the **real, ontological basis** of application in union (avoids both nominalism and mere forensicism).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against tendencies in some scholastic and modern treatments to treat justification and sanctification as radically separable processes or to reduce application to legal imputation only.
 - Challenges pietistic or experiential reductions that make union merely psychological or metaphorical rather than ontological and sacramental.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reorients classical loci so that the ordo salutis is read through relational language (union) rather than strictly sequential steps; treats imputation, participation, and sanctification as distinct but inseparable aspects of the one union.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles for restoring Calvin's union theology as central to contemporary debates on justification, assurance, and Pauline interpretation.
 - Used as a corrective against both liberalized and overly scholastic accounts of atonement/application.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a coherent bridge between exegesis (Pauline texts) and systematic theology; useful in courses on soteriology, Calvin, and Reformed doctrine; supplies a robust framework for pastoral concerns about assurance and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Central relational reality by which believers partake in Christ's life, death, resurrection; the grounding of all benefits.
- **Objective redemption:** The accomplished, once-for-all work of Christ (satisfaction, propitiation) as true irrespective of individual appropriation.
- **Subjective application:** The reception of Christ's benefits - not merely forensic imputation but actual participation via union.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's perfect law-keeping credited to believers through union and imputation.
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death as penal substitution - the ground for forgiveness, communicated in union.
- **Federal headship:** Christ as covenantal representative whose acts are imputed to the elect in virtue of union.
- **Imputation:** The crediting of Christ's righteousness and sinners' guilt-transference; for Gaffin integrally related to union, not an abstract legal fiction.
- **Ordo salutis (order of salvation):** Understood relationally - election, calling, justification, sanctification, glorification framed by union rather than simple temporal sequence.
- **Pneumatological union:** The Spirit as the agent effecting and sustaining union; sacraments as means.
- **Participation:** Biblical notion of sharing in Christ's benefits - metaphysically grounded by union and often used alongside imputation.
- **Covenant of redemption:** The intra-Trinitarian covenant that locates Christ's mediatorial work and federal headship as precondition of union.
- **Sacramental mediation:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper as signs/seals that signify and confirm union in the believer's experience.
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration grounded in Christ's work and appropriated in union - not detached from participatory realities.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, union-centered account of how Christ's work becomes ours.
- As a **polemic** against accounts that divorce objective accomplishment from real participation or that reduce salvation to mere legal declaration.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts (esp. Romans/Galatians) through the category of union with Christ.
