### TITLE
**The Sacraments: A Dogmatic Treatise** (treatment in Thomas Aquinas; summarized in Ludwig Ott)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - 13th-century Scholasticism; Summa Theologiae (Prima Pars, Prima Secundae, Secunda Secundae; treatises on sacraments and grace), De sacramentis; synthesis of Augustinian sacramental insight with Aristotelian metaphysics.
 - Later reception and systematic summary in manuals (notably Ludwig Ott) and definitive formulation at Trent (echoing Thomistic categories).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sacraments are visible, instituted signs by which Christ effects the grace they signify; they are real instrumental causes of sanctifying and actual grace within the economy of salvation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition: a sacrament is a sign that effects what it signifies (signum et res).
 - Ontology: Sacraments are material signs composed of matter and form; their efficacy is grounded in Christ's institution and in divine causality acting through created instruments.
 - Causality: sacraments operate as instrumental causes (not magical); efficacy rests on God's action (ex opere operato) while human dispositions (ex opere operantis) affect fruitfulness.
 - Ecclesial mediation: the Church is the sacramental agent; ministers act in persona Christi with proper intention and matter/form.
 - Application: treatment of necessity, number (seven in later reception), ministerial requirements, effects (justification, sanctifying grace, sacramental character), and individual sacraments (notably Baptism and Eucharist).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture, Augustine, Dionysius, Peter Lombard, Gratian, Aristotelian philosophy, Church Fathers; later engagement with medieval canonists and the Council of Trent.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Incarnation and Christology (Christ as primordial sacrament), Trinity (sacraments as Trinitarian economy), grace (sanctifying vs actual), ecclesiology, justification, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas centers sacramental theology on the incarnate Christ who, through visible signs and the Church's ministry, truly confers the divine life by instrumental causality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous integration of Aristotelian causality: sacraments as instrumental causes whereby God produces grace through created signs.
 - Priority of Christ's institution: sacraments derive efficacy from Christ's promise and action, not from intrinsic power of matter or minister.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More metaphysically precise than early patristic imagery; clarifies Augustine's tensions about sign and thing.
 - In contrast to later Protestant formulations, Aquinas rejects pure memorialism and any reduction of sacramental efficacy to subjective faith alone.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of **matter and form** for sacramental elements and words; distinction between **sacramentum tantum** (the sign) and **res et sacramentum** (sign and thing signified).
 - Development of the functional idea later summarized as **ex opere operato** balanced with **ex opere operantis** (role of recipient's disposition).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for post-Tridentine Catholic dogmatics; standard exemplar in manuals (e.g., Ludwig Ott).
 - Main target in Reformation debates: Luther affirmed objective presence but differed on Eucharistic metaphysics; Calvin affirmed instrumental efficacy but rejected sacerdotal mediation as conceived in medieval scholasticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a durable, philosophically disciplined sacramental theology useful for dogmatics, pastoral praxis, and ecumenical engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacramentum (sacrament)** - a visible sign instituted by Christ that causes the grace it signifies.
- **Signum et res** - formulation: sacraments are both sign and thing signified (they signify and confer what they signify).
- **Matter and form** - technical pair: material element (water, bread, oil) + spoken/formulaic words constitute a valid rite.
- **Instrumental causality** - sacraments operate as instruments by which God, the principal cause, effects grace.
- **Ex opere operato** - the objective efficacy of the sacrament insofar as the sacrament is performed according to intention and rite.
 - contrasted with **ex opere operantis** - the role of recipient's dispositions (faith, repentance) in receiving fruits.
- **In persona Christi** - minister acts as Christ's instrument; ministerial intention and correct matter/form required for validity.
- **Sanctifying grace / actual grace** - sacraments principally confer sanctifying grace (habitual life) and grant actual grace for acts.
- **Sacramental character** - indelible mark imprinted by Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Orders (ontological change).
- **Validity vs liceity** - distinction between whether a sacrament truly takes effect (valid) and whether it was lawfully performed (licit).
- **Transubstantiation** - Thomistic metaphysical account accepted in Catholic Eucharistic theology: substance change, accidents remain (applied chiefly to Eucharist).
- **Necessity of sacraments** - necessary as ordinary means of grace given by Christ for salvation (with provision for extraordinary divine action).
- **Church as sacramental agent** - the ecclesial structure and ministry mediate sacramental economy.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary doctrinal source in Catholic sacramental theology and dogmatic instruction (definition, causality, requisites).
- As polemic and comparative resource in debates with Protestant accounts of means of grace and Eucharistic presence.
- As an exegetical-model and conceptual pivot for interpreting biblical sacramental passages and for pastoral administration of the rites.
