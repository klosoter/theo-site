### TITLE
Perspectives on Church Government: Five Views - John M. Frame (Reformed/Presbyterian contribution)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed conversation about ecclesiology and polity; part of an edited volume presenting competing models (typically Presbyterian, Congregational, Episcopal, etc.). Addresses renewed interest in historic Reformation polity among conservative Protestants and seminary debates about offices and discipline.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Presbyterian government most faithfully embodies the New Testament pattern and the covenantal nature of the church by combining biblical office-honoring with representative, collegial rule; it preserves both pastoral authority and corporate accountability necessary for faithful teaching and discipline.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical grounding: careful treatment of apostolic and pastoral-epistolary texts (e.g., Acts, 1 & 2 Timothy, Titus, 1 Peter) to show the biblical reality and functions of elders/pastors/overseers.
 - Theological rationale: locates polity within Reformed covenant theology - church as covenant community requires representative, ordered leadership.
 - Practical outworking: defines offices (teaching elders, ruling elders, deacons), councils (session, presbytery, synod, assembly), and procedures for ordination, call, and discipline.
 - Polemical comparisons: contrasts Presbyterianism with congregational autonomy and episcopal hierarchy, arguing for balance between local accountability and wider church unity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformed confessions and classical Presbyterian authors (implicitly or explicitly), New Testament scholarship on church offices, contemporary advocates of congregational and episcopal models (as foil for contrast).
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology (nature of the church, marks, sacraments), office and ordination, church discipline, covenant, authority and jurisdiction, and the relationship of church law to Scripture.
- **Closing line capturing the theological center of gravity:** Presbyterian polity, grounded in Scripture and covenant theology, orders the church so that pastoral teaching, communal accountability, and corporate discipline work together to preserve gospel truth and holiness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong integration of covenantal logic with polity: elders act as representative covenant officers, not merely functionaries.
 - Stress on the *parity* and plurality of elders - a collegial leadership that resists both congregational isolation and episcopal monocracy.
 - Emphasis on discipline as intrinsic to the church's witnessing and sanctifying office, not merely punitive or optional.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects congregational over-emphasis on local autonomy by showing biblical warrant for inter-church courts and mutual oversight.
 - Challenges episcopal models that elevate singular hierarchical authority by tracing New Testament patterns toward shared eldership.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Application of systematic theological categories (e.g., covenant representation, authority as delegated and limited) to practical polity questions.
 - Use of modern pastoral-theological concerns (accountability, sound doctrine preservation) framed within historic Reformed vocabulary.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted widely in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian training contexts as a clear, pastorally sensitive defense of classical Presbyterian polity.
 - Served as a bridge text for evangelicals exploring confessional Presbyterianism; repeatedly cited in seminary syllabi and pastoral training on eldership and discipline.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise, theologically integrated case for Presbyterian government useful as both an introductory summary and a practical guide for elders and church courts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elder / Presbyter:** The core office; a plurality of elders govern each congregation. Often subdivided into:
 - **Teaching elder (pastor):** Primary preacher/teacher and sacramental minister.
 - **Ruling elder:** Lay officer sharing in governance, pastoral oversight, and discipline.
- **Bishop / Overseer:** Discussed as terminological equivalent in NT to elder; Frame emphasizes functional overlap rather than later hierarchical development.
- **Session:** Local court composed of elders that governs the congregation, disciplines, and oversees worship and membership.
- **Presbytery / Synod / General Assembly:** Successive courts for inter-congregational oversight, doctrine adjudication, and coordination.
- **Ordination / Call:** Covenantal acts by which officers are set apart and recognized by the church community and courts.
- **Discipline:** Mechanism for addressing sin, preserving purity, and restoring members; treated as essential, not optional.
- **Representative government:** The idea that officers act on behalf of Christ and the covenant people, not as autonomous rulers.
- **Parity of elders:** Doctrinal point that elders share authority collectively; resists both clericalism and congregational absolutism.
- **Covenant theology (polity-applied):** Frames the church as covenant community requiring ordered, representative leadership.
- **Authority (delegated & circumscribed):** Church authority derives from Christ, exercised within Scripture-defined limits and corporate structures.
- **Church discipline & pastoral care linkage:** Discipline is framed as part of pastoral responsibility toward holiness and doctrinal fidelity.
- **Regulative concerns:** Attention to whether polity practices conform to Scripture and confessional standards.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classical Presbyterian structures and the theological rationale for elders, courts, and discipline.
- As a **polemic resource** in debates with congregational and episcopal advocates, offering systematic and biblical counter-arguments.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT texts on elders/bishops in a Reformed key and for deriving polity from covenantal and ecclesial principles.
