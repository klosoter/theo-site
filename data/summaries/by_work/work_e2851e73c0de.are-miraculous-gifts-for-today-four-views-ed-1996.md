### TITLE
Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? Four Views (ed. Wayne Grudem, 1996)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-1990s evangelical milieu; published by a broadly Reformed evangelical editor (Wayne Grudem) during heightened debate between Pentecostal/charismatic movements and conservative Reformed/Puritan-influenced cessationists. Aimed at readers within evangelical seminaries, churches, and parachurch ministries during renewed interest in continuation of sign gifts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The book frames the contested question whether the New Testament "miraculous" gifts (tongues, prophecy, healings, revelatory words) continue in the church today or ceased with the apostolic age/canon. It intentionally presents four representative positions rather than one synthetic conclusion.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Four distinct essays present and defend four canonical positions on miraculous gifts; each is followed by critical interaction from other contributors and a final rejoinder by the original author.
 - Major moves per view: exegetical argument from Scripture (esp. 1 Corinthians, Ephesians, Acts), historical-theological evidence (post-apostolic church, Reformation), doctrinal implications for revelation and sanctification, and pastoral/practical tests for authenticity.
 - Emphasis on how gift-claims affect authority (Scripture vs. perceived new revelation) and sanctification (orderly church life, spiritual maturity).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** New Testament texts (1 Corinthians, Acts, Ephesians), patristic and post-patristic historical witness, Reformation and Puritan reactions, contemporary Pentecostal and charismatic leaders; the volume stages direct dialog across traditions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (nature and operation of the Holy Spirit), revelation and canon (finality vs. ongoing revelatory utterances), ecclesiology (authority and order), soteriology/sanctification (relation of gifts to growth and holiness), and pastoral theology (discernment and testing of spirits).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The book functions as a disciplined arena where competing pneumatologies-apostolic-era exceptionalism vs. normative continuation-are pressed against Scripture, history, and pastoral exigency to calibrate the church's understanding of miraculous gifts and their role in sanctification and church life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Methodological balance: each view afforded extended space plus peer critique; fosters intra-evangelical conversation rather than mere polemic.
 - Practical tests for authenticity are highlighted (fruit, conformity to Scripture, pastoral accountability).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges simplistic cessationist claims that all sign gifts ceased immediately after the apostles by marshaling nuanced historical and exegetical arguments.
 - Equally critiques charismatic excesses that elevate contemporary utterances over canon or neglect ecclesial order.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear operational distinctions between "sign gifts" (specific revelatory/confirmatory functions) and "edifying gifts" (instructional/ministrative), used as analytic tools across essays.
 - Frequent appeal to a mediating category: "regulated continuationism" - continuity of gifts constrained by canonical and pastoral norms.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used in seminary classrooms as a representative dialogical resource; helped legitimize scholarly engagement with charismatic claims among Reformed evangelicals.
 - Influenced later works that seek middle-ground positions (e.g., regulative approaches to continuation).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Durable pedagogical model: four-view format with cross-response fosters critical thinking.
 - Serves as primary reference when mapping contemporary evangelical divisions on pneumatology and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Continuationism:** The position that miraculous gifts continue today; argued for by one or more contributors with caveats about misuse.
- **Cessationism:** The view that certain revelatory/sign gifts ceased with apostles or canon; defended in at least one essay.
- **Sign gifts:** Gifts that attest to divine authority (healing, tongues as sign to unbelievers, confirmatory prophecy).
- **Edifying gifts:** Non-sign gifts aimed at building the church (teaching, administration); contrasted with sign gifts.
- **Regulated continuationism:** A mid-position that accepts ongoing gifts but insists on Scripture-shaped controls and discernment.
- **Canonical finality:** Argument that the completion of Scripture terminates new authoritative revelation; central to cessationist arguments.
- **Discernment tests:** Criteria set out for evaluating purported gifts (Scriptural conformity, moral fruit, ecclesial accountability).
- **Pneumatological locus:** How the Spirit is defined as acting either unusually (apostolic) or ordinarily (ongoing) - core hermeneutical difference.
- **Sanctification and gifts:** Discussion on whether gifts function as sanctifying means or can be divorced from maturity and holiness.
- **Authority vs. Experience:** Tension between canonical authority and contemporary charismatic experience; a recurrent analytic axis.
- **Historical witness:** Patristic and medieval references used to argue for or against continuation beyond apostolic era.
- **Pastoral implications:** Practical consequences for church order, leadership selection, and discipline arising from gift-claims.
- **Prophecy (contemporary):** Treated as a test case - its limits, authority, and relation to Scripture debated.
- **Tongues:** Debated as either ecstatic/non-intelligible utterance or known languages; diagnostic for classification.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** when mapping evangelical positions on spiritual gifts and sanctification.
 - As a **polemic and pedagogical model** in discussions of Pentecostalism and the Reformed response, providing both critique and corrective exemplars.
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting 1 Corinthians and Acts in light of ecclesial practice and doctrinal norms.
