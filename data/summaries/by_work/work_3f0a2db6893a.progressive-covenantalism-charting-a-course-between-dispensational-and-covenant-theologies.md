### TITLE
Progressive Covenantalism: Charting a Course Between Dispensational and Covenant Theologies - edited by Stephen J. Wellum and Brent E. Parker (collection of essays). 
**Genre:** Evangelical Reformed constructive and polemical theology; redemptive-historical biblical theology engaging both systematic questions and pastoral loci.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early twenty-first-century Reformed-evangelical milieu seeking a middle way between classical Dispensationalism and traditional Covenant Theology.
 - Product of debates over Israel/Church relations, eschatology, and hermeneutical method in conservative seminaries and churches.
 - Presents a coordinated multi-author program for a coherent alternative: "progressive covenantalism" (PC).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - PC argues that God's one redemptive purpose unfolds *progressively* through distinct covenantal administrations rather than being best explained by either a sharp dispensational division of peoples or a static federal covenant system that collapses meaningful historical discontinuity.
 - The core problem: how to hold **unity of God's people and promises** while accounting for **biblical discontinuities** and the NT fulfillment language.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Method - defense of a redemptive-historical / biblical-theological approach that interacts with systematic theology (see "Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology" usage).
 - Part II: Exegesis - close readings of key covenants (Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, New Covenant) and how promises develop typologically (engages "Biblical Covenants").
 - Part III: Systematics - theology of Christ, church, sacraments, and eschatology integrating progressive unfolding; contrasts with Dispensationalism and classical Covenant Theology ("Dispensationalism And Progressive Covenantalism").
 - Part IV: Ethics and application - implications for ecclesiology, preaching, and moral theology; conversation with Klinean motifs, including critique of some uses of "intrusion" thinking ("Klinean Covenant Theology And Intrusion Ethics").

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Editors/contributors: Wellum, Parker and others constructing a correlated proposal.
 - Main interlocutors: classical Dispensationalists (sharp Israel/Church split), historic Covenant Theologians (federal schema), and Kline's royal-grant emphases.
 - Draws on redemptive-historical interpreters and recent biblical-theological scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/biblical theology, covenant theology (covenant of redemption, administrations), Christology (fulfillment), ecclesiology (people of God), sacraments, eschatology (already/not-yet), biblical ethics.

- **Closing line**
 - PC's theological center of gravity: **one covenantal plan realized progressively in Christ**, preserving promise-fulfillment and typological continuity while recognizing canonical discontinuities and pastoral implications.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Distinguishes between the *one* covenantal purpose of God and its *progressive administrations*, stressing canonical unfolding vs static system-building.
 - Emphasizes canonical, redemptive-historical exegesis as normative for systematic conclusions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - To Dispensationalism: rejects rigid two-peoples model and separate prophetic destinies; affirms fulfillment of Israel's promises in Christ and his people.
 - To classic Covenant Theology: resists collapsing historical distinctiveness into a single repetitive covenantal formula; pushes for clearer handling of discontinuity.
 - To Klinean readings: appropriates the royal-grant insight of future intrusion but critiques overly speculative "intrusion ethics" that skew present moral order or ecclesial practice.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Terminology: "progressive administrations" of the one covenant; integration of typology as real, not merely rhetorical; nuanced use of promise/fulfillment categories.
 - Methodological pivot: explicit bridging of biblical theology with systematic theology rather than subordination of one to the other.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among younger Reformed evangelicals as an interpretive and apologetic alternative; sparked continued debate with dispensationalists and traditional covenant theologians.
 - Adopted pedagogically in seminaries as a model for redemptive-historical preaching and theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for those seeking a middle trajectory: helpful as an exegetical handbook, systematic corrective, and curriculum for seminary courses on covenants and biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Progressive Covenantalism (PC):** The programmatic label - one covenantal purpose progressively administered through history.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** Eternal intra-Trinitarian pact anchoring the progressive storyline.
- **Covenant administrations / administrations of the covenant:** Distinct historical expressions (e.g., Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) that carry continuity and discontinuity.
- **Promise-Fulfillment / Typology:** Typological events and persons as genuine anticipations fulfilled in Christ; central hermeneutical tool.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity:** Balanced taxonomy for theological and ecclesial consequences (neither full identity nor absolute rupture).
- **Israel/Church relation:** Single redemptive people in two administratively distinct expressions - promises fulfilled in Christ's people.
- **Already / Not-Yet (Eschatology):** Christocentric eschatological tension governing sacramental and ethical life.
- **Biblical Theology vs Systematic Theology:** PC insists on biblical-theological exegesis informing, not being subservient to, systematics.
- **Klinean themes / Intrusion ethics:** Acknowledges Kline's insight about the eschaton's intrusion but critiques overextension into present ethical claims.
- **Typological Realism:** Affirmation that OT institutions have ontological, not merely predictive, connection to NT realities.
- **Sacramental continuity/discontinuity:** Retains baptized/communion practice as covenantal sign yet reinterprets their relation to Israelite rites.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Progressive Covenantalism and its methodological commitments.
 - As a **polemic** resource against classical Dispensationalism and certain applications of older Covenant Theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for redemptive-historical preaching and OT/NT covenant studies.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic treatments of ecclesiology, eschatology, and sacramental theology within conservative Reformed contexts.
