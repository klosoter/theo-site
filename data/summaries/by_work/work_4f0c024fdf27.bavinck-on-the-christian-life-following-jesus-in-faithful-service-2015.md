### TITLE
Bavinck on the Christian Life: Following Jesus in Faithful Service (John Bolt, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2015 amid a renewed interest in Herman Bavinck (1854-1921) within contemporary Reformed theology; part of a twentieth-twenty‑first century retrieval of Dutch Neo‑Calvinist resources for doctrine and ethics.
 - Bolt writes as theological historian and interpreter, aiming to make Bavinck's pastoral-ethical vision accessible for modern readers and practitioners.

- **Central thesis**
 - Bavinck's Christian life is best understood as a sustained **following of Jesus**: a faith‑rooted, grace‑empowered life of faithful service in covenantal vocation, intelligibly grounded in doctrine and concretely shaped for cultural engagement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey + synthesis of Bavinck's writings on piety, sanctification, vocation, and church life.
 - Key moves:
 - Establish Bavinck's theological anthropology and union with Christ as the foundation for ethics.
 - Trace how faith and obedience cohere: sanctification as both gift and task.
 - Show how **common grace** and **preparatory grace** mediate Christian engagement with culture and non‑Christian neighbors.
 - Articulate implications for vocation, church discipline, and pastoral formation.
 - Bolt foregrounds continuity between Bavinck's dogmatics and his pastoral theology - doctrine shapes life, life witnesses to doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Herman Bavinck (dogmatics, sermons, lectures).
 - Interlocutors: Kuyperian Neo‑Calvinism, classic Reformed voices (Calvin, Francis Turretin), pietistic and liberal critiques.
 - Contemporary conversation partners: modern Reformed ethicists and pastoral theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Word (normative shape of Christian life)
 - Covenant theology (locus for identity and vocation)
 - Christology/union with Christ (ontological basis of sanctification)
 - Sanctification, holiness, and mortification
 - Common grace and preparatory grace (culture, mission, unbelievers)
 - Vocation, law/gospel, church and sacraments, conscience

- **Closing line**
 - Bolt presents Bavinck's theological center as a robustly **Christocentric, covenantal, grace‑saturated ethics**: Christian life is discipleship shaped by doctrine and lived out in faithful service to God and neighbor.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of systematic theology and lived piety: doctrine is not merely propositional but formative.
 - Balanced account of sanctification that affirms both divine gift and human responsibility without reducing either.
 - Clear treatment of cultural engagement via **common** and **preparatory grace** - Bavinck affirms goodness in non‑Christian culture while insisting on redemptive priority of the gospel.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that cast Bavinck as overly intellectual or solely dogmatic; Bolt shows Bavinck as pastorally attentive.
 - Distinguishes Bavinck from Kuyperian absolutism and from pietistic withdrawal: he is both culturally engaged and confessionally anchored.

- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - Recuperation of Bavinck's nuanced use of **preparatory grace** (God's preparatory work in non‑Christian persons and cultures for the reception of the gospel).
 - Emphasis on **faith as trustful obedience**-not mere assent, not works‑righteousness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in contemporary Reformed ethics, pastoral formation, and mission studies; often cited in curricula that bridge dogmatics and moral theology.
 - Strengthened the modern reception of Bavinck as a resource for public theology and faithful cultural engagement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable model for integrating doctrine and life: valuable for seminarians, pastors, and ethicists seeking a confessional yet culturally engaged Christian ethic.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common Grace**
 - God's general restraining and sustaining goodness toward creation (enabling culture, knowledge, art, civic life) distinct from saving grace.
 - Function: grounds legitimate non‑Christian goods without neutralizing the need for gospel.

- **Preparatory Grace**
 - A dimension of common grace where God providentially prepares hearts and cultures to receive the gospel.
 - Distinction: not salvific, but providentially ordaining occasions for mission and conversion.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Ontological basis for all Christian life; source of justification and sanctification.

- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive work of the Spirit that is both positional (in Christ) and experiential (ethical growth).

- **Vocation**
 - God‑given calling in particular social roles; locus of faithful service and holiness in daily life.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - Structural frame for identity, promise, and ecclesial formation shaping moral obligations.

- **Faith and Obedience**
 - Faith conceived as trust expressed in obedience; ethical life as the fruit of trust in Christ.

- **Law/Gospel Relation**
 - Law regulates and reveals sin; gospel empowers and frees for obedient love; both are necessary for Christian life.

- **Imago Dei (practical)**
 - Basis for human dignity, cultural mandate, and responsibilities in vocation.

- **Church as Community**
 - The primary social form for discipleship, sacramental nourishment, and moral accountability.

- **Holiness & Mortification**
 - Positive pursuit of virtue and negative turning from sin as ongoing spiritual disciplines.

- **Public Theology / Cultural Engagement**
 - Bavinck's framework legitimizes serious cultural participation without theological compromise.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** for Bavinckian framing of Christian life as doctrinally informed discipleship.
- **Polemic resource** against reductionist pietism and antinomian tendencies, and against simplistic secular engagement.
- **Exegetical/modeling tool** for integrating dogmatics, pastoral theology, and ethics - especially in teaching sanctification, vocation, and mission.
