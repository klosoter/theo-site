### TITLE
The Teaching of Jesus Concerning Himself - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 20th-century Reformed scholarship; Vos writes as part of emerging redemptive-historical biblical theology in reaction to liberal critical and psychological explanations of Jesus. He addresses continental critical voices (e.g., Ritschlian reductionism, Schweitzerian eschatologism) and the confessional tradition (Chalcedonian Christology).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jesus' self-consciousness and self-testimony must be explained by the personal, hypostatic union of divine and human natures; his messianic and filial claims are neither later legend nor mere religious experience but stem from the single person of the incarnate Son.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of Jesus' self-designations and self-acts in the Synoptics and John (titles, sayings, messianic claims).
 - Critique of modern explanations that reduce Jesus' self-understanding to psychological states, prophetic vocation, or post-resurrection appraisal.
 - Positive dogmatic reconstruction: the unity of Jesus' self-consciousness is rooted in the hypostatic union; diversity of expressions reflects the interplay of two natures in one person and the progressive disclosure of his office.
 - Practical exegetical conclusions: how particular sayings are to be read in light of incarnational ontology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engagement with modern critical scholars (implicitly and explicitly contrasted with Ritschl, Wrede, Schweitzer-type approaches), constructive dialogue with patristic and conciliar formulations (notably Chalcedon) and the Reformed tradition (usage of doctrinal categories rather than systematic polemics).
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology** (primary), especially **Hypostatic Union**, pre-existence, filial relation to the Father, messianic office, divine and human knowledge, and methodologically the relation of biblical exegesis to dogmatic formulation.
- **Closing line:** Vos centers Christology on the person: Jesus' self-testimony is best understood not as isolated sayings or psychological reports but as the self-conscious expression of the one divine person who, by virtue of the hypostatic union, manifests both true humanity and true deity in his historical self-revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Prioritizes the person (hypostasis) over isolated acts or teachings; the unity of subject explains the variety of self-expressions.
 - Uses a redemptive-historical lens: Jesus' self-consciousness unfolds in mission and revelation, not as developmental immaturity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals:** 
 - Rejects reductionist explanations that locate Jesus' messianic claims in mere religious experience, social role, or later Christian reinterpretation.
 - Opposes kenotic or functional Christologies that unduly separate the divine subject from its self-awareness or diminish the continuity of divine consciousness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Emphasizes the explanatory primacy of **hypostatic union** for exegetical problems about Jesus' knowledge and self-claims.
 - Clarifies language about "degrees" or "modes" of consciousness without implying two persons-stresses unity of subject amid two natures.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Highly influential within Reformed and conservative evangelical scholarship as a corrective to liberal historiography.
 - Serves as a model for integrating exegetical detail with dogmatic categories; later Reformed scholars and biblical theologians frequently cite Vos for methodological balance.
- **Enduring value:** Compact, disciplined defense of orthodox Christology that models how biblical data and classical doctrine (Chalcedon) jointly resolve modern critical challenges.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** Central explanatory category - the personal union of divine and human natures in the one Son explains Jesus' unified self-consciousness.
- **Self-consciousness of Jesus:** Not a psychological datum to be isolated; rather the incarnate Son's awareness as manifested in mission, prayer, and proclamation.
- **Son of God / Son of Man:** Distinct titles reflecting filial relation and messianic office; Vos reads them as complementary expressions of one person.
- **Pre-existence:** The Son's eternal subsistence undergirds his identity and authority in history; his earthly self-revelation is grounded in prior personal existence.
- **Messianic Consciousness:** Progressive, historically realized awareness tied to mission; not merely prophetic role nor post-facto reinterpretation.
- **Divine knowledge vs. human knowledge:** Vos insists on a tension resolved in the person - real human ignorance or limitation is compatible with divine omniscience in the incarnate Son by virtue of union.
- **Kenosis (critique):** Vos rejects extreme kenotic readings that posit a forfeiture of divine attributes; instead he holds to a relational expression of attributes within one person.
- **Personal subsistence (hypostasis):** The decisive locus for attributing actions and sayings-what the person is, not separate natures acting apart.
- **Messianic Secret (method):** Vos treats the varying explicitness of Jesus' claims as strategic and theological, not proof of later invention.
- **Redemptive-historical method:** Reading Jesus' words within the economy of salvation history, emphasizing continuity of divine purpose.
- **Chalcedonian synthesis:** Serves as normative theological frame: two natures, one person.
- **Prophetic vocation:** Recognized but subordinated to personal sonship; prophecy is not a substitute explanation for divine self-consciousness.
- **Exegetical-dogmatic integration:** Vos models how careful textual reading and dogmatic categories reciprocally inform one another.

How this work is used:
- **Definition source:** Clarifies and defends orthodox usage of hypostatic union in explaining Christ's self-awareness.
- **Polemic:** Employed against liberal, psychological, or kenotic distortions of Jesus' identity.
- **Exegetical model:** Provides a template for reading Gospel self-statements within incarnational and redemptive-historical frameworks.
