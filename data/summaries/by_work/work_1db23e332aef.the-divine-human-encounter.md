### TITLE
**Emil Brunner, The Divine-Human Encounter** 
Mid-20th c. Swiss Reformed, dialectical theology; essays crystallizing Brunner's mature program: revelation as personal event.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Produced in the wake of WWI and the collapse of liberal optimism; within the dialectical or neo-orthodox turn.
 - Interacts with existential personalism (Kierkegaard, Buber) and Reformed confessional streams; contemporaneous with the Brunner-Barth debate on natural theology and the orders of creation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Revelation is an event of divine address** wherein the living God encounters the human person in Jesus Christ by the Holy Spirit. Truth is not primarily propositions but **truth-as-encounter** that summons obedient faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Revelation and Word**: The Word of God is fundamentally God's self-communicative act in Christ; Scripture is **witness** and instrument of that act, becoming God's Word in the Spirit's present address.
 - **Human condition**: Humanity, made in the **imago Dei**, remains addressable (Ansprechbarkeit) despite radical sin; this is the controversial **point of contact**.
 - **Christology and soteriology**: The divine-human encounter is concentrated in the person and work of Christ; justification and reconciliation are personal events received in faith-as-obedience.
 - **Pneumatology**: The Spirit actualizes the encounter here-and-now through preaching and sacrament; no encounter without the Spirit's sovereign initiative.
 - **Covenant and church**: Covenant is a relational I-Thou reality established by God's promise; the church exists where the Word is heard and believed, and sacraments seal the promise as enacted Word.
 - **Creation and ethics**: God's **orders of creation** provide a creational framework for human life and responsibility, yet do not save or reveal God salvifically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Luther and Calvin; critically receives Schleiermacher and Ritschl; converses with Kierkegaard and Buber; debates Barth (Nein!), and dialogues at points with Bultmann.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology** (witness, authority-in-encounter), **Pneumatology** (actualization), **Soteriology** (justification as event), **Covenant theology** (relationality), **Ecclesiology & sacraments** (preaching/sacrament as media), **Anthropology & creation** (imago, orders, sin).
- **Center of gravity**
 - God creates responsible partners in covenant by personally addressing sinners in Christ through the Spirit, evoking faith that is obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Truth as encounter** rather than deposit; **revelation-as-event**; faith as decision in response to divine address.
 - Strong personalist framing: God meets persons, not spectators; relational ontology over metaphysical speculation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against classic Protestant scholasticism: resists identifying revelation with propositions or a text apart from the Spirit's living address.
 - Against liberalism: opposes immanentism and religious experience as source; insists on God's sovereign initiative and the scandal of the kerygma.
 - Nuanced alternative to Barth: affirms a minimal **point of contact** and **orders of creation**, while limiting natural knowledge to formal possibility; Barth replies with Nein!
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - **Anknuepfungspunkt** (point of contact), **addressability**, **encounter**, **event**, **I-Thou** relation applied theologically; sacraments as **enacted Word**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Shaped neo-orthodox preaching and catechesis; influential in kerygmatic theology and mid-century Reformed discussions of Scripture and Spirit.
 - Contested by conservative evangelicals over propositional truth and inerrancy; criticized by Barthians for natural theology concessions; appreciated in ecumenical dialogues for personalist covenantal emphasis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Scripture, preaching, and sacrament function as means of grace only in the Spirit's living act.
 - Offers a robust account of faith as obedient response within a covenantal, relational frame applicable across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation-as-event**: God's self-disclosure occurs as a personal act, not merely as information.
- **Truth as encounter**: Veritas happens in meeting God; knowledge is participatory and obedient.
- **Word of God / kerygma**: The proclaimed gospel by which God presently addresses; distinguished from but inseparable from Scripture.
 - Scripture is **witness** that becomes God's Word in the Spirit's use.
- **Holy Spirit (actualization)**: The agent who makes the encounter real here-and-now; guards against objectifying revelation.
- **Faith as obedience/decision**: Trustful yes to God's address; neither mere assent nor autonomous choice.
- **Imago Dei and addressability**: Despite sin, humans remain capable of being addressed; basis for responsibility and mission.
- **Anknuepfungspunkt (point of contact)**: Formal openness to God's Word rooted in the imago; not salvific knowledge.
- **Orders of creation**: Creational structures (family, work, state) that shape ethical life without mediating saving grace.
- **Covenant (I-Thou)**: Personal fellowship initiated by divine promise; the matrix of revelation and redemption.
- **Justification as event**: Forgiveness and reconciliation occur in the encounter with Christ, not as transferable substance.
- **Church as event-community**: Where Word and Spirit create hearing and faith; preaching centrally mediates the encounter.
- **Sacraments as enacted Word**: Visible promises that, in the Spirit, seal the same address of God given in the gospel.
- **Anti-objectification**: Refusal to reduce God to concepts, systems, or institutional control.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Bibliology**: Source for a witness- and Spirit-centered account of scriptural authority.
 - **Pneumatology**: Model of the Spirit's role in making revelation effective.
 - **Soteriology and covenant**: Framework for justification as personal event within relational promise.
 - **Ecclesiology & sacraments**: Rationale for preaching and sacrament as media of encounter, not mechanisms.
