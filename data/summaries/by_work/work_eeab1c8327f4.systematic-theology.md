### TITLE
Systematic Theology - John M. Frame (P&R, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical Reformed theology; late 20th-early 21st century milieu. Frame is rooted in Dutch Reformed thought, shaped by Cornelius Van Til (presuppositional apologetics) and the broader neo-Calvinist tradition, writing in conversation with popular modern Evangelical systematicians (e.g., Wayne Grudem) and classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Bavinck, Warfield).
 - Aims to supply a comprehensive, pastorally useful, philosophically informed systematic theology for Reformed evangelicals.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be explicitly God-centered: Scripture and God's self-revelation set the terms for doctrine, life, and apologetics. Theologically adequate method must hold together **normativity**, **situationality**, and **existentiality** (Frame's triperspectivalism).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organizes classic loci (Scripture, God, Trinity, Creation, Christ, Salvation, Church, Last Things) around a common methodological insistence: each locus should answer what God is (doctrine), how believers live (ethics/practice), and how truth is defended (apologetics).
 - Major moves:
 - Defend Scripture's authority, sufficiency, and clarity; integrate propositional revelation and incarnational revelation (Word and Word made flesh).
 - Present a robust doctrine of God that is both sovereign and personal, anchoring theology in divine lordship.
 - Apply triperspectival method broadly to doctrine, ethics, epistemology, and apologetics to avoid reductionism.
 - Synthesize systematic, biblical, historical, and philosophical resources to produce a coherent Reformed theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Cornelius Van Til (and presuppositional tradition), classical Reformed authors (Calvin, Bavinck), modern Reformed theologians (Warfield, Berkhof), and contemporary evangelicals (Grudem). Critiques neo-orthodoxy (Barth) and liberalism; dialogues with analytic philosophy where helpful.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology, Theology Proper, Trinity, Christology, Soteriology (including penal substitution and election), Ecclesiology, Sacraments, Eschatology, Ethics (covenantal and relational emphases), Apologetics and epistemology.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame's Systematic Theology insists that **God's lordship and self-revelation must shape doctrine, life, and defense of the faith**, and that a triperspectival method best secures theological coherence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Triperspectivalism** (normative, situational, existential perspectives) as a pervasive methodological tool across all loci.
 - Strong integration of **apologetics into systematic theology**-apologetics is not an addendum but intrinsic to doctrinal work.
 - Emphasis on **God's lordship** as the central organizing principle: theology serves the Lord rather than merely describing beliefs.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques purely propositional or purely experiential approaches by synthesizing propositional revelation with personal, incarnational revelation.
 - Offers an alternative to popular evangelical manuals (e.g., Grudem) by stressing philosophical rigor and methodological clarity; challenges neo-orthodox Christocentrism by recovering full propositional authority of Scripture.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic and extended use of triperspectival categories applied beyond ethics to epistemology and theology proper.
 - Reframing of theological tasks as triadic: doctrinal articulation, existential appropriation, apologetic defense.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; valued for rigor and pastoral usefulness. Stimulated further discussion of triperspectivalism and apologetics within Reformed academic and pastoral contexts.
 - Received both praise for synthesis and critique for perceived complexity or novel terminology.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact, philosophically literate Reformed systematic useful for pastors, advanced students, and those seeking integration of doctrine and apologetics. Provokes methodological reflection within systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Triperspectivalism** - Normative (God/Scripture), Situational (world/facts), Existential (self/faith); method for balancing doctrine, practice, and defense.
- **God's lordship** - Central organizing theological category; every locus must answer to divine sovereignty and authority.
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - Epistemological posture rooted in Van Til; theology begins with God's self-revelation.
- **Scripture as Word** - Distinction and unity of Scripture (written Word) and Christ (incarnate Word); affirms propositional truth within relational revelation.
- **Covenant theology** - Covenantal framework for salvation history and ecclesiology (continuity of covenant of grace).
- **Penal substitution** - Affirmed as central to atonement within a Reformed soteriology.
- **Trinity / relations of origin** - Robust trinitarian ontology stressing relationality and personal communion within God.
- **Providence & responsibility** - Compatibilist account of divine sovereignty and human moral responsibility.
- **Apologetic theology** - Integration of defense with doctrine as inseparable tasks of theology.
- **Normative-situational-existential questions** - Each theological locus examined through what God commands, what the situation is, and how persons respond.
- **Inerrancy / sufficiency of Scripture** - Defense of classical evangelical bibliology.
- **Theological method** - Emphasis on philosophical clarity, historical awareness, and pastoral application.
- **Relational ontology** - Stress on persons and relations (esp. in trinitarian and ethical metaphysics).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological model** for integrating doctrine, ethics, and apologetics (conceptual pivot).
 - As a **reference** for Reformed positions on bibliology, Trinity, Christology, and soteriology (definition source).
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist approaches (both liberal and purely devotional) and against isolated apologetic or ethical systems.
