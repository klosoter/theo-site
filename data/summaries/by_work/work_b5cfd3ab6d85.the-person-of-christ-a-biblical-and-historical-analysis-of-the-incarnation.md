### TITLE
**The Person of Christ: A Biblical and Historical Analysis of the Incarnation** - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed milieu reacting to modernist and liberal reductions of doctrine, and to experiential/pastoral pietism that downplayed doctrinal precision.
 - Situated within a broader recovery of classical theology in evangelical seminaries; attentive to historical theology and confessional commitments.
 - Methodologically influenced by a conviction that theology should be disciplined, historically-informed, and propositional (cf. Principia: Theology As Science).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary Christianity has weakened the biblical and classical doctrine of the Incarnation; Wells argues for a recovery of a robust, historically-grounded christology that affirms the full reality of God becoming man without compromise.
 - The key problem is methodological: modern theology often substitutes functional or moral concepts of "Christ" for the ontological claim that the eternal Son assumed human nature.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: defense of biblical data that presents Jesus as both fully God and fully man.
 - Historical retrieval: tracing how the church historically articulated the Incarnation (patristic, Chalcedon, Augustine, medieval scholastics, Reformation).
 - Critical engagement: diagnosing modern errors - liberal demythologizing, existential reinterpretations, pietistic sentimentalism, and some modern evangelical functionalism.
 - Constructive proposal: reclaiming the Chalcedonian formula and an incarnational realism that preserves divine immutability and genuine human experience in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Athanasius, the Cappadocians, Augustine, the Alexandrian tradition, Chalcedonian formulations.
 - Reformation: Calvin and classical Reformed articulations of the God-man mediatorship.
 - Modern interlocutors: critiques of Schleiermacher, Bultmann, Tillich, and popular evangelical tendencies that emphasize function over person.
 - Methodological reference: aligns with the idea of theology as a rigorous, systematic science (see Principia Theology As Science).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word and Word-made-flesh), Trinity, Christology (person and natures), soteriology (atonement and mediation), incarnation, kenosis, and ecclesial implications.

- **Closing line**
 - A clarion call to recover a historically faithful, biblically grounded, and theologically rigorous doctrine of the Incarnation that preserves the mystery and salvific necessity of the Word become flesh.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **ontological** rather than merely functional Christology: the reality of the Word assuming human nature, not merely God's activity in Jesus.
 - Emphasis on the **historical continuity** of classical formulations as corrective to modern innovations.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal/existential denials of Christ's ontological divinity and humanity.
 - Contrasts with some modern evangelical moves that reduce Christ to exemplar, moral teacher, or Spirit-man without sustained metaphysical grounding.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys the phrase **"incarnational realism"** (implicit) to stress that the Incarnation is an ontic event, not a theological metaphor.
 - Recasts kenosis debates toward a balance that preserves divine immutability and genuine human limitation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a corrective and teaching text; used in courses on historical theology and christology.
 - Criticized occasionally for polemical tone toward liberal scholarship and for privileging doctrinal continuity over constructive novelty.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between biblical exegesis and the classical formulations; durable for apologetic use, catechesis, and formation in orthodox christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - The eternal Son's assuming of true human nature; central real event, not merely symbol or moral example.
- **Hypostatic Union** - The union of two natures in one Person; Wells defends its necessity against functional readings.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The standard benchmark; used as the non-negotiable summary of orthodox Christology.
- **Person of Christ** - Focus on the unique personhood (theos + anthropos) as the site of mediation and revelation.
- **Two Natures (divine and human)** - Affirmation that both natures are complete and unconfused; used to resist reductionist accounts.
- **Mediator** - Christ as the unique bridge between God and humanity; ontological basis for atonement and revelation.
- **Atonement (substitutionary emphasis)** - Treated as grounded in the real union of the divine and human in Christ, enabling penal and vicarious dimensions.
- **Kenosis** - Examined to avoid notions that the Son ceased to be divine; seen as self-limitation in action, not ontological loss.
- **Revelation (Word-made-flesh)** - Jesus as the definitive self-disclosure of God; doctrine of Scripture and Christ tightly linked.
- **Incarnational realism** - Term capturing Wells' posture: the Incarnation is an ontological event with salvific consequences.
- **Historical theology** - Methodological commitment to use the church's received formulations as corrective and guide.
- **Theological method (Principia: Theology As Science)** - Emphasis on disciplined, propositional, historically informed theology as a science-like enterprise.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for orthodox Christology in syllabi and lectures.
 - As **polemic** against liberal, existential, and reductionist christologies.
 - As an **exegetical-model** that links biblical texts with historical formulations to teach systematic doctrine.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for courses on incarnation and atonement, especially within Reformed evangelical settings.
