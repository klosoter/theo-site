### TITLE
Acts: An Exegetical Commentary (2012-2015) - Craig S. Keener

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Four-volume, exhaustive exegetical commentary on Acts written 2012-2015; situated within late-20th/early-21st-century evangelical scholarship marked by renewed interest in Luke-Acts, pneumatology, and the charismatic renewal.
 - Method: dense use of primary sources (Jewish, Greco-Roman, patristic, extra-biblical Christian), social-scientific and historical-contextual reading combined with theological reflection.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Luke presents the Spirit as the central, continuing agent of mission and covenant continuity: the Spirit empowers, legitimates, and guides the church's expansion; charismatic gifts and signs are normative in redemptive history rather than merely transitional.
 - The doctrinal problem addressed: continuity vs. discontinuity in the Spirit's activity (are charismatic gifts normative or temporary?) and the relation of Luke's pneumatology to later ecclesial theologies.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Verse-by-verse exegesis with sustained thematic strands across volumes:
 - The Spirit as the driving force of the narrative (Acts 1-2, Pentecost).
 - Spirit and mission: how pneumatology structures apostolic activity and Gentile inclusion.
 - Signs, wonders, miracles and the normative expectation of Spirit-empowered ministry.
 - Paul and the Spirit: theological synthesis of pneumatology across Acts.
 - Integrates historical background to illuminate Luke's choices (Jewish traditions, Hellenistic contexts, Greco-Roman religiosity).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Luke-Acts narrative; secondary: early church fathers, Philo, Josephus, rabbinic literature, Greco-Roman miracle literature.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: scholars across the spectrum (e.g., Marshall, Fitzmyer, Dunn, Bock), and both cessationist and continuationist theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central), ecclesiology (apostolic authority, mission), soteriology (conversion narratives), covenant/continuity (Israel and church), miracles/signs, hermeneutics of narrative.

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - Keener reads Acts as a sustained theological-historical claim that the Spirit is the ongoing, normative power of redemptive mission, validating both charismatic phenomena and Luke's vision of covenantal continuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Massive evidential support from a wide range of ancient sources to show that Luke's portrayal of the Spirit aligns with ancient expectations of spirit-empowerment and miracle-working.
 - Consistent portrayal of the Spirit as missionally decisive rather than merely celebratory or mystical.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges cessationist readings that treat signs and gifts as purely "temporary"; argues Luke shows continuation and normalization of gifts in the life of the church.
 - Offers corrective nuance to readings that isolate Luke from Jewish continuity: stresses Luke's attempts to interpret Jesus and the Spirit within Israel's scriptural story.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Frames Luke's pneumatology as a model of "redemptive-historical continuity" where gift-charisma functions within covenant continuity rather than as an aberration.
 - Emphasizes sociological categories (authority, patronage, communal identity) in interpreting Spirit-events.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among evangelicals and Pentecostal scholars as an authoritative, defense-quality resource for continuationist pneumatology.
 - Provoked careful re-engagement by Reformed and cessationist scholars; used in debates over contemporary charismatic practice.

- **Enduring value**
 - A standard reference for exegesis of Acts; indispensable for courses on Luke-Acts, pneumatology, and mission history; valuable for pastors, scholars, and those engaging in the continuationism vs cessationism debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Spirit in redemptive history**
 - Keener: Spirit as continuous agent from Israel's story into the church's mission; not a late interruption but fulfillment.

- **Continuationism**
 - Interprets Acts as normative evidence that charismatic gifts continue; Keener argues for ongoing presence and function of gifts.

- **Cessationism**
 - Treated critically: Keener engages cessationist arguments exegetically and historically, challenging claims that gifts ceased with apostolic era.

- **Charismatic gifts**
 - Understood as integral to Luke's depiction of apostolic ministry (prophecy, tongues, healing, miracles).

- **Signs and wonders**
 - Normative in Acts' narrative logic; function as validation of gospel and mission.

- **Luke-Acts pneumatology**
 - Central category: unity of Father, Son, Spirit in mission; Spirit empowers witness and legitimates Gentile inclusion.

- **Mission**
 - Mission driven and defined by the Spirit; conversion, baptism, and Spirit-possession are mission markers.

- **Jewish-Gentile continuity**
 - Keener stresses Luke's theological program to show continuity with Israel while accommodating Gentile incorporation.

- **Social-scientific exegesis**
 - Uses social structures (honor, patronage, group identity) to interpret Spirit-events.

- **Ethnographic and ancient parallels**
 - Employs literature on ancient miracles and spirit phenomena to contextualize Acts' accounts.

- **Narrative theology**
 - Treats Acts as theological story that shapes doctrinal claims about the Spirit through plot and action.

- **Exegetical model**
 - Keener's method: exhaustive primary-source corroboration plus verse-level exegesis.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for Luke-Acts pneumatology and the Spirit's role in mission.
 - As a **polemic resource** against cessationism and for contemporary charismatic practice.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating ancient contextual data into theological reading of Scripture.
