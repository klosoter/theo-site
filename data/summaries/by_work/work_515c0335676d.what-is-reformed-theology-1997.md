### TITLE
What Is Reformed Theology? (1997) - R. C. Sproul

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1997 amid a late-20th-century resurgence of confessional Reformed interest in evangelicalism; associated with Ligonier Ministries' educational emphases and a pastoral apologetic posture.
 - A popular, concise primer aimed at educated laity, pastors, and students rather than specialized scholars.

- **Central thesis**
 - Reformed theology is a coherent, Scripturally rooted system shaped primarily by the doctrine of God's absolute sovereignty and the correlative doctrines of sin and grace; its aim is right thinking about God that leads to faithful worship and life.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opens from the doctrine of God (attributes, sovereignty) and moves to human sin (Total Depravity / Total Inability), then to redemptive response (Christ, atonement, election, grace), and to the church and means of grace.
 - Major logical moves:
 - Establish divine revelation and sola Scriptura as the normative rule.
 - Show anthropological ruin (total depravity) to justify divine initiative in salvation.
 - Explain election and particular grace as consistent with divine justice and mercy.
 - Present sacraments, covenantal relationships, and church life as rooted in redemptive history.
 - Emphasizes clarity, pastoral application, and defenses against common objections (moral, philosophical, and pastoral).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Retrieves classical Reformers (Calvin), the Reformed confessional tradition (Westminster and continental streams), and patristic/medieval antecedents when helpful.
 - Implicitly contrasts with Arminian, pietistic, liberal, and certain revivalist treatments of salvation; interacts with modern skepticism about divine sovereignty.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (sufficiency, clarity)
 - God (attributes, sovereignty, providence)
 - Sin (emphasis on **Total Depravity** and **Total Inability**)
 - Christology (substitutionary atonement, priestly office)
 - Soteriology (election, grace, justification, perseverance)
 - Covenant theology and sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper)
 - Ecclesiology and Christian life (means of grace, worship)

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - Reformed theology, at its heart, is a theology that exalts the sovereignty of God and insists that redemption is initiated and secured by God in Christ because humans, owing to total depravity and inability, cannot effect their own salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Plainspoken insistence on the primacy of divine sovereignty as pastoral and apologetic - God rules even in mercy.
 - Vivid, pastoral articulation of human inability: sin affects the will so that divine grace must be decisive.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects revivalist/therapeutic portrayals of conversion that minimize sin and divine initiative.
 - Stands in polemical contrast to Arminian emphases on human ability and synergistic salvation; also contrasts with liberal theology that downplays sin and substitutionary atonement.

- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reframes classic Reformed loci in accessible language without sacrificing doctrinal density; stresses **Total Inability** as the practical corollary to Total Depravity.
 - Avoids abstruse scholasticism while keeping fidelity to confessional categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as an introductory text in churches, Bible studies, and some evangelical seminaries; contributed to popular Reformed formation in the late 1990s onward.
 - Bolstered Ligonier's catechetical and apologetic influence; frequently cited in popular theological formation.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Reliable, concise exposition of core Reformed commitments suitable for introduction, catechesis, and pastoral training.
 - Valuable exemplar of how to defend and apply Reformed doctrines in contemporary pastoral contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sovereignty of God**
 - Central organizing category; God rules over creation, history, and salvation.
- **Sola Scriptura**
 - Scripture as the final rule and norm for faith and practice.
- **Total Depravity**
 - Human nature corrupted in all faculties; sin pervasive and foundational.
- **Total Inability**
 - Because of depravity, humans are unable to seek God or undertake saving faith without divine aid.
- **Election / Predestination**
 - God's eternal choice as the ground of salvation, portrayed as consistent with justice and mercy.
- **Substitutionary Atonement**
 - Christ dies in the sinner's place; penal, objective dimensions emphasized.
- **Justification by Faith / Imputation**
 - Righteousness of Christ credited to believers; forensic declaration central.
- **Covenant Theology**
 - Redemptive history organized by covenants; sacramental signs function within covenant life.
- **Means of Grace**
 - Word and sacraments as ordinary instruments of sanctification and communion with Christ.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance includes permissive and ordering activity in creation.
- **Perseverance of the Saints**
 - Final perseverance as assurance grounded in God's preserving work.
- **Common Grace**
 - God's general benevolence to mankind that restrains sin and fosters cultural good.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **concise definitional source** for what counts as Reformed theology in catechesis and parish education.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminian, liberal, and revivalist distortions of sin and grace.
 - As a **pedagogical model** for teaching classical Reformed soteriology and the centrality of divine sovereignty in practical theology.
