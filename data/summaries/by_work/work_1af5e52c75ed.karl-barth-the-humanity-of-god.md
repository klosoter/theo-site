### TITLE
Karl Barth: The Humanity of God

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Written in the interwar period (Barth's formative neo-orthodox phase after his Romans commentary and during development toward the Church Dogmatics). Responds to liberal Protestantism, Ritschlian ethics, and modern attempts to domesticate God; arises within Reformed dialectical theology and the crisis of biblical authority in early 20th-century Europe.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The decisive claim is that God's true humanity is disclosed only in the incarnation of Jesus Christ; to speak rightly of the Imago Dei and of human nature one must begin with God's self-revelation, not with human experience or natural theology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - God is known only when God chooses to reveal himself; revelation is historically located in Christ (Christocentrism as hermeneutical principle).
 - The "humanity of God" is not an anthropomorphic projection but the claim that in the Word-made-flesh God assumes genuine human existence (real participation in human life, suffering, obedience).
 - Human beings bear the image of God only insofar as they are related to the revealed God in Christ; Imago Dei is relational and vocational, not primarily ontological capacity.
 - This denies any autonomous natural theology or ethical theology that bases God or the image of God on human subjectivity, reason, or moral consensus.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scriptural exegesis (esp. Pauline and Johannine Christology); contrasts with Schleiermacher, Ritschl, and liberal Protestant theologians who ground theology in religious experience; constructive appropriation of Luther and Calvin on the priority of revealed Word; anticipates later debates with Emil Brunner over natural theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Word of God), Christology (incarnation, obedience, suffering), Imago Dei (theology of humanity), doctrine of God (transcendence and immanence), atonement/reconciliation, implicitly Trinitarian concerns (relation of Word to Father and Spirit as presupposition).
- **Closing line:** Barth centers theology on the paradox that God's true humanity is the revelatory and saving fact of the incarnation: humans are made in God's image only insofar as they are addressed and remade by the incarnate Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Puts the incarnate, historical Christ absolutely at the origin of any correct talk about both God and human beings.
 - Recasts Imago Dei as a status mediated by revelation and vocation rather than an innate, autonomous human capacity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Polemical correction of liberalism: rejects the reduction of God to human feeling, ethical ideals, or natural religion.
 - Rejection of unqualified analogia entis (natural analogy of being); knowledge of God is not an extension of self-knowledge but a divine gift.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The paradoxical phrase "the humanity of God" foregrounds divine solidarity with human life as theological principle rather than rhetorical figure.
 - Emphasizes revelation as event and person (Jesus) rather than merely propositional content.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Central text for neo-orthodoxy and mid-20th-century Reformed renewal; influenced subsequent Christocentric anthropology, liberation theologians (in emphasis on divine solidarity), and debates on divine passibility and suffering.
 - Sparked methodological debates about natural theology, the locus of revelation, and the priority of God's action over human religious experience.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies how Christology reorients theological anthropology and ethics.
 - Provides a robust corrective to naturalistic and anthropocentric accounts of God and the image of God.
 - Serves as a pedagogical pivot for introducing revelation-centered doctrine of humanity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The Humanity of God:** Barth's central paradox: God is truly human only in the person of Jesus Christ; this is the decisive revelation for theology.
- **Imago Dei (Image of God):** Not a natural quality but a status and vocation conditioned by relation to the revealed God in Christ.
 - Contrast: Barth rejects naturalistic/ontological readings that make Imago Dei a human capacity independent of revelation.
- **Revelation:** God's self-disclosure as historical and Christological; the epistemic ground of all theology.
- **Incarnation (Word made flesh):** The event in which God assumes human existence; the decisive locus for knowing both God and true humanity.
- **Christocentrism:** Methodological principle: Christ is the single, controlling norm for doctrine and anthropology.
- **Analogia entis / Natural Theology:** Treated negatively; Barth opposes a reliance on natural analogies or human reason as a valid path to God.
- **Divine Transcendence and Immanence:** Held together dialectically - God remains Other yet is present in genuine human life in Christ.
- **Reconciliation / Atonement:** Implicitly receives central importance: God's humanity includes suffering and obedience, the basis for reconciling action.
- **Scripture as Witness/Testimony:** Scripture is authoritative because it bears witness to the revelation of the incarnate Word; not primarily a moral or cultural document.
- **Hypostatic Union:** Understood as the absolute basis for saying God participates in human existence without loss of deity.
- **Theological Anthropology:** Human identity is definable only in relation to Christ; anthropology is derivative from Christology.
- **Divine Suffering/Passibility:** Barth's language opens room for speaking of God's real participation in suffering through the incarnation.
- **Doctrine of God (Freedom and Election):** God's self-determining election is expressed in the concrete act of becoming human.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for a Christ-centered Imago Dei in systematic theology and ethics.
 - As a **polemic** against liberal and natural theology in debates over revelation and method.
 - As an **exegetical/constructive model** for reorienting anthropology, soteriology, and pastoral theology around the incarnate Word.
