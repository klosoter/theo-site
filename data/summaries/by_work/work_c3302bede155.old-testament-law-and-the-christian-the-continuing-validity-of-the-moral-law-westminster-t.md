### TITLE
**Old Testament Law and the Christian: The Continuing Validity of the Moral Law** 
Richard B. Gaffin Jr., Westminster Theological Journal (article). 
A compact, theologically dense defense within Reformed covenantalism of the ongoing normative force of the moral law for Christians, read against antinomian and discontinuity readings.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th-century Reformed academic context (Westminster Theological Seminary milieu). 
 - Response to contemporary antinomian currents, pietistic minimizations of the law, and to dispensational/NT-only emphases that sharply sever Old Covenant law from Christian obligation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The Mosaic law does not nullify the moral law for Christians; the moral law continues in force because it expresses the eternal righteous character of God and is fulfilled, not abolished, in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Clarifies categories: distinguishes moral law from ceremonial and civil elements while problematizing simplistic tripartite separations. 
 - Argues from covenant theology: the Mosaic covenant relates to an earlier Covenant of Works "as to substance" (i.e., reiteration of God's holy requirement), but is placed under the economy of the Covenant of Grace. 
 - Exegetical appeal to NT witnesses (Paul, especially Romans and Galatians; also Christ's teaching) to show continuity of moral demand, reinterpreted in Christ's person and work. 
 - Functional consequences: the law's uses (convicting sin, restraining evil, guiding Christian obedience) remain operative with the gospel-centred modifications of motive and means (grace, Spirit). 
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicit and explicit dialogue with Westminster divines and classical federal theologians; critique of modern antinomians and some streams of dispensationalism; engagement with exegetical literature on Pauline theology. 
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Covenant theology (Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace), law and gospel distinction, Christology as fulfillment, justification/imputation, sanctification, revelation (law as revelation of God's character).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - The moral law endures as the normative expression of God's holy will, reinterpreted and secured in Christ so that Christians obey not as law‑bound covenant‑slaves but as redeemed subjects guided by the Spirit and bound to the law's righteous standard.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Careful insistence on continuity: the Mosaic law reiterates the Covenant of Works' demands "as to substance," while being situated within the Covenant of Grace - preserving both God's unchanging moral standard and the gospel's transformative provisions. 
 - Balances the law's abiding normative force with Christocentric reinterpretation: fulfillment in Christ does not dissolve moral obligation but relocates its grounding in God's redemptive act.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects antinomian tendencies that read Pauline texts as abolishing moral norms. 
 - Pushes back against simplistic threefold law divisions when they risk downgrading the law's theological unity and covenantal function.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Nuanced use of "Covenant of Works as to substance" to explain how Mosaic exhortations retain the original divine demand without forcing a return to works‑righteousness. 
 - Integrates classical uses of the law with covenantal recalibration rather than mere repetition.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed scholarship defending the third use of the law and covenantal continuity; influential in seminarians' formation and in polemics against antinomian readings. 
 - Served as a model for combining careful exegesis with systematic fidelity in later Reformed treatments.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Offers a compact, theologically integrative corrective to reductions of the law; valuable for preaching, catechesis, and graduate-level instruction in covenant theology and Pauline hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mosaic Covenant:** The covenant at Sinai; analyzed for which of its prescriptions are morally binding on Christians and how it relates to earlier covenants. 
- **Covenant of Works (as to substance):** The original divine requirement of perfect obedience; Gaffin contends the Mosaic law reiterates this substance without re-establishing legalism. 
- **Moral Law:** The eternal, God‑rooted standard of righteousness that continues to bind Christians as normative for life. 
- **Ceremonial/Civil Distinctions:** Recognized but critiqued when they obscure the unity and covenantal function of the law; ceremonial elements point typologically to Christ. 
- **Law Fulfilled in Christ:** Fulfillment means removal of condemnation and establishment of the law's goal in Christ, not abolition of moral obligation. 
- **Law and Gospel Relationship:** Gospel does not negate law's normative content but relocates its motive and means in grace and Spirit‑enabled obedience. 
- **Uses of the Law:** 
 - Pedagogical/convicting (shows sin), 
 - Civil/restraining (public order), 
 - Normative/third use (guide for Christian life) - Gaffin defends continued relevance, properly reinterpreted in redemptive context. 
- **Typology and Fulfillment:** Ceremonial law points to Christ's work; typology secures continuity without confounding covenantal economies. 
- **Imputation & Sanctification:** Law exposes need for Christ whose righteousness is imputed; sanctification aligns believers to the law's ethical demands by the Spirit. 
- **Antinomianism:** Target of critique; the article functions polemically to restrain tendencies that deny moral normativity. 
- **Redemptive‑Historical Reading:** Uses redemptive‑historical method to show development and continuity of law across covenants.

How this work is used: 
- As a concise definition source for the doctrine of the moral law within Reformed covenant theology. 
- As polemical ammunition against antinomian and disruptive discontinuity readings of Pauline texts. 
- As an exegetical-model exemplar integrating Pauline exegesis with systematic theology and covenantal categories.
