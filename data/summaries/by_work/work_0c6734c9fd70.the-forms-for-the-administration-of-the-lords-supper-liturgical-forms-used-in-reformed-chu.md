### TITLE
The Forms for the Administration of the Lord's Supper (Reformed liturgical forms associated with the Three Forms of Unity)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Arises in the Reformed confessional tradition (post-Reformation, 16th-17th c.) and later Dutch Reformed liturgical practice; commonly circulated alongside the Three Forms of Unity (Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession, Canons of Dort) or within church order collections.
 - Reflects pastoral and polemical needs: to regularize eucharistic practice against Roman Catholic sacramentalism and against extremes of memorialism or lax admission.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to administer the Lord's Supper so that the sacrament communicates Christ and his benefits without error: preserving both the real, spiritual reception of Christ and the necessity of Word, faith, and covenantal order; and protecting the table through disciplined admission.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Liturgical sequence that embodies theology:
 - **Exhortation and call to self-examination** (confession, repentance, assurance).
 - **Reading of institution** (Words of Institution; biblical narrative).
 - **Prayer of consecration / thanksgiving** (union of Word and sacrament stressed).
 - **Distribution** (bread and wine administered; often with accompanying brief exhortations).
 - **Admonitions concerning reception** (faith required; warning against unworthy reception).
 - **Closing thanksgiving/doxology and dismissal.**
 - Theological moves:
 - Assert that communicants receive Christ by faith through the sacrament (spiritual/real presence).
 - Stress the sacrament as covenant sign and seal, not a material change in elements.
 - Insist on pastoral oversight: catechetical preparation, fencing the table, and church discipline.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Reformed magisterial theology (John Calvin, Heinrich Bullinger, Martin Bucer) and the Heidelberg Catechism/Belgic Confession formulations.
 - Polemical interlocutors: Roman Catholic doctrines of sacramental presence (transubstantiation) and radical memorialists (who deny any real communicable benefit).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Sacramentology** (nature, signs, seals, efficacy)
 - **Christology** (presence of Christ in the Supper; spiritual communion)
 - **Covenant theology** (supper as covenant sign and means of sealing promises)
 - **Ecclesiology / discipline** (admission, fencing the table)
 - **Soteriology / sanctification** (benefits received in faith)

- **Closing line**
 - The Forms articulate a confessional Reformed middle way: the Lord's Supper is a covenantal sign and seal through which communicants, by faith and under Word and order, spiritually feed on Christ - guarded by pastoral examination and disciplined admission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the union of **Word and sacrament**: the elements are means by which Christ is truly, spiritually received.
 - Clear, practical rules for **fencing the table**-not to exclude charity but to protect the sacrament's integrity and communicants' souls.
 - Stress on **faith as the instrument** of receiving sacramental benefit (not mere ritual participation).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicitly rejects **transubstantiation** (no physical change of elements) while also opposing a purely **memorialist** or merely symbolic account that denies real spiritual benefit.
 - Counters antinomian or indiscriminate open-table practices by reasserting catechetical preparation and moral/pastoral qualification.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Formalization of **"fencing the table"** as liturgical-pastoral practice.
 - Use of phraseology like **"communion with the body and blood of Christ by faith"** to capture the Reformed real-but-spiritual presence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard liturgical-theological model in Dutch Reformed and many Presbyterian contexts; influenced catechetical practice and eucharistic frequency debates in later centuries.
 - Served as a touchstone in intra-Protestant controversies (19th-20th c.) over open vs. closed communion and sacramental realism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, usable synthesis of Reformed sacramental theology for worship planning, pastoral care, and confessional teaching; still used as a template in liturgical reform and ecumenical comparison.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper** - the sacrament appointed by Christ for believers to remember, seal, and receive covenant blessings.
- **Sacrament / sign and seal** - visible sign (bread/wine) that seals God's promises to believers.

- **Words of Institution** - the biblical text invoked as the sacramental warrant and power of the rite.
- **Consecration / thanksgiving prayer** - liturgical action that unites Word and elements without implying metaphysical change.
