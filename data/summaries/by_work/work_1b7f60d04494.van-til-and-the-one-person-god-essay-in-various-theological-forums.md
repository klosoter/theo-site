### TITLE
Van Til and the One Person God - Fred Sanders (essay)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century conversation within conservative Reformed theology and apologetics. Engages the legacy of Cornelius Van Til and the Van Tillian presuppositional school (Bahnsen, Frame) against a backdrop of renewed patristic Trinitarian retrieval.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sanders diagnoses and critiques the rhetorical and theological effects of Van Til's repeated claim that God is a "one person," arguing that the phrase is ambiguous, easily misunderstood as modalistic, and inadequately distinguishes the classical notions of divine unity and triunity.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposites Van Til's usage: traces where and why Van Til speaks of a "one person God" (apologetic strategy stressing revelation's simplicity and singleness).
 - Analyses categories: separates Van Til's epistemological aims (how God is known and confessed) from metaphysical claims about God's inner life.
 - Diagnoses risks: shows how person-language deployed by Van Til can collapse hypostatic distinctions and invite modalist readings.
 - Proposes corrective moves: insists on preserving classical patristic terms (ousia/hypostasis; economic vs. immanent Trinity) and on careful analogical use of "person."
 - Recommends a charitable, constrained reading of Van Til that preserves his apologetic insights while correcting terminological slippage.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Cornelius Van Til and secondary representatives of Van Tillian apologetics (e.g., Greg Bahnsen, John Frame).
 - Patristic and classical Trinitarian sources consulted implicitly or explicitly (Athanasius, Cappadocians) as normative foil.
 - Contemporary Trinitarian revival figures and analytic theologians are brought in to clarify terms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central): one God in three persons; distinction between ousia and hypostasis; economic vs. immanent Trinity.
 - Revelation and epistemology: how God is given and known; implications of presuppositional method for Trinitarian language.
 - Divine simplicity and personhood: interaction between ontological simplicity and personal distinctions.
- **Closing line**
 - Sanders insists: one must affirm God's singular, simple being without forfeiting clear, orthodox distinction of three hypostases-thereby rescuing classical Trinitarian language from epistemological reductionism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes the *category-shift* from apologetic/epistemic claims to ontological claims: language suitable for polemic is not automatically adequate for doctrine.
 - Stresses the pastoral and confessional dangers of ambiguous person-talk in confessional contexts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Van Til's rhetoric where it risks modalism; contrasts Van Tilian insistence on a single conscious center with patristic insistence on three distinct hypostases sharing one ousia.
 - Argues that Van Til's presuppositional commitments explain but do not justify terminological departures from classical Trinitarian formulations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No radical neologisms; instead, Sanders proposes disciplined terminological hygiene: consistently mark the difference between epistemic statements about revelation and ontological statements about God's inner life.
 - Reframes "one person" as a rhetorical shorthand to be replaced by more precise language (one divine being in three persons).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively among those concerned to preserve orthodox Trinitarianism within conservative Reformed circles.
 - Functioned as a corrective reference for younger evangelical Trinitarians and as a bridge between Van Tillian apologetics and patristic Trinitarian scholarship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a careful hermeneutic of an influential apologist; warns theologians to keep apologetic method from reshaping doctrine; models charitable but critical engagement with a theological ancestor.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"One person God"**
 - Van Til's contested phrase; Sanders reads it as an apologetic shorthand that must be restrained or reformulated to avoid modalism.
- **Person / Hypostasis**
 - Clarified as distinct centers of personal identity in God; Sanders upholds patristic usage against psychological or singular-subject readings.
- **Ousia (being / substance)**
 - The one divine being shared by three hypostases-central corrective term Sanders urges recovery of.
- **Divine simplicity**
 - Van Til's appeal point for unity; Sanders insists simplicity must be held without erasing personhood distinctions.
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Van Til's epistemic framework; explains why Van Til stressed unity of God as the ultimate presupposition for knowledge and apologetics.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Sanders uses this distinction to show how revelation (economic) language can be misapplied to assertions about God's inner life (immanent).
- **Modalism**
 - The heretical error Sanders warns Van Til's language may occasion; helps define the boundary of acceptable reformulation.
- **Analogy and analogical predication**
 - Sanders recommends careful analogical talk about God, resisting both univocity and equivocity in assertions about personhood.
- **Revelation as personal self-disclosure**
 - Key to Van Til's apologetics; Sanders accepts the insight but insists on preserving Trinitarian form in how that self-disclosure is described.
- **Rhetorical vs. Doctrinal language**
 - Primary methodological distinction Sanders advances: polemical shorthand must be disciplined by doctrinal precision.
- **Psychological analogies**
 - Critiqued as inadequate for explaining intra-Trinitarian relations when overextended.
- **Patristic retrieval**
 - Sanders leans on patristic categories as corrective resources for modern Reformed terminology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for careful, confessional distinctions between one divine being and three persons.
- As a **polemic** correcting Van Tillian shorthand that risks modalism while preserving presuppositional insight.
- As an **exegetical/terminological model** for teachers and students needing disciplined language about the economic and immanent Trinity.
