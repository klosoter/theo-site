### TITLE
Against Calvinism: Responding to the Gospel Coalition, by Roger E. Olson (Baker Academic, 2011). 
A concise, popular-level Arminian critique directed at contemporary Reformed apologists and the resurgence of strict Calvinism in evangelicalism.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published amid the early 21st-century resurgence of Reformed theology in North American evangelicalism (notably the Gospel Coalition, young, confessional Reformed networks, and popular Calvinist authors). 
 - Olson writes as a systematic theologian and historic Arminian evangelical responding to a public, pastoral debate about doctrine and ecclesial culture.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Calvinism, as commonly articulated today (and historically in its classical forms), misrepresents the nature of God and Scripture by overemphasizing determinative divine sovereignty and denying genuine human freedom and universal salvific intentions.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Diagnoses contemporary Calvinism's key claims (TULIP formulations) and their pastoral implications. 
 - Reconstructs Arminian alternatives: prevenient grace, conditional election, resistible grace, and a view of foreknowledge that does not entail deterministic predestination. 
 - Appeals to biblical exegesis, historical theology, philosophical considerations (freedom and moral responsibility), and pastoral consequences (assurance, evangelism, image of God). 
 - Concludes by urging a theological middle path that preserves divine sovereignty without determinism and upholds God's universal salvific will.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Contemporary Reformed leaders and writers (e.g., John Piper, R.C. Sproul, Mark Dever and networks such as the Gospel Coalition) and classical Calvinist formulations (Calvin, Dort, Westminster). 
 - Appeals to Arminius, Wesleyan interpreters, and broader evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Election and predestination, atonement (limited vs. universal intent), grace and human freedom, providence and divine sovereignty, assurance and perseverance, biblical authority and hermeneutics, pastoral theology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - The book centers on the claim that a robust doctrine of God's love and non-coercive grace better fits Scripture, Christian tradition, moral responsibility, and pastoral life than the determinist conclusions of strict Calvinism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong stress on the moral character of God (especially divine love) as decisive for doctrinal evaluation. 
 - Persistent linking of doctrinal positions to tangible pastoral outcomes (evangelism, assurance, view of God).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Challenges classical Calvinist insistence on metaphysical determinism and double predestination; reinterprets key proof-texts to allow for genuine human freedom and conditional election. 
 - Pushes back against Calvinist pastoral rhetoric that may foster fatalism or a diminished missionary impulse.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Less innovation in technical terms than reassertion and popular framing of historic Arminian categories for contemporary debates; reframes Calvinist claims as culturally consequential rather than merely doctrinally abstruse.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely cited among Arminian and moderate evangelicals as an accessible rebuttal to modern Reformed popularizers; criticized by Reformed scholars for caricature and selective exegesis. 
 - Functioned as a conversation-starter in popular and church-level discussions; limited impact on academic Reformed scholarship but significant in denominational and pastoral contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Useful compact introduction to Arminian counterarguments and pastoral implications of soteriological systems; valuable for classes on contemporary doctrinal controversies and for pastors navigating polarized congregational debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Calvinism:** umbrella term here for doctrines summarized by TULIP; target of Olson's critique. 
- **TULIP:** mnemonic for Total depravity, Unconditional election, Limited atonement, Irresistible grace, Perseverance of the saints - each examined and contested. 
 - **Total depravity:** accepted in a modified sense but argued against deterministic consequences. 
 - **Unconditional election:** denied; Olson promotes conditional/foreknowledge-based election. 
 - **Limited atonement:** challenged as incompatible with texts expressing universal salvific will. 
 - **Irresistible grace:** rejected in favor of resistible or prevenient grace. 
 - **Perseverance:** reframed in Arminian terms of conditional security.
- **Prevenient grace:** key Arminian category Olson affirms - grace enabling a genuine human response without coercion. 
- **Foreknowledge:** argued to be relational/knowing that presupposes decision rather than necessitating causation of election. 
- **Divine sovereignty:** reinterpreted to allow libertarian human freedom; sovereignty as relational governance, not exhaustive causal determinism. 
- **Double predestination:** critiqued as morally and theologically problematic. 
- **Compatibilism vs. libertarian freedom:** Olson leans toward robust libertarian freedom as necessary for moral responsibility and genuine love. 
- **Atonement scope:** advocates for a universal or sufficiently objective atonement intent rather than strictly limited atonement. 
- **Theodicy and pastoral consequence:** used to question Calvinism's implications for the problem of evil and pastoral trust.
- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a concise Arminian definition source and public-polemic primer against modern Calvinism. 
 - As a pedagogical tool in systematic theology and pastoral courses to explore practical implications of soteriological systems. 
 - As a conversational pivot in church debates - less an exegetical manual than a pastoral and theological corrective.
