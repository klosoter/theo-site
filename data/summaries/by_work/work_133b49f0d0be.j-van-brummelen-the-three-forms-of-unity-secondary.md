### TITLE
J. van Brummelen, The Three Forms of Unity (secondary) - study of the Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, and Canons of Dort with attention to Means of Grace, Preaching, Sacraments, Prayer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th to early-21st century Reformed secondary literature that interprets classic Dutch Reformed confessions for pastoral and catechetical use; written within the confessional Reformed milieu that seeks to apply historic formularies to contemporary worship and ministry concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the Three Forms function as a unified pastoral-theological program that locates the church's life and assurance in the covenantal mediation of grace through Word, sacraments, preaching, and prayer; the work seeks to retrieve and explicate this integrated means-of-grace framework against both sacramental overreach and purely symbolic reductions.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical exposition of each Form with pastoral correlation:
 - **Heidelberg Catechism:** catechesis, Lord's Day structure, assurance, prayer as congregational piety.
 - **Belgic Confession:** doctrinal anchors-Scripture, sacraments, church office-shaping worship and sacraments.
 - **Canons of Dort:** soteriological foundations (election, assurance) that underpin sacramental promise and preaching.
 - Theological synthesis: Word as primary instrument; sacraments as **seals** and **means**; preaching as sacramental act; prayer as corollary participation in covenant life.
 - Practical application: liturgy, catechesis, sacramental administration, pastoral assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin and the Reformed orthodox; Dort divines; later Reformed pastors and confessionalists; interlocutions with Roman Catholic sacramental theology and Zwinglian memorialism; appeals to Scripture as normative.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant theology, means of grace, Word, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), preaching, prayer, assurance of faith, church office and discipline, justification (as presupposition for sacramental reception).
- **Closing line:** The Three Forms, as read by van Brummelen, present a coherent covenantal ecclesiology in which preaching, sacraments, and prayer operate together as God-ordained instruments for effecting and confirming saving faith and assurance within the visible church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats preaching explicitly as a primary sacramental instrument of grace (instrumental Word), not merely informational.
 - Stresses the Heidelberg Catechism's pedagogical ordering of congregational piety (Lord's Day as formative rhythm).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic tendencies to locate intrinsic efficacy in sacraments apart from faith and Word.
 - Counters Zwinglian and modern symbolic reductions by affirming sacramental signs as real seals of covenant promises.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Implies an integrated rubric: "means of grace triangulation" - Word (preaching), sign (sacrament), and response (prayer/faith) as a single pastoral economy.
 - Reframes assurance as a communal-covenantal fruit shaped by catechesis and sacramental practice.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used within confessional Reformed seminaries and churches for teaching worship theology, catechesis, and sacramental practice.
 - Influential in liturgical renewal movements within conservative Reformed contexts that seek recovery of confessional patterns.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Presents a compact, practice-oriented reading of the Three Forms that bridges doctrinal fidelity and pastoral application.
 - Serves as a pedagogical model for training pastors in preaching, sacramental administration, and catechetical ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Means of Grace:** God-ordained instruments through which He ordinarily imparts saving benefit; in this reading, emphatically Word + sacraments + prayer.
- **Word as Instrument:** preaching and Scripture functioning instrumentally to produce faith when accompanied by the Spirit.
- **Preaching (as sacramental):** public proclamation that functions as an appointed means of effectual grace, often called the "ministry of the Word."
- **Sacraments:** visible signs and seals of the covenant; efficacious insofar as they point to and seal Christ's promises to believers.
 - **Baptism:** sign and seal of incorporated covenant membership and promise of new life; used for infant and adult catechesis.
 - **Lord's Supper:** bread and wine as seal and nourishment of faith, administered to the covenant community.
- **Seals and Signs:** technical Reformed terms highlighting covenantal confirmation (seal) and representative sign (sign).
- **Prayer:** covenantal response and means by which believers receive and plead for covenant blessings; integrated with sacramental and preaching life.
- **Covenant Theology:** framework organizing sacraments, preaching, and prayer around God's covenantal dealings with His people.
- **Assurance:** pastoral and doctrinal concern; assurance is produced and confirmed through preached promises, catechesis, sacraments, and evidence of sanctification.
- **Instrumental Causality:** theological category describing how means (Word/sacraments) bring about faith by God's promise and Spirit.
- **Church (visible/invisible):** confessional distinctions invoked for proper administration of sacraments and discipline.
- **Regulative implications:** liturgical and ministerial practices judged by confessional standards.
- **Faith (receiving end):** not meritorious cause of sacraments, but the receptive instrument by which benefits are received.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental and preaching theology in seminary curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against both Roman sacramentalism and purely symbolic views (Anabaptist/Zwinglian).
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for organizing catechesis, liturgy, and pastoral ministry around the covenantal means of grace.
