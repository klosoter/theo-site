### TITLE
Christ Alone: The Uniqueness of Jesus as Savior (2017) - Stephen Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2017 amid renewed evangelical interest in classical Christology and debates over religious pluralism, soteriological exclusivism, and the proper relation of biblical theology to systematic formulation.
 - Situated in a conservative Reformed-evangelical milieu that emphasizes confessional orthodoxy and the authority of Scripture for doctrine.

- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus Christ is uniquely and exclusively the Savior: true God and true man, whose person and work constitute the only basis for salvation. Any attempt to relativize or functionalize his uniqueness undermines biblical and creedal Christology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful readings of key biblical texts that present Jesus as the one Mediator, Prophet, Priest, and King.
 - Historical-theological anchoring: appropriation of Chalcedonian and patristic categories to safeguard personal unity and twofold natures.
 - Systematic synthesis: integration of person (who Christ is) and work (what Christ accomplished) to argue for soteriological uniqueness.
 - Polemical moves: critique of pluralistic and inclusivist claims, and detailed rejection of certain modern kenotic formulations that impair the divine identity of the Son.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic and ecumenical creeds (Athanasius, Chalcedon) as normative touchstones.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include proponents of religious pluralism, functional Christologies, and proponents of kenotic theories; engages methodological debates between biblical theology and systematic theology.
 - Reformed and evangelical commentators as allies in upholding substitutionary atonement and high Christology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and christological self-disclosure in Scripture.
 - Trinity (economic and immanent relations) and the Son's divine identity.
 - Incarnation and the hypostatic union.
 - Soteriology: atonement (substitution, penal aspects), resurrection, and mediation.
 - Theological method: relation of biblical theology and systematic theology to doctrinal formulation.

- **Closing line**
 - Wellum locates the theological center of gravity in the personal unity of the divine Son who, without ceasing to be God, truly assumed humanity to accomplish a singular, exclusive salvation for sinners.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the indispensability of affirming both the full deity and full humanity of Christ for any adequate doctrine of salvation.
 - Prioritizes the person of Christ (ontological identity) over merely functional accounts of his role in salvation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contra pluralistic/inclusivist models: insists that salvific language in Scripture points to unique mediation, not merely exemplary or functional presence of Jesus among many saviors.
 - Contra kenotic theologies that propose the Son relinquished essential divine attributes: argues such views risk compromising Chalcedonian orthodoxy and the effective scope of atonement.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and consistently employs an **ontological vs. functional** distinction: ontology (who Christ is) secures the efficacy of his work; function alone cannot bear salvific claims.
 - Emphasizes a methodologically integrated posture: biblical-theological exegesis leading into systematic formulation, rather than a strict separateness of the two disciplines.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear defense of classical Christology and soteriological exclusivity.
 - Used in academic syllabi on contemporary Christology and polemics against pluralism and modern kenosis currents.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for restoring doctrinal precision about person and work, supplying exegetical and systematic resources for teaching Christology and defending exclusivity claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Uniqueness (of Christ)** - Affirmation that salvation is grounded in the unique person and work of Jesus, not reducible to general religious experience.
- **Hypostatic union** - Chalcedonian formula employed to account for Christ's two natures in one person; central to Wellum's argument for effective mediation.
- **Ontological vs. functional distinction** - Ontology (who Christ is) guarantees the efficacy of his function (what he accomplishes).
- **Incarnation** - The decisive event by which the divine Son assumes full human nature without loss of deity; necessary for substitutionary atonement.
- **Substitutionary atonement** - Penal/substitutionary dimensions defended as the core of Christ's salvific work.
- **Mediator / sole Mediator** - Scriptural and theological claim that Jesus uniquely mediates between God and humanity.
- **Kenosis (critique)** - Critical engagement with kenotic theories that suggest the Son emptied essential divine attributes; Wellum argues these risk undermining the Son's saving identity.
 - Contrasts kenotic functional readings (emphasis on self-limitation as role) with ontological constraints (cannot divest essential deity).
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology** - Methodological theme: Wellum argues for a productive integration where biblical-theological exegesis grounds systematic Christological claims.
- **High Christology** - Emphasis on biblical texts that ascribe divine titles and actions to Jesus; used to undergird exclusivity.
- **Chalcedonian orthodoxy** - Reference point for safeguarding the continuity of historic Christology.
- **Religious pluralism (polemic)** - Target of critique; Wellum defends exclusivist implications of NT Christology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary evangelical affirmations of the hypostatic union and exclusivity of Christ.
- As a **polemic** against religious pluralism and kenotic Christologies that relativize the Son's divine identity.
- As an **exegetical-model** for moving from biblical theology to robust systematic Christology in seminary courses.
