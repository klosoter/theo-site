### TITLE
Jesus, Paul and the Law (1990) - James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 1990; product of late-20th-century Pauline scholarship reacting to E. P. Sanders' work on Second Temple Judaism.
 - Situated within emergent **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** movement; aimed at re-evaluating traditional Protestant readings in light of Jewish context.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Dunn argues for continuity between Jesus and Paul on the law: neither repudiated Torah as divine revelation; Paul's critique targets Jewish *boundary-markers* and ethnic exclusion (the "works of law"), not the Mosaic law as moral-religious norm.
 - This reframes **justification** as primarily a corporate/covenantal question of who belongs to God's people rather than purely an individual forensic imputation of righteousness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs Jesus' relation to Torah: Jesus as faithful Jew who assumes Torah's authority while reinterpreting its expression.
 - Reads Paul within his Jewish matrix: Paul shares Jesus' reading of Torah and opposes attempts to make Gentile inclusion contingent on ethnic markers (circumcision, food laws).
 - Distinguishes types of "works": ritual/ethnic boundary-markers (target of Paul), vs. works as moral effort (not Paul's primary concern).
 - Stakes out theological implications for **justification**: faith establishes inclusion in covenant community; imputation language remains but is re-situated.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages E. P. Sanders (covenant nomism), critiques classical Lutheran/Reformed interpreters (Luther, Calvin, modern defenders of forensic imputation), and dialogues with N. T. Wright and other NPP proponents.
 - Draws on Second Temple Jewish sources, Synoptic and Pauline texts, and comparative historiography.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, covenant theology, anthropology (sin/works), Christology (Jesus' Torah-obedience and fulfillment), ecclesiology (inclusion of Gentiles), revelation indirectly insofar as Torah's authority is discussed.
- **Closing line**
 - Dunn relocates Paul's theology from an abstract soteriological legalism debate into a historically-grounded covenantal-polemical context: justification is above all about who belongs to God's renewed people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on Jesus-Paul continuity regarding Torah; law is not abolished but reconfigured in light of Christ for inclusive covenant membership.
 - Emphasizes social/constitutive function of "works of law" (boundary markers) rather than moralistic/forensic categories.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges the-Reformation-era reading that Paul primarily combats a general "works-righteousness" and that justification is chiefly a forensic declaration divorced from communal identity.
 - Revises the portrayal of Judaism as legalistic, aligning with Sanders' corrective to older polemical portraits.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and clarified the phrase **"works of law"** as socio-ethnic markers.
 - Reframed **justification** language in covenantal/relational terms while not entirely discarding forensic elements.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in stimulating widespread NPP scholarship; sparked vigorous debate in Reformed and evangelical circles.
 - Provoked sustained rebuttals defending forensic imputation (notably by scholars like Douglas Moo, Thomas Schreiner), producing a long-running methodological and theological exchange.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a historically sensitive exegetical model that forces re-evaluation of Paul within Judaism; indispensable for students exploring covenantal and corporate dimensions of justification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - Movement reinterpreting Paul in Jewish context; Dunn a principal architect.
- **Works of law** - For Dunn, primarily ethnic/ritual boundary-markers (circumcision, food laws, Sabbath) used to define membership.
 - Contrast: not equivalent to universal "works-righteousness" as moral earning of salvation.
- **Justification** - Rearticulated as covenantal admission to the people of God; forensic language retained but secondary to corporate status.
- **Forensic / Forensic imputation** - Traditional Protestant emphasis that Dunn critiques: imputation is real but must be read within corporate-covenantal logic, not as sole axis.
- **Covenant nomism** - E. P. Sanders' category adopted and advanced: Judaism as covenant-centered, not legalistic.
- **Boundary markers** - Social/ethnic practices that maintained Jewish distinctiveness; principal objects of Pauline contention.
- **Torah / Law** - Retained authority; reinterpreted in Christ for inclusion; not simply abolished.
- **Second Temple Judaism** - Historical background that reframes Pauline debates; essential for Dunn's method.
- **Inclusion of Gentiles** - Central sociotheological problem motivating Paul's doctrine of justification in Dunn's reading.
- **Union with Christ** - Underlying soteriological framework informing how believers are incorporated into covenant people.
- **Covenantal membership** - Key category for understanding Pauline language of righteousness and justification.
- **Ethnic vs. moral dimensions of "works"** - Distinction Dunn insists on for accurate exegesis.
- **Pauline polemic** - Read as intra-Jewish debate about identity, not primarily abstract soteriology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the NPP and the socio-historical meaning of "works of law".
- As a **polemic** against classic Protestant forensic-only readings of justification.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Paul within Second Temple Judaism to reframe debates over law, covenant, and inclusion.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in classroom and scholarly debates over justification, prompting reassessments of covenantal vs. forensic emphases.
