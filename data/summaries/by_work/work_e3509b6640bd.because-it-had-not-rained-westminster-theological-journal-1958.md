### TITLE
Because It Had Not Rained (Westminster Theological Journal, 1958) - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in 1958 in Westminster Theological Journal amid mid-20th-century Reformed scholarship. Kline writes from the conservative Reformed/Westminster milieu, engaging contemporary debates over Genesis interpretation, the interface of science and Scripture, and ANE background studies then growing in theological circles.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** The phrase "because it had not rained" (Genesis 2:5) must be exegetically and theologically read in its ANE agrarian narrative context; Genesis 1-2 furnishes a theological-historical account of creation and human vocation rather than a meteorological or modern scientific report. Consequently, attempts to force modern climatology or geological chronologies into the Genesis text are exegetically unwarranted.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical focus on Genesis 2:4-7, with particular attention to the Hebrew of v.5 and the narrative logic connecting divine provision and human cultivation.
 - Demonstrates that the statement is localized and functional (concerned with arability and human tilling) rather than cosmological meteorology about the whole planet.
 - Uses ANE agricultural and literary parallels to show ancient authors commonly described irrigation and vegetation in terms meaningful to their audience, not as scientific climatology.
 - Draws hermeneutical implications for the Genesis 1-11 corpus: Scripture's intent is theological-historical proclamation of origins and covenantal ordering, not the sort of natural science produced by modern disciplines.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Implicit engagement with mid-century conservative exegetes and the rising scientific-literary challenges to a straightforward reading of Genesis (concordists and some forms of harmonizing geology). Kline leans on ANE comparative data and established grammatical‑historical method rather than speculative scientific harmonization.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (how Scripture communicates origin truth), Creation (scope and intent of Genesis narrative), Providence (God's provision for Eden and humanity), Hermeneutics (genre and aims of Genesis), and Anthropology (role and vocation of Adam).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Genesis 2's meteorological wording is a narrative-theological move about divine provision and human vocation within a localized, ANE-informed frame; reading it as a scientific treatise is a category mistake that distorts Scripture's revelatory purpose.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes ANE agrarian context and narrative function over concordist commitments to modern science.
 - Frames Genesis 2 as addressing human vocation and covenantal provision rather than offering climatological data.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters both strict concordists who try to map Genesis to specific scientific phenomena and skeptical readings that reduce Genesis to myth; insists on theological-historical reality without importing modern scientific categories into the text.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines the distinction between localized narrative description and global scientific claim within biblical origin texts (a useful hermeneutical move later developed in Kline's covenantal readings).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among Reformed exegetes cautious of concordism; contributed to an approach that reads Genesis as theological history with ANE sensitivity.
 - Served later writers who argued for non‑scientific but historically real readings of Genesis (e.g., covenant‑prologue and canonical approaches).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes careful attention to genre and ancient context when handling Scripture-and-science questions.
 - Models how focused exegesis on a small narrative datum (Gen 2:5) yields broader hermeneutical implications for Genesis 1-11 and the "days" debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Because it had not rained" (Gen 2:5):** Central phrase; Kline reads it as a narrative claim about local cultivation conditions rather than global climatology.
- **Localized narration:** The idea that Genesis 2 reports garden‑level conditions, not universal meteorology.
- **ANE agrarian context:** Use of ancient Near Eastern farming and irrigation patterns to interpret biblical wording and concerns.
- **Non‑concordism:** A hermeneutic avoiding forced alignment of biblical statements with modern scientific categories.
- **Grammatical‑historical method:** Kline's exegetical posture-attend to language, context, and ancient world to recover authorial intent.
- **Theological‑historical account:** Reading Genesis as historically oriented theology (true history shaped to theological ends) rather than modern natural science.
- **Human vocation / cultivation motif:** The narrative link between God's provision and Adam's role as tiller/keeper of the garden.
- **Covenantal implications:** Eden as granted, provisioned land with obligations-anticipates covenantal structures in Kline's later work.
- **Genesis 1-2 relationship:** Treats 2 as a localized expansion of 1, emphasizing function and purpose over scientific sequencing.
- **Scripture‑science boundary:** The methodological line Kline defends-Scripture speaks truthfully but in categories different from modern empirical science.
- **Hermeneutical caution:** Principle to avoid category mistakes when applying modern scientific questions to ancient texts.
- **Exegesis over speculation:** Priority of close textual analysis over speculative harmonizing with scientific data.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for scholarly caution about reading Genesis as modern scientific prose.
- As a **polemic** against concordist readings that force scientific chronologies or climatologies into the text.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating use of ANE context and narrative function to interpret problematic phrases.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed discussions of Days of Creation-supports reading Genesis 1-2 as theological‑historical material rather than a scientific account to be reconciled with geology or meteorology.
