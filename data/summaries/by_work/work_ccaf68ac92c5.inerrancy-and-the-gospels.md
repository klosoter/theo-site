### TITLE
Inerrancy and the Gospels - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical-Reformed milieu; responds to post-war debates over biblical authority, the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978), and renewed historical-critical challenges to the Gospels.
 - Poythress writes as a conservative Reformed theologian and analytic philosopher of religion, aiming to supply hermeneutical principles that preserve both divine inspiration and the historical particularity of Gospel witnesses.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The canonical Gospels are fully inspired and therefore inerrant in what they affirm; apparent discrepancies are to be resolved by careful attention to authorial intention, genre, perspective, and theological coherence rather than by conceding error.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys alleged contradictions and historiographical objections raised by higher criticism and selective skeptical readings.
 - Hermeneutical proposal:
 - Distinguish authorial intention from modern historiographical expectations; treat the evangelists as legitimate ancient historiographers with theological aims.
 - Appeal to literary, historical, and theological criteria (context, perspective, complementary testimony) to harmonize accounts where appropriate.
 - Theological integration:
 - Affirm classical doctrines of inspiration and accommodation: divine authorship works through distinct human authors without producing contradiction.
 - Show how Christological and soteriological claims (including accounts of Christ's obedience and passion) depend on the reliable historicity of Gospel narratives.
 - Practical consequence: a presuppositional commitment to inerrancy yields parsimonious and coherent exegesis; liberal concessions fracture doctrines that hinge on Gospel testimony.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Evangelical defenders of inerrancy (e.g., appeals to the Chicago Statement, Warfieldian tradition) and critics from historical-critical scholarship (anonymous "higher criticism," contemporary skeptics).
 - Uses broader theological resources: patristic and Reformational sensitivities (e.g., Law/Gospel distinctions in the Lutheran-Reformed conversation) and Reformed treatments of Christ's obedience (active/passive categories).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy; Gospel Christology (including the historical basis for doctrines of Christ's active and passive obedience); hermeneutics; soteriology insofar as Gospel testimony grounds atonement claims.
 - Implicitly touches covenantal theology by preserving the reliability of the Messianic-historical narrative.

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress locates the center of gravity in a conservative epistemology of Scripture: the Gospel writers are trustworthy witnesses whose inspired testimony must be read with literary sensitivity and theological coherence to safeguard Christian doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - A disciplined blend of analytic philosophy and classic Reformed dogmatics applied to textual-historical questions; stresses *complementary testimony* rather than forced harmonization.
 - Prioritizes authorial intention and the role of divine accommodation in biblical testimony.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against both naive harmonizers who ignore genre and methodological critics who demand modern historiographical standards; corrects extremes on both sides.
 - Contrasts with liberal concessions that treat Gospel differences as errors; contrasts with reductionistic apologetics that collapse theological content into mere historical minutiae.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on "perspectival noncontradiction": differences in perspective or scope do not amount to factual contradiction when properly analyzed.
 - Integrates philosophical underpinnings (theory of truth, testimony) with canonical-hermeneutical practice.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a careful defense of inerrancy that is not anti-intellectual; used in seminary discussions on hermeneutics and apologetics.
 - Less persuasive to critical-historical scholars but stimulates cross-disciplinary engagement between philosophy of religion and biblical studies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a teachable framework for reading the Gospels that preserves doctrinal commitments while engaging historical questions; excellent pedagogical resource for advanced students wrestling with inerrancy issues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture, properly interpreted, is without error in all that it affirms; a central presupposition for Poythress's method.

- **Inspiration**
 - Divine authorship that operates through human authors - explains unity and truth without erasing human distinctives.

- **Authorial intention**
 - Primary hermeneutical criterion; discerning what an evangelist intended prevents category mistakes in attributing errors.

- **Perspective / Complementary testimony**
 - Differences in vantage or emphasis among the evangelists that explain apparent divergences without implying contradiction.

- **Genre and ancient historiography**
 - Recognizes Gospel genre features and ancient standards of historical reporting; resists imposition of modern standards.

- **Accommodation**
 - Divine accommodation: God communicates truth in ways suited to human authorship and audience; accounts for theological shape without error.

- **Law-Gospel distinction**
 - Used as a hermeneutical safeguard: prevents reading legalistic categories back into Gospel narratives or conflating moral-imperative texts with narrative witness (connects to Lutheran/Reformed methodological insights).

- **Active and Passive Obedience**
 - Treats Gospel narratives as reliable witnesses to both Christ's life-fulfillment of the law (active obedience) and suffering/death (passive obedience); inerrancy undergirds doctrinal claims about Christ's meritorious obedience.

- **Harmonization vs. Noncontradiction**
 - Poythress prefers principled harmonization guided by noncontradiction and perspectival analysis rather than forced reconciliation.

- **Testimony and Historical Credibility**
 - Philosophical account of testimonial knowledge applied to apostolic witnesses; credibility is assessed by coherence, corroboration, and authorial intent.

- **Hermeneutical modesty**
 - Method that combines conviction in inerrancy with careful textual and historical sensitivity.

- **Christology (Gospel witness)**
 - Theological claims about Jesus depend on the truthful reporting of events; inerrancy thus has direct doctrinal stakes.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for conservative articulations of inerrancy that incorporate literary and philosophical tools.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist critical readings of Gospel differences and against simplistic harmonizers.
 - As an **exegetical model** in seminaries for reading Gospel narratives with theological integrity and historical responsibility.
