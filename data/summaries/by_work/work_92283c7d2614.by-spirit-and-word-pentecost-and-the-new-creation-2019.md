### TITLE
By Spirit and Word: Pentecost and the New Creation (2019) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2019 from within the conservative Reformed academy (Westminster tradition). Engages contemporary charismatic/continuationist debates while rooted in Reformation and post‑War Princeton hermeneutics (Vos, Warfield, Calvin).
 - Milieu: renewed interest in Pentecost/new‑creation language in evangelical pneumatology, and intensified debate over the continuation of sign gifts.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Pentecost inaugurates the eschatological new creation by the Spirit, and the proper theological account locates the Spirit's normative activity in conjunction with the Word. This framing resolves tensions between charismatic exuberance and Word‑centered Reformed sobriety.
 - Doctrinal problem addressed: how to understand the continuation (or cessation) of charismatic gifts in light of Pentecost, apostolic witness, and the canon.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Acts 2, key Pauline pneumatology (esp. 1-2 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians), and Johannine Spirit motifs to show Pentecost as eschatological inauguration.
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a principled unity of Spirit and Word - the Spirit authenticates, applies, and creates faith but does so primarily through the Word and the ordained means of grace.
 - Historical/theological claim: the apostolic era manifested certain extraordinary sign gifts tied to authentication of apostolic witness; these are historically conditioned and not normative for ongoing canonical revelation or church order.
 - Pastoral/ecclesial implications: robust expectation of Spirit's present work (regeneration, sanctification, mission) while denying that contemporary claims to revelatory parity with apostolic sign gifts should determine doctrine or canon.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Geerhardus Vos, B. B. Warfield, John Calvin, and broader Reformed patristic and Protestant sources.
 - Interacts with contemporary continuationist and charismatic proponents (implicit/explicit polemic), and with cessationist formulations in Reformed circles.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, revelation (Word vs. Spirit), eschatology and new creation, Christology (resurrection as pneumatological), ecclesiology (means of grace), apostolicity, miracles/signs.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The book centers on a Reformed conviction that the Spirit brings the new creation principally through the Word and that Pentecost both inaugurates the eschatological age and limits the epistemic role of extraordinary apostolic signs once the apostolic witness is established.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the inseparability yet functional distinction of Spirit and Word: Spirit is sovereignly active, but its normative epistemic and salvific activity is mediate through the proclaimed and written Word.
 - Framing Pentecost primarily in new‑creation/eschatological terms rather than merely as an empowerment event.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects charismatic narratives that elevate contemporary extraordinary manifestations to normative revelatory status.
 - Refines older cessationist caricatures by affirming robust ongoing Spirit activity (regeneration, sanctification, mission) without conceding contemporary charismatic claims to apostolic authority.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Tight pairing "By Spirit and Word" as an operative theological formula to describe how the Spirit effects the new creation without relativizing the finality of canonical revelation.
 - Emphasizes the resurrection as constitutive for Pentecost - linking christological vindication and pneumatological outpouring.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a significant Reformed corrective to both charismatic excess and arid scholasticism; used in Reformed seminaries and by conservative evangelicals as a measured pneumatology.
 - Influential in shaping subsequent Reformed engagements with continuationism, offering exegetical resources rather than mere assertions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Balances pastoral sensitivity to Spirit‑work with theological rigor about canon and apostolicity; valuable for preaching, confessional instruction, and academic courses on pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pentecost (inauguration of new creation)** - event that marks the eschatological beginning of the new age.
- **Spirit and Word (unity and distinction)** - slogan describing normative operation of Spirit through Scripture and preached Word.
- **New creation** - eschatological reality instituted by Christ's resurrection and the Spirit's outpouring.
- **Apostolic sign gifts** - miracles, tongues, prophetic attestations linked to apostolic authentication; argued to be historically conditioned.
 - Relation: authenticating role diminished once apostolic witness and canon established.
- **Normative revelation / canonical closure** - the claim that the canon constitutes the controlled locus of normative public revelation.
- **Regeneration vs. revelatory charisma** - Gaffin distinguishes Spirit's internal saving work from extraordinary revelatory gifts.
- **Eschatological inauguration** - concept emphasizing "already/not yet" presence of the new creation.
- **Objective Spirit** - emphasis on Spirit's public, historical acts (resurrection, Pentecost) apart from purely subjective experience.
- **Means of grace** - preaching, sacraments as primary mediations of Spirit's saving work.
- **Authentication** - apostolic signs served to authenticate the apostolic message; their normative justificatory role ends with the apostolic era.
- **Continuationism** (debate term) - the view that sign gifts continue; Gaffin's treatment is critical of unregulated continuationist claims.
- **Cessationism** (debate term) - the view that sign gifts have ceased; Gaffin offers a nuanced, moderate form that allows robust Spirit activity without ongoing apostolic‑level signs.
- **Pneumatological christology** - linking Spirit's work to the resurrection and vindication of Christ.
- **Canonical and ecclesial order** - concern with how gifts fit within church governance and doctrine.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for a Reformed pneumatology that integrates eschatology and canonical theology.
 - As a **polemic** against continuationist claims to contemporary apostolic‑level revelations.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pentecost and Pauline pneumatology in light of new‑creation theology.
