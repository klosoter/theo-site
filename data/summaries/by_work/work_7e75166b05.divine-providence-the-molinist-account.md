### TITLE
**Divine Providence: The Molinist Account - Thomas P. Flint**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century analytic-theology engagement with classical scholastic insights.
 - Part of a broader revival of Molinism in Anglo-American philosophy of religion and evangelical theology, responding to Thomist/Calvinist and Open Theist accounts.
 - Method: systematic-philosophical theology, careful engagement with metaphysics of knowledge, causation, and freedom.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Flint defends a fully developed **Molinist account** of divine providence: God, by means of **middle knowledge (scientia media)**, knows counterfactuals of creaturely freedom and thereby **sovereignly actualizes** a world in which free decisions realize divine ends without violating libertarian freedom.
 - The core problem addressed: how to reconcile **divine sovereignty and providential control** with **human libertarian freedom** and **robust divine foreknowledge**.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Explication of the threefold ordering of divine knowledge:
 - **Natural knowledge**: truths about necessary realities and divine capabilities.
 - **Middle knowledge**: knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstances (counterfactuals of freedom).
 - **Free knowledge**: knowledge of the actual world once God decrees to create/actualize it.
 - Account of providential governance:
 - God surveys feasible worlds via middle knowledge and, by creative decree, selects the world whose pattern of free choices best serves his purposes.
 - This allows genuine human freedom while preserving God's antecedent sovereignty and foreknowledge.
 - Responses to major objections:
 - **Grounding objection**: Are counterfactuals of freedom truth-apt absent a truth-maker? Flint canvasses grounding strategies and defends the intelligibility and truth of these counterfactuals as known by God.
 - **Divine simplicity / immutability**: reconciliation of middle knowledge with classical divine attributes (timelessness, simplicity) through logical rather than temporal ordering of decrees and knowledge.
 - Engagement with Thomist, Calvinist, and Open Theist critiques, showing how Molinism avoids determinism and the open future while keeping divine sovereignty intact.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical and late-scholastic sources: **Luis de Molina**, Suarez, scholastic background.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: **Thomists** and Reformed determinists (e.g., classical compatibilists), **Open Theists**, and analytic Molinists (e.g., William Lane Craig, Alvin Plantinga on related topics).
 - Modern philosophers of religion addressing counterfactuals and grounding objections.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine providence**, foreknowledge, predestination, election.
 - **Human freedom** (libertarian), responsibility, moral agency.
 - Divine attributes implicated: omniscience, omnipotence, timelessness/eternity, immutability.
 - Adjacent topics: prayer, miracles, concursus (divine concurrence), prevenient grace.

- **Closing line**
 - Flint's Molinist account centers on the claim that **God's middle knowledge allows him to sovereignly actualize a world of free creatures such that providential ends are achieved without coercing human freedom**, thereby offering a robust third way between divine determinism and radical openness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous, systematic deployment of **middle knowledge** as the linchpin of a coherent providence theology.
 - Careful logical ordering of divine knowledge and decrees to preserve classical attributes while accommodating middle knowledge.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with **Thomistic/Calvinist** views that typically tie divine foreknowledge to efficacious predestination (thus endorsing compatibilist constraints).
 - Opposes **Open Theism** by maintaining exhaustive divine foreknowledge while protecting libertarian freedom.
 - Clarifies Molina's original insights with contemporary metaphysical tools to answer modern objections (esp. grounding objection).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematizes the threefold knowledge scheme in contemporary analytic idiom and refines the role of **counterfactuals of freedom** as theological primitives.
 - Emphasizes **selection-from-counterfactual-knowledge** as the operative means of providential control rather than deterministic causation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in analytic discussions of providence, freedom, and foreknowledge; influential in evangelical and philosophical circles that favor Molinism.
 - Provoked sustained critique from Thomists/Reformed theologians concerning grounding and metaphysical implications for divine simplicity.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models how to integrate scholastic insights with analytic philosophy.
 - Serves as a concise, contemporary articulation of Molinist providence, useful for courses on providence, divine foreknowledge, and philosophy of religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (middle knowledge)**: God's knowledge of true counterfactuals about what free creatures would do in hypothetical circumstances.
- **Counterfactuals of freedom**: Propositions of the form "If person S were in circumstance C, S would freely do A"; central to Molinist providence.
 - Contrast: differs from simple conditional predictions grounded in deterministic laws.
- **Natural knowledge (scientia naturalis)**: Knowledge of necessary truths and divine powers.
- **Free knowledge (scientia libera / scientia Christi)**: Knowledge of the actual world God chooses to create (post-decretal).
- **Actualization / divine decree**: God's creative act selecting which feasible world to make actual, thus determining the content of free decisions without coercion.
- **Grounding objection**: Challenge that counterfactuals of freedom lack truth-makers independent of God's knowledge.
- **Libertarian free will**: The view that free choices are not causally determined and are genuine sources of action.
- **Divine sovereignty**: God's ultimate control over history; in Molinism exercised via actualizing choices among counterfactuals.
- **Foreknowledge vs predestination**: Distinction between God's knowledge of future free acts and the decree by which God brings about ends through chosen world-actualization.
- **Concursus (divine concurrence)**: How divine causality coheres with creaturely causation in Molinist accounts.
- **Timelessness / logical ordering of decrees**: Strategy to reconcile middle knowledge with classical divine immutability.
- **Molinism**: The overall theological system combining middle knowledge, libertarian freedom, and divine providence.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Molinist formulations of providence and middle knowledge.
 - As a **polemic resource** against determinist (Reformed/Thomist) and Open Theist positions-provides structured rejoinders.
 - As a **conceptual model** in exegetical and pastoral discussions of prayer, election, and theodicy where divine foreknowledge and human freedom intersect.
