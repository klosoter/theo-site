### TITLE
Classical Theism, Reformed Orthodoxy, and the Attributes of God - Robert Letham (Westminster Theological Journal, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2010s Reformed theological conversation; response to renewed interest in classical theism among analytic philosophers and some systematic theologians.
 - Situated within Reformed orthodoxy and pastoral scholarship seeking to protect biblical personalism against a divinity reduced to metaphysical ground-of-being.

- **Central thesis**
 - Letham argues that classical theism and Reformed orthodoxy need not be opposed if one properly distinguishes **absolute** (metaphysical) and **relative** (relational) attributes of God; the theological task is to preserve divine simplicity and transcendence while safeguarding biblical affirmation of God's personal, covenantal engagement.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Identification of the contemporary resurgence of classical theism and the theological anxieties it raises for Reformed readers (risk of depersonalizing God).
 - Clarification of the categories: what counts as an **absolute attribute** (e.g., simplicity, immutability, eternity) versus a **relative attribute** (e.g., knowledge, will, love toward creatures).
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic, medieval, and Reformed orthodox treatments of attributes, showing continuity and points of divergence.
 - Theological synthesis: proposal that absolute attributes describe God's being in itself, while relative attributes express God's personal relations and acts toward creation - both legitimately predicated of the one God without contradiction.
 - Pastoral and doctrinal implications: preserves theism that is both metaphysically coherent and biblically faithful.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical sources (Augustine, Aquinas), Reformed orthodox writers (Calvin, Turretin, Puritan authors), and contemporary interlocutors promoting classical theism or critiquing it.
 - Interfaces with modern analytic philosophical theology though Letham remains primarily ecclesial-historical in method.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Attributes of God (central)
 - Trinity (implications for how attributes are predicated of the three persons and the divine essence)
 - Providence and creation (relation of God's immutable will to temporal acts)
 - Revelation (how Scripture discloses relational attributes)

- **Closing line**
 - Letham's central gravity: classical metaphysical categories can and should be kept in covenantal, scriptural perspective so that divine transcendence and personal engagement are held together without reducing one to the other.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp insistence on a twofold framework (absolute vs relative attributes) as the corrective that enables coexistence of classical metaphysics and Reformed biblical personalism.
 - Prioritizes ecclesial and scriptural norms over abstract metaphysical extrapolations.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters forms of classical theism that efface God's personal, covenantal action (e.g., excessive focus on God as pure act/ground-of-being detached from temporal relations).
 - Distinguishes his reading from Thomistic-only models by drawing on Reformed orthodox categories and pastoral concerns.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Rehabilitates the "absolute/relative" terminology within Reformed discourse as a hermeneutical tool for theological method and attribute-talk.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful touchstone in Reformed circles for debates on immutability, impassibility, and divine simplicity.
 - Cited in discussions seeking to integrate philosophical theology with confessional, pastoral commitments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise corrective and pedagogical summary for seminarians and scholars navigating tensions between metaphysical theology and biblical Theism.
 - Continues to be referenced where one needs a measured, tradition-savvy reconciliation of two streams.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical Theism**
 - The philosophical-theological posture asserting God's simplicity, immutability, eternity, aseity; often grounded in Augustinian/Thomistic metaphysics.

- **Reformed Orthodoxy**
 - Confessional stream emphasizing Scriptural revelation, covenant, and God's personal dealings; cautious about speculative metaphysics.

- **Absolute Attributes**
 - Attributes that disclose God's being in himself (e.g., simplicity, immutability, eternity).
 - Function: metaphysical descriptors that safeguard transcendence and unity.

- **Relative Attributes**
 - Attributes that describe God's relations and actions toward creatures (e.g., knowledge of creatures, love, will).
 - Function: preserve personal, covenantal engagement.

- **Divine Simplicity**
 - Claim that God is not composed of parts; Letham defends simplicity while insisting it must not efface personal relations.

- **Immutability**
 - God's unchangeableness; treated as compatible with genuine relational action when properly understood as identity of will rather than static passivity.

- **Impassibility**
 - Doctrine that God does not suffer; Letham navigates tensions between impassibility and biblical language of divine pathos without collapsing either.

- **Eternity**
 - God's relation to time; absolute attribute emphasizing God's timelessness while allowing for genuine temporal relations with creation.

- **Incommunicable vs Communicable Attributes**
 - Incommunicable = attributes primarily of the divine essence (e.g., aseity); communicable = attributes shareable analogically with creatures (e.g., holiness, love).

- **Relationality / Personalism**
 - Emphasis on God as personal, triune, covenanting; used to check over-metaphysical reduction.

- **Trinitarian Attribution**
 - How attributes are predicated of the one essence and the three persons; Letham underscores doctrinal caution here.

- **Providence & Revelation**
 - Practical loci where absolute/relative distinction bears pastoral weight (how immutable will governs temporal events and how Scripture discloses God's relational acts).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definitional and methodological resource for discussing **Absolute And Relative Attributes** in lecture and essays.
- As a polemical resource against reductions of God to impersonal metaphysics and as a conciliatory model for integrating classical metaphysics with Reformed theology.
- As a conceptual pivot in exegetical discussions about divine action where metaphysical language must be harmonized with biblical personalism.
