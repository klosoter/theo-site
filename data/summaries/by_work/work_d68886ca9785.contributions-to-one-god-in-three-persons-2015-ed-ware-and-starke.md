### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., contribution to One God in Three Persons (2015, ed. Ware & Starke)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid a renewed evangelical debate over **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** (circa 2010s). Volume brings diverse evangelical voices on Trinitarian doctrine; Gaffin contributes from a distinctly Reformed, biblically exegetical perspective.
 - The milieu: conservative Reformed scholarship reacting to proposals that articulate an eternal authority-submission ordering within the Godhead as the ground for human gender roles and ecclesial authority structures.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Gaffin argues that contemporary claims for **Eternal Functional Subordination** improperly conflate economic roles in redemption-history with eternal intra-Trinitarian relations; such conflation threatens classical Trinitarian orthodoxy by introducing an ontological inequality into the Godhead.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory move: situates the discussion within classical distinctions between **immanent (ontological) Trinity** and **economic Trinity**; insists on careful exegetical grounding.
 - Exegetical core:
 - Re-reads key New Testament passages (notably Pauline texts used in the EFS debate) with attention to literary context, Pauline anthropologies, and redemptive-historical function of language about "head", "submission", and "authority".
 - Shows that texts pointing to submission/authority primarily describe the incarnational, salvific economy, not eternal intra-divine relations.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Reaffirms traditional Reformed formulations: **ontological equality** of Father, Son, and Spirit; eternal relations defined by **origin (begetting/procession)**, not by authority/submission.
 - Warns against theological and pastoral consequences of reading subordination into the divine essence.
 - Concluding move: recommends preserving classical creedal categories and using Scripture to discern role-language as bounded by the economy of redemption.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary proponents of EFS (broadly represented in the volume and debate) and dialogues with historical creeds, patristic witnesses, and Reformed confessional theology.
 - Uses Pauline corpus and Johannine language as primary biblical sources; draws on Reformed systematic tradition for doctrinal constraints.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (center), with implications for **Christology** (eternal Sonship vs functional subordination), **revelation** (how God self-discloses in economy), and ecclesial/ethical applications (authority and submission).

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's piece functions as a careful exegetical-theological corrective: preserve ontological equality of the Trinity by locating "submission" squarely within the economic, incarnational work of the Son rather than as an eternal mode of divine being.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the **immanent/economic distinction** as a hermeneutical safeguard; exegetical rigor over analogical or socio-political readings of "head" and "authority".
 - Prioritizes confessional and creedal benchmarks (Reformed lens) in adjudicating contemporary proposals.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects proponents who treat the Son's incarnational obedience as evidencing an eternal authority-submission relation.
 - Contrasts with theological strategies that make intradivine ordering the ontological basis for human social structures.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Less innovative in neologisms; rather, reasserts traditional terminology (**relations of origin**, **immanent/economic Trinity**) with renewed exegetical application against EFS.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Cited among Reformed scholars and conservative evangelicals as a reliable polemical and exegetical resource against EFS.
 - Used in academic and pastoral contexts to caution against theological moves that compromise divine simplicity and equality.

- **Enduring value**
 - A concise model for integrating rigorous biblical exegesis with confessional dogmatics; valuable for teaching Trinity doctrine and for critical engagement in EFS-era debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - The view that the Son is eternally subordinate to the Father in authority/role; Gaffin rejects this as illegitimate for the immanent Trinity.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God is in himself (ontology); Gaffin insists this realm preserves equality and unity.
- **Economic Trinity** - God as he acts in history (economy of salvation); the proper locus for role-language like "submission".
- **Ontological equality** - The co-equal, co-essential status of Father, Son, Spirit; non-negotiable for Gaffin.
- **Relations of origin** - **eternal begetting** (Son) and **procession** (Spirit); the classical categories for intra-Trinitarian distinction without subordination.
- **Submission / Authority (in Scripture)** - Descriptive of incarnational and salvific relations; should not be read back into the eternal inner life of God.
- **"Head" (kephale) vocabulary** - A contested Pauline term; Gaffin treats contextual and functional uses as economic, not proof of eternal hierarchy.
- **Incarnation / obedience of the Son** - Central to the economy; explains submission language as temporal and soteriological.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling** - Implied by Gaffin's affirmation of coequality and unity.
- **Subordinationism (Arianism)** - Historical error; Gaffin uses it as a cautionary pole to show risks of ontological subordination.
- **Creedal/confessional restraint** - Methodological commitment to classical formulations as theological boundary markers.
- **Biblical exegesis (Pauline focus)** - Primary method for adjudicating claims about divine relations.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - Frames role-language within God's saving acts rather than eternal ontology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against EFS in ecclesial and academic debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline "head" and submission texts within the economy.
 - As a **doctrinal definition source** in Reformed teaching to uphold ontological equality while accounting for economic roles.
