### TITLE
Of National Churches - Richard Baxter

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑17th century England (Restoration era concerns); Baxter writes amid the collapse of a single established church, the rise of Presbyterian and Independent parties, and the 1662 Act of Uniformity that produced large-scale ejections.
 - Part of Baxter's broader pastoral and irenic project to secure unity without sacrificing conscience; addresses polity and the relationships between church, state, and dissenters.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can the Christian church be both visibly national (organized within political societies) and truly apostolic/catholic while avoiding sectarian division and coercive uniformity?
 - Baxter argues for a reformed national church that secures unity in essentials, toleration in nonessentials, and pastoral discipline without arbitrary exclusion.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary fragmentation stems from over‑rigid views of church membership and polity on all sides.
 - Proposal: A comprehended national church built on biblical and apostolic marks, administered with moderate episcopacy/parish ministry, and capable of embracing godly dissenters under limited latitude.
 - Maintain public worship, sacraments, catechesis, and pastoral oversight as national means of grace.
 - Limit coercion to clear moral and doctrinal essentials; allow liberty in secondary rites and ceremonies.
 - Use civil magistracy to preserve public order and encourage true religion, not to enforce private conscience.
 - Practical prescriptions: qualifications for ministers, parish organization, corrective discipline applied as medicinal rather than punitive.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural argumentation (NT ecclesiology) and constant appeal to the early church (primitive episcopacy and catholicity).
 - Polemical engagement with Presbyterians, Independents (Congregationalists), and high‑church Anglicans; theological debt to Reformation standards while seeking moderation.
 - Draws on pastoral literature and Baxter's own pastoral experience.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (visible vs. invisible church; marks of a true church)
 - Ministry and church government (episcopacy, presbyterate, parish)
 - Sacraments as means and seals of grace within a national framework
 - Civil magistrate and church relations
 - Church discipline and pastoral care

- **Closing line**
 - Baxter's practical ecclesiology centers on a reformed, apostolicly‑inspired national church that upholds essentials for catholic unity while allowing measured latitude to prevent needless schism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Advocacy of a *comprehensive national church* as a mediating polity between strict Presbyterian uniformity and Congregational independence.
 - Pastoral pragmatism: church order must primarily serve the salvation and holiness of people, not abstract constitutional schemes.
 - Strongly therapeutic view of discipline: corrective, pastoral, aimed at restoration rather than exclusion for minor differences.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Against Presbyterian rigidity: resists an over‑institutionalized subscription to presbyterial forms as the sole scriptural model.
 - Against Independency: rejects the atomization of congregations with no connexional oversight or national coherence.
 - Against high‑church coercion: opposes using the state to impose ceremonies or conscience beyond essentials.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Modern presentation of "comprehension" within a reformed framework-anticipates later latitudinarian and ecumenical approaches.
 - Tension‑bearing articulation of the church as both visible/national and yet bound to apostolic catholicity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among moderate Anglicans and latitudinarians; provided an intellectual resource for attempts at Church of England comprehension after the Restoration.
 - Read as a major Puritan attempt at irenicism; later critics (both strict nonconformists and high‑church Anglicans) found it too accommodating.
 - Continues to be cited in studies of English ecclesiology and church polity debates.

- **Enduring value**
 - A richly pragmatic ecclesiology for teaching about the interplay of theology, polity, and pastoral care.
 - A resource for ecumenical conversation about essentials, toleration, and the role of the state in religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **National Church**
 - A church organized at the level of a political society; Baxter argues for a reformed national institution that embraces parish structures and public worship.
- **Comprehension**
 - Inclusion of godly persons with differing nonessential practices into one public church; a policy of unity without enforced uniformity.
- **Visible Church**
 - The organized, public society of worshippers and ministers; Baxter treats it as mixed but governed by marks and ordinances.
- **Invisible Church**
 - The spiritual body known perfectly only to God; Baxter balances visibility with this inward reality.
- **Primitive (Apostolic) Episcopacy**
 - Baxter's appeal to an early, limited episcopacy-pastoral oversight without hierarchical absolutism.
- **Marks of the Church**
 - Preaching of the Word, administration of sacraments, and discipleship/discipline-criteria for corporate ecclesial identity.
- **Sacraments as Means and Seals**
 - Instruments of grace within the public church; not dependent on episcopal ceremonialism to be valid.
- **Church Discipline (Therapeutic)**
 - Discipline aimed at repentance and restoration; limited grounds for exclusion.
- **Civil Magistrate**
 - A role to maintain order and encourage religion, but not to coerce conscience on nonessentials.
- **Mixed Multitude**
 - Language for the visible church's composition of both regenerate and unregenerate members; justifies pastoral caution in excluding persons.
- **Uniformity vs. Liberty**
 - Baxter argues for essential uniformity (doctrine, sacraments) and liberty in rites and ceremonies.
- **Pastoral Care**
 - Central to Baxter's ecclesiology; ministerial duties include catechesis, visitation, and correction.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a moderating Reformed ecclesiology that locates catholic unity in essentials plus national forms.
 - As a **polemic** against both sectarian fragmentation and coercive conformity-useful in studies of toleration.
 - As an **exemplary pastoral model** for ministry, discipline, and the parish system in historical theology and practical theology.
