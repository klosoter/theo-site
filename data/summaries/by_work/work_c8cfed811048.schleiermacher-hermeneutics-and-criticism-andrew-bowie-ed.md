### TITLE
**Schleiermacher: Hermeneutics and Criticism (Andrew Bowie, ed.) - Friedrich Schleiermacher**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 18th-early 19th century German Romanticism and the aftermath of Enlightenment criticism; Schleiermacher writes from within post-Kantian philosophical theology, reacting to Pietism, rationalist apologetics, and emerging historical-critical scholarship. (Bowie, ed., Hermeneutics and Criticism)
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** how to ground theological knowledge and textual interpretation so theology can be a disciplined Wissenschaft while remaining true to the living core of religious experience.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Theory of interpretation centered on reconstructing the author's inner world via grammatical and psychological interpretation; hermeneutics as a methodological art enabling empathetic understanding (Einfuhlung).
 - Theology must proceed historically and critically: texts and traditions are objects for sympathetic reconstruction, not merely dogmatic proof-sources.
 - Religious knowledge rests not on metaphysical proofs but on the immediate consciousness of dependence (the "feeling of absolute dependence"); theology translates that religious self-consciousness into systematic account.
- **Major moves (sub-bullets):**
 - Distinguish grammatical (textual, linguistic) from psychological (authorial intent, inner life) exegesis.
 - Employ historical criticism to situate doctrine yet maintain systematic coherence via reflective reconstruction.
 - Reinterpret traditional doctrines (e.g., original sin, Adam) in anthropological and existential terms rather than as metaphysical propositions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Kant and post-Kantian idealists (Fichte), Enlightenment critics, Pietist and confessional theology; later reception by Dilthey, Gadamer, and modern liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation (recast as inward religious consciousness), sin and freedom (anthropological framing), authority of Scripture (historical-critical reading), the task of theology as Wissenschaft, and implications for doctrines like Adam and covenant.
- **Closing line:** Schleiermacher reorients theology from metaphysical proof to disciplined hermeneutic reconstruction of religious self-consciousness, making theology a historically informed science grounded in the feeling of dependence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Priority of religio-experiential foundation (feeling of absolute dependence) over speculative proofs for God.
 - Hermeneutics as an art of empathetic reconstruction rather than mere philological technique.
 - Theology as both historical criticism and systematic reflection-bridge between history and dogma.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Enlightenment deism and rationalist apologetics by restoring the inner religious fact as epistemic ground.
 - Diverges from orthodox confessionalism by reframing doctrines (e.g., original sin, Adam) in psychological/anthropological terms rather than juridical-federal categories.
 - Modifies Kantian limits to metaphysics by granting positive content to religious self-consciousness without reverting to dogmatic metaphysics.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Einfuhlung (empathic understanding) as hermeneutical tool.
 - Recasting theology as Wissenschaft that is at once historical, critical, and systematic.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Major formative influence on modern hermeneutics (Dilthey, Gadamer), liberal Protestant theology, and historicist approaches to Scripture.
 - Contested in Reformed circles for undermining traditional formulations like federal headship of Adam and forensic views of sin.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models integration of rigorous historical criticism with constructive theology.
 - Provides methodological vocabulary (understanding vs. explanation; hermeneutic circle) indispensable for contemporary theological method courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hermeneutics (Hermeneutik):** art/science of interpretation emphasizing authorial reconstruction; twofold method-grammatical and psychological.
- **Einfuhlung (empathic understanding):** imaginative entry into the author's mind; central hermeneutical procedure.
- **Grammatical vs. Psychological interpretation:** text/linguistic analysis versus reconstruction of authorial intention and feeling.
- **Hermeneutic circle:** mutual dependence of part/whole and interpreter/author in understanding.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence (Gefuhl der schlecthinnigen Abhangigkeit):** foundational religious datum; basis for theological epistemology.
- **Theology as Wissenschaft:** theology conceived as disciplined, systematic science grounded in historical-critical method.
- **Revelation (recast):** not primarily propositional deposit but disclosure in religious consciousness mediated by Scripture and tradition.
- **Original sin (anthropological reading):** human condition of finitude and estrangement rather than strictly federal-juridical guilt.
 - Relation to Adam: Adam functions as existential exemplar and historical locus, not simply as metaphysical headship in many Schleiermacher readings.
- **Freedom and sin:** freedom understood in relational/reflective terms; sin as disruption of religious self-consciousness.
- **Historicity:** insistence on placing doctrines and texts in historical context as prerequisite for theological articulation.
- **Method (Principia of theological science):** combine careful exegesis, historical placement, and systematic reconstruction.
- **Authority of Scripture:** mediated authority; historical-critical competence needed to discern theological cores.
- **Empirical/psychological sources:** use of literary, historical, and psychological evidence in theological formation.
- **Critical sympathy:** normative posture-critical but participatory reading of texts and traditions.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **methodological definition source** for courses on hermeneutics and theological method (understanding vs. explanation; Einfuhlung).
 - As a **polemic resource** against dogmatic proofs and for reinterpreting doctrines like Adam/original sin in anthropological terms.
 - As an **exegetical model** for combining grammatical and psychological exegesis in biblical studies.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of theology as Wissenschaft-bridging historical criticism and systematic theology.
