### TITLE
Theological Interpretation of the New Testament - D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical scholarship reacting to the dominance of historical-critical exegesis and to emerging "theological interpretation" movements (canonical criticism, narrative and postliberal readings). Carson writes from an evangelical, Reformed-leaning milieu committed to critical scholarship and confessional fidelity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament must be read as theology - i.e., as Scripture that articulates and forms Christian belief and life - without abandoning rigorous historical-critical exegesis. The task is to allow the NT's theological claims to drive interpretation while remaining historically responsible and doctrinally self-aware.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Diagnose the weaknesses of extremes: purely historical reconstruction that evacuates theological meaning, and theological readings that impose systematic categories onto the text.
 - Defend a middle path: **theological interpretation that is historically informed, textually precise (grammar/structure), canonically sensitive, and ecclesially oriented.**
 - Offer methodological principles for reading NT books theologically: attend to authorial intention and rhetorical situation; trace theological argument and christological centers; relate exegetical findings to systematic convictions without subordination.
 - Illustrate with case exemplars (book-by-book emphases in Carson's broader work): how Pauline, Johannine, Synoptic, and early catholic materials function theologically.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Allies: Brevard Childs (canonical criticism), Richard B. Hays (intertextual/theological reading), N. T. Wright (canonical and apostolic theology).
 - Critics and contrasts: classical historical-critical proponents (e.g., Bultmannian legacy), radical postliberal readings that downplay historical questions.
 - Wider resources: patristic and Reformation interpretive traditions, modern systematic theologians (for correlation).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration (hermeneutic of trust), Christology (centrality of the person and work of Christ), soteriology, ecclesiology, eschatology, implicit Trinitarian shaping of NT witness, apostolic authority and kerygma.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Carson's theological interpretation insists that faithful NT exegesis must be both historically disciplined and theologically serious - letting the apostolic witness shape doctrine and devotion without abandoning critical standards.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **pairing grammatical-historical exegesis with theological appropriation**; theology is not optional after exegesis but must follow from careful textual work.
 - Emphasis on the **apostolic kerygma** as the normative center of NT theological claims.
- **Corrections/contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against readings that either relativize historical questions (purely canonical or rhetorical moves) or that reduce texts to historical data devoid of theological force.
 - Corrects certain postliberal tendencies that ignore the church's confessional and doctrinal contexts for interpretation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Pragmatic synthesis: not a single new term but a clarified methodological vocabulary for "theological exegesis" that insists on both critical caution and doctrinal commitment.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in evangelical and Reformed seminaries as a corrective to extremes; shaped curricula in NT and hermeneutics courses.
 - Provoked debate with scholars who prioritize canonical or postmodern hermeneutics; respected by many as a balanced methodological statement.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a principled model for integrating NT studies with systematic theology and pastoral application; durable as a pedagogical framework for training pastors and scholars.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theological interpretation:** Reading Scripture primarily as theological discourse that forms faith and practice while retaining historical and textual discipline.
- **Grammatical-historical exegesis:** Careful attention to language, syntax, genre, and historical context; foundational, not sufficient by itself.
- **Canonical criticism:** Reading NT texts within the shape and authority of the canon; helps coordinate intertextual theological claims.
- **Apostolic kerygma:** The central preaching content of the apostles that grounds NT theological claims and ecclesial teaching.
- **Hermeneutic of trust:** Presumption that Scripture intends to communicate truth for faith, constrained by critical questions.
- **Hermeneutic of suspicion:** Critical skepticism toward text's claims; Carson advocates balance with trust, not wholesale suspicion.
- **Christocentric reading:** Prioritizing Christ's person and work as the key organizing center of NT theology.
- **Intertextuality:** Use of OT in NT to construct theological meaning; crucial for theological interpretation.
- **Typology:** Reading events, persons, and institutions as prefigurations fulfilled in Christ.
- **Doctrinal correlation:** Dialogue between exegetical findings and systematic theology, where neither dominates improperly.
- **Eschatological horizon:** Reading NT theology with attention to realized and future aspects of the kingdom.
- **Ecclesial appropriation:** The church's role in receiving, shaping, and applying NT theological claims.
- **Authorial intention:** Respect for what NT authors aimed to assert theologically and rhetorically.
- **Normative reading:** Theologically formed reading that yields doctrine and praxis for the believing community.
- **Historical responsibility:** Commitment to sound historical-critical methods as a guardrail for theological reading.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - Definition source: standard evangelical statement of what "theological interpretation" should mean.
 - Exegetical model: practical methodological guide for integrating grammar, history, and theology in NT exegesis.
 - Polemic: constructive rebuttal to extremes of both reductionist historicism and uncritical confessionalism.
