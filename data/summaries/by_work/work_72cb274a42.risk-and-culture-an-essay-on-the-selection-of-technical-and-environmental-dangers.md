### TITLE
Risk And Culture: An Essay On The Selection Of Technical And Environmental Dangers - Mary Douglas (with Aaron Wildavsky), 1982

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 1982 amid rising public controversies about nuclear power, chemical pollution, and new environmental movements.
 - Rooted in British cultural anthropology and Mary Douglas's program of symbolic analysis (after Purity and Danger).
 - Interdisciplinary engagement with political science (Aaron Wildavsky), risk analysis, and science & technology studies.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Perceptions of risk are not neutral technical readings of probability and consequence but socially constructed selections shaped by cultural biases and institutional forms.** What societies treat as a danger reflects social ordering, moral concerns, and institutional incentives.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduction of a **group-grid** schema to classify social organization and correlate it with characteristic risk perceptions.
 - Group: degree of belonging vs individual autonomy.
 - Grid: degree of prescriptive role differentiation and hierarchy.
 - Identification of four cultural types (and their risk emphases):
 - **Egalitarians**: fear of inequality-producing technologies, emphasize collective threats.
 - **Hierarchists**: trust expertise within ordered institutions, fear system collapse from unmanaged complexity.
 - **Individualists**: downplay collective hazards, fear regulatory overreach or constraints on enterprise.
 - **Fatalists**: marginalized, see little control over risks.
 - Argument that technical risk assessment cannot be dissociated from institutional incentives and symbolic meanings; technical experts themselves operate within cultural frames.
 - Case studies and comparisons showing how different societies/institutions select and prioritize different hazards.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Co-author Aaron Wildavsky (political scientist) and literature on public policy and risk.
 - Interlocution with technocratic risk assessment, economists (rational-choice), environmental activists, and prior anthropological work on purity, symbolism, and classification.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - No explicit systematic theological doctrines; **implicates ethical and communal doctrines**:
 - Ethics of stewardship and responsibility for future generations.
 - Social theology themes: sin, scapegoating, ritual purification, communal boundary maintenance.
 - Ecclesial responses to risk (public witness, care of creation) are interpretable through Douglas's typology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Risk judgments function as **moral-symbolic acts** that articulate and defend communal identities and social order, not merely transfers of technical data.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats risk as a cultural selection problem: hazards are chosen, not merely discovered.
 - Integrates institutional incentives with symbolic anthropology; experts are culturally located.
 - Moves risk analysis from epistemology (what we know) to social ontology (who we are).

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges the technocratic model that assumes public ignorance is the key problem; disputes simple rational-choice economic readings that reduce risk to expected utility calculations.
 - Contrasts with psychological models that locate bias in individual cognition by locating bias in social structure and cultural prescription.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of **group-grid** as a predictive schema for risk perception.
 - The term **selection of dangers** emphasizes active social filtering rather than passive reception.
 - Recasts concepts from Purity and Danger (boundary, pollution) into modern environmental and technological contexts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential across anthropology, sociology, political science, risk studies, and STS; became a staple reference for cultural approaches to risk.
 - Uptake in theology and ethics for analyzing environmental controversies, moral panic, scapegoating, and congregational responses to technological change.
 - Criticized for typological rigidity and for underplaying material inequalities and power dynamics in some readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact heuristic to link social organization with moral priorities; valuable for ministers, ethicists, and theologians studying communal reactions to environmental and technological dangers.
 - Durable as a corrective to purely technical or psychological accounts of risk.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Risk**
 - Socially selected perception of potential harm; not a purely probabilistic object.
- **Selection of dangers**
 - The process by which communities prioritize certain hazards while ignoring others.
- **Group-Grid**
 - Two-dimensional schema:
 - **Group**: strength of collective boundaries.
 - **Grid**: degree of role differentiation and rule-binding.
- **Cultural types**
 - **Egalitarian**, **Hierarchist**, **Individualist**, **Fatalist** - each with characteristic risk saliences.
- **Institutional bias**
 - The way institutional roles and incentives skew technical interpretations of danger.
- **Boundary maintenance**
 - Risk discourse as a means to police social or moral boundaries (continuity with purity/pollution themes).
- **Technical vs. social risk**
 - Distinction between hazards defined by experts (technical) and hazards emphasized due to cultural/moral concerns (social).
- **Symbolic classification**
 - The cultural codes that render some phenomena dangerous and others innocuous.
- **Scapegoating**
 - Mechanism by which communities externalize and manage perceived threats to identity.
- **Ritual/protection**
 - Practices (regulatory or symbolic) enacted to neutralize perceived dangers.
- **Public trust**
 - A variable conditioned by cultural type; crucial in acceptance of expert advice.
- **Dread/unknown**
 - Socially mediated affective responses to certain risks; not purely individual psychological states.
- **Expert culture**
 - Recognition that experts themselves are embedded in cultural frames and institutional constraints.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: provides a cultural definition of risk and a framework for diagnosing why different communities prioritize different hazards.
 - As a **polemic**: deployed against technocratic or purely economic models that presume neutrality of risk assessment.
 - As a **conceptual pivot/exegetical model**: used in theological ethics and ecclesial studies to read biblical purity laws, scapegoating, and congregational responses to environmental crises.
