### TITLE
The Protestant Face of Anglicanism - Paul F. M. Zahl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Anglican debates over identity: resurgence of Anglo‑Catholic ritualism vs. evangelical and Reformed wings; post‑war reassessments of authority, ecumenism, and liturgy.
 - Zahl writes as an Episcopal priest/theologian aligned with an active Protestant‑Reformed strain within Anglicanism, addressing both parish praxis and confessional theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Anglicanism must be read **fundamentally as Protestant**: its doctrinal center is the priority of Word and justification by faith; sacraments function within that Protestant frame rather than as independent channels of sacramental ontology.
 - Problem addressed: corrective to Anglo‑Catholic readings that make sacramental rite and sacramental presence the decisive locus of grace and church identity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical‑systematic presentation: recovers Reformation roots in Anglican formularies (Book of Common Prayer, 39 Articles, Cranmerian theology).
 - Theological claim: sacraments are **signs and seals** of promise - not automatic conferring of spiritual effect apart from faith and the Word.
 - Emphasizes preaching and Scripture as primary means of grace; sacraments are subordinate and require Word‑context to be efficacious.
 - Polemic move: critiques Anglo‑Catholic sacramental realism (ritualism, sacerdotalism) that elevates rites to quasi‑ontological mediators.
 - Pastoral implication: liturgy and sacramental practice should foster faith in Christ grounded in proclamation rather than ritual dependence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Positive retrievals: Thomas Cranmer, Richard Hooker, the 39 Articles, Book of Common Prayer.
 - Critiques directed at Anglo‑Catholic leaders and trends (ritualist movement, certain Oxford Movement emphases) and, implicitly, Roman Catholic sacramental theology.
 - Dialogues with Reformed and Lutheran sacramental theologies to clarify distinctions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacramental theology (baptism, Eucharist) - primary focus.
 - Soteriology (justification by faith), ecclesiology (identity of the church, ministry), authority (Scripture and formularies), worship and liturgy.
 - Secondary touchpoints: Christology as basis for sacraments, pneumatology in the reception of grace.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Zahl situates Anglican identity squarely within a Protestant confession: Word‑centered, Gospel‑dependent sacramental practice that resists sacramentalism as the church's defining feature.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Firm reassertion of the Book of Common Prayer and 39 Articles as normative for a Protestant Anglican theology rather than merely historical artifacts.
 - Robust insistence on the primacy of proclamation: the sermon and Scripture are the decisive, normative loci of grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Anglo‑Catholic tendencies to read Anglicanism as a via media toward Roman sacramental ontology; repositions Anglicanism closer to Reformed sacramental categories (sign/seal, spiritual presence).
 - Distinguishes Anglican via media as ecclesiological posture, not sacramental compromise.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframing "Protestant face" not as negation of catholicity but as an affirmation of Reformation essentials within Anglican catholicity.
 - Emphasizes relational rather than instrumental language about sacraments (sacraments as covenantal signs rather than magical instruments).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelical/Reformed Anglicans seeking apologetic and confessional resources against ritualist trends.
 - Less persuasive to Anglo‑Catholic and high‑church interpreters; served more as polemic and internal corrective than ecumenical bridge.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching sacramental theology in Anglican studies, clarifying confessional commitments; remains a concise resource for defining evangelical Anglican identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"Protestant face"** - Anglican identity construed primarily through Reformation convictions (Scripture, justification, Word).
- **Book of Common Prayer (BCP)** - treated as normative liturgical and theological grammar that evidences Protestant commitments.
- **39 Articles** - canonical touchstone for defining sacramental limits and Reformation theology in Anglicanism.
- **Word over sacrament** - principle that preaching/Scripture is the primary means of grace; sacraments derive efficacy from Word context.
- **Signs and seals** - Reformed model for sacraments; emphasizes representation and assurance rather than automatic change.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - Zahl critiques ontological or mechanical notions; efficacy is mediated by promise and faith.
- **Real presence (Anglo‑Catholic vs. Reformed)** - contrasts Anglo‑Catholic "objective presence" readings with a Reformed/spiritual/representational understanding.
- **Ritualism / Anglo‑Catholicism** - target of Zahl's critique for elevating external rites above Gospel proclamation.
- **Apostolic succession (ministerial)** - acknowledged as historical practice but not decisive for sacramental validity apart from Word and faith.
- **Justification by faith** - doctrinal center that governs reading of sacramental significance.
- **Lex orandi, lex credendi** - implicit appeal: liturgical practice must reflect confesssed Protestant doctrine.
- **Covenantal language** - sacraments framed in covenantal promise rather than sacramental ontology.
- **Catholicity redefined** - catholicity retained insofar as continuity of faith, not ritual or sacramental ontology.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical/Reformed Anglican identity and teaching on sacraments.
- As a **polemic** against Anglo‑Catholic sacramentalism and ritualism in ecclesial debates.
- As a **liturgical/theological model** emphasizing Word‑saturated worship where sacraments function as signs within proclamation.
