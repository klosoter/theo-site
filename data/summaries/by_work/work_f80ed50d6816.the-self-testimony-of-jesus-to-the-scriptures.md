### TITLE
**The Self-Testimony of Jesus to the Scriptures** 
Author: Geerhardus Vos 
Tradition: Princeton/Reformed biblical theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Produced within the late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton theological milieu; Vos writes as a biblical theologian reacting to rising historical-critical trends and to internal church debates about scriptural authority.
 - Methodologically shaped by Reformed confessional commitments and by an emphasis on redemptive-historical reading of Scripture.

- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus' own use, citation, and orientation toward the Old Testament constitute a decisive, internal ground for the Scriptures' authoritative status: the Messiah's self-testimony validates the canon and secures Scripture's self-attestation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrate that Jesus treats Old Testament texts as normative and binding (commands, citations, fulfillment claims).
 - Show that Christ's identity and messianic fulfillment give internal coherence and forward-directed teleology to the biblical corpus.
 - Argue that the authority of Scripture is not merely the product of ecclesiastical ratification or external proof, but is confirmed by Christ's public and normative appeals to Scripture.
 - Conclude that a Christ-centered hermeneutic both explains the canon's unity and repels reductive critical readings that detach texts from redemptive-historical fulfillment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Implicit engagement with higher-critical scholarship (historicism, source criticism) that relativizes Old Testament authority.
 - Conversation with Reformed predecessors (Calvinistic readings of Christ as interpreter of Scripture) and contemporaries at Princeton (e.g., Warfield) regarding inspiration and authority.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and incarnational), authority of Scripture, Christology (Christ as interpretive key), canon and tradition, hermeneutics (fulfillment-typology), and aspects of soteriology insofar as fulfillment discloses God's saving plan.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: Christ's authoritative self-testimony to Scripture secures the Bible's normativity and binds interpretation to the person and work of the Messiah.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places the person of Christ, not merely propositional prooftexts or ecclesial decrees, at the center of Scriptural authority; Scripture's credibility is shown within the economy of revelation by the Messiah's own appeals.
 - Treats fulfillment language and Christ's citations as canonical determinants rather than merely exegetical curiosities.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects approaches that root authority primarily in church reception or in abstract epistemic warrant; opposes purely historical-critical reduction that severs texts from redemptive-historical meaning.
 - More Christological and canonical in emphasis than some contemporaneous apologetic strategies that sought external corroboration for Scripture's truth.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the phrase/concept of "self-testimony" to describe how divine revelation authenticates itself through the incarnate Word's reference and fulfillment.
 - Advances a proto-canonical hermeneutic: the canon is read through Christ's testimonies and fulfillment patterns.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed scholarship as a model for Christ-centered biblical theology and canon theory.
 - Adopted by later theologians and pastors who argue for a Christological grounding of biblical authority; less influential among liberal-critical circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for courses on hermeneutics, canon, and Christology; provides a concise theological rationale linking Christology and scriptural authority for preaching and apologetics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-testimony** - The claim that Scripture bears witness to itself through Christ's use and fulfillment of Old Testament texts.
- **Self-attestation** - The doctrine that Scripture's authority is intrinsically ratified in the economy of revelation, particularly by Christ.
- **Canonical authority** - Authority grounded in the canon's unified testimony realized in and through Christ.
- **Christological hermeneutic** - Reading Scripture with Christ (his person and work) as the primary interpretive key.
- **Fulfillment** - Jesus' fulfillment of Old Testament promise/typology as validating prior revelation and completing its meaning.
- **Typology / redemptive-historical reading** - The method that traces correspondences and progressions culminating in Christ; central to Vos's approach.
- **Normative citation** - The use by Jesus of Scripture as binding and authoritative speech-act.
- **Economy of revelation** - The unfolding of God's self-disclosure culminating in the incarnation; a framework for understanding canonical unity.
- **Ecclesial reception vs. intrinsic witness** - Contrast between authority derived from church reception and authority revealed through Christ's testimony; Vos prioritizes the latter.
- **Hermeneutical consequence** - Interpretive practice that requires reading OT texts in the light of Christ's person and work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a primary reference for **Self Attestation And Authority Of Scripture**: supplies a Christ-centered theological justification for Scripture's intrinsic authority in systematic and apologetic treatments.
 - As an interpretive model in **Canon And Tradition** discussions: supports a canonical, fulfillment-focused account of how the New Testament validates and interprets the Old, influencing debates about canon formation and ecclesial reception.
