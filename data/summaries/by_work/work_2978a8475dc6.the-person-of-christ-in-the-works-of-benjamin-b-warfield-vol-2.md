### TITLE
**The Person of Christ** (The Works of Benjamin B. Warfield, Vol. 2)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th - early 20th century Princeton theology; Warfield writing as a conservative Reformed scholastic concerned with dogmatic clarity against modernist criticism and speculative innovations.
 - Movement: post-Reformation, Reformed orthodoxy renewed in a Princeton analytic-scholastic idiom; engagement with patristic, medieval, and contemporary continental discussions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate, with metaphysical precision and biblical fidelity, the Chalcedonian claim that Jesus Christ is one Person (hypostasis) who subsists in two unconfused, inseparable natures (divine and human), and to show how this doctrine secures redemption, revelation, and worship.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data establishing both deity and humanity of Christ.
 - Systematic analysis of the terms **person** (hypostasis) and **nature** (physis), insisting on their distinct ontological categories.
 - Defense of the **Hypostatic Union**: explanation of how two natures are united in one Person without mixture, change, division, or confusion.
 - Detailed refutation of rivals:
 - One-person language tendencies that efface natures (see: **Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique**).
 - Kenotic and functionalist accounts that posit alteration of divine essence.
 - Modalistic or Nestorian misreadings.
 - Trinitarian grounding: treatment of **Eternal Generation And Spiration** to secure Son's eternal personal identity and the Spirit's procession vis-a-vis incarnation.
 - Practical corollaries: soteriology, atonement, and the communicative use of predicates (**Communicatio Idiomatum**) in Scripture and worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Chalcedon, Augustine, Athanasius, later scholastics, Calvin; critiques of contemporary theologians proposing kenosis or reductionist person-language (e.g., modernists and certain one-person advocates, identified in Warfield's polemical context with early 20th-century revisionists).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology centrally; secondary treatment of Trinity (generation, spiration), soteriology, revelation, and doctrine of Scripture as witness to the person and work.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Warfield insists that a rigorously defined hypostatic union, anchored in Chalcedonian categories and Trinitarian relations, is the indispensable key to orthodox Christology - preserving both the fullness of deity and the reality of human experience in the one Mediator.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in distinguishing ontological categories (hypostasis vs. physis) with methodological commitment to metaphysical realism.
 - Insistence that Christ's personhood is the primary axis for predication without collapsing natures - a balance of unity and distinction.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes "one-nature" or loose one-person rhetoric that collapses human/divine properties (critiqued under the rubric **Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique**).
 - Rejects kenoticism and any view implying alteration of divine essence; insists on impassibility and immutability ordered through the person's assumption of human properties.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Mature Reformed appropriation of Chalcedonian language with analytic clarification of communicatio idiomatum - how attributes transfer without ontological confusion.
 - Use of Trinitarian doctrines (eternal generation, spiration) to undergird Christ's personal identity pre- and post-incarnation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a standard statement of classical Christology; used in seminary teaching and in debates against modernist and liberal Christologies.
 - Cited in subsequent defenses of Chalcedonian orthodoxy and in rebuttals to kenotic and existentialist Christologies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models disciplined interaction of biblical exegesis, historical dogma, and metaphysical analysis; valuable as a corrective to fuzzy person-language and for teaching the communicatio idiomatum responsibly.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The real, personal union of two complete natures (divine and human) in the one Person of the Son; central explanatory category.
- **Person (Hypostasis)**
 - Ontological subject who possesses and exercises the natures; personhood secures identity through incarnation.
- **Nature (Physis)**
 - Principle of operation and properties (divine or human) which are not reduced to personhood.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine**
 - The standard formula Warfield defends: one Person in two natures, "without confusion, without change, without division, without separation."
- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - The legitimate attribution of properties from one nature to the person (and thus, contextually, to the other nature) without ontological transfer; Warfield clarifies limits and uses.
- **Eternal Generation**
 - The Son's eternal derivation from the Father; used to anchor the Son's personal identity antecedent to the incarnation and to oppose adoptionist schemes.
- **Spiration**
 - The procession of the Spirit (single vs. double spiration debates); employed to link Trinitarian relations to the economy of redemption.
- **Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique**
 - Label for approaches that overemphasize person-terminology at the expense of nature-distinction; Warfield's critique reasserts Chalcedonian balance.
- **Kenosis**
 - Theories proposing self-emptying that alter divine attributes; Warfield rejects any ontological diminution of deity.
- **Communicative Predication**
 - The practice of ascribing to Jesus predicates drawn from either nature properly mediated by personhood.
- **Immutability / Impassibility**
 - Divine attributes preserved in the incarnation by virtue of personal mode of assumption.
- **Incarnation**
 - The historical event wherein the eternal Son assumes human nature - the focal case for Warfield's metaphysical exposition.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for Chalcedonian and Reformed Christology.
 - As **polemic** against kenoticism, one-person elisions, and modernist reductions.
 - As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating how Scripture's predicate logic about Christ is to be read in light of hypostatic union.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian relations (eternal generation, spiration) to the economy of the incarnation and soteriology.
