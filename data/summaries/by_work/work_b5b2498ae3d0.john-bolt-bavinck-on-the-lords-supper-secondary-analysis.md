### TITLE
John Bolt, "Bavinck on the Lord's Supper" (secondary analysis of Herman Bavinck's sacramentology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-19th / early-20th-century Dutch Reformed theology (Herman Bavinck, 1854-1921). Bavinck writes within the Dutch neo-Calvinist and Gereformeerde Kerk milieu, responding to Roman Catholic sacramentalism, Lutheran realism, Zwinglian memorialism, and modernist reductions of sacrament to mere symbol. Bolt (contemporary scholar) provides an English-language synthetic analysis that situates Bavinck historically and theologically.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Bavinck aims to define the Lord's Supper as a covenantal sign and means of grace wherein Christ is truly present in a spiritual, real way-avoiding both corporeal presence doctrines and mere memorialism-while preserving the necessity of faith and the church's pastoral discipline in admission (fencing).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: close reading of institution texts (e.g., 1 Cor 11) and New Testament sacramental language.
 - Historical survey: evaluates patristic, medieval, and Reformation positions (Luther, Zwingli, Calvin) to identify strengths and failures.
 - Theological synthesis: develops a Reformed realism-distinguishing signum/res but affirming real communion with Christ by the Spirit, grounded in union with Christ.
 - Pastoral-ecclesial application: treats fencing and admission, arguing for ordered, catechetical reception of the sacrament without turning the table into a purely sectarian tool.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Herman Bavinck (primary), John Bolt (analyst), Calvin and Reformed confessions (Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession), Roman Catholic scholasticism, Luther and Zwingli as typological rivals, later Reformed thinkers (Kuyper, Warfield).
- **Doctrines treated:** Sacramentology, covenant theology, Christology (presence and mediation), pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental reception), ecclesiology (discipline, admission), soteriology (union with Christ, application of redemption).
- **Closing line:** Bavinck (as read by Bolt) centers the Lord's Supper on covenantal communion effected by the Spirit: a genuine, non-corporeal participation in Christ that unites objective promise and subjective faith within ordered church life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on a **real spiritual presence**-not a local corporeal presence, not mere symbolism.
 - Careful distinction between **sign (bread/wine)** and **thing signified (Christ's body/blood, heavenly reality)** while avoiding a sterile separation.
 - Emphasis on the **pneumatic mediation**: the Holy Spirit unites communicants to Christ in the supper.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects Zwinglian memorialism by insisting on real benefit and presence.
 - Rejects Roman transubstantiation and Lutheran corporeal ubiquity while preserving a Reformed realism rooted in union with Christ.
 - Moderates confessional strictness: affirms fencing/admission but warns against rigid legalism that overlooks pastoral concern and individual conscience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refined use of classical sign/res language to stress relational and soteriological function of sacraments.
 - Terminology emphasizing "participation by faith through the Spirit" as the locus of sacramental efficacy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Bolt's analysis has made Bavinck's nuanced sacramentology accessible to anglophone Reformed scholarship.
 - Bavinck's approach has influenced contemporary Reformed sacramental theology and ecumenical discussions, often used to articulate a mediating Reformed position.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models integration of biblical exegesis, historical theology, and systematic synthesis.
 - Offers a pastoralized sacramentology useful for preaching, catechesis, and church order debates about communion and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper:** The covenant meal instituted by Christ as sign and means of grace.
- **Real spiritual presence:** Christ truly present in the supper by the Spirit, enabling genuine communion without bodily ubiquity.
- **Signum / res (sign and thing signified):** Classical distinction Bavinck uses to protect both the objective reality and the symbolic form.
- **Union with Christ:** Ontological ground for sacramental participation; believers partake in Christ by virtue of this union.
- **Pneumatic mediation:** The role of the Holy Spirit in applying Christ's benefits in the sacrament.
- **Objective efficacy / instrumental means:** The supper is objectively efficacious as a means ordained by Christ; efficacy is instrumental, realized in the believer by faith.
- **Subjective reception (faith):** Faith is necessary for the sacrament to be beneficial; the sacrament does not automatically confer blessing absent faith.
- **Fencing the table:** Church practice of regulating admission to safeguard covenant integrity and pastoral care.
 - Sub-contrast: strict exclusionism vs. pastoral inclusion with catechetical preparation.
- **Covenant sign and seal:** The supper functions as both a sign pointing to covenant realities and a seal confirming God's promises.
- **Memorialism (rejected):** The view that the supper is only a remembrance; Bavinck rejects this as insufficient.
- **Transubstantiation / corporeal presence (rejected):** Bavinck denies local/material change/ubiquity of Christ's body.
- **Sacramental participation:** Participation understood as real communion with Christ and the church through Spirit-enabled faith.
- **Ecclesial discipline:** The theological rationale for admission rules and the pastoral purpose of fencing.
- **Mystery and realism:** Bavinck's persistent move to hold mystery and objective reality together against speculative reduction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced Reformed sacramentology that affirms real spiritual presence.
- As a **polemic** against both memorialism and transubstantiation without resorting to caricature.
- As an **exegetical-model and historical-synthetic resource** for teaching sacraments, covenant theology, and pastoral order (admission/fencing).
