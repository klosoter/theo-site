### TITLE
The New Being - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-20th-century Protestant theology; Tillich's mature existential-religious ontology (post-WWI, interwar, WWII intellectual milieu).
 - Moves within liberal/neo-orthodox dialogue, engaging existentialism (Kierkegaard), German idealism (Hegel), and modern biblical criticism (Bultmann).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ is the ontological event of the "New Being": a decisive transformation of human existence disclosed in the person, work, death, resurrection, and Spirit of Jesus.
 - The central problem: how to speak of Christ's deity, humanity, and salvific efficacy without reverting to metaphysical substance-language or reducing Christ to moral example.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: human existence is estranged, finite, and anxious; traditional metaphysical categories fail to communicate salvation to modern consciousness.
 - Proposal: reinterpret Christology existentially - Christ as the manifestation of God as the Ground of Being and as the realized possibility of authentic human existence (the New Being).
 - Mechanism:
 - Incarnation as God's self-revelation in an historical, existential form - not merely a metaphysical hypostatic statement but an event that addresses estrangement.
 - Resurrection and Spirit are the ontological actualizers of New Being; union with Christ is participation in that ontological change.
 - Theological categories (e.g., Sonship, two natures, kenosis) must be rephrased in symbolic/relational and existential terms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Hegel and Kierkegaard for dialectic of being and existence; Bultmann on demythologizing; Schleiermacher on feeling and religion; critiques classical scholasticism and natural theology; interacts critically with Barthian emphases while also sharing anti-metaphysical concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): incarnation, two natures, eternal sonship, impeccability, messianic consciousness, kingdom.
 - **Soteriology**: union with Christ, justification/participation as ontological transformation rather than forensic status.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as the dynamic that actualizes the New Being in believers and the church.
 - Ancillary: revelation, resurrection, revelation-language (symbolic vs. literal).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Tillich reframes Christology so that salvation is an ontological transformation - the historical Christ as the event in which the Ground of Being creates a new mode of existence for humanity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Christ as *event* and ontological "New Being" rather than primarily a metaphysical bearer of divine attributes or a forensic substitute.
 - God described as **Ground of Being**; revelation occurs when the Ground enters history in the New Being.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects both reductionist liberal moral exemplarism and scholastic substance metaphysics that treat hypostatic union as static metaphysics.
 - Distances from Barthian insistence on transcendence by holding to a dynamic interplay of transcendence and immanence (God as Ground manifesting in history).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Recasting classical terms (Sonship, kenosis, two natures, impeccability) into existential-functional language:
 - Sonship: relational function within history, not merely ontological ordering.
 - Kenosis: interpreted as existential self-limitation/receptivity within the event of revelation, not the partial loss of divinity.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberal and existentialist theological circles; formative for 20th-century Protestant retrievals of Christology, theological anthropology, and ecumenical reflection.
 - Criticized by conservative and some neo-orthodox theologians for alleged relativizing of doctrines and for symbolic language that downplays creedal metaphysics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust resource for interpreting union with Christ as ontological participation; fruitful for pastoral theology, modern theological anthropology, and interdisciplinary work (philosophy of religion, existential ethics).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Being**
 - The decisive ontological change effected by Christ; salvific reality made present in resurrection and Spirit.
- **Ground of Being**
 - Tillich's name for God; the ultimate depth-source whose self-revelation is Christ.
- **Incarnation (existential reading)**
 - God's self-manifestation as an historical event that discloses the possibility of authentic human existence.
- **Eternal Sonship (functional)**
 - Sonship as the role of divine self-revelation realized in history rather than a static ontological ordering external to historical revelation.
- **Kenosis (reinterpreted)**
 - Divine self-limitation as existential vulnerability and acceptance of finitude in the event of revelation, not metaphysical subtraction of attributes.
- **Two Natures / Chalcedonian rearticulation**
 - Read as a unity of divine-human reality in the singular event that reconciles depth-dimension and finite existence; Chalcedon preserved as theological grammar but reframed existentially.
- **Impeccability (existential freedom)**
 - Christ's freedom from sin understood as depth-integrity of being, not merely incapacity; moral obedience arises from realized New Being.
- **Union with Christ (participation)**
 - Ontological participation in the New Being effected by Spirit; soteriology centers on changed mode of existence rather than solely legal status.
- **Spirit (actualizer)**
 - The dynamic presence that makes the New Being present and effective in believers and community.
- **Resurrection (ontological vindication)**
 - The event that discloses and consummates the New Being; ground for Christian hope.
- **Messianic consciousness / Kingdom**
 - Christ's self-awareness and proclamation framed as revelation of the in-breaking of the New Being and the kingdom as realized existential possibility.
- **Revelation (symbolic language)**
 - Theology as interpretation of symbols; doctrine functions to point to the event of the Ground's presence.
- **Paradox and Correlation**
 - Use of existential paradox (finite/infinite) and method of correlation between human question and divine answer.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: supplies an existential definition of Christology and soteriology for modern theology syllabi.
 - Polemic: used to critique both metaphysical scholasticism and reductive moralism in Christology.
 - Exegetical/constructive model: employed as a hermeneutical template for Pauline union language and pneumatological accounts of sanctification.
 - Conceptual pivot: functions as a bridge between philosophy of religion (ontology) and constructive systematic theology in post-Enlightenment contexts.
