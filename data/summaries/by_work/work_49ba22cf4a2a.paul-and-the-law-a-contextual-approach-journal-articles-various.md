### TITLE
Paul and the Law: A Contextual Approach (journal articles, various) - Robert H. Gundry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century, evangelical New Testament scholarship responding to the emergence of the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) represented by E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, and related work by N. T. Wright. Gundry writes as a conservative/evangelical exegete intent on situating Paul in his first-century context while defending traditional forensic readings.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Gundry argues that Paul's critique of the law is primarily about the law's inability to **justify** and its usurpation of God's forensic declaration - not merely a sociological marker of ethnic boundary. He defends **forensic imputation** (legal declaration of righteousness) against NPP re-readings that minimize Pauline legal language.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Careful contextual exegesis of key Pauline passages (especially Romans and Galatians) to establish Paul's use of legal/forensic vocabulary.
 - Close lexical and syntactical work on terms like δικαιοσύνη, δικαιόω, πιστις, and ἔργα τοῦ νόμου to show traditional meanings remain viable.
 - Critique of NPP's sociological emphasis (e.g., "works of the law" as boundary markers) for failing to account adequately for forensic motifs and Paul's salvation vocabulary.
 - Reassertion of Reformation categories (justification, imputation, forensic declaration) as both historically and exegetically defensible.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (by implication), plus classical scholastic/Reformation interpreters of Paul; extensive engagement with Pauline corpus and Jewish background studies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Justification (primary), imputation (forensic imputation), law (function and critique), covenantal relations (background), soteriology, Pauline Christology insofar as it grounds justification.
- **Closing line:** Gundry's theological center of gravity is a rigorous, context-shaped defense of **Pauline forensic justification and imputation** against sociological re-descriptions that would neutralize the law/faith contrast central to Reformation soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **forensic language** and legal metaphors in Paul as normative for understanding justification.
 - Emphasizes careful lexical, syntactical, and rhetorical exegesis over broad sociological readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on NPP claims that "works of the law" chiefly denote boundary markers (circumcision, food laws); insists many Pauline usages retain a **meritorious/legal** sense.
 - Challenges the NPP tendency to treat righteousness language primarily as covenantal status rather than forensic declaration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes NPP debates by insisting on a **contextual approach** that integrates first-century Jewish practice but privileges Pauline legal idiom where present.
 - Refines use of "imputation" to stress its forensic, declarative aspect rather than merely participatory or covenantal membership.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued among conservative and Reformed circles as a robust exegetical rebuttal to NPP claims.
 - Criticized by NPP proponents as preserving anachronistic or doctrinally driven categories; nevertheless, Gundry influenced subsequent defenders of forensic readings.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a methodological model for combining historical-contextual sensitivity with rigorous grammatical-exegetical discipline.
 - Useful as a corrective when sociological readings risk eclipsing explicit legal/forensic language in Paul.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - Gundry treats as primarily **forensic**: God's legal declaration that a believer is righteous.
- **Forensic Imputation**
 - Central term: righteousness is **imputed** (credited) to the believer, not merely inferred from covenant membership.
- **Imputation vs. Participation**
 - Contrasts imputation (declarative legal act) with NPP-inclined participatory/covenantal language; Gundry defends imputation's exegetical warrant.
- **Works of the Law (erga tou nomou)**
 - Gundry argues many contexts show **merit-oriented** or legalistic connotations, not only ethnic boundary markers.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Treated as a major interlocutor; Gundry critiques its tendency to minimize forensic readings and its sociological framing.
- **Covenantal Nomism**
 - Gundry acknowledges Jewish covenantal frameworks but resists the conclusion that Paul's rhetoric is primarily about boundary maintenance.
- **Righteousness (dikaiosyne)**
 - Read as both **attribute of God** and forensic status conferred upon believers through imputation.
- **Faith (pistis)**
 - Emphasized as **trust/faith** that grounds reception of the forensic declaration; Gundry resists reducing pistis to faithfulness only.
- **Law (nomos)**
 - Analyzed for multiple functions: pedagogical revealer of sin, attempted means of merit, and boundary marker - but Gundry stresses its failure as a means of justification.
- **Forensic Language (dikaioo, dikaiosis, dikaios)**
 - Gundry highlights these verbs/nouns as evidence for a legal reading of Paul.
- **Grace (charis)**
 - Functions as the divine basis for the forensic declaration; contrasted with law-based merit.
- **Contextual Approach**
 - Method: marry first-century Jewish background with careful grammatical-historical exegesis to resist over-systematic re-reads.
- **Exegesis as Polemical Tool**
 - Gundry uses exegesis not merely descriptive but as corrective strategy against interpretive trends.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for defending forensic imputation in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** and exegetical exemplar in debates with the NPP.
 - As an **exegetical model** in Pauline studies emphasizing lexical-syntactic analysis over solely sociological frameworks.
