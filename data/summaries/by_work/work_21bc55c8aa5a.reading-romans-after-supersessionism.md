### TITLE
Reading Romans after Supersessionism - Christopher Zoccali

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** contemporary Reformed scholarship reacting to long-standing Christian supersessionist readings of Paul. Emerges within renewed interest (late 20th-21st c.) in Jewish-Christian relations, Pauline theology, and covenant theology revisions.
- **Central thesis:** Zoccali argues that Romans must be read without presupposing supersessionism; when read on its own terms Paul upholds continued divine faithfulness to Israel while explaining Gentile inclusion - so Romans resists a simple "replacement" model and requires a post‑supersessionist hermeneutic.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Interprets Romans as a sustained covenantal argument about God's faithfulness to promises to Israel and the incorporation of Gentiles by promise and mercy.
 - Re-examines Romans 9-11 as the hinge of Paul's theology: election and the olive‑tree metaphor preserve Israel's future and limit claims that the church has replaced Israel.
 - Reads justification and righteousness in covenantal and corporate terms rather than primarily individual forensic categories; justification marks covenant membership (Jew and Gentile).
 - Argues that Paul's use of the law, promise, and faith must be understood within a continuity of God's covenantal plan, not a wholesale abrogation of Jewish promise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (especially letters to Romans passages 3-11).
 - Dialogues with modern Pauline interpreters (broadly N. T. Wright, John Barclay, and other recent covenantal/readings) and with classical Reformed interpreters who read Paul in supersessionist terms (Augustine/Calvin as paradigmatic antecedents).
 - Engages secondary literature on Jewish-Gentile relations, covenant theology, and recent critiques of Christian supersessionism.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant, election, justification, ecclesiology (identity of church and Israel), eschatology (future of Israel), law and promise, divine faithfulness, typology and promise fulfillment.
- **Closing line (summary center of gravity):** Romans read after supersessionism is a corrective that recovers Paul's covenantal fidelity to Israel and reframes justification and election as instruments of God's ongoing promises to both Jews and Gentiles.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insists on a hermeneutic posture: adopt a "post‑supersessionist" reading posture before exegeting Romans, so that Paul's continuity with Israel is not read out as anomalous.
 - Treats justification as primarily covenantal status - a communal marker that secures promise‑bearing identity, not mere individual legal standing.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Challenges classic supersessionist readings that make Israel's covenantal promises null and void once the church exists.
 - Corrects some Reformed traditions that too quickly equate the church with Israel, arguing instead for continuity-with-distinction modeled in Romans 9-11.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advances the term **post‑supersessionist hermeneutic** (practical description) - a reading stance that refuses replacement assumptions and seeks covenantal coherence.
 - Emphasizes **covenantal plurality** - one divine plan, multiple covenant recipients (Jew and Gentile) in relational tension rather than unilateral abrogation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Gaining attention in circles rethinking covenant theology and Jewish‑Christian ethics; used in seminars on Romans and on Jewish‑Christian relations.
 - Provokes pushback from defenders of traditional replacement readings but is appreciated for its careful exegetical focus on Romans 9-11.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a corrective resource in courses on Pauline theology, covenant theology, and ecclesiology.
 - Useful for educators addressing Christian attitudes toward Judaism and for pastors seeking a theologically coherent posture toward God's promises to Israel.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Supersessionism / Replacement Theology:** the doctrine that the church has replaced Israel as God's covenant people; Zoccali argues readers should reject this as an interpretive presupposition.
- **Post‑supersessionist hermeneutic:** reading stance promoted by Zoccali that refrains from assuming replacement and seeks covenantal continuity.
- **Covenant / covenantal faithfulness:** central category; God's ongoing fidelity to promises to Israel and Gentiles as partners in a single salvific economy.
- **Election:** treated corporately and eschatologically; not the erasure of Israel but the locating of the remnant and future purpose.
- **Remnant:** motif used to explain Israel's preservation and future hope in Paul's argument (Romans 9-11).
- **Olive‑tree metaphor:** Paul's emblem for continuity-with-distinction; Zoccali reads it as anti‑replacement rather than evidence of ecclesial absorption.
- **Justification:** emphasized as covenantal membership/status (covenantal righteousness) rather than only forensic acquittal.
- **Promise:** the axis around which Paul's argument turns - promises to Abraham remain operative and inclusive.
- **Law:** discussed in relation to promise; law does not nullify covenantal promises but defines boundaries and behaviors for covenant members.
- **Inclusion of Gentiles:** seen as incorporation by promise and mercy, not substitution of Israel.
- **Eschatology:** future of Israel affirmed; divine wrath and mercy cohere toward eventual restoration motifs.
- **Corporate identity:** the church and Israel as distinct yet related corporate entities within God's plan.
- **Hermeneutical posture:** practical instruction for interpreters to avoid hidden supersessionist assumptions.
- **Covenantal plurality:** conceptual phrase describing multiple recipients of God's one covenantal plan.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for Romans that foregrounds covenantal continuity and careful reading of Romans 9-11.
- As a **polemic** against supersessionism in systematic and pastoral contexts, reshaping ecclesiological and missional attitudes.
- As a **definition source** for the post‑supersessionist approach in contemporary covenant theology debates.
