### TITLE
Creation, Fall, Restoration - Andrew S. Kulikovsky

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary biblical-theological treatment emerging from conservative Evangelical / Seventh‑day Adventist academic contexts. Written amid renewed interest (late 20th-21st c.) in canonical readings of Genesis and critiques of naturalistic and non‑literal accounts of origins.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Bible presents a coherent, canonical narrative in which the original creational order (made good by God) is disrupted by a historical Fall; God's redemptive work in Christ aims not only at personal salvation but at the full restoration of creation to its intended ordered state.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical focus on early chapters of Genesis as foundational for anthropology, sin, and covenantal order.
 - The Fall is treated as an actual event with corporate and cosmic consequences (human alienation, disorder in creation, curse).
 - Pauline and prophetic texts (esp. Romans, Genesis typology, Psalms, Isaiah) are read to show continuity: Adam as representative/head; Christ as federal antitype who effects restoration.
 - Restoration is cosmic and eschatological: inaugurated in Christ (first fruits) and consummated in the new creation; moral and liturgical implications (Sabbath, stewardship) flow from this vision.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Canonical Scripture (Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Romans, Revelation); classical and Reformation interpreters (as foil) and contemporary scholars in biblical theology, creation care, and origins debates. Dialogue with both liberalizing readings that mythologize Genesis and with scientific accounts that exclude theological meaning.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation, anthropology (imago Dei), original sin/Fall, covenant (Adamic/creation covenant), Christology (Adam-Christ typology), soteriology (redemption and new creation), eschatology (consummation), and practical doctrines (ethics, Sabbath, stewardship).
- **Closing line:** The work centers theology on a canonical narrative in which the historical Fall ruptures God's good creational order and Christ's redemptive work is the theologically necessary, cosmic restoration of that order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the *cosmic* and *corporate* dimensions of the Fall - not merely individual moral failure but disorder affecting the whole created order.
 - Emphasizes the continuity of purpose from creation covenant to eschatological restoration.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against non‑historical or purely literary readings of Genesis that sideline the Fall's historicity.
 - Challenges reductionist naturalistic accounts that privatize redemption to individual souls, insisting on creation‑wide soteriology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes creation language in covenantal/representative terms (Adam as covenantal head; Christ as covenantal restorer).
 - Articulates "restoration" as both juridical/forensic and ontological (reordering of creation structures).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Receives attention in conservative evangelical and Adventist circles as a clarifying canonical treatment; less uptake among liberal or radically critical scholars.
 - Cited modestly as a resource for integrating biblical exegesis with doctrinal formulation on origins and eschatology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful compact synthesis for courses on biblical theology, doctrine of creation, and ecological/ethical theology.
 - Serves as a pedagogical bridge between exegetical work on Genesis and systematic concerns about sin, Christ, and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creation:** God's original ordering of cosmos as "very good"; foundation for covenantal obligations.
- **Imago Dei:** Human identity and role as image-bearers; basis for dignity, vocation, and stewardship.
- **Fall:** Historical rupture initiated by human disobedience; corporate and cosmic consequences.
- **Original sin / corporate solidarity:** Sin as inherited relationally through Adam as representative head; communal effects.
- **Covenant (creation/Adamic):** Framework that links creation order to moral and liturgical responsibilities.
- **Curse / disorder:** Theological language for structural disruptions in nature and human life post‑Fall.
- **Adam-Christ typology:** Adam as covenantal head; Christ as federal antitype effecting restoration.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** Restoration begun in Christ (first fruits) and awaiting consummation in new creation.
- **Redemption of creation:** Soteriology extended beyond individual souls to cosmic renewal.
- **Sabbath / worship ethics:** Liturgical sign and ethical reminder of creation's intent and its restoration.
- **Canonical reading:** Interpreting Genesis within the whole canon to preserve theological coherence.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity:** Emphasis on continuity between creation intent, fall, and eschatological goal.
- **Theological anthropology:** Integration of sin, image, and vocation within creational covenant.
- **Creation care / stewardship:** Practical outworking of restoration theology in ecological ethics.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for teaching doctrines of creation, Fall, and redemption that stress corporate/cosmic dimensions.
 - As a **polemic** against non‑historic readings of Genesis and narrow privatized soteriologies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis and Pauline texts in canonical and covenantal fashion.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for ethics and ecological theology connecting creational order to eschatological hope.
