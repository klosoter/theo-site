### TITLE
Sermons: "A Divine and Supernatural Light" / "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God" - Jonathan Edwards

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 18th-century New England (Great Awakening milieu). Edwards (Congregationalist pastor and theologian) preached within revivalist contexts (1730s-1740s). These sermons address immediate pastoral crises of conversion and critiques of mere intellectual religion.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed Puritanism confronting Enlightenment rationalism, Arminian-sympathetic revival critics, and pastoral need for assurances of authentic conversion.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - "A Divine and Supernatural Light": True saving faith arises from an immediate, supernatural illumination by the Spirit that reveals Christ and alters affections - not from mere intellectual assent or outward external means.
 - "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God": Unregenerate persons are under imminent divine wrath and can only be spared by God's sovereign mercy; conviction of sin and vivid sense of danger are necessary preludes to conversion.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - "A Divine and Supernatural Light"
 - Diagnosis: Many profess faith but lack inward spiritual illumination.
 - Positive claim: There is a distinct operation of the Spirit that makes Christ/Divine truth immediately evident to the soul.
 - Pastoral implication: Authentic conversion is experiential and wrought by God alone; ministers must pray for and depend on this illumination.
 - "Sinners in the Hands of an Angry God"
 - Opening: Scripture-based depiction of God's wrath and human peril.
 - Exposition: Human depravity and inability to save oneself; God's sovereignty holds sinners over destruction.
 - Appeal: Elicit terror of sin to drive sinners to seek mercy; warn of imminent judgment while offering Gospel hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Cites Scripture heavily; draws on Puritan writers (e.g., Owen, Baxter implicitly), Augustine and Calvin as theological antecedents.
 - Opposes Enlightenment rationalism and sentimental or moral-only religion; counters Arminian emphases on human ability with Reformed accounts of depravity and grace.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Illumination (special supernatural light).
 - Divine sovereignty, decrees, election and reprobation (implicit and explicit in the rhetoric of wrath/mercy).
 - Human depravity, inability, conversion, assurance, and the experiential life of faith (affections).
 - Providence and God's active role in salvation and judgment.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Edwards centers Reformed orthodoxy in an experiential, sovereign theology: salvation is the supernatural work of God's illuminating and electing grace, and unregenerate persons remain under imminent divine wrath until that work is performed.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence on a qualitatively distinct "divine and supernatural light" as the mark of true conversion (not merely moral reform or intellectual belief).
 - Rhetorical fusion of doctrinal severity (wrath, decrees) with pastoral urgency and psychological vividness.
 - Attention to the affections as central to genuine faith - conversion involves a heart-transformation, not only assent.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Enlightenment/Rationalist accounts by rejecting mere intellectual illumination or moralism.
 - Counters Arminian claims of sufficient human ability; stresses efficaciousness of divine grace and the impotence of the unregenerate will without God's operation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Distinction between natural ability and moral ability (developed elsewhere but operative here) - sinners may have natural faculties yet lack moral disposition to choose God.
 - Vivid pastoral metaphors (e.g., held over the pit of hell) that operationalize abstract doctrines of wrath and decree for lay imagination.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Immediate: Instrumental in the Great Awakening; sparked revivalist fervor and also controversy (critics accused Edwards of fomenting fanaticism).
 - Long-term: Shaped evangelical revival practice, American Protestant imagination, and later Reformed experiential theology; cited by Calvinists as exemplar of pastoral concern rooted in high doctrine.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Models integration of systematic Reformed theology with pastoral homiletics.
 - Provides a compact, forceful articulation of election, divine wrath, and the necessity of sovereign illumination for conversion.
 - Useful in debates over assurance, conversion, and the nature of saving faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine and Supernatural Light**: Immediate Holy Spirit illumination that makes Christ and spiritual realities manifest to the soul; the sine qua non of saving faith.
- **Illumination (special)**: Distinct from natural reason; a regenerating perception granted by God.
- **Sovereignty of God**: God's control over salvation and judgment; explains both mercy and wrath.
- **Wrath of God**: Active judicial anger toward sin; portrayed as imminent danger for the unregenerate.
- **Election**: God's eternal choice of some to salvation; implicit in the sermon's stress on divine initiative and mercy.
- **Reprobation**: The converse of election; sinners remain under just condemnation apart from divine mercy.
- **Total Depravity**: Human inability to will God rightly without divine intervention.
- **Natural vs Moral Ability**: Natural ability = capacity to perform actions; moral ability = willing what is spiritually good; Edwards emphasizes lack of moral ability as the problem.
- **Efficacious Grace**: Grace that infallibly brings about conversion when God chooses to apply it.
- **Affections**: The heart's inclinations; true religion reorders affections toward God.
- **Conversion (New Birth)**: God's transformative act-illumination plus reorientation of affections and will.
- **Providence**: God's governance by which He sustains sinners and may permit or withhold temporal deliverance.
- **Revivalism**: The practical outworking of these sermons; emphasis on awakenings, conviction, and converted communities.
- **Experimental Religion**: Knowledge of God as validated by inward experience and transformed affections.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed accounts of illumination, conversion, and the role of affections.
 - As a **polemic** against Arminianism, Enlightenment rationalism, and moralistic religion.
 - As an **exegetical/homiletical model** for revival preaching that links doctrine (decrees, wrath) with urgent pastoral appeal.
