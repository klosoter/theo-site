### TITLE
Typology in Biblical Theology - Peter J. Gentry (essay, The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology (evangelical, Southern Baptist Theological Seminary milieu), late 20th-early 21st century context of renewed interest in redemptive-historical and covenantal biblical theology.
 - Part of a wider recovery of typological method among Reformed and evangelical scholars reacting to both historic allegory and modern dispensational fragmentations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Typology is a biblically warranted, covenantally structured, Christ-centered hermeneutical category: historical persons/events in redemptive history are instituted by God as **real types** that find their true meaning and consummation in Christ (the antitype).
 - The problem addressed: how to distinguish legitimate biblical typology from speculative allegory or mere literary resemblance, and how typology functions within a canonical, covenantal framework.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition and safeguards
 - Types are historical realities embedded in redemptive history, not mere analogies or later ecclesial readings.
 - Legitimate typology requires divine intent or canonical sanction (e.g., New Testament interpretation that identifies fulfillment).
 - Hermeneutical criteria
 - Historicity, divine institution, internal patterning, and explicit or implicit New Testament fulfillment.
 - Theological function
 - Typology organizes Scripture christologically: OT events/patterns instantiate covenant promises that Christ fulfills, recapitulates, or completes.
 - Canonical exemplars
 - Paul and Hebrews as paradigmatic interpreters (Adam/Messiah, Moses/Christ, sacrifices/atonement, temple/eschatology).
 - Methodological caution
 - Rejects both naïve allegory and reductionist literalism; promotes disciplined, intertextual canonical reading.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament interpretive practice (esp. Paul, Hebrews).
 - Dialogues implicitly with Vosian/Geerhardus Vos tradition, redemptive-historical writers, and critics of typology (allegorists, strict literalists).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: evangelical biblical theologians emphasizing covenant and kingdom themes.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (how God discloses plan through patterns), Covenant (typology as covenantal patterning), Christology (Christ as fulfillment/antitype), Soteriology and Sacrament (typology of sacrifice, temple, priesthood), Ecclesiology (church as continuation/participant in typological reality).

- **Closing line**
 - Typology, when disciplined by historicity and canonical warrant, is a theologically necessary means by which the Old Testament's covenantal pattern unveils and culminates in the Christ-centered fulfillment of redemptive history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **divine institution** and New Testament sanction as the test for legitimate typology.
 - Typology embedded within a **covenant/kingdom** framework rather than as isolated patterns or mere moral lessons.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects historic allegorical abuses (e.g., arbitrary Platonic-allegorical readings) by insisting on historical grounding and canonical linkage.
 - Contrasts with dispensational or purely typological-minimalist readings that either sever OT patterns from Christ or treat all resemblances as typological.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies typology as both **ontological** (real, instituted patterns) and **hermeneutical** (method for canonical interpretation), bridging a gap between historical fact and theological meaning.
 - Emphasizes **authoritative fulfillment** - typological status is not merely reader-imposed but often evidenced by NT interpretation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and Reformed circles as a concise defense of redemptive-historical typology; informs seminary hermeneutics, preaching, and biblical-theological curricula.
 - Helped shape subsequent treatments of typology that balance historical claims with canonical reading strategies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear, usable framework for identifying and employing typology without slipping into allegory.
 - Valuable for pastors and scholars as a bridge between exegetical rigor and theological synthesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Type**
 - A historical person, event, or institution instituted by God that prefigures a fuller reality in Christ.

- **Antitype**
 - The fulfillment or reality corresponding to the type, ultimately centered in Christ.

- **Divine institution**
 - The criterion that a type must be rooted in God's purposeful ordering of redemptive history.

- **Canonically sanctioned**
 - New Testament citation or thematic appropriation that authorizes typological reading.

- **Redemptive-historical**
 - Reading Scripture as a unified narrative of God's covenantal acts culminating in Christ.

- **Recapitulation**
 - Concept of Christ re-performing or summing up earlier covenantal patterns (e.g., Adam, Moses).

- **Fulfillment**
 - Theological completion or consummation of promises and patterns in Christ (not merely chronological succession).

- **Foreshadowing vs. allegory**
 - Foreshadowing: legitimate prefiguration tied to divine purpose; Allegory: free symbolic reading often untethered to historicity or canonical warrant.

- **Typological warrant**
 - Combined evidence (historicity, divine intention, NT confirmation) that justifies reading an OT element as a type.

- **Covenantal pattern**
 - Recurrent OT structures (promise, exile, deliverance, sacral institutions) that set the pattern for Christ's work.

- **Sacrificial typology**
 - OT sacrifices as types pointing to the atoning work of Christ.

- **Temple/ Priesthood typology**
 - Temple and priesthood practices as anticipatory institutions consummated in Christ and the church.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical/conservative accounts of typology and its safeguards.
- As an **exegetical model** in sermons and OT-NT studies to justify Christological readings when supported by canonical evidence.
- As a **polemic tool** against allegorical excess and against readings that detach typology from covenantal structure.
