### TITLE
What Computers Still Can't Do: A Critique Of Artificial Reason - Hubert L. Dreyfus (first ed. 1972; revised eds. 1992, 2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the wake of early AI optimism (1960s-70s) and the dominance of symbolic, rule‑based "cognitivist" programs (Newell & Simon).
 - Grounded in continental phenomenology (primarily Heidegger and Merleau‑Ponty) as a corrective to analytic/functional approaches to mind.
 - Not a theological work, but increasingly read in theological anthropology, ethics of technology, and pastoral theology for its account of embodied human understanding.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Human intelligence is essentially nonformal, embodied, and situation‑bound; it cannot be captured by formal symbol manipulation or rule‑based programs.** Computers, construed as syntactic processors, therefore cannot genuinely replicate human understanding, skill, or expertise.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis of the dominant AI assumption: mind = information processing of formal symbols (computationalism).
 - Phenomenological critique: real skill, perception, and intelligent coping rely on a tacit background, not explicit rules.
 - Empirical and conceptual illustrations: failure of rule‑based systems in real‑world contexts; examples from expert performance and everyday coping.
 - Proposal of alternative: **embodied, situated cognition**-intelligence arises from embodied engagement with a world shaped by culturally‑learned practices.
 - Supplemental: later revisions integrate empirical work on expertise and the Dreyfus-Dreyfus model of skill acquisition.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Allen Newell, Herbert A. Simon, proponents of symbolic AI, early cognitive science.
 - Philosophical resources: Martin Heidegger (Being‑in‑the‑World), Maurice Merleau‑Ponty (embodiment), Wittgenstein (rule‑following and forms of life).
 - Later cross‑references: critiques resonate with Searle's Chinese Room and subsequent embodied cognition literature.

- **Doctrines treated (theologically significant implications)**
 - **Theological anthropology:** implications for imago Dei (image as embodied, relational, nonmechanical).
 - **Epistemology and revelation:** contrasts propositional knowledge with tacit knowing-affects models of revealed knowledge and discipleship.
 - **Ecclesiology & sacramentality:** emphasis on embodied practices supports liturgical, incarnational accounts of communal knowing.
 - **Moral agency and personhood:** argues against reductive accounts that locate agency in rule‑following computation.
 - (Not directly addressing Trinity, Christology, covenant; it supplies conceptual resources relevant to those loci.)

- **Closing line**
 - Dreyfus insists that **human understanding is an embodied, backgrounded, practice‑oriented phenomenon** that resists reduction to formal algorithms - a corrective to any theological or philosophical program that would treat persons as mere information processors.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained application of **phenomenology** to critique computational theories.
 - Elevates **tacit knowledge** and **skillful coping** over explicit algorithmic description.
 - Emphasis on **situatedness**: intelligence emerges within a world of practical meaning shaped by tradition and practice.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Directly opposes Newell & Simon's symbol‑manipulation model and later computationalist theologies that analogize souls to software.
 - Offers an alternative to Searle/functionalism by focusing on **embodiment and background intentionality** rather than solely on semantics.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized use of "background" or "tacit context" in debates about cognition.
 - Applied the Dreyfus-Dreyfus skill‑acquisition stages to critique claims about expert systems.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and later embodied cognition movements.
 - In theology, adopted as a cautionary resource against reductionist, computational images of persons; used in ethics of AI and pastoral considerations.
 - Mixed reception among AI researchers (initial resistance; later embodied cognition research vindicates some points).

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective to reductionism-useful for theological anthropology, liturgical theology, and ethics of technology.
 - Pedagogically valuable: clarifies distinction between knowledge‑that and knowledge‑how; grounds pastoral practice in embodied formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Computationalism / Symbol‑processing**
 - The claim that cognition is rule‑governed manipulation of formal symbols; Dreyfus critiques its sufficiency for human thought.

- **Tacit knowledge (knowledge‑how)**
 - Nonpropositional know‑how embedded in practice; central to Dreyfus's rejection of purely formal accounts.

- **Background / situation**
 - The prereflective, context‑saturated field that makes intelligent action possible without explicit rules.

- **Embodiment / Being‑in‑the‑World**
 - Heideggerian/Merleau‑Pontian idea that cognition is rooted in bodily engagement with a meaningful world.

- **Skillful coping**
 - Fluid, nonconscious responsiveness characteristic of experts and ordinary agents; contrasted with rule‑following.

- **Dreyfus-Dreyfus model**
 - Five stages of skill acquisition (novice → expert) used to show limits of rule‑based automation.

- **Holistic understanding / gestalt perception**
 - Perception and understanding grasp wholes, not atomized symbol manipulations.

- **Situated cognition**
 - Intelligence depends on environment, practice, and cultural forms; opposes disembodied computation.

- **Rule‑following problem**
 - Wittgensteinian point: formal rules cannot determine interpretation in all cases-supporting Dreyfus's critique.

- **Background intentionality**
 - Intentionality that is preconceptual and embedded in bodily comportment.

- **Expert intuition**
 - Rapid, context‑sensitive judgment inaccessible to explicit algorithms.

- **Nonreductive humanism**
 - Theological/anthropological posture resisting reduction of persons to machines.

- **Plasticity and apprenticeship**
 - Emphasizes formation in practices over formal instruction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for embodied/situated cognition in theological anthropology and ethics of technology.
- As a **polemic** against computationalist models of soul, mind, and pastoral formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for arguing that sacramental, liturgical, and pastoral practices instantiate knowledge not reducible to propositions.
