### TITLE
K. Scott Oliphint, "Something Much Too Plain to Say": A Systematic Theological Analysis of Van Til's Trinitarian Theology (Westminster Theological Journal, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2001 in Westminster Theological Journal; situated within postwar Reformed apologetic debates about Cornelius Van Til (1895-1987).
 - Addresses intramural disputes among Van Tillians, classical Reformed theologians, and critics who charge Van Til with modalism or unorthodox Trinitarian language.
 - Moves at the intersection of systematic theology, doctrine of God (Trinity, simplicity), and apologology (presuppositional method).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Oliphint argues that Van Til's apparently anomalous "one-person" language must be read systematically: Van Til neither collapses the persons nor endorses classical modalism, but instead intends a corrective to anthropomorphic and individualistic misconstruals of Trinitarian personhood.
 - The problem addressed: how to articulate the persons of the Trinity without importing human individualized person-concepts or compromising divine simplicity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical groundwork: surveys Van Til's primary statements where he uses "one person" language and notes rhetorical contexts (polemic against rationalistic and sensationalist anthropomorphism).
 - Theological reconstruction: locates Van Til's language within commitments to divine simplicity, relational knowledge among the divine life, and the epistemological priority of revelation.
 - Polemical clarification: distinguishes Van Til's move from modalism by showing he affirms real interpersonal relations (e.g., relations of origin) while denying human-style numerical individuation of the divine persons.
 - Systematic implications: traces consequences for Trinitarian talk, Christology, and presuppositional apologetics (how God's triune self-disclosure governs knowledge claims).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Cornelius Van Til (primary texts and lectures).
 - Secondary/traditional interlocutors: Augustine and classical patristic formulations on persons and relations; modern critics and defenders within Reformed circles (implicit engagement with those who label Van Til modalist).
 - Methodological interlocution with themes in divine simplicity and the ECONOMIC vs IMMANENT Trinity debates.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), divine simplicity, persons and relations, revelation (epistemology), Christology in relation to personhood and incarnation, apologology (presuppositional method).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Oliphint reads Van Til as holding a rigorous Trinitarianism that insists the divine persons must be spoken of without uncritically importing human individualizing concepts; his "one-person" locution is corrective, not heterodox.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes Van Til's consistent appeal to divine simplicity and relationality as motives for his atypical formulations.
 - Highlights the epistemological priority of the Trinity in Van Til's thought: Trinitarian ontology governs correct theological language.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects popular imputations of modalism by showing Van Til's affirmation of real intradivine relations (contra simplistic readings).
 - Contrasts Van Til's anti-anthropomorphism with classical expositions that lean on human person-concepts without sufficient critique.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Reframes "one-person language" as a methodological caution: a terminological restraint aimed at preventing category-transfer from creature to Creator.
 - Clarifies distinct senses of "person" at stake: human-subjective individuation vs. relational subsistence in the divine life.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Has been influential among Van Tillians and Reformed theologians who seek a sober, systematic defense of Van Til against Cartesian or nominalist critiques.
 - Serves as a go-to article for seminarians and scholars needing a concise defense of Van Til's Trinitarian locutions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact hermeneutic key for reading Van Til: read rhetorical negations (e.g., "one person") as doctrinally constrained cautions.
 - Useful for teaching Trinitarian theology where analytic categories (person/individual) risk misleading students about divine life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-person language**
 - Van Til's occasional assertion used as a corrective to anthropomorphic individuation; Oliphint interprets it contextually, not as denial of three persons.

- **Person (divine vs human)**
 - Distinguishes human individualizing notion of person from the biblical/creedal relational subsistence of the divine persons.

- **Divine simplicity**
 - Central to Oliphint's reading: safeguards against composing God into separable parts when speaking of persons.

- **Relations of origin**
 - Affirmed as real descriptors of intra-Trinitarian relations (Father begets, Son is begotten, Spirit proceeds) - used to distinguish Van Til from modalism.

- **Immanent vs economic Trinity**
 - Oliphint reads Van Til as attentive to both but suspicious of language that collapses immanent realities into merely economic descriptions or vice versa.

- **Anthropomorphic projection**
 - The error Van Til seeks to avoid: importing creaturely conceptual schemes into God's inner life.

- **Presuppositional apologetics**
 - Background commitment: the Trinity as the necessary presupposition for coherent knowledge and Christian epistemology in Van Til's system.

- **Modalism**
 - Classical heresy alleged by critics; Oliphint argues Van Til's stance is distinct and non-modalistic.

- **Epistemological priority of revelation**
 - For Van Til (as read by Oliphint), correct Trinitarian language is governed by God's self-revelation, not by autonomous human conceptual schemes.

- **Relational subsistence**
 - Term used to describe how persons exist in their relations without numerical division.

- **Analogical knowledge**
 - Balancing term: human analogies are necessary but must be critically adjusted to avoid projection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for interpreting Van Til's Trinitarian commitments within systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic tool** to rebut charges of modalism or orthodox deviation leveled at Van Til.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Van Til's rhetoric: treat negational locutions as methodological cautions.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian ontology to presuppositional epistemology in Reformed theological curricula.
