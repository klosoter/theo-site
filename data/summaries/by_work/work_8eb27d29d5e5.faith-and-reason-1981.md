### TITLE
**Faith and Reason** (1981) - Richard Swinburne. 
Oxford: Oxford University Press. Analytical philosophical theology arguing for the rationality of theistic belief via probability theory and cumulative evidential argument.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1980s analytic philosophy of religion; reaction to logical positivism, rising interest in formal epistemology and philosophy of religion.
 - Positioned before Plantinga's later work on warrant (1983) but in dialogue with mid-20th-century evidentialist and Humean critiques.
- **Central thesis**
 - Religious belief, including belief in God, can be rationally warranted by evidence; faith and reason are compatible when one treats theistic claims probabilistically and cumulatively.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduces an evidential framework using probability theory to assess competing hypotheses about God and the universe.
 - Advances a cumulative-case method: multiple modest probabilistic arguments (cosmological, teleological, design, arguments from religious experience and miracles) combine to raise overall probability of theism.
 - Appeals to simplicity (Occam's Razor) and explanatory power as criteria for preferring theism over naturalistic hypotheses.
 - Considers objections: problem of evil, hiddenness, unreliability of religious experience, and responds within probabilistic terms.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Hume (especially on miracles and design), Kantian limits to reason, Russellian skepticism, J.L. Mackie on evil, and contemporary analytic epistemologists.
 - Draws selectively on Thomistic and classical apologetic resources but reframes them in probabilistic language.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and religious experience** as evidence for God; **miracles** are evaluated probabilistically; limited treatment of Trinitarian or Christological dogmatics (focus is epistemological rather than systematic theology).
 - Addresses implications for divine attributes (omniscience, omnipotence) insofar as they bear on evidential assessment and theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Faith and Reason centers on the claim that rational, evidence-sensitive belief in God is defensible: reason increases the credibility of faith when multiple modest evidences are combined under principled probabilistic rules.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic use of probability theory and a formalized cumulative-case approach to theism rather than single decisive proofs.
 - Stresses **simplicity** and explanatory scope as epistemic virtues favoring theism.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against strict fideism: insists faith must answer to evidence and reason. 
 - Against simple deductive proofs: rejects expectation of certainty and instead promotes graded rationality via probability.
 - Prepares a foil to Plantinga's Reformed Epistemology by defending evidentialist and probabilistic warrant rather than properly basic belief accounts.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Operationalizes classical apologetic moves within Bayesian-style reasoning (precise probabilistic language, though not always formal Bayesianism).
 - Treats diverse evidences (experience, design, cosmology, miracles) as accumulable probabilistic supports.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in analytic theology and contemporary apologetics; revitalized rationalist defense of theism in late 20th century.
 - Provoked sustained dialogue with epistemologists (notably Plantinga) and shaped curricula in philosophy of religion across confessional lines, including Reformed seminaries that value analytic methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear methodological template for bringing formal epistemology to theological claims; a durable teaching resource for debates on rationality of theism and evidential responses to scepticism and evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Probability / Probabilistic reasoning** - central epistemic tool for assessing comparative evidence for theism vs naturalism.
- **Cumulative case** - strategy of adding modest independent evidences to raise overall probability for God.
- **Simplicity (Occam's Razor)** - used as an evidential virtue; theism favored for explanatory simplicity of ultimate explanation.
- **Explanatory power** - a criterion for preferring theistic hypothesis when it accounts more comprehensively for diverse facts.
- **Religious experience** - treated as public-type evidence whose reliability can be assessed probabilistically.
- **Miracles** - evaluated as probabilistic events; credibility judged by antecedent probability and testimonial reliability.
- **Theodicy / Problem of evil** - acknowledged as a significant defeater but argued to be addressable within a probabilistic framework (see use below).
- **Divine knowability / hiddenness** - discussed in relation to evidential strength: the degree to which God's existence is likely given available evidence.
- **Epistemic standards / evidence-sensitivity** - insistence that belief should respond to evidence gradients rather than demand certainty.
- **Naturalism vs Theism** - comparative hypothesis testing forms the argumentative backbone.
- **Use across loci**
 - Theodicy And Divine Justice: Swinburne's probabilistic framing is used to assess the force of evil as defeat or reduction of probability for theism and to model defenses that retain theism's explanatory plausibility in light of suffering.
 - Existence And Knowability Of God: Commonly cited as a principal analytic defense of God's existence and knowability; used as a methodological exemplar for cumulative/probabilistic apologetics and for grounding the epistemic rationality of theistic belief.
