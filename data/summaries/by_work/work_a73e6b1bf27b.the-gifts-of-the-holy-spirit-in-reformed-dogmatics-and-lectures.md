### TITLE
**Geerhardus Vos - "The Gifts of the Holy Spirit" (lectures / Reformed Dogmatics material)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton/Reformed milieu; Vos as leading Biblical-theologian at Princeton Seminary, writing within the Reformed dogmatic tradition and biblical-theological method.
 - Material derives from Vos's dogmatic lectures and shorter treatments on pneumatology and ecclesial life; addresses modern questions about miracles, charismatic phenomena, and the relation of Spirit-gifts to sanctification.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To situate the varied "gifts of the Spirit" within a coherent Reformed pneumatology that preserves both the sovereignty and continuity of the Spirit's sanctifying work and the church's normative reliance on Word and sacraments.
 - Problem addressed: how to differentiate permanent, normative operations of the Spirit in sanctification from extraordinary, time-bound charisms; and how to guard ecclesial order and doctrine from unstable claims to revelation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Preliminary: explication of the Holy Spirit's place in Trinitarian economy and covenant life.
 - Distinction: **ordinary/ common grace and sanctifying gifts** vs **extraordinary/charismatic gifts** (for apostolic witness and church edification in special seasons).
 - Function: gifts are instruments of the Spirit's work in building Christ's body - illumining, sanctifying, and enabling ministry - but are subordinated to the objective means of grace (Word and sacraments).
 - Historical-theological demonstration: tracing how early church offices and gifts served revelation and canon formation; reviewing patristic and Reformation treatments to show normative cessation of revelatory office after apostolic era.
 - Practical-theological conclusion: pastoral criteria for discerning gifts and shaping church order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly or explicitly: Calvin and Reformed scholastics (office and sacraments), patristic witness on prophecy and apostleship, contemporary Princeton colleagues (e.g., B. B. Warfield on miracles), and modern charismatic claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (indwelling vs extraordinary agency), ecclesiology (offices, order), revelation (canon and extraordinary gifts), sanctification (means and progress), covenant theology (Spirit's role in covenant life), Christology (Spirit as mediator of Christ's life in believers).
- **Closing line**
 - Vos centers the discussion on a disciplined Reformed conviction: the Spirit sovereignly equips the church for sanctification and mission, but gifts must be interpreted through canon, covenant, and ecclesial order so that sanctification remains rooted in Word and sacrament.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of gifts into a historical-covenantal framework: gifts are not isolated phenomena but moments within the progressive revelation and covenantal life of the church.
 - Careful typology of Spirit-activity: consistently contrasts habitual sanctifying operations with extraordinary revelatory or revelatory-adjacent gifts.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects radical continuationist tendencies by stressing the time-bound function of certain charismatic offices (apostles, foundational prophecy) tied to revelation and canon formation.
 - Distinguishes from reductive cessationism by acknowledging the ongoing reality of spiritual gifts for edification, while restraining claims to ongoing canonical revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on **organic** development: gifts are functions within the living organism of the covenant community rather than discrete private powers.
 - Uses covenantal categories to adjudicate charismatic claims (e.g., gifts as covenantal means vs. individual experiential marks).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed scholars for providing a middle course between caricatured cessationism and uncritical charismatic enthusiasm.
 - Frequently cited in Reformed treatments of pneumatology and ecclesiology as a model that ties biblical theology into systematic conclusions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined hermeneutic and pastoral grid for churches facing charismatic claims; valuable for teaching chronological and functional distinctions that preserve doctrine and pastoral order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gifts of the Spirit**
 - Broadly: all Spirit-bestowed abilities and graces; Vos distinguishes functional subcategories (sanctifying vs extraordinary).
- **Ordinary/ common grace**
 - The habitual, ongoing operations of the Spirit that accompany justification and sanctification (illumination, sanctifying power).
- **Extraordinary/charismatic gifts**
 - Gifts tied to apostolic foundation or special church needs (prophecy, apostolic authority, tongues in early church context); often time-bound.
- **Sanctification**
 - The Spirit-mediated progressive conformity to Christ through means of grace; primary sphere for ordinary gifts.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Study of the Spirit; Vos emphasizes relational, covenantal activity rather than isolated phenomena.
- **Means of grace**
 - Word and sacraments as normative channels of Spirit work; gifts must be subordinate to these.
- **Covenant**
 - Framework for locating gifts: gifts function within covenant life and redemptive-historical development.
- **Revelation & Canon**
 - Distinguishes revelatory gifts that aided canonical formation from ordinary gifts that do not add to Scripture.
- **Ecclesial office**
 - Offices (apostle, prophet, pastor) treated as mediated forms of gifts; Vos stresses historical completion of foundational offices.
- **Organic development**
 - Term for how gifts and offices unfold within the living covenant community over time.
- **Illumination**
 - Spirit's work enabling understanding and application of Scripture; key for sanctification.
- **Ministerial/charismatic distinction**
 - Differentiates regular ministerial empowerment from non-official charismatic manifestations.
- **Cessationism (qualified)**
 - Vos often functions as a qualified cessationist: some revelatory gifts cease with foundation of church, while other gifts continue.
- **Edification**
 - Primary telos of gifts - building up the body in holiness and truth.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **doctrinal definition source** for careful Reformed pneumatology and distinctions of gift-types.
 - As a **polemic and pastoral model** against both excesses of charismatic sensationalism and brittle denial of Spirit-activity; serves as an **exegetical-model** for reading NT gift-passages within covenant history.
