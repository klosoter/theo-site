### TITLE
**"Revelation" - B. B. Warfield (International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, 1915)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Article written by B. B. Warfield, leading conservative Princeton theologian, for the ISBE (first ed., 1915).
 - Situated in early-20th-century Reformed evangelical response to historical-critical scholarship, liberal theology, and rising dispensational/esoteric eschatologies.
 - Warfield writes as systematic and pastoral theologian defending orthodox doctrines of Scripture and prophetic faithfulness.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Revelation is God's objective, propositional self-disclosure culminating in Christ and attested in Scripture; challenges include modern skepticism about supernatural revelation and the problem of the apparent delay of the Parousia (Second Coming).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and delimitation: distinguishes revelation as act (God's revealing) and as content (the revelata) with emphasis on propositional truth.
 - Modes and media: treats general vs. special revelation, prophecy, typology, and canonical Scripture as the normative repository of revelation.
 - Authority and inspiration: defends Scripture's divine authorship and reliability (verbal-plenary emphases implicit in Warfield's wider corpus).
 - Eschatological issue: addresses the Delay of the Parousia as theologically explicable - God's patience and purpose in salvation history rather than failure of promise.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: revelation governs doctrine, worship, and mission; the delay summons ethical readiness, evangelistic urgency, and faithful church order.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: historical-critical critics (e.g., modernist exegesis), popular dispensational and sensational eschatologies.
 - Uses Scripture, patristic testimony, Reformation (Calvinian) tradition, and contemporary conservative scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general/special), inspiration, canon, prophecy, Christology (Christ as center of revelation), eschatology (Parousia, Delay), ecclesiology (normative role of Scripture).

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's piece centers on revelation as a divinely authoritative, propositional disclosure culminating in Christ and preserved in Scripture, with the Delay of the Parousia read theologically as God's patient providence rather than a doctrinal collapse.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses the propositional and objective character of revelation over purely mystical or subjective forms.
 - Treats the Delay of the Parousia as providential: delay is purposive, not accidental - an ethical and soteriological economy rather than doctrinal embarrassment.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal readings that reduce revelation to human religious experience or myth.
 - Counters sensationalist dispensational futurisms that make eschatology speculative rather than scripturally disciplined.
 - Reasserts classical Reformed confidence in canonical authority against relativizing modern criticism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies technical distinction between the act of revelation and the revelatory content; insists on propositional content as legitimate theological locus.
 - Integrates discussion of delay (a usually narrow eschatological topic) into a broader doctrine of revelation and divine purpose.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in conservative Reformed circles and handbooks as a concise, reliable statement of revelation doctrine.
 - Used as an authoritative popular-scholarly summary in early 20th-century evangelical defenses of inerrancy and orthodox eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact model for treating revelation that ties hermeneutics, doctrine of Scripture, and eschatology together.
 - Valuable for students who need a defensible, theologically integrated response to the Delay of the Parousia and to modern critical pressures.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (act vs. content)** - Warfield distinguishes God's revealing activity from the propositional content revealed.
- **Special revelation** - Revelation in Scripture and in Christ as distinct from general revelation in nature/conscience.
- **General revelation** - Natural knowledge of God (but insufficient for salvation without special revelation).
- **Inspiration** - Divine authorship/trustworthiness of Scripture; implicit verbal-plenary approach.
- **Canon** - Scripture as the normative corpus preserving revelation; authoritative for doctrine and life.
- **Prophecy** - Foretelling and forth-telling as vehicles of revelation; closely tied to fulfillment in Christ.
- **Apocalyptic language** - Genre markers requiring theological, not merely literalist, interpretation.
- **Parousia (Second Coming)** - Eschatological consummation; doctrinal center for hope and judgment.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - Theologically explained as God's patience and mission-oriented providence, not divine failure.
 - Sub-note: uses Scripture (e.g., apostolic reassurances) to defuse pastoral anxiety and call to ethical vigilance.
- **Authority** - Revelation grounds ecclesial and doctrinal authority; resists relativistic or purely experiential claims.
- **Fulfillment** - Old Testament promises fulfilled in Christ; hermeneutic key for prophecy and typology.
- **Patience of God** - Central telos in explanation of delay; ties eschatology to soteriology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for revelation and its canonical grounding in conservative Reformed teaching.
 - As a **polemic** against modernist reductions of revelation and against speculative eschatologies that mishandle the Delay of the Parousia.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** linking prophecy, fulfillment, and ethical consequences for church belief and practice.
