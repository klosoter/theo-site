### TITLE
The Defense of the Faith, Cornelius Van Til (1st ed. 1955; rev. eds.), Westminster Theological Seminary, Reformed presuppositional apologetics

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed resurgence at Westminster Seminary (Kuyper-Bavinck line), amid fundamentalist-modernist fallout and the rise of neo-orthodoxy.
 - Interlocutors include Thomist natural theology, evidentialist apologetics, and modern philosophy from Hume to Kant to Idealism.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Only the self-attesting triune God of Scripture provides the necessary precondition for intelligible knowledge.** Apologetics must be **covenantal** and **presuppositional**, refusing neutrality and exposing the **impossibility of the contrary**.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Establish a **Creator-creature distinction**: all human knowledge is **analogical**, dependent, and covenantal.
 - Deny epistemic **autonomy** and the supposed **neutral common ground**; insist on a point of contact via **general revelation and common grace**, not shared neutrality.
 - Advance a **transcendental argument**: show that logic, science, morality, and unity-in-diversity presuppose the **ontological Trinity**.
 - Defend **virtuous circularity**: every ultimate authority is self-referential; Christian circularity is warranted by divine revelation.
 - Contrast Christian theism with rival systems (empiricism, rationalism, idealism, Roman Catholic synthesis, Barthian dialectic) and show their internal instability.
 - Integrate apologetics with **Reformed dogmatics**: Scripture self-authenticating; noetic effects of sin; regeneration and the Spirit as epistemic renewal; Christ as Lord of knowledge; church as witnessing covenant community; eschatological certainty over probabilism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: **Calvin, Augustine, Kuyper, Bavinck**.
 - Critically: **Aquinas and Thomism**, **Butler and evidentialism**, **Warfield** on method, **Kant, Hume, Hegel**, **Barth and Brunner**, **Gordon Clark** on rationalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation**: general vs special; rejection of autonomous natural theology.
 - **Bibliology**: **self-attesting Scripture**, inerrant, final authority.
 - **Theology proper and Trinity**: solution to the one-and-many; ground of coherence.
 - **Anthropology and sin**: **noetic effects**, antithesis, suppression of truth.
 - **Soteriology**: **regeneration** as epistemic and moral renewal; Spirit's testimony.
 - **Christology**: Christ as mediator of revelation and Lord of all reasoning.
 - **Covenant theology**: knowledge is covenantal; point of contact through common grace.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: church bears corporate witness; confession and sacramental life shape epistemic posture.
 - **Eschatology**: certainty rests in God's promise and providence, not probability.
- **Closing line**
 - The book centers on this claim: **Apologetics is evangelical submission of all thought to the self-attesting triune God of Scripture, showing that without Him nothing is intelligible.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Analogical knowledge** under the **Creator-creature distinction**.
 - **Antithesis** and **common grace** held together without neutrality.
 - **Transcendental proof** for Christian theism; **impossibility of the contrary**.
 - **Virtuous circularity** of ultimate authority and **self-authenticating Scripture**.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against **Thomist natural theology** and **probabilist evidentialism**: affirms natural revelation but denies autonomy.
 - Against **Barthian** dialectic: insists on cognitive, propositional, historical revelation and a real fall.
 - Against **rationalism** and **empiricism**: exposes their borrowed capital and one-many failures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Presuppositional** or **covenantal** apologetics; **point of contact** via revelation and common grace; **epistemological self-consciousness**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Westminster tradition and successors (**Bahnsen, Frame, Oliphint**).
 - Sharply debated by classical apologists (e.g., **Sproul, Gerstner, Lindsley**); shaped Reformed prolegomena and worldview pedagogy.
- **Enduring value**
 - Integrates apologetics with Reformed systematics; equips the church to resist neutrality; frames evangelism as intellectual and moral repentance before Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creator-creature distinction**: God is self-sufficient; human knowledge is dependent and analogical.
- **Analogical knowledge**: we think God's thoughts after Him, truly though not exhaustively.
- **Presuppositional apologetics**: starting from revealed Lordship of Christ rather than neutral reason.
- **Covenantal method**: epistemology situated within covenant obedience or rebellion.
- **Antithesis**: moral-spiritual opposition between belief and unbelief due to sin.
- **Common grace**: restrains sin, provides a **point of contact** without granting neutrality.
 - Distinguish from the claim of shared autonomous principles.
- **Transcendental argument (TAG)**: shows preconditions of intelligibility are uniquely Christian-theistic.
- **Self-attesting Scripture**: the Bible bears divine authority intrinsically; the Spirit confirms.
 - Contrasts with placing an external criterion over Scripture.
- **Impossibility of the contrary**: non-Christian systems undermine the very tools they employ.
- **Virtuous circularity**: every ultimate authority reasons circularly; Christian circle is warranted by God.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: sin corrupts reasoning and interpretation, not merely behavior.
- **One and many problem**: only the **ontological Trinity** grounds unity-in-diversity.
- **Autonomy vs authority**: rejection of man as final judge; submission to Christ's lordship in thought.
- **Christian-theistic proof**: cumulative-transcendental case that Christianity alone makes reason, science, and morality possible.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Prolegomena and Bibliology**: defines self-authentication and the epistemic role of Scripture and Spirit.
 - **Theology proper and Trinity**: employs Trinity to resolve one-many and ground rationality.
 - **Soteriology and Christology**: ties regeneration and Christ's lordship to the renewal of mind.
 - **Covenant, Ecclesiology, Eschatology**: frames knowledge as covenantal, corporate witness now, with eschatological certainty rather than probabilism.
