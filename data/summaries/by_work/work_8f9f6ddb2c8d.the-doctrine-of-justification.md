### TITLE
The Doctrine of Justification - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical Reformed scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century).
 - Written amid renewed controversy over Pauline theology sparked by the New Perspective on Paul (NPP: Sanders, Dunn, Wright).
 - Aimed at pastors, students, and scholars defending classical Protestant formulations (Reformation confessions, Westminster, etc.).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Justification is primarily a forensic, declarative act of God: sinners are pronounced righteous on the basis of Christ's righteousness and received by faith alone.
 - The book diagnoses attempts to recast justification as merely covenantal membership or ethical status (NPP) and defends the Reformation insight that justification is the gospel's central legal verdict.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Careful exegesis of key Pauline and Johannine texts (esp. Romans and Galatians) to establish the forensic sense of divine reckoning.
 - Historical-theological survey of patristic, medieval, and Reformation understandings to show continuity/contrast.
 - Systematic synthesis: relation of justification to union with Christ, imputation, sanctification, adoption, and atonement theology.
 - Polemical engagement with the NPP and Roman Catholic soteriology:
 - Rebuttal of covenantal nomism and the claim that "works of the law" are ethnic boundary markers only.
 - Defense of sola fide and imputation against merit-based or infused-righteousness models.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Augustine, Luther, Calvin, Reformation confessions, Westminster divines.
 - Contemporary: E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright, and Roman Catholic critics; proponents of forensic and penal substitution models (e.g., John Murray).
 - Biblical authors: Paul (esp. Romans, Galatians), Genesis/OT covenant background, and occasional Johannine references.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, adoption).
 - Christology (atonement and active/passive obedience of Christ).
 - Covenant theology (role of covenant in justification debate).
 - Implications for ecclesiology and assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - Schreiner locates the heart of the gospel in God's forensic declaration of righteousness through Christ, received by faith alone and rooted in union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong coupling of **forensic justification** with **union with Christ**: imputation is grounded in real union rather than merely legal fiction.
 - Clear insistence that justification and sanctification are distinct yet inseparable in experience and order.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects the NPP by arguing that Paul's language frequently entails legal reckoning, not merely covenantal membership or covenant faithfulness.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholic tradition by defending imputed righteousness against infused/merited righteousness.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "declarative forensic language" across Pauline texts and insists on careful semantic-historical exegesis to avoid conflating covenant language with ontological infusion.
 - Nuanced use of "righteousness of God" as both God's covenant faithfulness and the righteousness credited to the believer.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a clear, accessible defense of classical justification.
 - Frequently cited in debates over the New Perspective and in pastoral/theological training on soteriology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Effective exemplar of integrating close exegesis, historical theology, and systematic coherence.
 - Useful as a teaching text that models how to defend traditional doctrines against modern reinterpretations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - God's forensic declaration that the sinner is righteous on account of Christ.
- **Imputation**
 - Christ's righteousness reckoned to the believer; believer's sin reckoned to Christ in his atoning work.
- **Forensic/forensic declaration**
 - Legal language emphasizing verdict, not inner moral transformation.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Ontological ground for benefits (justification, sanctification, adoption); explains how imputation is not merely legal fiction.
- **Sola fide (faith alone)**
 - Faith as instrument by which the believer receives the forensic verdict; excludes earning merit by works.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive transformation distinct from justification but inseparably related in the believer's life.
- **Penal substitution**
 - Emphasized model of atonement: Christ bears the penalty of sin, enabling God's righteous justification of sinners.
- **Works of the law**
 - Paul's contested phrase; Schreiner argues it includes legalistic attempts to earn righteousness, not only boundary markers.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Contemporary position critiqued for minimizing forensic aspects of Paul's soteriology.
- **Covenantal nomism**
 - NPP-associated idea that covenant, not legal condemnation, frames Paul's concerns; Schreiner engages and qualifies this.
- **Righteousness of God**
 - Ambiguous phrase clarified in terms of both divine faithfulness and credited righteousness.
- **Active/passive obedience**
 - Christ's perfect obedience (active) and suffering for sin (passive) as grounds for justification.
- **Assurance**
 - Pastoral implication: assurance grounded in declared status in Christ, not subjective moral performance.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definitional source** for classical Protestant doctrine of justification in classroom and pulpit.
 - As a **polemic** and exegetical counterweight to the New Perspective on Paul.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline soteriology with theological application.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula integrating biblical exegesis, historical theology, and systematic soteriology.
