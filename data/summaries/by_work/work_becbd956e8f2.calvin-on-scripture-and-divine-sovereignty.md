### TITLE
Calvin on Scripture and Divine Sovereignty - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholarly recovery of Calvin; written against rising liberal and modernist readings that downplay Calvin's theological coherence.
 - Murray writes as a confessional Presbyterian theologian aiming to show Calvin's systematic integrity in biblically grounded Reformed theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin's doctrine of Scripture and his doctrine of divine sovereignty are not parallel themes but mutually constitutive: Scripture is the authoritative instrument and witness of God's sovereign rule, and Divine sovereignty provides the hermeneutical horizon within which Scripture is to be read and applied.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological reconstruction of Calvin's teaching on Scripture (authority, inspiration, clarity, accommodation).
 - Systematic exposition of divine sovereignty in Calvin (decree, providence, predestination, reprobation) and how it coheres with biblical revelation.
 - Polemic moves against views that bifurcate God's decree from God's revealed Word (e.g., rationalist or pietistic reductions).
 - Practical and pastoral implications: assurance, preaching, and the use of means under providence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries, sermons).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Augustine (as Calvin's patristic interlocutor), contemporary critics (liberal scholarship, emerging Arminian readings), Roman Catholic and Lutheran contrasts where relevant.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, authority, perspicuity, accommodation).
 - Divine sovereignty (decree, providence, predestination, reprobation), human responsibility and inability.
 - Soteriology and assurance (union with Christ, sanctification as fruit).
 - Practical theology: preaching, sacraments as means under sovereignty.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - For Murray, Calvin's theology holds that God's absolute sovereignty and the perspicuous, divine authorship of Scripture form a single theological axis: Scripture is God's appointed instrument to enact and to assure the effects of his sovereign will.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats Calvin's bibliology and doctrine of sovereignty as an integrated theological system rather than discrete topics.
 - Stresses Calvin's consistent appeal to Scripture as the normative criterion for understanding God's sovereign acts.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects readings that portray Calvin as fatalistic or irrationally deterministic by showing Calvin's sustained concern for means, responsibility, and pastoral care.
 - Contrasts Calvin's biblicism with Enlightenment reductions (which secularize sovereignty) and with Roman Catholic appeals to tradition as competing authorities.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies Calvin's use of "accommodation" and "perspicuity" to counter charges that Calvin privatizes revelation or surrenders intelligibility.
 - Reframes Calvin's account of providence as compatible with genuine human agency (a compatibilist realism rather than simple determinism).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed theologians and seminaries as a careful corrective to revisionist Calvin studies.
 - Used in debates on inerrancy, divine sovereignty, and pastoral assurance; cited in treatments of Calvinian providence and ethics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a tightly argued, textually attentive synthesis that makes Calvin accessible as a coherent theological voice on Bible and sovereignty.
 - Serves as a reliable bridge between historical theology (Calvin studies) and systematic concerns in contemporary Reformed doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture as Word of God** - Scripture's propositional authority; not merely religious maxim but divine self-communication.
- **Inspiration (verbal/organic)** - Murray reads Calvin as insisting on divine agency in Scripture without collapsing human authorship.
- **Perspicuity** - The Bible's essential clarity for salvation; Calvin's pastoral confidence in preaching and catechesis.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescending mode of revelation so that finite minds may apprehend divine truth; Murray defends its doctrinal limits.
- **Authority and sufficiency** - Scripture as the final norm for doctrine and life; adequate for faith and practice.
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's absolute rule over decree and providence; all events are under God's governance.
- **Providence** - God's governance through means; Murray emphasizes Calvin's attention to secondary causes and human responsibility.
- **Predestination / Reprobation** - Calvin's formulation of eternal election and non-election; treated as consistent with God's justice and goodness.
- **Human inability (Total Inability)** - Calvin's anthropology: sin wounds the will so that divine initiation is necessary; Murray uses this to explicate Calvin on regeneration.
- **Total Depravity** - Human corruption of all faculties; explains the need for sovereign grace (linked to Murray's site usage on human inability).
- **Theodicy** - Defense of God's justice in permitting evil; Murray traces Calvin's appeal to mystery, divine wisdom, and the cross (linked to site usage on divine justice).
- **Divine justice** - God's righteousness in decree and judgment; Calvin's balance of justice and mercy underlies his doctrine of providence.
- **Means/mediation** - Emphasizes Calvin's practice of God working through ordinances, word, and sacraments.
- **Assurance** - Pastoral fruit of Gospel proclaimed under sovereign grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Calvinian bibliology and a concise statement of how Scripture functions in Reformed theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against soft determinism, secularized sovereignty, and anti-inspiration critiques.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Calvin: close textual engagement, theological synthesis, and pastoral correlation.
