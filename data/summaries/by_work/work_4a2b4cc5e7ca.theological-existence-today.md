### TITLE
Theological Existence Today! - Karl Barth

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early-to-mid 20th century, the formative period of **neo-orthodoxy** (post-WWI Europe; theological reaction to liberal Protestant accommodation and the politicization of the churches during the Weimar and early Nazi eras). 
 - Barth writing as part of a corrective movement against theological liberalism and cultural Christianity; intersects with Confessing Church debates about Church and State relations.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Christian existence today must be determined by the self-revelation of God in Jesus Christ rather than by human experience, culture, or state ideology. The Church's theological existence is essentially a **witnessing existence** under the Word of God, resisting any fusion with secular power.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Theology begins with **revelation**, not religious feeling or natural reason. 
 - The Word of God is an event that **interrupts** and judges human existence; Christian existence is a decision in relation to that event. 
 - The Church exists to **confess** and witness to Christ's lordship; it must refuse theological compromises that domesticate the Gospel to state interests. 
 - Practical corollary: Church-State relations must be ordered by the priority of God's sovereignty and the Church's prophetic vocation, not by subordination to political aims.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Implicitly and explicitly in dialogue with **Friedrich Schleiermacher**, the Ritschlian school, liberal Protestantism, and contemporary political theologians; also in polemic with any form of natural theology and cultural Christianity. 
 - Internal interlocutors: later debates with Emil Brunner and others over natural theology and the status of reason.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation/Word of God**, Christology (centered on the event of Christ), ecclesiology (the Church's witnessing existence), soteriology (decision/election dimensions), and ethical-political implications (Church & State relations).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 - Christian existence today is defined by the decisive, disruptive self-revelation of God in Christ; the Church's authentic existence is prophetic witness and confession, opposing any idolatrous identification with the state.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Theology as an interruption of human pretensions: the Word is an event that judges culture rather than being assimilated to it. 
 - Theological existence framed as **decision and confession** rather than development of religious consciousness.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Rejects Schleiermacher's grounding of religion in feeling and the liberal attempt to harmonize Gospel with modern culture. 
 - Opposes natural theology and any claim that there is a neutral rational bridge between God and human institutions (including the state).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Strong articulation of the **event-character** of revelation; emphasis on **dialectical** relation (God-to-human, judgment-to-promised reconciliation) rather than continuity. 
 - Reframing ecclesial identity as theological existence - a public, confessing stance rather than merely an inward spiritual condition.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Instrumental in shaping **neo-orthodoxy**, the Confessing Church, and the Barmen Declaration's resistance to state cooptation. Provoked sustained critique (notably Brunner) about the role of reason and natural revelation. Influenced later political-theological reflection (e.g., Bonhoeffer, Moltmann).
- **Enduring value:** 
 - A robust corrective to ecclesial accommodation and an enduring resource for theological ethics and Church-State critique; valuable methodologically as a challenge to theology's cultural capitulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God (Wort Gottes):** Revelation as an event; normative for theology and ecclesial existence. 
- **Revelation:** Not data added to human knowing but divine self‑address that demands decision. 
- **Decision:** Existential response of the Church/person to the revelation-event; decisive, not gradual. 
- **Dialectical theology:** Mode emphasizing the tension/contradiction between God's transcendence and human existence. 
- **Christocentricism:** Christ as the decisive center where God's revelation and judgment meet. 
- **Election:** God's choosing as the basis for the Church's distinct identity and vocation. 
- **Rejection of natural theology (analogia entis):** No autonomous theological foothold in human nature or state ideology. 
- **Confession:** The Church's public, verbal witness; ecclesial existence is confession under the Word. 
- **Prophetic witness:** The Church's vocation to critique and correct political powers that claim ultimate authority. 
- **Sovereignty of God / Lordship of Christ:** The theological ground for resisting state idolatry and ordering Church-State relations. 
- **Theological existence:** Barth's label for the Church's being defined by revelation and witness, not by sociological measures. 
- **State/church distinction (applied):** While Christ rules all, the Church must not become an apparatus of state power; rather it acts prophetically.
- **Uses across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for neo-orthodox method: revelation-first, Christ-centered theology. 
 - As a **polemic** against theological liberalism and any theological domestication by the state. 
 - As a **model for ecclesiology and political ethics**: helps craft a theology of resistance and prophetic witness in contexts of oppressive or idolatrous regimes.
