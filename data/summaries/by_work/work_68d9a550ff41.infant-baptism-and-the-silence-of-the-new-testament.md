### TITLE
Infant Baptism and the Silence of the New Testament - Bryan Holstrom

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed/evangelical theological conversation; aimed at debates between paedobaptist (Reformed) and credobaptist (Baptist) traditions.
 - Situated against late 20th/early 21st century biblical-theological and confessional defenses of infant baptism; interacts with both historical tradition and current NT scholarship on household baptisms.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The absence of explicit New Testament statements about infant baptism (the "silence") does not decisively rule out infant baptism; proper hermeneutical and covenantal reading of Scripture supports the practice.
 - The theological problem is how to interpret silence: as negative evidence against paedobaptism or as interpretive space governed by covenant theology and typological continuity.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: lays out the debate and articulates what "silence" means practically and exegetically.
 - Exegetical survey: examines household baptisms (Acts and Pauline letters), texts appealed to by credobaptists (e.g., Mark 16:16; Acts 2; household lists), and the absence of explicit infant reference.
 - Theological-principled response:
 - Invokes **covenant continuity**: the sign of circumcision in the old covenant and baptism in the new are functionally parallel; children in the covenant household remain included.
 - Treats baptism as **sign and seal** of the covenant, not merely a testimony to personal faith; thus household baptism plausibly includes covenant children.
 - Argues for a hermeneutic where silence is evaluated by analogy of faith, historical practice, and the logic of corporate covenant identity.
 - Methodological claim: Scripture's silence requires a disciplined interpretive default rather than a libertarian inference; ecclesial practice and confessional tradition are legitimate aids.
 - Practical implications: ecclesiology, admission to covenant community, pastoral administration of baptism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with Reformed confessional sources (Westminster/Calvinist lineage) and contemporary credobaptist critiques.
 - Dialogues with NT exegetical literature on household baptisms and sacramental theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (silence and interpretive authority), covenant theology (continuity and children), sacramentology (sign and seal, efficacy), ecclesiology (church membership and initiation), typology (circumcision/baptism).

- **Closing line**
 - Holstrom positions infant baptism as theologically coherent within a covenantal, typological reading of Scripture and argues that New Testament silence, properly interpreted, supports presumption in favor of covenantal inclusion of children.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Stresses a formal hermeneutic for handling silence: silence is not neutral; it must be read through covenantal categories and the analogy of faith.
 - Presents household baptisms as theologically saturated loci, not merely incidental data points.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters credobaptist appeals to silence as decisive by offering principled reasons why ecclesial practice and covenant logic fill gaps.
 - Refines older paedobaptist defenses by giving more rigorous methodological criteria rather than appeals to tradition alone.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames "silence" as an exegetical problem requiring a presumption (not a burden) toward covenant inclusion - a calibrated presumption rather than an a priori claim.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but focused reception within Reformed circles as a clear, compact resource defending paedobaptism against arguments from silence.
 - Cited in discussions that weigh exegetical data against confessional theology; used more as a teaching and polemical resource than as a major academic monograph.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for clarifying hermeneutical stakes when Scripture is silent on a practice; useful in pastoral and catechetical contexts for explaining why Reformed churches baptize infants.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Silence of Scripture** - the descriptive lack of explicit NT statements about infant baptism and the hermeneutical question that silence raises.
- **Household baptisms** - Acts and Pauline references to baptisms of entire households taken as primary data for inclusion of children.
- **Covenant continuity** - the thesis that the covenant of grace bridges Old and New Testaments, carrying implications for signs and members.
- **Sign and seal** - classic Reformed language for sacraments; baptism functions as covenantal sign parallel to circumcision.
- **Paedobaptism** - infant baptism; defended here on covenantal and ecclesiological grounds.
- **Credobaptism** - believer's baptism; represented as the rival position that treats silence as decisive.
- **Analogy of faith** - interpretive principle used to read ambiguous texts in light of whole-Scripture theology.
- **Typology (circumcision/baptism)** - conceptual link tying OT child inclusion under circumcision to NT baptismal practice.
- **Ecclesial initiation** - baptism as the rite of admission to covenant community, including children in paedobaptist framing.
- **Presumptive inclusion** - methodological posture advocated: where Scripture is silent, default to covenantal inclusion of children.
- **Revelational gaps** - areas where Scripture does not resolve practical detail, requiring principled interpretive response.
- **Sacramental efficacy** - discussion of what baptism effects and whether infants can be subjects of sacramental sign/benefit.
- **Household paradigm** - using household lists as paradigmatic data for community composition.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** clarifying what is meant by "silence" and "presumptive inclusion."
 - As **polemic** against credobaptist appeals to silence; supplies method and argumentation for defenders of infant baptism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading household baptisms within covenant theology and ecclesiology.
