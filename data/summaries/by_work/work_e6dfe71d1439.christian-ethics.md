### TITLE
**Christian Ethics - Friedrich Schleiermacher**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant theology (Romantic/idealist milieu; post-Enlightenment; Berlin academic context).
 - Written as systematic moral theology situated between pietistic devotionalism, Kantian moralism, and rising Hegelian social philosophy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Moral life must be grounded in Christian religious self-consciousness: authentic ethics is the social and practical outworking of a transformed God-consciousness realized in community.
 - Ethics cannot be purely formal duty (Kant) nor merely sociopolitical institution (Hegel) but must express a living religious relation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern moral philosophy abstracts duty from religious feeling or reduces religion to morality.
 - Proposal: reconstruct Christian ethics by rooting moral norms in the Christian experience of dependence upon God and the communal life of the church.
 - Practical loci: duties to God and neighbor, structures of communal moral life, and institutional means that form Christian persons (preaching, sacraments, prayer).
 - Eschatological telos: moral formation oriented toward an eschatological consummation of human relationality with God and community.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Kant (moral formalism), Fichte and Hegel (subjective and objective idealism), Rousseau (moral sentiment), Enlightenment moralists, patristic and Reformation sources, and contemporary pietism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (sin, freedom), Christology (redeeming moral power), ecclesiology (nature and marks of the church), means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer), revelation as basis for moral knowledge, eschatology as moral telos.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher situates Christian ethics as the communal, eschatologically‑directed expression of a renewed God‑consciousness, ecclesially mediated by preaching, sacraments, and prayer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Ethics as expression of religious feeling and community life rather than abstract law or mere social order.
 - Prioritizes formation (Bildung) of moral persons within ecclesial practices over legalistic rule-following.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against Kant: refuses a purely formal, autonomous moral law detached from religious life.
 - Against Hegel: resists reducing ethics to state or cultural Sittlichkeit without preserving the personal religious relation.
 - Reclaims pietistic inwardness but reframes it within systematic theology and institutional practice.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on "religious self-consciousness" as the foundation for moral norms.
 - Relational/communal reworking of ethical categories (sin, duty, love) in ecclesial context.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major source for 19th-century liberal Protestant ethics and theology; influential for later theological liberals and pastoral theology.
 - Criticized by neo-orthodoxy and confessionalists for perceived subjectivism and underemphasis on objective doctrinal content.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating devotional experience, church practice, and moral theology.
 - Useful corrective to both abstract moralism and sociological reductionism in contemporary ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Religious self-consciousness**
 - The foundational experience of dependence on God that yields moral norms.
- **Ethical community (Sittlichkeit in a Christian key)**
 - Moral reality embodied in the church's life and practices.
- **Eschatological anthropology**
 - Human nature understood as telic toward consummation in relation to God and others; sin as thwarting that telos.
 - Moral growth is eschatologically oriented transformation.
- **Means of grace**
 - Institutional practices (preaching, sacraments, prayer) that form moral character and sustain religious consciousness.
- **Preaching**
 - Primary formative medium: proclamation shapes communal conscience and guides Christian praxis.
- **Sacraments**
 - Symbolic-communicative practices that concretize belonging and moral renewal; not magic but community-forming signs.
- **Prayer**
 - Ethical posture and practice that cultivates dependence, alignment of will, and communal solidarity.
- **Conscience**
 - Function of religious self-consciousness mediating personal responsibility and communal norms.
- **Sin and alienation**
 - Moral pathology as relational estrangement; remedied not merely by law but by restorative communal practices.
- **Freedom and dependence**
 - Freedom defined relationally (freedom for God) rather than as isolated autonomy.
- **Moral formation (Bildung)**
 - Emphasis on cultivation of character in educational and ecclesial settings.
- **Revelation as moral source**
 - Scripture and Christology provide the normative content that grounds religious self-consciousness without reducing ethics to proposition alone.
- **Public and private moral spheres**
 - Ethical life traverses personal conscience and communal institutions; both need theological integration.
- **Hermeneutic of practice**
 - Interpretation of moral norms through the lens of lived ecclesial praxis.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for liberal Protestant moral theology emphasizing experience and ecclesial formation.
 - As a polemic against Kantian formalism and Hegelian reductionism, used to argue for a religiously grounded ethics.
 - As a pastoral/exegetical model for understanding preaching, sacraments, and prayer as constitutive of moral life.
