### TITLE
With Christ in the School of Prayer (1885) - Andrew Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-century evangelical/Reformed pietist milieu; Murray, a South African pastor trained in Dutch Reformed theology, writing within the broader evangelical revival and holiness currents of the era. The book functions as devotional-theological instruction for personal and congregational prayer life.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Prayer is the formative means through which the believer learns to live out **Union with Christ**; weakness in prayer reflects a failure to grasp and practice abiding union rather than merely defective technique.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Opening diagnosis: Christian life is impoverished because believers have not learned to depend in prayer.
 - Christ as Teacher: the believer must enter the "school" where Christ instructs in prayer - a continuous practice of abiding, waiting, and simple faith.
 - Practical principles: confession, dependence, waiting on God, secret unostentatious prayer, intercession, and submission to the Spirit.
 - Outcome: sustained prayer-union yields holiness, power for service, and spiritual fruit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary appeal to Scripture (notably John and the Gospels, passages on abiding); draws on Reformed piety, Puritan devotional emphases, and 19th-century evangelical holiness language. More pastoral than academic; interlocutors are common church practice and spiritual complacency rather than named theologians.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Union with Christ** (central), Christology (Christ as Teacher and Lord), Trinity (role of the Holy Spirit in prayer and abiding), sanctification, faith, grace, prayer as a means of grace, practical ecclesiology (prayer in church life).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Prayer is not an isolated duty but the practical school in which the believer is taught to live in vital, experiential union with Christ - and that union alone produces true holiness and power.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Frames prayer primarily as a school where one learns the life of union with Christ rather than a set of techniques or a list of duties.
 - Strong insistence on **simple, childlike faith** and waiting as the posture of effective prayer.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects moralistic or method-driven approaches to prayer by rooting efficacy in relational union rather than spiritual psychology or technique.
 - While resonant with Keswick and holiness themes, Murray stresses continual abiding (relational union) over a one-time crisis or merely experiential experience.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The recurring pedagogical metaphor **"school of prayer"** makes formation the central category: prayer as instruction and apprenticeship under Christ.
 - Integrates pastoral devotional counsel with theological categories (union, Spirit, faith) in a succinct, practice-oriented vocabulary.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in evangelical and Reformed devotional circles; became a classic handbook for pastors, missionaries, and laity.
 - Influenced later union-with-Christ and devotional literature; used extensively in missionary training and spiritual formation courses.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, theologically anchored manual linking doctrine (union) with practice (prayer).
 - Valuable for pastors and spiritual directors as a model of how to form prayer habits rooted in Christology and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Core doctrine; prayer is the principal means by which believers experience and learn to live this union.
- **Abide / Abiding:** Continual relational dependence on Christ (cf. John 15); the habit of prayer is the vehicle of abiding.
- **School of Prayer:** Metaphor for formative, discipling aspect of prayer - Christ as instructor and prayer as curriculum.
- **Christ as Teacher:** Christ personally instructs believers in prayer and life by the Spirit; not merely an object of petition.
- **Waiting:** Spiritual posture of expectant dependence; waiting is both discipline and expression of faith in prayer.
- **Simple faith / Childlike trust:** Opposed to complex techniques; efficacy depends on trustful reception of Christ.
- **Holy Spirit:** Active agent who enables abiding, interprets prayer, and produces fruit; prayer is Spirit-worked.
- **Confession & Dependence:** Practical steps - confession clears the way for deeper fellowship, dependence sustains continual prayer.
- **Intercession:** Mode of prayer shaped by union - praying from Christ for others, not merely petitions from self.
- **Sanctification / Holiness:** Fruit and aim of prayer; union with Christ lived in the school of prayer produces holiness.
- **Rest / Surrender:** Emphasizes restful submission over anxious striving in prayer.
- **Prayer as Means of Grace:** Prayer is a channel by which Christ gives Himself and grace to the believer.
- **Practice vs. Technique:** Distinguishes formative habitual practices from mechanical methods.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **devotional manual** for personal and congregational formation in prayer and holiness.
 - As a **definition source / pedagogical model** for teaching the practical implications of Union with Christ (bridging doctrine and practice).
 - As an **exegetical-practical model** for reading John 15 and other prayer texts in light of relational union rather than procedural instructions.
