### TITLE
**The Spirit and the Church: The Promise of Reformed Ecclesiology** (William B. Evans, Presbyterion, 2007)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-2000s Reformed academy engaged with post-conciliar ecumenism, renewed pneumatology, and debates over charismatic renewal within confessional traditions.
 - Conversation located at the intersection of classic Reformed covenant theology and contemporary interest in the Holy Spirit's ecclesial function.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The vitality and identity of the Reformed church depend upon recovering the Holy Spirit as the primary agent who effects and sustains union with Christ, thereby reshaping ecclesial doctrine and practice.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Reformed ecclesiology has at times defaulted to institutional/legal formulations (office, covenant administration, marks) that underemphasize the Spirit's formative and unifying role.
 - Retrieval: Scriptural and Reformational resources (esp. Pauline union language and Calvinian pneumatology) show the Spirit as both the means and guarantee of participation in Christ.
 - Application to loci:
 - Sacraments: argued as Spirit-mediated signs and seals, instrumental to but distinct from the Spirit's immediate work of incorporation.
 - Ministry and office: ordained ministry functions by the Spirit's gift and authorization; authority must be balanced with charismatic gifting and Spirit-wrought unity.
 - Discipline and communion: ecclesial boundaries are maintained by Spirit-wrought faithfulness, not merely juridical criteria.
 - Concluding claim: A pneumatologically centered Reformed ecclesiology preserves confessional distinctives while enabling vital, participatory church life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary engagement with Pauline theology (union with Christ), Calvinian and post-Calvinian Reformed sources on sacraments and Spirit, and contemporary pneumatological scholarship; interlocution with sacramental formalists, pietistic voluntarists, and charismatic critiques.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology, union with Christ, covenant theology, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesial office and ministry, communion of saints, justification/sanctification interplay.
- **Closing line**
 - Reformed ecclesiology regains its promise when it affirms that the Holy Spirit is the active power by which Christ's people are truly united to their Head and to one another.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes the Spirit as the constitutive agent of ecclesial identity rather than treating pneumatology as an adjunct to covenantal/institutional categories.
 - Reads union with Christ as the hermeneutical hinge for ecclesial doctrine: what unites believers to Christ also defines the church.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects a purely juridical/institutional Reformed ecclesiology that risks nominalism by reintroducing the immediacy of the Spirit's work.
 - Pushes back against charismatic-only accounts by situating gifts and experience within covenantal and sacramental structures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes a dialogical synthesis: "pneumatic-covenantal" interplay (Spirit as mediator of covenantal participation) without dissolving either category.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful in Reformed circles seeking balance between confessional order and spiritual vitality; cited in debates over charismatic renewal, sacramental practice, and pastoral formation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, theologically disciplined corrective to extremes on both sacramentalism and voluntarism; practical for pastors and seminarians rethinking church identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit**
 - Primary agent who effects regeneration, incorporation, and ongoing sanctification of the church.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central Pauline reality; the Spirit is the means by which believers are vitally and corporately united to Christ.
- **Covenant participation**
 - Participation in covenant blessings is pneumatologically realized, not merely legally assigned.
- **Sacrament: sign and seal**
 - Baptism and Supper function as Spirit-mediated means by which union is signified and strengthened.
- **Ordained ministry**
 - Office operates under the Spirit's gifting and authorization; legitimacy rests on both covenantal calling and pneumatological fruit.
- **Communion of saints**
 - Corporate unity grounded in shared pneumatic union with Christ; ecclesial fellowship is ontologically rooted in Spirit-wrought participation.
- **Justification/sanctification relation**
 - Justification remains forensic; sanctification is the Spirit's transformative fruit of union that evidences ecclesial life.
- **Marks of the church**
 - Preaching, sacraments, and discipline are vindicated through Spirit-produced faith and repentance, not mere external conformity.
- **Presence (real vs. spiritual)**
 - Advocates a robust "real spiritual presence": Christ truly present by the Spirit in sacraments and worship without collapse into mere symbolism.
- **Eschatological community**
 - The church is the already-not-yet body where Spirit-empowered life anticipates consummation.
- **Regeneration**
 - Instantaneous Spirit act effecting incorporation into Christ, initiating the visible church's hidden reality.
- **Gift and office**
 - Distinguishes charismatic gifts (distributed by Spirit) from ordained offices (ordered, sustained by Spirit).
- **Boundary practices (discipline)**
 - Ecclesial gating functions by Spirit-wrought repentance and reconciliation, not only legal pronouncement.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for a pneumatologically grounded Reformed ecclesiology.
 - As a polemical tool against ecclesial nominalism and against unchecked charismatic excess.
 - As an exegetical model for reading Pauline union texts into ecclesial doctrine and sacramental theology.
