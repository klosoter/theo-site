### TITLE
Kerygma and Myth (Kerygma und Mythos), Rudolf Bultmann (1941) - essays and critical responses on demythologizing the New Testament and rearticulating the Christian proclamation for modern existential thought.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1941 in wartime Germany amid theological crisis and methodological reappraisal.
 - Situated in 20th-century form-critical and existentialist milieus (influences: form criticism, Heideggerian existentialism).
 - Reaction to liberal historicism (Harnack), pietistic literalism, and growing modern scientific worldview.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament contains mythological cosmology incompatible with modern scientific thought; the task is **demythologization**: to interpret mythic elements existentially so the kerygma (proclamation) can speak to contemporary human existence.
 - Kerygma (eschatological event of God) is primary; mythic formulation is secondary and convertible into existential meaning without surrendering the proclamation's authority.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguish between myth (pre-scientific, cosmological narrative) and kerygma (proclaiming event that summons existential response).
 - Argue that mythic language about Christ, resurrection, Spirit, and eschatology points to an existential transformation (authentic existence, decision, encounter).
 - Offer methodological steps:
 - Identify mythic strata (miracles, spiritual powers, cosmic events).
 - Reinterpret these as symbolic expressions of existential truths (sin, death, new life, presence of God).
 - Preserve the kerygmatic content as the hermeneutical center while discarding naive cosmology.
 - Includes essays and critical back-and-forths: defenses of demythologization and replies to contemporaries.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages form critics and historical Jesus research; converses implicitly and explicitly with liberal theologians (Harnack), existential theologians (Tillich), and critics (later responses from Barthians and conservatives).
 - Uses Paul and the Synoptic kerygma as primary exemplars.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology:** parousia, delay of the Parousia, antichrist/man of lawlessness, millennial interpretations re-read existentially.
 - **Pneumatology:** Spirit's role in proclamation, new life, and resurrection as existential occurrence.
 - **Christology:** kerygmatic proclamation of Christ crucified and risen; critical engagement with kenosis-type language and two-natures formulations as theological attempts to speak the event.
 - **Anthropology & Creation:** human existence as situation requiring decision; mythic creation-talk as symbolic of relation to God.
 - **Doctrine of the Trinity & Covenant** appear indirectly as theological frameworks reconceived in kerygmatic terms.

- **Closing line**
 - Bultmann centers theology on the existentially effective **kerygma**, proposing demythologization as the hermeneutical path by which the Gospel becomes intelligible and decisive for modern beings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the proclamation (kerygma) over mythic cosmology and over purely historical verification.
 - Frames faith as existential decision and encounter, not merely assent to historical propositions.
 - Treats myth as symbolic language with existential referent rather than simply falsehood to be abandoned.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Harnack-style liberalism that reduced Christianity to ethical teachings; opposes literalist and apologetic attempts to preserve mythic cosmology by scientific accommodation.
 - Provokes critique from Barthians who affirm the objective Word-event yet worry Bultmann relativizes historical revelation into existential subjectivity.

- **Conceptual and terminological innovations**
 - Coined and systematized the program of **demythologization** as a disciplined hermeneutical practice.
 - Reframed "kerygma" as the decisive center of theological method.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential across mid-20th-century Protestant theology; sparked intense debate over resurrection, eschatology, and the authority of Scripture.
 - Mixed reception in Reformed circles: some adopted elements (focus on proclamation), others rejected perceived erosion of objective historical revelation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a sustained methodological challenge: how to preserve proclamation amid modern scientific presuppositions.
 - Remains a pivot for discussing how to handle New Testament mythic motifs (resurrection, Spirit, cosmic eschatology) in contemporary theology and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Demythologization** - hermeneutical program to reinterpret mythic language existentially while retaining kerygma.
- **Kerygma** - the Gospel proclamation as event; the hermeneutical center that summons existential decision.
- **Myth (mythos)** - pre-scientific cosmological narrative expressing religious truth symbolically rather than literally.
- **Existential interpretation** - reading New Testament events as existentially transformative rather than empirically descriptive.
- **Historical Jesus / historicity** - treated as distinct from the kerygma; historical-critical work useful but not identical to proclamation.
- **Resurrection and New Creation** - reinterpreted as existential transition to new existence; theological anchor for hope without requiring mythic cosmology.
- **Eschatology (Parousia, Antichrist, Millennial views)** - eschatological motifs recast as present-demanding summons rather than solely future cosmological events.
 - Includes treatment of the **Delay of the Parousia**: kerygma must explain continuing expectation as existential calling.
 - **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness** - read as symbolic of unbelieving existence and opposition to the kerygma.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit's role)** - Spirit is the present power effecting the kerygma's existential appropriation, not a mythic agent in cosmological terms.
 - Relates to debates on **Continuationism vs Cessationism**: Bultmann emphasizes present existential function rather than phenomenological continuation of miracle-talk.
- **Christology (kenosis, two-natures)** - doctrinal formulas are secondary theological articulations of the kerygma; Bultmann reads kenotic and Chalcedonian language as attempts to express the event of God in Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for demythologization and kerygma-focused hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against naive literalism and reductive historicism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reinterpreting resurrection, Spirit, and eschatological texts existentially.
 - As a conceptual **pivot** in debates on the relationship between proclamation, history, and modern worldview accommodation.
