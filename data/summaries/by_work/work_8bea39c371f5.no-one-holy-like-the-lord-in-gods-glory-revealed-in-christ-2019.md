### TITLE
**"No One Holy Like the Lord" - Peter J. Gentry, in God's Glory Revealed in Christ (2019)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed evangelical scholarship, canonical and redemptive-historical methodology; authored by an Old Testament specialist (Peter J. Gentry) contributing to a festschrift/collection on Christ as center of Scripture (2019).
 - Conversation occurs amid renewed interest in covenant theology, debates over Mosaic covenant status, and disputes between dispensational and progressive covenantal readings.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The holiness of Yahweh, as the defining attribute of God revealed in Israel's scriptures, shapes covenant form, law, cultus, and promises and finds its decisive realization in Christ; therefore proper reading of Mosaic law and covenantal structures must be Christ-centered and covenantally coherent.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical demonstration: surveys key OT loci (Exodus, Leviticus, Isaiah, Psalms) to show how language and practices of holiness function within covenant life.
 - Theological synthesis: argues holiness is not merely ritual purity but a covenantal demand and promise that frames obedience, worship, and restoration.
 - Redemptive-historical consequence: Jesus is presented as the fulfillment of divine holiness - he embodies the standard and accomplishes what covenant stipulations point toward, reconciling law, cult, and promise in the new covenant.
 - Polemical moves: corrects readings that either secularize holiness into mere ritualism or construe the Mosaic covenant principally as a covenant of works "as to substance."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages canonical OT texts primarily; interacts with covenant-theological interpreters (implicitly/explicitly addressing Klinean readings), dispensational critics, and proponents of progressive covenantalism.
 - Positions himself against readings that isolate Mosaic law from the covenant of grace and against sharp dispensational breaks.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (God's self-disclosure as holy), covenant (Mosaic and wider biblical covenants), law and cult (function of statutes and priesthood), Christology (fulfillment), soteriology (holiness, obedience, imputation/fulfillment).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - God's holiness is the interpretive hinge for covenant, law, and worship; Christ is the covenantal culmination in whom the holiness that ordered Israel's life is finally and fully realized.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Holiness as covenantal grammar: treats holiness language not as isolated cultic piety but as the governing category for covenant relation and redemptive history.
 - Christological reading of cultic and legal material without collapsing distinct institutional functions: the cult points forward to Christ's once-for-all fulfillment.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters readings that label the Mosaic covenant principally a covenant of works "as to substance" by emphasizing its embeddedness in the covenantal economy of promise and typology.
 - Critiques Klinean "intrusion" readings that over-prioritize covenant administration apart from promise/historical continuity; also challenges dispensationalist compartmentalization of covenants.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes holiness as a canonical-theological lens that unifies legal, cultic, and prophetic texts toward Christ - less a new term than a reorganizing principle for covenant theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for its careful OT exegesis married to covenantal theology; has been used in seminary classrooms and cited in debates over Mosaic covenant status and law's relation to the gospel.
 - Serves as a corrective resource for both strict Klineans and dispensationalists.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable exegetical model for reading holiness across Scripture; pedagogically useful in showing how OT law and worship point to Christ without erasing their historical function.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holiness of the Lord**
 - Central interpretive category; ethical, cultic, and covenantal force.

- **Mosaic Covenant**
 - Treated as covenant-shaped law within the progressive fulfillment of the covenant of grace, not merely a covenant of works.

- **Covenant of Works (as to substance)**
 - Critiqued when used to reduce Mosaic law to a standalone works-demand; Gentry insists on typological and promissory contexts.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The primary theological frame: promises through Adam/Abraham are fulfilled progressively and culminate in Christ.

- **Klinean Covenant Theology**
 - Engaged critically: accepts some structural insights but resists excessive emphasis on covenant administration and "intrusion ethics."

- **Intrusion Ethics**
 - The notion that God's covenant acts are primarily sovereign intrusions; Gentry nuance: divine intrusion must be read within covenantal promise and typology.

- **Dispensationalism**
 - Opposed where it fragments covenant continuity; Gentry argues for redemptive-historical continuity centered on Christ.

- **Progressive Covenantalism**
 - Partly affirmed in its emphasis on unfolding revelation, but Gentry retains classical covenant categories (covenant of grace, typology).

- **Biblical Covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New)**
 - Read as interconnected acts in one covenantal economy progressing toward fulfillment in Christ.

- **Cultic/Liturgical Law**
 - Seen as typological and formative, directing worship toward the holiness realized in Christ.

- **Typology / Fulfillment in Christ**
 - Methodological principle: cultic and legal forms find their telos in Jesus.

- **Covenantal Nomism (implicit contrast)**
 - Gentry's view aligns with covenantal continuity - law functions within covenant promise, not as purely legalistic meritism.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies "holiness" as a theological-canonical term linked to covenant structure.
 - Polemic: deployed against Klinean over-formalizations and dispensational discontinuities.
 - Exegetical model: a template for reading cultic/legal texts Christologically within redemptive history.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in teaching to integrate OT holiness, covenant, and New Testament fulfillment.
