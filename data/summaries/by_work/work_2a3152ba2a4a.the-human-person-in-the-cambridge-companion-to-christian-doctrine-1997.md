### TITLE
"The Human Person" - John Webster, in The Cambridge Companion to Christian Doctrine (1997)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed theological resurgence; post-Barthian renewal in British theology. Webster writes within a confessional, doctrinally rigorous milieu reacting against secularizing and reductive modern conceptions of personhood.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Anthropology must be read eschatologically: the human person is properly understood only in relation to God's redemptive action in Christ and the promised consummation. Any account that abstracts the person from creaturely dependence, covenantal relation, and resurrection hope is theologically deficient.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Human identity is rooted not in autonomous substantiality but in created relation: persons are creatures whose being is defined by God's address and promise.
 - The Fall distorts personhood; redemption reconstitutes it within a Christological economy - union with Christ, justification, sanctification, and ultimately bodily resurrection are constitutive of true human personhood.
 - Eschatological consummation supplies the telos that secures both moral and ontological claims about persons: vocation, embodiment, and sociality are ordered to the new creation.
 - Practical corollary: ecclesial and sacramental structures mediate the formation of persons as those destined for communion with God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavily engaged with Barthian themes (createdness, divine address), draws on classical resources (Augustine, Calvin) while contrasting modern secular philosophers and sociologists of the self (liberal individualism, existential autonomy).
 - Implicit conversation with Thomistic substance metaphysics and contemporary phenomenology about embodiment and subjectivity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, Trinity (as horizon for relationality), Imago Dei, Fall, Christology (union with Christ), redemption, sanctification, resurrection, ecclesiology, sacramentology, eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Webster locates the human person squarely in the economy of redemption: persons are creaturely, embodied, relational agents whose true being is promised and realized in Christ's resurrection and the life of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Eschatological priority**: anthropological claims are subordinate to, and defined by, the future consummation God promises.
 - **Relational ontology**: personhood is primarily a status conferred within God's covenantal address, not an isolated substantial self.
 - **Embodiment and resurrection**: insistence that bodily glorification, not mere immortality of a disembodied soul, is central.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against modern liberal individualism that treats persons as autonomous rational agents; critiques reductionist biological or psychological accounts that ignore theological categories.
 - Resists purely existential or phenomenological accounts that evacuate eschatological content and ecclesial mediation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames "person" decisively as a theological category: a creaturely beneficiary of divine promise rather than an abstract ontological unit.
 - Uses eschatological telos as a hermeneutical key to redeem and delimit other anthropological terms (agency, vocation, freedom).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and Anglican theologians seeking a doctrinally dense anthropology; contributed to renewed emphasis on sacramental and ecclesial dimensions of personhood.
 - Cited in debates about bioethics, pastoral theology, and ecclesial formation where theological vision of the person matters.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a corrective to contemporary secular accounts of the self, supplies a robust framework for integrating doctrine (Trinity, Christology, eschatology) into anthropology, and functions well in teaching contexts that seek a compact, doctrinally integrated account of human identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological anthropology**
 - Anthropology that defines persons by their destiny in God's consummating act.
- **Creatureliness**
 - Emphasis on dependence, finitude, and created status under God's sovereignty.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)**
 - Not an abstract property but a vocational status realized in fellowship with God and others; tied to renewal in Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The decisive relational category by which personhood is restored and oriented to the resurrection.
- **Resurrection / bodily glorification**
 - The ultimate affirmation of embodied personhood; counters dualist or purely spiritual immortality.
- **Covenant / address**
 - Personhood is constituted by God's speech and promise; persons exist as recipients of divine relation.
- **Ecclesial mediation**
 - The church and sacraments are principal loci where persons are formed as participants in the eschatological life.
- **Vocation**
 - Personal identity as call and responsibility within God's redemptive purposes.
- **Sin and alienation**
 - Distortions of personhood requiring reconciliation; not merely moral failure but ontological displacement.
- **Relational ontology**
 - Priority of relations over isolated substantial selfhood; Trinity as normative horizon.
- **Freedom (reconfigured)**
 - Freedom understood as participation in promised redemption rather than autonomous self-determination.
- **Finitude and dependence**
 - Theological virtues: humility before God that grounds ethical and ecclesial life.

How this work is used across loci
- **Definition source**: as a concise, doctrinally integrated definition of Christian personhood for systematic theology summaries.
- **Polemic tool**: to critique modern secular and reductionist anthropologies in ethics and bioethics.
- **Conceptual pivot**: employed in ecclesiology and sacramental theology to argue for church-based formation of persons toward eschatological ends.
