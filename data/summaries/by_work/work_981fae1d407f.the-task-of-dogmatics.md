### TITLE
The Task of Dogmatics - Oliver D. Crisp & Fred Sanders

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary, early-21st-century recovery of dogmatics within evangelical, Reformed, and analytic theology streams. Responds to methodological fragmentation in theological studies (historical, biblical, philosophical, practical) and to calls for a robust, argumentatively disciplined systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Dogmatics remains an indispensable, constructive discipline: it must integrate Scripture, tradition, and reason to produce coherent, church‑shaped doctrine. The task is to defend and rearticulate the aims, norms, and methods of dogmatics for theology today.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Locate dogmatics within the theological enterprise: its relation to biblical theology, historical theology, and practical theology.
 - Articulate normative sources (primacy of Scripture, role of creeds, place of ecclesial reception).
 - Recommend methodological tools (analytic clarity, philosophical resources, exegetical fidelity) for constructive work.
 - Showcase examples of doctrinal reconstruction (e.g., Trinity, Christology, atonement) to illustrate method.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Dialogues with historical authorities (e.g., patristic and Reformation traditions) and contemporary interlocutors across evangelical, Reformed, and analytic theology. Engages current methodological debates (historicism, Biblicism, neo‑Barthian anti‑systematics, analytic theology) and draws on philosophical resources where needed.
- **Doctrines treated:** Method and normativity of doctrine; Trinity and classical Trinitarian theology; Christology and atonement; revelation and Scripture; ecclesiology and creeds; general doctrines (creation, providence, eschatology) as touchstones for method.
- **Closing line:** Dogmatics is a disciplined, constructive, ecclesial enterprise that integrates scriptural fidelity, confessional identity, and rigorous philosophical clarity to produce coherent doctrine for the church and academy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses dogmatics as both a normative and argumentative discipline - not merely historical description nor private speculation.
 - Emphasizes the productive use of analytic philosophical tools to sharpen doctrinal claims without abandoning confessional commitments.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against anti‑systematic tendencies (forms of neo‑Barthian suspicion of systematic construction) and against reductions of theology to purely historical or literary tasks.
 - Corrects liberal historicist accounts that treat doctrines as merely evolving cultural artifacts by restoring doctrine's normative and formative role.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advocates for a more integrated grammar of dogmatics that ties exegetical findings, doctrinal tradition, and philosophical argumentation into a stable methodological vocabulary.
 - Sharpens the distinction between descriptive theology (what Christians have believed) and constructive dogmatics (what ought to be affirmed and defended).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received positively among those seeking rigorous, confessional systematic theology that can engage contemporary analytic philosophy and biblical scholarship.
 - Influential in graduate curricula for methodological seminars; cited in discussions about the renewal of doctrinal theology within evangelical and Reformed contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise methodological handbook for students learning how to do constructive dogmatics.
 - Provides a model for integrating exegetical fidelity, historical consciousness, and philosophical rigor.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dogmatics:** Constructive, normative systematic theology that formulates, defends, and applies Christian doctrine for the church.
- **Normativity:** The claim that Scripture (and confessional reception) sets the standards for theological truth and ecclesial belief.
- **Constructive theology / constructive dogmatics:** Active formulation of doctrine that answers contemporary questions while remaining tethered to biblical and confessional resources.
- **Analytic theology:** Use of analytic philosophical methods (clarity, argument structure, conceptual analysis) to clarify and justify doctrinal claims.
- **Exegetical fidelity:** The commitment that doctrinal claims be rooted in responsible interpretation of biblical texts.
- **Confessional identity:** The role of historic creeds and confessions as mediating norms within dogmatics.
- **Descriptive vs. prescriptive theology:** Distinction between describing past beliefs and prescribing doctrines the church should hold.
- **Ecclesial formation:** The function of dogmatics in shaping church worship, life, and witness.
- **Methodological integration:** The project of bringing exegetical, historical, and philosophical resources into coherent methodological practice.
- **Coherence approach:** A model for doctrine that emphasizes internal consistency and mutual intelligibility among loci.
- **Philosophical Theology / metaphysics:** The use of metaphysical categories where necessary to make sense of doctrinal claims (e.g., personhood in Trinitarian and Christological claims).
- **Reception history:** Attention to how doctrines have been received, debated, and ratified in the church.
- **Churchly apologetics:** Defense of doctrine oriented to the church's proclamation and witness, not merely academic victory.
- **Loci theologiae:** Traditional doctrinal headings treated as interconnected nodes for systematic construction.
- Usage across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source**: clarifies what counts as constructive dogmatics in coursework and research.
 - As a **polemic resource**: used to critique anti‑systematic or narrowly historical approaches.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies vocabulary and structure for projects integrating analytic philosophy, exegesis, and confessional theology in particular doctrinal loci.
