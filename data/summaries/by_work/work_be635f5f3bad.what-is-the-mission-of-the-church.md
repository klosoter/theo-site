### TITLE
**What Is the Mission of the Church?** 
Kevin DeYoung and Greg Gilbert (Crossway, 2011) 
Subtitle: Making Sense of Social Justice, Shalom, and the Great Commission

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical context (New Calvinism, 9Marks, The Gospel Coalition).
 - Written as a corrective to rising emphases on "integral mission", social-justice centered ministry, and some strains of the emergent/contemporary mission conversation.
 - Pastoral authors addressing pastors and lay leaders concerned with practical mission priorities.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The church's mission is primarily to make disciples by proclaiming the gospel, baptizing, and teaching (the Great Commission). Social action and shalom are important but subsidiary and derivative, not the defining aim.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Statement of problem: confusion over mission language (shalom, justice, kingdom, mission).
 - Exegesis of New Testament mission texts, especially the Great Commission (Matt 28), Acts, and Paul.
 - Theological synthesis: mission in light of the gospel, means of grace, and church identity.
 - Practical implications: how churches should order priorities, ministries, and resources.
 - Conclusion: social action as fruit of gospel-driven disciplemaking, not replacement for it.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interacts broadly with proponents of integral mission and social-justice emphases (contemporary missiologists, some popular pastors and NGOs).
 - Dialogues implicitly with historical Reformers (Calvinian emphasis on Word-centered ministry) and modern evangelical leaders who emphasize both gospel and social engagement.
 - Uses Scripture, pastoral experience, and evangelical theology rather than heavy academic historiography.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (mission as church identity)
 - Soteriology (gospel as the engine of mission and transformation)
 - Revelation and authority of Scripture (text-centered exegesis of mission passages)
 - Sacramentology (baptism and the Lord's Supper as means in disciplemaking)
 - Ethics and social doctrine (charity, justice, common grace)
 - Eschatology (mission in light of inaugurated but not consummated kingdom)

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically and pastorally: **the mission of the church is making disciples through gospel proclamation and means of grace; social justice is commanded, necessary, and ministerial, but subordinate and consequent to the gospel-centered mission.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp re-centering of mission language on the Great Commission as normative for church action.
 - Clear distinction between first-order mission (evangelism/discipleship) and second-order goods (service, relief, justice).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects what the authors see as the overcorrection of contemporary missiology that elevates social transformation or "shalom" to the primary aim.
 - Contrasts with integral-mission advocates by insisting on doctrinal primacy of the gospel rather than social outcomes.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Practical taxonomy: mission as proclamation/discipleship versus social ministry as derivative service.
 - Use of simple pastoral heuristics (means vs. ends; primary vs. secondary mission tasks) rather than complex missiological categories.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clarifying, accessible corrective.
 - Criticized by some missiologists and mainline theologians who view it as downplaying structural injustice and the biblical breadth of shalom.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful primer for pastors/students seeking a concise, biblically grounded refocusing of congregational priorities.
 - Serves as a discussion-starter in mission courses where the balance of proclamation and social action is contested.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Great Commission**: Normative biblical charter (Matt 28:18-20) for church mission; central text in the book.
- **Gospel proclamation**: Primary means of mission; the verbal announcement of Christ's saving work.
- **Discipleship**: Formation in Christlikeness; the ongoing task that follows conversion and baptism.
- **Shalom**: Biblical peace and flourishing; affirmed but framed as a fruit/result of gospel work, not the defining mission aim.
- **Social justice**: Proper ethic and duty of Christians; subordinate to disciplemaking and to be pursued as a consequence of the gospel.
- **Integral mission**: Term for approaches that fuse evangelism and social transformation; book critiques its elevation above proclamation.
- **Means of grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer - the primary instruments God uses to accomplish mission in the church.
- **Kingdom of God**: Theologically present-inaugurated and eschatologically consummated; mission operates amid this tension.
- **Common grace**: Grounds for Christians' cultural and social engagement apart from conversion.
- **Eschatology**: Provides horizon for mission - hope of consummation shapes urgency and perspective.
- **Ecclesiology**: Church identity as the sent community; mission is anchored in corporate worship and order.
- **Witness**: Christian testimony that is verbal, visible (works), and sacramental; priority given to verbal proclamation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical/Reformed mission theology emphasizing proclamation first.
 - As a **polemic** against social-gospel and certain forms of integral mission that sideline evangelism.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for pastors: short, text-focused exegesis applied to church planning and priorities.
