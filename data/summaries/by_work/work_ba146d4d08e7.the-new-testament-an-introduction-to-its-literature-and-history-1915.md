### TITLE
**The New Testament: An Introduction to Its Literature and History (1915)** - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1915 amid the rising modernist-fundamentalist conflict; Machen writing as a conservative Princeton New Testament scholar reacting to German higher criticism and liberal theology.
 - Intellectual milieu: late-19th/early-20th-century historical-critical scholarship (Baur, Wrede, Harnack, Wellhausen in Old Testament analogues) and American fundamentalist mobilization.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament is to be treated as a body of historically situated literature whose apostolic origin, doctrinal content, and canonical authority can and should withstand critical-historical scrutiny.
 - Machen seeks to reconcile rigorous historical inquiry with a high view of revelation, inspiration, and apostolic tradition.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Starts with general principles for studying New Testament literature and history (authorship, date, provenance, purpose).
 - Surveys individual books: authorship questions, date, sources, literary genre, theological emphasis, and historical setting.
 - Applies textual and historical criticism selectively to defend traditional conclusions where evidence is weighty; rejects radical skepticism that severs the NT from apostolic foundations.
 - Concludes with reflections on the place of the NT in the Christian canon and its normative role for doctrine and life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with German critical scholarship (e.g., Wrede on Mark, Baur on Pauline studies), contemporary English-language scholarship, and patristic data where relevant.
 - Implicit polemic against scholars who unduly minimize apostolicity or historicity of gospel and epistolary materials.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (as presuppositions for historical study).
 - Christology (historical Jesus vs. early Christian proclamation).
 - Resurrection and historicity of core events.
 - Canon, apostolic authority, and tradition.
 - Ecclesiology implicitly via apostolic witness and texts.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Machen advances a model of New Testament study that is historically conscientious but theologically committed: the NT is apostolic literature whose historical credibility undergirds its role as normative revelation for the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that responsible historical criticism need not produce theological scepticism; critical methods can defend, not merely undermine, apostolic claims.
 - Balances textual-historical analysis with doctrinal concerns; places canonical and ecclesial usage alongside external-critical data.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects radical German higher criticism by resisting reductive reconstructions that dismiss traditional authorship and the resurrection narratives as myth.
 - Contrasts with anti-intellectual strands of fundamentalism by employing learned sources and critical tools rather than mere fideism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - No striking neologisms, but notable for consolidating the phrase "literature and history" as a methodological frame that insists both literary and historical modes are necessary for NT study.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative and Reformed circles; helped shape early 20th-century evangelical scholarship and Machen's later institutional moves (e.g., Westminster Theological Seminary).
 - Valued as a measured, learned alternative to both liberal capitulation and fundamentalist hostility to scholarship.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a clear, robust introductory textbook still useful for demonstrating how to marry historical criticism with confessional commitments.
 - Models disciplined engagement with opponents and careful weighing of evidence without abandoning doctrinal seriousness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon**
 - Treated as apostolic, historically rooted list of writings with normative authority; canonicity is argued from provenance, usage, and doctrinal fitness.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Central criterion for NT authority; Machen emphasizes connection to eyewitness testimony and apostolic teaching.
- **Authorship**
 - Investigates traditional attributions (Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, Pauline corpus) and defends many traditional conclusions against wholesale rejection.
- **Historical Criticism**
 - Employed as a tool, not an end: useful for dating, provenance, and probability judgments, but limited where reconstructive speculation overrides evidence.
- **Textual Criticism**
 - Recognized as foundational for recovering original text before historical or theological interpretation.
- **Inspiration / Revelation**
 - Understood as compatible with historical investigation; Machen presumes divine revelation expressed through historically situated apostolic literature.
- **Christology**
 - Differentiates the "historical Jesus" from the "kerygma" while defending the essential historicity of gospel claims, especially resurrection and divine christological assertions.
- **Resurrection**
 - Treated as a historically grounded event central to apostolic preaching and the NT's theological claims.
- **Synoptic Problem**
 - Discussed with engagement of critical hypotheses but with deference to methodological humility and retention of traditional cores.
- **Tradition**
 - Seen as the living transmission channel by which apostolic teaching became fixed in written form and ecclesial reception.
- **Canon And Tradition (site topic)**
 - Machen used to argue that canonical formation is not merely historical accident but the result of apostolic tradition recognized by the church; therefore canon and tradition mutually corroborate.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative understandings of canon, apostolicity, and the relation of revelation to history.
- As a **polemic** against liberal higher criticism that severs doctrinal commitments from historical study.
- As an **exegetical/introductory model** demonstrating disciplined book-by-book analysis that integrates literary, historical, and theological concerns.
