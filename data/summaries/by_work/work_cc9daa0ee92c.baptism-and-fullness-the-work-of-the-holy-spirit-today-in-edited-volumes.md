### TITLE
Baptism and Fullness: The Work of the Holy Spirit Today - Sinclair B. Ferguson (essay in edited volumes)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed-evangelical milieu, written amid continuing debate between Pentecostal/charismatic and cessationist positions.
 - Ferguson writes as a conservative Reformed theologian receptive to charismatic renewal but committed to covenantal and ecclesial norms.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The work argues that the New Testament concept of the Spirit's baptism is properly understood in the framework of union with Christ and the new covenant, while the ongoing experience of the Spirit's "fullness" describes repetitive empowerments for sanctification and mission rather than a uniform second crisis-event. Ferguson seeks a middle path between crude second-blessing models and flat cessationism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definitional groundwork: clarifies semantic range of "baptism" and "filling" in New Testament Greek and early church usage.
 - Exegetical move: reads key texts (Pauline corpus, Acts, Johannine material) to locate Spirit-baptism at the believer's union with Christ (once-for-all) and "filling" as recurring empowerment.
 - Pastoral-theological implications: sketches ecclesial practice (preaching, sacraments, prayer) for cultivating Spirit fullness while guarding order and doctrinal integrity.
 - Polemical balance: critiques both Pentecostal insistence on a distinct, normative post-conversion baptism with tongues as normative evidence, and cessationist denials of charismatic gifts.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages New Testament texts primarily; dialogues broadly with Pentecostal/charismatic theologians and classical Reformed critics (no single interlocutor dominates).
 - Draws on historical theology to show continuity with Reformation emphases on union with Christ and the Spirit's work in sanctification.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (central): baptism, filling, gifts, Spirit's role in regeneration and sanctification.
 - **Soteriology**: union with Christ, regeneration as Spirit-work.
 - **Ecclesiology**: mission, ministry, order in public worship.
 - **Sacramentology**: relation between water baptism and Spirit-baptism.
 - **Eschatology**: "already/not yet" aspects of Spirit gifts and empowerment.

- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson centers the discussion on the Spirit as the Lord who unites believers to Christ (baptism) and repeatedly empowers them for holy living and mission (fullness), insisting on biblical restraint and pastoral wisdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Prioritizes **union with Christ** as the canonical locus of Spirit-baptism, making baptism primarily soteriological and covenantal rather than merely experiential.
 - Distinguishes carefully between the ontological (once-for-all) and functional/occasional (repeated filling) aspects of the Spirit's work.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects the classical Pentecostal notion of a normative, distinct second baptism whose typical sign must be tongues.
 - Counters strict cessationism by affirming the continuing reality of Spirit gifts and recurrent fill‑ings for ministry.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes a two-tier usage: **"baptism" = incorporation into Christ; "fullness/filling" = empowerment for service**. This becomes a concise rubric used by later Reformed-charismatic interlocutors.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Reformed circles that wish to retain confessional theology while engaging charismatic experience responsibly.
 - Frequently cited by pastors and teachers seeking a balanced pneumatology that avoids polar extremes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, pastorally-minded exegetical model that is teachable, applicable in congregational contexts, and useful for theological formation across denominations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - For Ferguson: primarily the Spirit's once-for-all incorporation of believers into Christ (union, positional reality).

- **Filling / Fullness of the Spirit**
 - Recurrent experiences of empowerment for sanctification, witness, and ministry; not synonymous with initial baptism.

- **Regeneration**
 - The Spirit's act of giving new life, closely tied to Spirit-baptism in Ferguson's schema.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The theological center: the ontological effectual bond that locates Spirit-baptism.

- **Charismatic gifts / Spiritual gifts**
 - Recognized as ongoing, distributed by the Spirit for the church's building and mission; their exercise must be regulated by Scripture and order.

- **Tongues**
 - Treated as one phenomenon among gifts; Ferguson resists treating it as normative proof for Spirit baptism.

- **Second blessing / Second work of grace**
 - Critiqued when framed as a universal, necessary post-conversion rite; Ferguson reframes empowerment as repeated fillings rather than a required second event.

- **Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Ferguson avoids strict cessationism and favors a measured continuationism that affirms gifts but insists on theological constraints.

- **Water baptism**
 - Connected sacramentally to Spirit-baptism in church practice, but not identical; water baptism symbolizes incorporation effected by the Spirit.

- **Sanctification**
 - The Spirit's progressive work received through both baptismal union and recurrent fill‑ings.

- **Eschatological "already/not yet"**
 - Explains why gifts and empowerment are present now yet imperfect until consummation.

- **Evidence / Signs**
 - Ferguson cautions against simplistic evidential tests (e.g., tongues) and recommends broader fruit-oriented assessment.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for a Reformed, balanced understanding of Spirit-baptism and filling.
- As a **polemic** against both excesses of experientialism and rigid cessationism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline passages on baptism and gifts under the rubric of union with Christ.
- As a **pastoral/congregational resource** for discipling believers in dependence on Spirit empowerment.
