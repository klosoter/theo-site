### TITLE
God (selected articles: "Absolute and Relative Attributes") - Charles Hodge, The Princeton Review

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Princeton Review essays; situated within the Princeton School (Old School Presbyterian, Reformed orthodox milieu). Reaction to Enlightenment rationalism, liberal German theology, and emergent American theological pluralism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To defend a Biblically grounded classical theism asserting that God's attributes are real, unified in one simple divine essence, and to clarify the distinction between attributes that are absolute (incommunicable) and those that are relative (communicable or relational) without making God's moral character contingent on creation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define **absolute attributes** (those that belong to God in and of Himself: aseity, simplicity, immutability, eternity, omnipotence, omniscience).
 - Define **relative attributes** (those that express God's relations to creation: Father, Judge, Redeemer; also ways moral attributes are manifested).
 - Argue that attributes are not separable parts but different conceptions of one identical divine essence (classical divine simplicity).
 - Maintain moral attributes (holiness, justice, love) as essential and eternal - not mere effects of relations with creatures.
 - Insist that Scripture is the normative criterion to understand both kinds of attributes; natural theology can point to them but revelation secures their content.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy reliance on Scripture and the Reformed tradition (Calvin, Augustine), systematic theology models (Aquinas in methodical respects), polemical stance against Schleiermacher, radicals of rationalist and Unitarian currents, and emergent theological liberalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Theology proper (attributes of God), divine simplicity, immutability, omniscience, omnipotence, divine sovereignty, moral attributes (holiness, righteousness, love), revelation and anthropomorphic language.
- **Closing line:** Hodge argues for a coherent Reformed classical theism in which God's absolute and relative attributes are unified expressions of one simple, holy, and revealed divine essence that grounds doctrine, worship, and ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precise insistence that moral attributes are not relational addenda but eternal aspects of God's being - preserves both sovereignty and moral perfection.
 - Careful taxonomy: absolute vs relative mapped onto incommunicable vs communicable without collapsing the categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Counters tendencies that treat God's moral attributes as contingent responses to the world (common in some modern or liberal theologies).
 - Pushback against speculative philosophy that fragments the divine into modal properties or limits simplicity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear, pedagogical framing of "absolute" and "relative" attributes tailored for apologetic and systematic use in an American Reformed academy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Princeton Seminary and mainstream American Reformed circles; served as a standard exposition for theology proper in 19th-20th century conservative seminaries.
 - Later critiqued by neo-orthodox, existential, and process theologians who rejected divine immutability or classical simplicity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplifies careful analytic theology rooted in Scripture and Reformed confessional commitments; remains a primary resource for teaching orthodox conceptions of attributes and for polemics against reductionist accounts of God's nature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes:** Traits belonging to God in Himself (e.g., aseity, simplicity, immutability); not dependent on creaturely relations.
- **Relative attributes:** Traits describing God's relations to creatures (e.g., Father, Judge, Redeemer); expressive of how God acts toward creation.
- **Divine simplicity:** The doctrine that God's attributes are not parts but identical with his singular essence; guards unity of God.
- **Immutability:** God is unchanging in essence, will, and purpose; change would imply imperfection or dependence.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence from creation.
- **Omniscience / Omnipotence / Omnipresence:** Classical theistic perfections affirmed as absolute attributes.
- **Moral attributes (holiness, righteousness, love):**
 - Treated as essential and eternal; not produced by creaturely interaction.
 - Serve as basis for doctrinal claims about divine justice and grace.
- **Communicable vs Incommunicable:** Overlaps with relative/absolute language; communicable attributes are those humans may reflect (e.g., love, justice), incommunicable are strictly divine (e.g., aseity).
- **Anthropomorphism:** Hodge emphasizes normative interpretation - anthropomorphic language in Scripture is analogical, reflecting human-limited conceptions of divine acts.
- **Revelation vs Natural Theology:** Scripture is decisive; natural theology may indicate attributes but cannot replace revelatory content.
- **Sovereignty:** Rooted in absolute attributes and underwrites providence and election.
- **Relation:** Distinguishes ontological simplicity from relational predicates used in Scripture and pastoral proclamation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** in theology proper courses for classical attributes and taxonomies (absolute/relative; communicable/incommunicable).
- As a **polemic** against liberal reductions of God's moral character and against theological systems that deny simplicity or immutability.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading attributive language in Scripture analogically while maintaining doctrinal coherence.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking metaphysical claims about God to pastoral and ethical implications (e.g., divine justice and love as foundations for Christian morality).
