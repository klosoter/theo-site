### TITLE
**A Display of Arminianism - John Owen**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑17th century English Reformed context; Owen writes as a leading Puritan divine responding to Post‑Reformation controversies (Remonstrant/Arminian thought, English Arminianism, and the aftermath of Dort and civil‑church struggles).
 - Polemical and pastoral occasion: a careful refutation intended for clergy and educated laity to resist a resurgence of conditionalist soteriology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Arminianism, by making election conditional on foreseen faith and by positing a resistible or prevenient grace, undermines divine sovereignty, the sufficiency and particularity of Christ's atonement, and the necessity of efficacious grace. Owen argues that Scripture requires unconditional, efficacious divine decrees and a corresponding doctrine of grace.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exposition of Arminian positions (what they affirm about free will, conditional election, universal atonement, prevenient grace).
 - Philosophical and theological critique: demonstrates internal inconsistencies (e.g., how conditional election nullifies divine immutability and providential causality).
 - Biblical and pastoral proof: exegetical appeals (notably Pauline texts) showing human inability, the necessity and particularity of Christ's satisfaction, and the efficacy of divine choosing.
 - Practical repercussions: shows effects on assurance, prayer, evangelism, and Christian comfort.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary target: Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrant tradition and their English exponents; dialogue also with moderate figures (e.g., Baxterian nuances) and the broader scholastic Reformed corpus (Synod of Dort assumptions).
 - Uses Scripture, classical scholastic logic, and pastoral experience.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Total Depravity / Total Inability** - human will incapable of saving good without efficacious grace.
 - **Atonement** - necessity, extent (particularity/limited atonement), and theory (penal satisfaction/substitution).
 - **Divine Decrees / Election / Reprobation** - unconditional election; active decrees of God as causa prima of salvation.
 - Also treats calling, justification, perseverance, assurance, and the nature of grace.

- **Closing line**
 - A Display of Arminianism centers the absolute sovereignty and efficaciousness of God in salvation: true doctrine secures Christ's particular satisfaction and the certainty of salvation against conditionalist contingency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous articulation of **total inability** (not mere moral weakness but a bound, enslaved will) that makes efficacious grace necessary.
 - Forceful defense of **particular redemption**: Christ's death is effectual for the elect, not merely sufficient in a universal but ineffectual sense.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Arminian conditionalism by arguing it dislocates divine immutability and providence; pushes beyond mere negative refutation to show pastoral consequences (loss of assurance, reliance on human merit).
 - More systematic and uncompromising than many contemporaries who sought middle paths (e.g., Baxter).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of "total inability" to mark the will's inability apart from sovereign, efficacious grace.
 - Emphasis that divine decrees are not merely permissive backgrounds but **operative** causal principles in salvation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard polemic in Reformed circles; influential for subsequent English and American Calvinists and for later high‑Calvinist formulations.
 - Arminian critics continued to engage it; it sharpened the terms of debate in soteriological controversies.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact exemplar of Puritan polemical method: combination of exegetical force, philosophical rigor, and pastoral concern.
 - Useful as a model for defending doctrines of grace and for understanding historical Calvinist responses to conditional election.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity / Total Inability**
 - Owen: human will is morally incapable of choosing saving good without sovereignly efficacious grace; grounds the need for divine causation in conversion.

- **Efficacious (Effectual) Grace**
 - Grace that infallibly produces its intended end (conversion); distinguished from merely prevenient or assisting grace.

- **Prevenient Grace**
 - Arminian category critiqued by Owen as insufficient to overcome total inability when conceived as resistible.

- **Particular Redemption / Limited Atonement**
 - Christ's death is redemptive and effectual specifically for the elect; Owen defends penal substitution with particular application.

- **Penal Substitution**
 - Owen insists on satisfaction in respect to guilt and the necessity of Christ's surety for those actually redeemed.

- **Divine Decrees (Eternal, Unconditional Election)**
 - God elects not on foreseen faith but by an eternal, sovereign purpose that efficaciously brings the elect to salvation.

- **Reprobation**
 - The counterpart to election: Owen treats it as an enacted divine decree consistent with divine justice and sovereignty.

- **Conditional Election**
 - The Arminian thesis Owen opposes: election dependent on foreseen faith; shown to collapse key attributes of God and soterial certainty.

- **Assurance**
 - Owen links assurance to a right doctrine of decrees and the effectual nature of Christ's work; conditionalism undermines it.

- **Order of Salvation (Ordo Salutis)**
 - Owen's implicit order: divine decree → effectual calling → justification → perseverance; emphasizes causal priority of grace.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of total inability, particular atonement, and unconditional election.
 - As a **polemic** in debates with Arminianism and in defense of high Calvinist soteriology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline texts bearing on election, calling, and the efficacy of Christ's death.
