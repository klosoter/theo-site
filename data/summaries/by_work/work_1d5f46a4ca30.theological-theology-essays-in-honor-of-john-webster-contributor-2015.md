### TITLE
Theological Theology: Essays in Honor of John Webster (2015) - contribution by Scott R. Swain

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** A 2015 Festschrift honoring John Webster situated in contemporary Reformed-Anglican theological renewal. The volume participates in a wider turn toward "theological theology" - theology done primarily from God's self-revelation in Scripture and the doctrine of the Trinity, as opposed to theology driven by extra-theological philosophical commitments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Swain's essay treats the problem of how to speak of God's attributes without severing God's **ontological simplicity** from God's **relational, economic life**. He focuses on the category pair **absolute vs relative attributes** and argues that a properly theological account must keep these predicates rooted in Trinitarian, Christocentric revelation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Brief diagnosis: modern and some analytic approaches risk abstracting attributes into a list of properties divorced from God's self-disclosure.
 - Historical retrieval: draws on classical and Reformed resources to show how traditionally absolute and relative predicates function as modes of speaking about the one divine essence.
 - Theological proposal: argues for a hermeneutic in which **absolute attributes** (omniscience, omnipotence, immutability construed rightly) and **relative attributes** (Fatherhood, Sonship, Savior, Creator) are intelligible only within the economy of revelation and the unity of the divine being.
 - Implications: affirms divine simplicity while defending genuine relational distinctions (economic Trinity) and locates the intelligibility of attributes in Christological and covenantal disclosure.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John Webster (honoree and shared theological orientation), patristic and Reformed sources for doctrinal continuity, selective engagement with modern analytic and philosophical theology as foil for corrective moves.
- **Doctrines treated:** The doctrine of God (attributes, simplicity), Trinity (immanent/economic distinction), Christology (grounding of relative predicates), revelation and theological method.
- **Closing line:** Swain's contribution centers theology on the self-revealing, Trinitarian God: attributes are neither mere abstract properties nor accidental addenda, but intelligible predicates because God, in Christ, discloses himself as one simple being in relational life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Recasts the absolute/relative distinction as essentially theological - not merely metaphysical taxonomy - insisting attributes receive their meaning from redemption-history and the Triune economy.
 - Stresses **Christological ground** for understanding divine predicates: the Son's relation to the Father fixes the way we speak of God's relational attributes.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects analytic tendencies that treat divine attributes as independent properties to be analyzed without reference to revelation.
 - Counters forms of theological minimalism that flatten relational language into metaphor by insisting on ontological seriousness for economic relations while maintaining divine simplicity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and reorients the use of "relative attributes" so that they are not subsidiary or merely derivative but constitutive of theological speech because of the economy.
 - Frames "theological theology" as a method that privileges Scripture-Trinity-Christology over purely philosophical theism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical scholarly circles as a careful reinvigoration of classic doctrines, useful for pastors and theologians defending biblical doctrine of God against reductionist accounts.
 - Contributes to ongoing debates between analytic theologians and constructive confessional theologians about proper method and categories.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a concise exemplar of how to integrate systematic, historical, and biblical theology on the doctrine of God.
 - Useful as a corrective resource in courses on divine attributes, the Trinity, and theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes:** Predicates of God that express perfections intrinsic to the divine essence (e.g., omnipotence, omniscience) - argued to be intelligible only within the economy of revelation.
- **Relative attributes:** Predicates expressing God's relations (e.g., Father, Son, Redeemer, Creator) - given theological weight as constitutive of how God is known.
- **Divine simplicity:** Doctrine affirmed and preserved; Swain insists simplicity must be held together with genuine relationality.
- **Economic Trinity:** The Trinitarian life as revealed in salvation-history; the primary locus where relative attributes become intelligible.
- **Immanent Trinity:** Distinguished but not elliptically insulated from economic relations; treated cautiously to avoid speculative separation.
- **Theological theology:** Methodological term emphasizing theology rooted in Scripture and the Triune revelation rather than extraneous philosophical frameworks.
- **Christocentric grounding:** The claim that the Son's identity and work are decisive for understanding God's attributes.
- **Revelation-centered predication:** The view that predicating attributes of God depends on God's self-disclosure rather than unaided human abstraction.
- **Analytic theology (contrast):** Contemporary philosophical approach treated as a useful interlocutor but critiqued when it abstracts attributes from revelation.
- **Perichoresis (implicit relation):** The intra-Trinitarian interpenetration that secures relational language without collapsing persons.
- **Covenantal language:** Employed to show how relational predicates arise from God's promises and acts.
- **Predicate theology:** The practice of ascribing predicates to God in a way that respects divine unity and economic relations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary treatments distinguishing absolute and relative attributes in confessional contexts.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist or overly philosophical accounts of divine predicates.
- As an **exegetical-model** for grounding attribute-talk in Scripture and Christology rather than abstract metaphysics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Methodist/Reformed teaching on how Trinitarian revelation reshapes systematic formulations.
