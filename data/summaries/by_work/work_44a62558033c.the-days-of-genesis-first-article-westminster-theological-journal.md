### TITLE
The Days of Genesis: First Article (E. J. Young, Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century conservative Reformed scholarship; Westminster Theological Journal as venue for confessional, exegetical engagement.
 - Young writing from the Westminster Seminary milieu that upheld scriptural inerrancy and the creedal First Article (God as Creator) against liberal and speculative readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1 should be read in its plain, grammatical-historical sense: the "days" are real, successive epochs (understood by Young as literal, 24-hour days) and the doctrine of creation (the First Article of the Creed) is non-negotiable for Christian orthodoxy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegetical analysis of Hebrew terms and syntax (especially yom + ordinal, and the formula "evening and morning").
 - Demonstration that ordinary linguistic usage and the narrative structure point to literal days rather than metaphorical or long ages.
 - Theological argument: affirming creation ex nihilo and divine fiat; linking the doctrine to soteriology and the authority of Scripture.
 - Polemical engagement: critique of alternative readings (day-age, gap theory, allegorical or purely mythic readings) that subordinate Scripture to contemporary science or non-literal hermeneutics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages traditionally with patristic (Augustine's non-literal tendencies noted), medieval, and modern interpreters.
 - Direct interlocutors include proponents of day-age and gap interpretations and modern critical scholars who read Genesis as theological myth or as non-historical.
 - Draws on Hebrew linguistics, comparative Semitic usage, and creedal formulations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, inerrancy, hermeneutics)
 - Creation (ex nihilo, divine fiat)
 - Providence and teleology implicit in a purposeful, ordered creation account
 - Indirectly touches on anthropology and Christology by way of grounding human creatureliness and covenantal theology in the Creator.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The Genesis days, rightly read, secure the First Article: a straightforward, historical-creedal doctrine of God as Creator is foundational to biblical faith and must govern both exegesis and theological reflection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp insistence on the grammatical-historical method as normative for Genesis interpretation; strong weighting of ordinary linguistic sense over speculative harmonizations with geology.
 - Integration of creedal theology (the First Article) into exegetical method: doctrine functions as a hermeneutical corrective rather than a mere afterthought.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that make Genesis dependent on external scientific narratives (old-earth or mythic readings), arguing they invert the proper authority of Scripture.
 - Contrasts with Augustine-derived allegorical tendencies and with contemporary critics who demote historicity.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reaffirms and clarifies the use of Hebrew category data (yom countenance) as determinative for temporal interpretation.
 - Treats "First Article" not only as creed summary but as exegetical presupposition shaping how Genesis is read.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a robust exegetical defense of literal days; often cited in later young-earth and conservative Old Testament studies.
 - Influenced seminary pedagogy at Westminster and other confessional institutions, shaping a generation of pastors and Old Testament scholars.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable model of confessional, text-focused argumentation: tight exegetical work tied to doctrinal commitments.
 - Continues to serve as a clear textbook example for those defending a literalist reading of Genesis and for discussions about the relation of science and Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **yom (Hebrew "day")**
 - Emphasis on its use with ordinals and the decisive function of context for temporal meaning.
- **"evening and morning" formula**
 - Presented as confirming successive 24-hour cycles in the narrative structure.
- **First Article**
 - Creedal anchor: God as Creator; used hermeneutically to constrain interpretation.
- **creation ex nihilo**
 - Affirmed as the theological core of Genesis 1 and necessary to avoid pantheistic or immanent readings.
- **divine fiat**
 - Emphasis on God speaking creation into existence; undergirds the priority of divine agency.
- **literal day (24-hour day)**
 - Young's preferred interpretation for the Genesis days; argued from grammar, context, and creedal commitments.
- **day-age theory**
 - Identified and critiqued as an accommodation that undermines Scripture's plain sense.
- **gap theory**
 - Treated as an artificial insertion to reconcile geology with text; rejected on exegetical grounds.
- **grammatical-historical method**
 - Methodological hallmark: the norm for valid interpretation in this essay.
- **hermeneutic of ordinary speech**
 - Principle: Scripture should be read according to ordinary linguistic usage unless compelling reasons exist.
- **inerrancy / authority of Scripture**
 - Presupposed and defended as necessary for legitimate theological and exegetical conclusions.
- **teleology in creation**
 - Implicit emphasis on purposeful ordering, opposing random or purely evolutionary explanations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for conservative readings of Genesis 1 (method + Hebrew evidence).
- As a **polemic resource** against day-age, gap, and non-historical interpretations.
- As a **definition source** in confessional teaching for grounding the First Article and linking creedal theology to biblical exegesis.
