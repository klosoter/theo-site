### TITLE
Order in the World: A Reflection on the Cultural Mandate and Its Implications (essays and lectures) 
Author: Al Wolters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed/intellectual tradition influenced by Neo-Calvinism and the Reformational philosophy movement (Kuyperian/Dooyeweerdian milieu). Addresses postwar concerns about Christian engagement with modern culture, the rise of secular specialization, and the recovery of a biblical doctrine of creation for cultural life.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The biblical **cultural mandate** (Gen. 1:26-28) establishes a God-given, ongoing vocation for humanity to order and develop creation; properly understood, this mandate supplies the theological foundation for all cultural spheres and disciplines and resists both privatized faith and Gnostic rejection of the created order.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical grounding in Genesis and Old Testament motifs of image-bearing and stewardship.
 - Theological articulation of **creation-order**: normative structures embedded in created reality that humans are commissioned to cultivate.
 - Anthropology of **vocation**: humans as called agents, not merely souls awaiting otherworldly destiny nor technicians of neutral culture.
 - Cultural implication: law, art, science, politics, economics, and education are legitimate arenas for Christian ordering work - distinct from sacerdotalizing them but binding to creation norms.
 - Practical corollaries: critique of simplistic sacred/secular dualisms, corrective to pietistic withdrawal and to triumphalist dominionism; call for disciplined cultural formation shaped by Scripture's creational and redemptive narrative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Abraham Kuyper (sphere sovereignty and common grace), Herman Dooyeweerd (structural norms), classic Reformed theologians (Calvinic stewardship), contemporary critics of cultural engagement (pietism, secular humanism), and social-scientific descriptions of modern specialization.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation and providence, imago Dei (anthropology), sin and fall (distortion of ordering), redemption (restoration of vocation), covenantal responsibility, and indirect treatment of ecclesiology and political theology through cultural implications.
- **Closing line:** Theological center of gravity - **the cultural mandate construed as a creational, vocational summons that grounds Christian responsibility to order, steward, and cultivate the world under God's normative will.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Elevates *order* and *normativity* within creation as theological categories central to cultural theology.
 - Treats vocation broadly: not merely professional calling or church ministry but the full array of cultural tasks instituted by God.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against privatizing pietism and forms of two‑kingdom separation that relegate culture to autonomous or illegitimate status.
 - Rejects triumphalist dominion theology that reads Genesis as license for coercive cultural monopolization; insists on stewardship, limits, and covenantal accountability.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses reformational/Dooyeweerdian language of *structural norms* and *ordering activity* to bridge Biblical exegesis and social analysis.
 - Frames cultural work as the ongoing enactment of created order, not merely social reform or moralization.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Reformed educational theory, Christian social ethics, and seminaries emphasizing vocation and worldview formation.
 - Served as a constructive resource for pastors and lay leaders seeking theological warrant for cultural engagement without capitulation to secular frameworks.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Offers a coherent framework for integrating doctrine of creation with praxis across disciplines; durable heuristic for teaching vocation, public theology, and Christian intellectual life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cultural mandate:** Genesis 1:26-28 as foundational commission to cultivate and rule creation responsibly.
- **Vocation:** God-ordained work of ordering creation; extends beyond ecclesial work to all callings.
- **Dominion:** Interpreted as stewardship/ordering, not domination or exploitation.
- **Creation-order / structural norms:** Intrinsic patterns and intelligibilities placed in creation that guide legitimate cultural activity.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Human capacity and responsibility to reflect God by ordering creation; grounds dignity and vocation.
- **Ordering activity:** Practical human work of structuring nature, institutions, and artifacts according to created norms.
- **Common grace:** Helps explain cultural achievements by nonbelievers without collapsing covenantal responsibility.
- **Two-kingdom tensions:** Critique of both strict separation and total absorption; offers a mediating account anchored in creation.
- **Sphere sovereignty (Kuyperian relation):** Affirmed insofar as spheres are legitimate arenas for ordering work, but disciplined by creation norms.
- **Redemption-as-restoration:** Redemption restores the capacity and calling to order creation rightly, not merely to secure personal salvation.
- **Worldview / conceptual framework:** Use of a biblical meta-narrative (creation-fall-redemption) to evaluate cultural goods.
- **Structural approach (Dooyeweerdian influence):** Analytical method to discern lawful relations within cultural practices.
- **Cultural formation:** Educational and institutional processes that inculcate ordering virtues and competencies.
- **Anti-gnostic posture:** Rejection of any theology that devalues material creation or cultural labor.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the theological concept of vocation and cultural mandate in systematic theology and ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Christian education, cultural criticism, and public theology to defend constructive cultural engagement rather than retreat or coercion.
- As an **exegetical model** linking Genesis 1-3 to contemporary cultural practice, informing curricula and catechesis on work and society.
