### TITLE
**"The Continuing Importance of the Covenant of Works" - Peter A. Lillback** 
(in The Law Is Not of Faith - essay defending the covenant-of-works locus within Reformed covenant theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed theological conversation: renewal of classical covenant theology amid challenges from antinomian readings, the New Perspective on Paul, and some evangelical neglect of covenantal categories.
 - Positioned inside a collected volume arguing for a robust theological role for the law in redemptive history.

- **Central thesis**
 - The covenant of works remains a necessary and non-negotiable category for biblical and systematic theology: it explains Adamic headship, the law's role prior to Christ, and grounds Christ's obedience as the meritorious ground of our justification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose the problem: contemporary weakenings of the covenant-of-works concept lead to confusion about law, grace, and Christ's representative obedience.
 - Historical-theological defense: trace the covenant-of-works doctrine through Scripture and classic Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster divines, later systematicians).
 - Theological function:
 - Explain Adam as federal head under a probationary covenant: condition (perfect obedience) - promise (life).
 - Show how covenant structure explains imputation, merit, and the necessity of a second Adam (Christ) as surety.
 - Pastoral and polemical application: reclaim covenant categories for preaching, catechesis, and polemic against both legalism and antinomianism.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Scriptural loci: Genesis 1-3, Romans 5, Galatians, key Pauline passages on Adam/Christ.
 - Historical voices: Calvin, Westminster Confession and Divines, Geerhardus Vos, Herman Bavinck, John Murray; contemporary interlocutors include antinomian critics and New Perspective exponents indirectly.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace)
 - Law (moral law, its role and binding force)
 - Christology (Christ as second Adam, surety, federal head)
 - Justification and imputation (merit of Christ's obedience)
 - Anthropology and original sin (federal headship of Adam)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Reaffirming the covenant of works preserves the coherence of redemptive-historical theology: it locates the law, clarifies Christ's federal obedience, and secures the doctrine of imputation against both legalism and antinomian erosion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that covenantal formalities (promise + condition) are not merely pedagogical but constitutive of Adamic administration; the covenant of works is ontologically and soteriologically significant.
 - Connects the covenant of works directly to pastoral practices: preaching law and gospel rightly depends on maintaining this category.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against approaches that dissolve Adam's representative role into generic human sinfulness or that treat the law as merely a moral guide rather than a covenantal condition.
 - Contrasts with views that overhistoricize or privatize the covenant concept; insists on its ongoing theological utility in systematic and biblical theology.

- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Rehabilitates classical Reformed vocabulary (federal headship, surety, obedience-imputation) and insists these are not antiquarian but explanatory tools for contemporary debates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Receives affirmation in conservative Reformed academic and pastoral circles as a corrective to antinomian tendencies and to certain readings of Paul that minimize covenantal categories.
 - Used as a resource in seminary teaching on covenant theology, and in polemical contexts against both New Perspective readings and lax views of the law.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, usable defense of a foundational Reformed doctrine that helps unify biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - The prelapsarian covenant between God and Adam with condition (perfect obedience) and promise (life); explanatory core of federal theology.
- **Covenant of Grace** - The postfall covenant founded on promise and fulfilled in Christ; contrasted with covenant of works but continuous in redemptive history.
- **Federal Headship** - The representative role of Adam (and Christ as Second Adam); grounds corporate imputation of sin and righteousness.
- **Imputation** - The accounting of Adam's sin to his posterity and of Christ's obedience to believers; central to justification.
- **Adamic Probation** - The notion that Adam was placed under a covenantal test with real life-and-death consequences; explains culpability and covenant failure.
- **Surety** - Christ as the one who legally and covenantally stands in place of believers, accomplishing what Adam failed to do.
- **Law (Covenantal/Moral)** - Treated as covenantal condition (not merely moralism); moral law retains normative force and typological function.
 - Sub-note: Differentiated from ceremonial/civil orders but integrated into covenantal schema.
- **Merit / Obediential Merit** - Christ's obedience viewed as meritorious in a covenantal, not purely forensic, sense; secures life for believers.
- **Typology (Adam/Christ)** - Adam as type of Christ; establishes the theological symmetry on which redemption is built.
- **Works-Righteousness** - The error opposed by Lillback; the covenant of works is not advocated as human salvation plan but as historical-theological category explaining the need for Christ.
- **Penal/Substitutionary Schema** - Implicitly connected: covenant categories help make sense of penal substitution and satisfaction.
- **Covenant Administration** - How covenants are enacted historically; relevant to preaching and catechesis.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** in systematic treatments of covenant theology and federal headship.
- As a **polemic** tool against antinomianism, legalism, and readings that downplay Adamic federalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for Genesis 1-3 and Pauline Adam-Christ typology (especially Romans 5).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology and catechesis to restore law/gospel clarity.
