### TITLE
**Biblical Foundations for Baptist Churches - John S. Hammett**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written from a late-20th/early-21st century conservative evangelical Baptist vantage point.
 - Situated within renewed interest in New Testament ecclesiology among Baptists and conservative Protestants; addressing intra-evangelical debates over polity, baptism, and covenant theology.
 - Aimed at pastors, seminary students, and informed lay leaders seeking a biblical defense of historic Baptist practice.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The local, regenerate, believer's church governed congregationally and practicing believer's baptism is the form of church life grounded in Scripture and faithful to the New Testament pattern.
 - Corresponding problem: defending Baptist distinctives against paedobaptist, episcopal, and certain merger-of-covenants models that subsume local church boundaries or infant inclusion.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scriptural exegesis of key New Testament texts on church nature and practice (e.g., Acts, Pastoral Epistles, teaching on baptism and discipline).
 - Doctrinal synthesis drawing theological conclusions about membership, baptism, polity, ministry, and ordinances.
 - Practical application: implications for congregational life, discipline, mission, and pastoral ministry.
 - Major moves:
 - Define the church by its covenantal/regenerate character rather than ethnic or familial ties.
 - Argue for believer's baptism as the visible initiation rite corresponding to saving faith.
 - Ground congregational authority and local autonomy in New Testament examples and principles.
 - Clarify offices (elders/pastors, deacons) and the church's exercise of discipline and membership covenants.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocution with paedobaptist and covenant-theology traditions (Presbyterian, Reformed, Anglican), as well as with other Baptist traditions.
 - Engages contemporary evangelical ecclesiologists and classic Baptist confessional sources; depends heavily on biblical texts and standard historical-theological material.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation / scriptural authority as the basis for polity.
 - Ecclesiology (nature and marks of the church, membership).
 - Sacramentology (baptism and Lord's Supper) - treated as ordinances.
 - Church government (congregational polity, eldership, diaconate).
 - Discipline, mission, and the relationship between church and state/society.
 - Interaction with covenant theology and its implications for baptism and membership.

- **Closing line**
 - A sustained biblical case that the New Testament envisions local, regenerate, believer-baptized congregations exercising congregational authority under Christ - a blueprint for Baptist churches.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained insistence on **regenerate church membership** as normative; membership is an evidentiary, covenantal marker rather than an inclusive social category.
 - Tight linkage of **baptism to personal faith** and church membership; baptism is the visible initiation of those already converted.
 - Scriptural warrant for **congregational decision-making** coupled with an operative role for elders, not a weak or purely advisory eldership.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Systematic critique of covenantal infant baptism that collapses household inclusion into ecclesial membership without personal faith.
 - Challenges hierarchical or territorial models (episcopal, state-church) that displace local autonomy and regenerate boundaries.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies usage of "ordinance" vs. "sacrament" to resist sacramentalist readings that imply baptism or the Lord's Supper as automatic means of grace.
 - Develops language of **membership covenant** to describe the commitments of local believers together.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in conservative Baptist and evangelical seminary settings as a clear defense of Baptist polity.
 - Influential in pastoral training and denominational debates over membership, baptismal practice, and church discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear exegetical work on pastoral/act passages and a practical hermeneutic for applying New Testament church patterns to contemporary congregational life.
 - Useful bridge between rigorous biblical theology and pragmatic pastoral implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Believer's baptism**
 - Baptism administered to those who profess faith; initiatory sign of the regenerate membership of the local church.
- **Regenerate church membership**
 - Membership limited to professing believers; a covenantal community of the converted.
- **Congregational polity**
 - Local church self-governance under Christ, exercised corporately by the membership.
- **Local church autonomy**
 - Each congregation possesses authority in matters of membership, discipline, and leadership absent external ecclesiastical sovereignty.
- **Elder / overseer / pastor**
 - Biblical leadership office; Hammett typically affirms a plurality model in which elders shepherd and teach under congregational oversight.
- **Deacon**
 - Service office distinct from eldership; focused on practical care and administration.
- **Ordinances**
 - Baptism and the Lord's Supper as commanded practices that witness to gospel realities without functioning as sacramental means of justification.
- **Church discipline**
 - The communal practice of restoration and purity; a mark of faithful congregational life.
- **Membership covenant**
 - Explicit commitments members make to one another and to the church's covenantal life.
- **Covenant theology (critique)**
 - Critical engagement with paedobaptist covenant models that justify infant baptism and non-regenerate membership.
- **New Testament pattern**
 - Hermeneutical principle treating the descriptive data of Acts/letters as normative for church structure and practice.
- **Priesthood of all believers**
 - Theological underpinning for congregational involvement and accountability.
- **Scriptural authority**
 - Foundational commitment: ecclesial structures must be accountable to biblical teaching.
- **Mission and evangelism**
 - Corporate responsibility of local churches; baptism as integrative act for converts.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Baptist ecclesiology and membership practice.
 - As a **polemic** against paedobaptist and hierarchical models.
 - As an **exegetical/practical model** for reading New Testament church passages and shaping congregational policy.
