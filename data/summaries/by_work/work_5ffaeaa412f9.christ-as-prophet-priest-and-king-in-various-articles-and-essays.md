### TITLE
**Christ as Prophet, Priest, and King** - Vern Poythress (essays / articles on the Munus Triplex)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical theological milieu (late 20th-21st century). Poythress writes from a Westminster/Reformed framework, combining rigorous biblical-theological exegesis with analytic philosophy of language and typology; material appears across essays, lectures, and journal articles rather than a single monograph.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The threefold office (munus triplex) - Prophet, Priest, King - is a coherent, unified way to describe Christ's mediatorial work: he reveals God, atones for sinners, and rules the covenant people. These offices are distinct in function but inseparable in the one person of the Son.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: careful reading of OT types (Moses, the prophets, the Aaronic priesthood, Davidic kingship) and NT fulfillment texts (Hebrews, the Gospels, Pauline and Johannine materials).
 - Conceptual clarification: define each office in relation to mediation - **Prophet = divine revelation and interpretation**, **Priest = substitutionary atonement and representation**, **King = covenantal governance and vindication**.
 - Integrative move: show functional overlap and simultaneous exercise of offices (e.g., Christ speaks as King, intercedes as Priest, interprets law as Prophet), grounded in Trinitarian relations and the covenant of redemption.
 - Practical implications: ecclesiology, preaching, sacraments, and pastoral ministry inherit and reflect the threefold office.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Westminster standards), patristic and medieval tradition on munus triplex, modern biblical scholarship (Hebrews commentators, typology-focused scholars). Poythress also engages analytic philosophy of language to treat revelation and proclamation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, Revelation, Covenant (including covenant of redemption), Atonement, Ecclesiology, Sacraments, Typology, Trinitarian relations.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity: Christ is the single Mediator who simultaneously functions as Prophet, Priest, and King - each distinct office illuminates a facet of his one saving work and anchors covenantal theology, worship, and pastoral practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the *communicative* dimension of the prophetic office - revelation as speech-act grounded in the Word (logos) who is Christ.
 - Careful semantic and typological linking between OT offices and NT fulfillment; not merely moralized or spiritualized fulfillment but covenantal and representative.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters reductionist or sequential schemes that treat the offices as temporally successive rather than contemporaneous and mutually implicative.
 - Pushes back against modern tendencies to privatize Christ's kingly rule (merely personal piety) by reasserting public, covenantal, juridical dominion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of philosophy of language to explicate prophecy as authoritative divine speech mediated by the Son.
 - Emphasis on the interpenetration of offices (e.g., kingly judgement expressed prophetically; priestly intercession enacted as kingly vindication).
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in Reformed seminaries and pulpits as a concise, exegetically grounded treatment of munus triplex. Influential among pastors for preaching frameworks and in systematic theology classrooms for linking covenant theology to practical ministry.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact bridge between biblical exegesis, doctrinal formulation, and pastoral application; durable pedagogical resource for teaching Christ's mediatorial roles.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus triplex (threefold office):** Classical rubric for Prophet, Priest, King; Poythress treats it as hermeneutical key for Christ's mediation.
- **Prophet:** Christ as revelator and interpreter; authoritative speech-act, fulfiller of prophetic typology (Moses, prophets).
 - Emphasis on revelation as linguistic/communicative event (logos-centered).
- **Priest:** Christ as representative/mediator who atones (offering, sacrifice, intercession); Hebrews is primary locus.
- **King:** Christ as covenantal ruler and judge; Davidic typology and inaugurated eschatology stressed.
- **Mediator:** Unifying term - the one who reconciles, reveals, and rules between God and humanity.
- **Covenant of redemption:** Intra-Trinitarian pact that grounds the offices as ordered roles in the plan of salvation.
- **Typology:** OT persons and institutions as foreshadows; careful criteria for typological fulfillment.
- **Representation:** Legal and relational standing of Christ as substitute for the elect (priestly and kingly dimensions).
- **Atonement:** Penal-substitutionary, vicariant in Poythress's reading; also tied to priestly intercession and kingly vindication.
- **Revelation (Word/logos):** Central to prophetic office; Christ as both the content and agent of divine speech.
- **Intercession:** Ongoing priestly function in heaven; pastoral and liturgical implications.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** Kingdom "already/not yet" articulation applied to kingly office.
- **Typological hermeneutic:** Method for linking OT structures to Christ's offices without collapsing particularities.
- **Ecclesial implications:** Church ministry, sacraments, preaching inherit Christ's threefold work.
- **Office (munus) language:** Used both descriptively (what Christ does) and normatively (how church orders ministry).
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for teaching the threefold office in systematic theology and catechesis.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking OT types to NT fulfillment, especially Hebrews and the Gospels.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** connecting Christology to ecclesiology, preaching, and sacramental theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against bifurcated or privatized accounts of Christ's rule and ministry.
