### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th‑century Reformed theological context; Frame writes from a conservative Presbyterian standpoint shaped by Van Tilian presuppositionalism but developing his own methodological emphases.
 - Engages both systematic theology and apologetics, addressing philosophers and Reformed interlocutors; written during a period of renewed interest in epistemology within evangelical theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Knowledge of God is primarily revelatory and relational: true knowledge of God comes from God's self‑disclosure (chiefly in Scripture and supremely in Christ) and functions as the normative ground for all other knowledge.
 - Epistemological disputes (evidentialism vs. presuppositionalism; natural theology vs. special revelation) hinge on how one conceives Scripture, general revelation, and the nature of faith.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes kinds of knowledge: natural/general knowledge of God (via creation and conscience), propositional knowledge (Scripture), and personal/saving knowledge (faith and union with Christ).
 - Defends the priority of the Word (Scripture) as the *norming norm* for knowledge claims while acknowledging genuine information in general revelation and common grace.
 - Argues that epistemology must be theological: God's knowledge and revelation set the standards for human knowing; human knowing is covenantal and responsive, not purely autonomous.
 - Applies the doctrine to loci: bibliology (authority and propositional content of Scripture), theology proper (knowability of God, Trinity), Christology (Christ as the decisive revelation), anthropology (imago Dei and human knowing), soteriology (faith as knowing/trusting), and ecclesiology (means of grace as epistemic vehicles).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed thinkers: Cornelius Van Til (critical affinity), Bavinck, Warfield; also engages Barthian critiques of natural theology, classical evidentialists, and contemporary epistemologists (discussed functionally rather than at length by name).
 - Uses biblical exegesis, creedal material, and analytic categories to bridge theology and philosophy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Scripture (bibliology), Trinity (God's knowability and persons), Christology (Christ as Revealer), Anthropology (imago Dei, psychosomatic unity), Soteriology (faith as knowledge/trust), Ecclesiology and Sacraments (means of knowing God), Apologetics/theological method.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame locates the knowledge of God squarely in God's self‑revelation-Scriptural, incarnational, covenantal-thereby making theology itself the primary discipline for understanding human knowing.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence that epistemology is theological: knowledge must be evaluated by God's self‑revelation; human reason is not neutral.
 - Balances Van Tilian presuppositionalism with a distinctly pastoral and systematic concern for biblical categories (e.g., covenantal relations, means of grace).
 - Emphasizes both propositional content of Scripture and relational/experiential knowing (faith is knowledge that trusts).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - More hospitable to the idea that general revelation provides genuine, non‑saving knowledge than some strict presuppositionalists.
 - Avoids reductionist fideism by affirming rationality and propositional truth while denying autonomous epistemic starting points.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Uses covenantal language to frame epistemic relations (knowing as covenantal encounter).
 - Deploys a coherent, theologically anchored critique of autonomous reason without abandoning analytic clarity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed circles as a go‑to for bibliology and theological epistemology; has shaped conservative evangelical teaching on revelation and apologetics.
 - Influential among pastors and teachers who want to integrate doctrine and epistemology; noted by scholars for refining presuppositional themes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, systematic model linking revelation, doctrine, and human knowing-helpful for teaching bibliology, apologetics, and pastoral epistemology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation (General vs. Special)** - General = knowledge of God in creation/conscience; Special = redemptive self‑disclosure in Scripture and Christ; both genuine but different in function.
- **Scripture as the Norming Norm** - Scripture supplies propositional content that governs all true knowledge claims.
- **Faith (Knowledge + Trust)** - Faith is cognitive (knowing certain truths) and volitional/relational (trusting the Revealer).
- **Presuppositionalism (Theological Epistemology)** - The claim that God's truth is the necessary starting point for coherent knowledge; Frame nuances Van Til's approach.
- **Covenantal Epistemology** - Knowing framed as a covenantal relation between God and creatures, not merely abstract belief.
- **Christ as Revealer / Munus Triplex** - Christ's offices (priest, prophet, king) function in epistemic roles: prophet = revelation, priest = mediation/assurance, king = governance for life and knowledge.
- **Analogy and Knowability of God** - Uses analogical language to affirm genuine (but creaturely) knowledge of God; rejects both equivocal unknowability and univocal assimilation.
- **Imago Dei & Psychosomatic Unity** - Human knowing rooted in created, embodied persons made in God's image (integral unity of body and soul affects epistemology).
- **Traducianism vs. Creationism (brief)** - Discusses soul origin in relation to human identity and knowledge capacities; argues from scriptural and theological considerations rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Common Grace / General Revelation** - Affirms non‑saving truth and rationality granted by God that enables cultural life and partial knowledge.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **bibliology** reference for the status and propositional nature of Scripture and the relation of general revelation to Scripture.
- As an **apologetic and methodological** pivot against evidentialism and for theological epistemology (useful in polemics).
- As an **exegetical and pastoral** model linking doctrine (Trinity, Christ) to modes of knowing in preaching, sacraments, and Christian life.
