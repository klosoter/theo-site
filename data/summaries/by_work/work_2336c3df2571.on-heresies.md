### TITLE
**On Heresies** - John of Damascus (8th century; often titled Adversus Haereses)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 7th to mid-8th century, Syrian/Byzantine monastic milieu under Islamic rule; John is a Chalcedonian monk and systematic theologian reacting to enduring Christological controversies and rising popular deviations.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To catalogue and refute past and contemporary false teachings so as to defend orthodox Christian doctrine, especially the correct understanding of Christ's person and natures.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organized as a survey: lists heretical sects, summarizes their creeds, and provides refutation based on Scripture, patristic tradition, and philosophical categories.
 - Major moves:
 - Historical catalogue of heresies from early Gnosticism to contemporary Monophysitism and Islam.
 - Clarification of technical terms (ousia, hypostasis, physis) to secure correct Christological formulas.
 - Positive construction of orthodoxy by demonstrating coherence with earlier fathers and with correct philosophical distinctions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages earlier Fathers (Athanasius, Cyril, Gregory), the Council of Chalcedon formulations, Nestorian and Monophysite defenders, and Islamic critiques in passing.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: **Christology** (personhood and natures), Trinity (per definition and against Arianism), soteriology as connected to Christ's twofold nature.
 - Secondary: revelation, ecclesiology (as authority for orthodoxy), and polemics against non-Christian teachings.
- **Christological emphases (site references)**
 - Upholds the **Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine** as normative, insisting on "two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably" (see Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
 - Employs and defends the **Hypostatic Union** language to explain the union of divine and human in the one Person (see Hypostatic Union).
 - Articulates how properties pass between natures (the communicatio idiomatum) without confusion of essences (see Communicatio Idiomatum).
- **Closing line**
 - On Heresies functions as a compact manual of orthodox apologetics: definitional clarity plus polemic, aimed at preserving the identity of the incarnate Word as both God and man.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Systematic, encyclopedic cataloguing of heresies with succinct refutations - blending historical summary with philosophical precision.
 - Strong insistence on technical distinctions (hypostasis vs. ousia; physis as nature) to prevent equivocation in Christological debate.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Clarifies misunderstandings of Cyril and Nestorius by distinguishing "person" (hypostasis) from "nature" (physis), thus correcting both Nestorian over-separation and Monophysite fusion.
 - Rejects simplistic identification of divine and human attributes; insists on communicatio idiomatum without ontological confusion.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes consistent use of Greek philosophical terminology for ecclesial doctrinal argument in a compact polemical format.
 - Models a pedagogic sequence: identify, locate historically, quote, refute - useful for later manualists.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Eastern Orthodox theology as a reliable handbook; used by Byzantine theologians and later medieval Latin scholastics for historical summaries.
 - In Reformed circles: valued historically for patristic witness to Chalcedon and for clarifying Christological language, though not a primary confessional source.
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches precise conceptual distinctions vital for teaching Christology and for confronting persistent heretical tendencies; serves as both polemic and primer for advanced students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Haeresis** - any deviant teaching; John catalogs and refutes dozens as a method of boundary-setting.
- **Ousia (essence, nature)** - what a thing is; used to distinguish the natures of Christ.
- **Hypostasis (person, subsistence)** - who a thing is; central term for affirming one Person (the Word) in whom two natures subsist.
- **Physis (nature)** - often used interchangeably with ousia in popular speech; John insists on technical distinctions to avoid confusion of Christ's human/divine natures.
- **Prosopon (face/persona)** - relates to how a person appears; John navigates prosopon language to avoid implying two persons in Christ.
- **Dyophysitism / Two Natures Doctrine** - affirmation that Christ has two complete natures, divine and human, preserved and united; John defends this as orthodox (see Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine).
- **Hypostatic Union** - the real personal union of divine and human in the one hypostasis of the Word; John uses this to reject both separation and mixture (see Hypostatic Union).
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - the transfer or attribution of properties of each nature to the one Person without confusion; John explains limits and correct application (see Communicatio Idiomatum).
- **Nestorianism** - overemphasis on separateness of persons; John refutes by insisting on one hypostasis.
- **Monophysitism / Eutychianism** - tendency to fuse or absorb natures; John opposes such blending and defends distinction.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)** - used more of Trinitarian relations but informs his reversible talk of relational union in Christ.
- **Polemic method** - short quotation of opponents followed by scriptural/patristic refutation; pedagogical and juridical in tone.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: concise statement of orthodox distinctions that buttress Chalcedonian teaching.
 - As **polemic**: model for refuting Christological errors (Nestorian, Monophysite) and for inter-religious rebuttal.
 - As an **exegetical and pedagogical model**: instructs ministers and students in precise term-use for Christology and doctrine.
