### TITLE
Divinity and Humanity: The Incarnation Reconsidered - Oliver D. Crisp

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic-theological engagement (early 21st century). Part of a wider reappraisal of classical Christology using tools from analytic metaphysics and philosophy of religion.
 - Situated against both traditional patristic/medieval accounts (Athanasius, Chalcedon, Aquinas) and modern proposals (various kenotic and revisionary models).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Reconsiders how the divine and human belong together in the one person of Jesus Christ such that Chalcedonian commitments (one person, two natures) are preserved while clarifying the metaphysical vehicles that make the union intelligible.
 - Seeks to solve tensions between ascriptions of divine properties (immutability, impassibility, omniscience) and the evident change, suffering, and ignorance in the human Jesus.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Analytic reconstruction of classical categories: distinguishes precisely between person (hypostasis) and nature (physis), and examines how properties are ascribable to each.
 - Critiques simplistic applications of divine attributes to the incarnate subject; argues for a nuanced account of property-bearers and the logic of predication in the incarnation.
 - Evaluates rival models:
 - Rejection of Apollinarian and simple reductionist models that collapse human natures into the divine mind.
 - Critical engagement with kenotic proposals that posit substantial divine self-emptying in ways that threaten divine immutability or impassibility.
 - Proposes a defensible metaphysical framework (drawing on contemporary metaphysics of constitution, part/whole talk, and personhood) that secures genuine human experiences and divine identity without incoherence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary classical touchstones: Chalcedon, Athanasius, Cyril, and Thomistic resources.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: analytic theologians and philosophers of religion working on the incarnation and divine attributes (critique and conversation with kenotic theorists and with those defending traditional divine impassibility).
 - Uses philosophical tools from metaphysics of properties, constitution, and persistence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, two natures, person of the Son)
 - Trinity (implications for the Son's divine identity)
 - Divine attributes (immutability, impassibility, omniscience)
 - Communication of properties (communicatio idiomatum)
 - Implications for soteriology and atonement are discussed insofar as they presuppose the reality of the human/divine union.

- **Closing line**
 - The work aims to preserve the theological integrity of Chalcedonian Christology by retooling its metaphysical underpinnings: the Son is truly God and truly human in one person, and a careful analytic account can make that paradox intelligible without surrendering either divine identity or genuine humanity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological: rigorous use of contemporary analytic metaphysics to clarify classical doctrinal grammar.
 - Pastoral-theological sensitivity to the reality of Jesus' human limitations and experiences while guarding divine aseity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects kenotic models that overemphasize divine self-limitation and thereby risk losing classical divine perfections.
 - Contrasts with Apollinarian and reductionist tendencies by insisting on a genuine, ontologically robust human nature in Christ.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes refined distinctions between kinds of property-bearers and the logics of predication so that divine and human predicates cohere when attributed to a single personal subject.
 - Employs "constitution" and "person-nature" analytic schemata to reframe communicatio idiomatum without collapsing categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely engaged in analytic Christology and by Reformed scholars interested in conserving Chalcedon within contemporary philosophical frameworks.
 - Useful as a corrective to both conservative literalists and revisionary kenotics; increasingly cited in seminaries and analytic-theology syllabi.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for integrating classical theology with current metaphysical resources.
 - Offers durable conceptual tools for teaching Christology in philosophically informed contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostasis / Person**
 - The subject (the Son) who bears both divine and human natures; central locus of predication.

- **Physis / Nature**
 - The ontological constituents whose properties are predicated; Crisp insists on separating nature-level properties from person-level ascriptions.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Classical doctrine of property attribution; reinterpreted with analytic clarity about how predicates transfer across natures in one person.

- **Divine immutability**
 - Treated as a weighty classical commitment; Crisp explores how immutability can be preserved without denying the Son's assumptive change in human nature.

- **Divine impassibility**
 - Likewise defended in careful balance with the reality of Christ's suffering: human passibility does not straightforwardly entail divine passibility.

- **Kenosis / self-emptying**
 - Critically assessed; Crisp resists readings that posit ontological diminution of the divine being.

- **Apollinarianism**
 - Rejected as a threat to Christ's genuine humanity; Crisp affirms full human rationality and soul.

- **Property-bearer / predicate logic**
 - Technical analytic tools used to track attribution of properties to person vs nature.

- **Constitution**
 - Employed as a metaphysical model for how human nature and person relate without simple identity or composition that erases distinctiveness.

- **Analytic Christology**
 - The methodological genre Crisp exemplifies: precise argumentation, conceptual clarification, and engagement with philosophical metaphysics.

- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary explication of Chalcedonian commitments.
 - As a **polemic** resource against reductionist kenotic or Apollinarian moves.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating biblical Christology with analytic metaphysics in teaching and research.
