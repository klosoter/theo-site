### TITLE
By Faith Alone: Answering the Challenges to the Doctrine of Justification (2007) - contribution by Guy Prentiss Waters

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-2000s Reformed/evangelical defensive project amid renewed controversies over justification arising from:
 - Roman Catholic ecumenical conversations and Trent-era critiques.
 - New Perspective on Paul debates.
 - The rise of *Federal Vision* controversies (including monocovenantalism and claims about covenantal participation).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** defense of classical Reformed *sola fide* - that sinners are justified before God by faith alone on the basis of the imputed righteousness of Christ - against proposals that relativize forensic declaration in favor of covenantal participation, sacramental efficacy, or works-oriented definitions of covenant fidelity.
- **Core argument or structure:** (Waters' contribution situated within the volume)
 - exegetical vindication of Pauline language of justification as forensic/ declarative.
 - systematic linkage of justification to imputation (not merely to covenantal incorporation or covenant blessings).
 - polemical engagement with Federal Vision variants that emphasize ongoing covenantal union, baptismal efficacy, and monocovenantal frameworks in ways that, Waters argues, confuse justification and sanctification.
 - pastoral and confessional implications: assurance, sacramental practice, and pastoral preaching of justification by faith alone.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Classical Reformers (e.g., Calvin, Luther) as normative reference points.
 - Roman Catholic objections deriving from Trent and contemporary Catholic theologians.
 - New Perspective interlocutors (Sanders, Dunn, Wright) insofar as they reshape Paul.
 - **Federal Vision proponents** and the cluster of issues identifiable as *Federal Vision Monocovenantalism* and *Federal Vision And Justification By Faith* (both topics addressed in this volume and engaged explicitly by Waters and other contributors).
- **Doctrines treated:** justification (forensic declaration, imputation), covenant theology (covenant of grace vs. covenant of works), union with Christ, sanctification, sacraments (baptism and the Lord's Supper), assurance, Christology (righteousness of Christ as ground of justification), soteriology broadly.
- **Closing line:** The volume - and Waters' essay within it - reaffirms that biblical and Reformed orthodoxy locate our right standing with God in the forensic imputation of Christ's righteousness received by faith alone, rejecting accounts that collapse justification into covenantal participation or sacramental efficacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the forensic/declarative language of justification as non-negotiable for evangelical and Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Clarifies relation between union with Christ and imputation: union grounds application but does not eliminate the forensic character of justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Federal Vision tendencies that, according to Waters, substitute a primarily covenantal or participatory vocabulary for the forensic categories central to Pauline theology.
 - Contrasts with New Perspective moves that redefine justification in communal or covenantal terms without adequate attention to imputation and penal substitution.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful analytic distinction between *covenantal membership* and *forensic acquittal* - arguing that many contemporary confusions stem from collapsing those categories.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles as a concise, pastoral, and confessional rebuttal to Federal Vision claims and contemporary revisionist readings of Paul.
 - Used by pastors, seminary faculty, and denominational committees in debates over doctrine and sacramental practice.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, multi-disciplinary resource combining exegesis, dogmatics, and pastoral theology for defending classical doctrines of justification and imputation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** forensic declaration by God that the sinner is righteous on Christ's account; central term defended throughout.
- **Sola fide:** faith alone as the instrumental means of receiving Christ's righteousness; reaffirmed as confessional standard.
- **Imputation:** the accounting of Christ's active and passive obedience to believers; insisted upon as the ground of justification.
- **Forensic/declarative language:** terminology emphasizing legal declaration over moral transformation as the essence of justification.
- **Union with Christ:** relational/ontological bond that grounds application of benefits but does not replace forensic declaration.
- **Covenant (monocovenantalism):**
 - Federal Vision variant stressing the unity/continuity of covenant administration; critiqued where it obscures forensic justification.
- **Sanctification:** progressive renewal distinguished from justification; conflation with justification is a key error identified.
- **Sacramental efficacy:** claims about baptism/communion effecting justification are tested and constrained by forensic categories.
- **Penal substitution:** Christ's penal bearing of sins defended as compatible with and necessary for imputation and forensic acquittal.
- **Assurance:** pastoral corollary; assurance rests on declared righteousness, not merely on covenantal markers or habitus.
- **Merit and works:** works are treated as fruit and evidence, not as ground of justification.
- **Declarative righteousness vs. participatory righteousness:** contrast clarified to show differing soteriological implications.
- **Ecumenical critiques:** Roman Catholic objections and Trent-era formulations engaged and answered within Reformed confessional parameters.
- **New Perspective dialogues:** Pauline exegesis engaged where it affects the definition of justification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and confessional defense against Federal Vision monocovenantal tendencies and sacramental conflations.
- As an **exegetical-model** exemplar defending forensic readings of Paul while integrating covenant theology and pastoral concerns.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: for linking imputation, union with Christ, and pastoral assurance within Reformed soteriology.
