### TITLE
**Common Grace (Collected Articles)** - Abraham Kuyper

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Neo-Calvinism; serialized in church and political newspapers (e.g., De Heraut, De Standaard), later compiled in multi-volume form.
 - Written during Kuyper s leadership in church renewal and public life (Free University, Anti-Revolutionary politics).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How to affirm total depravity and particular redemption while accounting for real goodness, order, knowledge, and culture among the unregenerate.
 - Thesis: **Common grace** is God s non-saving favor that preserves the fallen world, restrains sin, distributes gifts, and enables cultural development for the sake of special grace and the kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Creation grace and the cultural mandate endure after the fall; the image of God is marred but operative.
 - **Noahic covenant** as juridical ground for a preserved order: seasons, family, justice, vocation (Gen 8-9).
 - **Providence and restraint:** Spirit and law (conscience, magistracy) curb sin; civic righteousness is real though not meritorious.
 - **Common vs special grace:** Distinct yet coordinated; common grace serves the economy of redemption and the gathering of the church.
 - **Sphere sovereignty:** God ordains differentiated creational spheres (family, church, state, science, art) with proper laws and competencies.
 - **Church institute and organism:** Institute administers Word and sacrament; organism diffuses Christian life into culture.
 - **Christ s kingship:** Christ rules all, not only the church; politics, science, and art stand under his lordship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Augustine, Calvin, classic Reformed orthodoxy; Romans 1-2; 13; Acts 14; Genesis 1; 8-9.
 - In debate: Anabaptist withdrawalism; Lutheran two-kingdoms formulations; Roman Catholic nature-grace schema; Enlightenment liberalism and Kantian autonomy; Arminian synergism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology proper and providence:** divine patience, goodness, and governance.
 - **Anthropology and creation:** imago Dei, cultural mandate, natural gifts.
 - **Hamartiology:** total depravity in principle; restraint in effect.
 - **Soteriology:** monergistic special grace; regeneration and faith distinct from common endowments.
 - **Covenant theology:** Noahic covenant as common order; relation to redemptive covenants.
 - **Eschatology:** non-utopian hope; cultural life continues under Christ until consummation.
- **Center of gravity**
 - God s universal lordship: **grace restoring nature without abolishing it**, so that preserved creation can serve redemption and anticipate the kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong articulation of the **Noahic-civic order** as theological category.
 - **Sphere sovereignty** safeguarding differentiated social life under God.
 - **Institute/organism** distinction of the church enabling whole-life discipleship.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **pietist/Anabaptist retreat**: cultural engagement is mandated and graced.
 - Against **Lutheran two-kingdoms reduction**: sharper integration under Christ s one kingship, yet retaining institutional differentiation.
 - Against **Roman nature-grace dualism**: grace renews nature; it does not add a second ontological tier.
 - Against **liberal optimism**: culture needs redemption; common grace does not save.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Terminic sharpening of **common grace** vs **special grace**; **antithesis** alongside cooperation in civic life.
 - Development of **civic righteousness** and **common operations of the Spirit** without compromising sola gratia.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed the **1924 CRC Three Points of Common Grace**; contested by Hoeksema and the Protestant Reformed Churches.
 - Shaped **Bavinck** (with more cautions), **Van Til** (antithesis), and **Dooyeweerd/Vollenhoven** (philosophy of the law-idea).
 - Seeds for Kuyperian institutions in education, politics, and the arts; ongoing dialogue with Reformed two-kingdoms advocates.
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable framework for **Christian public theology**, clarifying how believers cooperate with and differ from nonbelievers across culture while confessing sovereign grace.
