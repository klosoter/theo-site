### TITLE
The Problem of War and Peace (essay) - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Reformed milieu; post-Enlightenment and rising modern nationalism; Bavinck writes within a confessional Reformed academy reacting to secularizing political theories, the expansion of state power, and growing debates over modern warfare and international order.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** War must be situated within a theodical framework: as a consequence of the Fall and human sin it is real and tragic, yet it can be morally regulated by divine law and the office of civil government. Christian theology must therefore condemn gratuitous violence while recognizing limited, justice-oriented uses of force under God's providence.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose: war emerges from disorder caused by sin; it is not ontologically divine but permitted within providence.
 - Normative grounding: Scripture, natural law, and covenantal theology supply criteria for judging wars.
 - Ethical taxonomy: distinguishes between unlawful violence, legitimate self-defense, and public justice enacted by the magistrate.
 - Practical application: affirms restraints (justice, proportionality, legitimate authority) and insists on Christian temperance, charity, and pursuit of peace.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Appeals to Scripture broadly (OT warfare; New Testament ethic), draws implicitly on Augustine and scholastic just-war elements, dialogues with Reformed authorities (Calvinian magistrate theory), and counters both pacifist absolutism and uncritical militarism; also appeals to natural law and Grotius-style public order.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Revelation:** Scripture as normative for moral judgments about war.
 - **Covenant:** public covenantal responsibility of magistrates to maintain justice and peace.
 - **Trinity:** divine sovereignty and providence undergird the ordering of nations and historical events.
 - **Christology:** Christ as the Prince of Peace and Lord whose reconciliation sets the telos for social ordering; his lordship limits the legitimacy of violence.
 - **Providence, sin, common grace, law:** all operative in explaining why God permits and governs the use of force.
- **Closing line:** Bavinck locates war within a fallen world ordered by God's providence and law: it is a tragic, sometimes necessary instrument of justice that must always be judged and constrained by the gospel, the covenantal responsibility of magistrates, and the ultimate rule of Christ as peacemaker.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates theodicy with political ethics: war is treated not merely as policy but as a theological problem demanding a theodical account.
 - Strong stress on restraints: sin explains war's existence, but Christian theology supplies limits and corrective norms.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Balances Augustine/just-war tradition and Reformed magistrate theology against both pacifist absolutism and uncritical nationalism; resists state absolutism by insisting on divine law as normative.
 - More systematic and theodically self-aware than many pragmatic or purely political treatments in his era.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasizes the language of "divine permission" and the interplay of active vs. permissive providence in the reality of war.
 - Frames war as a theodical category - a useful coinage for linking the problem of evil with public ethics.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in Reformed ethics as a temperate, learned model for addressing modern military questions.
 - Cited by later Reformed ethicists and pastoral theologians as a corrective to both pacifist and militarist extremes.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact, theologically integrated resource for courses in Christian ethics, political theology, and theodicy.
 - Serves as a model for situating applied ethical problems within systematic theology rather than isolating them as political issues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodicy of war:** framing war as a problem of divine justice and providence rather than only political expediency.
- **Divine permission vs. divine will:** distinguishes what God permits in a fallen order from what God positively wills as good.
- **Common grace:** grounds social order and restraints on sin while explaining the imperfect moral results of political action.
- **Magistrate (civil government):** ordained by God to maintain justice and peace; legitimate actor in just-war criteria.
- **Just war criteria (Reformed inflection):** legitimate authority, just cause, right intention, last resort, proportionality - qualified by covenantal obligations and Scripture.
- **Pacifism (critique):** assessed sympathetically for moral aims but rejected when it ignores governmental responsibility and the reality of sin.
- **Militarism (critique):** rejected as idolatrous elevation of force and nation above divine law.
- **Providence (active/permissive):** theological lens for understanding how God governs history that includes war.
- **Covenantal public order:** the notion that political authorities act within God's covenantal governance of society.
- **Christ as Prince of Peace:** Christological norm that limits and orients rightful uses of force toward restoration and peace.
- **Scriptural normativity:** Scripture provides the final criteria for judging wars; natural law and reason interpret these norms for public life.
- **Human sin/the Fall:** primary explanatory factor for the existence and brutality of war.
- **Justice (Divine and human):** measure by which wars are evaluated; divine justice both permits discipline and calls for merciful restraint.
- **Moral restraint / proportionality:** ethical constraints on conduct in war; emphasised more than celebration of victory.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for Reformed articulations of just war and political responsibility.
 - As a polemical and corrective text against both pacifist absolutism and uncritical militarism, and as an exegetical-practical model for Romans 13, covenantal public theology, and theodicy debates.
