### TITLE
Did My Neurons Make Me Do It? Philosophical and Neurobiological Perspectives on Moral Responsibility and Free Will (2007) 
Authors: Nancey Murphy and Warren S. Brown 
Short description: Interdisciplinary defense of moral responsibility and a nonreductive, psychosomatically unified account of persons in light of contemporary neuroscience; critique of simplistic neural determinism.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century debates (mid-2000s) over the implications of neuroscience for free will and moral responsibility.
 - Interdisciplinary milieu: philosophy of mind, experimental neuroscience (Libet-style studies), and theological anthropology; part of broader move toward empirically informed theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Neuroscientific findings do not logically entail the denial of moral responsibility; humans are best understood as **psychosomatic unities** under a nonreductive physicalist framework that preserves normative agency.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Stage-setting: presentation of salient neuroscientific data often cited in determinism claims (readings of Libet, Wegner, etc.).
 - Conceptual analysis: critique of reductionist inferences from neural causation to metaphysical determinism; clarification of levels of explanation.
 - Positive proposal: defense of **nonreductive physicalism / emergentism** and a compatibilist-friendly account of agency where mental states are causally efficacious without ontological dualism.
 - Implications: moral responsibility survives neuroscience when properly interpreted; ethical and theological reasoning must integrate empirical findings without capitulating to eliminativism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Neuroscience: Benjamin Libet, Daniel Wegner, Michael Gazzaniga (as representative experimental backgrounds).
 - Philosophy: Dennett, Churchland, Mele, Fischer, and influential free-will literature (compatibilism vs. incompatibilism).
 - Theology/anthropology: engagement with theological concerns about personhood, sin, and responsibility more than with systematic dogmatics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Human nature / anthropological doctrine** (primary): critique of Cartesian dualism; advocacy of psychosomatic unity.
 - Moral responsibility and free will (philosophical ethics).
 - Indirect theological implications for sin, accountability, and pastoral practice.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Human beings are embodied, causally efficacious agents whose moral responsibility remains intelligible when neuroscience is read through a nonreductive, psychosomatically unified framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **psychosomatic unity**: persons are not souls controlling bodies but integrated embodied agents; this is used both philosophically and theologically.
 - Interdisciplinary method: sustained dialogue between empirical neuroscience (Brown) and philosophical-theological analysis (Murphy).
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters reductive neuroscientific claims that neural antecedents straightforwardly abolish responsibility (the "neurons made me do it" thesis).
 - Distinguishes from eliminative materialism (Churchland-style) by preserving folk-psychological categories as explanatorily indispensable.
 - Offers a mediating position between Cartesian dualists and hard determinists/incompatibilists.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Emphasis on *levels of explanation* and *multiple realization*: neural events do not exhaust explanations for action; mental-level descriptions retain causal relevance.
 - Application of emergentist language to moral agency in a way accessible to theologians and neuroscientists.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorable reception among theologians and philosophers seeking a middle way between dualism and eliminativism; used in neuroethics and pastoral theology debates.
 - Less traction among strict eliminativists and libertarian free-will proponents who demand indeterministic grounding for responsibility.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for courses and research on theological anthropology, neuroethics, and the philosophy of action; exemplary model of interdisciplinary humility and constraint.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psychosomatic unity**
 - Humans conceived as unified embodied persons; rejects substance dualism and soul-body separation.
- **Nonreductive physicalism**
 - Physicalist metaphysics that resists reducing mental properties to neural descriptions; allows for emergent properties.
- **Emergentism**
 - Mental capacities emerge from but are not reducible to neural processes; emergence preserves mental causation.
- **Neural determinism / "neurons made me do it"**
 - Target thesis: simplistic inference from neural causation to loss of moral responsibility; Murphy/Brown critique and demystify.
- **Levels of explanation**
 - Distinction between neural-level and personal-level explanations; both can be causally relevant without conflict.
- **Compatibilism**
 - Position compatible with book: moral responsibility can be preserved even if some physical determinism holds, given appropriate constraints on control and reasons-responsiveness.
- **Libet-type experiments**
 - Empirical work often cited against free will; authors argue these do not decisively undercut agency because of interpretation and scope limits.
- **Folk psychology**
 - Everyday mentalistic vocabulary (beliefs, desires, intentions) defended as indispensable and scientifically respectable.
- **Moral responsibility**
 - Retained as a meaningful, prescriptive notion grounded in persons' capacities for reasons-responsive action.
- **Causal efficacy of mental states**
 - Claim that mental states are causally effective, not epiphenomenal; central to preserving responsibility.
- **Multiple realization**
 - Same mental state can be realized by different neural substrates; used to argue against reductive identity claims.
- **Interdisciplinary constraint**
 - Methodological commitment to letting empirical data inform philosophical claims while maintaining analytic rigor.
- **Neuroethics**
 - Practical field where the book is often cited for ethical policy and pastoral implications.
- **Anthropological pivot**
 - Work functions as a pivot point in theological anthropology between dualist tradition and materialist critiques.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for psychosomatic unity and nonreductive physicalist theological anthropology.
- As a **polemic** against neural determinism and eliminative readings of neuroscience.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on neuroethics, free will, and pastoral theology to integrate empirical findings with normative claims.
