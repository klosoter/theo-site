### TITLE
**The Structure of Biblical Covenants - Peter J. Gentry (essay)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/Reformed scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century). Situated within the redemptive-historical and covenantal revival in evangelical seminaries; dialogues with canonical critics and covenant theologians.
- **Central thesis:** The biblical covenants share a coherent, recurrent structural pattern (promise, stipulation/mediator, ratification/sign, historical fulfillment) that functions typologically across redemptive history and finds its climactic fulfillment in Christ and the covenant community.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of major covenants (Noah, Abraham, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) to isolate recurring structural elements.
 - Identification of a tripartite/quadruple pattern: divine promise + historical commission/stipulation + ratification/kingly oath + sign/ceremony.
 - Typological argument: earlier covenants serve as types/foreshadows whose intent and form point forward to fuller realization in later covenants, culminating in Christ as mediator.
 - Hermeneutical implication: reading Scripture as a unified covenantal narrative preserves both continuity and legitimate discontinuity; prevents collapse into either flattening continuity or divorcing covenants into unrelated dispensations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Draws on the Reformed covenant tradition and modern redemptive-historical interpreters.
 - Interacts with covenant-structure scholarship (e.g., suzerainty-treaty models), canonical critics, and typology proponents (implicitly dialoguing with scholars like Meredith Kline, Brevard Childs, and contemporary Reformed theologians).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (structure and substance), typology and fulfillment, Christology (mediatorial role), ecclesiology (covenant people), eschatology (consummation of covenant promises), sacramental sign-use.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Biblical covenants are not a loose bundle of divine acts but a coherent, structurally patterned history of promise and fulfillment centered in Christ the mediator, which governs faithful biblical interpretation and ecclesial identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases/formulations:**
 - Focus on **structure** as hermeneutical key: recurring formal elements provide a stable grid for reading promise and fulfillment.
 - Strong insistence that typology is structural rather than merely moral or analogical - covenants function as divinely instituted types with forward-pointing intent.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against both loose typologizing that reads arbitrary correspondences and rigid dispensational fragmentation that severs covenantal continuity.
 - Refines earlier suzerainty-treaty readings by combining form-critical patterns with canonical, Christocentric fulfillment logic.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulates a compact formula for covenant elements (promise + mediator/stipulation + ratification + sign) as a tool for both exegesis and systematic correlation.
 - Emphasizes the distinction between **administrations** of the covenant and the covenant **substance** across redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a concise model for covenantal biblical theology.
 - Influential in pastoral and homiletical settings that require a principled way to argue continuity/fulfillment.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable interpretive framework that balances diachronic development and theological unity without collapsing diversity.
 - Useful as a teaching heuristic for linking OT covenant forms to NT fulfillment in Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant structure:** Recurring formal elements in biblical covenants (promise, stipulation, ratification, sign).
- **Promise (covenantal promise):** Divine pledge that initiates covenant relationship; often future-oriented and messianic in scope.
- **Stipulation / Commission:** Duties or royal instructions tied to the covenant; frequently mediated by a covenant head (e.g., patriarch, king, Moses).
- **Ratification / Oath:** Divine act or ceremony that seals the covenant (sacrificial acts, covenant meals, oaths).
- **Sign / Rite:** Physical marker or sacrament that witnesses the covenant (rainbow, circumcision, Passover, Lord's Supper).
- **Mediator / Mediatorial figure:** The covenant representative (e.g., Adam/figure, Moses, Davidic king, Christ) who enacts and secures covenant obligations.
- **Typology (structural typology):** Reading earlier covenants/figures as divinely intended types whose pattern and promise are fulfilled in later covenants, especially Christ.
 - Contrast: differs from mere allegory or ahistorical moralizing; rooted in covenantal structure and divine intent.
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern:** Dynamic axis by which covenantal promises are progressively realized across redemptive history.
- **Administration vs. Substance:** Distinction between changing covenantal administrations (external forms) and the unchanging substance of the covenant of grace.
- **Suzerainty-treaty model:** Form-critical backdrop for covenant elements, integrated with canonical fulfillment emphases.
- **Covenant of grace (center concept):** The single covenantal economy expressed through successive covenants, unified in its goal - salvation in Christ.
- **Kingdom language:** Covenantal patterns are king-oriented (promises, oaths, vassal obligations) and point to God's sovereign rule realized in Christ.
- **Eschatological fulfillment:** Final consummation of covenant promises in Christ's return and the new creation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for structural/readable models of biblical covenants in biblical-theology courses.
- As a **polemic tool** against dispensational fragmentation and against non-historical typology.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and sermon series that trace covenantal promise-fulfillment to Christ.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology to relate covenant doctrine, Christology, and ecclesiology.
