### TITLE
**Perspectives Old and New on Paul: The "Lutheran" Paul and His Critics** - Stephen Westerholm

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in the late 20th / early 21st-century controversy over the New Perspective on Paul (NPP). Responds to E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright and related scholarship that reinterprets Paul within covenantal nomism and first‑century Judaism.
 - Written from a historically engaged, theologically conservative-evangelical vantage that defends classical Reformation readings of justification.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The "Lutheran" reading of Paul - that Paul teaches forensic justification by faith with imputed righteousness - is a legitimate, theologically coherent and textually grounded interpretation. NPP critiques understate or misconstrue the forensic/declarative dimensions central to Paul and Luther.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs the Lutheran/Reformation reading of Paul on justification and shows its biblical warrant.
 - Critically examines NPP claims about "works of the law," covenantal nomism, and the alleged misreading of Paul by Luther.
 - Defends the plausibility and theological necessity of forensic categories (imputation, acquittal, justification-as-declaration).
 - Shows how exegetical revisions that reduce justification to covenant membership or ethical transformation fail to capture Pauline rhetoric and soteriological logic.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright (NPP proponents).
 - Historical touchpoints: Martin Luther and Reformation commentators; Pauline corpus (especially Romans, Galatians, 2 Corinthians).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic/declarative), imputation (double imputation), righteousness, law and works, covenant, grace, faith, sanctification, Pauline Christology and atonement as implicated in declarative righteousness.

- **Closing line**
 - Westerholm argues that to do justice to Paul is to acknowledge the centrality of forensic justification and imputation; corrective hermeneutics that erase this core weaken both biblical exegesis and doctrinal clarity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong reclamation of the forensic/declarative language in Paul as doctrinally essential rather than merely ancillary or rhetorical.
 - Attention to the theological coherence of justification-with-imputation as integrated with Pauline Christology.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges NPP's narrowing of "works of the law" to ethnic boundary markers, insisting Paul's critique encompasses human claim to righteousness and meritorious works.
 - Corrects readings that portray Luther as anachronistically anti‑Jewish or fundamentally mistaken about Paul's main concerns.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reinstates and clarifies Reformation technical terms (forensic, imputation, declaration) within contemporary historical criticism without naively conflating later scholastic categories and Pauline thought.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among critics of the New Perspective; influential in conservative/Reformed circles for reaffirming traditional soteriology.
 - Stimulated more nuanced debates about the interplay of forensic and covenantal language in Pauline theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a methodological corrective: insists exegetical proposals respect both historical context and theological grammar. Useful in teaching to balance historical-critical insights with doctrinal fidelity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification (forensic/declarative)** - God's legal declaration of righteousness, not merely inward moral transformation.
- **Imputation** - God's accounting: believers' sin credited to Christ and Christ's righteousness credited to believers (double imputation).
- **Works / works of the law** - Human deeds or claims that seek to establish righteousness; NPP narrows this to boundary markers, Westerholm resists that reduction.
 - Contrast: *Works-as-merit* (classical reading) vs *works-as-boundary-signs* (NPP).
- **Covenantal nomism** - Sanders' description of first-century Jewish practice; Westerholm engages this as background but resists its displacement of forensic concerns.
- **Grace** - Unmerited favor enabling acquittal; central in Pauline soteriology as understood by Lutherans and Westerholm.
- **Faith** - Trust/witness that receives the declared righteousness; ecclesially located but also forensic in effect.
- **Righteousness (dikaiosyne)** - Both status declared and the quality of God's act; Westerholm emphasizes status as primary in justification language.
- **Declaration / verdict language** - Courtroom metaphors in Paul that indicate legal acquittal rather than purely transformative sanctification.
- **Union with Christ** - The ontological ground that makes imputation meaningful; Christ's obedience and death are the basis for the declarative verdict.
- **Sanctification** - Related but distinct from justification; moral transformation follows or flows from declared status, not identical to it.
- **Pauline rhetoric** - Westerholm stresses Paul's argumentative context and rhetorical aims in indicting human righteousness claims.
- **Lutheran Paul** - The interpretive lens that reads Paul's soteriology chiefly in forensic terms; central to Westerholm's rescue project.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the classical forensic-imputation model of justification in Pauline theology.
 - As a **polemic** against New Perspective hermeneutics and as a corrective to readings that minimize forensic language.
 - As an **exegetical model** that integrates rhetorical-historical reading with doctrinal categories, useful for teaching justification and Pauline soteriology.
