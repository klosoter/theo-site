### TITLE
Paul Helm on Molinism (various journal articles and blog posts)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-early 21st century Reformed philosophical theology. Helm writes as an analytic-minded Reformed theologian/philosopher responding to the resurgence of Molinism (Luis de Molina rediscovery, William Lane Craig, Alvin Plantinga debates) within evangelical and analytic circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Molinism (middle knowledge) attempts to reconcile libertarian free will with divine foreknowledge and providential planning by positing true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom known by God prior to divine decree. Helm contends this move is theologically and metaphysically defective and undercuts classical Reformed teaching on divine sovereignty, decree, and providence.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Clarify Molinist taxonomy: natural knowledge, middle knowledge (counterfactuals of freedom), and free knowledge (God's actual-world knowledge after decree).
 - Raise the **grounding problem**: counterfactuals about what free creatures would do in hypothetical circumstances lack truth-makers independent of those creatures' actual decisions; thus cannot be known prior to those decisions.
 - Argue Molinism makes God's knowledge derivative of creaturely dispositions or choices, thereby diminishing divine sovereignty and the priority of the divine will.
 - Defend a classical Reformed alternative: God knows possibilities in relation to his own decrees and providential causation; divine foreknowledge is not primarily grounded in creaturely counterfactuals but in God's eternal decree and causally efficacious providence.
 - Scriptural and pastoral considerations: assert that biblical texts on election, providence, and decree cohere better with a compatibilist/Reformed account than with Molinism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Luis de Molina (historical source of middle knowledge), William Lane Craig (contemporary Molinist defender), Alvin Plantinga (on freedom and possible worlds), and various analytic philosophers addressing the grounding objection; Helm also interacts with classical Reformation and medieval sources by contrast.
- **Doctrines treated:** providence, divine sovereignty, foreknowledge, predestination, human freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist), truth and metaphysics of counterfactuals, theodicy implicit in divine governance.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Helm locates the theological center on **the priority of the divine decree and sovereign providence** - Molinism sacrifices that priority for a dubious metaphysical account of middle knowledge that undermines classical Reformed commitments.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insistence that any credible theory of divine knowledge must preserve God as first cause and sovereign governor, not as epistemically dependent on creaturely counterfactuals.
 - Use of the grounding objection as decisive: truth about counterfactuals requires grounding in actual states of affairs.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contrasts with Molina/Craig by rejecting the intelligibility and theological innocuousness of middle knowledge.
 - Contrasts with libertarian defenders who prioritize creaturely autonomy; Helm prioritizes God's covenantal and sovereign causality.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Sharp reiteration of "priority of the decree" language applied against the threefold Molinist knowledge schema.
 - Focus on the epistemic dependence problem rather than merely exegetical quarrels.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely cited by conservative Reformed theologians and philosophers who resist Molinism; serves as a go-to analytic critique within Reformed journals and blogs.
 - Stimulated more precise treatments of grounding, truthmakers, and divine timelessness among both proponents and opponents of Molinism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, disciplined articulation of Reformed commitments in contemporary analytic language.
 - Serves as a methodological model: marry careful metaphysical critique with theological hermeneutics when assessing competing models of providence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Molinism:** The theological system (after Molina) positing God's middle knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom.
- **Middle knowledge (scientia media):** God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in hypothetical situations, prior to divine decree.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs):** Propositions of the form "If person P were in circumstance C, P would freely do action A."
- **Grounding objection:** The claim that CCFs lack truth-makers prior to actual free choices and so cannot be genuinely known by God.
- **Divine decree (priority of the decree):** Helm's emphasis that God's eternal will and decree are ontologically and epistemically prior to creaturely possibilities.
- **Foreknowledge vs. middle knowledge:** Contrasts classical simple foreknowledge grounded in decree with the Molinist threefold knowledge scheme.
- **Compatibilism (Reformed sense):** The view Helm favors: human responsibility is compatible with divine causation and providential determination.
- **Libertarian freedom:** The kind of indeterministic freedom Molinists defend; Helm critiques its theological consequences.
- **Truth-maker:** The metaphysical grounding that makes propositions (especially CCFs) true; central to Helm's objection.
- **Providence:** God's governance where events are ordered under the divine decree - Helm argues Molinism disperses or relativizes this governance.
- **Transworld freedom / transworld depravity:** Related Plantingan concepts invoked in transworld discussions; Helm treats them sceptically when used to shore up Molinism.
- **Scriptural exegesis on election:** Helm uses exegetical arguments from Romans, Ephesians, etc., to buttress the decree-centered model.
- **Divine timelessness / eternity:** Background metaphysical issue: how God's atemporal knowledge relates to possible worlds - Helm prefers models that keep divine sovereignty intact.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and concise critique of Molinism for Reformed teaching syllabi.
- As a **polemic** resource in debates over providence, used to press the grounding objection and defend Reformed compatibilism.
- As an **exegetical model** when aligning biblical predestination texts with a sovereign-decree framework rather than Molinist readings.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for further analytic work on truth-makers, counterfactuals, and the metaphysics of divine knowledge.
