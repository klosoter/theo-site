### TITLE
Religion, Revolution, and the Future (1969) - Jürgen Moltmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1960s: postwar West Germany, student movements (1968), Cold War tensions, rise of New Left and liberation theology.
 - Builds on Moltmann's earlier The Theology of Hope (1964); writes as systematic and political theologian seeking a praxis-oriented eschatology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian eschatology (theology of the future) must serve as a prophetic critique of existing religion and social orders and become the motivating force for revolutionary transformation of culture and politics.
 - Religion that evacuates eschatological hope becomes ideology; authentic faith calls for social change oriented to the Kingdom of God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary religion functions conservatively, sustaining unjust social structures by promising private salvation and spiritual consolation.
 - Theological correction: Recover the eschatological dimension of Christian faith - hope that anticipates God's future and judges the present.
 - Political implication: Eschatological hope grounds solidarity with oppressed movements and legitimates revolutionary praxis insofar as it seeks structures consonant with God's promised future.
 - Prescriptive moves: Theology must ally with democratic and socialist movements where they pursue human emancipation, while preserving Christian distinctives.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages critically with Marxist social analysis (uses Marxist categories as descriptive tools), dialogue with Ernst Bloch on hope, implicit and explicit contrasts with Karl Barth and liberal Protestant accommodation.
 - Uses biblical eschatology, patristic and Reformation motifs to reframe contemporary political theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (primary): hope, future, kingdom of God as theological categories that orient praxis.
 - **Christology**: Christ as center of the future‑directed salvific event; grounding for solidarity.
 - **Ecclesiology & Ethics**: Church's role as prophetic community, ethics of social engagement.
 - **Revelation**: revelation as future‑oriented promise, not merely past event.
 - Secondary touchpoints: social doctrine, theology of political structures, critique of ideology.
- **Closing line**
 - Theology that truly knows God's future cannot be passive: eschatological hope must dismantle religion's collusion with injustice and energize revolutionary transformation toward the Kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **future-oriented eschatology** as the motor of theology and politics rather than abstract doctrine or pietism.
 - Treats **political revolution** as a theological category when it aims to realize human emancipation consonant with divine promise.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal theology's accommodation to modernity and pietistic religion's inwardness; challenges Barthian reserve about social engagement by pressing theology into public praxis.
 - Unlike proponents who see Marxism solely as enemy, Moltmann appropriates Marxist social critique as an analytical tool while resisting reductionism.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames religion vs. faith through an **eschatological test**: if religion obscures the future it is ideology.
 - Advances the idea of **eschatological praxis** - political action validated by orientation to God's future.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential for liberation theology, political theology, and socially engaged Protestantism; spurred debates over the Christian relationship to socialism.
 - Criticized by conservatives for perceived political compromise and by Marxists for retaining theological categories.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for integrating eschatology with public ethics and political critique; valuable in courses on political theology, Christian social ethics, and contemporary Reformed thought.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological hope** - central theological category; future‑directed expectation that judges and transforms the present.
- **Religion (as ideology)** - institutional or devotional forms that domesticate hope and legitimize status quo.
- **Revolution** - social and political transformation; for Moltmann, theologically justified when oriented to human emancipation and the Kingdom.
- **Kingdom of God** - normative horizon that defines what counts as just social change.
- **Eschatological praxis** - praxis validated by its orientation to God's promised future; integrates politics and theology.
- **Political theology** - the project of theologizing about political structures and movements from an eschatological standpoint.
- **Solidarity with the oppressed** - ethical demand deriving from Christological witnessing to the future.
- **Critique of capitalist structures** - not purely economic analysis but theological condemnation when structures negate human dignity.
- **Dialogue with Marxism** - selective appropriation of Marxist critique as analytical tool without theological reductionism.
- **Prophetic church** - ecclesial self‑understanding as agent of future‑oriented justice rather than passive worship community.
- **Future as revelatory category** - revelation understood primarily in terms of promise and coming rather than mere past occurrence.
- **Praxis over orthodoxy (secondary claim)** - orthodoxy matters but must be expressed in transformative action.
- **Human emancipation** - theological telos aligned with social liberation rather than individualistic salvation.
