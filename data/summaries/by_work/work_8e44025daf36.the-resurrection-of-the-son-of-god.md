### TITLE
**N. T. Wright, The Resurrection of the Son of God (2003)** 
Volume 3 in Christian Origins and the Question of God. A comprehensive historical-theological study of resurrection in antiquity and the early church, arguing for Jesus's bodily resurrection as the catalyst of Christian origins and the launch of new creation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 2000s, within the "Third Quest" for the historical Jesus; reaction against skeptical and de-mythologizing trajectories (Bultmann, Crossan, Borg).
 - Methodologically self-conscious "critical realism," combining historical rigor with worldview analysis.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The early Christian belief that God raised Jesus bodily from the dead is best explained by an empty tomb and real appearances, within a Jewish resurrection framework. This event inaugurates God's new creation and reconfigures eschatology, Christology, anthropology, and mission.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of **pagan views of death/afterlife**: no resurrection; immortality of the soul in various forms; body viewed negatively in many strands.
 - **Second Temple Judaism**: diverse but converging hope of bodily resurrection at the end (e.g., 2 Macc 7; Dan 12; Pharisaic streams), maintaining creational goodness.
 - **Earliest Christian belief**: sudden, mutation-within-continuity shift-resurrection of one man in the middle of history; titles and worship reoriented around the risen Jesus.
 - **Historical case**: the conjunction of an empty tomb and multiple, transformed appearances uniquely accounts for the rise and shape of Easter faith and ecclesial practice.
 - **Theological implications**: new creation (Rom 8; 1 Cor 15), vindication and Sonship (Rom 1:4), Spirit as arrabon of resurrection life, ecclesial mission as resurrection-shaped praxis.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Ancient: Homer, Plato, Plutarch; Jewish texts (Qumran, Wisdom, 2 Maccabees, Josephus, Philo), LXX, Dan 12.
 - NT: Paul (1 Cor 15; Rom 8), Synoptics, John, Acts; patristic echoes.
 - Modern: Bultmann, Crossan, Borg, Vermes; engagement with Sanders, Dunn, Pannenberg, Meier.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology**: inaugurated/consummated framework; final judgment, new heavens and new earth.
 - **Christology**: resurrection as divine vindication and declaration of Sonship and lordship.
 - **Anthropology/Creation**: goodness of creation, body-soul holism; human vocation renewed.
 - **Soteriology**: resurrection as objective victory and as the hinge of justification/new life.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as firstfruits and down payment of resurrection life.
- **Center of gravity**
 - The resurrection is God's decisive, world-creating act in history, launching the new creation and summoning a resurrection-shaped people and hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust defense of **bodily** (not merely spiritual) resurrection; reclaims Jewish creational eschatology.
 - Coinage/usage of **life after life after death** to clarify intermediate state vs final resurrection.
 - Integration of historical method with theological claim via **critical realism**.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Platonizing eschatology**: rejects the soul's escape as Christian hope.
 - Against **purely metaphorical resurrection**: insists on historical bedrock (empty tomb + appearances).
 - Nuances **Adam-Christ**: stresses corporate representation and vocation over abstract metaphysics of the soul.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - **Two-pronged historical inference**: empty tomb plus appearances produce early Christian mutations.
 - **Inaugurated eschatology** reframed around new creation, not mere timeless immortality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used across evangelical, catholic, and mainline scholarship for resurrection studies and apologetics.
 - In Reformed circles: welcomed for creational eschatology and 1 Cor 15 exegesis; debated where readings touch New Perspective themes and Adamic headship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Canonical synthesis with historical rigor; provides a standard account for teaching resurrection, final judgment, and the new creation's ethical-cultural implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (anastasis)**: bodily re-embodiment after death; distinct from resuscitation or immortality of the soul.
- **Empty tomb and appearances**: twin historical anchors explaining Easter faith's origin and character.
- **Critical realism**: epistemic stance combining realism about events with awareness of interpretive frameworks.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**: the end has begun in Christ's resurrection; consummation awaits his return.
- **New creation**: cosmic renewal begun in Christ and the Spirit; grounds Christian hope and mission.
- **Firstfruits (aparche)**: Christ's resurrection as the initial installment guaranteeing believers' resurrection (1 Cor 15).
- **Spiritual body (soma pneumatikon)**: Spirit-animated, transformed bodily life; not non-bodily.
- **Intermediate state**: conscious but incomplete pre-resurrection life with Christ; distinct from final resurrection ("life after life after death").
- **Vindication/Sonship**: resurrection as God's public declaration of Jesus as Son and Lord (Rom 1:4; Ps 2 echo).
- **Adam-Christ typology**: death through Adam, life through Christ; corporate solidarity foregrounded (1 Cor 15; Rom 5).
 - Often read against strict **federal headship** claims; Wright emphasizes vocation and representation in history.
- **Final judgment and eternal states**: judgment within a renewed-creation telos; heaven-and-earth united.
- **Pneumatological arrabon**: the Spirit as pledge and power of resurrection life (Rom 8).
- **Historia salutis vs ordo salutis**: resurrection as redemptive-historical hinge that shapes personal salvation (union, justification, sanctification).
- **Christ and culture**: resurrection authorizes embodied, public discipleship within creation's renewal.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Definition source** for resurrection/new creation against disembodied eschatologies.
 - **Exegetical model** for 1 Cor 15, Rom 8, gospel passion-resurrection narratives.
 - **Polemic/apologetic** resource on historicity (empty tomb + appearances).
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking eschatology to anthropology, mission, and cultural engagement.
