### TITLE
The Person of Christ - D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical scholarship: a conservative-evangelical attempt to retrieve rigorous New Testament exegesis for constructive Christology.
 - Situated against both liberal historical-critical reductionism and speculative neo‑orthodox or pietistic minimizations of doctrine.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament witness requires a Christology that is simultaneously **biblically grounded**, **historically orthodox** (Chalcedonian), and critically attentive to first‑century Jewish and Greco‑Roman contexts; reduction to merely divine or merely human categories distorts biblical data.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey and exegesis of key NT texts establishing Jesus' **preexistence**, **divinity**, and **full humanity**.
 - Defense of the **hypostatic union**: one person, two natures, avoiding Nestorian and Eutychian extremes.
 - Careful treatment of soteriology: how incarnation, substitutionary atonement, resurrection, and exaltation cohere.
 - Practical and ecclesial implications: Christ as mediator, model, and center of worship and mission.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Patristic formulations (Athanasius, the Cappadocians), Chalcedon and later medieval/Reformation articulations (e.g., Calvin).
 - Contemporary interlocutors in New Testament studies and theology: critical scholars who minimize New Testament high christology, and modern theologians advocating various models (e.g., kenotic readings, Christus Victor emphases, narrative‑critical approaches).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (implications for Son and Spirit), Incarnation, Hypostatic Union, Atonement (substitutional, forensic, Christus Victor dimensions), Resurrection, Ascension, Exaltation, Mediation, Sonship (eternal generation and filiation), Christ's offices (Prophet, Priest, King).
- **Closing line**
 - A robust, exegetically disciplined Christology that defends classical orthodoxy while insisting that theological proposals remain accountable to the New Testament witness and its historical context.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence on marrying close NT exegesis with classical doctrinal categories rather than importing later philosophical categories uncritically.
 - Balanced attention to both divine prerogatives and genuine human limitations in Jesus (e.g., consciousness, growth, dependence on the Father) without collapsing into kenotic subordinationism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal reductions that evacuate divine agency from Jesus and conservative pietistic readings that sentimentalize his humanity.
 - Critiques extreme kenotic readings that risk denying Christ's ontological divinity; equally critical of abstract metaphysical definitions divorced from Scripture.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much neologisms as methodological calibration: using NT linguistic and cultural analysis to inform how terms like "Son of God," "Lord," and "Son of Man" are theologically deployed.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in evangelical and Reformed circles for bringing scholarly rigor to pastoral doctrine; used in seminary courses as a model of exegetical restraint combined with doctrinal fidelity.
 - Influential among those seeking a middle path between confessional restoration and contemporary biblical scholarship.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies disciplined integration of exegesis and dogmatics; durable resource for teaching Christology that is both intellectually responsible and confessional.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation** - God become flesh: affirmation of full divinity and full humanity grounded in NT testimony.
- **Hypostatic union** - One person (prosopon/hypostasis) with two natures; avoids Nestorian and Eutychian errors.
- **Preexistence** - The Son's existence prior to Bethlehem as attested in Johannine, Pauline, and other NT texts.
- **Kenosis** - Self‑emptying language (Phil 2): treated cautiously; emphasizes functional self‑limitation, not loss of divinity.
- **Atonement** - Multi‑dimensional: substitutionary/penal language affirmed while acknowledging Christus Victor and participatory motifs.
- **Chalcedonian formula** - Used as corrective framework: two natures "without confusion, change, division, or separation."
- **Two wills / dyothelitism** - Affirmation that Christ possesses human and divine will(s) consonant with orthodox tradition.
- **Son of Man / Son of God** - Distinct but overlapping christological predicates; treated via historical‑contextual exegesis.
- **Mediator** - Christ as unique bridge between God and humanity; grounds soteriology and worship.
- **Resurrection & Exaltation** - Central to the vindication and lordship of Christ; key to NT christological development.
- **Revelation** - Christ as the definitive self‑disclosure of God; shapes doctrine of Scripture and theological method.
- **Substitution (penal)** - Defended as a core motif, though Carson reads it alongside other biblical images.
- **Christus Victor** - Recognized as complementary to substitutionary themes, especially in liberative language.
- **New Testament exegesis** - Methodological priority: doctrine should be built on careful reading of NT texts.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical/Chalcedonian Christology in systematic theology classes.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist liberal and extreme kenotic readings.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking NT study to doctrinal formulation and pastoral application.
