### TITLE
The Already/Not Yet in Eschatology - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid‑ to late‑20th century Reformed academic context; reaction to polarized trends in New Testament scholarship and popular eschatology (realized eschatology vs futurist/dispensational readings). Written for an audience steeped in biblical-theological and covenantal thinking.
- **Central thesis:** Eschatological realities are both legitimately present in Christ's redemptive work and genuinely future in consummation; correct theology must hold both poles without collapsing one into the other.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarifies the logical tension behind "already/not yet" language in New Testament texts (e.g., kingdom sayings, Pauline soteriology).
 - Analyzes how redemptive events at Christ's first coming instantiate eschatological realities while preserving ontological incompleteness pending the final parousia.
 - Defends an *inaugurated eschatology* that preserves biblical continuity (promise-fulfillment, covenantal progression) and discontinuity (eschatological consummation, new creation).
 - Applies tensions to doctrines: how Christ's present reign, the Spirit's work, and sacramental signs function as mediations of eschatological reality.
 - Warns against two distortions:
 - **Over-realization**: treating present spiritual blessings as identical with consummated new creation (a tendency in extreme realized eschatology).
 - **Over-futurization**: deferring nearly all eschatological reality to a singular future event (characteristic of some futurist and dispensational frameworks).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** interacts with strands of New Testament scholarship on realized eschatology, Reformed covenant theologians (the tradition of Vos and covenantal biblical theology), and critics from futurist positions; exegetical attention to Pauline and synoptic passages.
- **Doctrines treated:** eschatology, Christology (mediatorial kingship and exaltation), pneumatology (Spirit as earnest/pledge), covenant theology (promise/fulfillment dynamics), sacramentology (signs and seals as participation in present eschatological reality), soteriology (already blessings vs final glorification).
- **Closing line:** Poythress centers theology on a robust inaugurated eschatology: Christ has brought the eschaton into history in real, mediating ways, yet the full reality awaits consummation - a theological posture that preserves promise, fulfillment, and hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasizes mediational structures (Christ, Spirit, sacraments, covenant institutions) as vehicles of present eschatological reality without collapsing the future consummation.
 - Methodologically blends biblical-theological exegesis with conceptual clarity drawn from analytic categories (tension, overlap, mediation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects C. H. Dodd-style extreme realized eschatology by insisting on genuine future consummation.
 - Counters dispensational/futurist tendencies by insisting that key eschatological blessings are already experienced in Christ and his gifts.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies "already/not yet" as a theological-ontological category rather than merely a temporal or pragmatic formula - stressing degrees of present participation versus future fulfillment.
 - Stresses the idea of "mediated presence" (eschatological reality present through covenantal means).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed academic and seminary contexts as a clear articulation of inaugurated eschatology.
 - Influential in shaping careful pastoral application: hope without triumphalism and realism without pessimism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a durable exegetical framework for interpreting kingdom sayings and Pauline eschatology.
 - Serves as a corrective to theological extremes and a resource for consistent sacramental and covenantal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Already/Not Yet:** central polar pair; present participation in eschatological blessings vs awaiting consummation.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology:** the doctrine that the kingdom has been inaugurated in Christ but awaits completion.
- **Realized Eschatology:** the view that eschatological promises have been fully realized in the present; Poythress critiques extremes of this stance.
- **Futurist Eschatology / Dispensationalism:** tendency to locate eschatological reality primarily in a future event; Poythress resists deferral of present reality.
- **Overlap of Ages:** notion that the old age and new age coexist between Christ's first and second comings.
- **Mediatorial Kingdom:** Christ's present kingship as the means by which the eschaton is mediated into history.
- **Spirit as Earnest/Pledge:** the Spirit's indwelling is the downpayment signaling future full possession (1 Cor 1:22-23 type language in Pauline theology).
- **Sacraments as Signs & Seals:** visible means by which believers partake in present eschatological realities while pointing to future fulfillment.
- **Promise-Fulfillment Pattern:** covenantal structure emphasizing continuity between divine promises and their progressive fulfillment.
- **Typology / Biblical Theology:** use of typological patterns to show foretaste and anticipation of consummation in redemptive history.
- **Escha­tological Tension / Incompleteness:** theological category describing present partiality of redemption.
- **Mediated Presence vs Immediate Consummation:** distinction between participation in the eschaton through means and the eventual unmediated reality.
- **Pastoral Implication - Hope with Waiting:** theological posture combining assurance of present blessings and patient longing for final glorification.
- Uses across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for inaugurated eschatology in Reformed theology curricula.
 - As a **polemic** to critique both over‑realized and over‑futurized readings of New Testament eschatology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for Pauline and synoptic texts and a **conceptual pivot** in integrating covenant, sacrament, and pneumatology into eschatological doctrine.
