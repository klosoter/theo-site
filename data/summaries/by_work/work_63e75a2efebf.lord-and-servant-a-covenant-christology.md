### TITLE
**Lord and Servant: A Covenant Christology** - Michael S. Horton

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th/early-21st-century Reformed renewal and evangelical scholastic retrieval. Horton's work addresses post-Enlightenment theological fragmentation, recovering classical Protestant resources (Reformers, Reformed orthodox) against liberal and some neo-orthodox revisions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ must be understood first and primarily as **covenantal Mediator** - both **Lord** (sovereign, federal head, king) and **Servant** (suffering, incarnate Redeemer). This bipolar identity resolves competing reductions (either purely metaphysical divinity or merely moral exemplarism).
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes covenant as the primary framework for reading Scripture and locating Christ's identity and work.
 - Analyzes biblical motifs: royal lordship (kingdom, Davidic/eschatological promises) and servant-suffering (Isaiah, Passion narratives), showing their unity in the one Mediator.
 - Shows how the incarnate Son accommodates revelation to creaturely finitude while maintaining ontological deity (incarnational analogy).
 - Treats soteriology (substitution, penal aspects), union with Christ, and the eschatological consummation (resurrection and new creation).
 - Applies covenantal Christology to ecclesiology and sacraments: Christ's headship governs covenant life and signs.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy appeal to Scripture and Reformational writers (notably Calvin and federalist Reformed tradition); critical engagement with modern thinkers who separate the person and work of Christ (liberal Protestantism, existentialist readings) and with strands of neo-orthodoxy that relativize covenant categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and accommodation; covenant (works/grace, covenant headship); Trinity and the economic relations of the Son; Christology (hypostatic union, offices of Christ); soteriology (substitution, union, justification); eschatology (resurrection and new creation).
- **Targeted topical references:**
 - **Resurrection and New Creation:** Horton insists the resurrection is the covenantal vindication and inauguration of new creation - the historical, bodily resurrection secures the promised new order and is central to covenantal fulfillment.
 - **Accommodation and Incarnational Analogy:** Horton defends strong incarnational accommodation: the Son condescends to creaturely forms of revelation without compromising divine identity; analogies between God and creature are analogical, not equivocal.
- **Closing line:** A systematic recovery of Christ as covenant Mediator: reigning Lord who servanthood accomplishes covenantal redemption and inaugurates new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Makes **covenant** the organizing principle of Christology rather than primarily metaphysical categories or modern existentialist concerns.
 - Reframes the lord/servant antinomy as **complementary offices** of the one Mediator, emphasizing functional (covenantal) unity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies that domesticate Christ to ethical exemplar or purely spiritual presence.
 - Pushes back on readings that privatize revelation or downplay the resurrection's bodily and cosmic significance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Stresses **federal headship** language in close connection with incarnational accommodation - the Son represents humanity while remaining ontologically divine.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles as a compact defense of covenantal Christology; used in pastoral and academic settings to re-center covenant thinking in Christological and soteriological debates.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, teachable synthesis that links biblical exegesis (servant songs, passion, resurrection) with confessional categories; valuable for courses on Christology, soteriology, and Reformed systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant Christology:** Christology grounded in covenantal categories - mediator, head, fulfillment of covenant promises.
- **Lord and Servant:** Two complementary roles of the one Son - sovereign king (Lord) and obedient suffering servant (Isaiah/Passion).
- **Mediator (Mediate/Immediate):** The Son as the unique bridge between God and humanity; functional language stressing representation and substitution.
- **Federal Head / Headship:** Christ as corporate representative of elect humanity in covenantal relation.
- **Incarnational Accommodation:** Divine condescension in revelation - God speaks and acts within creaturely forms while remaining transcendent.
 - Relation to **Incarnational Analogy:** Affirmation of genuine analogy (not pure metaphor) between Creator and creature in revelation.
- **Hypostatic Union:** Maintained as the ontological basis for Christ's dual role - deity and humanity united in one Person.
- **Substitution / Penal Elements:** Emphasizes substitutionary atonement within covenant fulfillment; penal aspects tied to divine justice and legal imputation.
- **Union with Christ:** Central soteriological dynamic - believers' status and life are covenantally in Christ.
- **Resurrection and New Creation:** Resurrection is covenantal vindication and inauguration of the new creation; bodily, historical, eschatological.
- **Revelation:** Scripture as covenantal witness to the Mediator; revelation is both propositional and incarnational.
- **Offices of Christ (Prophet, Priest, King):** Functional descriptors locating Christ's work within covenant economy.
- **Sacraments as Covenant Signs:** Baptism and Lord's Supper portrayed as covenantal seals tied to Christ's mediatorial action.
- **Analogical Language:** Upholds analogical predication about God against equivocal or univocal extremes.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for covenantal/federal Christology in systematic theology syllabi.
 - As a **polemic** tool against liberal and reductionist Christologies that downplay resurrection, substitution, or covenantal representation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating resurrection texts into a covenantal-eschatological framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and sacramental theology connecting Christ's mediatorship to church life.
