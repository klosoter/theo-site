### TITLE
The Self-Disclosure of Jesus - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton/Reformed milieu; Vos as leading figure in the emerging discipline of Biblical Theology.
 - Written as a corrective to liberal theological tendencies that privatized revelation (reducing it to feeling, ethics, or mere moral teaching) and to overly abstract dogmatics detached from redemptive history.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God's revelation is fundamentally the personal, historical self-disclosure of the Son. Revelation is an event in history centered in Jesus, not merely a set of propositions or religious experiences.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern theology separates revelation from concrete historical mediation and from the person of Christ.
 - Positive alternative: Revelation must be conceived as the Son's self-manifesting-an historical, objective act with personal agency and salvific content.
 - Exegetical support: readings of Gospel and Pauline materials showing how Jesus functions as interpretive center of Scripture.
 - Dogmatic consequences: implications for the Trinity (economic vs. immanent), for inspiration and Scripture's unity, and for soteriology (mediation, atonement).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Schleiermacher and Ritschl (liberal reductionism), representatives of higher criticism.
 - Resources drawn: Reformed scholastic and patristic tradition, Calvin's Christocentrism, contemporary Princetonians (Hodge, Warfield) and Vos's own redemptive-historical method.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (personal and historical), Christology (Person and work of the Son), Doctrine of the Trinity (economic revelation), Bibliology (Scripture as witness to Christ), Covenant theology, Anthropology and Sin insofar as they relate to receptivity of revelation.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The essence of divine revelation is the incarnate Son's personal self-disclosure in history: Jesus is the decisive, normative revelation of God whose historical manifestation grounds Scripture, doctrine, and salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Revelation as an *act* of personal self-revelation (not a static deposit or merely propositional content).
 - Christ as the hermeneutical key: all Scripture is to be read and understood in relation to the unique self-disclosure of Jesus.
 - Strong integration of historical exegesis with dogmatic construction (Biblical Theology as bridge).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal reductions (religious feeling, ethics, or myth) and against abstract dogmatic systems that ignore redemptive history.
 - Distances from purely propositional models of revelation without denying propositional truth - insists propositions are grounded in a historical revelatory event.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Prominent use of the term **self-disclosure** (Selbstoffenbarung): emphasizes personal agency and intentionality in divine revelation.
 - Emphasis on **historical concreteness** and **redemptive-historical progression** as methodological norms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed circles as a foundational statement for redemptive-historical exegesis and Christ-centered theology.
 - Adopted and adapted by later biblical-theologians and conservative scholars who sought to integrate rigorous historical study with confessional dogmatics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined middle path: critical historical awareness within a confessional, Christ-centered framework. Valuable for preaching, systematic theology, and hermeneutics that seek unity between Bible and doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-disclosure (Selbstoffenbarung)** - God's personal, intentional revealing; primary category for understanding revelation.
- **Historical revelation** - Revelation occurs in concrete events (chiefly in Christ), not only in abstract truths.
- **Incarnation as revelatory event** - The Son's becoming flesh is the decisive act of God's self-manifestation.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - The rule that Scripture's meaning coheres around the person and work of Christ.
- **Economic Trinity** - The "economic" activity of Father, Son, and Spirit as the mode of self-disclosure; ties doctrine of God to revelation in history.
- **Objective-subjective relation** - Balances objective act of revelation (what God does) with subjective appropriation (faith, reception) without collapsing either.
- **Redemptive-historical method** - Reading Biblical history as a progressive unfolding culminating in Christ; method for linking exegesis and dogmatics.
- **Mediation (Person and Work)** - Christ as both the bearer (Person) and accomplisher (Work) of revelation and salvation.
- **Scripture as witness** - Scripture functions as the authoritative witness to the Sin­-disclosing, grace-giving self-revelation of Jesus.
- **Covenant framing** - Covenantal structures used to explain continuity and development of revelation.
- **Prophetic-kingly-priestly motifs** - Functional Christological lenses used for interpreting the Son's roles in self-disclosure.
- **Anti-reductionism** - Polemical posture against reducing revelation to sentiment, ethics, or mere doctrine.
- **Use across loci**
 - Serves as a definitional source for the doctrine of Revelation and for Christ-centered Bibliology.
 - Employed polemically against liberal theology and reductionist readings of Scripture.
 - Acts as an exegetical model and conceptual pivot in Christology and Biblical Theology courses and in preaching that insists on historical, personal revelation.
