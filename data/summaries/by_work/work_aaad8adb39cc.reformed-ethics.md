### TITLE
Reformed Ethics - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Reformed theology; Bavinck (1854-1921) writing within the neo-Calvinist milieu shaped by polemics against liberal theology, pietistic subjectivism, and naïve modernism. Published as Gereformeerde Ethiek (translated as Reformed Ethics); intended as systematic, dogmatic grounding for practical theology and moral instruction.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Christian ethics must be derived from and integrated with Reformed dogmatics: revelation, covenant, Christology and the doctrine of sin. Moral life is not autonomous rationality but lived obedience arising from union with Christ and covenantal relation to God.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Ethical method begins with Scripture and the normative claims of divine revelation rather than autonomous moral philosophy.
 - Human nature and duty are explained through creation, fall (including the corruption of the will), and redemption - establishing moral anthropology before norms.
 - Law and gospel correlate: the moral law exposes sin and structures social life while the gospel renews the will and enables sanctification.
 - The ethical life is corporate and vocational: family, church, civil order, and professional spheres each embody duties under divine law.
 - Practical ethics concerns both private piety and public justice; duties flow from covenant obligations and the triune God's purposes.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Calvin (primary Reformed anchor); engagement with scholastic Reformed tradition, Abraham Kuyper (contemporary), and critical interaction with Kantian moralism, utilitarianism, pietism, and modern theological liberalism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture as normative, covenant theology, human nature and sin, the will and moral responsibility, sanctification, law (moral, ceremonial, civil), state and church relations, providence and divine government, Christology (ethical implications of union with Christ).
- **Relevant topical emphases:** detailed treatments of human will, guilt and responsibility (see Sin And Free Will); nuanced account of suffering, providence, and God's righteousness (see Theodicy And Divine Justice).
- **Closing line:** Bavinck's Reformed Ethics situates moral life squarely within a doctrinal, covenantal, and Christ-centered framework: ethics is theology in action, where divine sovereignty and human responsibility cohere under Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Ethics as intrinsically theological - cannot be abstracted from dogma; moral norms are fruit of covenantal relationship.
 - Strong integration of personal piety with social-ethical duties; private sanctification and public justice are contiguous.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters liberal autonomy of ethics by restoring Scripture and covenant as normative.
 - Corrects pietistic privatism by insisting on social and institutional moral obligations.
 - Nuances issues of free will-rejects both determinist reductionism and voluntarist Pelagianism (see Sin And Free Will).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic linking of dogmatics and ethics as mutually informing disciplines; moral categories consistently reframed in dogmatic terms (e.g., sanctification as ethical ontology).
 - Careful distinction between types of law (moral, civil, ceremonial) applied within a covenantal moral economy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely adopted in Reformed seminaries as a standard text for practical theology and ethics; influential on mid-20th-century Reformed moral theology.
 - Appreciated by scholars for theological comprehensiveness and pastoral sensitivity; occasionally critiqued for conservative cultural assumptions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model for integrating systematic theology and ethics.
 - Resource for treating doctrinally charged moral issues (e.g., providence, suffering, responsibility) with theological nuance (see Theodicy And Divine Justice).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** Fundamental relational framework for ethical obligations; grounds duties to God, neighbor, and institutions.
- **Law (moral/civil/ceremonial):** Distinct but related spheres; moral law universal, civil law contextual, ceremonial typological - all interpreted covenantally.
- **Scripture / Revelation:** Normative source; ethics proceeds from authoritative revelation, not autonomous reason.
- **Sin (depravity):** Radical corruption of nature affecting will, intellect, and affections; moral inability excludes moral autonomy (see Sin And Free Will).
- **Free will / human responsibility:** Will understood as freedom under constraint of nature and grace; responsible agency affirmed alongside divine sovereignty.
- **Grace and sanctification:** Ethical renewal is effect of justification and union with Christ; moral action is empowered, not merely commanded.
- **Providence / divine government:** God's sovereign ordering of history informs ethical response to suffering and social injustice (see Theodicy And Divine Justice).
- **Theodicy / divine justice:** Bavinck balances God's righteousness with human culpability; suffering assessed in light of redemptive purpose and final eschatological justice.
- **Common grace:** Grounds cultural and civic goods; explains continuity of moral insight in non-Christian spheres.
- **Vocation / sphere of life:** Ethical obligations are shaped by calling - family, church, state, profession - each accountable to divine law.
- **Law and Gospel relation:** Law condemns and guides; gospel renews and enables obedience.
- **Moral ontology:** Ethical identity shaped by created order, fall, and redemption rather than by abstract duties.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed moral categories (covenant, law, sin, grace).
 - As a **polemic** against liberal and pietistic ethical systems that divorce doctrine from practice.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for applying biblical law to social orders and institutions.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the integration of dogmatics and ethics, especially on issues of will, responsibility, providence, and justice.
