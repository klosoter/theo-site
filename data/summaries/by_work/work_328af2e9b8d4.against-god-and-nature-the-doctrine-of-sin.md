### TITLE
Against God and Nature: The Doctrine of Sin - Thomas H. McCall (IVP Academic). 
A systematic-theological treatment of sin that revisits classical Reformed and Augustinian resources in conversation with contemporary biblical studies and analytic philosophy.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical/Reformed theological milieu; engages historical theology (Augustine, Calvin), modern systematicians, biblical exegesis, and analytic philosophy of action and moral psychology.
 - A corrective to reductionist accounts of sin that derive chiefly from psychology, sociology, or secular ethics; aims to recover a robust doctrinal center for Christian moral anthropology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sin should be defined and understood as a moral rebellion that is fundamentally *against God* and thereby *contrary to the ordered nature of creation*. This double characterization preserves both the personal offense against God and the disordering of creaturely flourishing.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical groundwork: survey of biblical data on sin (fall narratives, Psalms, prophetic indictments, Pauline anthropology).
 - Historical retrieval: examines Augustine, medieval and Reformed accounts to extract resources and tensions (privatio boni, willful rebellion, imputation).
 - Philosophical clarification: employs analytic categories to clarify agency, culpability, intention, and the metaphysics of moral disorder.
 - Constructive proposal: offers a composite definition emphasizing voluntary turning away from God, culpable disordering of the affections and will, and resulting relational and structural consequences (guilt, corruption, alienation).
 - Pastoral and doctrinal consequences: implications for original sin, imputation, atonement, sanctification, and ecclesial practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Augustine, key medieval formulations, Calvin and Reformed confessional traditions.
 - Modern/contemporary: selected systematicians and ethicists in the Reformed and evangelical worlds; analytic philosophers of action and moral responsibility.
 - Biblical scholars for textual anchors in Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, and Paul.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (nature, origin, forms), original sin and human depravity, guilt and pollution, imputation and federal headship (implications), atonement (soteriological consequences), grace, sanctification, creation/nature and providence.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: sin is at once a personal affront to God and a perversion of creaturely ends - only a doctrine that holds both aspects can account for guilt, corruption, and the need for redemption.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Articulates a *bipolar* account: sin as both *against God* (relational/forensic) and *against nature* (teleological/order-disordering).
 - Stresses the will and affections as primary loci of sin, not merely cognitive error or social malfunction.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against the Augustinian/Scholastic tendency to reduce sin to a mere privation by insisting on positive, volitional rebellion.
 - Corrects modern naturalistic or therapeutic accounts that downplay divine offense and culpability.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Integrative language that bridges forensic (guilt, imputation) and teleological (disorder of creaturely ends) vocabularies for sin.
 - Uses analytic distinctions (agency, intentionality, moral responsibility) to sharpen historic doctrines.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed academic circles as a careful, usable account that dialogues well with both historical theology and contemporary philosophy.
 - Used by pastors and teachers seeking a robust doctrine of sin that speaks to both forensic and ethical-pastoral concerns.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies contested terms and preserves doctrinal balance; valuable for seminary instruction, doctrinal formulation, and pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sin** - morally culpable turning away from God; both offense and disorder.
- **Against God** - emphasizes relational/forensic dimension: guilt, alienation, offense against divine sovereignty and holiness.
- **Against nature** - emphasizes teleological disorder: perversion of created ends and flourishing.
- **Privation theory** - historical notion (sin as lack); McCall critiques reductionist forms while retrieving its insight about defect.
- **Volitional/affectional account** - locates primary sinfulness in will and loves rather than mere cognitive error.
- **Original sin** - inherited corruption and propensity to sin; analyzed for causal and forensic implications.
- **Imputation** - forensic language for guilt/credit; explored in relation to federal headship and Christology.
- **Guilt and pollution** - distinction between legal guilt and existential/ontological corruption.
- **Agency and culpability** - analytic tools to clarify responsibility, foreknowledge, and consent.
- **Disordered loves** - moral-psychological description of how sin manifests in affections and priorities.
- **Atheological consequences (atonement, sanctification)** - how this doctrine shapes soteriology and pastoral care.
- **Natural law/creation order** - used to explain how sin distorts creaturely goods and moral norms.
- **Federal headship** - used as an interpretive frame for original sin and corporate identity.
- **Teleology** - framework for understanding 'against nature' as contrary to God-given ends.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a *definition source* for seminaries and systematic chapters on sin and anthropology.
 - As a *polemic* against reductionist therapeutic or sociological accounts of moral failure.
 - As an *exegetical-model* for readings of Genesis and Pauline texts that aim to integrate guilt, corruption, and teleological disorder.
