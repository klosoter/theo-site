### TITLE
Covenant and Dispensational Theologies (article, Perspectives on the Christian Life) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical debate: renewed clash between classical Reformed covenant theology, dispensationalism (especially North American), and newer proposals labeled "progressive covenantalism."
 - Frame writes from a confessional Reformed vantage, engaged in pastoral/educational ministry and apologetics.

- **Central thesis**
 - The principal theological divide is over how Scripture structures God's one redemptive plan: is it best explained by a system of successive dispensations that separate Israel and Church, or by a unifying covenantal framework that emphasizes continuity while recognizing historical progress? Frame defends a robust covenantal reading against dispensational fragmentation and critiques some modern covenantal variants.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Dispensationalism tends to partition redemptive history into distinct legal-covenantal epochs with a sharp Israel/Church divide; this produces hermeneutical and theological distortions (e.g., promises to ethnic Israel).
 - Defense: A covenantal model (classical Reformed) reads Scripture as one unfolding covenant of grace (grounded in covenant of redemption/work) with typology and fulfillment centered on Christ and the church.
 - Engagement with alternatives: Frame interacts with "progressive covenantalism," acknowledging its attempt to correct both extremes but arguing for clearer continuity and doctrinal precision.
 - Practical implications: hermeneutics (typology vs. literalism), ecclesiology (identity of the church), eschatology (nature of promises and consummation), sacraments and the interpretation of Old Testament law and land promises.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opponents or examples: classical dispensationalists (representative theological claims rather than a single author).
 - Allies and resources: Reformed confessional tradition, Vosian redemptive-historical reading, classic federal theologians.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: proponents of progressive covenantalism and those seeking a mediating position.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics, covenant theology (covenant of works/redemption/grace), Christology (fulfillment and typology), ecclesiology (church vs. Israel), eschatology, sacraments as covenant signs.

- **Closing line**
 - Frame situates theologically-effective reading of Scripture in a covenantal unity that preserves promise/fulfillment in Christ, correcting both the atomizing thrust of dispensationalism and the indistinct adjustments of some newer covenantal proposals.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the **unity of God's redemptive purpose** across ages, anchored in Christ and covenantal commitments rather than primarily in chronological "dispensations."
 - Careful attention to hermeneutical method: typology and promise-fulfillment are normative, not ad hoc allegory.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - To dispensationalism: rejects rigid Israel/Church bifurcation and isolated literalism about land and national promises.
 - To some progressive covenantalists: pushes for sharper doctrinal categories (e.g., distinct covenants in their theological roles) to avoid collapsing important theological distinctions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-presentation of classical federal categories with renewed emphasis on covenantal predictability and Christ-centered fulfillment as hermeneutical key.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, pastorally-minded critique of dispensationalism and as a corrective to fuzzy covenantal mediations.
 - Used in teaching to show practical consequences of hermeneutical choices for preaching, sacraments, and eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how covenantal commitments shape biblical interpretation and pastoral practice; serves as an accessible bridge between historical theology and contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dispensationalism**
 - System dividing redemptive history into distinct administrations; emphasizes ethnic Israel, future earthly kingdom, and literal fulfillment of OT promises.
- **Progressive Covenantalism**
 - Recent proposal stressing historical progression of covenants; tries to mediate continuity and discontinuity without classical federal formulations.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The overarching covenantal structure by which God redeems sinners across redemptive history; for Frame, central and Christ-centered.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Redemption**
 - Foundational federal categories explaining pre-fall obligation and intra-Trinitarian agreement to save; used to ground continuity and the logic of promise/fulfillment.
- **Typology**
 - Prefiguration and fulfillment relations between persons/events/institutions of the OT and Christ/Church in the NT; hermeneutical engine for covenant reading.
- **Hermeneutics (literal vs. redemptive-historical)**
 - Contrast between plain-sense, often literalist reading (common in dispensationalism) and a redemptive-historical, covenantal interpretive grid.
- **Israel / Church distinction**
 - Debated boundary: dispensationalists emphasize discontinuity; Frame affirms unity of God's people across covenants while permitting typological distinctions.
- **Promise and Fulfillment**
 - How OT promises are actualized in Christ and the church; a primary measure of any system's biblical fidelity.
- **Eschatology**
 - Varied end-time frameworks hinge on covenantal or dispensational presuppositions; Frame emphasizes consummation in Christ rather than separate national future for Israel.
- **Sacraments / Signs**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper interpreted covenantally as continuations/fulfillments of OT signs (e.g., circumcision, Passover).
- **Redemptive History**
 - The narrative sweep of Scripture interpreted as covenantal progression toward Christ.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contrasting covenantal and dispensational hermeneutics in classroom settings.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational partitioning and against vague covenantal compromises.
 - As an **exegetical model** favoring typological, Christ-centered readings of OT promise and fulfillment.
