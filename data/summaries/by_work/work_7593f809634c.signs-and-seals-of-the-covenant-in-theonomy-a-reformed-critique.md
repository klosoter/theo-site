### TITLE
Signs and Seals of the Covenant (essay by Vern Poythress) - in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th century Reformed debate; contribution to a collected volume critiquing theonomy (legalist application of Mosaic law); addresses sacramental theology within contemporary evangelical/Reformed controversies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** sacraments (baptism and the Lord's Supper) function as covenantal **signs and seals**: they are God-ordained visible signs that confirm and assure the covenant promises and are genuine means by which God graciously strengthens faith - neither magical instruments that operate apart from God's promise nor mere human memorials.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define and distinguish **sign** (visible element) and **seal** (assurance function) within covenant language.
 - Exegete biblical passages that ground sacramental practice in covenant promise (e.g., household baptisms, Lord's Supper texts) showing continuity of sign-function across Testaments.
 - Argue for a middle path: sacramental efficacy is real and objective because God promises to use them, but it is not automatic (ex opere operato); faith and the Spirit's work remain necessary.
 - Apply semiotic and linguistic clarity to avoid confusions: signs point to realities, seals warrant promises, and God is the primary agent who binds sign and reality.
 - Contrast Reformed confessional formulations with Roman Catholic sacramentalism and Zwinglian memorialism, locating the Reformed position as covenantal instrumentalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** appeals to Scripture, Reformed confessions (Westminster/Heidelberg), Calvin and classical Reformed theology; engages contemporary theonomy proponents and critics of sacramental robustness (implicit interlocutors include both legalist and pietist tendencies).
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant theology (central), sacramentology, ecclesiology, justification/faith, Christology (presence in sacraments), revelation and promise, role of the Holy Spirit.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Sacraments are covenantal signs and seals by which God, through promise and Spirit, objectively confirms and subjectively strengthens the believer's union with Christ - efficacious because God promises to use them, not because of any inherent power in the elements.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sharp semiotic attention: a tight distinction between sign (visible token) and seal (assurance function) tied to covenant speech acts.
 - Emphasis on God as primary communicator: sacraments are communicative acts of God within covenantal language rather than human rites primarily.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic tendencies toward sacramental automaticity (ex opere operato) by insisting on promise-based efficacy and the necessity of faith.
 - Corrects extreme memorialist/Zwinglian reductions by insisting sacraments do more than memorialize - they convey covenant assurance and strengthen faith objectively.
 - Pushes back on any theonomic or legalist reinterpretation that would reduce sacraments to mere signs of law-keeping or juridical markers.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Use of analytic/semiotic vocabulary to clarify traditional confessional categories (sign, seal, instrument, promise).
 - Recasting "means of grace" language to emphasize God's agency in joining visible signs to invisible realities via covenant promise.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles for clarifying sacramental theology without falling into sacramentalism or minimalism.
 - Cited in discussions aiming to recover confessional sacramentology with clear analytic categories; used pedagogically in seminary contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a concise, defensible Reformed account that is both biblical and philosophically clear; useful as a corrective against both Catholic and radical Protestant extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign:** the visible element (water, bread, cup) that points to an invisible reality; functions communicatively within the covenant.
- **Seal:** the function of the sacrament to confirm and assure the promise given in the covenant.
- **Sacrament/Ordinance:** God-ordained rite that is both sign and seal; distinction maintained from mere human ceremony.
- **Means of Grace:** instruments through which God graciously strengthens faith; efficacy grounded in God's promise and Spirit-work.
- **Covenant:** the overarching theological framework that explains sacramental function; sacraments enact covenantal speech acts.
- **Efficacy:** how sacraments effect their purpose - not intrinsic to elements, but real because God binds sign to promise.
- **Ex opere operato:** term rejected in the Catholic sense; Poythress affirms non-automatic, promise-dependent efficacy.
- **Memorialism:** the view sacraments are only commemorative; critiqued as inadequate to account for covenantal assurance.
- **Visible/Invisible Church:** visible signs correspond to invisible realities (faith, regeneration) within covenant community.
- **Union with Christ:** sacramental sign/seal signify and strengthen the believer's participation in Christ.
- **Presence (spiritual/real):** affirms real spiritual presence without endorsing a physicalistic presence; presence tied to Christ's promise and Spirit.
- **Faith:** necessary response for sacramental benefit; sacraments strengthen and confirm faith but do not replace it.
- **Promise-language:** key hermeneutical frame - sacraments operate because God promises to use them as instruments.
- **Instrumental causality:** sacraments as instruments God uses, not independent causes of grace.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed sacramental categories (sign vs seal; means of grace).
- As a **polemic** resource against both sacramentalism (automatic efficacy) and extreme memorialism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading sacramental texts within covenant theology and aligning confessional formulations with analytic clarity.
