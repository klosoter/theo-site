### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Types - Patrick Fairbairn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Scottish Reformed context (Fairbairn, Free Church of Scotland). Written against the backdrop of rising German critical and rationalist readings of the Old Testament and a continuing Reformed patristic and Calvinian typological tradition. Part of a broader Victorian recovery and systematization of biblical typology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Typology is a divinely ordained, objective law of revelation: Old Testament persons, institutions, and events are intentional "types" whose true meaning and destiny is found in their antitype, ultimately Christ. Proper typology preserves historical reality while securing Christocentric interpretation and covenant continuity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and philosophical-theological grounding of "type" vs. mere resemblance or allegory.
 - Criteria for authentic typology (divine institution, prefiguration, formal correspondence, Scriptural attestation).
 - Systematic survey: persons (Adam, Melchizedek, David), institutions (sacrifice, priesthood, tabernacle), events (Passover, Exodus) as types.
 - Demonstration that Christ is the true antitype who unifies and perfects mutable types.
 - Theological implications for covenant theology, sacramentology, and the continuity of revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Fairbairn draws on patristic and Reformation typologists (Augustine, Calvin), engages critically with allegorizing interpreters and modern rationalist/critical positions, and reads Scripture with a canonical, Christ-centered hermeneutic rather than speculative harmonizing.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics), Covenant (continuity and development), Christology (the antitype and fulfillment), Soteriology, Ecclesiology (sacraments, ministry), and the threefold office (Munus Triplex - prophetic, priestly, kingly).
- **Closing line:** Typology, properly defined and regulated, is the hermeneutical engine by which the covenantal history of Israel is seen as progressively disclosing and culminating in Christ, the single antitype who unites and perfects the divinely instituted figures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Treats typology as a normative theological principle - a law of divine progression - not merely a rhetorical or devotional device.
 - Strong insistence on objective criteria (institution by God, substantial analogy, prophetic intention) to avoid arbitrary allegory.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects patristic over-allegorization (e.g., Origen) by anchoring types in historical divine intent.
 - Opposes reductive rationalist readings that dismiss typological correspondence as mere coincidence or post facto imposition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic rules for identifying genuine types and distinguishing them from "shadows" or metaphorical resemblances.
 - Integration of typology into broader covenantal and Christological theology rather than treating it as an exegetical curiosity.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical biblical-theological circles in the 19th and early 20th centuries.
 - Provided a corrective model for later theologians seeking to defend a Christocentric reading of the OT against liberal criticism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear hermeneutical criteria and systematic examples make Fairbairn a perennial pedagogical resource for training in biblical theology and preaching.
 - Useful bridge between historical-critical awareness and confessional, redemptive-historical exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Type:** An Old Testament person, institution, or event intentionally instituted by God to prefigure an antitype.
- **Antitype:** The fulfillment or reality foreshadowed by the type; for Fairbairn, ultimately Christ.
- **Shadow:** A weaker, preparatory representative of the antitype; often used for ceremonial aspects that point forward.
- **Figure (figura):** A broader, descriptive term overlapping with "type" but emphasizing likeness and pedagogical function.
- **Law of Types:** Fairbairn's conceptual claim that typology is a regular, divinely ordered principle of revelation.
- **Munus Triplex (threefold office):**
 - The prophetic, priestly, and kingly offices as overarching antitypal categories fulfilled in Christ.
 - Types: prophets (Moses, Samuel), priests (Aaron, Melchizedek figure), kings (David); typology illuminates Christ's integrated office.
- **Divine institution:** Criterion: authentic types are established by God (not merely human customs).
- **Prolepsis:** The anticipatory character of types - future reality present in symbol or event.
- **Typical relation:** The specific correspondence between type and antitype (substance over mere resemblance).
- **Allegory (contrast):** Arbitrary spiritualization that Fairbairn rejects in favor of grounded typological rules.
- **Covenant continuity:** Use of typology to argue theological continuity between Israel's history and the church.
- **Sacramental typology:** Use of rites (Passover, circumcision) as prefigurative signs pointing to Christ and Christian sacraments.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional and methodological source for typology and redemptive-historical hermeneutics.
- As an exegetical model to justify Christocentric readings of OT persons/events without collapsing historicity.
- As a polemical resource against rationalist denial of typological correspondences and against unchecked allegory.
