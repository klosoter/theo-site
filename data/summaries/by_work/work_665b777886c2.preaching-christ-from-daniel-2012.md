### TITLE
Preaching Christ from Daniel (Sidney Greidanus, 2012)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2012 amid renewed interest in Christocentric preaching within evangelical and Reformed homiletics.
 - Follows Greidanus's earlier foundational work on preaching Christ from the Old Testament; addresses a canonical book with strong apocalyptic and prophetic content.
 - Theological milieu: conservative evangelical/ Reformed preaching circles grappling with historical-critical methods, typology debates, and pastoral application of apocalyptic texts.

- **Central thesis**
 - Daniel is a valid and rich source for preaching Christ; preachers should read Daniel both in its historical-contextual sense and canonically, using legitimate typological and fulfillment connections that the New Testament warrants.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Prefatory material on principles of Christocentric interpretation and homiletical responsibility (hermeneutical rules, preacher's warrant).
 - Exegetical and Christological treatment of Daniel's major units (e.g., dreams, visions, court narratives, apocalyptic chapters), showing how each points forward to Christ as the promised divine deliverer and eschatological king.
 - Practical homiletical outcomes: sermon outlines, preaching strategies for apocalyptic imagery, pastoral applications.
 - Appendices and sample sermons illustrating method in practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the New Testament as the primary warrant for reading the Old Testament Christologically (e.g., NT use of Daniel in the Gospels, Hebrews, Revelation).
 - Dialogues implicitly with historical-critical scholarship that resists messianic or Christocentric readings, and with traditions that over-allegorize OT text.
 - Conversant with evangelical commentators and homileticians (canonical criticism, typology advocates).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (hermeneutics, canonical reading).
 - Christology (pre-existence, Son of Man, messianic fulfillment).
 - Typology and promise-fulfillment.
 - Eschatology (kingdom, judgment, "seventy weeks" considerations).
 - Indirectly: covenantal themes, angelology, prophecy.

- **Closing line**
 - Greidanus argues that faithful preaching must allow Daniel to speak both historically and theologically toward Christ, permitting legitimate typology and NT-warranted fulfillment as central to pastoral proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Practical orientation: integrates rigorous exegesis with sermon construction; the text is a preacher's manual as much as a theological study.
 - Methodical hermeneutical rules for when and how to preach Christ from OT material, applied specifically to apocalyptic literature.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters a purely historical-critical approach that severs the Old Testament from its christological fulfillment.
 - Rejects indiscriminate allegorizing: insists on New Testament attestation or clear typological analogy for Christological readings.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and operationalizes categories such as "promissory passages," "anticipatory types," and "New Testament warrants" for eschatological texts.
 - Emphasizes a graded warrant model: stronger warrant where NT explicitly cites Daniel; weaker but legitimate warrant where analogy and typological criteria are met.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed preaching training and seminary homiletics courses.
 - Influential among pastors seeking canonical and Christ-centered approaches to OT prophecy and apocalyptic texts.
 - Critiqued by some scholars who argue Greidanus sometimes privileges theological reading over historical-critical nuance; defended by those prioritizing preaching task and NT interpretive authority.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable model for marrying exegesis and preaching in apocalyptic literature.
 - Serves as a practical template for preaching Christ from difficult prophetic material without lapsing into proof-texting or eisegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christocentric preaching** - preaching that places Christ as the integrative center of Scripture; theological and homiletical commitment.
- **New Testament warrant** - the criterion that NT citation or interpretive practice legitimizes reading an OT passage as Christological.
- **Typology** - persons/events in Daniel that prefigure Christ; treated with controls (historical analogy, canonical fulfillment).
- **Promissory passages** - texts in Daniel understood as God's promises that find ultimate fulfillment in Christ.
- **Fulfillment** - the hermeneutical relationship between OT anticipation and NT realization; graded by strength of warrant.
- **Canonical interpretation** - reading Daniel within the full scope of Scripture and the church's canonical confession.
- **Literal-historical sense** - the initial exegetical step; Greidanus insists on understanding historical context before typological move.
- **Apocalyptic imagery** - symbolic language (beasts, horns, Ancient of Days, Son of Man) that requires theological and pastoral interpretation.
- **Son of Man motif** - central Christological figure in Daniel tied to Jesus' self-designation; primary focus for preaching.
- **Ancient of Days** - divine imagery read as background to Christ's eschatological kingship in canonical argument.
- **Seventy weeks** - Daniel 9 interpreted with caution: historical/diachronic exegesis followed by Christological fulfillment claims.
- **Preacher's warrant** - ethical-hermeneutical responsibility to justify Christological claims to a congregation.
- **Antitype** - the New Testament fulfillment or climactic reality to which Daniel's types point.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for methodological norms in Christ-centered OT preaching (especially apocalyptic).
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating stepwise movement from historical sense to canonical Christological application.
 - As a **homiletical resource**-provides sermon outlines and sample sermons for use in preaching Daniel.
 - As a **polemic** against readings that detach Daniel from its messianic and eschatological culmination in Christ.
