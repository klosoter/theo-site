### TITLE
A Clear and Present Word - Mark D. Thompson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/Reformed context reacting to late 20th-early 21st century challenges to propositional revelation (postmodern hermeneutics, neo-orthodoxy, and skeptical Bible criticism). A pastoral-theological intervention addressing church practice, preaching, and catechesis as much as academic apologetics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture is **sufficiently clear (perspicuous)** for its saving purposes; clarity is ecclesial and functional rather than naive literalism. The book defends the tractable intelligibility of God's Word against claims that Scripture is essentially opaque or only mediated through extra-biblical authorities.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical-theological case: rehearses the Reformers and Reformed confessions on perspicuity and the church's reception of Scripture.
 - Philosophical and hermeneutical critique: responds to postmodern relativism and neo-orthodox stress on the event of the Word by defending propositional content and intelligibility.
 - Biblical-exegetical support: demonstrates scriptural patterns that assume ordinary understanding (parables, commands, gospel proclamation).
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: connects clarity to preaching, catechism, communal reading, and ordinary means of grace; insists on Spirit-wrought illumination but resists privatizing interpretation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformers (especially Calvin), historic Reformed confessions (Westminster, Belgic), classical Protestant theologians; interlocution with neo-orthodoxy and Barthian emphases, contemporary hermeneutical skepticism, and trends in biblical criticism. Frequent appeal to biblical texts and pastoral sources rather than extended engagement with continental theory.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration; authority and perspicuity of Scripture; illumination and the Spirit; hermeneutics and preaching; the church as interpretive community; nexus with covenant and catechesis.
- **Closing line:** Theologically robust and pastorally attentive, Thompson insists that the Bible is a "clear and present" divine word - accessible to the ordinary reader in the essentials of salvation while requiring communal, Spirit-led exercise for fuller understanding.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Perspicuity framed as **ecclesial and functional**: clarity is exercised in the life of the church (preaching, catechesis, sacraments), not merely an abstract epistemic claim.
 - Balances propositional content with the dynamic event of hearing: affirms propositional truth without reducing Scripture to mere information.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against neo-orthodox portrayals of Scripture as primarily an event that undermines propositional content; preserves both event and propositional revelation.
 - Corrects naive literalism by distinguishing **necessary/essential teachings** for salvation from disputable secondary matters.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasis on the term **"present"** - the Word's contemporaneous address - linking clarity to accessibility in ordinary means rather than esoteric illumination alone.
 - Clarifies "clarity" as a pastoral hermeneutical virtue, not merely a doctrinal proposition.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Has been used within Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a succinct defense of perspicuity and as a resource for pastors and catechists.
 - Modest academic impact compared with larger systematic treatments, but valued for clarity and pastorally oriented argumentation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful corrective to both skeptical hermeneutics and credulous literalism.
 - Serves as a compact bridge between doctrinal theology and pastoral practice, especially for courses on doctrine of Scripture and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perspicuity (clarity of Scripture):** Scripture is clear in its saving message; clarity depends on the text's ordinary intelligibility and the church's interpretive life.
- **Present Word:** The idea that Scripture addresses readers here-and-now; the Word is contemporaneous and practically accessible.
- **Illumination:** The Spirit's enabling of understanding; necessary but not a private, mystical key that bypasses ordinary means.
- **Propositional revelation:** Scriptural truth claims that can be expressed and taught; defended against anti-propositional readings.
- **Event vs. Content:** Balances the "Word as event" (hearing, encounter) with "Word as propositional content."
- **Necessary vs. Contingent matters:** Distinguishes essentials for salvation (clearly revealed) from secondary theological disputes.
- **Ecclesial hermeneutic:** Interpretation happens primarily within the life and practices of the church (preaching, catechesis, sacraments).
- **Sola Scriptura (functional):** Reaffirms Scripture's normative and decisive role in doctrine while acknowledging interpretive practices.
- **Catechesis and preaching:** Treated as ordinary means by which clarity is exercised and sustained.
- **Hermeneutical humility:** Encourages confident assent to essentials while modesty on complex texts.
- **Canonical coherence:** Emphasizes reading individual passages within canonical teaching to preserve clarity.
- **Ordinary means of grace:** The avenues through which the Word is made present and intelligible to sinners (sermon, sacraments, instruction).
- **Analogy of faith:** Use of Scripture to interpret Scripture; thematic coherence secures clarity.
- **Church as interpretive community:** The church mediates and safeguards the clarity of the Word.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** on perspicuity in courses on doctrine of Scripture.
 - As a **polemic** against postmodern and neo-orthodox criticisms that relativize propositional content.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching, catechesis, and formation - a practical guide linking doctrine to ministry.
