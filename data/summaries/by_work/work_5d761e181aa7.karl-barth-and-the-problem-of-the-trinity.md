### TITLE
Karl Barth and the Problem of the Trinity - Bruce McCormack

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Barth scholarship seeking to locate Barth's trinitarian theology within both classical dogmatics and modern theological critique.
 - Reaction to post-war systematic theology debates: neo-scholastic Thomism, Rahnerian transcendental theology, and emerging social-trinitarian readings.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - McCormack argues Barth offers a decisive reformulation of the Trinity: he refuses to treat the immanent Trinity as ontologically prior to God's revelatory action (the economic Trinity). Barth thereby reconceives the relation between God's inner life and God's self-disclosure in history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological reconstruction of Barth's engagement with classical and modern sources (esp. Augustine, Aquinas, Schleiermacher, Rahner).
 - Analysis of Barth's method: Christocentric, dialectical, and revelation-first orientation.
 - Exegesis of Barthian texts to show how Barth denies any autonomous immanent Trinity antecedent to God's action in Jesus Christ.
 - Contrast with Rahner's "rule" and with social-trinitarian and analogical-theology tendencies.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth (various Church Dogmatics loci).
 - Interlocutors: Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), Augustine, Aquinas, Schleiermacher, modern social-trinitarian critics.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation, Christology, doctrine of God (immanence/economy), theological epistemology (how God is known), analogia fide/entis.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Barth reconceives the Trinity not as an ontological datum awaiting theological description but as the form and content of God's self-revelation in Christ; theology must think the inner life of God only under the lordship of the Christ-event.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - **Revelation-first Trinity:** The economic (God's self-revelation) is the decisive criterion for any talk of the immanent Trinity; there is no autonomous immanent Trinity antecedent to Christ.
 - **Christocentric ontology:** Trinitarian ontology is shaped by Christological revelation - the persons are known as revelatory modes in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - **Against Rahner's Rule:** McCormack explicates Barth's challenge to Rahner's axiom that the economic and immanent Trinity are essentially identical in explanatory priority. Barth refuses the epistemic and metaphysical move that lets speculative theology infer an unconditioned, inner-life ontology apart from revelation.
 - **Against social trinitarianism:** Barth's relational language is not a straightforward social ontology; relations are oriented by God's self-giving, not by mutual sociality as primary.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on **revelatory relations** (persons as modes of self-giving) rather than an a priori ontological trias.
 - Stress on **God's freedom** - God decides to be God in the act of revelation; this upends static ontological accounts.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Renewed interest in a distinctively Barthian trinitarianism that resists both speculative metaphysics and reduction to social metaphors.
 - Influential for conservative Reformed retrievals and for trinitarian studies that prioritize revelation and Christology.
 - Provoked pushback from Rahnerian and social-trinitarian scholars who defend stronger identity between economy and immanent life.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how trinitarian doctrine can be disciplined by biblical Christology and by a theology of revelation; remains a pivotal corrective to speculative extrapolations about God's inner life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rahner's Rule**
 - The heuristic that the economic Trinity reveals the immanent Trinity (often formulated as their identity); McCormack shows Barth resists its speculative extension.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's triune self-disclosure in history, especially in Christ; for Barth this is primary and determinative for talk about God.
- **Immanent Trinity**
 - The inner life of God "in se"; Barth treats claims about this as derivative and only justifiable insofar as anchored in revelation.
- **Revelation-first / Christocentrism**
 - The governing methodological stance: knowledge and doctrine of God are anchored in Christ's revelation.
- **Person / Relation (Barthian sense)**
 - Persons named by their revelatory roles and acts (Father as origin in revelation, Son as revelation, Spirit as witness/appropriation) rather than as pre-existing social relata.
- **Freedom of God**
 - God's decision to reveal and to be God; opposes necessary ontological models that undermine divine freedom.
- **Analogia fide vs. analogia entis**
 - Barth rejects analogia entis (analogy of being); McCormack stresses Barth's reliance on analogy of faith grounded in revelation.
- **Dialectical theology**
 - Method that holds a tension between God's transcendence and self-disclosure; Barth uses this to avoid speculative collapse into either pantheism or purely immanent ontology.
- **Form of knowledge of God**
 - How God is known - not by natural theology discovering inner life but by faithful reception of the revelatory event.
- **Social Trinitarianism (as foil)**
 - The position that highlights interpersonal relations as constitutive; Barth's reformulation resists reducing persons to social counterparts.
- **Christ-event as ontological locus**
 - The event (incarnation, cross, resurrection) functions as the decisive locus where God's triune identity is disclosed.
- **Theological epistemology**
 - How theological claims about God are validated; McCormack emphasizes Barth's insistence on revelation as epistemic ground.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a revelation-first, Barthian account of the Trinity within dogmatics.
 - As a **polemic** against Rahnerian identification of economic and immanent Trinity and against speculative/social reductions.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking Christology and doctrine of God: useable in preaching, systematic dogmatics, and ecumenical trinitarian dialogues.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for Reformed retrievals that insist doctrine of God is disciplined by Gospel-centered revelation.
