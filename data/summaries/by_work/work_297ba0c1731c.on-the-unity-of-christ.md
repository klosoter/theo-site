### TITLE
**On the Unity of Christ - Cyril of Alexandria**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 5th century (principal writings around 428-433). Alexandrian theological milieu; reaction to Antiochene emphases and the teaching of Nestorius and Theodore of Mopsuestia. Immediate ecclesiastical context: controversies leading to the Council of Ephesus (431).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Defend the absolute personal unity of the Word-incarnate: there is one Son, one Person (hypostasis) in whom two natures (divine and human) are united without confusion. This unity preserves both the reality of the incarnation and the intelligible attribution of actions and properties.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the eternal **Sonship** of the Logos and its entrance into history by the real incarnation (Eternal Sonship and Incarnation).
 - Opposition to any account that splits the bearer of personhood (prosopon/hypostasis) into two subjects - critique aimed at Nestorius and Antiochene separatism.
 - Formulation of a single incarnate reality: famous (and disputed) locution "mia physis tou theou logou sesarkomene" - often rendered "one incarnate nature of the Word of God" - intended to express the unity of the Word with the assumed human nature (Hypostatic Union).
 - Robust application of predicate attribution (Communicatio Idiomatum): because the Word is the single subject, divine and human properties may be predicated of the one person.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Nestorius, Theodore of Mopsuestia (Antiochene school). Appeals to Alexandrian tradition (Athanasius) and scriptural exegesis.
 - Councils: his positions shaped the Council of Ephesus (431) and provoked later clarification at Chalcedon (451).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, hypostatic union), Trinity (eternal Son), soteriology (mediatorial action), and the grammar of predication in theological language.
- **Closing line**
 - Cyril centers Christology on the **one personal subject** - the eternal Word who becomes incarnate - thus securing the coherence of salvation-history language by making the Person, not nature, the primary bearer of actions and titles.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Person-priority: Cyril insists the primary question is "Who is the acting subject?" not merely "what natures are present." This undergirds his strong communicative account of properties.
 - The controversial phrase **"one incarnate nature of the Word"** expresses unity of subsistence rather than an ontological fusion of natures.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Antiochene tendency to hypostatize the human nature into a distinct subject (Nestorian separation). Contrasts with overly abstract Chalcedonian dual-nature emphasis by insisting on personal unity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advances proto-hypostatic union language that shapes later technical vocabulary (hypostasis, prosopon, physis used with new relational nuance).
 - Strong, systematic use of the **communicatio idiomatum** to ground scriptural ascriptions (e.g., "God suffered" as predicated of the one incarnate Person).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Eastern and Western churches adopted Cyril's insistence on unity as corrective to Nestorianism. Chalcedon later formulated a two-nature doctrine that sought to preserve Cyril's personal unity while clarifying language; some Alexandrian followers saw Chalcedon as both confirmation and necessary supplementation.
 - Reformed and later Protestant theologians draw on Cyril for his person-centered Christology and for pastoral-soteriological applications, while preferring Chalcedonian technical language.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating biblical exegesis with ontological claims about Personhood; indispensable for teaching a Christology that maintains both full divinity and true humanity without schism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostasis**
 - Cyril's preferred term for the concrete person; decisive in arguing there is one subject of the incarnate life.
- **Physis (nature)**
 - Used to designate constitutive principles (divine, human); Cyril's "one incarnate physis" phrase must be read in light of his person-focused intent.
- **Prosopon (person/face)**
 - Employed to oppose a two-subject reading of Christ; prosopon indexes the concrete personal reality that bears predicates.
- **Logos (the Word)**
 - Eternal Son who assumes human nature; key to linking eternal Sonship and historical incarnation.
- **Eternal Sonship and Incarnation**
 - Cyril affirms the Son's eternal relation to the Father and that this same Son is the subject of incarnation - continuity of person across eternity and history.
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Cyril's constructive account of union: two natures united in one hypostasis without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Chalcedonian Definition and Two Natures Doctrine**
 - Chalcedon later reframes Cyril's insights in the formula "two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably united"; Cyril is a primary source for its insistence on unity.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - Strong Cyrilian usage: properties of either nature may be attributed to the one Person because the Word is the acting subject.
- **Appropriation**
 - Cyril often appropriates divine works to the incarnate Word and human actions to the one Person, shaping liturgical and soteriological language.
- **Predication**
 - Methodological rule: predicates must be ascribed to the person who is the subject, avoiding abstract stacking of separate natures.
- **Antiochene vs Alexandrian contrast**
 - Use Cyril to study the contrast: Antioch emphasizes distinction of natures; Cyril emphasizes personal unity.
- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for person-unity in Christology and a key antecedent to Chalcedon.
 - As a **polemic** against Nestorian separations, used in ecclesial and confessional disputes.
 - As an **exegetical model** for attributing predicates in Gospel/Pauline texts and for pastoral proclamation of the Incarnation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology for integrating soteriology, anthropology, and Trinitarian metaphysics.
