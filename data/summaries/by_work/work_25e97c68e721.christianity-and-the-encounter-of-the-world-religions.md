### TITLE
Christianity and the Encounter of the World Religions - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Protestant theology; Tillich writing after World War II in the context of increasing global religious awareness, nascent interreligious dialogue, and the Cold War intellectual climate.
 - Part of Tillich's later corpus where his systematic-correlational method is applied to comparative religion and culture. Intersects the mid-century "Christ and culture" debate (see: "Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective").
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity must be understood as the **event of revelation** in which the ultimate ground of being addresses human "ultimate concern"; other religions are partial, symbolic responses to the same depths. The theological problem is negotiating **particularity vs. universality**: how Christ can be the unique center of revelation while other religions retain existential and symbolic truth.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: all religions are human responses to estrangement and finite existence; they function as symbolic systems pointing beyond themselves.
 - Method: apply the **correlation method**-correlate existential human questions with the Christian answer (revelation in Christ) to evaluate other religions.
 - Judgment: other religions contain authentic revelatory elements and structures of meaning, but are historically and ontologically partial.
 - Fulfillment: Christ is the decisive **eschatological** disclosure that calls for transformation; Christianity's claims are universal in depth (not necessarily in all historical/formal expressions).
 - Pastoral implication: respect for religious others without collapsing Christian distinctiveness into relativism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages modern existentialism (Kierkegaard, Heidegger), liberal Protestantism, and critiques/contrasts with Barthian dogmatics and classical theism. Dialogues indirectly with Niebuhr's Christ-and-culture typology by supplying an eschatological and ontological frame.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (event, symbol), Christology (Christ as ultimate revelation/eschatological center), soteriology (new being, participation), eschatology (fulfillment and transformation of culture), theology of religions (plurality, partial truth), ontology (Ground of Being), apologetics (critique vs. respect).
- **Closing line**
 - Tillich's center of gravity: Christianity interprets and fulfills the religious intuition of humanity by disclosing the Ground of Being in an eschatological act (Christ), thereby calling all cultures and religions to critical transformation without denying their partial truth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as **correlation** between existential questions and the Christian answer; religion as symbolic, not merely propositional.
 - Insistence on **both/and**: strong affirmation of the truth-value in other religions coupled with an uncompromising claim for Christ's eschatological decisiveness.
 - Ontological framing: revelation occurs in relation to the **Ground of Being**, not a supernatural object separate from existential reality.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with **exclusivist** readings that deny any legitimacy to other religions; also resists naive pluralism that treats all doctrinal forms as equivalent.
 - Moves beyond classical theism (God as highest being) toward a dialectical, existential **God-above-the-God** language and symbolic theology.
 - Differs from Barth by being more open to continuity between natural religion and revelation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Use of **symbolic language** to grant cognitive and non-cognitive value to religious expressions.
 - Reframing Christian uniqueness as **eschatological fulfillment** rather than mere propositional superiority.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in liberal and mainline Protestant circles, comparative theology, and interreligious dialogue; criticized by conservatives for relativism and by some for ontological obscurity.
 - Shaped mid-century conversations about religious pluralism, pastoral theology, and theological method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for reconciling Christian particularity with respect for religious plurality and for teaching theology that is philosophically informed and pastorally sensitive.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ground of Being** - Tillich's ontological name for God; the existential depth that grounds all finite beings; central to understanding revelation as addressing ultimate concern.
- **Ultimate concern** - The felt center of a person's life; religion and theology interpret and answer this concern.
- **Correlation method** - Method of theologizing by correlating existential questions with Christian answers (revelation in Christ).
- **Symbol / symbolic language** - Religious language operates symbolically; symbols participate in what they point to and can be destroyed or replaced.
- **Revelation as event** - Revelation is an existential event (disclosure) rather than merely a set of propositions.
- **Christ as eschatological fulfillment** - Christ is the decisive disclosure that fulfills and judges other religious forms.
- **Partial truth / participation** - Other religions contain participatory and partial truths that point toward ultimate reality but lack finality.
- **God-above-the-God** - Critique of naive theism, affirming a dialectical transcendence that corrects idolatrous conceptions.
- **New Being** - The soteriological outcome of revelation: participation in a transformed mode of existence.
- **Estrangement / anxiety** - Existential diagnosis that motivates religious seeking; theology addresses this human condition.
- **Plurality with critique** - Model for interreligious relations: affirming elements while subjecting all cultural-religious forms to eschatological critique.
- **Eschatological perspective** - Frames history and culture as provisional, oriented toward consummation in the divine disclosure.
- **Participation** - Ontological notion that finite beings can participate in the Ground of Being; used to explicate salvation and sacrament.
- **Comparative theology model** - Tillich provides a method to compare religions without simple reduction or syncretism.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological resource** for theology of religions and comparative theology (model of correlation and symbolic analysis).
 - As a **polemic and corrective** against both exclusivism and naive pluralism in ecclesial teaching and apologetics.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching eschatology, Christology, and pastoral approaches to religious diversity.
