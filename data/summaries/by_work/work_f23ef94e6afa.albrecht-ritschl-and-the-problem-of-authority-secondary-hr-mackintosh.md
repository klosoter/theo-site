### TITLE
Albrecht Ritschl and the Problem of Authority (secondary: H. R. Mackintosh)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; Ritschl as leading figure of the Ritschlian school (Wissenschaftliche Theologie, anti-speculative, pietistic-ethical emphases).
 - Reaction to Hegelian metaphysics and to the liberal-critical movement: attempt to ground theology in historical Christ-event and ethical judgment.
 - H. R. Mackintosh (Scottish, early 20th c.) as primary anglophone secondary commentator and critic; sought to correct perceived Ritschlian deficits while retaining methodological gains.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can Christian authority-of Christ, church, and Scripture-be maintained without recourse to metaphysical speculation or verbal inspiration?
 - Ritschl locates authority in the historical revelation of God in Jesus Christ and in the **ethical-religious life** of the Christian community; he rejects intrinsic or "self-attesting" texts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Revelation is a historical, ethical event: Christ as the determinative revelation of God whose value is recognized by the community.
 - Religious knowledge is a practical value-judgment (Werturteil), not speculative metaphysics; authority issues from communal appropriation of Christ's value.
 - Scripture is authoritative only insofar as it functions as an effective witness to and instrument of the Christ-event within the life of the church.
 - Mackintosh's corrective:
 - Stresses need to safeguard the objectivity of revelation and the role of the Spirit in attestation.
 - Argues for a more robust account of Scripture's normative status-Scripture as the primary witness to revelation with an attendant form of attestation rooted in divine self-disclosure.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Albrecht Ritschl (main works on justification, kingdom of God, Church and Theology).
 - Secondary/critics: H. R. Mackintosh; opponents invoking historical-critical and pietistic positions; Augustinian and orthodox critics accusing Pelagian or semi-Pelagian tendencies.
 - Implicit interlocutors: Kantian epistemology, Hegelianism, 19th-century English and German liberalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Christ-event), authority (of Christ, church, Scripture), justification and atonement (ethical reorientation), ecclesiology (church as moral community), theology-methodology (value-judgment epistemology).

- **Closing line**
 - Ritschl reframes authority from metaphysical certitude to the historical-ethical primacy of Christ recognized by the community; Mackintosh presses back, seeking to re-anchor authority more securely in divine self-disclosure and the Spirit-witness to Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Authority rooted in the *ethical-historical* character of revelation rather than in metaphysical proofs or textual self-authentication.
 - Theology as normative for Christian life: doctrine judged by its efficacy in forming the Christian ethical community.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against speculative metaphysics (Hegel) and abstract natural theology: insists on the particularity of Christ and the church.
 - Opposed to classical Augustinianism's metaphysical account of sin/atonement; accused (and partially responsible) for a move toward moralism in soteriology.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Use of "value-judgment" (Werturteil) as epistemological category for religious knowledge.
 - Emphasis on the church's communal judgment as locus of theological authority.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Protestant continental and British theology (late 19th-early 20th c.); shaped liberal, ethical theologies and debates on the nature of revelation.
 - Criticized by conservatives for seeming Pelagianism and for undermining Scriptural self-attestation; engaged constructively by thinkers like Mackintosh who sought synthesis.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies relation between history, ethics, and authority; valuable for methodological debates about Scripture, experience, and community.
 - Useful corrective to purely propositional or metaphysical accounts of revelation while prompting safeguards against relativism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Value-judgment (Werturteil)** - religious knowledge as evaluative, practical recognition of Christ's ethical worth; epistemic pivot in Ritschl.
- **Christ-event (historical revelation)** - revelation centered in the life, teaching, and reconciling work of Jesus; decisive for authority.
- **Authority of Scripture (derivative)** - scripture's authority is not intrinsic/self-attesting but dependent on its role as community witness to Christ.
 - Contrast: rejects classical self-attestation theories that claim Scripture's internal testimony as sole ground.
- **Self-attestation** - doctrine that Scripture inherently attests to its own authority; emphasized by critics of Ritschl and highlighted in Mackintosh's responses.
- **Kingdom of God (ethical community)** - ecclesial realization of the reconciling order; locus where revelation is actualized and recognized.
- **Grace as moral transformation** - Ritschl's soteriology focuses on ethical renewal over forensic metaphysical categories.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism (accusatory framing)** - labels used by critics to indicate Ritschl's perceived over-emphasis on human moral response; Ritschl insists on necessity of grace but reframes it.
- **Augustinianism (contrast)** - represents metaphysical, guilt-oriented account of sin/atonement; Ritschl departs from its speculative presuppositions.
- **Ecclesial judgment** - community's role in recognizing and sustaining doctrinal authority.
- **Wissenschaftliche Theologie** - Ritschl's methodological commitment to disciplined, critical theology grounded in historical consciousness.
- **Moralism (critique)** - charge that Ritschl reduces religion to ethics; mitigated by his insistence on revelation's uniqueness.
- **H. R. Mackintosh's mediating theology** - retains Ritschlian method but defends a stronger claim for revelation's objectivity and for Scripture's normative witness.
- **Instrumental view of Scripture** - Scripture as instrument that mediates the Christ-event rather than an ontologically self-validating text.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological pivot** in debates on revelation and theology: shows plausibility and risks of grounding authority in historical-ethical categories.
 - As a **polemic source**: cited both by critics (charging Pelagian tendencies; denying self-attestation) and by mediating theologians (e.g., Mackintosh) who seek to retrieve objective revelation while keeping Ritschl's emphases.
