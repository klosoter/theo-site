### TITLE
Calvin and the Holy Scripture - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology. Warfield writes as a conservative Reformed polemicist and historian, defending orthodox doctrines of Scripture against liberal criticism and higher criticism. He reads Calvin (Institutes and commentaries) through the lens of confessional Protestantism and the contemporary crises over authority and inspiration.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Calvin teaches that Scripture's authority is ultimately divine and self-attesting: the Bible authenticates itself by the inward testimony of the Holy Spirit while being reinforced by external evidences and church reception. Warfield's thesis: Calvin presents a balanced doctrine that secures objective authority without reducing Scripture to merely human persuasion or to ecclesiastical fiat.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of Calvin's texts (Institutes, prefaces, commentaries) to show recurring themes: the necessity of Scripture, its sufficiency, and the Spirit's internal witness.
 - Distinction Calvin draws between external proofs (miracles, prophecy, consonance with Christ) and the internal testimony of the Spirit that gives Scripture immediate authority for faith.
 - Emphasis on Calvin's pastoral concern: self-attestation is not abstract epistemology but the Spirit's work to make Scripture effectual for sinners.
 - Polemical contrast: Calvin against Roman reliance on magisterial authority and against rationalist reduction of Scripture to ethical or historical value only.
 - Synthesis: Warfield argues that Calvin's position anticipates and supports later Reformed claims for inerrancy and plenary inspiration while avoiding naïve voluntarism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John Calvin (primary); Augustine (background influence); Roman Catholic magisterial claims; 19th-century rationalists and higher critics (implicit contemporary interlocutors); Warfield's Princeton context and the inerrancy debates.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, inspiration, authority and sufficiency of Scripture, illumination (internal testimony), ecclesiology (reception of Scripture), hermeneutics, also implicates Christology and Trinitarian economy insofar as the Spirit's witness is personal.
- **Closing line:** Warfield presents Calvin as holding Scripture's divine authority to be both objectively grounded and subjectively efficacious: Scripture authentically bears its own witness by the Spirit, securing normative authority for faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stress on **self-attestation** (scripture bears its own divine imprimatur) as Calvin's crucial contribution to a doctrine of authority.
 - Integration of **objective authority** (Scripture as God's Word) with **subjective appropriation** (Spirit's inward testimony), avoiding a false either/or.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against Roman claims that ecclesial magisterium alone authenticates Scripture.
 - Rejection of rationalist/humanist models that make Scripture's authority derivative only from historical or moral worth.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and popularizes the phraseology of Scripture being **"self-authenticating"** in a way that informs later inerrancy and inspiration debates.
 - Differentiates **external proofs** versus **internal testimony** as complementary bases for authority.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as historical grounding for doctrine of inspiration and inerrancy.
 - Influential in Princetonian formulations and later 20th-century confessional defenses; cited in debates over the nature of biblical authority.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise historical-theological recovery of Calvin on Scripture.
 - Models how to read patristic/Reformation texts in contemporary doctrinal controversies without anachronistic reduction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation / self-authenticating Scripture:** The claim that Scripture, by virtue of being God's Word, inherently carries an internal testimony making it authoritative for faith.
- **Internal testimony of the Holy Spirit (testimonium Spiritus Sancti):** The Spirit's work in the believer that produces assurance of Scripture's divine origin and effectual persuasive power.
- **External proofs:** Historical signs, miracles, prophetic fulfillment, and coherence with Christ and salvation history that support Scripture's claim externally.
- **Authority of Scripture:** The normative claim that Scripture commands belief and obedience because it is divinely given.
- **Inspiration:** The doctrine that Scripture is God-breathed; Warfield reads Calvin as endorsing real divine causation of biblical truthfulness.
- **Sufficiency (sola Scriptura implication):** Scripture contains what is necessary for faith and life; Calvin preserves sufficiency against rival authorities.
- **Illumination:** Distinct but related to inspiration; the Spirit enables appropriation and understanding of Scripture by believers.
- **Reception / ecclesial recognition:** The role of the church in identifying and canonizing Scripture without being its ultimate source of authority.
- **Objective vs. subjective grounding:** Objective = Scripture's intrinsic divine character; subjective = the believer's assurance via the Spirit. Warfield stresses their complementarity.
- **Regula fidei (rule of faith):** Scripture as the decisive norm for doctrine and practice, not subordinate creeds or councils.
- **Polemical targets:** Roman magisterial claims, rationalist/higher criticism tendencies that undermine Scripture's authority.
- **Pastoral dimension:** Calvin's concern that doctrine of Scripture serve faith formation, not only abstract assent.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **historical definition source** for Reformed doctrine of Scripture (showing Calvin's position as precedent).
- As a **polemic resource** against liberal, rationalist, or ecclesiocentric models of authority.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** illustrating how to balance internal witness and external grounds when articulating inspiration and authority.
