### TITLE
John Bolt, "Bavinck on Justification by Faith Alone" (secondary) 
- Short study/essay interpreting Herman Bavinck's doctrine of justification as set out in Reformed Dogmatics and related writings. 
- Contemporary Reformed secondary literature oriented to debates about imputation, sola fide, and responses to the New Perspective on Paul (NPP).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 19th / early 20th-century Reformed dogmatics (Herman Bavinck); John Bolt's contemporary retrieval and exposition within current debates over justification (particularly reactions to NPP). Bavinck writes amid Dutch Neo-Calvinism and the aftermath of confessional scholasticism.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Bavinck (as read by Bolt) affirms **justification by faith alone** understood primarily as a forensic declaration grounded in the objective merits of Christ, while maintaining a robust nexus between forensic imputation and real union with Christ so that justification and sanctification are distinct but inseparable aspects of salvation.
- **Core argument / structure:** Bolt reconstructs Bavinck's argument in several moves:
 - Establish the historical-Reformed commitments in Bavinck: sola fide, sola gratia, penal substitution, forensic declaration.
 - Show how Bavinck grounds imputation in the covenantal and federal structure of salvation-Christ as covenant head whose obedience and suffering are reckoned to believers.
 - Demonstrate Bavinck's careful distinction between objective justification (Christ's work and its forensic efficacy) and subjective appropriation (faith), while refusing a purely "external" forensic model divorced from union with Christ.
 - Address contemporary critiques (NPP): Bolt uses Bavinck to argue that covenantal readings and forensic categories are compatible and that Pauline language of righteousness/justification retains forensic force.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Herman Bavinck (primary), Reformation and scholastic sources (Calvin, Bucer, the Synodical confessions), contemporaries in Kuyperian/Reformed circles, and modern interlocutors promoting NPP.
- **Doctrines treated:** justification, imputation (active/passive obedience), union with Christ, covenant theology (federal headship), penal substitution, faith and repentance, sanctification (as distinct but related).
- **Closing line:** Bavinck - as Bolt presents him - defends a classical Reformed, forensic doctrine of justification by faith alone that is both juridical in content and existentially grounded in union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Integrates forensic imputation with **real union**: imputation is not a mere legal fiction but the legal expression of an actual union in Christ.
 - Strong stress on **objective justification** (Christ's work) prior to and distinct from subjective appropriation by faith.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Clarifies and refines scholastic categories to avoid caricatures of "mere legalism"; resists both Roman infusion theories and NPP reduction of justification to covenant membership alone.
 - Distinguishes himself from reductionist readings that separate justification and sanctification as wholly unrelated.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** careful articulation of **double aspect** language - forensic declaration + ontological union - that preserves legal certainty while affirming transformative reality.
- **Reception and influence:** Renewed interest among modern Reformed scholars and pastors as a model for defending sola fide against NPP; influential in evangelical-Reformed dialogue for showing coherence between covenant theology and forensic doctrine.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a balanced, historically rooted template for teaching and defending justification that is doctrinally precise, pastorally sensitive, and exegetically attentive.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** A forensic (legal) declaration by God that a sinner is righteous on account of Christ's merits.
- **Forensic:** Relating to the courtroom metaphor - decisive legal verdict, not merely moral improvement.
- **Imputation:** The reckoning of Christ's righteousness to believers; Bavinck affirms a real accounting rooted in covenant headship.
 - **Double imputation:** Sins imputed to Christ (passive obedience) and Christ's righteousness imputed to believers (active obedience).
- **Sola fide (faith alone):** Faith as the instrument by which believers receive the forensic verdict; faith trusts objective work, not personal merit.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological bond that grounds imputation and links justification to sanctification without collapsing them.
- **Objective justification:** The completed, universal merit of Christ's obedience and atonement as an accomplished legal basis before God.
- **Subjective appropriation:** The personal reception of justification by faith; distinct from, but dependent on, objective justification.
- **Active obedience:** Christ's life of perfect law-keeping whose merit is imputed to believers (Bavinck affirms its forensic relevance).
- **Passive obedience:** Christ's suffering and death bearing the penalty for sin (imputed to Christ).
- **Penal substitution:** The doctrine that Christ bore the penal consequences of sinners; central to Bavinck's forensic account.
- **Covenant headship / federal theology:** The covenantal framework through which Christ represents and secures righteousness for his people.
- **NPP (New Perspective on Paul):** A contemporary set of readings Bolt engages; Bavinck's system is marshaled as a corrective to NPP reductions of forensic language.
- **Sanctification:** Progressive renewal ensuing from union with Christ; distinct from justification but inseparable in the economy of salvation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition/source** for a confessional Reformed account of justification that preserves forensic imputation and union with Christ.
 - As a **polemic** and exegetical resource against NPP positions that minimize forensic categories.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline texts combining forensic language with covenantal theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: shows how juridical and relational categories can be integrated without contradiction.
