### TITLE
Three Views on Israel and the Church: Perspectives on Romans 9-11 - Craig A. Blaising (contribution in volume with Walter C. Kaiser Jr. and Darrell L. Bock)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical debate over Israel, the church, and eschatology.
 - Blaising participates from the vantage of *progressive dispensational / covenantal* scholarship that seeks a middle way between classical dispensationalism and historic covenantal (supersessionist) readings.
 - Conversation framed by wider concerns: hermeneutics (canonical/redemptive-historical), the fate of ethnic Israel, and Paul's theology in Romans 9-11.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's Romans 9-11 defends God's faithfulness to the promises made to Israel while explaining Gentile inclusion in Christ; this requires a theological position that holds **continuity and discontinuity**-promises to Israel are neither nullified nor simply transferred wholesale to the church.
 - The problem: how to account for election, mercy, and eschatological hope for Israel without lapsing into replacementism or severing church/Israel continuity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical close reading of Romans 9-11 emphasizing Paul's use of Scripture, typology, and corporate categories.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Paul's concern for Israel's salvation and his use of election language as corporate and covenantal, not merely individualistic.
 - Treat the olive-tree image (Rom 11) as depicting Gentile inclusion by grafting into the same covenantal family rather than replacement of Israel's promises.
 - Read Israel's current hardening as partial and temporary, producing a remnant by grace; anticipate a future restoration and fulfillment of promises.
 - Frame these developments within a *progressive* outworking of covenantal promises culminating in Christ, where present partial fulfillment coexists with future consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with Kaiser and Bock within the same volume; also engages broader dispensational, covenantal, and redemptive-historical authors.
 - Heavy use of Pauline exegesis, Old Testament proof-texts used by Paul, and canonical/hegemonic interpretation.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election (corporate and covenantal), covenant theology vs. dispensational distinctions, Christology as fulfillment of Israel's role, eschatology (restoration of Israel), ecclesiology (grafting and people of God), soteriology (remnant, mercy).

- **Closing line**
 - Blaising's theological center: God keeps covenantal promises to Israel while bringing Gentiles into the same redemptive family-thus Romans 9-11 requires a theological model of **continuity-in-discontinuity** rooted in progressive covenantal fulfillment rather than wholesale replacement or radical separation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses *corporate election* and covenantal continuity: Israel remains covenantally significant even as the church expands the people of God.
 - Emphasizes *progressive fulfillment*: promises to Israel are realized in stages (partial/initial in Christ and church; final in eschatological restoration).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters classical dispensationalism by refusing an absolute, irreducible separation between Israel and the church.
 - Counters supersessionism by maintaining a genuine future for ethnic Israel and the enduring validity of certain covenantal promises.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of redemptive-historical and canonical categories to nuance the continuity/discontinuity debate; often associated with the language of *progressive dispensationalism* (or progressive covenantal reading of Paul).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among evangelicals seeking a mediating position; cited in debates over supersessionism and in seminary-level discussions on Romans.
 - Served as a model for balanced exegetical treatments that respect both particular promises to Israel and the inclusive claims of the church.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear exegetical methodology for Romans 9-11 emphasizing canonical coherence.
 - Valuable for teaching because it models how to hold theological tensions without collapsing them into extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Romans 9-11** - central exegetical locus; Blaising reads it as the Pauline defense of God's faithfulness to Israel.
- **Olive-tree metaphor (Rom 11)** - grafting language used to describe Gentile inclusion without full replacement of Israel.
- **Remnant** - corporate, covenantal remnant chosen by grace; proof of God's continuing covenant faithfulness.
- **Election (corporate)** - chosen people as a corporate body (Israel/church), not merely individual predestination.
- **Hardening** - partial, temporary judicial hardening of Israel in redemptive-history, not final repudiation.
- **Progressive fulfillment / progressive revelation** - promises unfold historically, partially realized in Christ and the church, consummated eschatologically.
- **Covenant(s) (Abrahamic / Davidic / New Covenant)** - promises remain in force; their consummation is Christ-centered but maintains future particularity for Israel.
- **Continuity and discontinuity** - key hermeneutical pair: unity of God's plan with real distinctions in roles and promises.
- **Supersessionism (replacement theology)** - rejected; Blaising argues against nullifying Israel's future.
- **Classical dispensationalism** - also corrected: Blaising rejects an absolute church/Israel divide.
- **Already / not-yet** - used to explain present participation and future consummation of Israel's promises.
- **Typology / canonical reading** - method: read Paul in light of his use of the Old Testament within canon.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 9-11 with canonical and redemptive-historical sensitivity.
 - As a **polemic** against both supersessionism and rigid dispensational separation-serves as a balanced middle position.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and eschatology debates, supplying vocabulary and methodological guardrails for continuity/discontinuity discussions.
