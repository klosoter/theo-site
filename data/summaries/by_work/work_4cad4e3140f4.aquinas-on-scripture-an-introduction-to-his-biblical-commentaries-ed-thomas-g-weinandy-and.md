### TITLE
Aquinas on Scripture: An Introduction to his Biblical Commentaries (ed. Thomas G. Weinandy & Daniel A. Keating) 
Author: **Thomas Aquinas** (commentaries); editors: Weinandy & Keating

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Thirteenth-century Scholasticism; high medieval exegesis anchored in the **University of Paris** milieu and Dominican teaching. The modern edition situates Aquinas within patristic tradition and scholastic method.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas sees Scripture as a divinely inspired, unified witness to Christ; proper exegesis must harmonize the **literal sense** with the **spiritual senses** so that interpretation serves dogma, sacrament, and moral formation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: careful lexical and grammatical attention to the text, followed by doctrinal and spiritual amplification.
 - Distinguishes senses: literal and threefold spiritual (allegorical, tropological/moral, anagogical).
 - Uses typology: Old Testament persons/events as prefigurations of Christ and sacraments.
 - Employs Scholastic tools: distinctions, causality, correlatives (grace, nature, sacrament).
 - Practical aim: reading that yields orthodoxy (creedal harmony), liturgical use, and pastoral edification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy reliance on **Augustine**, Jerome, Gregory; engages Peter Lombard, classical philosophical authorities (notably Aristotle) and contemporary exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture-Authority; Christology (Christ as interpretive key); typology and covenantal continuity; sacraments as sacramental signs and cause of grace; moral theology arising from Scripture.
 - Explicit attention to the **New Covenant** as fulfilled in Christ and present in sacramental life (see Covenant Of Grace).
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas's biblical commentaries place **Christic, ecclesial, and sacramental unity** at the center of Scripture's meaning: literal fidelity disciplined by spiritual senses to serve the Church's faith and worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic integration of **literal exegesis and spiritual senses** with philosophical precision; not fanciful allegory but hierarchical senses ordered to doctrinal truth.
 - Sacramental reading: typology functions sacramentally-Old Testament rites and figures are real anticipations fulfilled in the sacraments.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - More disciplined than earlier allegorical excesses (e.g., some Origenist tendencies); more sacramentally centered than later Protestant literalist or forensic readings.
 - Unlike later Reformed formulations that articulate a juridical **Covenant of Grace** as primary schema, Aquinas subsumes covenant language within sacramental and participatory frameworks rather than a forensic legal structure.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear operationalization of the threefold spiritual sense as theological method; refined use of typology as a causal, not merely illustrative, relationship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in medieval and Roman Catholic exegesis and theology; recovered and edited by modern scholars (Weinandy & Keating) for contemporary retrieval.
 - Reformed and confessional traditions engage Aquinas selectively: useful for historical exegesis and sacramental theology but critiqued where his sacramental ontology contrasts with confessional covenantal legal categories (see Confessional Formulations Of Covenant).
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a mature model for harmonizing historical-critical attention with theological interpretation; valuable for ecumenical dialogue on Scripture, covenant, and sacraments.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Literal sense** - the proximate, historical-grammatical meaning; foundation for all further senses.
- **Allegorical sense** - Christological reading that shows how persons/events signify Christ and his mysteries.
- **Tropological (moral) sense** - ethical application for individual and ecclesial life.
- **Anagogical sense** - eschatological meaning oriented toward final consummation.
- **Typology** - causal anticipation: Old Testament realities effectually prefigure New Covenant realities and sacraments.
- **New Covenant / covenantal language** - Aquinas treats Christ as fulfillment of covenantal promises, realized sacramentally (relevant to Covenant Of Grace debates but not identical to Reformed forensic schema).
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)** - doctrinal coherence rule: Scripture interpreted in unity with Church doctrine and creeds.
- **Sensus fidelium** - the faith of the Church as interpretive safeguard and authoritative context.
- **Sacrament as sign and cause** - sacraments both signify and effect the grace they signify; biblical exegesis supports this reading.
- **Verbum internum/externe (word interior/exterior)** - distinction between Scripture as written word and the living Word (Christ) whom Scripture signifies.
- **Patristic reception** - Aquinas's exegesis rooted in Augustinian hermeneutic with Scholastic refinement.
- **Authority of Church tradition** - exegesis entrusted to the Church's teaching office; individual readings subordinate to ecclesial judgment.
- **Typological covenant continuity** - continuity between covenants through Christ; useful corrective to strictly discontinuous readings in later confessional debates (see Confessional Formulations Of Covenant).
- **Hermeneutical priority of Christ** - Christ as the key to Scripture; all senses converge on him.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for harmonizing literal-historical reading with theological (Christocentric) interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology and in discussions of covenant continuity (dialogue partner for Covenant Of Grace formulations).
 - As a **historical-definition source** for medieval hermeneutics and a polemical foil in confessional disputes over covenantal categories (Confessional Formulations Of Covenant).
