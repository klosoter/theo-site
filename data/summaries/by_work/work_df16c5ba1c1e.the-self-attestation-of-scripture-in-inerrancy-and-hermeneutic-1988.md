### TITLE
The Self-Attestation of Scripture - Gregory K. Beale (essay in Inerrancy and Hermeneutic, 1988)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical debate over biblical authority and hermeneutics, post-Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978).
 - Situated within conservative/Reformed responses to modern critical epistemologies and historical-critical challenges to inspiration and authority.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is self-attesting: its own internal witness (especially the testimony of the Spirit through the Word) is a proper and primary ground for its authority and truth.
 - Addresses whether appeal to Scripture's self-testimony is circular, epistemically vicious, or defensible as theologically and epistemologically coherent.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines what self-attestation/self-authentication entails: Scripture claims authority and truth; the Holy Spirit confirms that claim to believers in a nonmerely subjective but knowable way.
 - Distinguishes legitimate theological circularity (a closed, reflexive epistemic stance appropriate to revealed religion) from vicious epistemic circularity (arbitrary or question-begging).
 - Argues that any foundational epistemology for religion will end in a first principle; for Christian belief that principle properly is the divine self-revelation, apprehended through Scripture and Spirit.
 - Demonstrates that external evidences (historical, archaeological, philosophical) can support but not ultimately ground saving confidence in Scripture; they presuppose some prior trust in biblical categories and revelation.
 - Offers pastoral and hermeneutical implications: reading and interpreting Scripture presumes openness to its internal claim and to Spirit-led assent.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit interlocutors include higher-critical and empiricist approaches that demand external, neutral criteria for biblical truth.
 - Resonances with Reformed apologists and epistemologists (e.g., presuppositional concerns similar to Cornelius Van Til) and with classical defenses of inspiration (e.g., Warfieldian inerrancy), though Beale frames the argument with hermeneutical nuance.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, illumination, authority, hermeneutics, and epistemology of faith.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The conviction that Scripture, through its own witness and the Spirit's confirming work, provides a proper and non-arbitrary epistemic foundation for Christian doctrine and practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Tight integration of inerrancy doctrine with hermeneutical and epistemological considerations rather than treating them as separate dogmatic points.
 - Careful delineation of types of circularity, allowing a theologically warranted circularity for revealed religion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against demands that Scripture be validated exclusively by external, "neutral" standards; resists the notion that such standards are themselves neutral.
 - Clarifies and refines presuppositional insights without reducing to crude fideism or mere subjectivism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "self-attestation" in a way that aims to be both doctrinally robust and hermeneutically responsible: not a blind assertion but a witnessed, Spirit-confirmed claim.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable in evangelical and Reformed circles as a concise, philosophically and theologically aware defense of Scripture's internal warrant.
 - Cited in subsequent debates over the nature of biblical authority, particularly where theological epistemology and hermeneutics intersect.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear template for integrating doctrine of Scripture with interpretive practice; useful for seminarians and pastors wrestling with justification for trust in the Bible.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Self-attestation / Self-authentication**
 - The claim that Scripture bears witness to its own truth and authority; confirmed by the Spirit to believers.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Scripture as free from error in its autographs; invoked as a corollary to self-attestation.
- **Illumination**
 - The Spirit's work enabling assent to Scripture's claims; the experiential correlate to self-attestation.
- **Internal testimony**
 - The internal indicators within Scripture (claims, coherence, Christocentric fulfillment) that testify to its trustworthiness.
- **External evidence**
 - Historical, archaeological, and philosophical supports that may corroborate but do not ultimately ground saving confidence.
- **Circularity (legitimate vs. vicious)**
 - Legitimate: theological epistemic closure grounded in divine revelation; Vicious: arbitrary or question-begging epistemic move.
- **Presuppositionalism (analogous posture)**
 - The recognition that all knowledge requires starting assumptions; Beale aligns with the idea that Christian revelation can serve that starting point without irrationality.
- **Hermeneutic of faith**
 - Reading Scripture presuming its communicative and revelatory character, tempered by sound exegesis.
- **Authority**
 - Normative weight that Scripture exerts over belief and practice, grounded in its self-attestation and divine origin.
- **Normative use**
 - How Scripture functions in doctrine formation and ecclesial life when its self-attestation is affirmed.
- **Propositional revelation**
 - The formulation that Scripture communicates propositional truths which can be rightly assented to by believers.
- **Epistemic warrant**
 - The justification for belief in Scripture's truth: primarily internal (Spirit-witness plus Scripture's claims), secondarily supported by external evidence.
- **Canonical approach**
 - Attention to the Bible's unified witness and internal coherence as part of its self-attestation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the self-attestation position in doctrines of inspiration and inerrancy.
- As a **polemic** against epistemic demands that require external, supposedly neutral validation of Scripture.
- As an **exegetical-hermeneutical model** linking doctrine of Scripture with reading practices that presuppose Spirit-enabled assent.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching on theological epistemology: demonstrating a non-fideistic way to defend revealed authority.
