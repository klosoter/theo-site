### TITLE
**John Bolt, "Bavinck on the Order of Salvation: An Essay on Reformed Soteriology"** 
Secondary study of **Herman Bavinck**; situated in contemporary Reformed scholarship recovering Bavinck's dogmatics and his treatment of historia salutis vs ordo salutis.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed theological renewal; renewed anglophone interest in Bavinck as a corrective to both pietistic psychologizing of soteriology and abstract systematic ordering detached from biblical-historical narrative. 
 - Bolt writes as a Dutch-Reformed trained theologian working in North American academic contexts, bringing close reading of Bavinck's Gereformeerde Dogmatiek to anglophone audiences.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Bolt argues that Bavinck rejects a narrowly procedural, linear ordo salutis in favor of a **covenantal-historical (historia salutis) account** that preserves the real order of redemptive acts in the economy of the Triune God while integrating objective and subjective dimensions of salvation. Bavinck thus reframes "order" in service of redemption's unity rather than as a checklist of individual experiences.

- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Exposition of Bavinck's texts on calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, and perseverance. 
 - Diagnostic: contrasts pietistic/experiential ordo models and abstract schematic ordo lists with Bavinck's narrative-covenantal account. 
 - Constructive reading: shows how Bavinck locates the sequence in God's saving acts (incarnation, atonement, Spirit-bestowed union) rather than in mere chronology of application. 
 - Theological implications: maintains forensic justification and covenantal promise while insisting on the Spirit's personal agency and the believer's union with Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary: Herman Bavinck (esp. Reformed Dogmatics). 
 - Interlocutors & contrasts: classical Reformed formulations of ordo salutis (Calvin, later Reformed scholastics), pietistic emphases, and twentieth-century treatments (e.g., Barthian emphases on Christocentric primacy, and various Dutch Reformed voices). Bolt also interacts with modern Anglo-Reformed interpreters.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation (historical and covenantal), Covenant theology (covenant of redemption / covenant of grace), Trinity (economic distinctions), Christology (mediatorial work), Pneumatology (regeneration and union), soteriological loci: calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, perseverance, application of redemption.

- **Closing line:** 
 - Bolt presents Bavinck as restoring a **unified, Trinitarian, covenantal account of salvation** in which the "order" reflects God's saving acts in history rather than a fragmented sequence of subjective experiences.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Prioritizes **historia salutis** (saving history) over merely schematic ordo lists; treats the ordo as embedded in covenant acts and Trinitarian economy. 
 - Stresses the **objective reality** of redemption (Christ's accomplished work) together with the Spirit's personal application - avoiding reduction to either pole.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects pietistic and psychological reductions that temporalize soteriological categories into individual experiential steps. 
 - Pushes back on overly atomizing ordo schemes that sever theological loci from redemptive narrative and covenantal promise.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Recasts "order" as an **ecclesial-historical ordering** (how God acts in history and through covenant structures) rather than a mere sequence of inner experiences. 
 - Distinguishes carefully between objective benefits in Christ and their subjective appropriation without collapsing them.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Bolt's essay has aided anglophone reception of Bavinck, informing seminary teaching and contemporary Reformed debates on ordo vs historia. 
 - Influential among those seeking a balanced, confessional Reformed soteriology that avoids schematic reductionism.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a model for combining close historical-theological exegesis with constructive dogmatic work; valuable for courses on soteriology, covenant theology, and systematic methodology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Historia salutis** - the narrative/historical unfolding of God's saving acts; Bavinck/Bolt prioritize this as normative for ordering soteriological loci. 
- **Ordo salutis** - traditional list of salvation's logical or experiential order; reinterpreted as embedded in historia rather than a temporal checklist. 
- **Objective redemption** - Christ's accomplished work (atonement, vindication) as real benefits independent of immediate subjective appropriation. 
- **Subjective application** - Spirit-wrought appropriation (calling, regeneration, faith) that actualizes objective benefits. 
- **Union with Christ** - pivotal relational category that unites objective and subjective sides; primary principle for order and application. 
- **Effectual calling** - the Spirit's sovereign call that results in new life; located within covenantal-historical action. 
- **Regeneration / New birth** - personal, Spirit-producing renewal; not merely a psychological change but entrance into covenantal life. 
- **Justification (forensic)** - declarative acquittal grounded in Christ's work, retained in Bavinck's account and linked to covenant promise. 
- **Sanctification** - both positional and progressive; integrated with justification and perseverance in the life of union. 
- **Covenant of Redemption / Covenant of Grace** - relational frameworks that structure God's plan and the application of redemption. 
- **Trinitarian economy** - ordering of redemptive acts according to the roles of Father, Son, and Spirit; theological lens for "order." 
- **Application of redemption** - umbrella term for how objective benefits are applied to believers (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification). 
- **Federal headship / representation** - ground for imputation themes (Christ as federal head for elect).

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for a covenantal, historia-based understanding of ordo salutis. 
 - As a **polemic** against schematic or purely experiential orderings of salvation. 
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading systematic loci through redemptive-historical and Trinitarian lenses. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary curricula to integrate doctrinal loci around union with Christ.
