### TITLE
**The Two Natures in Christ** - B. B. Warfield (essay in Biblical and Theological Studies; early 20th‑century Princeton/Reformed context)

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th‑century Princeton theology: conservative Reformed response to modernist and speculative revisions of Christology.
 - Written as part of Warfield's systematic and apologetic work defending classical Christology against modern reinterpretations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the Chalcedonian formula that in Christ there are two complete natures (divine and human) personally united in the one person (hypostasis) of the Son, without confusion, change, division, or separation.
 - To oppose theories (esp. modern kenotic reconstructions) that compromise either the fullness of the divine nature or the integrity of the human nature.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening: reads pertinent New Testament texts (e.g., Phil 2:6-8; Heb 4:15; John) to establish biblical data about both fullness of deity and true humanity.
 - Doctrinal framing: appeals to Chalcedon and patristic categories (nature, person, properties) to provide conceptual precision.
 - Systematic moves:
 - Defends the **real distinction of natures**: each nature retains its properties; the person is the single subject who has both sets of properties.
 - Analyzes and rejects **kenotic reconstructions** that claim the Son emptied or divested divine attributes in the incarnation (see Kenosis Theories And Critiques).
 - Reaffirms **communicatio idiomatum** narrowly: properties are ascribed to the person by virtue of the union, not by transfer between natures (see Communicatio Idiomatum topic).
 - Treats Christ's moral perfection: argues for the **impeccability** of Christ - true human susceptibility to temptation but no personal sin (see Impeccability Of Christ).
 - Concludes by insisting that Chalcedonian Christology alone preserves Scripture, the atonement, and orthodox Trinitarian theology.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Patristic authorities (implicitly Chalcedon, Cyril, Leo), Reformation expositors, contemporaneous kenotic proponents and theological modernists.
 - Engages biblical texts and classical dogmatic categories rather than speculative metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation, person and natures), soteriology (atonement presuppositions), doctrine of God (attributes and immutability), Scripture and revelation to the extent they bear on Christological confession.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's central gravity: the hypostatic union must preserve both full deity and full humanity without category collapse - any theory that compromises either undermines redemption and orthodox worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Precision in distinguishing **nature** (what a thing is) from **person** (who subsists), with careful limits on communicatio idiomatum.
 - Strong insistence that divine attributes are not literally transferred to the human nature nor abolished in the personhood of the Logos.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Polemic against 19th‑century and contemporary **kenotic** proposals that read Phil 2 as metaphysical self‑emptying of divine attributes.
 - Reclaims Chalcedon against both **Eutychian** fusion and **Nestorian** division: unity of person without mixture of natures.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much neologisms as methodological clarity: careful operational definitions of "communication" and an emphasis on ascription to the person rather than ontological transfer.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in Reformed and conservative Anglican circles as a rigorous defense of classical Christology.
 - Influential in 20th‑century defenses of Chalcedon and in rebuttals to modern kenotic proposals; continues to be cited in theological treatments of communicatio idiomatum and Christ's impeccability.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies disciplined use of Scripture, patristic formulations, and analytic precision; valuable for teaching orthodox Christology and for polemics against revisionist accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - One person (hypostasis) with two distinct natures, divine and human.
- **Nature (physis)** - The essential set of properties; Warfield insists on the integrity of each nature in Christ.
- **Person (hypostasis / persona)** - The subsisting subject who bears both natures; the Son of God is the personal subject.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - Attribution of properties to the person of Christ; Warfield limits this to ascription, not ontological transfer.
 - Distinguishes: *ascription to the person* vs *transfer between natures*.
- **Kenosis / Kenotic Theory** - The idea that the Son 'emptied' himself by divesting divine attributes in the incarnation; Warfield critiques this as philosophically and theologically defective.
- **Impeccability of Christ** - Doctrine that Christ, though truly tempted, could not sin; Warfield defends moral impeccability grounded in the union and divine personhood.
- **Properties (proprietates)** - Characteristics properly belonging to a nature; central in Warfield's analysis to prevent conflation.
- **Chalcedonian Formula** - "One person in two natures" held as the normative standard Warfield defends.
- **Real Distinction** - The natures are genuinely distinct though united; avoids fusion or separation.
- **Attribution (adscriptio)** - How predicates are applied to Christ in Scripture - key hermeneutical move in Warfield's method.
- **Passibility / Impassibility** - Related to whether divine nature can suffer; Warfield navigates so that the person suffers in his human nature without divine impassibility being compromised.
- **Incarnation (Enfleshment)** - The taking on of human nature by the Logos without loss of divinity.
- **Personhood and Agency** - Christ's actions are personal; Warfield emphasizes the Son's singular agency.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definitional source** for defending Chalcedonian categories in Reformed theology.
 - As a **polemic** text against kenotic and other modern reductions of the deity or humanity of Christ.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading texts like Phil 2 and Hebrews 4:15 through classical dogmatic lenses.
