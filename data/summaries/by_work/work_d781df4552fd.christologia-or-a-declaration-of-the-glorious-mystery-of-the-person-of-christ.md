### TITLE
**Christologia, or A Declaration of the Glorious Mystery of the Person of Christ** - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritan milieu; Owen writing within the Reformed scholastic and pastoral tradition in the wake of the English Civil Wars, Interregnum and early Restoration controversies.
 - Responds to post-Reformation challenges: Socinian denials of Christ's pre-existence/divinity, Arminian emphases, and any contemporary drift toward a "peccable" view of the human Christ.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To vindicate the orthodox, Chalcedonian doctrine of the person of Christ: the eternal Son is truly God and truly man in a hypostatic union, whose incarnation, mediation, and sinless life are necessary to salvation.
 - Treats especially the relation of the divine and human wills, the **eternal Sonship and the Incarnation**, and the question of Christ's **impeccability** (ability vs. inability to sin).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Christ's person: eternal pre-existence, divine generation, and personal identity of the Son.
 - Defense of the Incarnation: real assumption of a complete human nature (body and soul) without confusion of natures.
 - Analysis of the union: how properties of each nature abide in the one person (communication of idioms) while preserving distinction.
 - Moral and soteriological consequences: Christ's sinlessness, the necessity of impeccability for atoning efficacy, and the reality of temptation without culpable failure.
 - Practical and pastoral conclusion: devotion to Christ as mediator, vindicating worship and trust in his saving work.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture and the Church Fathers (Athanasius, Cyril) as primary authorities.
 - Reformed confessions and scholastic formulations; explicit polemics against Socinians and Arminians.
 - Engagement with contemporary theological language about will, nature, and person.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (eternal relations, generation), Christology (hypostatic union, natures and person), Incarnation, sinlessness/impeccability, temptations, mediation, obedience (active and passive), aspects of soteriology and covenantal fulfillment.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The person of Christ - eternally the Son, truly God and truly man in one person - is the indispensable pivot for salvation; his real, sinless humanity united to the divine Son secures our redemption and warrants worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic insistence that **eternal Sonship** is ontological (a relation in the Godhead) not merely economic; the Son's personhood precedes and grounds the Incarnation.
 - Nuanced defense of **impeccability**: Christ was genuinely tempted but, by virtue of the hypostatic union and divine decree, could not sin in a way that would vitiate his mediatorial work.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Strong corrective to Socinianism (denial of pre-existence/divinity) and to any view that treats Christ as a mere exemplary man.
 - Rebuffs both a crude kenotic reading that empties the divine nature and any account that dissolves genuine human freedom in Christ into determinism.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise distinctions between *ability* and *inability* to sin in the incarnate Son; careful vocabulary on temptation vs. sin.
 - Clear handling of communicatio idiomatum that protects both personal unity and ontological distinction of natures.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in later Reformed and Puritan Christology; frequently cited in debates about sinlessness and the eternal Sonship.
 - Used by subsequent systematicians as a model for marrying scholastic precision with pastoral ends.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies rigorous, pastoral Reformed Christology: tight exegetical-theological argumentation with applicability to worship, assurance, and polemical defense.
 - Valuable for teaching the interrelation of Trinitarian theology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - One person (the Son) subsisting in two distinct natures, without confusion or change.
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's personal relation within the Trinity that precedes the Incarnation; not a mode of the economic mission.
 - Used as a doctrinal buffer against views that reduce Sonship to an office or temporal role.
- **Incarnation** - The Son's assumption of a true human nature (body and rational soul) into personal union.
- **Impeccability** - The doctrine that Christ, in his person, did not and could not commit sin; Owen distinguishes real temptation from culpable sin.
 - Applied polemically against positions that either deny Christ's sinlessness or make his sinlessness a mere possibility.
- **Peccability** - The contrary thesis (that Christ could have sinned); Owen refutes or re-frames this in terms of real freedom compatible with non-fallibility.
- **Communication of Idioms (communicatio idiomatum)** - How attributes of each nature are ascribed to the one person without ontological transfer.
- **Temptation** - Real assaults on Christ's human will; Owen insists these were genuine but non-conclusive.
- **Kenosis** - Discussed negatively insofar as some readings imply an emptying that compromises divine attributes; Owen safeguards divine immutability.
- **Active and Passive Obedience** - Christ's life obedience and suffering counted for believers; Owen ties these to the person who is both God and man.
- **Mediatorship** - The Son's role as one who reconciles and represents; rooted in real humanity and eternal Sonship.
- **Divine Necessity vs. Free Will** - Owen clarifies that Christ's non-fallibility is consistent with real will and morally significant agency.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed treatments of Eternal Sonship and Incarnation.
 - As a **polemic and resource** in debates over the Impeccability of Christ (used by those affirming sinlessness and by critics to engage Owen's fine distinctions).
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Christological texts in Scripture through a covenantal and Trinitarian lens.
