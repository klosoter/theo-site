### TITLE
Redemption and Resurrection - Richard B. Gaffin Jr., in Resurrection and Eschatology: Theology in Service of the Church (essay)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed conversation recovering the centrality of bodily resurrection against both liberal demythologizing and purely "spiritual" readings of eschatology.
 - Engages renewed biblical-theological method within confessional Reformed theology; addresses pastoral and sacramental ramifications (e.g., baptism).
- **Central thesis**
 - **The bodily resurrection of Christ is the decisive, historical inaugurating act of redemption;** it is not an optional addendum to justification but the ontological guarantee and pole of the redeemed new creation that grounds Christian hope, union with Christ, and sacramental participation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical base in Pauline corpus (notably 1 Corinthians 15, Romans 4-8, Philippians) that connects Christ's resurrection to believers' justification, sanctification, and future bodily resurrection.
 - The resurrection is treated as the eschatological realization and assurance of covenantal promises - a firstfruits event that secures the full-bodied renewal of creation.
 - Theological implication: ecclesial rites (baptism) and soteriological categories (union with Christ, justification) must be read through this resurrectional lens.
 - Methodological claim: biblical theology (careful exegesis of canonical testimony) must inform systematic formulations; Scripture's self-witness to the resurrection is authoritative for doctrine.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Pauline texts; secondary engagement with Reformed confessions and recent theological proposals that downplay bodily resurrection or separate justification from resurrectional reality.
 - Dialogue with modern exegetical trends that either spiritualize or privatize resurrectional language.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, eschatological redemption), Christology (resurrection as vindication and lordship), eschatology (already/not-yet, new creation), covenant theology (covenant promises and sacramental sign-acts), ecclesiology & sacraments (baptism), bibliology (authority of Scripture as witness to resurrection).
- **Closing line**
 - The resurrection is the theological axial point: the historical, bodily resurrection of Christ secures covenantal redemption and reorients sacramental practice and systematic theology toward a renewed, incarnational new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Emphasis on resurrection as constitutive of redemption**
 - Not merely proof-text support but the ontological ground of believers' new life and future bodily resurrection.
- **Integration of biblical theology and confessional Reformed commitments**
 - Moves from exegetical anchors in Paul into systematic conclusions consistent with covenantal categories.
- **Corrective to two errors**
 - Against liberal demythologizing that evacuates historicity and bodilyity from resurrection claims.
 - Against purely "spiritualized" or privatized eschatologies that ignore the creational and communal dimensions of resurrection.
- **Sacramental and covenantal ramifications**
 - Reshapes understanding of baptism as participation in Christ's death and resurrection - supports a covenantal logic that can bear on infant baptism debates regarding efficacy and inclusion.
- **Methodological posture**
 - Affirms Scripture's self-attestation and its decisive role in framing doctrinal claims about resurrection and redemption; insists that theological method must remain accountable to canonical testimony.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a robust defense of bodily resurrection tied to covenantal soteriology.
 - Used as a corrective in debates over eschatology, sacramental theology, and biblical-theological method.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear exegetical linkage of Pauline witness to systematic commitments; pedagogically useful for instructing on how resurrection shapes doctrine, piety, and sacramental life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (bodily)** - Historical, corporeal rising of Christ; the decisive token and guarantee of believers' future bodily life.
- **Redemption** - Covenantally framed liberation and renewal of persons and creation effected by Christ and grounded in his resurrection.
- **Union with Christ** - Theoretical pivot linking justification, sanctification, and future resurrection; believers participate in Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Firstfruits** - Christ's resurrection as inaugural; guarantees the eschatological harvest (full resurrection of the redeemed).
- **Already / Not Yet** - Eschatological tension: resurrection is inaugurated in Christ and experienced sacramentally; consummation awaits the new creation.
- **Baptism (participation)** - Sacramental sign and means of communicating union with Christ; baptism participates in death/resurrection realities and has covenantal implications (used in infant/paedobaptism discussions).
- **Covenant of Grace** - Framework for situating resurrection within promised consummation and corporate covenantal identity.
- **Covenant of Works** - Background juridical frame; Gaffin's focus places resurrection as vindicating covenantal promises without collapsing covenants.
- **Scriptural self-attestation** - Claim that Scripture authoritatively bears witness to resurrectional facts and shapes doctrine; resists external criteria that nullify biblical testimony.
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology** - Work illustrates a model in which careful canonical exegesis constrains and informs systematic construction.
- **New Creation** - Resurrection confirms continuity of creation (restored and renewed) rather than negating the material order.
- **Justification & Eschatology** - Justification receives its eschatological assurance in the resurrection; forensic and eschatological dimensions are interlinked.
- **Principia (theological method as disciplined science)** - Exemplifies disciplined, confessional theological method: exegesis-driven, doctrinally responsible, and ecclesially oriented.

How this work is used across loci
- As a definitional source tying **resurrection** to the concept of covenantal **redemption**.
- As a polemic against theological moves that detach soteriology from bodily eschatology.
- As an exegetical-model for reading **Pauline texts** (1 Cor 15; Rom 6-8) in constructive doctrine.
- As a conceptual pivot linking **sacramental theology (baptism)** to eschatological hope and covenantal inclusion.
