### TITLE
Ancient Texts for New Testament Studies: A Guide to the Background Literature - Craig A. Evans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical-critical NT scholarship. Evans compiles and orients students to primary non-canonical and canonical background corpora (Septuagint, Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Greco-Roman sources) that illuminate New Testament language and concepts.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Not a singular doctrinal thesis on Christology; rather, a methodological claim: reliable interpretation of New Testament claims about **Messiah**, **kingdom**, and Jesus' self-understanding requires sustained engagement with the relevant ancient texts and genres that formed the intellectual and religious horizon of Jesus and early Christians.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Systematic survey of corpora useful for NT studies (Hebrew Bible / LXX, Apocrypha, Pseudepigrapha, Qumran, Hellenistic Judaism, Greco-Roman writings).
 - Thematic cross-references that link background texts to specific NT motifs (e.g., Son of Man, Danielic kingship, royal psalms, temple/kingdom language).
 - Annotated bibliographies and brief textual orientations that point scholars to primary sources and key secondary literature for particular theological problems.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary ancient authors and corpora: Psalms, Daniel, 1-2 Enoch, Jubilees, Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Josephus, Rabbinic fragments, Greco-Roman historians and political rhetoric.
 - Modern interlocutors implied or cited: major historians and NT scholars who debate Jesus' messianic awareness and kingdom-talk (Evans frames these debates by directing to primary texts rather than offering a new monograph-level reconstruction).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (messianic titles and function), **Kingdom of God** (basileia/teaching), revelation (scriptural intertextuality), covenant themes, ecclesiology (implied in messianic-community relations), eschatology/apocalyptic expectation.
- **Closing line:** Evans furnishes a disciplined, text-centered toolkit showing that Jesus' messianic consciousness and kingdom language must be read within a plurality of Jewish and Greco-Roman textual horizons rather than through later doctrinal categories alone.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Primary-text primacy: Evans privileges acquaintance with the ancient texts themselves over reliance on modern syntheses.
 - Genre sensitivity: emphasizes how different genres (apocalypse, psalm, wisdom, legal text) shape messianic and kingdom language.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves against ahistorical or anachronistic readings that read post-apostolic christological formulas back into Jesus' ministry.
 - Corrects oversimplified "one-line" portrayals of Jewish expectation by demonstrating textual plurality and nuance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Less about new technical vocabulary than about reframing methodological priorities: **background literacy** as a hermeneutical virtue for NT theology.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely used as a reference and teaching aid in seminaries across traditions; appreciated in Reformed contexts for careful textual grounding of doctrines like covenantal messianism and kingdom ethics.
 - Adopted by historians and exegetes as a practical entry point to source materials that inform debates on Jesus' messianic self-understanding.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Compact orientation to a large body of primary literature; durable as a bibliographic and pedagogical tool for courses on Christology, kingdom, and Second Temple contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Second Temple Judaism:** The broad religious matrix (sectarian diversity) from which messianic expectations arose.
- **Septuagint (LXX):** Greek OT text often used by NT authors; crucial for verbal echoes and messianic citation patterns.
- **Pseudepigrapha (e.g., 1 Enoch):** Sources that shape "Son of Man" and heavenly-figure images relevant to Jesus' self-designation.
- **Dead Sea Scrolls (Qumran):** Community texts showing variant messianic and royal expectations, priestly-king models, and apocalyptic chronology.
- **Daniel 7 / Son of Man:** Key apocalyptic royal motif that undergirds NT usage of the phrase and messianic authority.
- **Royal Psalms / Psalm 2:** Royal ideology that informs Jewish expectations of a God-anointed king and NT messianic claims.
- **Basileia / Kingdom of God:** Socio-political and theological term whose range Evans shows through Jewish and Greco-Roman parallels.
- **Kyrios / Lord:** Title transition from OT deity-language to messianic application in early Christology.
- **Temple symbolism:** Interplay of kingship, priesthood, and temple imagery in messianic conceptions.
- **Exousia / Authority:** Roman/political and Jewish-religious senses that color NT claims about Jesus' authority.
- **Apocalyptic vs. Wisdom frameworks:** Contrasts in expectation-shaping genres that affect how kingdom and messiah are represented.
- **Sectarian expectations (Pharisees / Essenes):** Localized expectations that affect reception and interpretation of messianic claim.
- **Intertextuality:** The practice by which NT authors echo and reshape earlier texts to articulate Jesus' messianic identity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source base**: quick reference for primary texts that define messianic and kingdom vocabulary.
- As an **exegetical model**: methodological check insisting that NT interpretation must cite and compare background corpora.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in polemical or constructive theology: supplies raw textual data to bolster historical reconstructions of Jesus' messianic consciousness.
