### TITLE
Revelation and Reason (1946) - Emil Brunner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar neo-orthodox theology; response to liberal natural theology and to Karl Barth's critique. Written amid mid-20th-century debates about the intelligibility of God and the credibility of Scripture.
 - Brunner aims to mediate between modern philosophical challenges and confessional Christian claims, within a Reformed/Swiss theological milieu.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The central claim: **revelation is God's decisive self-disclosure in Christ, but revelation does not stand opposed to reason**; rather, God has given general (natural) revelation that makes human persons receptive to special revelation, though sin distorts that capacity.
 - Core problem addressed: how to hold the priority and uniqueness of special revelation while affirming a genuine, though limited, validity to natural theology and human reason.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern faith crisis stems partly from misunderstanding the relation of reason and revelation.
 - Positive claim:
 - God discloses himself **in creation and conscience** (general revelation) and decisively in **Christ and Scripture** (special revelation).
 - General revelation provides **preparatory conditions** for encountering special revelation; it is not salvific in itself.
 - Limiting claim:
 - Human reason is **noetically affected by sin**, so natural knowledge of God is partial and susceptible to idolatry.
 - Conclusion: Authentic apologetics and theology must begin with the reality of revelation while respecting the mediated, analogical character of created knowledge.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal interlocutor: **Karl Barth** (argumentative exchange about natural theology).
 - Engages classical scholastic categories (analogy), patristic and Reformation sources, modern philosophy (epistemology), and contemporary theological liberalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general vs special), **bibliology** (role/authority of Scripture), **noetics** and **sin**, **Christology** (Christ as decisive revelation; implicit use of hypostatic union), **soteriology** (preparatory/common grace), and implications for apologetics.

- **Closing line**
 - Brunner stakes a mediating position: **Christ is the unique Word of God, yet God's prior self-disclosure in creation and conscience provides a genuine, albeit impaired, rational point of contact for the Gospel.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong affirmation of **both** the reality of general revelation and its **dependence** on special revelation for saving knowledge.
 - Emphasizes **accommodation**: God condescends to human modes of knowing; revelation is personal encounter not merely propositional data.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal overconfidence in unaided reason and Schleiermacher-style religion as feeling; opposes Barth's near-total rejection of natural theology.
 - Seeks a middle path: neither autonomous reason nor revelation severed from human cognition.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear articulation of **"preparatory grace"** (a form of common grace making human faculties receptive).
 - Nuanced use of **analogy/accommodation** to defend legitimate, though analogical, knowledge of God from creation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in midcentury neo-orthodox and evangelical circles as a corrective to both liberalism and anti-natural-theology Barthianism.
 - Provoked ongoing debate with Barth; influenced later discussions on natural theology, apologetics, and the doctrine of revelation.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a serviceable framework for contemporary debates on faith and reason, particularly where one must navigate secular epistemologies without abandoning the uniqueness of Christ and Scripture.
 - Useful pedagogically to show how noetic effects of sin and common/preparatory grace shape theological epistemology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **General revelation (natural revelation)**
 - Knowledge of God through creation, conscience, human reason; genuine but non-salvific and impaired by sin.

- **Special revelation**
 - God's decisive self-disclosure in Christ and mediated in Scripture; normative for faith and salvation.

- **Preliminary / preparatory grace**
 - God's common work in creation and conscience that prepares humans to receive special revelation.

- **Common grace**
 - Broader divine benevolence restraining evil and enabling cultural/lawful knowledge; grounds for speaking positively about reason.

- **Accommodation**
 - The doctrine that God adapts divine self-disclosure to human capacity; key to Brunner's account of revelation as comprehensible without being identical to divine reality.

- **Analogy (analogy of being / analogical knowledge)**
 - Affirmed in qualified form: creaturely attributes analogically reflect Creator, allowing intelligible talk about God while avoiding identity.

- **Noetic effects of sin**
 - Sin's corrupting influence on human cognition; explains limitations and distortions in natural theology.

- **Revelation as event / personal encounter**
 - Revelation is not merely propositional information; it is an encounter with the living God, climaxing in the person of Christ.

- **Word of God (Christocentrism)**
 - Christ is the living Word and the decisive revelation; Scripture bears witness to that Word.

- **Scripture / bibliology**
 - Scripture is authoritative witness to revelation; must be read in Christ-centered manner.

- **Hypostatic union**
 - Used as the theological ground for Christ's uniqueness as God's definitive self-revelation to humanity (incarnation as decisive accommodation).

- **Union with Christ**
 - The epistemic and soteriological corollary: true knowledge of God occurs within the relational union effected by Christ.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for nuanced relations between natural and special revelation and for the term "preparatory grace."
 - As a **polemic** against both theological liberalism and Barthian denial of natural revelation-frequently cited in debates over natural theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in apologetics and doctrine of revelation when balancing epistemic humility with affirmations of reason.
 - Less often used as an exegetical manual; more influential as systematic/epistemological theology.
