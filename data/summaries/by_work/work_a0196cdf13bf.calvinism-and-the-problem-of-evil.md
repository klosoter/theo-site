### TITLE
Calvinism and the Problem of Evil - David Alexander & Daniel Johnson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed engagement with classical theodicy; dialogue between analytic philosophy of religion and confessional Calvinist theology.
 - Responds to late 20th-21st century challenges: evidential problem of evil (Rowe), logical problem (Mackie), and alternatives such as Molinism and Open Theism.
 - Addresses both academic apologetics and pastoral-theological concerns in Reformed churches.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvinist commitments to divine sovereignty, predestination, and meticulous providence can be reconciled with the reality of moral and natural evil when framed within a Christ-centered, redemptive theodicy that attends to both divine glory and creaturely responsibility.
 - The work defends a compatibilist account of human freedom and argues that reprobation and the permission of evil are intelligible within a Trinitarian, covenantal economy.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic stage: clarifies the categories of the problem of evil (logical vs evidential; moral vs natural) and summarizes contemporary critiques of classicalism.
 - Exegetical-theological stage: reads key biblical texts (Job, Romans 9, John 9, Genesis 3, Psalms) through a Reformed grid to show continuity between creation's fall, divine decrees, and redemptive purposes.
 - Philosophical-theological stage:
 - Articulates Calvinist compatibilist freedom and distinguishes it from libertarian freedom endorsed by Arminian/Molinist responses.
 - Advances a Reformed greater-good/greater-glory defense: certain evils are permitted as antecedents to goods that display attributes of God (justice, mercy, grace) and the redemptive accomplishment in Christ.
 - Treats natural evil as consequence of creaturely fall and as instrument in providential ordering toward eschatological restoration.
 - Pastoral-apologetic stage: offers application for preaching, pastoral care, and apologetics, emphasizing lament and trust rather than speculative theodicy.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Classical and Reformed: Augustine, John Calvin, Jonathan Edwards.
 - Contemporary: Alvin Plantinga (free will defense), J.L. Mackie, William Rowe, proponents of Molinism and Open Theism.
 - Philosophical resources on freedom, probability, and evidential reasoning.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine sovereignty, providence, predestination/reprobation, human freedom (compatibilism), original sin/total depravity, atonement (penal substitution emphasized), Christology (central to redemptive explanation), eschatology (final resolution).

- **Closing line**
 - Calvinism and the Problem of Evil advances a disciplined, Christ-centered Reformed theodicy: evil is permitted within God's sovereign, covenantal plan so that his justice and mercy converge in the redemption accomplished and consummated in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on **compatibilist freedom** as sufficient for moral responsibility; rejects libertarian alternatives as theologically and philosophically costly.
 - Integrates **penal substitution** and the cross as the hermeneutical key for understanding divine purposes in permitting evil.
 - Prioritizes **covenantal and Trinitarian categories** over merely metaphysical appeals to inscrutability.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Arminian/Molinist strategies that locate theodicy primarily in libertarian free will and middle knowledge; argues those routes undermine divine sovereignty or make God epistemically impotent.
 - Counters skeptical theism that relativizes moral reasoning by insisting on veridical theological claims about God's character revealed in Scripture.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Refines the phrase **"redemptive permission"** to denote evils permitted specifically as ordinated means within salvific economy.
 - Proposes **"servant-sovereignty"** as a term to balance God's absolute rule with his self-giving in the Trinity and on the cross.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed academic and pastoral circles; used as a standard pro-Reformed resource in apologetics courses.
 - Criticized by some philosophers for relying on theological commitments that non-Calvinists reject; prompts renewed debate on the limits of philosophical theodicy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary integration of biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and analytic clarity.
 - Valuable for pastors, teachers, and students seeking a coherent Reformed model that is both intellectually robust and pastorally sensitive.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's absolute rule; central explanans for permission and ordering of evil.
- **Providence** - God's governance; includes preservation, concurrence, and permissive will.
- **Compatibilism** - Freedom compatible with determinative divine decree; defended as the Reformed account of moral responsibility.
- **Redemptive permission** - Permitting evil as an instrument ordained toward redemptive ends.
- **Predestination / reprobation** - Divine election and non-election discussed as ethically and theologically significant for theodicy.
- **Greater-good / greater-glory theodicy** - Argument that permitted evils serve higher goods that manifest divine attributes.
- **Inscrutability (divine hiddenness)** - Addressed but bounded by christological revelation; not an excuse for epistemic resignation.
- **Moral evil vs natural evil** - Moral evil traced to creaturely agency; natural evil traced to creation's fall and providential ordering.
- **Penal substitution** - Atonement doctrine used to interpret God's justice and mercy in theodical terms.
- **Covenantal framework** - The interpretive lens for ordering events of fall, punishment, and redemption.
- **Joban lament / pastoral praxis** - Emphasizes lament as theological category for responding to evil.
- **Skeptical theism (critically engaged)** - Acknowledged but critiqued when it disables moral and theological reasoning.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Reformed compatibilist theodicy and the term "redemptive permission."
 - As a **polemic** against libertarian-theodicies (Molinism, Open Theism) and skeptical theism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 9, Job, and the cross theologically into theodical debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Reformed curricula linking soteriology and providence to practical pastoral responses to suffering.
