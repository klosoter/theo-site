### TITLE
**Against the Gods: The Polemical Theology of the Old Testament - John D. Currid**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical Old Testament scholarship; engages both historical-critical ANE studies and confessional theological reading.
 - Moves within the tradition of canonical and theological OT interpretation, aiming to show Israelite religion as intentionally anti-polytheistic.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Old Testament must be read as a sustained polemic: its primary theological project is to confront, delegitimize, and replace the gods of the surrounding ANE world by positing YHWH as sole sovereign Creator, King, and Redeemer.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Surveys language and motifs across Pentateuch, Psalms, Prophets, and Wisdom literature to demonstrate recurrent anti-god rhetoric.
 - Major moves:
 - Establishes the historical-religious context of Israel amid Canaanite, Mesopotamian, and Egyptian pantheons.
 - Shows how creation language, covenant forms, divine sovereignty, and cultic reform function polemically.
 - Argues that theological categories (monotheism, election, covenantal law) are framed as counters to foreign deities and their associated worldview.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interacts with ANE texts (Baal narratives, Ugaritic poetry), critical OT scholarship on monotheism/henotheism, and historical-theological interpreters.
 - Dialogues implicitly with scholars who see Israelite religion developing from henotheism to monotheism; engages archaeological and textual parallels to clarify polemic.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (God as Creator and creator-language as polemic against other gods).
 - **Divine sovereignty and kingship** (YHWH as cosmic ruler).
 - **Covenant theology** (suzerainty-covenant form as antithesis to foreign patronage systems).
 - **Idolatry and cult** (ritual critique and ethical implications).
 - **Revelation** (YHWH's acts as decisive revelation that disproves rival gods).
 - Less direct treatment of Trinity and Christology; Christological readings remain downstream implications rather than focal claims.
- **Closing line**
 - Currid's theological center of gravity: the Old Testament is primarily polemical rhetoric designed to dethrone rival gods and establish YHWH's exclusive claim as Creator, King, and Redeemer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats **polemic** itself as the hermeneutical lens - theological motifs are read as responses to specific ANE religious claims rather than isolated internal developments.
 - Emphasizes the rhetorical strategies of Scripture (mockery, challenge, demonstration by deed) in exposing false deities.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that minimize anti-polytheistic rhetoric or that reduce Israelite religion to a gradual, internal evolution toward monotheism. Argues for intentional, sustained antagonism from earliest strata.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Frames covenant and creation language as **contest discourse**: covenant not merely relational law but a polemical replacement for patron-client deity relationships in ANE cultures.
 - Emphasizes **creation-as-polemical-proof** - creation acts as empirical/theological refutation of rival gods' claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed OT courses as a corrective to purely historical-descriptive readings; cited in discussions on monotheism and Israelite identity.
 - Influential for preachers and teachers wanting a coherent theological rationale for OT polemics against idolatry.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how theological content in the OT functions in lived religious conflict; valuable for pastors, apologists, and scholars who need an integrated account of Israel's anti-idolatry rhetoric.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Polemic / polemical theology** - central hermeneutical category: Scripture's argumentative stance against other deities.
- **YHWH vs. the gods** - recurring contrast: YHWH as exclusive Creator/King, other gods shown impotent or false.
- **Creation (bara; toledot)** - used as theological evidence against polytheism; creation ex nihilo or by divine fiat demonstrates sole sovereignty.
- **Divine kingship / suzerainty covenant** - kingdom metaphors and covenant form recast to oppose ANE divine-patron models.
- **Idolatry (pesha / avodah zarah)** - not merely ritual error but theological betrayal; idol cults as alternative allegiances.
- **Monotheism vs. henotheism** - Currid reads early Israeline texts as intentionally monotheistic or at least polemically so, challenging views of gradual monotheism.
- **Covenant fidelity / election** - election framed as a polemical counter to tribal/mythic loyalties fostered by other cults.
- **Aniconism** - theological stance against images, argued to be part of the polemic strategy.
- **Creation ex nihilo / Creator God** - creation doctrine used as decisive evidence for YHWH's supremacy.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - anthropology grounded in Creator's uniqueness; used to contrast human role under YHWH vs. dependence on cultic patrons.
- **Cultic reform / prophetic critique** - prophetic denunciations as primary vehicles of polemic.
- **Baal, Asherah, and ANE deities** - primary foils in Currid's analyses.
- **Rhetorical strategies** - mockery, legal challenge, demonstration by act are highlighted as scriptural tactics.
- **Traducianism vs Creationism** - Currid does not primarily debate the origin-of-soul issue; his emphasis on divine creation and human status in the Creator's order makes the work usable for proponents of **creationist** accounts of the soul because it stresses direct divine agency in human origins and the ontological distinctiveness granted by God.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for what constitutes OT polemic and anti-idolatry theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** in apologetics against religious pluralism and ancient polytheism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading covenantal and creation texts as engaged in interreligious debate.
