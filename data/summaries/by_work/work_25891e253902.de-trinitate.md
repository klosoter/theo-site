### TITLE
De Trinitate (On the Trinity) - Augustine of Hippo (c. 399-419). Latin theological-philosophical treatise in 15 books; central Latin-era synthesis of Trinitarian doctrine for the Western church.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Composed across c. 399-419 while Augustine was bishop of Hippo in late antique North Africa.
 - Written in the aftermath of Arian controversies and amid Latin theological development; engages Platonic/Neoplatonic thought and patristic exegesis.
- **Central thesis**
 - To demonstrate that the one God is a triune communion (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), to show how Scripture and reason cohere in Trinitarian belief, and to explain how humans can know and participate in the triune life.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Work organized into 15 books: opening exegetical and polemical material; philosophical and psychological analogies in the middle books; detailed accounts of procession, generation, and the Spirit in later books.
 - Major moves:
 - Exegetical proof that Scripture implies both unity of God and real distinctions of Father, Son, Spirit.
 - Ontological account: one divine substance (essentia) with three relations (relationes) that constitute three persons (personae).
 - Psychological analogies (memory, intellect/understanding, will) as imprints of the Trinity in the human soul (imago Dei).
 - Pneumatological treatment: Spirit as mutual love/procession that binds Father and Son; emphasis on love and indwelling.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture and Latin patristic tradition; appropriates Platonic/Neoplatonic categories (e.g., from Plotinus) while correcting pagan metaphysics.
 - Implicit and explicit polemics against Sabellian modalism and Arian denial of Son's consubstantiality; indirect engagement with Cappadocians and Eastern formulations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), Christology (generation of the Son; incarnation implications), Pneumatology (procession, personhood, mission), Anthropology (imago Dei, human cognition and will), Creation, Revelation and knowledge of God.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine's theological center of gravity: the triune God is an eternal relational life revealed in Christ and mirrored by the human mind, so that true knowledge and salvation are participation in the Father, Son, and Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Relational ontology: persons are defined by relations (relatio) rather than merely by roles or modes.
 - Psychological analogy: memory, understanding, will used not as proof but as analogical mirrors of inner-Trinitarian life-grounding doctrine in human self-knowledge.
 - Love as connective principle: the Spirit construed as the love/communion that proceeds between Father and Son.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Sabellianism: insists on real personal distinction, not mere economic modes.
 - Against Arianism: defends Son's full divinity and eternal generation; emphasizes consubstantiality.
 - Differs from Eastern Cappadocians by Latin terminological moves and later Westward articulation of the Spirit's procession (contributing to the filioque trajectory).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Development of Latin vocabulary: persona, substantia/essentia, relatio, processio-shaping Western theological grammar.
 - Use of internal psychological categories as theological heuristics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Monumental influence on medieval Scholasticism, Western orthodoxy, and Reformers (e.g., Augustine as a primary resource for Calvin and later Reformed thought).
 - Source for the Western filioque tradition; cited in doctrinal controversies and creedal formulations.
 - Eastern reception mixed: admired for depth but sometimes critiqued for filioque implications and Latin philosophical methods.
- **Enduring value**
 - Model for integrating exegesis, metaphysics, and pastoral theology; remains a primary resource for Trinitarian doctrine, theological anthropology, and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Trinitas (Trinity)** - Unity of God in three persons; central thesis.
- **Persona (person)** - Latin usage refined by Augustine to mean the distinct hypostases constituted by relations.
- **Substantia / Essentia** - Divine being or essence: one and indivisible, shared by three persons.
- **Relatio (relation)** - The defining feature of each person; relations constitute personal distinctions.
- **Processio / Procession** - The origin/movement within the Godhead (not temporal); used to describe Spirit's proceeding and Son's generation.
- **Generatio (generation)** - Eternal begetting of the Son by the Father; grounds Son's distinctness and consubstantiality.
- **Memoria / Intellectus / Voluntas (memory, understanding, will)** - Psychological triad used as an analogical image of the Trinity in the human mind (imago Dei).
- **Caritas / Amor (charity/love)** - Love characterized as the Spirit or the bond of mutual indwelling between Father and Son.
- **Circumincessio / Circumincessio concept** - Mutual indwelling (though term later systematized); Augustine develops the idea of perichoresis in practice.
- **Imago Dei** - Human likeness to God explained psychologically: the triadic structure of the soul reflects God's tri-unity.
- **Consubstantialitas / Consubstantiality** - Defence of Son's and Spirit's sharing of the same divine essence.
- **Filioque (proceeds from the Son)** - Augustine's reflections contribute to Western affirmation that the Spirit proceeds from Father and Son (source of later controversy).
- **Knowledge of God (scientia Dei)** - Knowing God achieved by participation and inward likeness, not merely intellectual abstraction.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definitional source for Western Trinitarian doctrine and vocabulary (dogmatic locus).
 - Polemical toolkit against modalism and Arianism; historical resource in doctrinal controversies.
 - Exegetical and anthropological model: used to argue that human cognition discloses God's triune image and to frame pneumatology as relational and soteriological.
