### TITLE
**Jonathan Edwards and the Catholic Vision of Salvation - Gerald R. McDermott** 
(study of the theology of Jonathan Edwards; focused treatment of soteriology, with attention to Original Sin and Imputation)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary secondary study (McDermott) on an 18th-century New England Puritan (Jonathan Edwards, 1703-1758).
 - Situated against the backdrop of the Great Awakening, American Puritan orthodoxy, and later Reformed reception in evangelicalism.
 - Addresses recent historiographical debates that cast Edwards as strictly forensic or individualistic.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - McDermott argues Edwards exhibits a broadly **catholic** (i.e., patristic/creedal and ecclesial) vision of salvation: salvation as corporate, sacramental, and participatory rather than solely forensic legal transaction.
 - For the specific locus of Original Sin and Imputation, McDermott contends Edwards integrates **federal imputation** with **organic/participatory union**-holding inherited guilt and corruption while locating imputation within union with Adam and, ultimately, union with Christ.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey Edwards' texts to show recurrent themes: **vital union with Christ**, covenantal representation, and the role of ecclesial means (preaching, sacraments) in applying salvation.
 - Demonstrate Edwards' debt to Augustine and Reformation fathers while highlighting his distinctive synthesis (not a simple revival of medieval scholasticism nor a narrow forensicism).
 - Apply this syntheses to Original Sin and Imputation: Edwards accepts Adamic federal headship and imputed guilt, but emphasizes organic solidarity and moral corruption such that imputation functions within a morally efficacious union.
 - Reassess modern readings that isolate penal substitution as Edwards' only category.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Jonathan Edwards (sermons, treatises on Original Sin, The Nature of True Virtue, Religious Affections, Miscellanies).
 - Intellectual antecedents: Augustine, Calvin, selected patristic and scholastic strands.
 - Modern interlocutors: later Reformed interpreters who emphasize forensic models; ecumenical readers recovering patristic and sacramental emphases.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Original Sin**, **Imputation**, **Federal Headship**, **Union with Christ**, **Justification**, **Sanctification**, **Atonement** (penal and participatory elements), **Covenant theology**, and **ecclesiology** (means of grace, sacramental life).

- **Closing line**
 - McDermott presents Edwards' soteriology as a united vision: the Reformed doctrine of imputation is affirmed but reframed within a catholic, participatory account of redemption centered on vital union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Edwards as a theologian of **vital union**: salvation primarily as incorporation into Christ, not merely a judicial declaration.
 - Strong attention to ecclesial and sacramental mediation-preaching and means of grace are constitutive in applying union and renewing nature.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges readings that reduce Edwards to a one-dimensional penal-forensic thinker; recovers patristic and covenantal strands underemphasized in modern Calvinist historiography.
 - Revises polarized debates between "forensic-only" and "mystical-only" models by showing Edwards holds both dimensions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deployment of "catholic" as descriptive (universal church-shaped, not Roman) to recover continuity with ancient Christian categories.
 - Emphasis on the interplay of **imputation** and **organic solidarity** rather than strict mutual exclusion.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked renewed interest among evangelicals and ecumenical scholars seeking models integrating justification and sanctification.
 - Serves as a corrective for evangelical over-legalized soteriologies; useful in Protestant-Catholic dialogue on salvation's shape.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact, accessible reframing of Edwards that aids teaching on union with Christ, the corporate nature of sin and grace, and the interpretive space between forensic and participatory readings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original Sin** - inherited corruption and depravity in human nature; Edwards affirms both the corruption of nature and consequences for will and affections.
- **Imputation** - God's reckoning of Adam's sin to his posterity (and Christ's righteousness to believers); McDermott stresses Edwards' acceptance of federal imputation framed by union.
 - Relation to Original Sin: imputation explains legal culpability while organic solidarity explains moral depravity.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam as representative head; central to Edwards' account of how guilt and penalty extend.
- **Vital Union (Union with Christ)** - primary category for salvation; union effects sanctification, participation in Christ's life, and reception of righteousness.
- **Justification** - forensic aspect retained but embedded within transformative union; not exhaustive of soteriology.
- **Sanctification** - intrinsic to Edwards' vision; moral renewal and affections reformed through union and means of grace.
- **Penal Substitution** - present in Edwards' vocabulary but not exclusive; coexists with participatory atonement motifs.
- **Covenant Theology** - frames corporate relations (Adam/Christ); Edwards uses covenantal categories to explain imputation and application.
- **Sacramental/Ecclesial Mediation** - preaching, sacraments, and church life are instrumental in effecting and signifying union and grace.
- **Representation vs. Participation** - Edwards moves between representational (imputation) and participatory (vital union) language to explain salvation's mechanics.
- **Guilt vs. Corruption** - theological distinction Edwards preserves: guilt imputed, corruption transmitted and experienced.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced Edwardsian view of imputation that integrates both forensic and organic categories.
- As a **polemic** against narrow forensic-only readings of Reformed soteriology.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for teaching the interplay of union with Christ, covenantal representation, and the role of ecclesial means in salvation.
