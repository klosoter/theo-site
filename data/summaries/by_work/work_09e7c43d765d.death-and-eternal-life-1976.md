### TITLE
Death and Eternal Life (1976) - John Hick

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1970s British philosophical theology; follows Hick's influential work on the problem of evil (Evil and the God of Love, 1966).
 - Situated within liberal Protestant and philosophical theism debates-engages analytic philosophy, historical theology, and comparative religious perspectives.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How can Christian (and broader theistic) hopes for life after death be defended intellectually and theologically in a world shaped by evil and divine justice?
 - Reconsiders traditional Christian pictures (natural immortality, eternal torment) and proposes models consistent with a morally coherent, benevolent God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and critique of classical models of survival: innate immortality of the soul, resurrection, reincarnation, and annihilation.
 - Argues that personal survival is neither guaranteed by nature nor by metaphysical dualism but is a gift of God grounded in divine power and justice.
 - Recasts the afterlife as part of theodical economy: death and postmortem existence serve moral and spiritual development (soul-making/purification), and divine justice must be compatible with God's goodness.
 - Proposes that ultimate destiny should be conceived in terms of re-creation or transfigured continuation of persons, with punishment reinterpreted as corrective/Purificatory rather than infinite retributive torment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical figures (Plato, Augustine) and Reformation/Post-Reformation theology indirectly by critique of their assumptions about soul immortality and hell.
 - Dialogues with contemporary philosophers of religion and theologians concerned with theodicy, metaphysics of personal identity, and eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (central), anthropology (nature and survival of the person), theodicy/divine justice (primary theme), a subordinate critique of classical doctrines of hell and innate immortality.
 - Less focus on Trinity or systematic Christology; Christology is invoked insofar as it bears on resurrection and salvation.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The afterlife should be reconceived not as automatic continuation of an immortal soul or infinite retributive damnation, but as divine, morally intelligible re-creation or transformation of persons that coheres with a God of love and justice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes theodicy the pivotal lens for assessing doctrines of death and the afterlife: judgments about survival and punishment must answer the problem of evil and divine benevolence.
 - Moves away from metaphysical assurances (natural immortality) to a providential account: survival is a gift contingent on God's moral purposes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges Platonic and Augustinian inheritances that assume innate, automatic immortality and endorse eternal conscious torment as just.
 - Contrasts with conservative evangelical endorsements of eternal retributive hell; opposes mechanically dualistic views of the soul.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "re-creation" or "transfigured continuity" language for personal survival-neither mere static persistence of a soul nor simple annihilation.
 - Frames punishment primarily as corrective/purificatory within an eschatological pedagogy (an extension of Hick's soul-making concerns).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in liberal and philosophical theology; influenced debates on universalism, conditional immortality, and theodicy-informed eschatology.
 - Criticized by conservative theologians for downplaying biblical texts that have been read as supporting eternal punitive motifs; also critiqued by some analytic philosophers on identity-preservation arguments.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable model for linking theodicy and eschatology; durable resource for courses on death, theodicy, and modern Christian eschatology.
 - Continues to stimulate discussion on personal identity, divine justice, and plausible theological alternatives to traditional hell.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Natural immortality**
 - The inherited Platonic/Christian assumption that the soul is intrinsically immortal; Hick critiques this as unjustified metaphysically and theologically.
- **Conditional immortality**
 - The view that immortality is granted by God, not intrinsic; Hick favors this orientation as compatible with divine justice.
- **Resurrection**
 - Recast by Hick as divine re-creation/transfiguration of the person rather than mere resuscitation of a body or persistence of an immortal soul.
- **Personal identity / continuity**
 - Concerned with what it would mean for "you" to survive death; Hick argues for continuity maintained by divine action and memory rather than strict psychological or bodily persistence.
- **Soul-making theodicy**
 - Hick's larger theodical framework: evil and death function within a moral-educative process; postmortem life continues or completes moral development.
- **Divine justice**
 - Must be reconciled with divine benevolence; infinite retributive punishment is incompatible with Hick's conception of just and loving God.
- **Eternal punishment**
 - Criticized as morally problematic; reinterpreted by Hick as corrective or transformational rather than infinite suffering.
- **Annihilationism**
 - Considered and weighed: destruction of the wicked as an alternative to eternal torment; Hick treats it as one of several possible responses.
- **Post-mortem purification**
 - Hick favors models where post-death suffering serves purificatory ends, aligning with his theodical priorities.
- **Re-creation / transfigured continuation**
 - Preferred terminology for how God could secure personal survival and identity.
- **Religious experience**
 - Employed as evidential support for hope in survival; not decisive but contributes to the plausibility of afterlife claims.
- **Universalism (implications)**
 - While not dogmatically universalist in this book, Hick's emphasis on divine justice and soul-making opens theological space toward universal reconciliation.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definition/source: clarifies contemporary alternatives to innate immortality and models of resurrection.
 - As polemic: used against traditional eternal damnation doctrines and metaphysical dualism.
 - As conceptual pivot: supplies a theodicy-informed framework for rethinking eschatology and personal identity in theology.
