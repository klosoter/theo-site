### TITLE
What Saint Paul Really Said - N. T. Wright 
Research notes for advanced students

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st century Anglican scholarship; engagement with the New Perspective on Paul (NPP) and with post-Enlightenment Reformed readings. A corrective to both pietistic/individualized readings and to caricatures of NPP.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul must be read as an apocalyptic, covenantal theologian: **justification** primarily functions as the public, covenantal verdict that recognizes who belongs to God's covenant people (life in the Messiah), not merely as a forensic transfer of guilt or righteousness divorced from corporate narrative.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reconstructs Paul within Second Temple Jewish horizons and the story of Israel (salvation-history).
 - Reinterprets key Pauline language (righteousness, faith, justification) in covenantal/legal-communal terms.
 - Argues that union with Christ, participation in the Messiah, and God's faithfulness to covenant promises are central to soteriology.
 - Locates justification eschatologically - a present declaration with future vindication.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, John Barclay (NPP figures), and classical Reformers (Luther, Calvin), plus patristic and Jewish texts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, covenant, atonement, sin and original sin, imputation (criticized in classical form), union with Christ, eschatology, ecclesiology, Pauline Christology.
- **Closing line**
 - Wright re-centers Pauline theology on **covenant narrative and corporate participation in Christ**, reframing justification as the mark of covenant membership within God's salvation-history.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Historia salutis** (salvation-history) over abstract, schematic ordo salutis; narrative reading of Paul's letters.
 - Emphasis on **corporate/representative** realities (Israel, Adam, Christ) rather than primarily individual forensic transactions.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against a reductive forensic-imputation model that detaches justification from covenant and eschatology.
 - Also distances himself from some NPP accounts that neglect judgment, atonement, or Pauline forensic language entirely - seeks a middle path: historically rooted, biblically constrained reinterpretation.
- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Stresses **justification-as-declaration-of-membership** and **participation/union with Christ** rather than simple credited righteousness.
 - Reframes "faith" to include **faithfulness** and covenantal allegiance; reads "righteousness of God" as God's covenantal faithfulness and saving act.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential: galvanized renewed exegetical debate on justification; prompted re-evaluations in Reformed, Anglican, and evangelical circles.
 - Criticized by some classical Reformed theologians for allegedly undermining forensic imputation; embraced by others as a corrective to individualistic soteriology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies rigorous historical-contextual exegesis; serves as a durable polemical and pedagogical resource for rethinking Pauline soteriology in covenantal terms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification**
 - For Wright: primarily a public, covenantal declaration of who belongs to God's people; eschatological and communal as well as individual.
- **Righteousness of God**
 - Interpreted as God's covenantal faithfulness and saving action rather than merely an attribute credited to believers.
- **Faith / Pistis**
 - Emphasizes **faith/faithfulness** (subjective trust and objective reliability), and sometimes the faithfulness of Christ as decisive.
- **Union with Christ / Participation**
 - Central soteriological category: salvation is lived-in and by participation in the Messiah.
- **Covenant / Covenantal Nomism**
 - Restores corporate covenant language: election and covenant membership explain Paul's concern for Israel and Gentile inclusion.
- **Forensic imputation (classical)**
 - Wright critiques a narrow formulation that views justification solely as the legal transfer of Christ's righteousness onto individuals.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Wright aligns with some NPP insights (first-century Jewish context) but departs where he believes NPP minimizes divine judgment, atonement, or the language of righteousness.
- **Historia salutis vs Ordo salutis**
 - Wright privileges **historia salutis** (God's saving acts and story) over abstract systematic sequences (ordo salutis); insists theological loci must be read within God's historical saving narrative.
- **Original sin / Adamic imputation**
 - Read corporately: Adam as representative head and the entrance of sin as a historical corporate reality; Wright nuance: resists simplistic forensic transfer models while affirming corporate solidarity and its cosmic consequences.
- **Eschaton / Eschatological justification**
 - Justification includes present declaration and future vindication at Christ's return; temporal dynamics matter.
- **Apocalyptic context**
 - Paul reads Israel's present failure and God's future restoration in apocalyptic categories; this frames soteriology.

- **Site usage (selected references within the work)**
 - *Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis*: Wright's sustained emphasis on reading Paul within salvation-history and critique of abstract ordo models (see his thematic discussions on Pauline narrative and justification).
 - *Justification / Forensic imputation / NPP critiques*: Wright's sustained critique of narrow forensic imputation and his engagement with Sanders/Dunn (see chapters treating "justification" and responses to New Perspective interlocutors).
 - *Original sin and imputation*: Wright's treatment of Adamic representation and corporate sin (see sections addressing Adam, death, and corporate solidarity). 
- **How this work is used**
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenantal, narrative Pauline theology.
 - As a **polemic** against reductive forensic imputation and against simplistic readings on both sides of the NPP debate.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** when teaching justification, union with Christ, and salvation-history in postgraduate and seminary contexts.
