### TITLE
**The Miracles of Jesus: How the Savior's Mighty Acts Serve as Signs of Redemption** - Vern Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical milieu; Poythress writes as a conservative Reformed New Testament theologian seeking to recover a covenantal, redemptive-historical reading of the Gospels. Pastoral-intent: equip preaching, apologetics, and theology of the church.
- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus' miracles are purposeful **signs** that manifest and inaugurate the redemptive kingdom: they both authenticate the Messiah and enact what the kingdom restores (healing, forgiveness, authority), thus pointing ahead to consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define "miracle" as a communicative, covenantal "sign-act" rather than mere spectacle.
 - Exegetical treatment of representative miracles (healing, exorcism, provision, raising the dead) emphasizing their symbolic content and soteriological function.
 - The miracles function on multiple axes:
 - **Epistemic**: authenticate Jesus' authority and messianic identity.
 - **Redemptive-historical**: anticipate eschatological restoration.
 - **Pastoral/ethic**: model power that yields mercy and invites faith.
 - Concludes by linking miracles to Word and sacrament: signs that point to Christ's ongoing reign and redeeming work in the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary reliance on Gospel narratives; engages patristic and Reformational readings (typology in Calvin), and interacts with modern evangelical commentators who separate sign from saving function.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant/redemption history, Christology (incarnation, mediatorial authority), pneumatology (Spirit's role in power and union), soteriology (forgiveness/healing nexus), ecclesiology (witness and continuation of signs).
 - Explicit attention to implications for **Spirit and union with Christ**, **spiritual gifts and sanctification**, and **impeccability of Christ**.
- **Closing line**
 - Miracles are not isolated wonders but communicative, covenantal signs that incarnate and announce Christ's redeeming reign, binding Christology, pneumatology, and eschatology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats miracles as multi-layered "sign-acts": simultaneously revelatory, salvific, and typological within covenant history.
 - Strong integration of miracles with Word/Sacrament language-miracles function like visible proclamations of redemptive truth.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Liberal demythologizing that reduces miracles to myth or moral example.
 - Reductionist charismatic readings that detach miracles from Christ's person and redemptive-historical meaning.
 - Offers a corrective to readings that treat miracles merely as credentialing proofs for apostolic authority by stressing their kingdom content.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic use of "sign-act" language and typological/sacramental analogy to link miracle-events with covenantal promises.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed preaching and academic circles for its careful exegesis and theological synthesis; used as a model for integrating narrative-exegesis with doctrinal theology.
 - Influential as a resource for conservative evangelicals addressing contemporary debates over gifts, signs, and the nature of redemptive action.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable exegetical-theological framework for teaching on miracles that preserves both divine action and theological meaning for sanctification, union with Christ, and doctrinal fidelity (e.g., on Christ's impeccability).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sign / Sign-act**
 - Miracle as communicative action that points beyond itself to redemption and Christ's identity.
- **Kingdom inauguration**
 - Miracles as present signs of the eschatological restoration inaugurated in Christ.
- **Redemptive-historical reading**
 - Interpreting miracles within covenant progress rather than as isolated marvels.
- **Typology / sacramental analogy**
 - Miracles function like sacraments: visible acts that convey and signify redemptive reality.
- **Authority of Christ**
 - Miracles as demonstration of messianic, royal, and priestly authority.
- **Healing-forgiveness nexus**
 - Theological link Poythress emphasizes: physical restoration often accompanies or symbolizes spiritual forgiveness.
- **Eschatological anticipation**
 - Miracles point forward to consummation; they are foretaste and pledge.
- **Spirit and union with Christ**
 - Uses miracles to illustrate how the Spirit actualizes Christ's presence and benefits in believers (see pneumatological chapters on empowerment and union).
 - Application: supports a view that miracles manifest the Spirit-mediated presence of the risen Christ.
- **Spiritual gifts and sanctification**
 - Grounds contemporary discussions of gifts in Christ's redemptive acts: miracles function as normative signs that invite sanctified use of power in service and witness.
 - Application: resource for arguing that gifts are ordered to sanctification and covenant life, not spectacle.
- **Impeccability of Christ**
 - Affirms that Christ's miracles flow from the sinless exercise of divine-human authority; miracles do not imply moral fallibility.
 - Application: used to defend classic Reformed formulations of Christ's impeccability while accounting for his active redemptive work.
- **Witness / authentication**
 - Miracles as apologetic and ecclesial witness to Jesus' identity and mission.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "miracle" as a covenantal sign-act, useful in Christology and sacramental theology.
- As a **polemic** against demythologizing and unanchored charismatic excess-anchors signs to Christ's person and covenant work.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching the Gospels: close textual reading combined with theological synthesis linking miracles to sanctification, Spirit-union, and the doctrine of Christ's impeccability.
