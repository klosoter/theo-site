### TITLE
Willem van Asselt, "Francis Turretin and the Reformed Doctrine of the New Creation" (study of Francis Turretin)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Examination of seventeenth-century Reformed scholasticism centered on Francis Turretin (1623-1687) within post-Reformation orthodox milieu.
 - Van Asselt writes as a modern Reformed historian, reading Turretin against the background of confessional polemics (Arminianism/Amyraldianism, Socinianism, Roman Catholicism), early modern metaphysics, and debates about bodily resurrection and the renewal of creation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Turretin articulates the "new creation" as both *already* (regeneration, sanctification in the believer) and *not-yet* (consummation at Christ's return) - a theologically robust Reformed account that preserves bodily continuity while securing radical ontological renovation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Turretin's treatments across loci (soteriology, Christology, eschatology, pneumatology), showing:
 - Regeneration as the beginning of the new creation by the Spirit (inauguration).
 - Resurrection and final judgment as the consummation where creation is transformed, not annihilated (continuity in identity; discontinuity in glory).
 - Scriptural exegesis (esp. Pauline and Johannine texts; prophetic images of "new heavens and a new earth") used to rebut dualistic/spiritualizing and materialistic readings.
 - Doctrinal defense against millenarianism and speculative cosmologies by appeal to covenant theology and classical attributes of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Francis Turretin (Institutes of Elenctic Theology).
 - Interlocutors: Amyraldian and Arminian critics, Socinians, Roman Catholic scholastics, contemporary interpreters who spiritualize eschatology, and millenarians.
 - Scripture as chief warrant; classical Reformed confessions and scholastic method employed.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (new heavens and new earth), soteriology (regeneration, justification, sanctification), Christology (mediatorial role in new creation), pneumatology (Spirit as agent of renewal), resurrection of the body, covenant theology, doctrine of God (immutability and creative action).
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin, as read by van Asselt, centers the Reformed doctrine of the new creation on a covenantal, Christocentric, Spirit-wrought renewal that guarantees bodily and cosmic continuity transformed into eschatological glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on *real* physical continuity of creation: the world is not replaced by a wholly different substance but is renewed and glorified.
 - Emphasis on union with Christ as the ontological hinge for new-creation identity-what Christ is for believers applies to creation through covenantal ties.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against spiritualizing interpreters who reduce the new creation to purely inner, moral renewal.
 - Rejection of annihilationist or replacement models common in some speculative philosophies; also corrective to chiliasm by subordinating millennial schemes to biblical covenantal eschatology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of scholastic precision to frame "new creation" as a technical category crossing soteriology and eschatology: inaugurated renewal (regeneratio) vs consummated renovation (renovatio/consummatio).
 - Tightening the link between covenantal promises and cosmic eschatology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Turretin's account became a touchstone in later Reformed orthodoxy and influenced confessional teaching in Reformed academies and, via authorship legacy, later Princeton and confessional movements.
 - Van Asselt's study helps recover Turretin for contemporary theological discussions about ecological hope and bodily resurrection.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodologically rigorous, biblically anchored model for articulating eschatological hope that resists both sentimental spiritualizing and reductive materialism; valuable for teaching on creation care, resurrection, and covenantal continuity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New creation** - central category: both present (regeneration) and future (cosmic renewal).
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - beginning of the new age in the Spirit-work of regeneration.
- **Consummation / renovation** - final transformation of creation at Christ's return; continuity plus glorification.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological ground for believers' participation in the new creation.
- **Regeneration (regeneratio)** - Spirit-initiated new birth as the start of new-creation reality in the believer.
- **Resurrection of the body** - guarantor of bodily continuity and concrete renewal of the created order.
- **Covenant of grace** - theological framework linking soteriology to cosmic promise; source of eschatological assurance.
- **New heavens and new earth** - scriptural locus for Turretin's exegetical defense of renovative continuity.
- **Pneumatology** - Spirit as agent of present renewal and future consummation.
- **Anti-spiritualism** - polemic posture against readings that dematerialize eschatology.
- **Anti-chiliasm** - rejection of speculative millennial systems outside covenantal exegesis.
- **Continuity/discontinuity** - technical balance: same creation transformed in nature and glory.
- **Divine immutability vs creaturely change** - Turretin's theological handling: God's immutable will accomplishes decisive, contingent transformation in creation.
- **Eschatological hope** - practical pastoral emphasis rooted in covenant promises and resurrection faith.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of the "new creation" across soteriology and eschatology.
- As a **polemic model** against spiritualizing or materialist distortions of eschatology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading "new heavens and new earth" texts in covenantal and Christocentric ways.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking doctrine of salvation, resurrection, and ecological/creation-care concerns.
