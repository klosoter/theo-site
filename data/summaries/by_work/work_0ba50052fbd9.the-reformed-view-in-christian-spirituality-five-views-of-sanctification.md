### TITLE
**"The Reformed View" - Sinclair B. Ferguson (in Christian Spirituality: Five Views of Sanctification)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contribution to a late 20th-century multiview volume aimed at evangelical readers; offered a confessional Reformed account of sanctification in dialog with Wesleyan, Roman Catholic, Pentecostal, and other perspectives.
 - Written from a covenantal, Westminster-influenced vantage point shaped by Reformed pastoral and academic concerns.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Sanctification must be understood both **definitively** (positional reality in union with Christ) and **progressively** (Spirit-led growth in holiness), always within the covenant of grace and dependent on the Spirit's historical and present ministry.
 - Responds to errors on both sides: over-realized perfectionism and moralistic/legalistic understandings that separate justification and sanctification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with biblical and confessional warrant: union with Christ as the root of all Christian standing and life.
 - Articulates **definitive sanctification**: believers are set apart by Christ's work and the Spirit's initial saving act (regeneration/indwelling).
 - Develops **progressive sanctification**: Spirit-instrumented means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer, church discipline) foster mortification and vivification.
 - Shows how covenantal promises and obligations shape assurance, pastoral care, and communal accountability.
 - Ends with pastoral implications: preaching, sacraments, and disciplined Christian living as the church's responsibility in the Spirit's work.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Scripture, the Westminster Confession and catechisms, classic Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin, Owen), and contemporary Reformed pastoral writers.
 - Engages Wesleyan perfectionism, certain pietistic utopianisms, and relational/spirituality trends that underemphasize objective covenantal reality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Soteriology:** justification, imputation, definitive vs progressive sanctification.
 - **Pneumatology:** regeneration, indwelling, Spirit's role in redemptive history and ongoing sanctification.
 - **Covenant theology:** covenant of grace as framework for sanctification and discipline.
 - **Christology / Communicatio idiomatum:** union with Christ as ground for participation in Christ's holiness.

- **Closing line**
 - Sanctification is the Spirit-wrought outworking of our covenantal union with Christ: a definitive status given in grace and a lifelong progressive conformity to the image of Christ through means ordained by God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly integrates **confessional covenant language** with pastoral application; sanctification is simultaneously forensic (given) and transformative (applied).
 - Emphasizes the **Spirit in redemptive history**-not only as present help but as the actor who applied redemption historically and continues to apply it in believers.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Wesleyan-style instantaneous perfection claims by insisting on the ongoing reality of indwelling sin and need for progressive mortification.
 - Opposes privatized spirituality and therapeutic religion by rooting holiness in covenant obligations and ecclesial means of grace.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Uses an **analogical appeal to communicatio idiomatum**: the believer's union with Christ functions analogically to the communicatio of attributes-positionally sharing in Christ's holiness while ontologically distinct.
 - Clarifies **preparatory/common grace** language for evangelistic and moral contexts: God's common grace prepares and restrains, but sanctification proper is covenantal and Spirit-wrought.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed pastoral training and adult instruction; cited in debates over perfectionism, assurance, and the role of means of grace.
 - Influenced pastors and teachers seeking a balanced Reformed pastoral theology of holiness.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, pastorally sensitive, confessional model that bridges academic theology and congregational practice; durable for preaching, discipleship, and polemics within evangelical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definitive sanctification**
 - Positional holiness granted in union with Christ; believers are set apart in status before God.

- **Progressive sanctification**
 - Ongoing moral and spiritual transformation effected by the Spirit through means of grace.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Root metaphysic: all benefits (justification, sanctification, glorification) flow from vital union.

- **Covenant of grace**
 - Framework for promises, obligations, means (Word, sacraments), assurance, and ecclesial discipline.

- **Regeneration and indwelling**
 - Regeneration as Spirit's instantaneous new birth; indwelling as the Spirit's ongoing presence enabling sanctification.

- **Spirit in redemptive history**
 - The Spirit not only empowers believers now but is the historical agent who applies Christ's redemption (Pentecost onward).

- **Common grace / preparatory grace**
 - God's restraining and preparatory work in the non-elect and unconverted that precedes or accompanies evangelization; distinct from saving grace.

- **Communicatio idiomatum (analogical use)**
 - Employed analogically to explain how believers partake of Christ's holiness positionally without confusing natures.

- **Means of grace**
 - Word, sacraments, prayer, fellowship, and discipline as Spirit-ordained instruments of sanctification.

- **Mortification & vivification**
 - Paired pastoral practices: putting sin to death and nurturing new life in Christ.

- **Imputation vs impartation**
 - Imputation: forensic accounting of righteousness; impartation: the Spirit's actual changing work-both necessary to Ferguson's account.

- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in covenant promises and objective union with Christ, not mere subjective feeling.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed sanctification (distinguishing definitive/progressive).
- As a **polemic** against Wesleyan perfectionism and de-contextualized spirituality.
- As an **exegetical model** for union with Christ and Spirit-applied redemption.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology linking confession (WCF), pneumatology, and practical sanctification.
