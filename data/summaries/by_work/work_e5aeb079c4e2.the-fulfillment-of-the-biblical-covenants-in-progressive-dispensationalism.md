### TITLE
The Fulfillment of the Biblical Covenants (Progressive Dispensationalism) - Craig A. Blaising

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate (1990s onward) within Dispensationalism; Blaising is a founder of *Progressive Dispensationalism* which seeks to reform classical dispensational categories while retaining key distinctions.
 - Movemental milieu: reaction to both classical dispensationalism (sharp Israel/church divide) and covenant/replacement theology (full continuity/replacement of Israel).
 - Site usage: engages the topic of *Dispensationalism and Progressive Covenantalism*; exegetical attention given to Pauline passages, especially *Romans 11 and Israel's future*.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical covenants are progressively revealed and find their climax in Christ; covenant promises are *partially fulfilled* in the church now and await consummation for Israel and the world in the eschaton.
 - Seeks to reconcile continuity of redemptive promises with distinction of peoples and future fulfillment.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutical framing: canonical, historical-grammatical exegesis that attends to typology and fulfillment language.
 - Covenant survey: Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, Land, and New Covenant promises are analyzed for present/partial fulfillment and future consummation.
 - Ecclesiological and eschatological consequences: argues for an *already/not-yet* realization of covenantal blessings - the church participates in promised blessings, but definitive covenantal fulfillment awaits the consummation, including a distinct role for ethnic Israel.
 - Pauline engagement: Romans 9-11 used to defend hope for national restoration of Israel without dismantling the church's present status in redemptive history.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with classical dispensationalists (e.g., John Walvoord, Charles Ryrie), covenant theologians (Reformed writers), and with contemporary evangelical exegetes.
 - Uses Old and New Testament covenantal texts, plus patristic and Reformation-era covenantal categories where relevant.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (structure and continuity), revelation (progressive fulfillment), Christology (Christ as center of covenant fulfillment), eschatology (inaugurated eschatology), ecclesiology (relationship of Israel and church), election and promises.

- **Closing line**
 - Blaising frames the covenants as a unified, progressive trajectory fulfilled in Christ but awaiting final consummation in history - preserving continuity of promise while affirming eschatological distinctions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic insistence on *progressive fulfillment*: covenants are neither fully realized in the present nor irrelevant - they are inaugurated in Christ and carried toward consummation.
 - Maintains a measured distinction between Israel and the church without endorsing classical isolation of dispensations.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects classical dispensational sharp separations (e.g., absolute, exclusive fulfilments) by asserting overlap and continuity.
 - Rejects wholesale replacement theology: promises to Israel retain future validity (Romans 11 is pivotal here).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes language of *already/not-yet* covenantal fulfillment within a dispensational framework.
 - Emphasizes *typological fulfillment* where church realities are types or initial realizations of fuller future reality to come for Israel and the nations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among evangelicals seeking a middle way; formative for many conservative seminaries and commentaries.
 - Criticized by classical dispensationalists for eroding distinctives and by strict covenant theologians for preserving too much ethnic particularism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an exegetically oriented model that is pedagogically useful for teaching covenants, bridging polemical divides, and instructing on Israel-church relations in eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Abrahamic Covenant** - promise of land, seed, blessing; seen as both inaugurated in Christ and awaiting fuller, eschatological realization.
- **Davidic Covenant** - throne/kingdom promise; fulfilled in Christ's messianic reign now inaugurated and consummated later.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - covenantal law as pedagogical and typological, not nullifying promises to Israel.
- **Land Promise** - both a present spiritual participation (church) and future concrete fulfillment for Israel.
- **New Covenant** - central for Blaising: instituted in Christ (present salvation) but contains future elements tied to national Israel and consummation.
- **Fulfillment / Progressive Fulfillment** - key hermeneutical principle: promises can be realized in stages across redemptive history.
- **Already / Not-Yet** - eschatological framework applied to covenantal fulfillment; informs ecclesiology and kingdom theology.
- **Continuity and Discontinuity** - diagnostic pair used to navigate similarities and differences between Israel and the church.
- **Typology** - method: present realities serve as types or initial realizations of fuller eschatological realities.
- **Remnant** - theological category (from Romans 9-11) stressing God's preservation of believing Israel and pointing to future restoration.
- **Romans 11** - exegetical locus for arguing Israel's future: supports hope for a national turning and vindicates future covenantal fulfillment.
- **People of God** - emphasized unity in redemptive history while preserving ethnic distinctions that retain eschatological significance.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology** - Christ as the beginning of the end; covenants inaugurated and awaiting consummation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Progressive Dispensationalism's handling of covenants and eschatology.
 - As an **exegetical model and polemic** in debates over Israel's future (esp. Romans 11) and over continuity vs discontinuity between Israel and the church.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in constructing conservative evangelical curricula that avoid both replacement theology and classical dispensational bifurcation.
