### TITLE
Scholia on the Incarnation of the Only-Begotten - Cyril of Alexandria

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 5th century (c. 412-436). Cyril, bishop of Alexandria, writing in the late antique Christological controversies between Alexandrian (antiochene) exegetical methods and the rising Nestorian tendency.
 - Milieu: defense of the unity of Word and flesh against perceived Christological division; preparation for and influence on the Council of Ephesus (431) and later Chalcedonian formulations.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To demonstrate that the divine Logos is truly and personally incarnate (the Word became flesh) so that Christ is one Person (hypostasis) in whom both divinity and humanity are united without confusion or separation.
 - Key polemical target: a two-subject Christology that would make the human Jesus a separate person from the Word (Nestorianism).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of **eternal Sonship**: the Logos is the Only-Begotten Son eternally, not merely a human adoption at baptism or exaltation.
 - Assertion of the **hypostatic union**: the human nature is assumed by the one divine Person; after assumption there is a single subject of operations and salvific acts.
 - Repeated scriptural exegesis: use of Gospel texts to bind the Word to the historical Jesus (e.g., "God was in Christ", "It is not I, but Christ who lives in me" style arguments).
 - Logical-philosophical moves: distinction of nature (physis) and person (hypostasis/prosopon) to avoid either confusion (Apollinarianism) or division (Nestorianism).
 - Use of christsological predication: communicatio idiomatum articulated practically - properties of both natures can be predicated of the single Person.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Opponents: Nestorius (and Antiochene interpreters like Theodoret indirectly); theological heirs of Theodore of Mopsuestia.
 - Allies and sources: Alexandrian exegetical tradition (Origenic and Alexandrian typology), prior Cappadocians for Trinitarian categories; Cyril interacts with Scripture, liturgical confession, and pastoral concerns.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (intrinsic to Sonship), Christology (Incarnation, two natures in one Person), soteriology (saving economy presupposes union), ecclesiology (Theotokos confession), christological language (prosopon, hypostasis, physis).
- **Closing line**
 - Cyril centers Christian faith on the **personal union**: the eternal Son truly assumes human nature so that salvation is wrought by one Subject - the incarnate Word.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of **personal unity** over abstract metaphysical separation: Christ is one subject who acts, suffers, and saves.
 - Strong insistence on the **Theotokos** as a doctrinal safeguard: calling Mary God-bearer preserves the personal unity of Word and flesh.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes Antiochene tendency to preserve natures by over-emphasizing separation, warning that this fragments salvation.
 - Rejects Apollinarian reduction of human nature; insists genuine human soul and body are assumed.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Favors language of the Word "assuming" flesh producing a **mia physis tou Theou Logou sesarkomene** (one nature of God the Word incarnate) - formulation later canonical in debates, though subject to nuanced interpretation at Chalcedon.
 - Robust practical use of **communicatio idiomatum**: predicates of deity and humanity attributed to the single Person, grounded in the hypostatic union rather than an equivocal juxtaposition of attributes.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely authoritative in Eastern Orthodoxy; Cyril's formulations shaped Ephesus (431) and informed Chalcedonian balancing.
 - In Western and Reformed traditions, Cyril is used selectively: valued for defense of the unity of Christ's person and the reality of atonement; reformers cited his anti-Nestorian thrust but sometimes distanced from ambiguous "one nature" phraseology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, pastorally-driven model of how incarnation secures salvation: not merely a theological abstraction but a confession that God became truly human in a single person.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incarnation (Encar­nation of the Only-Begotten)**: central event - the Logos assuming full human nature so that God acts personally in history.
- **Eternal Sonship**: the Logos is Son from eternity; his sonship is not produced by the incarnation but is the ground for it.
 - Links eternal relation within Trinity to historical economy.
- **Hypostatic Union**: the union of two natures in one hypostasis/person; Cyril emphasizes personal identity as decisive.
- **Physis (nature)**: used carefully - human and divine natures recognized, but after assumption Cyril often speaks of "one nature of the Word incarnate" to stress unity.
- **Prosopon / Hypostasis**: terms distinguishing person/subject (prosopon/hypostasis) from nature; Cyril uses them to defend single-subject predication.
- **Logos (Word)**: the divine subject who assumes a human nature; central actor in salvation.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**: the mutual attribution of properties - divine and human properties are spoken of the one Jesus because of hypostatic union.
 - Cyril grounds communicatio in personal identity, not in a mere moral or functional union.
- **Theotokos**: "God-bearer"; a doctrinal formula that protects affirmation of the Word's personal assumption of flesh.
- **Assumption / Sesarkomene**: language of the Word becoming flesh; stresses real assumption rather than mere enclosure or indwelling.
- **Soteriology (atonement)**: union is the condition for real atoning acts - only God assumed in Christ can reconcile humanity.
- **Opposite errors**: Nestorianism (division of persons) and Apollinarianism (denial of full humanity) are repeatedly rejected.
- **Predicate transfer**: method by which Scripture attributes suffering, death, etc., to the Son; Cyril insists this reflects one subject, not double subjects.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** source: classic anti-Nestorian arsenal defending the unity of Christ's person.
- As an **exegetical model**: demonstrating how Gospel predicates bind divine subject to human history (model for communicatio idiomatum).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in doctrinal formulation: influences Chalcedonian balancing and later theological treatments of incarnational union.
