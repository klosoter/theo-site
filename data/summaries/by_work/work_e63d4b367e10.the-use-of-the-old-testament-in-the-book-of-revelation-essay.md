### TITLE
The Use of the Old Testament in the Book of Revelation - Peter J. Gentry (essay)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th / early 21st century evangelical-Reformed scholarly milieu marked by renewed interest in canonical and redemptive-historical hermeneutics; dialogue with intertextual studies of NT use of the OT and with commentators on Revelation (classical and contemporary).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Revelation repeatedly employs the Old Testament not as decorative quotation or mere prophecy but as a sustained, typological-canonical resource whose fulfillment is realized in Christ and the church; understanding this use is indispensable for correct Christology, eschatology, and ecclesiology in Revelation.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Demonstrates modes of OT use in Revelation: explicit citation, echo/allusion, and structural typology. 
 - Argues for *figural* or *typological* reading: OT events, persons, and symbols function as *types* fulfilled in Christ (antitype) and in the people of God. 
 - Shows how canonical context governs meaning: Revelation presupposes the OT's promises and covenant patterns rather than treating OT texts as autonomous predictions. 
 - Applies this methodology to key loci (e.g., temple imagery, Lamb motif, Zion, Babylon) to show continuity and fulfillment. 
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Dialogues with earlier apocalyptic interpreters and commentators (classical exegesis and modern critics). 
 - Interacts with contemporaries in canonical and intertextual studies (e.g., G. K. Beale, Richard Bauckham) and with typological/ redemptive-historical interpreters from the Reformed tradition. 
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation (hermeneutics and content), Christology (Lamb, enthronement), Covenant theology (promise/fulfillment), Ecclesiology (church as pilgrim/city), Eschatology (realized/consummated aspects), Inspiration and canonicity (authority of OT texts in NT reading).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 Revelation reads the Old Testament canonically and typologically so that Christ, the church, and the consummation are the living antitypes of Israel's Scriptures - bridging promise and fulfillment within a covenant-historical framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Elevates *typology as canonical practice* rather than private allegory; typology is presented as the normal hermeneutical link between Testaments. 
 - Prioritizes *intertextual density* - many Revelation images are meaningful only within the network of OT references taken together.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Moves against purely allegorical or detached spiritualizing readings that ignore OT authorial intent and historical setting. 
 - Critiques futurist or dispensational treatments that divorce Revelation's imagery from its covenantal and typological roots in Israel's Scriptures.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:** 
 - Uses phrases such as *canonical-typological reading* and stresses *fulfillment-as-identity* (the OT figure's identity finds its locus in Christ/the church). 
 - Distinguishes carefully between *explicit citation* and *echo/allusion/typological resonance* in apocalyptic intertextuality.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Adopted and cited in Reformed and evangelical circles seeking robust OT-NT continuity; influenced exegetical models for Revelation in commentaries and preaching. 
 - Has become a touchstone for those defending redemptive-historical preaching and for scholars mapping Revelation's intertextual fabric.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Offers a practiced method for tracing theological continuity across Testaments; useful for sermon preparation, classroom exegesis, and advanced research on apocalyptic imagery.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology:** OT persons/events as foreshadowing realities fulfilled in Christ/the church; central hermeneutical move in the essay. 
- **Antitype / Type:** Antitype = the fulfillment (Christ/church); Type = the OT prefiguration (e.g., Lamb-Christ/Passover lamb). 
- **Intertextuality:** The network of explicit citations and implicit echoes that Revelation weaves from the OT. 
- **Fulfillment (canonical sense):** Not merely predictive fulfillment but ontological realization - the antitype embodies the type's identity. 
- **Allusion vs. Quotation:** Distinguishes overt citation (often formulaic) from subtle echoing that shapes imagery and meaning. 
- **Redemptive-historical / Canonical reading:** Reading OT texts within the flow of God's covenanted promises culminating in Christ. 
- **Covenant continuity:** The theological principle that Revelation reads OT promises as belonging to the same covenantal people now fulfilled. 
- **Figural exegesis:** Reading OT persons/events as figures whose meaning is expanded and completed in NT reality. 
- **Temple / Sanctuary imagery:** Treated as fulfilled and reinterpreted in Christ and the worshiping community. 
- **Lamb motif:** Central Christological image traced to sacrificial and messianic OT patterns. 
- **Zion / Babylon motifs:** Civic/soteriological typology for the people of God vs. corrupt power. 
- **Eschatological realization:** Fulfillment includes both present (already) and consummative (not yet) dimensions.
- **Promise-fulfillment pattern:** The structural move across texts: promise (OT) -> anticipation (typological echo) -> realization (Revelation/Christ/church).

How this work is used across loci: 
- As an **exegetical model** for tracing OT intertextuality in Revelation and NT apocalyptic. 
- As a **definition source** for typology conceived within canonical and covenantal theology. 
- As a **polemic tool** against hermeneutical approaches that sever OT-NT continuity (e.g., extreme allegory or strict dispensationalism).
