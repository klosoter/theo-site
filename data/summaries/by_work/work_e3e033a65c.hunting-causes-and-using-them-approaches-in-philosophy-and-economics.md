### TITLE
**Hunting Causes and Using Them: Approaches in Philosophy and Economics - Nancy Cartwright**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published mid-2000s in philosophy of science and economics; builds on Cartwrights earlier work on capacities, nomological machines, and the critique of universal laws.
 - Situated within debates about causal inference, econometric methodology, and the role of randomized trials versus case-based evidence.
 - Responds to increasing emphasis on experimental methods (RCTs) and formal causal models (potential outcomes, graphical models) in economics and policy.

- **Central thesis**
 - There is a crucial distinction between *hunting causes* (discovering and justifying causal claims) and *using causes* (applying causal knowledge for intervention and prediction). Different methods and standards are required for each task; no single method suffices.
 - Causal knowledge is best thought of in terms of **capacities** and **context-bound mechanisms**, not universal exceptionless laws.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify the distinction between discovery and application: evidence that suffices to *hunt* a cause (e.g., correlations, case studies, mechanistic evidence) often differs from what justifies *using* that cause in a new context (requires stability, calibration, understanding of mechanisms).
 - Argue for **methodological pluralism**: combination of experiments, case studies, mechanistic investigation, and theoretical modeling is necessary.
 - Emphasize the role of **nomological machines** and stable capacities: mechanisms producing reliable regularities in specific setups.
 - Critique singular reliance on one methodology (e.g., econometric identification strategies or RCTs) for either discovering or applying causal claims.
 - Provide practical guidance for policy inference: identify conditions for external validity, test and calibrate models across contexts, and pursue mechanistic evidence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages with philosophers of science (Humean regularists, interventionist/manipulation accounts), methodologists in economics (econometricians advocating identification strategies; proponents of RCTs), and theorists of causation (work on mechanisms and capacities).
 - Dialogues implicitly with views associated with the Rubin causal model, Pearl-style graphical models, and earlier Cartwright work on capacities and nomological machines.

- **Doctrines treated (theological-angle)**
 - No direct treatment of classical theological doctrines; however relevant to theological method insofar as it bears on:
 - *Providence and divine action*: caution about extrapolating causal claims from one domain to claims about God/world action.
 - *Miracle and intervention*: distinction between evidence for an event and using that evidence to predict or affect future occurrences.
 - *Method in theology*: model pluralism and context-sensitivity for doctrinal reasoning and pastoral application.

- **Closing line**
 - The work's methodological center of gravity: **causal knowledge is context-sensitive, mechanistic, and plural-methodic - hunt carefully, but be even more careful when you try to use what you have hunted.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp, operative distinction between *hunting* and *using* causes as separate epistemic tasks.
 - Stress on **capacities** and **nomological machines** rather than universal laws or mere regularities.
 - Strong prescription for plural, context-attentive methods rather than methodological monism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects the view that randomized trials or formal identification strategies alone solve all causal questions.
 - Opposes simple regularity or covering-law accounts of causation by emphasizing mechanistic, context-dependent production of effects.
 - Pushes back against formalist confidence in extrapolation without mechanistic checks (a corrective to some econometric and graphic-model approaches).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Refinement and operationalization of **hunting vs using** as two-phase epistemic framework.
 - Renewed framing of **capacities** as central to causal ontology and epistemology.
 - Clear articulation of **external validity** as a distinct, nontrivial problem requiring mechanistic and calibration work.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in philosophy of science, methodology of economics, and policy studies for its practical orientation and pluralism.
 - Influenced debates about the limits of RCTs, the importance of mechanisms, and standards for policy inference.
 - Adopted as a corrective in interdisciplinary methodological training; less uptake where formal statistical identification dominates.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers durable methodological humility: teaches scholars to match methods to epistemic aims.
 - Provides a pragmatic framework useful across disciplines (economics, public policy, theology) for reasoning from evidence to action.
 - Useful pedagogically for illustrating the gap between justification and application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hunting causes**
 - The epistemic activity of discovering, justifying, or establishing causal claims in specific cases or studies.

- **Using causes**
 - The activity of applying causal claims in interventions, predictions, or policy across contexts; requires additional validation.

- **Capacities**
 - Dispositional properties or tendencies of entities that produce effects under appropriate conditions; central ontological unit for causation.

- **Nomological machines**
 - Stable, engineered or natural setups that reliably produce regularities by arranging capacities and conditions.

- **External validity**
 - The problem of whether causal claims established in one context will hold in another; requires mechanistic understanding and calibration.

- **Mechanisms**
 - Structured processes or arrangements of capacities that explain how causes produce effects; evidence for mechanisms supports transferability.

- **Calibration**
 - Adjusting models and causal claims to fit new contexts by testing, tuning parameters, and checking assumptions.

- **Methodological pluralism**
 - The thesis that multiple, complementary methods are necessary to both hunt and use causes effectively.

- **Interventionist / manipulability concerns**
 - Cartwright situates but critiques narrow manipulability accounts; interventions matter but must be contextually realized via capacities.

- **Patchwork of models / idealization**
 - Models as tools providing context-bound, often idealized representations useful for different epistemic tasks.

- **Stability**
 - The persistence of causal relations under relevant changes of conditions; prerequisite for using causes.

- **Ceteris paribus**
 - Recognition that causal claims often implicitly rely on background conditions that must be controlled or understood.

- **Evidence pluralism**
 - Acceptance that experiments, case studies, mechanistic investigation, and statistical analysis each contribute distinct justificatory roles.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for capacities-oriented causal ontology.
- As a **polemic** against methodological monism (e.g., "RCT-only" or exclusively formal identification strategies).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading economic and policy models as context-bound instruments.
- As a **conceptual pivot** when teaching methodology: separates justification from application and highlights external validity.
