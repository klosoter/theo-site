### TITLE
**Biblical Doctrines** - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Princeton theology (published 1929; essays and lectures collected).
 - Reaction to liberal theology, naturalism, and historicist reductions of doctrine; defense of classical Reformed orthodoxy with rigorous historical and exegetical method.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christian doctrine must be reconstructed from and submitted to the authoritative, supernatural revelation of Scripture; theology is both biblical and systematic, defending supernatural Christianity against modern denial.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents a sequence of doctrinal essays moving from revelation and Scripture to God, Christ, Spirit, sin, redemption, and eschatology.
 - Methodological moves:
 - Affirm the plenary inspiration and sufficiency of Scripture.
 - Read doctrine through careful exegesis informed by patristic and Reformation sources.
 - Reject speculative metaphysics that departs from biblical witness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Affirms and draws on Augustine, Calvin, Charles Hodge; engages critics like Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Baur, Wellhausen and modernist currents.
 - Princeton colleagues and the confessional Reformed tradition are constant interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (inspiration, authority).
 - The Trinity (ontological/economic distinctions), Christology, Spirit.
 - Sin and original sin (including the counterfactual "What If Adam Had Not Sinned?").
 - Election, atonement, sacraments, eschatology (e.g., Antichrist/Man of Lawlessness; Romans 11 and Israel).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers theology on the **Scriptural, supernatural self‑revelation of God**, arguing that orthodox doctrine coheres only when rooted in the Bible's witness and defended by careful historical-exegetical argument.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A robust defense of the **supernatural character** of biblical revelation against liberal reductions; meticulous exegetical support for dogmatic claims.
 - Balances confessional Reformed commitments with critical-historical scholarship when it serves Scripture's authority.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Schleiermacheran subjectivism (religion as feeling) and Ritschlian moralism by reasserting propositional revelation and redemptive-history.
 - Pushes back against speculative metaphysical theology that divorces doctrine from Scripture.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Reclaims classical categories (election, imputation, covenant) with renewed exegetical grounding rather than purely systematic abstraction.
 - Clear distinction between the economic and ontological descriptions of the Trinity while refusing subordinationist distortions.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical seminaries; formative in the antithetical stance toward 20th‑century liberalism.
 - Praised for clarity and rigor; critiqued by some later theologians for perceived rigidity and insufficient engagement with social/ethical theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model of how to combine historical theology, biblical exegesis, and dogmatic precision; valuable for teaching doctrine, apologetics, and conservative biblical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Plenary inspiration** - Scripture's full and authoritative divine origin; Warfield's anchor for all doctrine.
- **Supernatural revelation** - God's disclosure in history; contrasted with natural religion and modern reductionism.
- **Ontological Trinity vs Economic Trinity** - Distinguishes God's inner life (ontological) from God's self‑manifestation in history (economic); Warfield insists on both distinctions while upholding divine unity and against subordinationism.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer (of Adam's guilt, of Christ's righteousness) central to Warfield's soteriology.
- **Original sin** - Total inherited corruption from Adam; engaged analytically in the famous counterfactual essay **"What If Adam Had Not Sinned?"** - Warfield explores divine decree, contingency, and the intelligibility of redemption in light of this hypothesis.
- **Romans 11 / Israel's future** - Warfield treats Romans 11 as affirming corporate election and a future, covenantal role for Israel within God's redemptive plan, emphasizing continuity with the church while resisting loosened typological readings.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness** - Eschatological opponent: Warfield reads New Testament warnings as indicating a real future antagonism to Christ and gospel authority, handled eschatologically with caution against sensational speculation.
- **Covenant theology** - Uses covenantal categories to frame election, promise, and sacramental life in continuity with Reformed tradition.
- **Atonement (substitutionary)** - Forensic, penal substitution affirmed as scriptural center of redemption.
- **Authority of creeds** - Confessions and creeds used as faithful summaries subordinate to Scripture, not as independent standards.
- **Historical-critical method (qualified)** - Employs critical tools insofar as they serve the biblical testimony; rejects critical conclusions that undermine supernatural revelation.
- **Use of patristic and Reformation sources** - Frequently appeals to Augustine and Calvin to show doctrinal continuity and canonical reading.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed formulations of inspiration, sin, and atonement. 
- As a **polemic resource** against liberal theology and naturalistic reductions of revelation. 
- As an **exegetical model** for reading doctrinal texts (examples: Romans 11, Thessalonian eschatology) with theological precision.
