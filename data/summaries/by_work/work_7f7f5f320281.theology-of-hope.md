### TITLE
**Theology of Hope** (Theologie der Hoffnung) 
Jurgen Moltmann, 1964 (German), 1967 (English). Programmatic statement of eschatology as the structuring principle of Christian doctrine and praxis.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar Germany; Cold War, decolonization, European reconstruction.
 - Emerges from post-Barthian dialectical theology and the biblical theology movement.
 - In dialogue with Marxist critical theory and Ernst Bloch's The Principle of Hope; against existentialist reductions (Bultmann) and realized eschatology (Dodd).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Christian theology is essentially eschatological**: the God who promises is the God who comes.
 - The **resurrection of the crucified** grounds a future-oriented hope that reconfigures revelation, church, mission, and ethics; theology must be written from the future of God toward the present.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Revelation as promise**: God's self-disclosure has a promissory form that opens history toward fulfillment; Scripture is read through promise-prophecy-fulfillment without closure.
 - **Hope and history**: Hope does not evade history but **creates history**, generating critical-transcending praxis against the given order.
 - **Resurrection as prolepsis**: Easter is the anticipatory realization (prolepsis) of the promised future; it guarantees yet also relativizes present orders.
 - **Eschatology as the first principle**: Eschatology is not a terminal chapter but the framework for all loci (revelation, Christology, soteriology, ecclesiology).
 - **Church and mission**: The church is an **exodus community**, living as sign, foretaste, and instrument of the coming kingdom; sacraments function as anticipatory signs.
 - **Critique of alternatives**: Rejects quietist otherworldliness, secular utopianism, and theological timelessness that neutralize the future of God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture (Exodus, prophets, resurrection narratives; Pauline hope).
 - Dialogues with **Ernst Bloch** (utopia/hope), **Marx** (praxis/critique), **Barth** (revelation), **Pannenberg** (history/revelation), **Bultmann** (demythologizing), **Dodd** (realized eschatology), **Cullmann** and **von Rad** (salvation-history and promise).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology / revelation**: promissory Word; forward-pointing hermeneutic.
 - **Christology**: resurrection of the crucified as eschatological event.
 - **Soteriology**: justification and liberation oriented to future; faith as hope.
 - **Pneumatology**: Spirit as arrabon (pledge) of the future.
 - **Eschatology**: future of God, kingdom, new creation, resurrection of the dead.
 - **Ecclesiology & sacraments**: church as sign and instrument; Eucharist/Baptism as proleptic acts.
 - **Covenant**: promise to Abraham as paradigm of God's future-making word.
- **Center of gravity**
 - **God's promissory future, attested in the resurrection, summons the church into anticipatory participation in the coming kingdom.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Promissory structure of revelation**; **future of God** as theological horizon.
 - **Prolepsis** and **anticipatory praxis** as categories for church, ethics, and worship.
 - Re-reading Exod 3:14 as dynamic identity: I will be who I will be.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **realized eschatology** (Dodd): insists on genuine futurity.
 - Against **existential demythologizing** (Bultmann): maintains public, historical, communal scope of hope.
 - Against **secular utopianism**: grounds transformation in resurrection promise, not progress myths.
 - Against **ahistorical metaphysics**: resists timeless divine immobility; God is faithful in history toward promised future.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Eschatology as method** for all loci; **prolepsis**; **eschatological hermeneutic**; **exodus church**; **anticipatory signs**; **open history** under promise.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalytic for **political theology**, **liberation**, black and feminist theologies; influenced ecumenical mission theology.
 - In Reformed circles: welcomed for re-centering promise and kingdom; critiqued for tendencies toward historicizing God, political overreach, and ambiguities on universalism and classical attributes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Reinvigorates eschatology as constructive engine; energizes sacramental and missional practice as **foretaste**; provides a critical-theological alternative to both quietism and secular progressivism.
