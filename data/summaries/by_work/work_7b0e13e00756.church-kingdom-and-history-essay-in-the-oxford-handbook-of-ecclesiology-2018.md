### TITLE
Church, Kingdom, and History - Peter J. Leithart (essay in The Oxford Handbook of Ecclesiology, 2018)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 2010s resurgence of systematic ecclesiology within Protestant scholarship; conversation with narrative, postliberal, and public theology streams. Oxford Handbook collects state-of-the-art essays; Leithart writes from a confessional, post-Reformed perspective attentive to liturgy, polity, and political theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - The **church is the concrete manifestation and instrument of the kingdom of God in history**: ecclesial identity, sacramental life, and ordered polity are the means by which the kingdom is both proclaimed and enacted in worldly history under Christ the King.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose modern bifurcations: private faith vs. public life, church vs. state, and desacralized history.
 - Reconstruct biblical vision: history as covenantal drama governed by Christ's kingship; church as covenantal, liturgical, and political body that participates in kingdom-making.
 - Exegetical support from scriptural narrative (creation-fall-redemption-eschaton) and Christology (incarnation, enthronement).
 - Practical implications: ecclesial liturgy and sacraments form a polity that reorders social life; Christian engagement with history is transformative, not merely contemplative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Scripture and classical theologians (Augustine, Calvin) as interpretive resources.
 - Engages modern interlocutors implicitly or explicitly: proponents of two-kingdom theology, secular historiography, and some liberationist and liberal accounts that separate church from polity.
 - Dialogues with contemporary ecclesiologies emphasizing either privatized spirituality or radical social critique.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology, kingdom/eschatology, Christology (Christ as King), covenant theology, sacramentology, political theology, providence and history.
- **Closing line**
 - The church is neither a mere worshiping enclave nor a spectator of history; as Christ's crowned body it is the kingdom's instrument to reforge history toward the eschatological telos.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong integration of **kingdom and church**: the church is not simply a sign but an active agent of kingly rule in history.
 - Emphasis on **liturgical and sacramental formation** as the primary means by which the kingdom reshapes persons and polis.
 - Treats history as **covenantal drama**-not neutral process-so ecclesial action has theological causality.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques **two-kingdom** approaches that confine God's rule to the ecclesial/spiritual realm and privatize faith.
 - Pushes back against secular historians and liberal theology that secularize the gospel's political implications.
 - Distances from reductionist social-gospel models that ignore the formative and sacramental life of the church.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Framing of the church as a **kingly polis** whose internal ordering (liturgy, sacraments, offices) is itself a political grammar for reshaping society.
 - Treats ecclesial practices as **historically efficacious**, not merely symbolic.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Resonates with ecclesiologists who seek robust public theology and sacramental ecclesial life (post-Reformed, paleo-orthodox circles).
 - Provokes critique from defenders of church/state distinctions and from those wary of ecclesial claims to political authority.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compressed, theologically integrated model tying worship, doctrine, and social engagement-valuable for courses on ecclesiology, political theology, and sacramental formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Understood as both present and eschatological; realized in Christ and mediated by the church.
- **Church as kingdom-instrument**
 - Church is the concrete agent that manifests royal rule in history.
- **History / covenantal history**
 - History is a providential, covenantal drama directed toward Christ's telos.
- **Christ as King**
 - Central Christological category: his enthronement grounds the church's political and ecclesial mission.
- **Sacrament / liturgy**
 - Primary formative practices that instantiate the kingdom and reorder persons and polis.
- **Polity / ecclesial ordering**
 - Church offices, discipline, and public worship constitute a political grammar for Christian society.
- **Realized eschatology**
 - Kingdom is already present in Christ and the church, yet awaiting consummation.
- **Two-kingdom critique**
 - Rejection of strict spiritual/civil dualism; insists on kingdom permeation of worldly life.
- **Narrative theology**
 - Uses biblical storyline (creation-fall-redemption-consummation) as hermeneutical frame for history and church.
- **Public/political theology**
 - Church's vocation includes public, reforming engagement with social structures.
- **Providence**
 - God's governance of history empowers ecclesial action to have real historical effects.
- **Formation**
 - Liturgical and sacramental practices form Christian identity for kingdom work.
- **Signs vs instruments**
 - Church is both sign of the kingdom and an instrument that effects divine reign.
- **Telos / eschaton**
 - All ecclesial action is teleologically oriented toward consummation in Christ.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for locating the church within the kingdom narrative (ecclesiology/eschatology interface).
 - As a **polemic** against privatizing and two-kingdom theologies; also used to critique secular historiography.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating liturgy, sacraments, and political theology in teaching and church formation.
