### TITLE
Simply God - Peter Sanlon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary theological engagement that sits at the intersection of classical theism, Reformed retrieval, and analytic philosophy of religion. Aimed at correcting modern departures from classical formulations of God's being while dialoguing with recent philosophical objections.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The identity of God as metaphysically simple must be recovered and rearticulated so that biblical Trinitarian faith, Christology, and divine attributes are coherently sustained against modern fragmentation (anthropomorphism, process-relational alternatives, and nominalistic reconstructions).

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - exegetical move: reads Scripture for a consistent biblical witness to God's unity and the non-composite character of divine being; emphasizes texts that describe God's essence and oneness. 
 - philosophical move: defends the classical doctrine of divine simplicity (existence and essence identical; no metaphysical composition) against common contemporary objections. 
 - doctrinal move: shows how simplicity secures doctrines - attributes, aseity, immutability, providence - and how it must be qualified so as not to collapse Trinitarian personhood into modalism. 
 - pastoral/doctrinal implications: connects metaphysical recovery to worship, prayer, and Christian life - a "simple" God is also a God of reliable covenant and personal relation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - classical witnesses: Augustine, Aquinas, key Reformation and Puritan sources for doctrinal precedent. 
 - contemporary interlocutors: recent analytic philosophers and theologians who critique or revise divine simplicity and those proposing process/open models; engages technical metaphysics but keeps theological priorities explicit.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Divine simplicity (central), Trinity (ontological and economic distinction), attributes of God, aseity, immutability, impassibility, revelation and biblical language about God, implications for providence and Christology.

- **Closing line:** 
 Recovering a carefully qualified classical divine simplicity provides the metaphysical backbone for orthodox Trinitarian faith and preserves the coherence of God's attributes with biblical revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence that divine simplicity is not an abstruse scholastic relic but a necessary safeguard for biblical monotheism and Christology. 
 - Clarifies common confusions by distinguishing metaphysical simplicity from epistemic or linguistic simplicity (how we speak of God vs who God is).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Corrects neo-classical and process proposals that relativize or reject simplicity by showing the doctrinal costs (e.g., loss of true aseity or blurred divine immutability). 
 - Pushes back on crude appropriations of classical doctrine that slip into modalism; insists on relational personhood within an ontologically simple God.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Refines the language connecting essence-existence identity to Trinitarian personhood so the doctrine resists reduction to mere impersonal monism. 
 - Offers practical hermeneutic rules for reading biblical anthropomorphisms in light of metaphysical simplicity.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Valued in circles seeking Reformed retrieval of classical theism and among teachers who want a bridge between biblical theology and analytic metaphysics. 
 - Serves as a corrective resource against popular theological trends that undercut classical attributes.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clear, surveyable defense of a contested doctrine that is usable in seminary courses on doctrine of God. 
 - Helpful for training students to move between Scripture, historical theology, and contemporary philosophical critique without capitulating to either naïve literalism or abstract metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God is not composed of parts; God's essence = existence. Sanlon treats this as the keystone for other attributes. 
- **Essence-Existence Identity:** The claim that in God there is no real distinction between what God is and that God is; used to support aseity and necessity. 
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; follows from simplicity and secures theological independence. 
- **Immutability:** God does not change; discussed as consistent with personal relation and covenantal action. 
- **Impassibility:** God is not passively affected by creatures; clarified to avoid making God remote. 
- **Attributes of God (communicable/ incommunicable):** Treated through the lens of simplicity so that attributes do not imply composition. 
- **Trinity - ontological vs. economic distinction:** Emphasizes maintaining personhood within ontological unity; prevents modalism while affirming relationality. 
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling):** Employed to explain intra‑Trinitarian relations without ontological division. 
- **Analogy of Being (analogia entis):** Used cautiously to bridge human language about God with divine simplicity. 
- **Anthropomorphism:** Scriptural language about God retraced carefully so as not to undermine metaphysical claims. 
- **Necessity & Contingency:** Divine necessity grounded by simplicity; creaturely contingency left distinct. 
- **Ontological Composition:** Critiqued as category mistake when applied to God. 
- **Economy-Ontology Hermeneutic:** Rule for reading redemptive history without collapsing persons into modes. 
- **Revelational Primacy:** Scripture sets boundaries for metaphysical claims; metaphysics serves exegetical clarity, not the reverse.

- How the work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for classical theism in dogmatics courses (doctrine of God). 
 - As a **polemic** resource against open/process theologies and reductionist accounts of divine attributes. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical language about God in concert with historical metaphysics. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking metaphysical doctrine to pastoral and liturgical concerns (worship, prayer, assurance).
