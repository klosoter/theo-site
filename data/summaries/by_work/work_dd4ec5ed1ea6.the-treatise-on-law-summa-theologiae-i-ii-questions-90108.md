### TITLE
The Treatise on Law (Summa Theologiae I-II, Qs. 90-108) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed c. 1265-1274 within medieval scholasticism. Aquinas synthesizes Aristotelian natural philosophy, Augustinian theology, canonical jurisprudence, and the emerging University curriculum.
 - Written for systematic moral theology: placed in the Prima Secundae (I-II) of the Summa Theologiae, addressing human action, moral virtue, and governance.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Law is the rational ordinance for the common good, promulgated by one who has care of the community; its rightness depends on participation in the Eternal Law. The treatise articulates types of law and locates the New Law (Gospel) within the economy of grace rather than as simple negation of the Old Law.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definitions and general properties (Qs. 90-97): law defined, requirements (reason, common good, promulgation, authority), relation to justice and coercion.
 - Species of law (Qs. 91-105): Eternal Law (God's providential reason); Natural Law (participation of rational creatures); Human Law (derivative ordinances for particular communities); Divine Law (positive revelation - Old and New Law).
 - Effects and limits (Qs. 99-108): law's role in forming conscience, enabling virtue, distinguishing just from unjust laws, law's penal and remedial functions, and the New Law as interior, grace-giving, and ordered to charity.
 - Recurrent move: metaphysical grounding (participation) → moral/ethical consequences → juridical-pastoral implications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary sources: Scripture (especially Pauline texts), Augustine, Aristotle (Nicomachean Ethics and Politics), Gratian/canonical tradition.
 - Implicit interlocutors: legalists/rigorists, Pelagian tendencies (overconfidence in human law), and pastoral concerns about conscience and governance.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Divine/positive law), covenantal ordering implicit in Old/New Law, anthropology (reason and will), virtue ethics (especially charity), grace (role of the New Law), political theology (law, authority, and common good).

- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas centers law as a rational, teleological ordering rooted in God's Eternal Law whose fulfillment is not abolition but inward perfection in the New Law of grace and charity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Law as participation in the Eternal Law: normative authority grounded metaphysically, not merely procedurally.
 - The New Law is primarily interior (grace and charity) while retaining exterior precepts when necessary - law perfected, not revoked.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Clarifies and systematizes Augustinian intuitions about grace vs. law with Aristotelian categories (teleology, natural law).
 - Distinguishes clearly between coercive function of human law and formative function of divine/New Law.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Synderesis (habitual principle of moral knowledge) and the layered taxonomy of law (eternal → natural → human → divine/positive) used as hermeneutical engine.
 - Emphasis on promulgation and common good as constitutive of valid law.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central to Catholic natural law tradition and magisterial teaching; has shaped casuistry, canon law, and Catholic moral theology.
 - Reformed and Protestant traditions have selectively used Aquinas (esp. natural law categories) but often critique his sacramental/communal positioning of the New Law and his metaphysical participation model.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable conceptual framework for law/gospel interface: avoids antinomian extremes and legalism by integrating moral ontology, virtue formation, and pastoral concern.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Law**
 - God's providential reason ordering all things; source of other laws.

- **Natural Law**
 - Participation of rational creatures in Eternal Law; basic precepts (e.g., do good, avoid evil).

- **Human Law**
 - Derived ordinances for particular communities; valid insofar as they conform to natural law and the common good.

- **Divine / Positive Law**
 - Revealed law (Scripture): subdivided into Old Law (Mosaic) and New Law (Gospel).

- **Old Law**
 - Exterior precepts, ceremonial and moral elements; pedagogue to Christ (cf. Galatians).

- **New Law (Evangelical Law)**
 - Interior law of grace and charity; perfects natural law and enables supernatural ends.

- **Synderesis**
 - Innate habit inclining the mind to first moral principles; foundation for conscience.

- **Conscience (Conscientia)**
 - Application of general moral knowledge to particular acts; must be informed by right law and grace.

- **Promulgation**
 - Requirement that law be made known to subjects to be binding.

- **Common Good**
 - Telos of law and measure of its legitimacy.

- **Justice**
 - Virtue aligning will to law and right order; law as instrument for cultivating justice.

- **Unjust Law**
 - A human ordinance contrary to natural law; does not bind in conscience but may be obeyed externally for peace.

- **Law's End**
 - Formation of virtue (ultimate end) vs. external order and punishment (medial ends).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a primary definition source for natural law theory and the taxonomy of law in moral and political theology.
- As a polemical and pastoral resource against antinomianism and legalism: models relation of law and Gospel.
- As an exegetical model for interpreting Old and New Law: Old Law as pedagogue, New Law as interior sanctification.
- As a conceptual pivot in ethics and ecclesial law for adjudicating legitimacy of human/positive laws.
