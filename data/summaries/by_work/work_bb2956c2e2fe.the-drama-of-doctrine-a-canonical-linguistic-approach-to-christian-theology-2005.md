### TITLE
**Kevin J. Vanhoozer, The Drama of Doctrine: A Canonical-Linguistic Approach to Christian Theology (2005)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / milieu**
 - Early 2000s post-foundational evangelical theology amid postliberal, postmodern hermeneutics debates.
 - Retrieval of catholic-Reformed resources with analytic philosophy of language and theological interpretation of Scripture.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Doctrine directs the churchs fitting performance of the gospel**: Scripture, as canon, functions like an authoritative script; theology equips the church to participate wisely in the triune **theodrama**.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Triune communicative action**: God speaks and acts; revelation is covenantal discourse culminating in Christ, authored by the Father, communicated by the Spirit.
 - **Speech-act account of Scripture**: Biblical texts as communicative acts (locution, illocution, perlocution); **canonicity** stabilizes divine illocutions for the church.
 - **Canonical-linguistic method**: The canon gives the church its rule of faith and language; doctrine is the **improvisational wisdom** that renders the rule actionable in new situations.
 - **Performance hermeneutics**: Interpretation aims at right performance; ecclesial judgment discerns what is **fitting** to the gospel across the dramas acts.
 - **Ecclesial roles**: Pastors as directors, theologians as dramaturgs; catechesis forms virtuous actors.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Balthasars theo-drama, Childs canonical criticism, Wittgenstein, Austin/Searle (speech-acts), Gadamer/Ricoeur, Barth on divine self-attestation, MacIntyre on practices/virtue.
 - In debate: Lindbecks cultural-linguistic model, Frei on narrative, Derrida and Fish on interpretive communities, revisionist correlational theologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general and special), **Scripture** and its authority, canon and interpretation, **Trinity** (as communicative agency), ecclesiology and mission, sanctification and **human psychosomatic unity** as embodied performance, method and **principia** of theology, epistemology and the knowledge of God.
- **Line of force**
 - The center of gravity: **From canon to communion to conduct** under the reign of the speaking God, so that the church participates wisely in Christ by the Spirit to the glory of the Father.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframing doctrine as **direction for action** rather than mere propositions or experience.
 - **Canonical-linguistic** synthesis: Scripture as normative discourse plus ecclesial practices for faithful speech and act.
 - **Improvisation under authority**: freedom constrained by canonical fittingness across the one drama with multiple acts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Beyond **postliberalism**: not only community grammar, but **canonical** divine discourse with authorial intentions.
 - Against **biblicism** and **solo scriptura**: retrieval of **sola scriptura** with tradition as performance history under Scripture.
 - Mediates **analogia fidei vs analogia entis**: hermeneutically analogia fidei; ontologically a chastened realism of participation in triune communication.
 - Recasts inerrancy as **illocutionary trustworthiness** rather than errorlessness at every level.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - **Theodrama**, **canonical sensus literalis**, **triune speech-act** mapping, **performance criticism** as ecclesial discernment, doctrine as **stage directions**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed-evangelical seminaries; key text for the **theological interpretation of Scripture** movement.
 - Critiques note potential subjectivism in improvisation; supporters commend its ecclesial practicality and catholic breadth.
- **Enduring value**
 - A robust account of **theological method** integrating bibliology, hermeneutics, and ecclesial praxis; equips pastors and scholars to hold together truth, wisdom, and mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Theodrama**: Redemptive history as divine-human drama; sets the mode for doctrine and ethics.
- **Canonical-linguistic**: Scripture as normative canon and the churchs language-practice shaping faithful understanding and action.
- **Speech act** (locution, illocution, perlocution): Framework for Scripture as communicative action; grounds authority in divine illocutions.
- **Triune communicative action**: The Father speaks, the Son is the content and mediator, the Spirit effects reception and performance.
- **Doctrine as direction**: Dogma provides stage directions that enable fitting participation, not merely abstract truths.
- **Canon as script**: The Bible authorizes and constrains the churchs performance across new settings.
- **Improvisation** and **fittingness**: Prudential application within canonical constraints; requires virtue and phronesis.
- **Canonical sensus literalis**: Literal sense located at the level of the final canon with its intertextual unity in Christ.
- **Self-attestation of Scripture**: The canon bears divine authority intrinsically, recognized by the Spirits witness in the church.
 - Distinguish sola scriptura from solo scriptura; tradition as subordinate performance history.
- **General and special revelation**: Creation and providence as theater of glory; Scripture as redemptive address clarifying and correcting creaturely knowledge of God.
- **Analogia fidei vs analogia entis**: Scripture-interprets-Scripture for theology; cautious realism about created participation in divine communicative action.
- **Biblical theology vs systematic theology**: Integration via canonical reasoning; BT supplies acts and scenes, ST supplies directions for contemporary performance.
- **Principia of theology**: Principium essendi in God; principium cognoscendi externum in Scripture, internum in the Spirits illumination; theology as a disciplined science of divine discourse.
- **Psychosomatic unity**: Human agents as embodied speakers-actors; sanctification entails bodily practices shaped by the canon.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **methodological template** in bibliology and hermeneutics, especially on authority and interpretation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for ethics and ecclesiology via performance and improvisation.
 - As a **polemic and mediation** in debates on inerrancy, self-attestation, and analogia entis vs fidei.
 - As an **exegetical model** employing speech-act and canonical sensus literalis across loci.
