### TITLE
Against Eunomius (Contra Eunomium) - Basil of Caesarea

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-4th century Cappadocia (c. 364-372). Polemic written in the aftermath of the Nicene controversy against the radical Arian school led by Eunomius of Cyzicus. Part of the broader Cappadocian defense and clarification of Nicene theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to refute Eunomius's claim that the divine essence is fully knowable by definition and that the Son is unlike the Father in essence (anomoios); to defend the Son's **eternal generation** and the Spirit's **eternal spiration** while maintaining divine simplicity and consubstantiality (homoousios).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Epistemological critique: Eunomius posits that God's essence can be captured by a single defining concept (the "good" or "self-subsistent"), making divine predicates univocal and enabling knowledge of God's essence as such. Basil counters that knowledge of God is mediated by effects and revelation, not by speculative definitions.
 - Ontological correction: Eunomius' method collapses relations into essence and treats the Son as a created or derivative being. Basil insists on **real relational distinctions** (generation and procession) that do not divide or diminish the single divine essence.
 - Trinitarian account: Basil develops the language of **ousia** (essence) vs. **hypostasis** (person) to safeguard both unity and plurality. He affirms eternal generation of the Son and eternal procession (spiration) of the Spirit as real, eternal relations within the one God.
 - Apophatic move: emphasizes divine ineffability and the limits of human conceptualization; critiques Eunomius' overconfident rationalism.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Eunomius (primary interlocutor); broader Arian factions; supportive Cappadocians (Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen); Scripture (especially Johannine and Pauline material), patristic vocabulary and philosophical grammar (ousia/hypostasis).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (central), Eternal Generation, Spiration (procession of the Spirit), Revelation/Knowledge of God, Divine Simplicity, Christology insofar as the Son's status is defended.
- **Closing line:** Basil aims to preserve a Trinitarian balance: the Father, Son, and Spirit are truly distinct in eternal relations (generation and spiration) while sharing one simple, ineffable divine essence accessible only through revelation and relational predication.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong apophatic restraint combined with robust relational ontology: Basil denies speculative capture of God's essence while affirming eternal interpersonal relations among the Persons.
 - Clear operational distinction between **knowing God by effects** and claiming direct epistemic access to divine essence.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct rebuttal of Eunomius' univocal approach and denial of the Son's eternal Sonship; correction of any tendency to construe generation as temporal or created.
 - Clarifies and systematizes Nicene vocabulary against both Arian dilution and Eunomian hyper-definition.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rigorous deployment of **ousia/hypostasis** language to ground a metaphysics of persons without dividing substance.
 - Emphasis on **relation** as ontologically real but non-substantializing (relations do not create multiple gods).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Foundational for Eastern Orthodox trinitarian theology, especially on eternal generation and the Spirit's procession from the Father (not the Filioque).
 - Influenced Western theologians via the Cappadocians broadly; served as a corrective to Arian and rationalistic readings of divine being.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models a disciplined interplay of biblical exegesis, philosophical precision, and apophatic humility.
 - Remains a primary source for debates over eternal generation, procession, and the limits of theological language.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eunomianism:** Doctrine that asserts complete knowability of God's essence and defines God by a single concept; Basil's principal antagonist.
- **Eternal Generation:** The Son's eternal begetting by the Father; real relational distinction without temporal origination or creation.
- **Spiration (Procession):** The Spirit's eternal origin from the Father (Basil defends procession from the Father; Cappadocians articulate spiration distinct from creation).
- **Ousia:** Divine essence/substance; emphasized as one, simple, and ineffable.
- **Hypostasis:** Personal reality/person; used by Basil to distinguish Father, Son, and Spirit while affirming one ousia.
- **Homoousios:** "Consubstantial" - the Nicene formula affirmed and defended against Eunomian denial.
- **Apophaticism:** The methodological claim that God transcends positive human definitions; Basil weds this to affirmative relational claims.
- **Relation (relatio):** Real, eternal relations (begetting, procession) that constitute personal distinctions without dividing essence.
- **Monarchy of the Father:** The ordering principle (source) within the Trinity affirmed by Basil while denying inequality of essence.
- **Ineffability:** The limit to human predicates for God; used to repudiate Eunomius' epistemic confidence.
- **Economy (oikonomia):** The salvific and revelatory actions of God by which human knowledge of the Trinity is mediated.
- **Anomoios / Homoiousios (contrast):** Eunomius' claim of unlike-ness (anomoios) is rejected in favor of homoousios.
- **Consistent use of Scripture:** Basil appeals to biblical testimony (e.g., Father-Son language in John) as normative for tracing relations.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for eternal generation and Cappadocian formulations of relation and person.
- As a **polemic model** against rationalist or reductionist accounts of God's essence (useful in anti-Arian and contemporary critiques).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Johannine and Trinitarian passages through relational categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in Trinitarian ontology: balancing divine simplicity, relationality, and theological apophaticism.
