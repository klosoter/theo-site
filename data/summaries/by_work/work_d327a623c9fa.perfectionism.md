### TITLE
Perfectionism - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century American Reformed evangelical milieu; Warfield at Princeton Seminary reacting to contemporary holiness movements (Wesleyan "entire sanctification" and the Keswick "higher life" tradition).
 - Published as part of Warfield's essays/lectures addressing doctrinal controversies about sanctification and the Christian life.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Warfield argues that "perfectionism" (claims of present, sinless perfection or eradication of indwelling sin in this life) is theologically untenable and pastorally dangerous; true Christian sanctification is progressive, Spirit-wrought, and eschatological in its consummation.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys varieties of perfectionist claims (Wesleyan instantaneous eradication; Keswick-style crisis consecration that promises victory over sin).
 - Exegetical-theological rebuttal: marshals biblical texts, the Reformed doctrine of total depravity, and doctrines of union with Christ to show continuation of indwelling sin and the need for lifelong mortification.
 - Doctrinal distinction: insists on a firm separation between forensic justification and ethical sanctification; denies that mystical experiences or crisis gifts annul the need for progressive sanctification.
 - Practical-pastoral conclusion: urges humility, perseverance, and reliance on ordinary means (Word, Spirit, sacraments) rather than expectation of a sinless state or perfectionist assurance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary opponents: Wesleyan holiness theologians and Keswick movement leaders; Warfield also dialogues with earlier Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed writers (Augustine, Calvinian tradition) in defense of classic Reformed doctrine.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification (nature, course, and limits), justification (forensic character), sin (believers' remaining corruption), Spirit and spiritual gifts (role in holiness), covenant theology (works vs. grace), good works and their status.
 - Specific topical intersections cited here: **Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification** (role of gifts and crises in sanctification) and **Good Works And Merit In The Covenant Of Grace** (status of works vis-a-vis covenantal standing).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the controversy on the claim that sanctification is a progressive, Spirit-wrought transformation that will be perfected eschatologically, not an achieved, absolute eradication of sin in this life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Rigorous defense of the Reformed distinction between positional (justification, union with Christ) realities and progressive ethical transformation; refuses to collapse forensic status into present moral perfection.
 - Emphasis on the permanence of indwelling corruption until glorification-sanctification as growth in holiness, not instantaneous depravation-removal.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Direct correction of Wesleyan "entire sanctification" and Keswick crisis theology: Warfield denies that a single sanctifying crisis or surrender guarantees absolute conquest of sin.
 - Rejects both Pelagian optimism and mystical triumphalism; situates victory in perseverance and ordinary means rather than momentary experiences.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens the language of "perfection" into theological categories: ethical/experiential perfection (denied as present), positional perfection in Christ (affirmed as declared), and eschatological perfection (promised).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a standard Reformed critique of holiness/perfectionist movements; influential among conservative Reformed and evangelical scholars defending progressive sanctification and forensic justification.
 - Criticized by holiness and some charismatic writers who affirm instantaneous or crisis sanctification experiences.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful theological discrimination between experiential claims and doctrinal categories; valuable for pastors and teachers in counseling, sacramental practice, and debates over spiritual gifts and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perfectionism**
 - Broad label for doctrines asserting present moral or spiritual sinless perfection; Warfield distinguishes types and refutes their claims.
- **Entire Sanctification**
 - Wesleyan term for instantaneous eradication of original sin; treated as the chief target of Warfield's critique.
- **Keswick "Higher Life" / Crisis Experience**
 - Notion that a crisis consecration or filling with the Spirit yields a new plane of holiness; Warfield allows benefit of spiritual renewal but denies eradication of indwelling sin.
- **Justification vs Sanctification**
 - **Justification**: forensic, once-for-all declaration (positional perfection in Christ).
 - **Sanctification**: progressive, moral transformation (ethical/perfective work continued until glorification).
- **Progressive Sanctification**
 - The ongoing work of the Spirit producing holiness over the believer's life; central Warfield affirmation.
- **Eschatological Perfection**
 - Final consummation of sanctification at glorification; Warfield insists this is where true perfection belongs.
- **Spiritual Gifts**
 - Instruments for edification and growth; gifts do not guarantee eradication of sin but contribute to sanctification when exercised in the covenant community.
- **Good Works**
 - Fruit and evidence of faith; necessary within the covenant life but not meritorious for acceptance before God.
- **Merit (in the Covenant of Grace)**
 - Warfield rejects any intrinsic human merit in covenantal terms; good works have covenantal place as obedient fruit, not as ground of justification.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Positional ground of believers' acceptance and the source of hope for ultimate perfection.
- **Mortification and Vivification**
 - Continual Christian disciplines: dying to sin and living in the Spirit; Warfield emphasizes both as ongoing.
- **Assurance**
 - Properly grounded in Christ's work and promise, not in attainment of sinless state.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a definitional and critical resource on sanctification and perfection doctrines.
 - As polemic material against Wesleyan/Keswick perfectionism and for distinguishing forensic justification from ethical sanctification.
 - As an exegetical model for reading sanctification texts with Reformed covenantal and union-with-Christ categories.
