### TITLE
**Tampering with the Trinity: Does the Son Submit to His Father?** - Bruce A. Ware (Journal for Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early-2000s complementarian-egalitarian controversies about gender and theological anthropology.
 - Published in a movement journal committed to complementarianism; part of a widening debate about whether intra-Trinitarian relations can ground human gender roles.
 - The article enters a growing literature (Grudem, Ware, et al.) defending an **eternal functional subordination** (EFS) model against critics who say this distorts orthodox Trinitarian doctrine.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ware argues that the Son eternally submits to the Father in **relation and role** (authority-submission) while remaining ontologically equal; this *does not* constitute ontological subordination and is compatible with historic orthodoxy.
 - The doctrine has direct implications for the theological justification of male headship in marriage and church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis: surveys New Testament texts (notably John, Philippians, synoptic hints) to show patterns of Son's submission and Father's authority in both economy and, Ware contends, eternally.
 - Theological distinction: insists on a firm dividing line between **ontological equality (being)** and **functional ordering (relation/role)**.
 - Historical-theological defense: argues that recognizing intra-Trinitarian relations of authority does not revive classical subordinationism insofar as ontological equality is preserved.
 - Practical-theological application: links intra-Trinitarian ordering to normative models for male-female relations in marriage and church.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Allies: Wayne Grudem, complementarian interpreters who use the Trinity to ground gender roles.
 - Critics: egalitarian theologians and historians of doctrine who warn that EFS risks subordinationism (e.g., Kevin Giles, other patristic/historical critics).
 - Uses patristic, biblical, and contemporary systematic resources selectively to rebut charges of heterodoxy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent vs. economic), Christology (person and work distinctions), authority and submission, implications for anthropology and ecclesiology.

- **Closing line**
 - Ware locates the article's center of gravity in the claim that **eternal relational order within the Godhead (Son's submission) is both theologically defensible and the proper theological foundation for complementarian practice**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Argues explicitly for *eternal* rather than merely *economic* functional order - a strong, clear statement of EFS as a Trinitarian feature.
 - Reiterates and refines the ontological/functional distinction as a hermeneutical key.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against those who confine submission to the economic Trinity only; contends that such confinement undermines the theological motivation for male headship.
 - Attempts to neutralize the critical charge that EFS collapses into ontological subordination by repeated clarifications.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Advances and normalizes the phrase "eternal functional subordination" within conservative evangelical discourse.
 - Frames intra-Trinitarian relations in terms of **authority and submission** rather than merely procession/origination language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among Reformed/complementarian circles; frequently cited in evangelical defenses of male headship.
 - Provoked sustained critique from egalitarian and many historical-theological scholars who view EFS as theologically risky or revisionist.
 - Catalyzed a robust interdisciplinary debate (biblical exegesis, dogmatics, patristics).

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a concise, polemical statement of the complementarian Trinitarian argument.
 - Serves as a primary reference when tracing the modern EFS debate and its pastoral/ethical ramifications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - The Son's submission to the Father is an eternal relational reality (functional, not ontological).
- **Ontological Equality** - The claim that Father, Son, and Spirit share the same divine being; Ware insists EFS preserves this.
- **Functional Order / Order of Persons** - Distinct relational roles within the Godhead (authority vs. submission) apart from essence.
- **Economic Trinity** - The roles of Father, Son, and Spirit in redemption history; Ware argues economy reflects eternal relations.
- **Immanent Trinity** - The internal life of God; Ware contends relations of authority are part of the immanent Trinity.
- **Subordinationism (historical)** - Classical heresy that denied Son's full divinity; Ware carefully rejects ontological subordination while affirming functional ordering.
- **Authority-Submission Language** - Central categories Ware uses to describe Trinitarian relations and human analogues (marriage/church).
- **Ontological vs. Functional Distinction** - Key analytic move to reconcile EFS with Nicene orthodoxy.
- **Complementarianism** - The theological and ethical framework Ware intends to ground in Trinitarian relations.
- **Analogy of Marriage** - Uses intra-Trinitarian order as a normative analogy for marital roles (wife's submission to husband modeled on Son's submission).
- **Imprecise Critics** - Ware often points to critics who, he says, conflate economic ordering with ontological inferiority.
- **Patristic Appeals** - Selective appeal to church fathers to legitimize relational language without conceding heterodoxy.
- **Scriptural loci** - John 14-17, Philippians 2, Gospels used as primary exegetical anchors.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition and advocacy source** for EFS within modern complementarian theology.
- As a **polemic text** when arguing against egalitarian charges that complementarian Trinitarian appeals are heterodox.
- As an **exegetical-model exemplar** for readings that see intra-Trinitarian authority/submission as both biblical and theologically normative.
