### TITLE
Religious Affections (1746) - Jonathan Edwards

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1746 in the aftermath of the First Great Awakening; Edwards (Congregationalist, New England Puritan-Calvinist) addresses controversies about revival authenticity, enthusiasm, and pastoral discernment.
 - Movement milieu: revivalist fervor (Whitefield et al.), critics charging fanaticism, and intra-Reformed concern for doctrinal order in conversion practice.
- **Central thesis**
 - Genuine religion consists primarily in the transformation of the heart's affections toward God; true conversion is evidenced by rightly ordered, divinely wrought affections rather than mere external behavior or transient sensations.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Defines "affections" (the will, inclinations, emotions, desires) and distinguishes them from intellect and outward acts.
 - Establishes scriptural and experiential warrant that God renews affections in regeneration; surveys observable fruits and signs.
 - Provides rules and tests to discern true from false religious affections.
 - Diagnoses common counterfeits (enthusiasm, hypocrisy, moral externalism) and prescribes pastoral prudence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Interacts implicitly with revival leaders and their critics; draws heavily on Scripture, Puritan pastoral tradition (Owenian themes), and empirical observation of New England revivals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Conversion, regeneration, sanctification, sin (natural depravity), divine sovereignty in salvation, moral responsibility, and pastoral theology of discernment.
 - Implicit Christology and pneumatology insofar as the Spirit effects the change of affections; covenantal context undergirds normative expectations.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: authentic Christianity is the sovereignly wrought, Scripture-conforming reorientation of the soul's affections to God, manifested in holy life and stable spiritual fruit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes the heart's affections the primary criterion for authentic religion, not merely assent or external conformity.
 - Presents a careful pastoral-psychological taxonomy of emotions and motives without reducing theology to psychology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects cold formalism that reduces religion to external observance or intellectual assent.
 - Counters enthusiastic voluntarism and untested emotionalism by supplying doctrinal tests and biblical norms.
 - Offers a Calvinist corrective to Arminian-style moralistic or decisionist accounts of conversion.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Coined/solidified the phrase "religious affections" as a technical category tying affections to evidences of grace.
 - Systematic issuance of "rules" for testing affections blends pastoral theology, experiential criteria, and doctrinal benchmarks.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in American evangelical and Reformed piety; used extensively in revival theology, pastoral formation, and spiritual direction.
 - Adopted by pastors and revival critics alike as a diagnostic instrument; later pietist and evangelical traditions draw on Edwards for affective theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating doctrine, experience, and pastoral discernment; valuable for ministers assessing conversions and for theologians treating the role of emotions in faith.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Affections**
 - Broad term for desires, inclinations, emotions, and the will; the central locus of religious change.
- **True religious affections**
 - Affections that are divinely wrought, Scripture-conforming, lasting, and producing holy fruit.
- **False/counterfeit affections**
 - Emotional displays driven by pride, fear, social contagion, or natural sensibility without God-glorifying orientation.
- **Sovereignty of grace**
 - Emphasis that God must effect the change of affections; human will is moved by God.
- **Regeneration / conversion**
 - The divine act that renews affections, resulting in new loves and desires for God and holiness.
- **Sanctification**
 - The progressive shaping of affections toward greater conformity with Christ; evidence of true conversion.
- **Enthusiasm**
 - A pejorative for unguided emotionalism; Edwards supplies criteria to distinguish true spiritual fervor from delusion.
- **Humiliation**
 - A marked effect of true affections: contrition, brokenness over sin that leads to repentance.
- **Delight in God**
 - Positive sign: a chief feature of true affections is joy and relational delight in God and Christ.
- **Self-denial / mortification**
 - Practical fruit: love of holiness produces willingness to deny self and endure suffering for Christ.
- **Sensible religion**
 - Experiences and sensations of religious feeling; Edwards evaluates these as neither necessary nor sufficient apart from right affections.
- **Moral agency / will**
 - Implicit compatibilist framework: will follows the strongest motive; affections shape choices.
- **Sin and depravity**
 - Affections are corrupted by sin and need sovereign renewal; natural affections cannot produce saving love for God unaided.
- **Discernment rules**
 - Edwards supplies procedural tests (Scripture conformity, fruit, uniformity, endurance) to evaluate affections.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "religious affections" and for experiential criteria of conversion.
 - As a **polemic** against both cold formalism and unchecked enthusiasm.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for assessing revivals, discerning true conversion, and training ministers in spiritual discernment.
