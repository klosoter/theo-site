### TITLE
Disputation with Pyrrhus - Maximus the Confessor (mid‑7th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑7th century, in the aftermath of Chalcedon (451) and amid the Monophysite / Monothelite controversies. Written during Maximus' active polemical period (c. 641-655) as imperial and ecclesial circles pressed for Christological compromise.
 - The disputation addresses a former proponent/representative figure associated with anti‑Chalcedonian positions, here named Pyrrhus, within a charged political‑theological milieu.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend the Chalcedonian affirmation of **two natures united in one Person (hypostatic union)** while rejecting Monophysite conflation and Monothelite reduction (one will / one energy).
 - To show that unity of the Person does not erase the real properties, operations, and wills of each nature.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarify categories: physis (nature) vs. hypostasis/person; assert Chalcedon as normative lexical framework.
 - Distinguish operations (energeiai) and wills as natural properties that follow from each nature; argue that attributing one will collapses natures.
 - Use patristic testimonies (especially Cyril and Leo) to show continuity with earlier orthodoxy and to rebut Pyrrhus' compressive readings.
 - Conclude that Christ's person is single (the Word) but not at the cost of real, non‑confused natures and their corresponding natural properties.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Opponent: Pyrrhus (representing Monophysite/Monothelite tendencies).
 - Patristic authorities: Cyril of Alexandria, Leo the Great (Tome), Gregory Nazianzen, and other Orthodox sources; frequent appeal to Scripture.
 - Implicit audience: bishops and imperial negotiators wrestling with union strategies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Hypostatic Union** (primary), Chalcedonian definition of two natures, Christology (personhood, wills, energies), communicatio idiomatum (communication of properties).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Maximus insists: **one Person (the Word) assumes and preserves two complete natures with their proper operations and wills; unity of person never effaces ontological distinction of natures.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Precise juridical‑metaphysical distinction between nature and person: Maximus stresses ontological priority of hypostatic unity while safeguarding natural properties (energies, wills).
 - Early and influential articulation of the connection between **nature and operation** (what a nature is by virtue of - its proper energies).
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters Monophysite tendency to fuse natures into a single composite nature.
 - Opposes Monothelitism / Monoenergism by arguing that single will/energy logic undermines the Chalcedonian synthesis and Cyril/Leo's exegesis.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic linking of **dyothelitism** (two wills) to Chalcedonian two natures; anticipates later formal definitions.
 - Clarifies communicatio idiomatum: properties are communicable in the person, not absorbed ontologically across natures.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly esteemed in Eastern Orthodox Christology; Maximus' formulations contributed to the final rejection of Monothelitism at the Third Council of Constantinople (681).
 - In Western and Reformed theology his work is cited as a rigorous defense of Chalcedonian distinctions and as a resource on the communicatio idiomatum and the person/nature distinction.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a method: tightly argued metaphysical distinctions constrained by patristic witness and scripture - useful for teaching Chalcedonian orthodoxy and for ecumenical retrieval.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The union of the divine Word with human nature in one hypostasis/person; Maximus insists on personal unity without ontological blending of natures.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine**
 - The creed that Christ exists in **two natures, without confusion, change, division, or separation**; Maximus reads Chalcedon as determinative and defends its logical consequences (e.g., two wills).
- **Physis (nature)**
 - What constitutes the being and proper operations of a thing; human and divine natures retain their own properties in Christ.
- **Hypostasis / Prosopon (person)**
 - The personal subject in whom natures are united; the Word is the single personal subject of both natures.
- **Energeia (operation / energy)**
 - The activity proper to a nature; used to argue that operations reveal underlying nature and cannot be merged without loss.
- **Will (thelema); Dyothelitism**
 - Maximus argues for two natural wills corresponding to two natures; this defends freedom and authenticity of Christ's human will without dividing the person.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The communication of properties: Maximus nuances it so that predicates pass to the person but do not erase ontological distinctions of each nature.
- **Monophysitism / Monothelitism / Monoenergism**
 - Errors opposed in the Disputation: fusion of natures (Monophysitism) and reduction of operations/wills to one (Monothelitism / Monoenergism).
- **Tome of Leo / Cyrillian language**
 - Key patristic sources appealed to for scriptural and theological continuity.
- **Personhood and freedom**
 - Maximus connects Christ's human will and freedom to soteriological and moral implications (real human will healed and assumed).

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for reinforcing Chalcedonian two‑natures doctrine and the logic of dyothelitism.
- As a **polemic** exemplar against Monophysitism and Monothelitism, showing how to marshal patristic proof and metaphysical distinctions.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for teaching communicatio idiomatum, the relation of nature to operation, and the grammar of personhood in Christology.
