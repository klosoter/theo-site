### TITLE
The Sacrifice of Christ and the Sacrament of the Lord's Supper - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th-century Dutch Reformed theology. Part of Bavinck's larger dogmatic project (Gereformeerde Dogmatiek). Written within a confessional Reformed, covenantal framework and in dialogue with Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Enlightenment, and emerging liberal/Arminian objections.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ's one sacrifice is the objective, efficacious ground of salvation; the Lord's Supper is the sacramental sign-and-seal by which the benefit of that sacrifice is communicated to believers. Bavinck defends both the necessity and particular efficacy of the atonement while insisting on the sacrament's real, spiritual communion with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes the **necessity** of a sacrifice: sin requires satisfaction before a holy God - guilt, wrath, and the disruption of communion demand an objective remedy.
 - Explicates the **nature of Christ's sacrifice**: unique, once-for-all, priestly and substitutionary; accomplishing reconciliation, propitiation, and forgiveness.
 - Situates the atonement in **covenant language**: Christ as covenant mediator whose sacrifice secures covenant blessings for his people.
 - Defines the **Lord's Supper** as a sacramental application: a visible sign and spiritual means by which believers partake of Christ's benefits through faith and the Holy Spirit.
 - Clarifies the **relation between objective accomplishment and subjective appropriation** - the sacrifice is fully effective objectively and is received and applied in time by faith through Word and sacrament.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Anselm, Calvin, medieval scholastics, Roman Catholic sacramental theology, Lutheran real presence debates, 19th-century liberal and Arminian critics; also Kuyper and contemporary Reformed interlocutors.
- **Doctrines treated:** Atonement (necessity, extent, theories), Christology (mediator, priest, sacrifice), covenant theology, sacraments (sign, seal, spiritual presence), justification, reconciliation, and the Holy Spirit's role in appropriation.
- **Closing line:** Bavinck centers Reformed soteriology on an objective, covenantal sacrifice accomplished in Christ and sacramentally offered and applied to the elect by Word, Spirit, and faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firmly **covenantal** reading of sacrifice and sacrament: sacrifice secures covenant blessings; the Supper seals them.
 - Careful balance of **objective efficacy** (accomplished once-for-all) with **subjective appropriation** (faith, Spirit, and sacrament).
 - Stress on **real spiritual presence** in the Supper - not physical corporeal presence but genuine communion mediated by the Spirit.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Rejects purely **moral-influence** or mere exemplarist readings of Christ's death.
 - Critiques Roman Catholic accounts that construe the Mass as a re-presentation of the atoning sacrifice; insists on the uniqueness and sufficiency of Christ's one offering.
 - Distinguishes from simplistic universalism by affirming **universal sufficiency** but **particular efficacy** (Christ's death is sufficient for all, efficient for the elect).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced insistence on both **sufficiency and efficacy** language about atonement extent - a clarity that preserves universal intent of provision and particularity of application.
 - Terminological precision between **satisfaction**, **propitiation**, and **reconciliation** within a covenantal forensic schema.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in Reformed scholastic renewal and in conservative Reformed sacramental theology; used as a corrective to liberal and reductionist theories of atonement.
 - Valued for historical-theological breadth and careful synthesis of scholastic, patristic, and Reformation materials.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models how to hold together objective accomplishment and sacramental appropriation without collapsing one into the other.
 - Serves as a mature, accessible Reformed account for teaching on atonement and the Lord's Supper.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrifice (of Christ):** The unique, once-for-all offering by which Christ satisfies divine justice and removes sin; both priestly act and covenantal performance.
- **Propitiation:** God's holy wrath turned away in Christ; Bavinck uses it as forensic averting of deserved wrath.
- **Satisfaction:** The compensatory or honor-restoring work by which Christ meets the claims of divine righteousness.
- **Substitution:** Christ bearing the penal consequences of sin in the place of sinners; central to Bavinck's atonement account.
- **Penal substitution:** The specific formulation by which guilt and punishment are borne by Christ; affirmed within a broader covenantal frame.
- **Sufficiency vs. Efficacy:** Distinction taught consistently - Christ's death is sufficient for all, efficacious for the elect (universal provision, particular application).
- **Covenant mediation:** Christ as mediator who secures covenant promises by his sacrifice; sacraments are covenant seals.
- **Lord's Supper / Eucharist:** A sign and seal that communicates Christ's benefits; real spiritual presence rather than physical corporeal presence.
- **Sign and Seal:** Terminology emphasizing the sacrament's communicative, covenant-confirming function.
- **Real Spiritual Presence:** Presence of Christ effected by the Spirit - genuine communion without local bodily presence.
- **Objective Accomplishment / Subjective Appropriation:** The twofold movement - what Christ has done and how believers receive it (by faith, Word, Spirit, sacrament).
- **Reconciliation / Expiation / Redemption:** Complementary terms describing the removal of hostility, the cleansing of guilt, and liberation from bondage.
- **Faith (as instrument):** Faith is the instrumental means by which sacramental benefits are received; not meritorious but receptive.
- **Priesthood (Christ):** Christ's unique priestly role as sacrificer and mediator, terminating earthly repetitive offerings.
- **Sacramental efficacy:** The Lord's Supper is a means of grace when received in faith; not magical but effectual by Spirit.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a confessional Reformed understanding of atonement and sacrament - precise doctrinal formulations.
 - As a **polemic** text against moral-influence, re-sacrificial Romanist, and reductionist liberal theories.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for linking Pauline soteriology, covenant theology, and sacramental practice in systematic teaching.
