### TITLE
Perspectives on the Word of God - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** late 20th-century Reformed evangelical theology, within a broadly presuppositional/apologetic milieu shaped by Cornelius Van Til and developing toward Frame's triperspectival method; responding to neo-orthodoxy (Barthian tendencies), liberal critical trends, and some charismatic claims about the "living Word."
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What does it mean to speak of Scripture as the Word of God? Frame argues for a multifaceted but unified doctrine: the Word must be treated simultaneously as divine revelation, incarnate reality, propositional truth, historical writing, and ecclesial proclamation; failure to hold these perspectives together produces error in doctrine and practice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposit the multiple senses in which "Word" is used (Logos, Scripture, preaching, Christ).
 - Defend the propositional and objective character of Scripture against extreme subjectivism and Barthian-functionalism.
 - Explain the role of the Holy Spirit in making Scripture efficacious (illumination, testimony) without collapsing divine authority into human experience.
 - Locate Scripture within the covenantal framework that governs revelation, salvation, and Christian life (implications for vocation, culture, eschatology).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** engages Barth and neo-orthodoxy (critique of "Scripture-as-Word-only-when-God-uses-it"), Bultmann and existentialist readings (against demythologizing), Van Til and Bahnsen (presuppositional apologetics), and constructive dialogue with evangelical bibliology (classic Protestant confessions).
- **Doctrines treated:** bibliology (inspiration, inerrancy, authority, canon), revelation (general and special), pneumatology (illumination, testimony of the Spirit), Christology (Word incarnate), covenant theology (revelational and redemptive-historical structure), anthropology (psychosomatic unity and eschatological destiny), common/ preparatory grace, vocation/dominium and cultural mandate, and eschatology (new heavens and new earth).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Scripture is the authoritative, propositional, covenantal Word of God that must be confessed as both objectively true and subjectively efficacious through the Spirit - a doctrine aimed to reconcile divine sovereignty, historical particularity, and ecclesial proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insistence on a deliberate holding-together of multiple "perspectives" on the Word (ontological/Christological, propositional/written, and performative/preached), rather than elevating one exclusively.
 - Integration of bibliology with apologology: Scripture's status is argued from presuppositional grounds about the knowing subject and God's authority.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Barthian "functional" accounts by affirming Scripture's objective propositional content and historical reliability.
 - Challenges existentialist and emotivist readings that reduce Scripture to subjective encounter; likewise critiques some charismatic over-emphasis on present private revelations absent the canonical standard.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulation of the Word as simultaneously normative, revelatory, and performative - language that feeds Frame's later triperspectival language (normative-nominal-… relations).
 - Clarifies the relation between illumination and inerrancy: Spirit's witness does not add new propositional content but enables appropriation of canonical truth.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles for clarifying bibliology and resisting neo-orthodoxy.
 - Influential among students of apologology and pastors seeking a robust doctrine of preaching and Scripture; less persuasive to Barthian and liberal interlocutors.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, systematic treatment useful for courses on Scripture, preaching, and apologetics.
 - Functions as a bridge between abstract epistemological claims and pastoral concerns about proclamation and Christian life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God:** multi-layered; refers to the eternal Logos (Christ), the canonical Scripture, and the preached/proclaimed Word - all related but not identical.
- **Scripture (canonical written Word):** propositional, historically situated, authoritative and sufficient for faith and life; objectively true and inerrant in Frame's usage.
- **Revelation (general & special):**
 - General revelation: God's disclosure in creation and conscience - real but not saving apart from special revelation.
 - Special revelation: covenantal, particular disclosure culminating in Christ and recorded in Scripture.
- **Inspiration:** divine authorship/oversight that guarantees truthfulness and authority of the biblical documents without negating human authorship.
- **Inerrancy:** Scripture without error in its propositions as intended by God and written by human authors.
- **Illumination/Testimony of the Spirit:** Spirit enables understanding and assent to Scripture's truths; not a source of new propositional revelation.
- **Propositional truth:** key to Frame's bibliology - Scripture communicates truths that can be believed and argued; opposes pure existentialist reductions.
- **Word incarnate (Logos):** Christ as the ultimate Word; Scripture bears witness to and serves Christ's lordship.
- **Preaching/Proclamation:** performative instance of the Word; not creating new revelation but applying the canonical Word within the covenant community.
- **Canon:** the normative corpus that fixes the content of the written Word and bounds legitimate proclamation.
- **Common/Preparatory Grace:** theological categories showing how general revelation and prevenient grace prepare sinners for reception of the special Word.
- **Vocation/Dominion (culture mandate):** Scripture grounds Christian engagement in culture and duties of vocation, linking bibliology to ethics and eschatology.
- **New Heavens and New Earth / Eschatological anthropology:** biblical hope reframes the authority and telos of the Word toward consummation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise definitional resource in bibliology and preaching courses (definition source).
- As a polemic against neo-orthodoxy, radical subjectivism, and careless charismatic claims about "new revelation" (polemic/reference).
- As an exegetical and pastoral model for integrating biblical propositional content with Spirit-empowered proclamation (exegetical/pastoral model).
- As a conceptual pivot for linking doctrine of Scripture to covenantal ethics, vocation, and eschatology (integrative framework).
