### TITLE
Ambigua (Ambigua ad Ioannem) - Maximus the Confessor

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid-7th century Byzantine monastic-theological milieu; composed amid the **Monothelite controversy** and the political-theological ferment under Heraclius and his successors.
 - Written as a collection of answers (ambigua) to "difficult" or ambiguous passages in the Gospel of John and related Christological texts; functions both exegetically and dogmatically.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To preserve **the full integrity of Christ's two natures** (without division or confusion) while maintaining the unity of the one Person (hypostasis), and to rebut theological shortcuts (e.g., Monothelitism) that collapse distinction into unity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegetical readings of Johannine and patristic passages are used to derive principled distinctions between nature and person.
 - Major moves:
 - Define how predicates and actions apply to Christ: which belong properly to a nature and which to the one hypostasis.
 - Show that divine and human properties are not mixed but are united in the one Person (theandric union).
 - Deduce the necessity of **two wills and two operations** (dyothelitism) as an implication of Chalcedonian and hypostatic commitments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages patristic authorities: Cyril of Alexandria, Gregory Nazianzen, Augustine (with caution), Pseudo-Dionysius; constant appeal to **Chalcedonian formulations** and to contemporaneous Monothelite proponents.
 - Implicitly addresses ecclesial actors promoting Monothelitism (e.g., imperial theologians and some patriarchal positions).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (primary): hypostatic union, theandric activity, wills and operations.
 - Secondary: Trinity (in procession language and economy), soteriology (how union effects redemption), and hermeneutics (patristic exegesis).
- **Closing line**
 - The Ambigua centers on a disciplined grammar of person and nature: sustaining Chalcedonian two-natures-in-one-person so that Christ's actions, wills, and attributes remain both distinct in origin and united in personal subjectivity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Rigorous insistence that predicates are attributed according to **nature (physis) and hypostasis (person)**, avoiding both Nestorian separation and Monophysite confusion.
 - Development of a nuanced **theandric** vocabulary: Christ's acts are truly divine and truly human, not mere expressions of one nature over the other.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Corrects Monothelite tendencies by arguing that a single energetic or volitional account collapses the human reality of Christ.
 - Reframes certain Alexandrian and Antiochene emphases so that neither tradition's excesses undermine personal unity.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise deployment of **hypostasis/ousia** distinctions in pastoral-exegetical contexts; anticipatory formulation of what will be defended at the Sixth Ecumenical Council.
 - Use of subtle distinctions between "operation" and "will" as doctrinal leverage.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in Byzantine theology and decisive for the eventual repudiation of Monothelitism at the Sixth Council (680-681).
 - In Western and Reformed readings, Maximus is often cited for his careful Chalcedonian fidelity and for constructive Trinitarian clarifications; Protestants value his precision on person/nature though he is less central than Augustine for Western traditions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how close exegesis of Scripture and patristic synthesis can resolve high-level dogmatic disputes; indispensable for advanced study of post-Chalcedonian Christology and dogmatic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Maximus insists on a single personal subject (hypostasis) in whom two complete natures subsist; the union is personal, not ontologically conflating natures.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine**
 - Uses Chalcedon as normative grammar: "in two natures unconfusedly, unchangeably, indivisibly, inseparably"; Ambigua supplies exegetical justification for attributing actions to the appropriate nature while preserving one person.
- **Dyothelitism (Two Wills)**
 - Derived as a necessary corollary: if Christ has a complete human nature, he must have a human will and operation alongside the divine will - central polemic against Monothelitism.
- **Theandric (Divine-human) Action**
 - Termed to express actions that are truly divine and truly human without blending the underlying natures.
- **Hypostasis / Ousia distinction**
 - Technical deployment to safeguard personhood (hypostasis) against reduction to essence (ousia) - crucial for attributing properties.
- **Prosopon vs. Hypostasis**
 - Recapitulates patristic care: prosopon (appearance/role) cannot be substituted for ontological hypostasis in Christological claims.
- **Procession / Filioque (ecumenical creeds)**
 - While upholding Nicene-Constantinopolitan creedal integrity, Maximus permits language of the Spirit's sending "through the Son" as a way to acknowledge the Son's mediating role, without denying the Father's monarchy of origin; used later in East-West dialogue as a mediating posture.
- **Economy (Oikonomia)**
 - Distinguishes the internal life of the Trinity from the economy of salvation: union and operations in Christ are economica manifestations without altering intra-Trinitarian relations.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for Chalcedonian Christology and the logic that necessitates dyothelitism.
- As a **polemic model** against Monothelitism and related Christological reductions.
- As an **exegetical model** for attributing predicates to Christ in Johannine and patristic texts, and as a conceptual pivot in Trinitarian/Filioque discussions where "through the Son" language is weighed carefully.
