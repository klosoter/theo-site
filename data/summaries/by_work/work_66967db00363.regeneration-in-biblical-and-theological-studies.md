### TITLE
Regeneration (B. B. Warfield) 
Author: Benjamin B. Warfield (Princeton theologian). 
Primary focus: doctrinal and exegetical defense of the new birth as a sovereign, Spirit‑wrought ontological change; engagement with pneumatology and soteriology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton Reformed theology; reaction to liberal Protestantism, higher criticism, and various anti‑Calvinistic emphases.
 - Warfield writes within the confessional Calvinist tradition; seeks to conserve classical formulations against modern reinterpretations.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Regeneration (the new birth) is a real, immediate, and sovereign act of the Holy Spirit that imparts a new principle of spiritual life; it is distinct from, yet foundational for, conversion, faith, and sanctification.
 - The problem addressed: how to define and locate regeneration amid competing accounts that reduce it to moral improvement, psychological change, or mere symbolism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegesis of key texts (John 3; Titus 3; Ephesians 2; John 6; Romans 6) to demonstrate biblical grounding for a Spirit‑wrought ontological change.
 - Theological analysis distinguishing:
 - Regeneration as the implanting of a new spiritual principle.
 - Conversion as the composite human response (faith + repentance) enabled by regeneration.
 - Indwelling as the abiding presence and communion of Spirit/Christ following or accompanying the new birth.
 - Polemic: refutation of views that make regeneration gradual, purely moral, or synonymous with external calling.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Augustine, Calvin, John Owen, and earlier Reformed confessions for classical formulations.
 - Opposes contemporary liberal theologians and Arminian tendencies that stress human initiative or reduce regeneration to ethical reform.
 - Dialogues implicitly with Hodge and successors at Princeton to preserve confessional continuity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (work of the Holy Spirit), soteriology (effectual calling, justification, sanctification), anthropology (total depravity and the need for a new principle), and Christology in the sense of union with Christ by the Spirit.

- **Specific site usages (topics cited)**
 - **Regeneration and Indwelling:** Warfield distinguishes the new life imparted at regeneration from the fuller, continued indwelling presence of the Spirit; regeneration is the root, indwelling is the abiding relational outworking.
 - **Regeneration and Effectual Calling:** Treats effectual calling and regeneration as closely related aspects of the same divine saving act - calling as the external summons, regeneration as the internal sovereign impartation that renders the call effectual.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the doctrine of regeneration on the Spirit's sovereign, instantaneous impartation of new spiritual life as the necessary ground of genuine faith and spiritual fruit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the ontological reality of the new birth - not merely subjective feeling or moral reorientation but a new principle of life given by the Spirit.
 - Careful lexical and exegetical defense of Scripture to resist reductionist readings.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal and modernist minimizations of supernatural agency in salvation.
 - Contrasts with Arminian and Wesleyan emphases on prevenient grace and gradual awakening; Warfield stresses divine initiative and immediacy.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes phraseology such as "new inward principle" or "root of the spiritual life" to capture regeneration's ontological character (precision rather than novel vocabulary).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; reinforced Princeton‑style confessional soteriology.
 - Criticized by non‑Reformed theologians and modern theologians who emphasize existential/ethical readings of conversion.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a rigorously exegetical and theological template for teaching regeneration within historic Reformed soteriology.
 - Serves as a reliable polemical resource against reductionist accounts and as a clarifying touchstone for pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regeneration / New birth**
 - The Spirit's impartation of a new spiritual life; immediate and substantial change in the sinner's moral and spiritual status.

- **New principle (principium novum)**
 - Warfield's shorthand for the implanted moral‑spiritual disposition that enables faith and holiness.

- **Effectual calling**
 - The external divine summons wedded to an internal sovereign act (regeneration) that secures a willing response.

- **Indwelling**
 - The abiding presence of the Spirit (and, by union, of Christ) that follows or accompanies regeneration; described distinctly from the initial impartation.

- **Conversion**
 - Composite human act (faith + repentance) enabled by regeneration; not identical with regeneration but dependent on it.

- **Ontological change**
 - Technical way to assert regeneration is a real change in the person's spiritual being, not merely subjective reorientation.

- **Immediate vs progressive regeneration**
 - Warfield argues for the immediacy/instantaneous character of being born again while allowing for progressive outworking in sanctification.

- **Moral transformation (critique)**
 - Warfield rejects accounts that reduce regeneration to moral influence or ethical reform.

- **Prevenient grace (rejection)**
 - Implicitly opposed: Warfield stresses sovereign efficacious grace rather than a neutral grace enabling human choice prior to regeneration.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Regeneration is the root reality by which the believer is united to Christ by the Spirit.

- **Scriptural loci often used**
 - John 3; John 6; Ephesians 2; Titus 3; Romans 6 - used to ground the doctrine exegetically.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for the classical Reformed understanding of regeneration (seminary courses, systematic theologies).
 - As a **polemic** against liberal/Arminian reductions of the new birth.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating Johannine and Pauline texts into a coherent pneumatology and soteriology.
