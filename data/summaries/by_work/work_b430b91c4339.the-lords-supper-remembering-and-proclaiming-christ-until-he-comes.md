### TITLE
The Lord's Supper: Remembering and Proclaiming Christ Until He Comes - Thomas Schreiner & Matthew Crawford

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary conservative Reformed-evangelical context addressing late 20th-21st century Eucharistic debates.
 - Pastoral-theological aim: accessible defense of a Reformed sacramental conviction for pastors, elders, and lay leaders.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Lord's Supper is simultaneously **remembrance (anamnesis)** and **proclamation**, a covenantal sign and seal that communicates Christ to believers by the Spirit until his return; it rejects a corporeal presence or a mere memorialism that strips the supper of sacramental efficacy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis of key texts (Luke 22; 1 Corinthians 11; John 6) to establish institution, meaning of "body" and "blood," and the supper's functions.
 - Historical-theological survey situating Reformed teaching against Roman Catholic transubstantiation, Lutheran sacramental union, and Zwinglian memorialism.
 - Theological synthesis: the supper as a means of grace - a covenant sign/seal - where Christ is spiritually present and believers are nourished by the Spirit through faith.
 - Pastoral application: worthy reception, church discipline, frequency, catechesis, and the supper's eschatological horizon ("until he comes").
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture, the Church Fathers, Augustine, Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and both historic and contemporary Reformed writers.
 - Dialogues with Roman Catholic and Lutheran sacramental theology and with modern evangelical memorialist tendencies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sacraments/sacramental theology, covenant theology, Christology (once-for-all atonement), pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental efficacy), ecclesiology (unity, discipline), eschatology (foretaste/anticipatory nature).
- **Closing line**
 - The Lord's Supper is a covenant sign that both **remembers Christ's finished work** and **proclaims his present, spiritual benefit to faith** until the consummation of all things.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the **proclamatory function** of the supper: it is not merely a passive remembrance but an active proclamation of Gospel realities until Christ returns.
 - Affirms a **real spiritual presence** (Calvinist nuance): Christ is truly received by faith and by the Spirit, without endorsing corporeal presence.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Firmly rejects **transubstantiation** (Roman) and **consubstantiation/physical presence** (Lutheran) while also critiquing pure **memorialism** (Zwingli) as biblically inadequate.
 - Reiterates that sacramental efficacy is conditioned on **faith** and mediated by the Spirit, opposing both a magical view of rites and a purely symbolic reading.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Uses the language of **"remembrance and proclamation"** as a unifying rubric; describes the supper as a **covenant sign and seal** rather than a literal repetition of sacrifice.
- **Reception & influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed evangelical circles as a concise, pastoral exposition; valued for clarity in pulpit and classroom.
 - Served as an accessible corrective in denominational debates over paedocommunion, frequency, and the nature of real presence.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a balanced, historically informed model useful for pastors, catechists, and seminary courses; durable for teaching the Reformed sacramental synthesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper / Eucharist / Communion** - the Christian meal instituted by Christ; Schreiner & Crawford use "Lord's Supper" with Reformed emphases.
- **Remembrance (anamnesis)** - memorial aspect: recall of Christ's death as decisive event.
- **Proclamation** - the supper announces and testifies to Gospel realities; a public sermon in sacramental form.
- **Covenant sign and seal** - sacrament functions to confirm God's promises to believers (seal) and signify covenant realities (sign).
- **Real presence (spiritual)** - Christ truly present by the Spirit to the faith of communicants, distinguished from bodily presence.
- **Means of grace** - the supper is an instrument through which God communicates saving benefits to the faithful.
- **Memorialism** - the view that the supper is purely symbolic; critiqued for understatement of sacramental efficacy.
- **Transubstantiation / corporal presence** - rejected categories; not the Reformed position.
- **Worthy reception / discipline** - ethical and ecclesial conditions for proper participation (1 Cor 11); includes self-examination and church oversight.
- **Eschatological dimension ("until he comes")** - the supper as a foretaste and proclamation of the coming kingdom.
- **Paedocommunion** - discussed or implied in debates; authors generally align with covenantal but credobaptist practice requiring faith for reception.
- **Spiritual nourishment / feeding** - believers spiritually fed by Christ through the supper by the Spirit.
- **Anamnetic-proclamatory model** - phrase to capture their synthesis: remembering + public proclamation.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a Reformed sacramental theology (seminaries, catechisms).
 - As a **polemic tool** against Roman Catholic/Lutheran readings and against reductive memorialism.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching, catechesis, and liturgical formation in Reformed churches.
