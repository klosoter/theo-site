### TITLE
The Evidence for Jesus - James D. G. Dunn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th century historical‑critical New Testament scholarship; part of the "third quest" for the historical Jesus and the wider project to situate earliest Christian belief within Jewish apocalyptic expectations. Dunn writes as an Anglican New Testament scholar engaging both academic-critical and church audiences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The most convincing historical evidence for who Jesus was and what he accomplished is the early Christian proclamation of the resurrection, construed as God's inauguration of the new creation; this proclamation both explains and is rooted in early experiences and traditions that can be historically investigated.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Survey of the earliest testimony (Pauline creeds, kerygma, Gospel traditions) to establish the antiquity and centrality of resurrection belief.
 - Historical analysis arguing that persistent, early, and multiple attestations make the core claim historically credible.
 - Theological interpretation: resurrection should be understood as transformation into the new creation (not mere resuscitation) and as the decisive matrix for earliest Christology.
 - Engagement with skepticism (mythicist and reductionist explanations) and with theological apologetics; argues for a middle path that honors historical methods without reducing proclamation to legend or hallucination.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Pauline corpus (esp. 1 Corinthians 15), pre‑Pauline creedal formulas, Synoptic and Johannine materials, interlocutors include Bultmann, Schweitzer, modern skeptics (e.g., mythicists), and contemporaries like N. T. Wright and E. P. Sanders at the level of eschatology and resurrection interpretation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (as event and witness), Christology (origin and early high claims), Resurrection (historic and theological), Eschatology/New Creation (resurrection as inauguration), and implicit anthropology (bodily transformation vs. resuscitation).
- **Closing line:** Dunn situates the resurrection as the historically grounded, theologically decisive act by which God brings about the new creation and thereby provides the primary evidence for Jesus' identity and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that resurrection is best read as the inauguration of *new creation* rather than a return to ordinary life.
 - Emphasis on the interplay of *experience* (encounters with the risen Lord) and *proclamation* (kerygma/creeds) as mutually reinforcing historical data.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against Bultmannian existentializing or demythologizing that reduces resurrection to subjectivized faith.
 - Rejection of mythicist or purely psychological explanations that ignore the complexity and early dating of traditions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tightening of the language linking resurrection and new‑creation vocabulary - reframing resurrection language as cosmic/eschatological re‑making, not private visionary experience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in mainstream academic and church contexts as a judicious defense of the historicity and theological centrality of the resurrection.
 - Influenced both evangelical and mainline treatments that seek to combine rigorous historical method with robust theological claims; critics from both liberal and radical camps have challenged some historical judgments.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Models how to integrate historical-critical methodology with constructive theological interpretation centered on resurrection/new creation.
 - Serves as a corrective to reductionist accounts while remaining open to historical constraints.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma:** The early proclamation pattern (creedal formulas) that preserves the earliest convictions about Jesus, especially resurrection; used as primary historical datum.
- **Pre‑Pauline creed:** Early confessional summaries (e.g., 1 Cor 15) that Dunn treats as high‑value evidence for earliest belief.
- **Resurrection as new creation:** Dunn's decisive interpretive move - resurrection inaugurates the eschatological renewal of creation rather than merely reviving Jesus' old body.
- **Experience of the risen Lord:** Reports of encounters (seen, heard, touched) treated as historically significant phenomena explaining the origin of proclamation.
- **Historical-critical criteria:** Use of early attestation, multiple attestation, and coherence to assess the reliability of traditions.
- **High Christology:** Earliest elevated claims about Jesus (lordship, exaltation) rooted in resurrection experience and proclamation.
- **Apocalyptic eschatology:** Jewish matrix that gives intelligibility to resurrection/new-creation claims; Dunn situates Jesus within this horizon.
- **Holistic body/embodiment:** Distinction from resuscitation - resurrection involves transformed embodied existence appropriate to new creation.
- **Anti-mythicist stance:** Rejection of theories that see resurrection as wholly mythic or later Hellenistic invention.
- **Proclamation/explanation loop:** The dynamic by which experience produces proclamation which then organizes memory and testimony; key to Dunn's method.
- **Pauline centrism:** Heavy reliance on Pauline evidence as earliest and most diagnostically valuable material.
- **Third‑quest continuity:** Alignment with modern historical Jesus scholarship that seeks continuity with Judaism and early Christian faith.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for locating resurrection theology within new‑creation language.
- As a **polemic** against mythicist and reductionist explanations of resurrection reports.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading creeds and Pauline fragments as historically primary and theologically formative.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching: linking historical investigation to constructive theology grounded in resurrection/new creation.
