### TITLE
Francis Turretin and the Reformed Tradition (ed. Richard A. Muller) - secondary studies on the theology, method, and reception of Francis Turretin (17th-century Reformed scholastic).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century Geneva and the high period of Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687) as Geneva Academy professor. 
 - Edited volume (Muller) situating Turretin within confessional controversies after the Synodical era and in dialogue with early modern philosophy (Cartesianism, Molinism, Arminianism, Amyraldianism, Socinianism).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Turretin represents a sustained, sophisticated defense of classical Reformed orthodoxy: his theological method, biblical fidelity, and polemical engagement secure divine sovereignty, forensic imputation, and covenantal structure against rival systems.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves in the volume)**
 - Historical reconstruction: Turretin's formation, institutional role, and relation to Geneva's confessional identity.
 - Methodological analysis: scholastic categories, logical method, and use/limits of contemporary philosophy.
 - Doctrinal exegesis and polemic: systematic treatments of sin, will, predestination, covenant, and canon; direct rebuttals of Molina, Arminius, Amyraut, and Socinians.
 - Reception and legacy: influence on later Reformed orthodoxy and modern historiography of Reformed theology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Turretin as central figure; engaged opponents include Luis de Molina (Molinism), Jacob Arminius (Arminianism), Moses Amyraut (Amyraldianism), Socinian critics; engagement with Cartesian and scholastic sources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology (canon and tradition), theology proper (divine knowledge, decree), providence and theodicy, sin and human will (total depravity, inability), original sin and imputation, covenant theology (works/grace), justification/atonement, predestination (election/reprobation).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Turretin, as presented in this volume, is the exemplar of a confessional Reformed scholasticism that insists on God's absolute sovereignty, forensic covenantal relationships, and rigorous defenses against perceived theological innovations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise forensic language for imputation and justification; sharp distinction between the origin of sin (God permits) and guilt/responsibility (creaturely).
 - Methodological fidelity to scholastic syllogistic procedure while selectively appropriating early-modern philosophical resources.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Strong corrective to Amyraldian hypothetical universalism and to Molinist middle-knowledge - defends particular election and efficacious grace.
 - Opposes Arminian appeals to libertarian contingency by articulating a compatibilist account of will and moral responsibility.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced use of categories such as efficacia (efficacious grace), imputatio (forensic imputation), and theodicy framed by decrees and divine justice.
 - Clarifies covenantal typologies (covenant of works vs. covenant of grace) with sharp forensic consequences for soteriology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major source for later Reformed confessionalists (e.g., Princeton and conservative Reformed seminaries); revived scholarly interest through Muller's historiography which reframes Turretin as both traditional and responsive to early modern thought.
- **Enduring value**
 - A methodological model for historical-theological synthesis; indispensable for advanced study of doctrine of sin, predestination, and bibliology in the Reformed tradition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total Depravity / Total Inability**
 - Turretin defends human inability for saving good apart from sovereign grace; will is bound by sin though morally responsible.
- **Original Sin / Imputation**
 - Federalist imputation: Adam's guilt and corrupted nature legally reckoned to descendants; explains corporate culpability and hereditary depravity.
- **Sin and Free Will**
 - Compatibilist model: will acts according to nature and inclinations yet bears moral culpability; freedom defined as voluntary concurrence, not metaphysical indeterminacy.
- **Predestination (Election & Reprobation)**
 - Divine decree as eternal, particular, and efficacious; reprobation articulated within divine justice, not arbitrary caprice.
- **Theodicy & Divine Justice**
 - Defense of God's righteousness in permitting sin and executing decree; distinguishes permission from causation and attributes blame to creatures.
- **Covenant Theology (Works/Grace)**
 - Firm articulation of two federal covenants with forensic consequences for law, gospel, and imputation.
- **Canon & Tradition (Bibliology)**
 - Sola Scriptura posture with qualified use of tradition and confessions as subordinate, regulative aids to theological formulation.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism**
 - Systematic rebuttal of middle knowledge: God's providence understood through decretive knowledge rather than counterfactuals known apart from decree.
- **Efficacious Grace**
 - Grace is effectual for the elect; distinguished from antecedent, prevenient offers in rival schemes.
- **Reformed Scholasticism**
 - Methodological label: disciplined, conceptual theology using scholastic tools to organize Biblical doctrine.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed positions (sin, imputation, predestination).
 - As a **polemic model** against Molinist, Arminian, and Amyraldian alternatives.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading covenantal passages within a forensic framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in historiography: reframing Turretin as central to continuity and adaptation within Reformed orthodoxy.
