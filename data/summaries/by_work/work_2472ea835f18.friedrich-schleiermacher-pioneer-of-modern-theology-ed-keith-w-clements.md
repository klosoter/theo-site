### TITLE
Friedrich Schleiermacher: Pioneer of Modern Theology (ed. Keith W. Clements) - Selected Writings and Framing Essays

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late Enlightenment and early Romanticism (Berlin, c. 1799-1831); post-Kantian epistemic crisis; Pietist upbringing with Reformed leanings.
 - Clements curates key texts (On Religion; Brief Outline; The Christian Faith; sermons; letters) to display Schleiermacher's architecture of modern Protestant dogmatics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Re-found theology not on speculative metaphysics or bare moral rationalism but on the **immediate feeling of absolute dependence** that constitutes specifically Christian piety, normed by the communal consciousness of redemption in Christ.
- **Core argument or structure (Schleiermacher's dogmatic arc)**
 - **Method**: Dogmatics is a descriptive science of the church's piety; doctrines systematize what is believed in the community.
 - **Religion**: Not primarily knowledge or ethics, but **Gefuhl** (feeling) as immediate self-consciousness of dependence upon God.
 - **Revelation and Scripture**: Revelation is God's self-communication in the Redeemer and his community; Scripture is the normative witness of this communal consciousness.
 - **Sin**: Disordered self-consciousness; obstruction of God-consciousness within personal and social life.
 - **Christology**: Christ as the **archetypal Redeemer**, possessing perfect, uninterrupted God-consciousness; his redemptive causality communicates this to the church.
 - **Pneumatology and Ecclesiology**: The **Spirit** is the communal life of Christ operative in the church, generating faith, sanctification, and fellowship.
 - **Soteriology**: Redemption as incorporation into the community where Christ's God-consciousness is communicated; justification and sanctification are coordinated aspects of this participation.
 - **Sacraments**: Baptism and the Supper as ecclesial acts that represent and intensify the community's relation to Christ.
 - **Election**: Corporate election **in Christ**; predestination speaks of the church's being chosen in the Redeemer rather than decretal individuation.
 - **Trinity**: Placed at the conclusion as the summary dogmatic representation of Christian piety's Godward, Christic, and pneumatic dimensions.
 - **Eschatology**: Consummation of God-consciousness in the perfected ethical community; guarded about speculative apocalyptic detail.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kant (critique and appropriation), Spinoza, Romanticism (Schlegel, Novalis), Pietism, and the Reformed tradition; later reception by Ritschl, Harnack; major critique from Barth; nuanced retrievals by Bavinck, Pannenberg, modern ecclesiologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, method; God and divine attributes; sin and grace; Christology; Spirit and church; sacraments; election; Trinity; eschatology; ethics and practical theology; hermeneutics.
- **Center of gravity**
 - The **communal God-consciousness** given in the Redeemer by the Spirit is the material principle; every doctrine explicates this redemptive participation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Religion as **feeling of absolute dependence**; dogmatics as descriptive of ecclesial piety; Christ's redemptive causality as communication of God-consciousness; Trinity derived from and summarizing Christian experience.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against rationalist moralism: insists on irreducible religious immediacy.
 - Against metaphysical scholasticism: subordinates speculative essence-talk to soteriological function.
 - Against individualism: stresses the **church** as the locus of redemption and Spirit.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - God-consciousness; immediate self-consciousness; archetypal Redeemer; communal Spirit; doctrine as representation of piety; Trinity as concluding synopsis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Seedbed of liberal Protestant dogmatics; mediated through Ritschl and Harnack.
 - Critiqued by Barth for subjectivism and functionalism, yet indirectly formative for 20th-century hermeneutics, ecclesiology, and practical theology.
 - Reformed theologians often reject his method yet engage his corporate election, ecclesial mediation, and descriptive account of doctrine.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies theology's relation to church life and experience; integrates pneumatology and ecclesiology; provokes careful method-testing in Trinity, Christology, and eschatology; a constructive foil for covenantal and classical accounts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence**: Immediate awareness of creaturely contingency before God; religion's essence.
 - Contrasts with cognition-only or ethics-only accounts of religion.
- **God-consciousness**: The lived, affective orientation to God; in Christ it is perfect and uninterrupted.
- **Piety (Gemeinschaft)**: Communal shape of faith; the church as the sphere where redemption is actual.
- **Redeemer / archetypal Christ**: The one in whom God-consciousness is archetypally complete and communicative.
- **Redemptive causality**: Christ's ongoing efficacy in forming the church's life through the Spirit.
- **Spirit of the community**: Pneumatology as Christ's life actualized in ecclesial fellowship, gifts, and sanctification.
- **Dogmatics as descriptive science**: Systematizing what the church believes and experiences, not imposing speculative systems.
- **Revelation as self-communication**: Centered in the person and history of Jesus and mediated communally; Scripture as normative witness.
- **Sin as obstruction**: Disruption of God-consciousness personally and socially; soteriology heals and reorders.
- **Election in Christ**: Corporate, ecclesial predestination rather than primarily individuated decrees.
- **Sacraments as representation**: Baptism and Supper intensify and signify the community's participation in Christ.
- **Trinity as summary doctrine**: Doctrinal conclusion articulating God, Christ, and Spirit in the economy of redemption.
- **Eschatological consummation**: Teleological perfection of the church's God-consciousness; reticent about speculative timelines.
- **Covenant reframed**: Covenant language absorbed into ecclesial participation rather than federal-legal structures.
- **Hermeneutics and praxis**: Theology ordered to preaching, catechesis, and pastoral care within the community.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a conceptual pivot for **pneumatology and ecclesiology** (Spirit as communal life).
 - As a foil in **Trinity and Christology** debates over method and functionalism.
 - As a reference point in **covenant/election** discussions on corporate-in-Christ emphases.
 - As a methodological touchstone when defining **dogmatics** and the role of experience and Scripture.
