### TITLE
Contributions to Reformed Forum and Westminster Theological Journal on covenant themes - Peter A. Lillback

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed confessional milieu; contributions appear in platforms aimed at conservative Presbyterian and Reformed readers (Reformed Forum) and scholarly audience (Westminster Theological Journal).
 - Engagement occurs within renewed scholarly interest in covenantal hermeneutics, federal theology revival, and public/political implications of covenant theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Advocate for a classical **Reformed federal (covenant) theology** as the organizing framework of Scripture and Christian life, defending the covenants (works, redemption, grace) against dilution, revision, or rival systems (dispensationalism, certain revisionist covenant proposals).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of the **covenant of works** with Adam and its penal/representative consequences for humanity.
 - Emphasis on the **covenant of redemption** as eternal pact within the Trinity that grounds Christ's mediatorial role.
 - Presentation of the **covenant of grace** as the unfolding, typological, and progressively revealed administration of salvation culminating in Christ and continued in the church through sacraments.
 - Application of covenant theology to ecclesiology and polity (baptism as sign/seal, visible church boundaries) and to public theology (covenant implications for social order).
 - Frequent turn to historical confessions and Reformed orthodox sources to bolster doctrinal continuity and pastoral application.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Reformed authorities: Geerhardus Vos, Herman Bavinck, John Murray, Westminster Standards.
 - Engages contemporaries and rivals: Meredith Kline and other covenant theologians (for nuance), dispensationalists, and modern hermeneutical challengers.
 - Uses biblical exegesis (OT-NT continuity), patristic and Reformed scholastic sources for doctrinal proof-texting.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and hermeneutics (covenant as interpretive key), covenant (works/redemption/grace), Christology (mediatorial headship), soteriology (federal union), ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, baptism), sacraments (sign and seal), law/gospel relation, political theology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Lillback situates **classical confessional covenant theology** as the coherent, biblical, and ecclesial framework that integrates Christology, sacraments, and public witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on the covenant of redemption as the intra-Trinitarian, prior foundation for covenant of grace - using this to secure Christ's mediatorial work doctrinally.
 - Practical linkage of covenant theology to polity and public theology (not merely abstract doctrine).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushback against both dispensational fragmentation and revisionist covenant proposals that downplay federal headship or sacramental continuity.
 - Nuanced critique of certain Klinean or "new" formulations where they diverge from confessional standards.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulation of corporate/federal personality language to resist individualistic readings of soteriology and sacrament.
 - Clarifying use of confessional categories (works, redemption, grace) in contemporary debates rather than inventing new categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in confessional Reformed circles for clarity and fidelity to Westminster standards; used as a bridge between popular/confessional forums and academic discussion.
 - Influential in conservative Presbyterian debates about baptismal paedocommunion, covenant membership, and the church-state relationship.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable exemplar of integrating historical theology, biblical exegesis, and ecclesial application; useful for students needing a confessional, pastorally minded account of covenant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall covenant with Adam; accountability and federal headship that grounds original sin and condemnation.

- **Covenant of Redemption**
 - The eternal pact within the Trinity appointing Christ as mediator; secures the covenant of grace doctrinally.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The progressive administration of salvation historically revealed in promises, types, and sacraments culminating in Christ.

- **Federal Headship / Federal Union**
 - Corporate solidarity: Adam and Christ as representative heads whose acts are imputed to many.

- **Sign and Seal (Baptism)**
 - Sacramental language: baptism as the covenant sign and seal marking members of the covenant community.

- **Continuity / Typology**
 - Emphasis on organic OT-NT continuity via typological fulfillment rather than sharp discontinuity.

- **Antithesis**
 - Reformed principle marking doctrinal and moral distinction between covenant community and world.

- **Confessionalism**
 - Appeal to Westminster Standards and Reformed orthodox formulations as normative interpretive guides.

- **Mediatorial Kingship**
 - Christ's royal, priestly, and prophetic work as grounded in covenant roles.

- **Law and Gospel Relation**
 - Covenantal framework for distinguishing uses of the law while affirming its place in covenant life.

- **Covenant Hermeneutic**
 - Reading Scripture through covenantal categories to secure theological coherence.

- **Public / Political Covenant**
 - Use of covenant concepts to shape Christian civic engagement and understand corporate obligations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical confessional covenant categories in teaching and catechesis.
 - As a **polemic** resource against dispensational and revisionist covenant models.
 - As an **exegetical model** for OT-NT continuity and sacramental theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating doctrine with church polity and public witness.
