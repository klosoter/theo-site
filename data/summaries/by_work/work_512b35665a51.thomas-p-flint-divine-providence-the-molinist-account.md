### TITLE
Divine Providence: The Molinist Account - Thomas P. Flint (on the thought of Luis de Molina)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic-theological engagement with classical theism; a revival of interest in Luis de Molina (16th c.) and the Jesuit Molinist solution to foreknowledge and freedom.
 - Flint writes as a contemporary Catholic philosopher-theologian aiming to systematize and defend Molinism within current metaphysics and philosophy of religion.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Molinism offers the most coherent account of how divine providence, exhaustive divine foreknowledge, and genuine libertarian freedom coexist.
 - Flint argues that God's possession of *middle knowledge* (knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom) grounds a providential decree in which God freely chooses a world whose free creatures will perform certain acts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Explication of Molina's **threefold knowledge**: natural knowledge (what could be), middle knowledge (what creaturely free agents would do in any circumstance), and free knowledge (what will be after God's creative decree).
 - Formal account of **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom (CCFs)** and their truth-conditions; defense that CCFs have determinate truth-values prior to God's creative decree.
 - Response to the **grounding objection** (what makes a counterfactual true): options considered include primitive truthmakers, dispositions, and possible-worlds analyses; Flint defends a version compatible with classical theism.
 - Application to providence: God surveys the space of feasible worlds via middle knowledge and selects the world whose history best accomplishes divine purposes while preserving libertarian freedom.
 - Integration with doctrines of divine causation and concurrence: Flint explains how God can providentially bring about outcomes without coercing free choices.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Luis de Molina (Jesuit originator), later Jesuit defenders.
 - Historical opponents: Dominicans (Banez), Thomistic criticisms.
 - Modern interlocutors: Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig (sympathetic modern Molinists), and critics advancing the grounding objection or raising modal metaphysics challenges.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, foreknowledge, divine omniscience and omnipotence, human libertarian freedom, election and predestination, grace and merit, problem of evil insofar as providence intersects with moral responsibility.

- **Closing line**
 - Flint locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that **God's middle knowledge makes possible a providence that is both sovereign and non-coercive**, enabling genuine creaturely freedom within a divinely orchestrated order.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Rigorous analytic reconstruction of Molina's framework, making middle knowledge intelligible within contemporary modal semantics and metaphysics.
 - Careful attention to truthmakers for CCFs and to how God's deliberative act (choosing a feasible world) fits with classical divine simplicity and timelessness.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Thomistic physical-premotion accounts that posit intrinsic divine causation of free acts; offers Molinism as preserving libertarian contingency without diminishing divine sovereignty.
 - Responds to earlier Jesuit glosses by giving a more explicit metaphysical and semantic underpinning to Molina's often terse formulations.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Emphasis on the notion of a **feasible world** (worlds compatible with middle knowledge truths) and systematic use of modern counterfactual semantics to explicate Molina's intuitions.
 - Clarifies distinctions among natural, middle, and free knowledge in language congenial to analytic philosophers.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in contemporary philosophical theology and in evangelical/Catholic apologetics (notably through engagement by Craig and others).
 - Provoked renewed debates on the grounding objection; provided a standard reference for Molinist accounts of providence in late 20th-21st century scholarship.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a clear, teachable model reconciling freedom and foreknowledge; valuable as a conceptual pivot in courses on providence, divine knowledge, and theodicy.
 - Serves as a benchmark against which both Thomistic and Calvinist accounts of providence are contrasted.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Middle Knowledge** - God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance; logically intermediate between natural and free knowledge.
- **Natural Knowledge** - God's knowledge of necessary truths and of all possible powers, capacities, and the space of possibilities.
- **Free Knowledge** - God's knowledge of the actual world following His creative decree (what will actually occur).
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom (CCFs)** - Conditional propositions about what a free agent would do if placed in some circumstance; central content of middle knowledge.
- **Feasible World** - A possible world compatible with both the truths of CCFs and the liberty of creatures; the selection target of God's creative decree.
- **Grounding Objection** - The challenge asking what ontologically grounds the truth of CCFs prior to God's decree (brute facts, dispositions, or truths about possible worlds).
- **Divine Concurrence** - Doctrine of how God cooperates with secondary causes without overriding libertarian freedom; Flint explicates compatibility with Molinism.
- **Libertarian Freedom** - The view that human choices are genuinely undetermined and could have been otherwise; preserved by Molinist account.
- **Sovereign Decree / Creative Act** - God's free act of choosing which feasible world to actualize.
- **Omniscience / Divine Timelessness** - Attributes which Flint treats so as to avoid modal or temporal incoherence in middle knowledge.
- **Providential Ordering** - The resultant orchestration of events whereby God achieves purposes via free creatures.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Molinism and for explication of middle knowledge.
 - As a **polemic** against deterministic Tho­mistic/Calvinist accounts of providence.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** in discussions of election, grace, and theodicy where freedom and foreknowledge meet.
