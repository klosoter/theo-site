### TITLE
The New Testament as Canon - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (essay in Inerrancy and Hermeneutic, ed. Harvie Conn)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical/Reformed engagement with inerrancy, biblical authority, and historical-critical studies.
 - Situated within debates over the role of ecclesial tradition versus the Bible itself as norm; part of broader inerrancy-hermeneutic conversations in North American Protestantism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament possesses intrinsic canonical authority rooted in apostolic origin and divine inspiration; ecclesial recognition is witness, not origin, of that authority.
 - The canonical status determines how Scripture functions as normative in theology and church life (addresses both *Canon and Tradition* and *Inspiration and Inerrancy* concerns).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of historical processes of canon recognition → establishes apostolicity, widespread reception, and doctrinal consistency as historical indices.
 - Theological claim: once apostolicity and inspiration are established, the NT writings are self-authoritative by virtue of being divinely inspired; the church's act is declarative rather than constitutive.
 - Explains epistemic means: the Spirit's witness to the text and the church's reception interplay so that canon functions as the normative rule (regulative) for faith and practice.
 - Hermeneutical implication: reading must honor the canonical shape and apostolic intentions; inerrancy follows from inspiration and canonical authority and constrains interpretation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary evangelical inerrantists and critics of inerrancy; interacts with canonical-criticism voices (e.g., Brevard S. Childs-type emphases) and with Roman Catholic appeals to tradition/magisterium.
 - Draws on historical patristic reception and Reformed tradition (Vosian and Westminster emphases implicit).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy, authority, canon, ecclesiology (role of church in recognition), and hermeneutics. Secondary implications for Christology and covenantal reading of Scripture.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The New Testament is canonically normative because it is apostolic and divinely inspired; the church recognizes but does not originate that authority, and the Spirit-witnessed text is the decisive rule for doctrine and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strongly stresses *recognition* rather than *creation* of canonical authority: the church's role is declarative, not constitutive.
 - Integrates a pneumatic epistemology (Spirit's witness) with historical-apostolic criteria to ground canonical status.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic magisterial claims that tradition/magisterium confer authority; opposes any model that subordinates the NT canon to ecclesial fiat.
 - Distinguishes from radical historical-critical positions that reduce canon to sociological development; insists on theological grounding (inspiration/inerrancy).
 - Nuances some canonical-criticism approaches (e.g., purely canonical-function accounts) by retaining robust doctrine of inspiration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the interplay of *self-attestation* (text's internal claim, realized by Spirit) and *reception history* as complementary, not competing, criteria.
 - Uses "recognition-as-witness" language to describe ecclesial acts with theological precision.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in Reformed evangelical circles for clarifying how canonicity relates to inerrancy and ecclesial authority.
 - Used by conservative seminaries to defend sola scriptura while engaging canonical criticism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, theologically careful model for grounding canonical authority without capitulating to magisterial or skeptical alternatives.
 - Valuable for courses on canon, hermeneutics, and Protestant doctrines of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canonical Authority**
 - The binding, normative status of NT writings for doctrine and life; derived from apostolicity and inspiration, recognized by the church.
- **Apostolicity**
 - Historical criterion for canonicity: connection to apostles (authorship, commission, teaching).
- **Inspiration**
 - Divine origination of Scripture; Gaffin treats inspiration as the ground for normative and inerrant claims.
- **Inerrancy**
 - Corollary of inspiration once canonical status is established; Scripture trustworthy and without error in its intended assertions.
- **Recognition (vs. Constitutive)**
 - Key distinction: the church recognizes the NT canon rather than creates it; recognition is the ecclesial acknowledgment of a prior divine act.
- **Spirit-Witness / Pneumatic Epistemology**
 - The Holy Spirit enables the church to discern and receive the canonical writings as God's Word; not a private proof but corporate and normative.
- **Self-Attestation**
 - The claim that Scripture, by its divine origin and Spirit-enabled reception, bears its own authority rather than requiring external validation.
- **Reception History (Ecclesial Reception)**
 - The historical process and practice by which the church received particular books; used as evidential, not constitutive, for canon.
- **Hermeneutical Normativity**
 - The canonical shape of Scripture governs interpretation; canonical context and apostolic intent constrain hermeneutical method.
- **Regulative Principle of Scripture (implicit)**
 - Scriptural normativity regulates doctrine and worship; Gaffin's model supports a strong regulative posture.
- **Tradition (ecclesial)**
 - Distinguished from Scripture: legitimate as witness and guide but subordinate to the canonical Word.
- **Covenantal Reading**
 - Reading that respects redemptive-historical and apostolic continuity shaping NT interpretation.
- **Self-Authenticating Text**
 - Phrase describing how divinely inspired Scripture, when apostolic credentials are present and the Spirit testifies, functions as its own authority.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for canonical authority in Reformed confessional teaching.
- As a **polemic** against magisterial tradition and purely sociological accounts of canon formation.
- As an **exegetical/ hermeneutical model** that links apostolic origin, inspiration, and Spirit-witness to practical rules for reading the NT.
