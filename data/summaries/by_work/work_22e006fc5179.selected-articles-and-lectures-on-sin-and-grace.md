### TITLE
Selected Articles and Lectures on Sin and Grace - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th century Protestant milieu (largely 1910s-1930s). Machen writes amid Princeton/Presbyterian controversies: rise of theological liberalism/modernism, debates over biblical authority, and ecclesiastical conflicts that produced Westminster Theological Seminary (1929) and later conservative Presbyterian realignments.
 - Audience: clergy, seminary students, educated laity seeking defense of historic Reformed doctrine against both modernist dilution and more optimistic anthropologies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature is radically corrupted by sin and cannot initiate saving relation to God; salvation is the work of sovereign, prevenient and effectual divine grace. Rejection of Pelagian and semi‑Pelagian attempts to locate saving initiative in fallen humanity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: careful historical and biblical exposition of the doctrine of sin - original sin, hereditary guilt, total depravity.
 - Polemic: systematic rebuttal of Pelagianism and Semi‑Pelagianism (and of contemporary Arminian twists), showing their inconsistency with Scripture and church tradition.
 - Positive construction: articulation and defense of Augustinian/Calvinistic positions - monergistic regeneration, sovereign election, necessity of supernatural grace for faith and repentance.
 - Practical implications: pastoral consequences for preaching, assurance, evangelism, and ecclesial discipline; critique of moralism and moral reform as substitutes for conversion.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: Augustine (as theological model), Pelagius and the semi‑Pelagian tradition, classical Reformers (Calvin, Augustine through Reformation readings).
 - Contemporary: theological liberals/modernists, parts of the Arminian tradition and Wesleyan thought, and some Presbyterian moderates who compromised on original sin and authority of Scripture.
 - Primary texts: biblical exegesis (Pauline theodicy), patristic sources, Reformation confessions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin (original sin, total depravity, guilt, inherited corruption)
 - Grace (prevenient, effectual, sovereign, irresistible in Machen's framing)
 - Salvation (regeneration, justification, faith as gift)
 - Secondary engagement: ecclesiology (authority, discipline), preaching and pastoral care.

- **Closing line**
 - Machen centers theology on the necessity of sovereign grace against any anthropology that would make salvation ultimately depend on human initiative: Scripture and tradition compel an Augustinian, monergistic soteriology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Combines rigorous historical theology (Augustine as authoritative precedent) with robust pastoral concern: sin is both doctrinally opposed and pastorally confronted.
 - Emphasis on the scandal of grace - salvation as undeserved, divine action that upends moral self‑confidence.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Sharp correction of Pelagian optimism and semi‑Pelagian compromise: Machen insists that any doctrine granting fallen humanity effective initiating power undermines the gospel and Scripture.
 - Critiques of liberal theology: rejects ethical or cultural religion as substitute for substantive, transformative grace.

- **Conceptual/terminological notes**
 - Reaffirms traditional terms (total depravity, monergism, imputation) while insisting on clarity and pastoral application rather than abstract system building alone.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential among conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles in the Anglo‑American world; contributed to seminary formation (Westminster) and denominational realignments.
 - Used widely as artillery in 20th‑century anti‑modernist and anti‑Arminian polemics; less reception in liberal or ecumenical quarters.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise bridge between patristic/Augustinian tradition and 20th‑century Reformed defense; valuable for teaching doctrine of sin and grace, for polemical clarity, and for pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism**
 - Denies original guilt and asserts human ability to choose good without divine aid; Machen refutes as inconsistent with biblical anthropology.

- **Semi‑Pelagianism**
 - Allows a human initial move toward God (prevenient initiative) but requires subsequent grace; Machen treats it as an insidious compromise that preserves human merit.

- **Augustinianism**
 - Emphasis on original sin, divine sovereignty in election and regeneration; Machen adopts this as the confessional baseline.

- **Original sin**
 - Hereditary corruption and guilt transmitted to all humanity; foundational for Machen's argument about human inability.

- **Total depravity**
 - Every part of human nature affected by sin; used to deny any purely natural saving capacity.

- **Sovereign grace**
 - God as the initiator and completer of salvation; grace is efficacious, not merely permissive.

- **Monergism**
 - Regeneration as God's sole work, not cooperative; Machen employs the term functionally to oppose synergistic systems.

- **Synergism**
 - Human cooperation in salvation; critiqued as theologically untenable and pastorally dangerous.

- **Imputation**
 - Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness and/or Adam's guilt in soteriological accounting; used to ground justification.

- **Prevenient grace (rejected in Machen's weaker forms)**
 - Grace that merely enables a human response; Machen objects when it makes human will the decisive factor.

- **Penal substitution (adjacent)**
 - Christ bears penalty for sinners; often presupposed within Machen's soteriology though primary focus remains on sin/grace dynamics.

- **Antimodernism / Biblical authority**
 - Defense of Scripture's normative role against liberal reinterpretation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed positions on original sin, total depravity, and monergistic grace.
- As a **polemic** against Pelagian, semi‑Pelagian, Arminian, and modernist tendencies.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** linking patristic Augustine and Reformation orthodoxy to 20th‑century confessional theology.
- As a **pedagogical and pastoral resource** for preaching on sin, the need for grace, and assurance.
