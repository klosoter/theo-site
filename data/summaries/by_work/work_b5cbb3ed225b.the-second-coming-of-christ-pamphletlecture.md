### TITLE
The Second Coming of Christ (pamphlet/lecture) - Louis Berkhof

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Reformed seminary milieu; Berkhof writes as a compact, pastoral-theological treatment aimed at students and pastors within the Dutch Reformed tradition in North America.
 - Responds to rising popular dispensational premillennialism and speculative end-time chronologies common in his day.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The return of Christ is a single, personal, visible, bodily Parousia that will consummate redemption, raise the dead, and execute final judgment; it is imminent yet preceded by apostasy and the revelation of lawless opposition.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundations: careful reading of key New Testament texts (esp. 1 Thess 4-5, 2 Thess 2, 1 John, and the Apocalypse) to establish the character and effects of the Second Coming.
 - Polemical moves:
 - Rejects a secret, two-stage rapture separate from the visible return of Christ.
 - Refutes undue fascination with precise timetables and sensational prophetic schemes.
 - Eschatological consequences: Christ's return effects resurrection, final judgment, consummation of the kingdom, and the end of all evil powers (including Antichrist/man of lawlessness).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: New Testament authors (Paul, John, Revelation).
 - Interlocutors: Church Fathers and Reformers (Augustine, Calvin) implicitly as tradition; explicit polemic against dispensationalists (Darby, Scofield-style readings).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (nature and personal return of the risen Christ), eschatology (resurrection, judgment, millennium), ecclesiology (church's vocation in the meantime), revelation (hermeneutics of prophetic Scripture).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Second Coming is the decisive, public completion of Christ's redemptive work - an event that summons watchful holiness, confident hope, and measured exegesis rather than speculation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Clear insistence on a single, visible Parousia**
 - Emphasizes unity of "coming" events (no secret pre-trib rapture); the return is bodily and public.
- **Balanced treatment of Antichrist / man of lawlessness**
 - Reads these figures as both present realities (a recurring spirit of opposition) and as culminating personal manifestations before the end - resisting both overly narrow identifications and unchecked futurism.
- **Covenantal/Reformed hermeneutic**
 - Interprets prophetic texts within redemptive-historical continuity instead of repeatedly reapplying Israel-only categories or isolating dispensational epochs.
- **Pastoral sobriety against sensationalism**
 - Prioritizes pastoral admonition (watchfulness, perseverance) over curiosity about dates and signs.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicitly counters dispensational premillennial chronology and the notion of a secret rapture; distances from speculative date-setting.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in mid-20th-century Reformed teaching as a concise corrective to popular dispensationalism; valued for clarity though not a systematic or exhaustive treatment.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, biblically-rooted primer that models a Reformed approach to eschatology: cautious, Christ-centered, pastorally oriented.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia (Second Coming)**
 - The personal, visible, and bodily return of Christ to consummate history.
- **Imminence**
 - The teaching that Christ may come at any moment; cautions against pinpointing dates.
- **Resurrection of the dead**
 - Bodily raising at Christ's coming; central to Berkhof's consummation.
- **Final Judgment**
 - Public tribunals where Christ renders final justice, coincident with the Parousia.
- **Millennium**
 - Read in continuity with the present age (Reformed/amillennial contours), not as a literal future 1,000-year earthly reign separated by dispensations.
- **Tribulation / Day of the Lord**
 - Periods of intensified suffering/judgment associated with end-time events; treated with restraint against sensational timelines.
- **Antichrist**
 - Broad term for the spirit and agents opposing Christ; includes multiple antichrists across church history and a culminating manifestation.
 - Relation to the Man of Lawlessness: the Antichrist concept is wider; the Man of Lawlessness is the specific, climactic person revealed before Christ's return.
- **Man of Lawlessness (man of sin)**
 - The end-time, lawless opposer revealed before the Parousia; a final apostasy and deception that prepares the way for judgment.
- **Secret rapture**
 - Rejected; Berkhof argues no biblical warrant for a private removal of the church preceding the visible return.
- **Signs of the times**
 - Indicators described in Scripture but not reliable for fixing dates; function to admonish readiness.
- **Kingdom consummation**
 - The final realization of God's reign in full - eschatological goal of the Second Coming.
- **Hermeneutical stance**
 - Covenantal, Christ-centered exegesis; resists atomized prophetic literalism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed eschatology (concise statements on Parousia, imminence, and rejection of secret rapture).
- As a **polemic** against dispensational premillennialism and sensational prophetic speculation.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and Johannine eschatology in a redemptive-historical framework; a pastoral handbook for preaching the hope of Christ's return.
