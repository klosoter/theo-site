### TITLE
**"The Trinity and Van Til: An Analysis and Critique" - Robert Letham, in Cornelius Van Til: Reformed Apologist and Churchman (eds. John R. Muether & Greg L. Bahnsen, 1999).** 
Concise critical engagement with Cornelius Van Til's theological language about the Godhead, especially his deployment of what Letham calls Van Til's **"one-person language."** Letham assesses theological, biblical, and apologetic implications and defends classical Trinitarian categories against perceived distortions.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed apologetic milieu: conversation between classical Reformed orthodoxy and Van Tilian presuppositionalism.
 - Volume devoted to Van Til as apologist and churchman; Letham writes as a historically informed Trinitarian theologian assessing Van Til's constructive innovations.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til's rhetorical and conceptual moves - notably a tendency to prioritize divine unity in language that can lapse into "one-person" expressions - risk undermining orthodox Trinitarian distinctions (three persons, one essence).
 - Letham contends that while Van Til's apologetic aims are legitimate, some of his Trinitarian terminology and metaphysical presuppositions are theologically precarious and require correction.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: identifies patterns in Van Til's writings where the unity of God is stressed in a way that downplays personal distinctions.
 - Exegetical-theological correction: rehearses classical biblical and creedal categories (Nicene-Constantinopolitan standards, immanent vs. economic Trinity, person/ousia distinctions).
 - Apologetic consequences: argues that muddled Trinitarian doctrine produces vulnerabilities in doctrine and practice, including Christology and revelation.
 - Reconstructive proposals: recommends precise categorical language (three persons, one essence; relationality, perichoresis) and the safeguarding role of creedal formulations for theological and apologetic work.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Cornelius Van Til (writings, lectures, apologetic formulations).
 - Secondary touchpoints: classical patristic and scholastic sources (e.g., Augustine, Athanasius), Reformed theologians and creeds, contemporary defenders of Van Til (e.g., Bahnsen) implicitly engaged.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), with implications for revelation (how God is known), Christology (person of Christ), and apologology (presuppositional method).
- **Closing line**
 - Letham affirms Van Til's apologetic zeal but insists that fidelity to classical Trinitarian categories is necessary to preserve biblical doctrine and avoid conceptual error.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the methodological necessity of precise Trinitarian terminology for both theology and apologetics; not merely a matter of semantics but of doctrinal integrity.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts Van Til's rhetorical unity-language with the church's language of **three persons** and one divine **essence**, arguing the latter better secures orthodox commitments.
 - Challenges any implicit modalistic tendencies without dismissing Van Til's anti-reductionism regarding divine simplicity and unity.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Letham does not propose a novel doctrine but reframes Van Tilian concerns within classical categories, showing how Reformed presuppositionalism can be held within creedal Trinitarianism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable in Reformed circles as a tempering corrective to enthusiastic Van Tilian rhetoric; cited by students and teachers wanting to integrate robust Trinitarian theology with presuppositional apologetics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a model of how to critique a leading figure from within the tradition: appreciative yet rigorous, defending creedal boundaries while acknowledging apologetic contributions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-person language** - Letham's label for Van Til's tendency to emphasize divine unity in ways that can obscure personal plurality; focal critique of the essay.
- **Person / ousia distinction** - Classical categories Letham urges to recover: three persons (hypostases) in one divine essence (ousia).
- **Immanent vs. economic Trinity** - Distinction deployed to guard against conflating God's internal relations with God's redemptive acts; used to show proper levels of theological talk.
- **Perichoresis / relationality** - Affirms mutual indwelling and real relations among the persons as essential for orthodox Trinitarian language.
- **Modalism / modalistic risk** - The error Letham fears; he argues Van Til's rhetoric occasionally treads near this by overemphasizing unity.
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - Van Til's method; Letham respects its apologetic force but critiques its theological expression when it compromises Trinitarian terminology.
- **Analogy / analogical knowledge** - Letham insists on careful analogical speech about God grounded in revelation and creedal formulae.
- **Creedal safeguarding** - Use of Nicene-Constantinopolitan formulations as corrective norms against terminological drift.
- **Revelation-centered epistemology** - Shared ground: both Van Til and Letham insist God is known only by divine self-revelation, but differ on terminological safeguards.
- **Christological implication** - How Trinitarian talk bears on the person and work of Christ; For Letham, muddied Trinitarian language risks Christological confusion.
- **Doctrinal grammar** - The idea that specific theological terms function as grammar for correct theological reasoning; Letham emphasizes this corrective role.
- **Polemic balance** - Letham models a balance of critique and appreciation; polemical where necessary, constructive otherwise.

How this work is used:
- As a **polemic** when defending classical Trinitarian formulae against modern Van Tilian readings. 
- As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating presuppositional apologetics into creedal Trinitarian theology without sacrificing orthodox categories.
