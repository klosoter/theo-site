### TITLE
**Science and Faith: Friends or Foes? (2003) - Jack Collins**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early-21st-century evangelical engagement with science; published amid high-profile public debates over evolution, intelligent design, and young-earth creationism.
 - Collins writes from a Reformed evangelical academic posture (Old Testament scholar), aiming to equip pastors, students, and laypersons to navigate science-theology tensions responsibly.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Science and Christian faith need not be enemies; when properly understood in their own domains and with disciplined hermeneutics, they are mutually intelligible and mutually corrective.
 - The theological problem: how to maintain biblical convictions (creation, Fall, human uniqueness, covenantal consequences) while taking scientific evidence seriously.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnosis of the conflict model: both scientism (science as ultimate authority) and literalist anti-science readings of Scripture are rejected.
 - Methodological proposal: adopt disciplined methodological naturalism for science and robust biblical exegesis for theology; allow interaction without conflation.
 - Application to biblical doctrines:
 - Genesis 1-3: offers hermeneutical options (literal 24-hour days, day-age, framework, literary reading) and argues theological commitments (God as Creator, special creation of humanity) should not be surrendered.
 - Adam and sin: defends the theological necessity of a historical Adam as federal representative while allowing some latitude about the scientific models for human origins.
 - Pastoral and apologetic orientation: equip Christians to engage culture, critique both extreme literalists and antitheistic science, and steward theological doctrines that bear on salvation and covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages scientific naturalists and popular atheists (as targets of apologetic responses), mainstream evolutionary biology as methodological backdrop, and a range of evangelical positions (young-earth creationists, old-earth/compromiser positions, and theistic evolution advocates).
 - Dialogues with philosophical approaches to religion/science relations (e.g., non-overlapping magisteria implicitly invoked) and with contemporary evangelical exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs. general), creation (creatio ex nihilo, temporal framework), anthropology (image of God), sin and the Fall, and covenantal/federal theology (Adam as federal head).
- **Closing line**
 - Collins aims to hold together faithful biblical theology (notably the historicity and federal significance of Adam) and intellectual integrity before the sciences, advocating a humble, disciplined, and pastoral middle way.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong Reformed focus on the covenantal and federal repercussions of Genesis: Adam is not merely an organism but a covenantal representative whose historicity matters for sin, guilt, and promise.
 - Emphasis on methodological partitioning: science's methods are proper to natural causes; theology's truths derive from Scripture and covenantal categories.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Critiques both scientistic atheists (for reducing theological claims) and extreme young-earth literalists (for importing scientific claims into biblical exegesis).
 - Opposes naive concordism (forcing Scripture to mirror contemporary scientific accounts) while also resisting capitulation to scientism that undermines core doctrines (e.g., original sin).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Advocates a pragmatic "friends-not-foes" model that frames theology-science exchange as disciplined conversation rather than war.
 - Frames historicity of Adam principally as a theological-pastoral necessity, not solely a scientific hypothesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in evangelical and Reformed circles as a moderate, pastoral corrective to polarizing rhetoric; used in seminary classrooms and church training.
 - Cited by later conservative scholars as a resource for maintaining doctrinal integrity while engaging scientific perspectives.
- **Enduring value**
 - Balanced methodology for pastors and students; a durable exemplar of integrating careful exegesis with respect for scientific practice, especially on Adam and creation-day debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Methodological naturalism** - endorsed as the operational rule for science; not a metaphysical denial of God.
- **Concordism** - critiqued; Collins warns against forcing biblical texts to answer modern scientific minutiae.
- **Non-confrontational model ("friends-not-foes")** - Collins' descriptive posture for faith-science relations.
- **Historical Adam** - defended on theological and covenantal grounds as necessary for federal headship and the doctrine of original sin; held as non-negotiable theologically even if scientific models vary.
 - Relation to Federal Headship: Adam's historical agency grounds imputation of sin and covenantal consequences in Reformed theology.
- **Federal headship** - emphasized as central to soteriological and covenantal thinking; Collins links exegetical readings of Genesis to this doctrine.
- **Days of creation** - treated as an interpretive locus with multiple viable readings (literal 24-hour, day-age, framework); Collins insists exegetical and theological commitments must drive interpretation, not premature scientific claims.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - affirmed as constitutive of human uniqueness and moral responsibility; theological anchor against reductive naturalism.
- **Accommodation** - used cautiously: Scripture may accommodate ancient cosmological language without forfeiting theological truth.
- **Revelation: special/general** - both are necessary: general revelation informs natural theology/scientific inquiry; special revelation governs redemptive doctrine.
- **Hermeneutical humility** - methodological stance toward both Scripture and science; encourages restraint and charity.
- **Progressive/old-earth notions** - discussed as plausible frameworks; Collins rejects dogmatic imposition of any single scientific model on doctrine.
- **Two-books model** - Scripture and creation as complementary sources of truth, properly read within their domains.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a moderate evangelical approach to faith-science relations (useful in courses introducing the debate).
- As a **polemic** against both scientism and extreme literalism (resources for pastoral counseling and apologetics).
- As an **exegetical model** on Genesis 1-3 that privileges theological commitments (historicity of Adam, federal headship) while permitting interpretive flexibility about "days of creation."
