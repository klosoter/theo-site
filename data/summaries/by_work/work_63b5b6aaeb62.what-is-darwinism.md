### TITLE
What is Darwinism? - Charles Hodge (Princeton Theology critique of Darwinian theory and metaphysical naturalism)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-19th century American Presbyterian environment; Princeton Seminary's conservative Reformed milieu reacting to rise of evolutionary theory and scientific naturalism.
 - Published as a sustained theological and philosophical review of Darwinian claims and their implications for Christian doctrine.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Darwinian mechanism (natural selection) as a scientific hypothesis must be distinguished from **Darwinism as a metaphysical system (materialism)**; the latter conflicts decisively with Christianity.
 - The theological crisis is not Darwinian science per se but the philosophical conclusions drawn beyond empirical warrant.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define Darwinism: separate empirical claims (common descent, variation, selection) from metaphysical inferences (denial of design, reduction of mind to matter).
 - Argue limits of scientific method: empirical generalization cannot validly overturn metaphysical first principles (e.g., moral consciousness, teleology).
 - Defend theological commitments: special creation of rational beings, providence, and revelation remain coherent and epistemically defensible.
 - Show that an exclusively naturalistic reading of origins is self-undermining (if mind is merely product of blind processes, the trustworthiness of reason is threatened).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Darwin and popularizers (Huxley, Haeckel) and philosophical materialists. Interacts with scientific authorities on geology and natural history; implicitly converses with conservative exegetes on Genesis.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (authority of Genesis narratives; limits on scientific reduction of text) [Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11].
 - **Creation and Providence** (special creation of rational soul; God's sustaining governance).
 - **Anthropology and Imago Dei** (human distinctiveness against reductive descent models).
 - **Epistemology** (criteria for knowledge of God and the reliability of reason) [Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God].
- **Closing line**
 - Hodge's theological center: preserve the epistemic and moral primacy of revelation and rational consciousness against the encroachment of philosophical materialism masquerading as science.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigid methodological distinction: permit empirical investigation but deny its competence to dictate metaphysical conclusions about meaning, purpose, or moral truths.
 - Stress that theology begins with **first principles** (God, moral law, revealed truth) that shape interpretation of scientific claims.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Countered the contemporaneous slide from empirical Darwinian hypotheses to wholesale naturalistic philosophy (Huxley/Tyndall) - insists critics conflate theory and ideology.
 - More willing than some to allow natural explanations for biological diversity while denying their sufficiency to dethrone supernatural explanation for human mind and moral order.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear articulation of the distinction: **"Darwinism" (empirical hypothesis) vs. "Darwinism" (philosophical materialism)** - a model for later theologians addressing science.
 - Foreshadows presuppositional concerns: epistemic circularity if reason is treated as purely product of nonrational forces.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in late-19th and early-20th-century conservative Reformed circles; shaped Princeton responses and pastoral apologetics.
 - Criticized by scientific naturalists as obstructionist; later historians see Hodge as providing a principled, not merely reactionary, theological critique.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as an early exemplar of disciplined theological engagement with science: insists on boundary carefulness, provides a vocabulary for distinguishing descriptive science from prescriptive metaphysics, and preserves theological claims about human uniqueness and revelation for subsequent debates (e.g., in Genesis interpretation and theology of knowledge) [Days Of Creation; Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11; Nature And Task Of Theology].

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Darwinism (empirical sense)** - natural selection and common descent as scientific hypotheses; Hodge treats these as potentially true scientific propositions but limited in scope.
- **Darwinism (philosophical/materialist sense)** - the metaphysical claim that life, mind, and moral values are wholly explicable without design or supernatural causality; Hodge rejects this.
- **Materialism** - philosophical doctrine reducing mind and moral law to matter; the primary antagonist in Hodge's argument.
- **Special creation** - the theological claim (esp. for rational souls) that God directly causes certain realities; defended against reduction.
- **Revelation** - authoritative divine self-disclosure (including Genesis) that sets bounds on speculative naturalistic readings [Science And Scripture Genesis 1 11].
- **Reason / rationality** - treated as epistemically basic and not adequately explained by blind natural processes; used to argue for the reliability of theological knowledge [Epistemology And The Knowledge Of God].
- **First principles** - foundational presuppositions (existence of God, moral law) that govern both theology and interpretation of science [Nature And Task Of Theology].
- **Teleology** - the doctrine of purposive order in nature; Hodge insists teleological judgments are not thereby illegitimate when warranted.
- **Providence** - God's ongoing governance that can coexist with secondary causes (scientific explanation) without being eliminated.
- **Genesis 1-11 / Days of Creation** - Hodge defends the theological import of these chapters against reductive allegorization; cautious about overly literalistic or purely mythic readings (Days Of Creation).
- **Science vs. Metaphysics** - recurring technical distinction: empirical method is descriptive; metaphysical assertions require philosophical justification.
- **Moral consciousness** - human awareness of moral law used as a proof against reductionist origins of reason and ethics.
- **Epistemic self‑undermining** - argument that materialism undercuts the trustworthiness of human reason (central polemic move).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for distinguishing empirical Darwinian theory from philosophical Darwinism.
 - As a **polemic resource** in apologetics against naturalistic reductions of theology and ethics.
 - As an **exegetical model** for conservative readings of Genesis that nonetheless engage scientific discussion.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions of theological method and the limits of scientific inference in theology.
