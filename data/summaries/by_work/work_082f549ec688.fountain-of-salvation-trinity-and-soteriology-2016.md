### TITLE
**Fountain of Salvation: Trinity and Soteriology (Fred Sanders, 2016)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-2010s theological landscape: renewed attention to the relation between Trinitarian doctrine and soteriology amid debates over gender, authority, and intra-Trinitarian order.
 - Sanders writes from an orthodox, historically-informed evangelical perspective, engaging patristic, medieval, and contemporary sources.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Trinity is the fountain of salvation: the Father as source, the Son as the incarnate fountain through whom saving life flows, and the Spirit as the life-giver who applies salvation. Properly understood Trinitarian relations preserve divine unity and equality while accounting for economic order in redemption.
 - Opposes readings that infer eternal subordination of the Son's will or authority from economic roles.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of biblical and patristic imagery of fountains, streams, and sources as the shape of God's giving life and salvation.
 - Theological move: translate economic descriptions (what God does in salvation) into correct statements about the immanent Trinity without collapsing order into hierarchy.
 - Emphasizes **relations of origin** (eternal generation, spiration) as the classical resource to explain asymmetry without inferiority.
 - Argues that fountain-imagery supplies an ontological picture of how divine life is both one and personally ordered.
 - Polemic against contemporary Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS) readings that make economic role imply eternal functional hierarchy.
 - Practical implications for soteriology: how union with Christ, justification, sanctification, and the Spirit's application are grounded in Trinitarian fountain-dynamics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic and medieval witnesses (e.g., Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine, Cappadocians, scholastic appropriations).
 - Contemporary interlocutors in the EFS debates (notably proponents who read economic order as eternal functional subordination).
 - Scriptural exegesis across OT/NT fountain imagery and Johannine pneumatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent and economic), Christology (incarnation as the Son's fountainal self-giving), Pneumatology (Spirit as giver/applicator), soteriology (union, impartation, application of redemption), perichoresis, relations of origin (eternal generation, spiration).

- **Closing line**
 - Sanders's center of gravity: the **Trinitarian fountain** motif secures a non-hierarchical asymmetry-ordered personal relations that ground salvation without compromising divine equality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Makes the **fountain** metaphor central, not merely decorative: it is the primary theological image linking intra-Trinitarian relations to soteriological economy.
 - Prioritizes historical categories of **relations of origin** (generation/spiration) to guard against conflating economic role with ontological subordination.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects EFS-style readings that derive permanent functional authority structures within the Godhead from economic roles.
 - Contrasts utilitarian or role-based models with a metaphysical account rooted in ancient doctrine (eternal relations), thereby rejecting both subordinateism and flattening of distinction.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Reframes soteriology as emanating from a **fountainal Trinity**-anonymizes no person but locates directional flow without ranking.
 - Clarifies the vocabulary of **order vs. inferiority**: order (ordering of wills/actions) does not equal ontological subordination.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively among those seeking a robust Trinitarian foundation for evangelical soteriology; used in debates to push back against EFS claims.
 - Increasingly cited in seminars on Trinity and soteriology; influential in encouraging recovery of patristic imagery in contemporary systematic theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, accessible model for integrating classical Trinitarian doctrine with concrete soteriological concerns; useful for teaching and for theological polemics that require careful historical-theological backing.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fountain of Salvation** - central image: God as source; salvation flows from Father through Son by Spirit.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's works in salvation history (what God does); primary place to observe fountain imagery.
- **Immanent Trinity** - the inner being and relations of God; explained via relations of origin to avoid EFS pitfalls.
- **Relations of Origin** - eternal generation (Father -> Son) and spiration (Father + Son -> Spirit); ontological asymmetries that do not imply inferiority.
- **Eternal Generation** - classical doctrine used to ground the Son's origin without suggesting createdness or subordination.
- **Eternal Spiration (Procession)** - doctrine locating the Spirit's origin and role as the Spirit who applies and communicates the fountainal life.
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - contemporary proposal that Sanders critiques; he resists reading economic order as constituting eternal subordination of will/authority.
- **Perichoresis** - mutual indwelling; Sanders uses it to affirm shared life and action without erasing personal distinctions.
- **Ordered Asymmetry** - the idea of directionality in relations and operations that preserves ontological equality.
- **Appropriation (divine)** - assigning activities appropriately to persons (e.g., Son's ransom, Spirit's application) within the fountain motif.
- **Soteriological Flow** - shorthand for how salvation is traced from Father-source, through the Son's incarnate work, by the Spirit's application.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "fountain" as a theological category linking Trinity and soteriology.
 - As a **polemic** against EFS readings that posit eternal authority-subordination.
 - As an **exegetical-model** showing how biblical fountain motifs can inform systematic claims about relations of origin.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses or papers that seek a historically rooted, non-hierarchical account of Trinitarian economy.
