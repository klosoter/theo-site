### TITLE
John R. Betz & David Bentley Hart, eds., Erich Przywara, S.J.: His Theology and His World (2014) - Major secondary on Erich Przywara (primary author: Erich Przywara)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2014; collects essays situating Przywara (1889-1972), a Jesuit Thomist and metaphysical theologian, within 20th-century Catholic thought and the modern philosophical milieu (Kantianism, neo-Scholasticism, early phenomenology).
 - Aimed at reassessing Przywara's influence between classical Thomism and contemporary theological problems; written for theologians engaging postwar debates (Barth vs. Catholic thinkers).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The volume reframes Przywara as a formative figure whose robust doctrine of analogy (analogia entis) offers a constructive Catholic response to both modern immanence and Barthian criticisms that privilege analogia fidei.
 - It asks whether Przywara's metaphysical analogies legitimate natural knowledge of God without collapsing revelation into natural theology.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical-theological recovery: biographical orientation, intellectual genealogy, institutional context.
 - Thematic essays: method (metaphysical vs. dialectical), doctrine of analogy, Trinity and Christology, sacrament and ecclesiology, aesthetics and theological imagination.
 - Critical engagement: contrasts Przywara to Aquinas, Barth, Rahner, and modern philosophers; evaluates strengths and limits of his analogical ontology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Thomas Aquinas, Augustine; critical contrasts with Karl Barth (analogIa fidei), contemporary Thomists, and modern philosophers influencing theological method.
 - Editors and contributors draw on primary Przywara texts and letters, and secondary conversation partners like Rahner and Balthasar.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and natural theology, Trinity, Christology (Incarnation and hypostatic union), creation and participation, grace, ecclesiology and sacraments, theological method (analogy, metaphor, ontology).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Przywara's theology centers on a metaphysical analogia entis that preserves a derivative, participatory knowledge of God-holding transcendence and intelligibility together as the core Catholic rejoinder to both secular immanence and strict analogia fidei readings.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong ontological reading of analogy: being as the formal locus of comparison between Creator and creature rather than purely predicative or propositional analogy.
 - Dynamic "participation" language: creatures reflect God's being in degrees, enabling theological knowledge without identity.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back on Barthian skepticism toward natural theology by arguing analogy need not produce an autonomous natural theology; it grounds openness to revelation.
 - Reinterprets Thomistic analogia as a metaphysical and relational ontology, not merely a scholastic semantic device.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Tightening of "analogia entis" as theological-ontological structure (vs. mere linguistic analogy).
 - Framing of analogy in a rhythm or relational dynamic-God-world correlation that is both asymmetrical and genuinely participatory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Historically contested: read warily in Protestant circles dominated by Barth; more positively reclaimed in some Catholic theological renewal streams (Balthasar, later Thomists).
 - The volume advances renewed scholarly interest, situating Przywara as a resource for ecumenical and metaphysical theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Offers a rich resource for courses on analogy, natural theology, and 20th-century Catholic thought; useful as a corrective to flattened caricatures of analogia entis and as a bridge for dialogue with Barthian and Reformed concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)**
 - For Przywara: an ontological-structural relation where created being participates in, and therefore analogically communicates, the being of God.
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)**
 - Barthian corrective emphasizing that true analogies are governed by revelation; the volume frames this as a central interlocutor for Przywara.
- **Analogy (general)**
 - Not merely linguistic similarity but metaphysical correspondence enabling theological predication.
- **Participation**
 - Creatures partake in divine being; key to avoiding univocity while permitting genuinely referential talk of God.
- **Transcendence vs. immanence**
 - Przywara's balance: preserves God's absolute transcendence while affirming intelligible traces of God in creation.
- **Natural theology**
 - Reassessed: Przywara permits disciplined natural knowledge rooted in analogy but keeps it subordinate to revelation.
- **Theological ontology**
 - Fusion of metaphysics and theology; ontology becomes theological when oriented to Creator-creature relation.
- **Revelation**
 - Remains decisive; analogy prepares and disposes but does not replace divine self-manifestation.
- **Christology (incarnation and analogy)**
 - Incarnation exemplifies analogical participation-God's self-communication preserves divine difference while achieving real union.
- **Method: metaphysical vs. dialectical**
 - Przywara leans metaphysical (ontology, participation) while engaging dialectical critics who stress revelation's priority.
- **Analogia vs. univocity**
 - Defends non-univocal predication of God's attributes while affirming meaningful predication across Creator/creature divide.
- **Sacramentality**
 - Material signs as analogical mediations of divine reality; sacrament theology tied to ontology of participation.
- **Modern philosophy engagement**
 - Uses Thomistic categories to read and respond to Kantian limits and 20th-century critiques of metaphysics.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source for contemporary accounts of **analogia entis** in modern Catholic theology.
 - Polemical resource in debates with **analogIa fidei** advocates (Barthian tradition) over natural theology's legitimacy.
 - Exegetical-model resource for reading Aquinas and Augustine through a 20th-century metaphysical lens; conceptual pivot for ecumenical dialogue on analogy.
