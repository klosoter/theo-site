### TITLE
The Westminster Confession of Faith (as a confessional context for Turretin's covenantal views) - Francis Turretin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 17th-century Reformed scholastic milieu; Westminster Confession (1646) sets confessional framework for British and later Protestant Reformed churches.
 - Turretin (1623-1687), Geneva-based Reformed scholastic, writes Institutes of Elenctic Theology (post-WCF) as a systematic, polemical, and scholastic defense of orthodox Reformed doctrine.
 - Movement: post-Calvinian orthodoxy reacting to Arminianism, Socinianism, Amyraldian modifications, and Roman Catholic polemics.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Show how Turretin interprets and sharpens Westminster confessional covenantal formulations: the coherence of divine decrees, the covenantal relationship between God and humanity (works and grace), and the mediatorial role of Christ grounded in the hypostatic union.
 - Key problem: preserve WCF Chalcedonian and covenantal orthodoxy while answering heterodox alternatives (Amyraut, Arminianism, Socinianism) and clarifying categories like election, adoption, and the person/nature distinction.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic exposition via loci: God and his decrees; providence; covenant (works and grace); Christ the mediator; soteriology (election, adoption, imputation).
 - Defends **infralapsarian** ordering of decrees in continuity with Westminster (order of decree after the fall to maintain justice and the gospel).
 - Develops the **federal headship** motif: Adam as covenant head under the covenant of works; Christ as federal head under the covenant of grace - linking forensic imputation and federal representation.
 - Explicates **hypostatic union**: two natures, one person (the Son); communication of properties; sufficiency of Christ's obedience for imputation and adoption.
 - Uses scholastic distinctions (essence, attributes, person, nature, operation) to prevent modalist or Nestorian errors.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Westminster Confession, Scripture, Calvin, Beza.
 - Interlocutors: Amyraldians (hypothetical universalism), Arminians (free-will emphasis), Socinians (denial of orthodox Christology), Roman Catholic theologians.
 - Later interlocutors invoking similar vocabulary: Van Til (one-person language) - useful for comparison though anachronistic.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, divine decree, predestination (election and reprobation), covenant theology (works/grace), Christology (hypostatic union, mediator), adoption, imputation, soteriology, and aspects of Trinitarian personhood insofar as it bears on Christ's mediatorship.

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin reads the Westminster confession through a rigorous scholastic lens: defending a forensic, federal covenantal scheme and an orthodox hypostatic union that secures Christ's representative obedience and believers' adoption within the ordered plan of God's decrees.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision of terminology: strict distinction of person/nature and careful use of communicatio idiomatum to guard both natures in one person.
 - Integration of confessional statements with scholastic method - definitions, distinctions, objections, and replies - for pedagogical clarity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived laxity in some post-Reformation writers by insisting on confessional boundaries against Amyraldian universal intent, Arminian conditionality, and Socinian denial of satisfaction.
 - Contrasts a balanced infralapsarian ordering to both supralapsarian abstractions and Arminian contingency.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulates **federal headship** and **forensic imputation** with scholastic rigor so they function as explanatory principles across election, justification, and adoption.
 - Clarifies "one person" language in Chalcedonian terms to preempt both communicative collapse of natures and separation of persons.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Continental and later Anglo-American Reformed seminaries as a bridge between confessional documents and scholastic theology.
 - Provided the vocabulary and loci-structure that conservative Reformed theologians use to defend confessional covenant theology across centuries.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of reading a confession theologically: faithful to the WCF while applying precise philosophical-theological distinctions; invaluable for teaching covenant theology, doctrinal coherence, and orthodox Christology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Adam as federal head; life for obedience; basis for condemnation when violated.

- **Covenant of Grace**
 - God's single covenantal plan to save sinners through Christ; continuity with WCF formulations.

- **Federal Headship**
 - Representation theory linking Adam's failure to Christ's representative obedience and believers' imputation.

- **Predestination / Election and Reprobation**
 - Eternal decree of God; argued in an infralapsarian order compatible with WCF justice and gospel necessity.

- **Adoption**
 - Legal-forensic effect of union with Christ; entails filial privileges and inheritance, grounded in imputation and covenant union.

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Two complete natures united in one person (the Son); key to mediatorial work, communicatio idiomatum, and the validity of imputation of active/passive obedience.

- **Person vs Nature**
 - Critical distinction: one person (who acts) + two natures (properties), used to avoid Nestorian/Eutychian errors.

- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - The interchange of properties between natures within the one person; used to explain redemptive acts and soteriological attribution.

- **Order of Decrees (Infralapsarianism)**
 - God's decree to permit the fall precedes the decree of election/reprobation; preserves justice and the gospel.

- **Imputation (Active and Passive)**
 - Christ's obedience (active) and suffering/penal substitution (passive) imputed to believers; Adam's failure imputed to his posterity.

- **Biblical Covenants (Noahic/Abrahamic/Mosaic/New)**
 - Typological and progressive unfolding of covenant of grace; Turretin reads these through WCF categories.

- **One-Person Language (Van Til critique)**
 - Turretin's precision offers a corrective to recent polemical uses of "one-person" phrasing that may blur nature/person distinctions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional covenantal categories (works/grace, federal headship).
 - As **polemic** against Amyraldian, Arminian, and Socinian departures.
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenant texts and Christological passages.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian, Christological, and soteriological doctrines within Reformed orthodoxy.
