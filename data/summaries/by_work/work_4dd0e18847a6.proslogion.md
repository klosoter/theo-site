### TITLE
**Proslogion** by **Anselm of Canterbury** (c. 1077-1078)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Benedictine, monastic milieu at Bec; follows the earlier Monologion.
 - Augustinian inheritance, Scripture-suffused meditation; pre-scholastic but anticipates scholastic rigor.
 - Written as a prayed inquiry, not a classroom disputation, in a Latin West shaped by the ecumenical creeds.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a single, necessary demonstration that **God exists** and is **that-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-conceived**, and to unfold divine attributes in light of this.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Ch. 1: **Prayerful proem** seeking God, establishing **fides quaerens intellectum**.
 - Chs. 2-4: **Ontological reasoning**
 - From the notion of the greatest conceivable being to existence in re, not merely in intellectu.
 - Necessity: such a being **cannot be conceived not to exist**; all else exists through it.
 - Chs. 5-26: **Attributes by perfect-being analysis**
 - **Unity and simplicity**; **immutability**, **aseity**, **eternity**, **omniscience**, **omnipotence**, **impassibility**.
 - **Justice and mercy** reconciled without contradiction.
 - **Incomprehensibility** and the longing for **beatific vision**.
 - Not a treatise on Trinity or Christology; those are presupposed and developed elsewhere, yet implications abound for **Chalcedonian** and **atonement** reasoning.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - **Augustine**, **Boethius**, Scripture; later exchange with **Gaunilo** of Marmoutier.
 - Later readers: **Aquinas** (qualified critique), **Scotus**, Reformed scholastics, **Barth** (method), **Plantinga** (modal restatement).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology Proper**: existence and knowability of God; divine attributes; incomprehensibility.
 - **Christology**: implications for **impeccability**, **hypostatic union**, and **two-natures** coherence.
 - **Trinity**: implicitly aligned with credal monotheism; detailed trinitarian processions treated in other Anselmian works.
 - **Soteriology**: the justice-mercy dialectic seeds later **atonement** argumentation.

- **Closing line**
 - Theological center: **Faith seeks understanding of the One greater than can be conceived**, whose justice-and-mercy draw the mind toward vision and rest.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Prayer as method**: rational demonstration within doxology.
 - **Perfect-being theology**: attributes derived by greatness-maximizing analysis.
 - **Justice and mercy held together** without diminution of either.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters the **fool** who denies God by showing denial is incoherent given the concept.
 - Differs from empiricist or cosmological proofs; not from effects to cause but from concept to necessary reality.
 - Affirms the God of the **ecumenical creeds**, not a generic deist first principle.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The formula **that-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-conceived**.
 - Distinction of **in intellectu** vs **in re**; move to **necessary existence**.
 - Harmonization of **simplicity** with rich predication via analogical ascent.

- **Reception and influence**
 - **Gaunilo** objects with the lost island; Anselm replies.
 - **Aquinas** denies the argument as a proof for us, yet appropriates perfect-being insights.
 - Reformed orthodox use Anselmian attributes in **Chalcedonian** and **impeccability** debates; **Barth** commends the method of faith seeking understanding; **Plantinga** renews the argument modally.
 - Frames later discussion of **atonement** in Cur Deus Homo, rooting necessity in divine justice and honor.
 - Coheres with Western trinitarianism, informing discussions that touch the **filioque** within a simplicity framework.

- **Enduring value**
 - Canonical model of **fides quaerens intellectum**.
 - Baseline account of God for theology proper with cross-loci leverage in Trinity and Christology.
 - Pedagogically potent for uniting devotion, doctrine, and disciplined reason.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **That-than-which-nothing-greater-can-be-conceived**: Core definition guiding existence and attributes.
- **Fides quaerens intellectum**: Faith seeks understanding; method and posture of the work.
- **Ontological argument**: From concept to necessary existence; later recast modally.
- **In intellectu vs in re**: Conceptual existence vs real existence; the latter is greater.
- **Necessary existence**: God cannot be conceived not to exist; all else is contingent.
- **Divine simplicity**: God is not composed; grounds unity of attributes.
 - Underwrites coherence of **Chalcedonian** claims by distinguishing divine from human natures.
- **Impassibility and immutability**: No change or suffering in the divine nature.
 - Supports **impeccability** of the incarnate Son according to the divine nature.
- **Justice and mercy**: Perfectly and non-competitively united in God.
 - Seeds Anselmian **atonement** necessity as later explicated in Cur Deus Homo.
- **Incomprehensibility and beatific vision**: God exceeds thought; hope to see and rejoice.
- **Aseity**: From himself; undergirds Creator-creature distinction and worship.
- **Omnipotence and omniscience**: Defined without compromising simplicity.
- **Credal alignment**: Resonant with **ecumenical creeds**; compatible with Western accounts of Spirit procession in other works.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Theology Proper**: Concept of God and attribute grammar; grounding for the knowability of God.
 - **Christology**: Constraints for **hypostatic union**, **impeccability**, and **two-natures** without confusion or division.
 - **Soteriology**: Conceptual pivot for **atonement** necessity via justice and mercy.
 - **Trinity**: Background commitment to simplicity and unity that informs debates related to the **filioque** and processions.
