### TITLE
**Technology and the Virtues: A Philosophical Guide to a Future Worth Wanting** - Shannon Vallor (Oxford Univ. Press, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published amid rapid expansion of AI, social media, robotics, and ubiquitous computing (mid-2010s); intersects philosophy of technology, moral philosophy, and design ethics.
 - Part of a shift from principle-centered tech ethics to character- and practice-centered approaches in applied ethics and engineering education.

- **Central thesis**
 - Contemporary technologies reshape moral habits and capacities; only a renewed, virtue-ethical approach that cultivates specific "technomoral" virtues can reliably orient human flourishing in a technologically saturated future.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern technologies create new moral challenges (speed, scale, opacity, distributed agency) and produce moral deskilling.
 - Theoretical foundation: enriched Aristotelian/Confucian virtue ethics (phronesis, habituation, relational virtues) adapted to 21st-century sociotechnical contexts.
 - Prescription: identify and cultivate a core set of virtues relevant to technology (character traits and capacities), and embed them in education, professional formation, and design practice.
 - Practical moves: translate virtues into concrete guidance for designers, engineers, policymakers, and citizens; advocate for institutional, educational, and design-level interventions (e.g., value-sensitive design, moral habituation practices).

- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Classical sources: Aristotle (phronesis), Confucian virtue ethics.
 - Contemporary ethics: Alasdair MacIntyre, virtue-ethics revivalists.
 - Philosophy of technology and STS interlocutors (broadly: Heideggerian concerns about enframing and more pragmatic STS observations about distributed agency and affordances).
 - Engineering and design literature on value-sensitive design; engagement with empirical studies of technology use.

- **Doctrines / theological loci touched**
 - Not explicitly doctrinal; intersects with theological ethics, anthropology (what it means to be human), teleology and flourishing (eudaimonia), stewardship and vocation, and ecclesial formation for moral character.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Vallor urges a practical moral theology of technology: cultivate virtues that shape persons and institutions so technological power serves human and communal flourishing rather than undermining it.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves ethics from rules/outcomes to long-term character formation and habituation in sociotechnical contexts.
 - Treats technology itself as a formative force on moral psychology (not merely a neutral tool).

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Critiques consequentialist and deontological approaches for being inadequate to capture the distributed, habituating, and character-forming effects of technology.
 - Contrasts with techno-optimist views that assume moral outcomes follow from technical fixes; emphasizes moral cultivation alongside design.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes the label **"technomoral virtues"** - virtues specific to morally navigating technological life.
 - Emphasizes concepts like **moral deskilling / reskilling**, **moral habituation through design**, and **virtue-sensitive engineering**.

- **Reception & influence**
 - Widely cited in applied ethics, human-computer interaction, and engineering ethics; growing uptake in theological ethics as a resource for thinking about vocation, formation, and social holiness.
 - Influential for curricula linking virtue ethics with design practice; used in policy conversations about AI governance as a complement to rules and oversight.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a practicable bridge between classical virtue ethics and contemporary technological realities; valuable for ministers, ethicists, and educators concerned with formation, stewardship, and the common good.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technomoral virtues**
 - Character traits and cognitive-affective capacities required to live well with advanced technologies (e.g., honesty, humility, practical wisdom applied to tech contexts).

- **Moral deskilling**
 - The loss of moral competences due to technological delegation (e.g., reduced attention, diminished empathy).

- **Moral reskilling / upskilling**
 - Practices and pedagogies that restore or develop virtues needed in technological contexts.

- **Phronesis (practical wisdom)**
 - Central virtue for adjudicating competing goods and contexts; adapted to rapid, distributed techno-social decisions.

- **Moral habituation**
 - Formation of stable dispositions through repeated practices; Vallor emphasizes designing institutions and technologies that support good habits.

- **Value-sensitive design**
 - Design approach that embeds human values into technology; Vallor links it to virtue cultivation rather than only instrumentally encoding values.

- **Distributed / systemic moral agency**
 - Recognition that agency is spread across networks of people and technologies; virtues must account for collective and mediated action.

- **Ethical affordances**
 - Features of technologies that enable or inhibit certain moral behaviors; used to analyze how devices shape character.

- **Eudaimonia (flourishing)**
 - The telos toward which technomoral virtues aim - a form of human and communal flourishing in a technological age.

- **Moral attention / moral perception**
 - Capacity to perceive ethically salient features in fast-moving techno-social environments.

- **Moral imagination**
 - Ability to envision long-term and systemic consequences of technological decisions.

- **Vocation / professional formation**
 - Emphasis on forming tech professionals as moral agents, not merely skilled technicians.

- **Habitus (sociotechnical)**
 - Institutionalized patterns of practice that reinforce or undermine virtues.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the term "technomoral virtues" and for diagnosing moral deskilling in technology studies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in theological ethics to integrate virtue formation with tech stewardship and vocation.
- As a **pedagogical model** for curricula in seminary, engineering, and HCI courses on moral formation and design ethics.
- As a **polemic** against purely regulatory or consequentialist approaches-advocates complementary formation and design strategies.
