### TITLE
Jesus, the Son of God (article) - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed theological milieu; Murray writing from the Westminster/Princeton inheritance committed to orthodox, covenantal, and confessional Protestantism. Context includes engagement with historical-critical scholarship, Bultmannian existentialism, Schweitzerian eschatology, and emergent Barthian conversation about revelation and Word.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Jesus manifests an authentic, divine **messianic self-consciousness**; the title "Son of God" in the Gospels is not merely a post‑resurrection ecclesial ascription or pious hyperbole but expresses his eternal Sonship and royal, covenantal authority operative in the inauguration of the kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical survey of Gospel material that bears on Jesus' own awareness of messianic identity and mission (e.g., synoptic baptism/transfiguration/"I am" sayings, Johannine prologue and "I am" claims).
 - Theological synthesis connecting historical self‑consciousness to Trinitarian doctrine: the incarnate Son is the eternal Son; divine sonship underwrites messianic office.
 - Doctrinal implications for the nature of the kingdom: not only future apocalyptic expectation but an inaugurated covenantal reign centered in the person and work of Christ.
 - Polemic against reductive modern readings that sever the historical Jesus from the Christ-of-faith or reduce "Son of God" to mere exalted humanity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Critical interlocution with Schweitzer, Bultmann, liberal Protestant historiography; appropriation and critique of patristic and Reformed formulations (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum); conversation with confessional standards and biblical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and office), incarnation, Trinity (eternal Sonship), revelation (Christ as decisive self‑revelation), kingdom of God (inaugurated and eschatological), covenantal kingship, the relation of historical Jesus to ecclesial confession.
- **Closing line:** The article insists that the historical and theological data cohere in the conviction that Jesus truly understood and enacted his identity as the divine Son and covenant‑king, inaugurating the kingdom that is both present in his person and consummated in eschatological fulfillment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sharp insistence on the **objective divine self‑consciousness** of Jesus (not merely pious self‑awareness), grounded in Trinitarian ontology.
 - Framing the Messiahship primarily as **covenantal kingship** rather than only apocalyptic eschatology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Schweitzer's exclusive apocalyptic framing by arguing for durable covenantal authority and continuity with Israel's theocratic expectations.
 - Rejects Bultmannian reduction of messianic confession to existential projection; defends the historicity of Jesus' own messianic awareness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Deploys the phrase **"messianic consciousness"** with technical precision-distinguishing levels of self‑awareness, public proclamation, and relational Sonship rooted in Trinitarian being.
 - Emphasizes the nexus of **eternal Sonship + inaugurated kingdom** as a theological unit.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a robust corrective to liberal critical models and as a model for integrating exegetical care with dogmatic conviction.
 - Consulted in seminary Christology courses and cited in debates over the historical Jesus and the ontology of Sonship.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact exemplar of how to do integrated biblical theology and dogmatic Christology; durable resource for defending orthodox Sonship and the reality of Jesus' messianic self‑awareness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Son of God:** Title denoting eternal relationality within the Trinity and incarnate messianic office; not merely honorific.
- **Messianic consciousness:** The conscious, self‑recognition and public enactment by Jesus of his messianic identity and mission.
 - Distinguish: subjective awareness (Jesus' inner conviction) vs. objective office (covenantal authority).
- **Kingdom of God:** Covenantal reign inaugurated in Christ's person and work; both present and eschatological (inaugurated eschatology).
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The thesis that the kingdom is already present in Christ though not yet consummated.
- **Incarnation:** The hypostatic reality by which the eternal Son assumes human nature without loss of divine self‑consciousness.
- **Hypostatic union:** The personal union underpinning claims about Jesus' unified self‑consciousness as both God and man.
- **Divine self‑consciousness:** The claim that Jesus possessed genuine awareness of divine identity and mission.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Used to explain how divine attributes and actions may be ascribed to the incarnate person without confusion of natures.
- **Covenantal kingship:** Messianic office framed as fulfillment of Israel's covenant promises and as kingly rule over God's people.
- **Revelation (Christ as Word):** Christ as the decisive self‑revelation of God; biblical witness is authoritative for discerning messianic self‑consciousness.
- **Historical Jesus vs. Christ of faith:** Murray argues these are integrable; the historical subject genuinely bore the identity confessed by the church.
- **Authority:** Kingly, salvific authority rooted in Sonship and exercised in Christ's teaching, miracles, and redemptive work.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for classical, Reformed formulations of Sonship and messianic identity.
- As a **polemic** against liberal, existential, and demythologizing readings of Jesus.
- As an **exegetical model** for combining Gospel exegesis with dogmatic commitments about person and office.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on Christology and the theology of the kingdom.
