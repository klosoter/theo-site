### TITLE
Scripture and Truth - D. A. Carson & John D. Woodbridge (eds.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical response to modern and postmodern critiques of the Bible: aftermath of the Chicago Statement (1978), rising postliberal/postmodern hermeneutics, debates over inerrancy and historical criticism.
 - Ecumenical-evangelical attempt to bring biblical scholarship, philosophy of language, and systematic theology into a consolidated defense of Scripture's communicative role and authority.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is a truthful, normatively binding witness to God whose claims warrant confidence: truth must be defended both as propositional content and as redemptive-historical communication. The book addresses whether and how biblical truth can be affirmed in light of modern historical criticism and philosophical skepticism.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Articulation of what is meant by "truth" in relation to Scripture (engaging theories of truth and language).
 - Defense of inspiration and inerrancy/infallibility as coherent theological categories that respect historical particularity.
 - Methodological proposals for biblical interpretation that balance canonical and historical concerns.
 - Apologetic implications: how Scripture's truth functions for proclamation, doctrine, and witness in a pluralistic culture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages modern critical scholarship and liberal skepticism, neo-orthodoxy (e.g., Barthian emphases), and emerging postmodern relativism.
 - Dialogue with philosophy of language and epistemology (analytic categories used to sharpen theological claims).
 - Contributors draw on historical theology, biblical studies, and systematic theology to argue across disciplines.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, authority of Scripture, canon, hermeneutics, biblical theology; secondary treatment of Christology and soteriology as dependent on biblical truth-claims.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Scripture and Truth centers on the conviction that the Bible is divinely authoritative and truth-bearing-historically situated yet propositional and normatively decisive for faith and life-requiring disciplined hermeneutics and philosophical clarity to defend this claim in the modern/postmodern arena.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Marries careful philosophical analysis of "truth" with practical concerns of exegesis and doctrine; refuses the choice between naive literalism and radical relativism.
 - Stresses that biblical truth is simultaneously propositional (it makes real claims about God and history) and performative within the redemptive-historical context of the covenant community.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects liberal tendencies that privatize or demythologize Scripture by reasserting objective, communicable truth.
 - Counters neo-orthodox and some postmodern readings that reduce Scripture to existential encounter without propositional content.
 - Warns against brittle formulations of inerrancy that ignore genre, idiom, and historical context.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions among inerrancy, infallibility, and authority while proposing a pragmatic-theoretical framework for evaluating claims about Scripture.
 - Integrates analytic-philosophical tools (e.g., theories of truth, speech-act considerations) as aids to theological precision.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely respected in evangelical academic circles as a disciplined resource defending the doctrine of Scripture.
 - Used as a corrective model in seminary curricula and referenced in subsequent evangelical debates over inerrancy, canon formation, and hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable template for combining philosophical clarity, historical sensitivity, and theological fidelity in the doctrine of Scripture; valuable for scholars and pastors who must navigate contemporary critiques without capitulating to extremes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - God's supernatural empowerment of biblical authors resulting in Scripture's reliability for its intended purposes.
- **Inerrancy** - The claim that Scripture, properly interpreted, does not affirm falsehood in matters it intends to teach.
 - Often qualified with attention to genre and authorial intent.
- **Infallibility** - The trustworthiness of Scripture to accomplish its salvific and doctrinal purposes; sometimes preferred as pastoral language.
- **Authority (of Scripture)** - Normative status of the Bible for belief, ethics, and ecclesial practice.
- **Revelation** - Divine self-disclosure; Scripture is the written record of that disclosure in history.
- **Propositional content** - The view that Scripture communicates truth-claims that can be true or false; defended against purely existential readings.
- **Correspondence theory of truth** - Emphasized as a baseline: biblical claims correspond to reality; also tempered by speech-act/contextual concerns.
- **Hermeneutics** - Methodological principles promoted: attention to genre, historical context, canonical reading, and theological coherence.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - Emphasis on Scripture's narrative unity and Christ-centered trajectory as the context for interpreting propositions.
- **Verbal-plenary (and limits)** - Traditional descriptor affirmed in modified form: Scripture's words (not mechanical dictation) genuinely convey divine meaning.
- **Canon** - The church's recognition of Scripture as authoritative; discussion of formation and its theological significance.
- **Illumination** - The Spirit's enabling role in rightly apprehending Scripture's truth.
- **Philosophy of language** - Use of analytic tools to clarify what it means for Scripture to "say" something true.
- **Historical criticism (qualified)** - Accepted as a tool when bounded by theological commitments and canonical reading.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative evangelical formulations of inspiration, inerrancy, and authority.
- As a **polemic** against liberal demythologizing, neo-orthodox reductions, and postmodern relativism.
- As an **exegetical-method model** that integrates historical-critical findings with canonical and theological interpretation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in apologetics demonstrating how biblical truth-claims can be defended philosophically and historically.
