### TITLE
The Divine Revelation - Paul Helm

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed, analytic-theological milieu. Helm writes as a philosophically trained Reformed theologian engaging contemporary epistemology, historic Protestant confessions, and debates over Barthian and non‑propositional accounts of revelation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Revelation is primarily God's objective communication to creatures - a propositional and personal self‑presentation by which God makes himself known - and proper Christian knowledge of God depends on grasping that communication, while avoiding both crude verbalism and ungrounded subjectivism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarify what counts as revelation: its objects (God, Christ), forms (acts, words), and norms (Scripture as normative witness).
 - Defend a *propositional* core to revelation: truthful, contentful claims about God are essential for knowledge.
 - Situate propositional content within a *personal encounter*: revelation is speech/act by God, not merely detached propositions.
 - Address epistemic questions: how revelation warrants belief, role of testimony, internal testimony of the Spirit, and the relation to natural theology.
 - Apply to Scripture: authority, inspiration, and the normative role of canonical texts for doctrine and life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth and critics of propositionalism; analytic epistemologists (e.g., Plantinga/Alston themes); Reformed confessional sources and scholastic categories; contemporary evangelical defenders of biblical authority.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (special and general), Scripture and inspiration, epistemology of religious belief, Christ as revelation (Christology implicated), authority and interpretation, relation of revelation to natural theology.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** Revelation is God's authoritative, contentful self‑disclosure that grounds Christian knowledge - a propositional testimony given in personal, covenantal acts and embodied normatively in Scripture.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Balances **propositional content** with **personal encounter**: not mere abstract doctrine, but truth‑bearing speech by God.
 - Stresses **objective norms** (Scripture, divine testimony) over purely subjective religious experience while acknowledging the Spirit's internal confirmation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on radical Barthian/evental readings that downplay propositionality and the canonical role of Scripture.
 - Critiques existentialist and non‑cognitive views that reduce revelation to existential encounter without truth‑claims.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Tight analytic distinctions between types of revelation (act vs. content; testimony vs. evidence) useful for theological epistemology.
 - Emphasis on *warranted Christian belief* grounded in divine testimony rather than mere subjective assurance.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles for clarity on Scripture and revelation.
 - Influential in bringing analytic epistemological tools to bear on classical Protestant doctrine of revelation.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a disciplined, teachable model bridging philosophy of religion and systematic theology.
 - Serves as a corrective to both over‑intellectualized propositionalism and over‑subjective existentialism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Revelation:** God's self‑communication; conceived as both act and content.
- **Propositional revelation:** The idea that revelation includes truth‑bearing propositions about God that can be believed or assented to.
 - Contrasts with purely non‑propositional or existentialist accounts.
- **Divine self‑presentation:** God's personal initiative in making himself known; ties propositional content to the act of disclosure.
- **Testimony (divine testimony):** The communicative vehicle of revelation; Scripture and Christ as primary testimonies.
- **Scripture as normative witness:** Canonical texts function as authoritative record and norm for doctrine and faith.
- **Internal testimony / illumination:** The Spirit's confirming role in making revealed truth effective for believers without replacing objective warrant.
- **Objective vs. subjective aspects:** Distinction between revelation's propositional/objective content and the subjective appropriation of that content.
- **Warranted Christian belief:** Epistemic status conferred when divine testimony is rightly grasped and internally confirmed.
- **Special vs. general revelation:** Special (Scripture, Christ) as normative; general (creation, conscience) as subordinate evidential support.
- **Act vs. content distinction:** Revelation as God's act of speaking and as the content reported in testimony.
- **Authority / inspiration:** Scripture's trustworthiness and normative authority grounded in divine authorship and testimony.
- **Hermeneutical responsibility:** The need for sound interpretive practices to connect canonical testimony with doctrinal assent.
- **Christ as Word:** Christology framed as the decisive center of revelation - the ultimate self‑disclosure of God.
- **Epistemological alignment:** Use of analytic tools to show how revelation can provide rational warrant for belief.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for propositional yet personal conceptions of revelation in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** resource against non‑propositional and overly event‑centered models (e.g., certain Barthian readings).
 - As an **epistemological model** in apologetics and philosophy of religion: showing how divine testimony can ground warranted Christian belief.
