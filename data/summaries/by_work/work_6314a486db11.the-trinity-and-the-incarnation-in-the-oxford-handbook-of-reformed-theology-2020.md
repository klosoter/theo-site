### TITLE
The Trinity and the Incarnation - Robert Letham (The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology, 2020)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contribution to a 2020 Oxford Handbook surveying Reformed theological loci; written within contemporary Reformed renewal that seeks classic orthodoxy in conversation with modern Trinitarian debates.
 - Aimed at advanced students and scholars concerned to preserve Nicene‑Chalcedonian categories against revisionary modern proposals.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The orthodox doctrine of the Trinity (properly understood as both ontological and economic) is the necessary hermeneutical and metaphysical ground for a right doctrine of the Incarnation: the Son assumes human nature in the hypostatic union without change to the divine essence, and the economic revelation of God in Christ discloses but does not alter the ontological Trinity.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies the distinction and relation between the **ontological (immanent)** Trinity and the **economic** Trinity:
 - Distinction upheld to guard against conflation of God's inner life with God's acts.
 - Relation insisted (no separation): economic revelation genuinely discloses eternal relations.
 - Reaffirms classical Trinitarian categories (persons, relations of origin - eternal generation, procession) as necessary for intelligible Christology.
 - Explicates the Incarnation in line with Chalcedon:
 - Two natures (divine, human) united in one person (the Son) without mixture, change, division, or confusion.
 - Uses **communicatio idiomatum** and **perichoresis** to show how properties are ascribed in Scripture.
 - Critiques contemporary alternatives:
 - Warns that "social" Trinitarian models can invite tritheism or make the inner life of God dependent on history.
 - Rejects strong kenotic/cessationist readings that imply alteration of divine nature in the Incarnation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Historical: Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine, Chalcedonian formulators, Reformed figures (e.g., Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy).
 - Modern interlocutors: social‑Trinitarian proponents, kenotic theologians, and voices like Barth/Moltmann where relevant to method and emphasis.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (ontological vs economic), Christology (Incarnation, hypostatic union), revelation, divine simplicity and immutability (implied), communicatio idiomatum, perichoresis, soteriology by implication (mediatorial work).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Incarnation must be read as God's economic self‑revelation that authentically discloses the ontological Trinity while preserving the immutable, eternal distinctions of the divine life and the unaltered divinity of the Son in the hypostatic union.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on both the distinction and non‑separability of ontological and economic aspects: one must not equalize them nor detach them.
 - Careful deployment of classical categories (eternal generation, procession) as indispensable for sound Christology and orthodox worship.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects modern "social" Trinitarianisms that read the Trinity primarily as a network of relations constituted in history.
 - Challenges kenotic readings that imply a change in divine being at the Incarnation; instead affirms incarnation as assumption, not alteration.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Less innovation than a recuperation: reframes contemporary debates by restoring classical precision about person/essence, communicatio idiomatum, and perichoretic language for pastoral and doctrinal clarity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a timely conservative corrective within Reformed circles; used in teaching as a terse, historically informed statement linking Reformed doctrine to classical Trinitarian and Chalcedonian orthodoxy.
 - Cited by those defending traditional formulations against revisionary proposals in academic and confessional contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, historically grounded synthesis useful for seminars, confessional formation, and as a reference point in debates over how Trinitarian doctrine grounds Christology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ontological Trinity**
 - The immanent, eternal life of God (persons and relations independent of God's external acts).

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God's self‑revelation and actions in history (creation, covenant, redemption - esp. in Christ). 
 - Letham: distinct but properly reflective of the ontological.

- **Hypostatic Union**
 - The union of two natures (divine and human) in one Person, the Son; central to Letham's Christology.

- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - The communication of properties between divine and human natures; used to explain scriptural ascriptions to Christ.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of the Trinity; used to articulate relational unity without loss of personal distinction.

- **Eternal Generation / Procession**
 - Relations of origin within the Godhead (Son eternally begotten, Spirit proceeding) affirmed as theological necessities for orthodox Trinitarianism.

- **Divine Simplicity & Immutability**
 - Underlying commitments: God's essence is not changed in the Incarnation; Letham appeals to these classical attributes to rebut alterationist readings.

- **Kenosis (limited)**
 - Discussed critically: kenotic models that posit loss or change in divine attributes are rejected; incarnation construed as voluntary self‑emptying in role, not essence.

- **Social Trinitarianism (criticized)**
 - Contemporary model emphasizing interpersonal relations; Letham warns it can fragment divine unity or subordinate the ontological Trinity to the economic.

- **Person (hypostasis) vs Nature (ousia)**
 - Maintains classical distinction: one divine nature in three persons; crucial for correct ascription of actions and properties.

- **Mediator / Two‑fold office (implied use)**
 - Christ as true Mediator by virtue of his two natures; Trinitarian grounding for soteriology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for ontological vs economic Trinity and their proper relation.
- As a **polemic** and corrective against social‑Trinitarian and strong kenotic proposals.
- As an **exegetical and doctrinal model** for linking Trinitarian doctrine to Chalcedonian Christology and Reformed soteriology.
