### TITLE
The Bible and the Future - Chapters by Robert B. Strimple: "Revelation 20 and the Millennium"

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship; produced within conservative Reformed/evangelical milieu that was engaging renewed interest in eschatological options (premillennial, postmillennial, amillennial).
 - Strimple writes as a confessional Reformed theologian concerned to read Revelation within canonical, covenantal, and christological horizons rather than as isolated prophecy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The interpretive key to Revelation 20 is recognizing the symbolic, apocalyptic genre and the canonical context; the "thousand years" is not a literal future political reign but a symbolic period describing Christ's present reign and the church age (an amillennial/inaugurated eschatology posture).
 - The chapter aims to settle disputes about the nature and timing of the millennium, the meaning of the "first resurrection," and the binding of Satan.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Genre and hermeneutic first: stress on apocalyptic symbolism and consistent canonical reading (compare Old Testament use of numbers and victory motifs).
 - Exegesis of key elements:
 - **The thousand years**: interpreted as symbolic of a complete, limited era (not literal chronology); parallels with Old Testament symbolic numbers; aligns with "already/not yet" kingdom.
 - **The binding of Satan**: seen as a decisive defeat enacted in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension; binding is real but partial - it restrains Satan's ability to prevent gospel advance rather than eliminating all demonic activity.
 - **The first resurrection**: identified primarily with spiritual regeneration/union with Christ (the believer's participation in Christ's resurrection) and/or the martyrs' vindication rather than a delayed physical resurrection preceding a millennial earthly reign.
 - **Final judgment and new creation**: Revelation 20 leads forward to the ultimate eschatological consummation; the millennial motif is subordinate to the final, irreversible victory and new heavens/earth.
 - Polemical moves: critiques literalistic premillennial readings that isolate Revelation 20 from its apocalyptic context and from the broader New Testament witness about Christ's present reign.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classic interpreters across the spectrum: patristic and medieval uses of Apocalyptic imagery; Reformation and post-Reformation (Reformed) readings; contemporary premillennialists and historic premillennial positions.
 - Scripture-focused dialogue: cross-references to Paul's resurrection theology, Johannine and Pauline texts on kingdom already/not yet, and Old Testament prophetic-symbolic uses.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, Christology (victory in death and resurrection), redemption (already/not yet), spiritual resurrection, Satanology, hermeneutics of apocalyptic literature, ecclesiology (the church as present manifestation of Christ's reign).

- **Closing line**
 - Strimple's theological center: Revelation 20, rightly read within canonical and christological context, testifies to Christ's present reign and decisive victory now consummated finally at the eschaton - the millennium is symbolic of the inaugurated kingdom, not a future temporal political epoch.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong canonical-covenantal hermeneutic: interprets Revelation as consistent with Pauline and Johannine themes rather than as a stand-alone predictive chart.
 - Careful attention to genre: treats numeric and symbolic language as theological symbolism with typological resonance rather than as straightforward chronology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects literalist premillennialism for isolating Revelation 20 and for neglecting the New Testament's testimony to the present reality of Christ's reign.
 - Contrasts with dispensational premillennial frameworks by denying a future millennial political reign distinct from the final resurrection/consummation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the "binding" of Satan as functional/relational restraint (curtailing ability to prevent gospel advance) more than absolute impotence - a nuanced middle language between total defeat and unrestrained activity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Reformed and amillennial readers as a clear, exegetically grounded defense of inaugurated eschatology.
 - Used in seminary classrooms as a concise rebuttal of literalistic millennial schemes and as a model for canonical/apocalyptic reading.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined, text-centered model for interpreting apocalyptic passages within Reformed theology; useful for pastors and scholars confronting sensationalist eschatologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Millennium / "thousand years"**
 - Symbolic period representing the present age of Christ's reign; not necessarily literal chronological span.

- **Binding of Satan**
 - Christ's victory that restrains Satan's power to thwart gospel advance; effectual but not total cessation of demonic activity.

- **First resurrection**
 - Primarily spiritual regeneration and vindication of martyrs; participation in Christ's risen life rather than solely a postponed bodily event.

- **Already / Not Yet**
 - Central hermeneutical frame: kingdom inaugurated in Christ, awaiting final consummation.

- **Apocalyptic symbolism**
 - Use of numbers, images, and typology that require canonical and theological cross-reference, not literalistic mapping.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Doctrine that ultimate eschatological realities have begun in Christ and unfold until final consummation.

- **Canonical reading**
 - Interpreting Revelation in light of the whole New Testament witness (Paul, John, Gospel kingdom motifs).

- **Soteriological resurrection**
 - Emphasis on resurrection language as theological participation in Christ (life from death) within covenantal redemption.

- **Eschatological consummation**
 - Final judgment and new creation as the decisive terminus to which the symbolic millennium points.

- **Hermeneutic contrast**
 - Literal/chronological (premillennial) vs. symbolic/canonical (Strimple's approach).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20 within canonical-theological parameters.
- As a **polemic** and corrective against literalist and dispensational premillennial interpretations.
- As a **definition source** for Reformed/amillennial articulations of inaugurated eschatology and the theological meaning of the millennium.
