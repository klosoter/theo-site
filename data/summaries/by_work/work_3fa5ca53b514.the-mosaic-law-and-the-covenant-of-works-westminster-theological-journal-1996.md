### TITLE
The Mosaic Law and the Covenant of Works - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal, 1996)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-1990s Reformed scholarship addressing renewed debate over the status of the Mosaic covenant within federal theology. Conversation engages Westminster tradition, 20th-century Reformed commentators (e.g., Murray, Vos), and contemporary debates about "republication" of the covenant of works.
- **Central thesis**
 - Poythress contends that the Mosaic law manifests a **covenant-of-works character "as to substance"**: it presses the works-demand (perfect obedience and threatened penalty) while functioning within God's broader redemptive economy rather than as a simple, isolated re-erection of the Adamic covenant of works.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define key categories: covenant of works, covenant of grace, and the republication thesis.
 - Historical-theological survey of Reformed positions on Mosaic law and republication.
 - Exegetical scrutiny of Old Testament texts (e.g., Sinai covenants, Decalogue, sacrificial/ceremonial provisions) and New Testament reflection (notably Pauline usage of "works" and "promise").
 - Analytical distinction between **substance** (the moral demands and sanction structure) and **administration/form** (mediatorial accommodations, sacrificial system, promises pointing forward to Christ).
 - Proposal: Mosaic enactments reassert the works-demand substantively while embedding it within a covenantal administration that includes grace-mediated elements (typology, promise, priestly/ceremonial accommodations).
 - Theological implications for law/gospel relations, continuity between Adamic/Mosaic/Christian covenants, and pastoral application.
- **Figures and interlocutors**
 - Engages classical Reformed sources (Westminster divines), 20th-century Reformed theologians (John Murray, Geerhardus Vos), and proponents of the republication thesis; dialogues with exegetical readings of Paul and OT covenant texts.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (form and substance), law and gospel, soteriology (works vs promise), typology and mediation, revelation and divine command.
- **Closing line**
 - The Mosaic law is neither a mere repetition of Adamic works-covenant nor a pure covenant of grace alone; it reasserts the works-demand **as to substance** while operating within God's mediatorial, redemptive administration that ultimately points to Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp distinction between **substance** (what the law commands and sanctions) and **administration/form** (how God structures covenant life and mediates grace).
 - Careful attempt to preserve both the seriousness of the law's demands and the continuity of redemptive history toward Christ.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against simplistic "republication" claims that treat the Mosaic covenant as a straightforward reestablishment of the Adamic covenant in form.
 - Counters strict antinomian readings that deny any works-character to Mosaic legislation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - The phrase and analytical move "as to substance" functions as a pivot: allows recognition of works-demand without collapsing the Mosaic covenant into an independent covenant of works.
 - Emphasis on administrative/mediatorial accommodations to explain ceremonial/penal elements that otherwise look like a pure works-covenant.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarifying debates on republication and law/gospel relations; frequently cited in discussions of covenant typology and Pauline exegesis.
 - Serves as a corrective to polarized positions; influential among those seeking a balanced federal theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, usable framework for pastors and scholars to teach the seriousness of the law while maintaining Christ-centered covenant continuity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - covenant characterized by a condition of perfect obedience and penal sanction (death) for breach; originally associated with Adam.
- **Covenant of Grace** - covenant founded on promise and mediated by Christ, where salvation is by grace through faith, not works.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - the covenantal complex given at Sinai, including moral, civil, and ceremonial laws; the main subject of Poythress's analysis.
- **Republication (of the Covenant of Works)** - thesis that Mosaic law re-presents or republishes the Adamic covenant of works to a new party.
 - Poythress critiques simple republication while affirming a qualified works-character.
- **"As to Substance"** - Poythress's key phrase: the Mosaic law embodies the substantive works-demand (obedience and sanction) even if not a full formal republication.
- **Administration / Form** - the outward structure and mediations (sacrifices, priests, civil ordinances) that shape how the covenant operates historically.
- **Works-Principle** - the principle that obedience earns covenant blessing and failure incurs penalty; identified substantively in Mosaic demands.
- **Promise-Principle** - the opposite pole: covenant grounded in divine promise; central to covenant of grace and to Pauline argumentation.
- **Mediator / Mediatorial Accommodation** - Christological anticipation in Mosaic structures; explains how works-demands coexist with redemptive promise.
- **Typology** - the interpretive key by which Mosaic institutions point forward to Christ and ultimate fulfillment.
- **Law / Gospel Relation** - the theological problem addressed: how law's demands and gospel's promises cohere.
- **Penal Sanction** - the threatened curse or death attached to breach; part of the works-character identified in Mosaic law.
- **Moral vs Ceremonial Distinction** - used to parse law components; Poythress stresses substance of moral demand while also accounting for ceremonial accommodation.
- **Perfect Obedience** - the requirement implicit in works-structure; its presence in Mosaic norms is central to the argument.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** clarifying "republication" vs "as to substance" distinctions in covenant theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both strong republicationists and antinomians.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Sinai texts and Pauline law/promise dialectic within a unified redemptive-historical framework.
