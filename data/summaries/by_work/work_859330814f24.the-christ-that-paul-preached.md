### TITLE
The Christ that Paul Preached - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton/Presbyterian milieu; reaction against liberal-critical reductions of New Testament Christology. Warfield writes as a conservative exegete and dogmatician aiming to show theological continuity between Paul and historic orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's Christology presents Christ as pre-existent, divine, incarnate, truly human and truly divine in personal unity; this Pauline picture both demands and coheres with the historic formulations (e.g., Hypostatic Union/Chalcedon) and grounds Christian eschatological anthropology.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of key Pauline loci (Philippians 2; Colossians 1; Romans 5-8; 1 Corinthians 15) to demonstrate:
 - Pre-existence and divine attributes of Christ (active in creation, bearer of divine titles).
 - Real incarnation: God became flesh without loss of deity.
 - Atonement as vicarious, representative, substitutionary act grounded in the person of the incarnate Son.
 - Exaltation/resurrection/ascension as vindication and as guarantee for believers' eschatological hope.
 - Polemic moves showing that views which reduce Christ to moral exemplar, mere man, or adopt kenotic schemas conflict with Pauline data.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary critics (liberal figures and higher criticism broadly), earlier systematicians and patristic testimony implicitly as corroboration; leans on Reformed confessions for doctrinal framing.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (central), Trinity (implications), soteriology (atonement, justification), eschatology (resurrection, future body), anthropology (union with Christ, persons in last things), revelation (Christ as center of revelation).
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield insists that the Christ whom Paul preaches is the incarnate, pre-existent Son whose personal unity as God-man is the necessary basis for atonement and for the believer's present union and future eschatological transformation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous exegetical linkage between Pauline texts and classical Christological confession: the NT data are read as naturally yielding the doctrines later defined by the church.
 - Stress on the objective, corporate, and representative aspects of Christ's work: personhood of the Redeemer is decisive for efficacy.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal reductions (ethical exemplar, purely spiritual presence) and speculative kenotic theories that posit loss or alteration of deity in the incarnation.
 - Contrasts with contemporaneous tendencies to separate Paul from later dogma-Warfield argues continuity rather than development-as-deviation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not an innovation in doctrine but an influential methodological posture: dogmatics must be built from careful biblical exegesis rather than abstract metaphysics or modern skepticism.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical scholarship as a model for faithful Pauline Christology and for resisting modernist reinterpretations.
 - Used in seminary curricula for connecting biblical exegesis with systematic outcomes.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable exemplar of how to move from Pauline texts to dogmatic claims about the Hypostatic Union, Chalcedonian two-natures doctrine, and the soteriological/eschatological implications for human destiny.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union**
 - Warfield reads Paul as presupposing a single personal subject who is both divine and human; the union is presented as necessary for substitutionary atonement and resurrection.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine**
 - Treats Chalcedon as the theological articulation that best captures Pauline data: one person, two natures without confusion or separation.
- **Pre-existence**
 - Christ's existence and activity before incarnation (e.g., "in Christ" language, creative agency) is central to Warfield's demonstration of divine identity.
- **Incarnation**
 - Emphasized as real assumption of human nature by the divine Son, not an absorption or depletion of deity.
- **Atonement / Substitution**
 - Vicarious, penal and representative; dependent on the personhood of the incarnate Son-only God-man could reconcile sinners.
- **Representation / Federal Headship**
 - Christ functions as the second Adam and representative head; Paul's soteriology is corporate and forensic.
- **Exaltation / Resurrection / Ascension**
 - Not merely reward but the vindication and confirmation of the person and work of Christ; guarantees believers' resurrection.
- **"In Christ" (Pauline union)**
 - Central relational category linking believer to the historical and eschatological benefits of Christ's person and work.
- **Eschatological Anthropology**
 - Human destiny (resurrection body, final conformity to Christ) is grounded in the person and work of the risen, exalted Son as presented by Paul.
- **Kenoticism (rejected)**
 - Warfield argues that kenotic readings undermine the continuity of divine being and cannot account for Pauline claims about divine agency.
- **Revelation / Christ as Logos**
 - Christ is the fullest self-disclosure of God; Paul's language supports a revelatory Christ who is personal and active.
- **Union-of-persons logic**
 - The personal unity of Christ is the conceptual pivot linking Christology to soteriology and anthropology.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: as an exegetically grounded defense of the Hypostatic Union and Chalcedonian shape for Paulinism.
 - Polemic: a resource against liberal, adoptive, or kenotic Christologies.
 - Exegetical model: exemplar for reading Pauline texts coherently into dogmatic conclusions about person, work, and eschatological human destiny.
