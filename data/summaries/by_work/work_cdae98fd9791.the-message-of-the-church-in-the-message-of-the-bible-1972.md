### TITLE
The Message of the Church - Edmund P. Clowney (in The Message of the Bible, 1972)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1970s evangelical-Reformed renewal; reaction to pietistic subjectivism, revivalist excesses, and mainline liberal decline.
 - Clowney writes as a confessional Presbyterian pastor-theologian aiming to recover a public, covenantal ecclesiology for contemporary preaching and worship.

- **Central thesis**
 - The church's identity and mission are defined by its stewardship of the gospel through the public proclamation of the Word and the regular administration of the sacraments and prayer as Christ-given **means of grace**.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - The church exists to **hear, embody, and declare** the message of Christ; this message is communicated primarily by:
 - **Preaching** - the authoritative public exposition and application of Scripture.
 - **Sacraments** - Baptism and the Lord's Supper as signs and seals whereby the covenant promises are applied.
 - **Prayer** - corporate petition and praise that integrates the congregation into Christ's priestly life.
 - These means are covenantal: the church is a covenant people called to ongoing sanctification and mission.
 - Pastoral and liturgical consequences follow: order in worship, eldership oversight, and a ministry shaped by Word-and-sacrament priorities.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on **Reformed confessional** tradition (e.g., Westminster), Calvinist sacramental theology, and earlier Reformed pastors/theologians who emphasize preaching as central.
 - Polemically addresses pietism, revivalism that minimizes means, and sacramental skepticism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture and preaching), Christology (presence and application of Christ in Word and sacrament), Covenant theology, Ecclesiology (visible church), Sacramentology, Soteriology (application of redemption), Prayer and worship.

- **Closing line**
 - The church is the covenantal steward of the gospel, entrusted to make Christ present to his people through Word, sacrament, and prayer - the means by which the Redeemer applies his saving work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that **preaching** is not merely motivational but sacramental in function: the public word effects covenantal union with Christ when faithfully proclaimed.
 - Balanced recovery of the **sacraments as means of grace** - neither purely memorial nor intrinsically magical, but effective as covenant signs and seals.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic tendencies that privatize faith and undervalue public means; challenges revivalist models that emphasize experience over instituted means.
 - Pushes back against liberal ecclesiology that reduces the church to a social institution by re-centering its theological function.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Tight coupling of "message" as both **content** (gospel) and **medium** (Word/sacrament) - the church's message is inseparable from the way it is delivered.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used among Reformed evangelicals as a clarifying, pastoral ecclesiology; influential in worship and preaching renewal movements.
 - Praised for bridging confessional theology and pastoral practice; cited in seminary courses and pastoral training.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, pastorally sensitive model for thinking about worship, preaching, sacraments, and pastoral order grounded in covenant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Means of grace** - Instruments God uses to impart Christ's benefits (primarily Word, sacrament, prayer).
- **Preaching** - Public, authoritative exposition of Scripture; central means by which the congregation hears and receives the gospel.
- **Sacraments** - Baptism and Lord's Supper as **signs and seals** that confirm covenant promises and apply union with Christ.
 - Not mere symbolism; efficacy rooted in God's promise and Christ's presence.
- **Word (proclaimed and written)** - Scripture as normative content; preaching as the evented form of Scripture's saving action.
- **Covenant community** - The church defined as people bound by divine promises and obligations; ecclesial identity is covenantal rather than merely congregational.
- **Worship (order and liturgy)** - Corporate pattern that shapes reception of the message; structure matters for the faithful administration of means.
- **Prayer** - Corporate participation in Christ's priestly intercession; formative and communicative within worship.
- **Visible church** - The local, public assembly where Word and sacraments are administered; distinguished from the invisible church.
- **Presence of Christ** - Real, covenantal presence mediated in preaching and sacraments without requiring metaphysical speculation.
- **Efficacy** - Theologically restrained: means work by God's promise and Spirit, not by human merit or ritual alone.
- **Pastoral oversight / eldership** - Governance aimed at faithful stewardship of the message and the means.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source** for teaching the Reformed doctrine of the **means of grace** and the centrality of preaching.
 - **Polemic** against pietistic privatization and revivalist excess - used to defend ordered public worship.
 - **Exegetical/pastoral model** for homiletics and liturgical planning - a concise framework connecting pulpit, sacraments, and prayer as a unified pastoral strategy.
