### TITLE
The Mosaic of Atonement - Joshua M. McNall

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary theological and biblical conversation linking Old Testament cultus to New Testament atonement theology.
 - Written within a broadly Reformed/covenantal milieu that seeks to integrate biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and liturgical implications.
- **Central thesis**
 - The Mosaic sacrificial system should be read as a *composite, covenantal mosaic* that both anticipates and shapes the New Testament doctrine of atonement: a multi-dimensional picture that resists reduction to a single paradigm (e.g., purely forensic penal substitution).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Close-reading of Mosaic legislation and cultic texts (esp. Leviticus) to identify recurring categories (expiation, purification, restitution, consecration).
 - Part 2: Theological synthesis showing how ritual forms, legal language, and covenantal identity cohere into a composite atonement schema.
 - Part 3: Systematic implications for Christology and soteriology - how Christ fulfills, transforms, and perfects the Mosaic elements.
 - Part 4: Pastoral and liturgical applications; how the church may retrieve sacrificial motifs responsibly for worship and preaching.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical and contemporary Reformed and evangelical treatments of atonement.
 - Dialogues with biblical scholars on cultic studies and anthropology of ritual.
 - Situated in conversation with both proponents and critics of monolithic atonement theories (e.g., single-cause penal models and exclusively Christus Victor readings).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (Mosaic covenant as formative for soteriology).
 - Christology (fulfillment of priestly and sacrificial functions).
 - Atonement (multifaceted: expiation, substitution, reconciliation, victory).
 - Ecclesiology and liturgy (how the church memorializes and benefits from atoning work).
- **Closing line**
 - The Mosaic of Atonement reframes Israel's cultus not as a mere foreshadowing of one doctrinal nugget but as a theologically rich mosaic whose interlocking pieces are indispensable for a robust, biblically rooted doctrine of Christ's saving work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Mosaic sacrifice as a *spectrum* rather than a single mechanism: legal, ritual, symbolic, and communal elements are held in tandem.
 - Emphasizes covenantal identity and social restoration (community holiness) as central goals of Mosaic atoning practice.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against accounts that reduce the OT to mere "types" of penal substitution; argues such reductions distort ritual logic and covenantal grammar.
 - Challenges minimalist readings that treat Levitical practices as purely cultic with no theological weight for NT doctrine.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **"Mosaic mosaic"** - the image/metaphor of a composite picture made of distinct atonement tiles (ritual, legal, representative, and relational).
 - **"Covenantal-ritual nexus"** - term for the mutual shaping of legal stipulation and cultic enactment in Israel's life.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but growing influence among scholars and pastors who seek a balanced, biblically nuanced atonement theology.
 - Valued as a corrective within Reformed circles that want to retain forensic categories while recovering sacrificial and communal dimensions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable framework for bridging OT exegesis and NT soteriology.
 - Serves as a resource for preaching and liturgical formation that honors both sacrificial symbolism and gospel proclamation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement (composite)** - the claim that atonement comprises multiple interrelated actions (expiation, substitution, reconciliation, victory).
- **Mosaic covenant** - the covenantal context in which Israel's sacrifices acquire theological meaning and social function.
- **Typology (fulfillment, not mere correspondence)** - OT rites prefigure Christ but do so by shared functions and narrative culmination, not simple one-to-one allegory.
- **Expiation / purification** - ritual removal of impurity; treated as a real, communally enacted cleansing with theological consequences.
- **Substitution** - representative bearing of consequences; allowed but situated among other motifs rather than elevated to sole mechanism.
- **Propitiation / divine wrath language** - acknowledged as part of the mosaic, interpreted in covenantal terms rather than solely juridical metaphysics.
- **Imputation (covenantal representation)** - believer's standing changes by representation within covenant structures; links to NT forensic language.
- **Priesthood / sanctuary** - roles and places that mediate atoning action; Christ as priest who perfects these mediatory functions.
- **Ritual efficacy** - the functional power of ritual acts within the covenant community to restore holiness and identity.
- **Covenantal-ritual nexus** - shorthand for how law and cult shape soteriological meaning together.
- **Sacrificial spectrum** - the range of purposes sacrifices serve (propitiatory, expiatory, thanksgiving, restitution).
- **Legal-forensic language** - legal metaphors in Mosaic texts that interact with ritual enactment.
- **Communal restoration** - emphasis on atonement as social re-creation and covenantal belonging.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a multi-faceted doctrine of atonement that resists reductionism.
- As a **polemic** against monolithic penal-only or ritual-only accounts.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Leviticus and other cultic texts in theological ecology with the NT.
