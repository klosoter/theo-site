### TITLE
Eschatology Notes and Lectures (various, Westminster Theological Seminary and Reformed Theological Seminary) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Lectures and class notes delivered at Westminster and Reformed Theological Seminary (late 20th - early 21st century).
 - Situated in late Reformed covenantal revival, responding to popular dispensationalism and renewed scholarly work on inaugurated eschatology.
 - Authorial context: Frame as Reformed systematician, presuppositional apologist, and pedagogue - practical classroom synthesis rather than a single monograph.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology must be read through a **covenantal, Christocentric, inaugurated/consummatory** lens; the "millennium" is not a foreign chronological compartment but integrally bound to Christ's mediatorial reign now and at the consummation.
 - Primary polemic: against dispensational separatism and literalistic millennial chronologizing that severs Israel and the church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of key apocalyptic texts (Revelation 20; Daniel; selected Pauline and Johannine eschatological passages).
 - Theological framing: covenant theology, Christ's mediatorial reign, already/not-yet tension.
 - Argues for a symbolic/typological reading of Revelation's millennium passages, consistent with canonical theology.
 - Treats resurrection, judgment, and new creation as final, objective events that fulfill covenantal promises.
 - Comparative critique: evaluates premillennial (historic and dispensational) and postmillennial positions against amillennial/inaugurated model.
 - Practical implications: ecclesiology, mission, and Christian hope framed by present reign and future consummation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed writers (Vos, Warfield, Berkhof), mid-20th-century critics of dispensationalism (Anthony Hoekema, George Eldon Ladd), and contemporary scholars of Revelation.
 - Responds to dispensationalists such as John Walvoord/Charles Ryrie and to popular premillennial streams.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), covenant theology, Christology (mediatorial reign), kingdom of God, ecclesiology, resurrection, final judgment, new creation, hermeneutics (typology vs. literalism).

- **Closing line**
 - Frame's eschatology centers on a **covenantal, Christ-centered inaugurated-consummatory** framework: Christ now reigns, the promises are being fulfilled typologically, and the final consummation will be a single, decisive divine act that completes covenantal restoration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that eschatology must be read within a coherent covenantal system; eschatological statements are promises within God's covenant administration, not detachable chronological puzzles.
 - Fusion of presuppositional apologetic style with eschatological hermeneutics: theological commitments govern legitimate readings of apocalyptic literature.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects dispensational literalism by reasserting biblical typology and continuity between Israel and the church.
 - Distinguishes from naïve allegorizing: argues for symbolic readings grounded in canonical, historical-grammatical exegesis rather than subjective spiritualizing.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes "inaugurated-consummatory" as a governing schema rather than a mere slogan - applied systematically to millennium, kingdom, and resurrection.
 - Applies presuppositional categories to eschatological method: theological presuppositions shape interpretive legitimacy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed classrooms for clarity and pedagogical utility; often used to counter popular premillennial narratives.
 - Influences pastors and seminarians seeking a coherent, covenantal eschatology; less prescriptive for scholars committed to alternative hermeneutical starting points.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable as a compact, theologically integrated syllabus linking systematic theology and exegesis.
 - Useful for teaching the relation of kingdom theology, covenant, and hope; prompts careful critical engagement with literalist eschatologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism**
 - Interprets the millennium as the present, spiritual reign of Christ between ascension and return; Revelation's 1000 years is symbolic.
- **Premillennialism (historic & dispensational)**
 - Historic: Christ returns before a literal earthly millennium; Disp.: strict chronological dispensations, future earthly role for ethnic Israel.
- **Postmillennialism**
 - Optimistic view of gospel-driven cultural transformation culminating before Christ's return; Frame treats it cautiously and evaluates covenantal plausibility.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology**
 - The kingdom is "already" inaugurated in Christ's work and "not yet" consummated at his return.
- **Already/Not Yet**
 - Tension between present realities (resurrection life, Spirit, kingdom) and future consummation (new heavens/earth, final judgment).
- **Covenantal Fulfillment**
 - Promises to Israel find typological and ultimate fulfillment in Christ and the church within a unified covenantal plan.
- **Kingdom of God (mediatorial reign)**
 - Emphasizes Christ's present sovereign rule and the progressive outworking of that rule in history.
- **Millennium (symbolic vs literal)**
 - Frame argues for symbolic-typological status of Revelation's millennium rather than a discrete literal chronology.
- **Consummation**
 - Final eschatological act: resurrection of the just and unjust, judgment, and new creation fulfilling covenant promises.
- **Resurrection and Judgment**
 - Treated as objective, historical climaxes that secure covenantal promise and divine justice.
- **Hermeneutical presuppositions**
 - Theological commitments (covenant, Christ's reign) are essential starting points that shape proper exegesis.
- **Typology**
 - Biblical types function as real, divinely-willed anticipations fulfilled in Christ and consummated eschatologically.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a covenantal/amillennial reading of the millennium.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational literalism and isolationist Israel-church schema.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating Revelation with canonical theology.
 - As a **teaching syllabus** for seminarians learning to frame eschatology within systematic theology.
