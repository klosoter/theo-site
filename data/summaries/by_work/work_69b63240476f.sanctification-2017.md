### TITLE
Sanctification (2017) - Michael Allen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2017 amid renewed Reformed interest in holiness, union with Christ, and corrective engagements with Wesleyan and pietistic emphases. Fits in contemporary anglophone Reformed academic and pastoral milieu attentive to both confessional and systematic coherence.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Sanctification must be understood as theologically rooted in Christ's objective work and the believer's union with him, holding **definitive (positional)** and **progressive (experiential)** sanctification in a single, Christocentric frame so that ethic, covenant, and soteriology cohere.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Affirmation of a principled theology: sanctification is treated as a locus within a theological science whose principia are Scripture and the determinate doctrines of Christ and Spirit.
 - Move 1: Re-establishes Christology as the first principle for sanctification - what Christ has assumed grounds what the Spirit effects in believers.
 - Move 2: Articulates a theological anthropology under union with Christ - believers are definitively set apart even as they are progressively made holy.
 - Move 3: Shows how sacramental and ecclesial practices mediate the Spirit's progressive work without displacing the definitive reality of sanctification.
 - Move 4: Dialogues with modern theologians (Barth, Rahner) to test Reformed claims and refine a confessional alternative.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary sources: Scripture, Reformation confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg), classical Calvinian texts.
 - Interlocutors prominently engaged: Karl Barth (reformulation of Christological principle), Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), contemporary Reformed scholars and pastoral literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, union with Christ, imputation), Christology (assumption and healing), Pneumatology (application of redemption), Ecclesiology (means of grace, sacraments), Ethics (mortification and vivification), Theological method (principia / theology as science).
- **Closing line**
 - The book centers sanctification as the Spirit-wrought, covenantal participation in Christ's holiness that is both a decisive status and an ongoing moral transformation rooted in principial, Christocentric theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong insistence on a *definitive-progressive unity* - neither reduction to mere ethical progress nor to an exclusively forensic status.
 - Treats sanctification as a doctrinal locus embedded within a principled theological science (principia), not as an add-on pastoral category.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies that split Rahner/Patristic Christological rules from Protestant soteriology by reappropriating the rule ("what is assumed is what is healed") into a Reformed account of union and application.
 - Offers a sustained critique of accounts that over-privilege either sanctification as imputed/positional (legalized sanctification) or as purely transformative (Wesleyan perfectionist strains).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Coining or repeated use of phrases like **definitive-progressive unity**, **principial sanctification**, and an emphasis on "sanctification as applied participation."
- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorably received in Reformed academic circles for clarifying tensions in recent debates; used in seminary courses on soteriology and sanctification.
 - Noted for productive dialogue with Barthian and Roman Catholic categories, attracting interest from theologians seeking ecumenical convergences on Christology and the application of redemption.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, pastorally aware systematic treatment that integrates doctrine, method, and praxis - durable for both classroom and pulpit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definitive sanctification**
 - The believer's status of being set apart in Christ - a once-for-all reality ground in union with Christ.
- **Progressive sanctification**
 - The Spirit-driven moral and spiritual growth in holiness over a believer's life.
- **Definitive-progressive unity**
 - Allen's key synthetic term insisting both dimensions cohere and derive from union with Christ.
- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological ground of all soteriological application (justification, sanctification, glorification).
- **Rahner's Rule (and Barth's reformulation)**
 - Rahneric/patristic principle ("what is not assumed is not healed") taken up and reframed via Barthian Christology to argue that Christ's assumption effects sanctification for believers.
- **Principia / theology as science**
 - Methodological claim that theology proceeds from determinate first principles (Scripture and Christ) so that sanctification is treated scientifically (systematically and coherently).
- **Imputation vs. infusion**
 - Legal declaration (imputation) and real, participatory transformation (infusion) are held in balanced tension rather than opposed.
- **Mortification / vivification**
 - Traditional moral categories for how progressive sanctification operates: dying to sin and living unto Christ.
- **Means of grace / sacramental mediation**
 - Emphasized as normative channels by which the Spirit applies Christ's sanctifying benefits.
- **Covenantal participation**
 - Sanctification understood within covenantal terms - membership, promise, and responsibility.
- **Sanctification as applied participation**
 - Phrase denoting that sanctification is not only positional but participation in Christ's life by the Spirit.
- **Ethical formation grounded in doctrine**
 - Ethical exhortation derives authority from doctrinal identity in Christ.
- **Theological anthropology under grace**
 - Human transformation described in light of recreated identity in Christ, not autonomous moralism.
- **Reception use across loci**
 - Definition source: authoritative concise statement for Reformed definitions of sanctification.
 - Polemic tool: used to critique both therapeutic/pietistic and perfectionist accounts.
 - Exegetical model: framework for reading Pauline texts on sanctification and union with Christ.
 - Conceptual pivot: supplies principial method for integrating Christology, soteriology, and ethics in systematic theology.
