### TITLE
Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach - Vern Poythress (Crossway, 2006)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical engagement with science and culture. Responds to rising scientism, public debates over evolution, and growing interest in Christian academics for theology-science integration.
 - Poythress writes as a Reformed theologian/mathematician trained in both theology and science; conversant with Kuyperian/Bavinckian commitments and with contemporary philosophy of science.

- **Central thesis**
 - Science is a legitimate, God-ordained human enterprise but must be practiced and interpreted within a **Christian, God-centered worldview**; redeeming science means recovering theological foundations (creation, providence, common grace, redemption) and critiquing secularizing assumptions (scientism, metaphysical naturalism).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of the nature and practice of science: models, laws, measurement, fruitfulness.
 - Diagnosis of modern problems: reductionism, scientism, methodological naturalism treated as metaphysical creed rather than neutral method.
 - Theological resources for science:
 - **Creation** grounds intelligibility and lawfulness of nature.
 - **Common grace** explains human capacity for scientific knowledge apart from saving faith.
 - **Providence and covenant** frame the moral and teleological responsibilities of scientists (stewardship, dominion).
 - **Redemption** recovers vocational good of science under Christ's lordship.
 - Practical proposals: adopt a presuppositional, model-aware, and theologically informed methodology; resist simplistic conflicts and compartmentalizations.
 - Concluding call: cultivate Christian scientific communities and curricula that take theology seriously as constitutive, not merely advisory.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed sources: Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck, Cornelius Van Til.
 - Philosophy of science: Thomas Kuhn, Karl Popper, and model/paradigm literature (model-based science).
 - Historical scientific figures (Newton, Galileo) used to illustrate interplay of theology and science.
 - Contemporary science-theology interlocutors (critical of scientism; dialogical with moderate theistic science).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **General and special revelation**, **creation and providence**, **common grace**, **Imago Dei**, **covenant**; redemption and eschatology play a corrective/teleological role for scientific work. Trinity and Christology are implicit as grounds for lordship over cultures and vocations rather than direct technical treatment.

- **Closing line**
 - Science, rightly redeemed, becomes a faithful human vocation under Christ: intelligible, morally accountable, and theologically rooted rather than captive to secular metaphysics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Explicitly **God-centered** methodology that treats theology as constitutive of scientific reasoning (not merely supplementary).
 - Careful attention to **model-based science** and to the fallibility and provisionality of scientific models within a Christian epistemology.
 - Strong use of **common grace** to explain scientific success among believers and nonbelievers alike.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects naive conflict narratives (science vs scripture) while also rejecting accommodationist approaches that privatize theology.
 - Critiques **scientism** and the elevation of methodological naturalism to metaphysics; defends a theistic metaphysical grounding for laws, rationality, and mathematics.
 - Offers a corrective to purely apologetic treatments that use science only to defend faith; Poythress wants theology to shape how science is conceptualized and practiced.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Applies **presuppositional apologetics** and Kuyperian antithesis to the epistemology of science.
 - Synthesizes theological doctrines (creation, providence, covenant) with philosophy of science concerns (models, paradigms, explanation levels).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among Reformed evangelical academics, seminary curricula, and Christian scientists seeking a robust theological framework for their work.
 - Influential in Reformed discussions on science/faith; less engagement in secular academic philosophy of science but valued in Christian higher-education contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Practical roadmap for integrating theology into scientific pedagogy and practice.
 - Durable resource for resisting scientism while avoiding anti-intellectualism; useful for formation of Christian scientific identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered approach**
 - Theology as constitutive framework for scientific reasoning, not merely background.
- **Redeeming science**
 - Recovering science's vocation under Christ: ethical, theological, and epistemic correction.
- **Common grace**
 - Explains non-Christian scientific achievements and provides warrant for cross-confessional scientific collaboration.
- **Methodological naturalism (MN)**
 - Described as a method that can be mistakenly reified into a metaphysical commitment (scientism).
- **Scientism**
 - The ideological claim that empirical science exhausts reality and meaning; a primary target of critique.
- **Model-based science**
 - Emphasis on the role, limits, and provisional status of models and theories; science as construction of representations.
- **Creation / providence**
 - Ontological and teleological foundations for lawfulness and intelligibility of nature.
- **Covenant and stewardship (creation mandate)**
 - Moral and vocational framework for responsible scientific practice.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Basis for human rationality, creativity, and ethical accountability in scientific work.
- **Presuppositional apologetics / Kuyperian antithesis**
 - Epistemological strategy: worldviews shape interpretations of data and method.
- **Levels of explanation**
 - Recognition of distinct explanatory categories (mechanistic, teleological, historical) and their proper integration.
- **Limits of reductionism**
 - Defense of pluralistic explanatory approaches against reductive physicalism.
- **Mathematics and intelligibility**
 - Mathematical order as grounded in divine wisdom rather than autonomous Platonic realm.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed, theologically integrated approach to scientific methodology and vocation.
- As a **polemic** against scientism and philosophical naturalism in curricula and apologetics.
- As a **conceptual/heuristic model** for teaching science & faith courses, forming Christian scientists, and shaping institutional science policy and ethics.
