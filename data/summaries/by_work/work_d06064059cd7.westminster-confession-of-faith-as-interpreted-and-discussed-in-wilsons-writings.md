### TITLE
**Westminster Confession of Faith (as interpreted and discussed in Douglas Wilson's writings)** 
Author focus: Douglas Wilson - contemporary Reformed pastor and Federal Vision interlocutor; interpretive engagement with the WCF and its language about covenant, sacraments, and justification.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Original WCF: 1646; held as standard of Reformed orthodoxy. Wilson: late 20th-early 21st century American Reformed context, allied with the Federal Vision conversation (post-1990s), pastoral concern for parish life, sacramental theology, and ecclesial identity.
 - Movement: conservative Reformed revivalism with emphasis on covenantal parish ministry and critique of perceived "forensic-only" readings of justification.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Wilson reads the WCF as compatible with a robustly covenantal, ecclesial, and sacramental theology that emphasizes **union with Christ** and the objective status of covenant membership - a corrective to readings that reduce justification to a purely forensic imputation divorced from covenantal incorporation.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close reading of WCF language shows legitimate emphasis on covenantal representation (federal headship) and sacramental signs as means of grace.
 - Argues for stronger correlation between **baptismal incorporation** and the believer's status than many modern commentators allow.
 - Claims pastoral implications: assurance and church discipline must work with visible covenant realities, not merely invisible forensic decrees.
 - Stakes out a middle path: insistence on justification by faith while resisting an abstraction of justification that ignores objective union and covenantal markers.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Westminster Confession and subordinate standards; Puritan writers cited for covenantal theology.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Federal Vision proponents (e.g., Peter Leithart, Steve Wilkins) and critics (e.g., Michael Horton, PCA/OPC theologians). Wilson engages both defenders and critics of Federal Vision dynamics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, justification, union with Christ, sacraments (esp. baptism), church (visible/invisible), assurance, sanctification, imputation vs. impartation tensions.

- **Closing line**
 - Wilson's reading centers the WCF within a lived, visible covenant community: justification remains by faith, but its pastoral and ecclesial reality is apprehended through union with Christ and covenantal signs rather than abstract forensic statements alone.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Covenantal objectivity:** visible membership and sacraments bear real, not merely symbolic, relation to salvation status.
 - **Pastoral ecclesiology:** discipline, assurance, and preaching must assume an objective covenantal realm.
 - **Integrative union with Christ:** theological anthropology and soteriology tied to corporate headship and participation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that isolate forensic imputation from baptismal and covenantal realities.
 - Seeks to correct what he views as an overly individualistic, privatized Protestant soteriology.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts traditional WCF categories to foreground **present-tense covenantal status** and sacramental efficacy without abandoning forensic categories outright.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked sharp controversy (disciplinary inquiries, critiques in PCA/OPC circles) and sustained debate about how to read confessional texts in modern pastoral contexts.
 - Influential within Federal Vision and some parish renewal movements; widely disputed in mainstream conservative Reformed denominations.

- **Enduring value**
 - Forces reexamination of covenantal language in the confessions, sharpening questions about how doctrines of justification, sacraments, and church interrelate in pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Federal Vision**
 - Movement emphasizing covenantal objectivity, corporate union with Christ, and the ecclesial contours of salvation; Wilson is a prominent public voice.
- **Justification by Faith**
 - Central Reformed doctrine; Wilson insists on justification by faith but reads its pastoral expression through covenant and union.
- **Union with Christ**
 - For Wilson, the ontological ground tying justification, sanctification, and sacramental life together.
- **Covenant Objectivity**
 - The claim that covenant signs and visible membership convey a real, not merely symbolic, relation to grace.
- **Imputation vs. Impartation**
 - Debate about forensic crediting (imputation) and real possession/participation of righteousness (impartation); Wilson emphasizes complementarity.
- **Baptismal Efficacy**
 - Baptism as a means by which covenantal incorporation is signified and, pastorally, treated as creating a real standing.
- **Visible/Invisible Church**
 - Wilson stresses the pastoral necessity of treating the visible church as the arena of covenantal life while distinguishing ultimate election.
- **Forensic Justification**
 - Legal verdict language; affirmed but integrated with covenantal and participatory language.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in union and visible covenantal signs as well as faith; pastoral procedures matter.
- **Sanctification**
 - Not merely outcome of justification but bound up with covenantal life and discipline.
- **Works of Profession**
 - Public evidence within covenant community; Wilson emphasizes their pastoral importance.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against overly forensic, individualistic readings of the WCF and modern Reformed piety.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading confessional texts through covenantal and sacramental lenses.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over justification, baptism, and ecclesial practice - used both to defend Federal Vision emphases and to challenge mainstream Reformed respondents.
