### TITLE
Genesis 1-11: Myth or History? (public lectures and debates) - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical apologetic milieu; interactional forum of public lectures and debates rather than monograph. Positioned amid renewed evangelical engagement with science (origins debates) and scholarly literary-critical treatments of Genesis.
 - Craig writes as an analytic philosopher/theologian within conservative evangelicalism, engaging both biblical scholarship and natural science interlocutors.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1-11 ought not to be read as mere myth or ingeniously primitive allegory; it contains genuine historical claims-most crucially the historicity of Adam and the Fall-which have major theological consequences (original sin, imago Dei, soteriology).
 - The debate centers on how to reconcile biblical claims about origins with modern science and with historical criticism that treats early Genesis as mythic or etiological.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Genre analysis: evaluates literary features of Genesis 1-11 against criteria for myth, saga, and ancient historiography; argues that features do not force a purely mythic classification.
 - Comparative studies: examines ANE parallels (e.g., Flood narratives) and shows parallels do not automatically imply Genesis is non-historical; rather, Genesis engages and transforms ANE motifs.
 - Theological-historical argument: appeals to New Testament authors (notably Paul) who treat Adam as a historical figure; thus, early Genesis functions as theologically and historically foundational for later revelation.
 - Philosophical and apologetic considerations: uses principles like inference to the best explanation to defend miraculous events (creation ex nihilo, supernatural Fall) against naturalistic presuppositions.
 - Scientific interface: argues that accepting certain scientific findings need not compel denial of the historicity of Adam or the reality of a historical Fall; presses for models that preserve theological essentials (e.g., historical first humans) while engaging science.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Literary and historical critics of Genesis, proponents of demythologizing readings, and scientists advocating evolutionary accounts without a historical Adam.
 - Uses Second Temple and ANE parallels, Pauline theology, and modern philosophical apologetics as sources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation, Fall, original sin, imago Dei (human nature), revelation and hermeneutics, soteriology (need for redemption grounded in a real Fall), and the relation of Scripture to empirical science.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Maintaining the historicity of Genesis 1-11-especially Adam and the Fall-is indispensable for orthodox Christian anthropology and soteriology; mythologizing these chapters undermines core Gospel claims.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integrates analytic-philosophical apologetics with close theological exegesis: Craig presses philosophical standards of evidence and inference in defense of biblical historicity.
 - Strong appeal to New Testament testimony (Paul) as a hermeneutical warrant for reading Genesis historically; not merely a plea to OT internal cues.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against liberal/demythologizing readings (Bultmann-style) by arguing they break essential theological continuity with the NT.
 - Distinguishes itself from naive literalism by allowing for literary stylization while insisting on real historical referents (a middle path between rigid literalism and pure mythicism).

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes methodological role of "inference to best explanation" for historical miracles and the plausibility of supernatural events in a historical framework.
 - Frames Genesis 1-11 as "theologically charged history" rather than raw chronicle or mere myth.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical apologetics and conservative theological circles as a principled defense of a historical Adam and Fall.
 - Criticized by critical scholars and many scientific communities (and some progressive evangelicals) who press for non-historical readings or scientific models incompatible with a single historical pair.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable exemplar of integrating philosophical argumentation with biblical theology; useful for teaching on hermeneutics, the Adam/Christ typology, and Scripture-science interface.
 - Serves as a touchstone in contemporary debates over the theological necessity of a historical Adam.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Primeval history** - Genesis 1-11 as foundational narrative framing human origins and divine ordering.
- **Myth vs. history** - central binary examined; Craig nuances the categories rather than treating them as mutually exclusive.
- **Genre criticism** - literary criteria used to assess whether Genesis 1-11 must be read mythically.
- **Ancient Near Eastern parallels** - comparative material (e.g., Flood traditions) used to show literary relationship without forcing non-historicity.
- **Historicity (of Adam and the Fall)** - claim that Adam and the Fall are real historical events/actors with salvific consequence.
- **Imago Dei** - theological anthropology; historical Adam anchors the meaning of human likeness to God and sin's corruption.
- **Original sin** - doctrine tied to a real Fall; argued to be undermined by purely mythic readings.
- **Pauline hermeneutic** - appeal to NT writers (especially Paul) who presuppose Adam as historical.
- **Inference to the best explanation** - methodological principle used to argue for miracles and historic events in light of competing hypotheses.
- **Miracle (historical)** - defended as a reasonable historical claim, not philosophically impossible, within the explanatory framework.
- **Revelation and hermeneutics** - discussion of how Scripture intends to communicate history and theology.
- **Theistic evolution (contrast)** - presented as a possible but problematic model if it rules out a historical Adam; tension case study.
- **Soteriological necessity** - the idea that Christ's redemptive work presupposes an original historical sin.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against demythologizing readings and against scientific models that deny a historical Adam.
 - As an **exegetical model** that marries NT witness to OT interpretation for teaching on original sin and Christ/Adam typology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Scripture-science dialogue, illustrating how philosophical methodology can buffer orthodox doctrines while engaging scientific data.
