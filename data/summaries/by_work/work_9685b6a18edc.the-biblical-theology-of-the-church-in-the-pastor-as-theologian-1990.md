### TITLE
The Biblical Theology of the Church - Edmund P. Clowney (chapter in The Pastor as Theologian, 1990)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th-century Reformed evangelical pastoral theology. Clowney writes as a pastor-theologian shaped by Westminster and Puritan traditions, responding to pastoral needs in a modern, often institutionalized church context.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church must be understood and governed according to its biblical identity as Christ's covenant people, constituted by Word and sacraments, rather than by sociological, institutional, or purely voluntarist categories.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Biblical-theological survey tying Old Testament covenant community images to New Testament realities: people of God → Christ's body.
 - Definition of the church in covenantal and Christocentric terms: visible/invisible distinction integrated, but stress on the visible church's marks as normative for pastoral practice.
 - Identification of the church's constitutive means: the ministry of the Word (preaching), the sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper), and church discipline.
 - Ecclesial offices and structures (pastor/elder, deacon) rooted in apostolic practice and the pastoral responsibilities that flow from the church's identity.
 - Mission and eschatology: the church's present witness and sacramental life anticipate and participate in the consummation of Christ's kingdom.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary reliance on Scripture; ongoing dialogue with Reformed confessions and Puritan pastoral writers; implicit contrast with pietistic, liberal, and consumerist models of church prevalent in late 20th century.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Word as normative), covenant theology (continuity and fulfillment), Christology (Christ as head of the church), Trinity (life of the church under Father, Son, Holy Spirit), sacraments, ecclesial office, holiness and unity, mission, eschatology.
- **Closing line:** Clowney locates the church's identity and practice decisively in the covenantal, Word-centered, Christ-governed community - the gathered means of grace by which the Spirit forms and sends God's people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Biblical-theological unity:** Moves beyond patchwork ecclesiologies by tracing church identity across redemptive history; stresses continuity from Israel to the church without collapsing typology.
- **Pastoral primacy of the Word:** While affirming sacraments and discipline, Clowney gives chief place to faithful proclamation as the primary mark and means of church life.
- **Covenantal congregationalism:** Emphasizes corporate covenant as the matrix for membership, discipline, and sacraments - distinct from purely voluntarist or purely institutional descriptions.
- **Corrective to privatized Christianity:** Critiques consumerist and purely experiential definitions of church, insisting on objective means of grace and ecclesial authority.
- **Terminological clarity:** Refines the use of visible/invisible church language by tying visible marks to pastoral responsibility rather than speculative soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly regarded in Reformed pastoral circles; used in seminary courses on pastoral theology and ecclesiology; cited by pastors seeking a robust, historic Reformed account of church identity and practice.
- **Enduring value:** Offers a compact, pastorally-oriented, theologically rich framework that is pedagogically useful for training ministers and clarifying congregational practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant people:** The church as the continuation and fulfillment of Israel's covenant identity in Christ; grounds membership and corporate responsibility.
- **Visible church:** The gathered congregation with marks (preaching, sacraments, discipline); the realm of pastoral oversight and sacramental administration.
- **Invisible church:** The totality of the elect known to God; acknowledged but not the primary focus for pastoral governance.
- **Means of grace:** Word (preaching), sacraments, and discipline as God-ordained instruments by which the Spirit conveys salvation and shapes the church.
- **Word-centered ministry:** Preaching as constitutive of the church's life and the chief pastoral task.
- **Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper):** Signs and seals that confirm covenant belonging and communion with Christ; essential to church identity and practice.
- **Marks of the church:** Faithful preaching, right administration of the sacraments, and exercise of discipline - the visible proofs of a true church.
- **Church offices:** Pastors/elders and deacons as biblically instituted roles for stewardship, teaching, and care; pastoral formation oriented to these responsibilities.
- **Discipline:** Corporate practice for holiness, correction, and maintaining covenant integrity; instrumental for ecclesial witness.
- **Gathered vs. scattered church:** The gathered assembly as primary context for means of grace; the scattered life as mission outflow and daily witness.
- **Christ as head:** Christ's lordship over the church shapes governance, worship, mission, and eschatological hope.
- **Mission and eschatology:** The church's sacramental life anticipates and participates in final consummation; mission flows from covenant calling.
- **Pastoral theology:** Integration of doctrinal truth with concrete pastoral responsibilities and congregational practice.
- **Reformed confessionalism:** Use of confessional categories to interpret Scripture's teaching on church life without rigidly legalistic application.

- How this work is used:
 - As a concise **definition source** for Reformed, covenantal ecclesiology and the church's marks.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized, consumerist, or purely organizational models of church.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** linking OT covenantal imagery to NT ecclesial practice for ministerial formation.
