### TITLE
But for the Grace of God: An Exposition of the Canons of Dort - Cornelis P. Venema (Three Forms of Unity series)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Exposition of the Canons of Dort (Synod of Dort, 1618-1619) produced within the contemporary Reformed confessional renewal (Three Forms of Unity series; Reformation Heritage/RHB context).
 - Addresses enduring post-Dort controversies: Arminianism (Remonstrants), modern objections to particular redemption and divine sovereignty.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Canons, properly understood, defend the sovereign, particular grace of God in redemption and clarify the biblical doctrines of election, effectual calling, and perseverance against Arminian revisionism.
 - Venema aims to show the Canons as confessional, pastoral, and exegetically responsible rather than merely polemical pronouncements.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Systematic, article-by-article exposition of the Canons with historical notes and biblical exegesis.
 - Major moves:
 - Reconstruct historical dispute with Remonstrants; locate the Canons' judgments in Scripture.
 - Defend the coherence of the Five Heads (total depravity, unconditional election, definite atonement, effectual calling, perseverance) as theological and pastoral necessities.
 - Distinguish between types of grace (common, preparatory, effectual) and reconcile the Canons with other Reformed commitments (e.g., gospel offer).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutors: Jacobus Arminius and the Remonstrants; synodical delegates (Dutch Reformed theologians).
 - Secondary engagement with Reformed orthodoxy and modern critics; frequent biblical citation and confessional cross-reference.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Election, reprobation, sin and total depravity, atonement (particularity), calling (external vs effectual), regeneration, sanctification, perseverance, assurance, common and preparatory grace, covenant theology implications.
- **Closing line**
 - Venema situates the Canons as a disciplined, Scripture-rooted defense of sovereign grace: the Christian gospel stands as God's transforming initiative - "but for the grace of God" is both confession and theological claim.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Combines historicist fidelity to the Canons with contemporary pastoral sensitivity; repeatedly clarifies the distinction between external call and internal, effectual calling.
 - Nuanced account of preparatory/common grace: affirms non-saving divine benevolence while denying it as a ground for universal salvation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects caricatures that portray the Canons as fatalistic or hostile to evangelism; argues they presuppose active mission and a genuine universal offer of the gospel.
 - Counters Arminian readings that ascribe contingent human cooperation as decisive for election.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies classical Reformed categories for modern readers: tight operational distinctions between common grace, preparatory grace, external call, and effectual call.
 - Reframes "limited atonement" language toward biblical idioms of particular redemption and intent without crude syllogistic formulations.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches as accessible, scholarly exposition; has become a standard pastoral introduction to Dort in conservative Reformed circles.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for bridging confessional history and modern doctrinal questions; serves as a concise exegetical handbook for articles of Dort and for teaching on calling and grace.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canons of Dort**
 - The synodical judgments (1618-1619) addressing Remonstrant errors; primary text explicated throughout.
- **Five Heads (Five Points)**
 - Total depravity; unconditional election; particular redemption; irresistible/effectual grace; perseverance.
- **Unconditional Election**
 - God's sovereign choice not conditioned on foreseen faith or merit.
- **Particular Redemption (Limited Atonement)**
 - Christ's atoning intention and efficacy directed to the elect; explained in pastoral and scriptural terms rather than schematic limits.
- **Effectual Calling**
 - The internal, Spirit-wrought summons that results in regeneration and faith; distinguished from the external proclamation of the gospel.
 - Linked to the topic: **Regeneration And Effectual Calling** - Venema explicates the causal sequence and biblical basis for regeneration as God's act concomitant with effectual calling.
- **Regeneration**
 - New birth by the Spirit; necessary and sovereignly wrought antecedent to faith in the Canons' framework.
- **Common Grace**
 - Non-saving benevolence God shows to all humanity (restraints on sin, natural blessings).
- **Preparatory Grace**
 - A debated category employed to describe God's non-saving influences that may predispose persons toward the gospel without effecting salvation.
 - Linked to the topic: **Common Grace And Preparatory Grace** - Venema distinguishes these services of God, affirming common/preparatory acts while denying their salvific efficiency.
- **External Call**
 - The general, outward proclamation of the gospel offered to all; maintained alongside the doctrine of effectual calling.
- **Perseverance of the Saints**
 - The doctrine that the elect will persevere in faith through God's sustaining grace.
- **Reprobation**
 - Divine judicial decree regarding the non-elect; treated as biblically coherent with sovereign election.
- **Assurance**
 - Epistemic fruit of adoption, perseverance, and the Spirit's witness; grounded in objective promises.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise **definition and historical source** for understanding the Canons and Dort-era formulations.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Arminian reinterpretations on election, effectual calling, and the scope of the atonement.
 - As an **exegetical model** for teaching the relation of calling and regeneration and for distinguishing common vs preparatory grace in pastoral theology.
