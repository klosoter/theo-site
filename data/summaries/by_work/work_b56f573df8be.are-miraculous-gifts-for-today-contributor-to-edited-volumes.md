### TITLE
Are Miraculous Gifts for Today? (contribution) - O. Palmer Robertson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th century Reformed response to the global rise of Pentecostal/charismatic movements; contribution appears in edited volumes addressing contemporary controversies over spiritual gifts.
 - Milieu: evangelical Protestantism wrestling with experiential-charismatic claims, the authority of Scripture, and pastoral order in rapidly expanding Pentecostalism.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Robertson argues from a Reformed, covenantal perspective that the New Testament's extraordinary "sign" gifts served unique, foundational roles tied to the apostolic era and are not normative for ordinary church life today.
 - The core problem addressed: whether present-day claims to revelatory, apostolic-style gifts (tongues, authoritative prophecy, revelatory visions) are biblically warranted and ecclesiologically healthy.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Biblical-theological framing: gifts are interpreted against the canon, covenant progression, and the completion of apostolic revelation.
 - Exegetical moves: reading key NT texts (1 Corinthians 12-14; Ephesians 4:7-16; Hebrews; pastoral epistles) to show gifts functioned as signs to authenticate apostles and the inception of the church.
 - Hermeneutical principle: once the canonical revelation and apostolic foundation were complete, the exceptional, revelatory authentication functions would diminish or cease.
 - Practical-theological implications: insistence on Scripture sufficiency, primacy of Word and sacraments, and ordered worship over subjective charismatic criteria.
 - Pastoral critique: warns of doctrinal drift, ecclesial disorder, and experientialism that can supplant textual authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interlocutors: Pentecostal and charismatic advocates (continuationists), contemporary continuationist scholars, and historical proponents of continuing gifts.
 - Sources: New Testament exegesis, Reformed confessions and covenant theology, patristic and post-apostolic church history (as evidence of declining apostolic signs), and pastoral observation of charismatic practice.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and sufficiency of Scripture, Holy Spirit (gifts and operations), ecclesiology (church foundation and order), covenant theology, eschatology (inaugurated vs. consummated), sacraments, and pastoral theology.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Robertson centers a Reformed, Scripture-saturated caution: extraordinary gifts were historically and theologically tied to the apostolic foundation and therefore are not the normative criterion for contemporary ecclesial authority or doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal lens: gifts are read as temporally ordered within the covenantal economy rather than as open-ended options for all ages.
 - Integration of ecclesial order with pneumatology: emphasis that Spirit's work must be understood through the ordered means of grace (Word and sacrament).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - More exegetically nuanced than caricatures of cessationism; he engages key NT passages seriously rather than dismissively.
 - Contrasts with charismatic theology by prioritizing canon-completion and warning against post-biblical "new revelation" claims.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses the language of **foundational/authenticating gifts** to describe the historical purpose of sign gifts, clarifying the distinction between miraculous authentication and ongoing ecclesial gifts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative seminaries as a clear, compact statement of classic cessationist reasoning.
 - Used by pastors and presbyters as a pastoral-theological guide against unregulated charismatic practice; prompted responses from moderate continuationists.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, covenantally anchored model for addressing charismatic claims; valuable as an exegetical primer, pastoral caution, and ecclesiological corrective in Reformed teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism**
 - The view that certain miraculous/revelatory gifts ceased with the apostolic era; Robertson applies covenant-theology criteria to justify limitation of gifts.

- **Continuationism**
 - The opposing view that charismatic gifts continue; Robertson frames and critiques continuationist arguments.

- **Sign gifts / foundational gifts**
 - Tongues, apostleship, special prophecy as signs that authenticated apostolic ministry and the new covenant inception.

- **Scripture sufficiency (sola Scriptura)**
 - Central normative principle: Scripture is the final authority; extra-canonical revelation is treated with suspicion.

- **Normative means of grace**
 - Word and sacraments are promoted as the ordinary, ongoing means by which the Spirit ministers to the church.

- **Revelatory gifts vs. edifying gifts**
 - Distinction between gifts that communicated new revelation (restricted) and gifts that build the church (more general and enduring).

- **Apostolic foundation**
 - The theological claim that apostles laid a unique foundation for the church; tied to termination of certain authentication signs.

- **Ecclesial order / worship regulation**
 - Concern that charismatic spontaneity can undermine orderly worship and doctrinal oversight.

- **Experientialism**
 - Critical term for theology overly dependent on subjective experiences as validation of truth.

- **Authentication**
 - How divine acts authenticated apostolic message; once authentication fulfilled, its necessity diminished.

- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Used to explain the "already/not-yet" presence of miraculous phenomena without endorsing open-ended continuation.

- **Prophecy (NT)**
 - Distinguished from modern prophetic claims: NT prophecy is subject to testing and subordinate to Scripture.

- **Tongues**
 - Treated as a sign gift historically bound to early church authentication and not a normative standard.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional and polemical resource in debates on **Continuationism vs Cessationism**.
 - As an exegetical and ecclesiological model in Reformed responses to **Pentecostalism and Charismatic movements** - taught in seminary courses on pneumatology, worship, and pastoral oversight.
