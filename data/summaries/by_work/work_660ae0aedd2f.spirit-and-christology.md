### TITLE
Spirit and Christology - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century Reformed retrieval movement; post-Barthian theological conversation seeking to recover classical Trinitarian and pneumatological resources for contemporary dogmatics.
 - Webster writes as a constructive Anglican-Reformed systematician attentive to patristic, Reformation, and Barthian texts, aiming to re-establish a robust pneumatology inside orthodox dogmatics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christology is intelligible only within a pneumatological grammar: the Holy Spirit is not an optional adjunct to Christ's person and work but the constitutive agent who realizes, witnesses to, and makes present the saving work of Christ in the church and in believers.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Scriptural presentation of the Spirit as the agent of revelation, new-creation, and union with Christ.
 - Historical retrieval: Reclaims patristic and Reformed emphases that link Spirit and Christ (e.g., Spirit as bearer of Christ, Calvin's emphasis on Spirit's work of union).
 - Systematic construction: Develops a Trinitarian grammar where the economic roles of Son and Spirit are distinct yet inseparable - Spirit as agent of appropriation, Son as ground and content of revelation.
 - Ecclesial and sacramental implications: Shows how the Spirit mediates presence of Christ in Word and sacrament and grounds communion, mission, and sanctification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Barth for Christocentric dogmatics while pressing Barth to fuller pneumatological development.
 - Dialogues with Calvin and Reformed orthodox, patristic witnesses, and contemporary pneumatologists (critical of both reductionist modern accounts and some charismatic excesses).
 - Implicit dialogue with systematic trends that isolate Christology from pneumatology or reduce the Spirit to an effect rather than a person.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (economic relations and personal distinctions)
 - Christology (person, work, presence)
 - Pneumatology (person, operations, witness)
 - Revelation (Word-Spirit relation)
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments (presence and mediation)
 - Soteriology and eschatology (union, sanctification, consummation)

- **Closing line**
 - Webster centers dogmatics on the claim that the Spirit is the personal and ecclesial means by which the Son's saving reality is made present and effective - a Trinitarian vision where Christology and pneumatology mutually define one another.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on a pneumatological grammar for all doctrinal loci: doctrine of God, Christ, church, sacraments, and salvation.
 - The Spirit as primary agent of appropriation and union (not merely as an outworking of Christ's work).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Christomonistic tendencies that marginalize the Spirit by showing how such tendencies distort both Christology and ecclesiology.
 - Pushes Barthian Christocentrism toward a fuller account of the Spirit's personal agency without abandoning Christ's centrality.
 - Challenges privatized spirituality and purely experiential pneumatologies by rooting Spirit-activity in church, Word, and sacrament.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Formulates the idea of **pneumatic appropriation** (Spirit's role in making Christ's work personally present).
 - Articulates a relational grammar linking **Spirit-as-witness** with **Christ-as-content**, rather than treating Spirit as secondary effect.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in recent Reformed and Anglican theological formation; used to rebalance systematic treatments that underplay the Spirit.
 - Cited in contemporary debates about Trinitarian ordering, sacramental theology, and pastoral pneumatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a defensible model for integrating Christology and pneumatology in systematic theology.
 - Serves as a methodological exemplar for combining historical retrieval, scriptural exegesis, and constructive dogmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Holy Spirit** - personal third Person of Trinity; agent of revelation, union, sanctification, and presence.
- **Pneumatic appropriation** - the Spirit's work by which believers are brought into real participation in Christ's benefits.
- **Christology** - treated as necessarily pneumatological; the Son's identity and saving work are mediated by the Spirit.
- **Trinitarian grammar** - a methodological insistence that theological statements be formed within relational, economic Trinitarian categories.
- **Witness / Testimony** - Spirit's role in certifying and presenting Christ to faith (not merely subjective assurance).
- **Union with Christ** - central soteriological category; realized and sustained by the Spirit's indwelling and activity.
- **Word-Spirit nexus** - the dynamic by which Scripture proclaims and the Spirit authenticates/applies that proclamation.
- **Sacramental mediation** - Spirit as the agent who makes Christ present in Word and sacrament; sacramentality reinterpreted pneumatologically.
- **Eschatological presence** - the Spirit as foretaste and guarantee of consummated union with Christ.
- **Ecclesiality** - emphasis that Spirit's operations are essentially communal and church-shaped, resisting individualistic privatization.
- **Anti-Christomonism** - corrective stance against Christology that sidelines the Spirit; insists on mutual definition.
- **Personal agency** - stress that the Spirit is a person and acts as such in revelation and sanctification.
- **Reformational retrieval** - method of drawing on Calvin and Reformed tradition to undergird a renewed pneumatology.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for pneumatological roles in systematic treatments (esp. appropriation and union).
 - As a **polemic** against Christomonistic and privatizing tendencies in modern theology and spirituality.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for linking NT texts about Spirit and Son in doctrinal construction.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental and ecclesiological theology to justify a Spirit-centered account of presence.
