### TITLE
T&T Clark Companion to Atonement - edited by Adam J. Johnson 
(Contemporary T&T Clark Companion volume: interdisciplinary, ecumenical essays surveying historical, biblical, systematic, philosophical, and pastoral dimensions of atonement theology.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Contemporary, early-21st-century academic theology; part of T&T Clark Companion series aimed at synthesizing scholarly debate for research and teaching. 
 - Situated within renewed interdisciplinary interest in soteriology that engages biblical studies, historical theology, systematic theology, philosophy of religion, and global theological voices.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - Not a single monograph thesis; rather the volume argues that atonement is best understood as a **multidimensional theological complex** that must be read through Scripture, Trinitarian Christology, ecclesial practice, and historical models, resisting reduction to one paradigm.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Survey chapters mapping classical models (satisfaction, penal substitution, Christus Victor, moral influence, recapitulation). 
 - Historical retrieval of patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern treatments. 
 - Theological synthesis chapters arguing for Trinitarian and Christological groundings for atonement. 
 - Interdisciplinary essays connecting atonement to ethics, pastoral care, sacramentality, and global/colonial critiques. 
 - Concluding reflections on ecclesial and missional implications.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic and medieval authors (e.g., Gregory, Anselm), Reformers (e.g., Calvin), modern critics and proponents (e.g., Aulen, Gustaf; modern defenders of penal substitution), biblical commentators; contemporary philosophers of religion and global theologians.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Trinity and economic relations, Christology (twofold office and more), sin and human depravity, justification and forensic language, covenant theology, sacrament and ecclesiology, eschatology, reconciliation and restoration, moral and ethical dimensions.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** 
 - The Companion reframes atonement as **theologically Trinitarian, historically variegated, and ecclesially formative**, advocating plurality of models held within a coherent Christology and missionary-ecclesial horizon.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphatic interdisciplinarity: integrates biblical exegesis, history, systematic theology, ethics, and global perspectives in one resource. 
 - Stress on Trinitarian and Christological grounding rather than purely forensic accounts.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushback against exclusive reliance on penal substitution as the sole explanatory model; reframes penal language as one valid mode among others. 
 - Reassertion of Christus Victor and restoration/recapitulation motifs that earlier Protestant scholarship marginalized.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Promotion of **"multimodal" or "polyphonic" atonement** vocabulary - recognizing complementary models that answer different theological and pastoral questions. 
 - Greater precision in distinguishing **expiation vs. propitiation**, **active vs. passive obedience**, and **forensic vs. transformative** accounts.

- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Adopted in academic syllabi and cited as a go-to reference for plural-model approaches. 
 - Useful to Reformed scholars seeking to nuance penal emphases with historical and Trinitarian corrective; met with guarded appreciation by conservative quarters and enthusiasm by ecumenical and critical scholars.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Comprehensive mapping of the field; excellent entry point for graduate seminars. 
 - Durable resource for constructing integrated theological responses to contemporary pastoral and intercultural questions about atonement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Atonement (multidimensional):** integrated set of doctrines explaining Christ's saving work; not reducible to one schema. 
- **Penal substitution:** forensic doctrine that Christ bears punishment in sinners' stead; treated critically and historically contextualized. 
- **Christus Victor:** motif emphasizing victory over death, sin, and demonic powers; rehabilitated as central to early and patristic witness. 
- **Satisfaction (Anselmian):** honor-restoring model focused on satisfaction of divine justice; recovered in dialogue with other models. 
- **Moral influence:** model focusing on ethical transformation produced by Christ's life and death; discussed as complementary, not merely rival. 
- **Recapitulation:** Irenaean theme of Christ re-creating and restoring humanity by summing up human life in himself. 
- **Expiation vs. Propitiation:** distinction between removal of sin (expiation) and appeasement of wrath (propitiation); the volume presses for technical clarity. 
- **Forensic justification:** legal declaration language; examined in relation to covenantal and relational frameworks. 
- **Trinitarian economy:** grounding atonement in intra-Trinitarian relations and sending of the Son and Spirit. 
- **Active and passive obedience:** Christ's fulfillment of the law (active) and suffering/death (passive) as jointly operative in salvation. 
- **Ecclesial/sacramental atonement:** how church practices (Eucharist, preaching) embody and communicate atoning realities. 
- **Missional/transformative language:** emphasis on atonement's forward-looking, restorative, and creation-healing effects. 
- **Hybrid or multimodal model:** proposed posture of holding several complementary theories within coherent theology. 
- **Historical retrieval:** use of patristic and medieval materials to challenge modern monocultural narratives.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definitional source** for contemporary, plural-model approaches to atonement in systematic theology. 
 - As a **polemic resource** against reductionist treatments (particularly exclusive penal-only accounts). 
 - As an **exegetical and historical model** for reading biblical and patristic texts alongside philosophical and pastoral questions.
