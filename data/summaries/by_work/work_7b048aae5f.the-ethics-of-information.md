### TITLE
The Ethics of Information - Luciano Floridi (Oxford University Press, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid accelerating digital transformation, big data, AI debates.
 - Builds on Floridi's prior work (information philosophy, "infosphere" concept, papers from late 1990s-2010s).
 - Interdisciplinary milieu: philosophy of information, computer science, environmental ethics analogies, and applied ethics of technology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Moral worth and ethical concern should be extended beyond anthropocentric subjects to the **infosphere**: the whole networked environment of informational entities. Ethics must protect, preserve, and promote the flourishing of informational entities and the infosphere itself.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Ontological grounding - information as a fundamental ontological category; definition of semantic information as well-formed, meaningful, and truthful data.
 - Part II: Moral theory - defends an **ontocentric** ethics: moral patiency correlates with degree of informationality; not merely human-centered.
 - Part III: Applied ethics - applies framework to privacy, intellectual property, AI, information pollution, data practices, and policy.
 - Methodological move: uses **Levels of Abstraction (LOA)** as an analytical tool to avoid category mistakes and to compare entities across contexts.
 - Normative move: proposes principles for action that prioritize the integrity, autonomy, and flourishing of informational entities and ecosystems.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical moral theories (Kantian, utilitarian), environmental ethics (biosphere analogies), and contemporary authors in information studies, computer science, and bioethics.
 - Dialogues implicitly with anthropocentric frameworks and with techno-optimist/technocratic outlooks.

- **Doctrines / theological loci implicated**
 - Not doctrinal in a confessional sense but intersects theological concerns: **creation/ontology**, **imago Dei and personhood**, stewardship/ethics of care, responsibility for creation (extended to digital creation), and moral status of nonhuman agents.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Reorients moral concern from human-centered stewardship to an **ontocentric care for the infosphere**, a move with direct implications for theological accounts of creation, personhood, and stewardship in an age of information.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates **information** itself as morally salient; treats the infosphere analogously to the biosphere - worthy of ethical protection.
 - Uses a structural, ontological vocabulary rather than rights-only or consequence-only accounts.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges strict anthropocentrism (human-focused ethics) and narrow bioethics that neglect informational entities.
 - Contrasts with simplistic digital-instrumentalist views that treat data and devices merely as tools devoid of moral significance.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularized and systematized key terms: **infosphere**, **inforg** (informational organisms/agents), **ontocentrism**, and **Levels of Abstraction (LOA)** as normative-analytic tools.
 - Recasts privacy, IP, and agency in informational terms (e.g., information integrity, information pollution).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in information ethics, digital humanities, and philosophy of information.
 - Increasingly cited in theological and religious ethics conversations about AI, digital personhood, and stewardship, though uptake in confessional traditions varies.
 - Served as a conceptual bridge for interdisciplinary curricula on ethics of technology.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Offers a coherent, portable framework for assessing moral problems raised by data, networks, and AI.
 - Provokes theological reflection on extending doctrines (creation, imago Dei, responsibility) into the infosphere; useful as a teaching pivot for seminar discussions and case studies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Infosphere**
 - The informational environment encompassing all informational entities and processes; analogue of the biosphere for information.

- **Inforg**
 - An informational organism or agent - any entity whose identity and functioning are significantly informational (humans, some AI, informational artifacts).

- **Semantic information**
 - Floridi's working notion: **well-formed, meaningful, and truthful data** (as opposed to mere data or noise).

- **Ontocentrism**
 - Ethical stance granting moral consideration according to the degree to which entities exist as informational beings, not solely by species membership or sentience.

- **Levels of Abstraction (LOA)**
 - Methodological device to frame and compare descriptions/analyses of systems at different granularities; prevents category errors in ethical assessment.

- **Information integrity**
 - The well-formedness, accuracy, wholeness, and reliability of information as an ethical good to be preserved.

- **Information pollution**
 - Degradation of the infosphere through misinformation, disinformation, spam, or harmful data practices that reduce overall informational quality.

- **Moral patiency of artifacts**
 - The idea that artifacts and data structures can be moral patients (objects of moral consideration), depending on their informational status.

- **Informational flourishing**
 - Normative aim: the preservation, enrichment, and respectful interaction with informational entities and the infosphere.

- **Informational rights / duties**
 - Rights and duties reframed for the infosphere (e.g., rights to informational integrity, duties to avoid information pollution).

- **Informational agency**
 - Recognition that some systems (advanced AIs, distributed systems) may function as agents within the infosphere at particular LOAs.

- **Privacy as informational self-determination**
 - Privacy reframed in terms of control over one's informational representation and integrity within the infosphere.

- **Data justice**
 - Equity concerns about access to, control of, and harms from information; aligns with ethical duties to the infosphere.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - **Definition source**: standard reference for precise definitions of "information," "infosphere," and related concepts in ethics of tech.
 - **Conceptual pivot**: employed to shift discussions in theology and ethics from anthropocentrism to broader ontological concern for informational creation and stewardship.
 - **Polemic/tool**: used to critique rights-only or narrowly utilitarian approaches to digital ethics and to propose alternative policy frameworks.
