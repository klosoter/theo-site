### TITLE
Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account - Paul R. Hinlicky

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary dogmatic theology (late 20th-early 21st c.). Situated within renewed interest in classical theism and debates about the coherence of traditional attributes of God in modern analytic and post-Enlightenment theology.
 - Dialogues with both historical scholasticism and recent critics (analytic philosophers, process theologians, some strands of 20th-century Protestant theology).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The classical doctrine of **divine simplicity** is defensible and theologically necessary when properly understood as a dogmatic (revelatory) claim rather than a purely speculative metaphysical axiom.
 - Main problem addressed: how to preserve God's unity and aseity without collapsing Trinitarian relationality or making God unintelligible in light of revelation in Christ.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Begins by diagnosing modern rejections of simplicity (from philosophical and existential objections).
 - Reframes simplicity as a theological principle grounded in Scripture and the Christ-event rather than independent metaphysical speculation.
 - Demonstrates how simplicity secures other central divine attributes (aseity, immutability, eternity) and prevents idolatrous bifurcations of God.
 - Shows compatibility of simplicity with Trinitarian distinctions: relationality within the divine life is not numerical composition but personal relations within undivided divine being.
 - Applies the doctrine to theological loci: revelation, incarnation, providence, and worship, insisting that simplicity underwrites the intelligibility of God's self-disclosure.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical voices: Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas (as touchstones for traditional resources).
 - Modern and contemporary interlocutors: analytic philosophers of religion critical of simplicity, process theologians, and 20th-century theologians (Barthian critiques of classical metaphysics are addressed sympathetically and critically).
 - Scripture and Christology as primary authorities for reinterpreting classical categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, eternity, omnipotence, omniscience).
 - Trinity (economic and immanent relations), Christology (incarnation and the unity of divine-human person), revelation, creation and providence, divine freedom.

- **Closing line**
 - Simplicity, rightly dogmatized through the lens of revelation in Christ, is both a safeguard of theological coherence and a necessary corrective to modern theological compromises.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a **revelation-first** reading: simplicity is a theological presupposition grounded in God's self-disclosure (Christ) rather than an a priori metaphysical thesis.
 - Marries classical metaphysical categories with dogmatic, scriptural priorities-avoids pure scholasticism or pure fideism.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects reductive modern accounts that abandon simplicity for psychological or processual images of God.
 - Counters readings that treat Trinitarian relations as incompatible with simplicity by clarifying personal relations as non-compositional relations within one simple being.
 - Offers measured critique of Barthian anti-metaphysical moves: affirms Barth's commitment to revelation while pressing for recovery of certain classical metaphysical insights.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Proposes a careful distinction between **ontological multiplicity** (composition) and **personal relationality** (Trinitarian relations) within a simple divine being.
 - Reframes traditional attributes as **theological predicates** anchored in Christological revelation rather than as mere philosophical predicates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in confessional and academic circles that seek a bridge between classical theism and contemporary dogmatics.
 - Cited as a corrective in debates over kenosis, process thought, and analytic critiques; used by theologians aiming to reintegrate classical categories into Protestant dogmatics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, dogmatically sensitive resource for safeguarding divine unity while taking seriously Trinitarian and incarnational commitments.
 - Useful for instructors and students who need a theologically robust, accessible defense of a contested classical doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity** - God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's simple being, understood theologically through revelation.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; Hinlicky links aseity to simplicity as a theological corollary grounded in Scripture.
- **Immutability** - God's unchangeableness; defended without denying relational dynamism in the economy of salvation.
- **Eternity** - God's mode of being beyond temporal succession; treated as compatible with temporal acts in providence.
- **Attributes-as-predicates** - Attributes are theological predicates derived from the one divine being rather than separable parts.
- **Trinitarian relations** - Personal relations within the Godhead; presented as non-compositional, preserving unity and distinction.
- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity** - Distinction retained but recalibrated so economic acts disclose, rather than add to, immanent being.
- **Christological grounding** - Simplicity is read through the person and work of Christ; revelation is hermeneutical key.
- **Analytic critique** - Modern philosophical objections (e.g., to identity of attributes) are engaged and redirected toward theological priorities.
- **Kenosis/process critiques** - Alternatives that posit divine passibility or ontological change are argued against insofar as they undermine aseity and unity.
- **Metaphysics vs. Dogmatics** - Insists on a disciplined interaction: metaphysical language is serviceable but must be subordinated to dogmatic claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching classical doctrines of God within Protestant dogmatics.
- As a **polemic** against process theology, radical kenoticism, and certain analytic rejections of simplicity.
- As an **exegetical-model pivot**: reading Trinitarian and Christological texts in light of a theologically informed simplicity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical conversations aiming to reconcile scholastic metaphysics with scriptural dogmatics.
