### TITLE
Ordo Salutis or Historia Salutis? Reformed Perspectives on the Structure of Paul's Theology - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Pauline Theology, Vol. 2 (ed. D. A. Carson, 1991)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1991 in a multi-author volume arising from late 20th-century evangelical interest in recovering biblical-theological (Pauline) approaches to doctrine.
 - Situated within Reformed evangelical theological circles reacting to both overly schematic systematic theologies and to redemptive-historical movements that can sideline doctrinal ordering.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Ferguson interrogates whether the Reformed tradition should prioritize an **ordo salutis** (systematic/logical order of salvation) or a **historia salutis** (redemptive-historical, chronological unfolding) when construing Paul's theology.
 - He argues for a mediated position: canonical-historical priority (Christ's saving acts) grounds the ordo, but the ordo retains legitimate systematic and pastoral utility.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Brief exegetical survey of Pauline texts to show Paul's own blending of event-centered and doctrinal reasoning (e.g., justification grounded in Christ's death/resurrection; sanctification in union with Christ).
 - Critique of an abstracted ordo that becomes chronological claim about intra-soul sequencing rather than theological description of how salvation is accomplished in Christ.
 - Defense of the ordo as a reflective theological tool that must be disciplined by redemptive-historical realities; the history (Christ's work) must govern the order.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: preaching, assurance, catechesis require both historic anchoring and logical clarity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Reformed confessional tradition implicitly (Calvinian emphases on union with Christ, covenantal order) and engages contemporary Pauline-theology debates (redemptive-historical interpreters and systematicians).
 - Dialogues with evangelical theologians concerned with biblical theology and with systematic theologians who work within ordo frameworks.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (justification, sanctification, glorification), union with Christ, calling and regeneration, election, covenant theology, the centrality of the Christ-event (incarnation, death, resurrection).
 - Methodological concerns in biblical theology and systematic theology.
- **Closing line**
 - Ferguson's center: **the saving acts of Christ (historia salutis) must be the controlling horizon for any ordo salutis; the ordo is legitimate as a disciplined theological and pastoral ordering that serves, not supplants, the historical gospel.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced methodological stance**
 - Not a wholesale rejection of ordo salutis; instead insists the ordo must be tethered to redemptive history and Christological priority.
- **Christocentric redemptive-historical check**
 - Elevates the concrete events of Christ's work as normative for both exegesis and systematic ordering-avoids abstract psychological sequencing.
- **Pastoral sensitivity**
 - Stresses how doctrinal ordering affects preaching, assurance, and pastoral care; theological models must be pastorally responsible.
- **Correction to extremes**
 - Pushes back on two errors:
 - Systematic reductionism that treats ordo as a rigid, soul-level timeline.
 - Redemptive-historical excess that dissolves doctrinal clarity and the usefulness of ordered categories.
- **Terminological clarity**
 - Clarifies the proper *uses* of ordo and historia rather than inventing new categories-making the debate tractable for Reformed teaching.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed seminaries and evangelical discussions as a corrective synthesis-used in courses on soteriology, Pauline theology, and homiletics.
 - Reinforced the move among many Reformed scholars to integrate biblical-theological narrative with systematic formulation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a pragmatic hermeneutic for combining exegesis and doctrine; durable for teaching church practices (sacraments, catechesis) that require both history and order.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ordo salutis** - The logical/systematic ordering of the stages of salvation (calling, regeneration, justification, sanctification, glorification); defended as a useful theological tool when subordinated to redemptive history.
- **Historia salutis** - The concrete, historical acts of God in Christ (incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension); affirmed as the primary controlling horizon.
- **Christocentric priority** - The principle that Christ's saving work governs both biblical exposition and doctrinal ordering.
- **Union with Christ** - Central Pauline category that links historia and ordo: events in Christ ground the sequence of applied salvation.
- **Justification** - Treated as forensic/exegetical result grounded in Christ's act rather than merely a point in a psychological sequence.
- **Sanctification** - Understood as both present reality and progressive fruit tied to union with Christ; cannot be isolated from the historical accomplishment.
- **Calling / Regeneration** - Discussed as loci where the ordo language easily misleads if taken chronologically rather than theologically.
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic** - Method that reads doctrines in the narrative of God's saving acts; Ferguson insists it must inform, not erase, systematic ordering.
- **Systematic theology** - Seen as necessary but servant to biblical narrative; ordo salutis belongs here as disciplined reflection.
- **Pastoral application** - The practical domain (preaching, assurance, catechesis) where the ordo/historia interplay is most consequential.
- **Covenantal soteriology** - Background theological frame that helps bridge event and order in Reformed readings of Paul.
- **Exegetical restraint** - The caution that one should not derive a rigid inner chronology of salvation from scattered Pauline texts.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for distinguishing and relating ordo salutis and historia salutis within Reformed theology.
- As a **polemic/temper** against both systematic abstraction and redemptive-historical reductionism.
- As an **exegetical-model** that integrates Pauline texts into a Christ-centered theological sequence for preaching and doctrine.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary curricula linking biblical theology and systematic soteriology.
