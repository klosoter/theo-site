### TITLE
Paul and the Trinity
Wesley Hill

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical academic milieu (mid-2010s). Responds to renewed interest in Trinitarian theology within evangelical and Anglican circles and to ongoing Pauline scholarship that sometimes sidelines Trinitarian patterning.
 - Intersections of New Testament exegesis, constructive theology, and pastoral/liturgical concerns.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's theology is fundamentally **Trinitarian in shape**: the Father, Son, and Spirit form an interpersonal matrix that grounds identity, salvation, prayer, and ecclesial life. Recovering this Trinitarian pattern clarifies Pauline theology and corrects readings that treat Father, Son, and Spirit as abstract agents or interchangeable categories.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close exegesis of Pauline texts to show recurrent relational grammar:
 - Paul's salutations, doxologies, and prayers regularly locate believers **from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit** (and variants), indicating distinct personal roles and mutual indwelling.
 - Language of **gift (charis/charisma)** and divine sending links persons: God gives the Son, the Spirit is given, believers receive filiation and gifts.
 - **Union with Christ** and **participation in the Spirit** are read as personal/relational realities rather than purely soteriological statuses.
 - Moves from textual patterns to theological claims: interpersonal Trinitarian relations constitute the grammar for Christian existence and ecclesial practice.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Paul (Romans, Galatians, 1-2 Corinthians, Philippians, Colossians).
 - Engages broadly with Pauline scholarship, patristic/traditional Trinitarian resources, and contemporary Trinitarian theologians (implicitly dialoguing with both social and classical models).
 - Pastoral and liturgical sources used to illustrate lived Trinitarian language.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity**, **Christology**, **Pneumatology**, **Soteriology**, **Union with Christ**, **Adoption/Filiation**, **Ecclesiology**, **Divine agency**, **Prayer/doxology**, and the theology of gifts.

- **Closing line**
 - Paul's apostolic language invites a theology that sees the Christian life as formed within the interpersonal giving of Father, Son, and Spirit - a Trinitarian matrix that is exegetically grounded and pastorally formative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Centers **gift language** (charis/charisma) as the hermeneutical hinge connecting Trinitarian persons in Paul.
 - Prioritizes the **relational/person-centered** aspects of Trinitarian disclosure over abstract metaphysical categories.
 - Pays sustained attention to Paul's liturgical/doxological rhetoric as windows onto Trinitarian theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that reduce the Spirit to impersonal power or treat "in Christ" language as merely forensic or juridical.
 - Corrects metaphysically heavy Trinitarian constructions by returning to Pauline grammatical patterns as primary theological data.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Recasts Pauline motifs (sending, giving, reception) as a coherent Trinitarian economy of persons rather than discrete doctrinal loci.
 - Uses the language of interpersonal **gift-exchange** to articulate perichoretic relations in Paul's frame.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Gained traction among evangelicals and Anglican scholars seeking a biblically anchored Trinitarian theology attentive to pastoral life.
 - Valued by scholars wanting an exegetical entry-point into social/perichoretic Trinitarian models without abandoning textual fidelity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a succinct exegetical corrective and teaching resource that models how Pauline texts can be read Trinitarianly without importing extrabiblical metaphysics.
 - Useful for integrating pulpit, liturgy, and classroom theology around the relationality of divine persons.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **"In Christ"**
 - Central Pauline locution reinterpreted as relational participation within the Son-person of the Trinity.
- **"In the Spirit"**
 - Marks participation and empowerment by the Spirit as personal, not merely functional.
- **Father**
 - Source language: origin, sender, and giver in Paul's relational grammar.
- **Son / Jesus Christ**
 - Mediatorial person through whom believers are formed and to whom gifts are traced.
- **Spirit**
 - The personal presence that effects union, empowerment, and reception of divine filiation.
- **Gift / charis / charisma**
 - Theological hinge: divine persons give and sustain life; gifts mediate Trinitarian relations to believers.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Relational union that is enacted by the Spirit and grounded in the Father's gifting of the Son.
- **Adoption / filiation**
 - Social status conferred within the Trinitarian family; a relational identity, not merely legal.
- **Sending / apostello**
 - Structural motif: persons act in relation (Father sends Son, Father and Son send Spirit), showing ordered interpersonal economy.
- **Doxology / prayer formulae**
 - Textual loci that reveal Paul's trinitarian pattern (e.g., salutations and benedictions).
- **Divine agency**
 - Multiform agency located in persons rather than impersonal divine forces.
- **Participation**
 - Describes how believers partake in the life of the triune God through gift-mediated relations.
- **Perichoresis (implicit)**
 - While not foregrounded as philosophical technicality, the mutual indwelling of persons is present in Paul's relational language.
- **Ecclesial formation**
 - The community is constituted and sustained as a Trinitarian gift-receiving body.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Exegetical model: as an example of reading Pauline texts with Trinitarian sensitivity grounded in textual patterns.
 - Polemic/corrective: against impersonal pneumatologies and reductionist readings of "in Christ".
 - Conceptual pivot: supplies gift-relational vocabulary for constructing pastoral and ecclesiological applications of Trinitarian doctrine.
