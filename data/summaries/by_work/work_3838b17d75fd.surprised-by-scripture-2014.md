### TITLE
Surprised by Scripture (2014) - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-2010s; Wright writing as a prominent Anglican New Testament scholar and public theologian. Situated within post-evangelical, historically-minded Protestant scholarship that seeks to navigate tensions between traditional doctrine, historical criticism, and contemporary science.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Wright aims to recover a Scripture-shaped reading that resists modern caricatures (both fundamentalist literalism and dismissive liberal historicism). On Adam specifically, the problem addressed is how to understand Paul's use of Adam (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) - as a historical individual, a theological typus, or a mythic construct - and what that means for doctrines of sin, representation, and human origins.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - exegetical: close reading of Paul shows Paul employs Adam as a covenantal/historical representative - the "one man" who functions as a head for humanity.
 - theological: Paul's Adam-Christ parallel requires a concept of representation (federal headship) but Paul is not making a scientific claim about biological descent in modern terms.
 - hermeneutical: Genesis must be read in its ancient narrative and covenantal context; theological claims about Adam should not be forced into modern categories (e.g., population genetics, Young Earth chronology).
 - pastoral/apologetic: biblical faithfulness does not demand rejection of mainstream science; rather, it demands careful reading of Scripture's genres and apostolic theology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Paul (primary focus: Romans, 1 Corinthians); Genesis traditions; patristic and Reformation interpreters (implicit contrasts with Augustine/Calvin-type readings); contemporary evangelical critics (Young Earth creationists) and broader scientific discourse.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, Scripture and hermeneutics, covenant theology, original sin (and its transmission), Christology (Adam-Christ typology), anthropology, creation.
- **Closing line:** Wright situates Adam within biblical covenantal and typological thinking - a historically rooted representative figure for Pauline theology - while cautioning against reading Genesis through modern scientific or naïve literalist lenses.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - stresses **covenantal/representative** categories rather than mechanistic metaphysics to explain Adam's role in Pauline theology.
 - insists on the **primacy of apostolic theology** (Paul's theological intent) over later systematic extrapolations when interpreting Genesis-Adam.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - corrective to Young Earth literalists: rejects simplistic literal chronology and anti-scientific claims.
 - corrective to liberal de-mythologizers: refuses to reduce Adam purely to myth or literary fiction; affirms a historically meaningful role in apostolic thought.
 - contrasts with some Reformed reductions that treat federal headship as an abstract metaphysical transaction divorced from covenantal context.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - reframes "federal headship" within a robust **narrative-covenant typology** rather than as a standalone forensic mechanism.
 - emphasizes the distinction between **historicity as theological necessity** and historicity as modern historiography.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - widely used among mainline and many evangelical readers seeking a middle way between fundamentalism and liberalism.
 - criticized by strict conservative Reformed and Young Earth proponents for perceived equivocation on literal historicity and biological monogenism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - serves as a model for integrating New Testament exegesis with contemporary cultural-scientific concerns while preserving theological weight of Adam/Christ typology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam:** Wright reads Paul's Adam as a real representative ("one man") in Israelite tradition - historically significant for Paul's argument, though not a point to be read through modern scientific categories.
- **Federal headship (representation):** central category - Adam functions as humanity's representative; Wright emphasizes covenantal and relational aspects of representation.
- **Historicity:** treated carefully - Wright distinguishes between theological historicity (needed for Paul's argument) and modern historiographical demands (not identical).
- **Typology (Adam-Christ):** Wright foregrounds typological reading: Adam as foreshadowing Christ's representative act; typology anchors Paul's soteriology.
- **Original sin:** reinterpreted through corporate solidarity and covenant breach rather than an explanatory mechanism tied to biological inheritance alone.
- **Imputation:** used in a covenantal/representative sense - Wright prefers relational language over abstract forensic metaphysics when explaining how Adam's action affects humanity.
- **Covenant language:** key hermeneutical frame - creation and humanity are located within covenantal patterns that inform Paul's use of Adam.
- **Genre/ancient narrative:** emphasizes reading Genesis as ancient narrative/poetry with theological aims, not modern scientific reporting.
- **Pauline exegesis:** methodologically decisive - Paul's theological intent is the lens for understanding Adam's role.
- **Monogenesis vs polygenesis:** Wright cautions against forcing NT theology into modern population genetics; he leaves open dialogue with science while defending theological claims.
- **Hermeneutics of Scripture:** advocates a Scripture-shaped reading attentive to apostolic context.
- **Pastoral sensitivity:** applies the debate to congregational teaching, discouraging unnecessary conflict between faith and science.
- **Theological anthropology:** develops a view of humanity marked by covenantal representation and corporate responsibility.

How this work is used across loci:
- as an **exegetical model** for reading Paul's Adam-Christ typology in Romans and 1 Corinthians;
- as a **polemic** against Young Earth literalism and anti-scientific hermeneutics;
- as a **conceptual pivot** in debates over original sin, representation, and compatibility with evolutionary science.
