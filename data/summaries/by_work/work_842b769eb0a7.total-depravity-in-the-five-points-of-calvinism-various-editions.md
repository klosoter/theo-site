### TITLE
**"Total Depravity" - Anthony Hoekema** 
(in The Five Points of Calvinism; various editions)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed theological renewal; pastoral and apologetic restatement of the classic five points of Calvinism for pastors, students, and lay readers.
 - Hoekema writes within the Dutch Reformed historiographic and confessional stream, aiming for clear exposition rather than novel systematic innovation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human nature is so affected by Adamic sin that, apart from sovereign grace, people are unable to seek or choose God; all faculties (intellect, will, affections) are corrupted though not destroyed.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: clarifies "total" as pervasive (affecting all parts of the person) not absolute (not the same as being as evil as possible).
 - Scriptural warrant: appeals to Romans (esp. chapters 1-3; 5), Ephesians 2, Psalm 51, and Pauline anthropology to show universal guilt and inability.
 - Phenomenology of corruption: sin's effects on knowledge (darkened understanding), volition (enslavement to sin), affections (disordered loves), and conscience (seared or enslaved).
 - Moral culpability: despite incapacity to choose God, humans remain fully responsible for sin.
 - Relationship to grace: total depravity sets the necessity for efficacious, sovereign saving grace (prevenient vs. irresistible grace tensions are noted).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Augustine and Calvin (historical Reformed); critics include Pelagianism, Semi‑Pelagianism, and Arminian formulations that assert sufficient natural ability or prevenient grace in a libertarian sense.
 - Secondary interlocutors: contemporary compatibilist and libertarian accounts of freedom; confessional Reformed authors (Berkhof, Bavinck) as background.
 - Site citation: discussion linked to the topic cluster "Sin And Free Will."
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (original sin, imago Dei), soteriology (necessity of grace, union with Christ), grace (common vs. saving), and the doctrine of the will (bondage of the will).
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema's treatment locates the doctrinal pivot of Reformed soteriology: pervasive human corruption that preserves moral responsibility and thereby drives the need for sovereign, effectual grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Careful linguistic distinction: "total" = comprehensive, not totalizing annihilation of good capacity; retains a pastoral restraint against caricaturing human nature.
 - Strong pastoral concern: balances sober depiction of corruption with pastoral confidence in Christ's redeeming restoration of the image of God.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Pelagian/Arminian tendencies that soften the inability claim by asserting unaided capacity to respond.
 - Distinguishes itself from some hyper-Calvinist rhetoric by insisting on continued human responsibility and the retained albeit distorted imago Dei.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Stresses the useful pair "natural inability" vs. "moral inability" as clarifying human impotence before God without excusing guilt.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches as an accessible, conservative exposition; functions as a standard mid‑20th century popularizing of classical doctrines rather than a programmatic revision.
- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically strong: concise, pastorally sensitive, and clarifying for students encountering debates on freedom and grace; remains a common concise reference for the classic Reformed formulation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Total depravity** - sin's pervasive effect on all aspects of human nature; not total annihilation of capacities.
- **Total inability** - inability to choose God or perform saving good apart from divine intervention.
- **Moral inability** - inability grounded in will's corruption rather than in external constraint.
- **Imago Dei (marred, not lost)** - image of God remains in humans but is distorted by sin; basis for continued dignity and responsibility.
- **Original sin / inherited corruption** - Adam as federal head; corruption transmitted to all descendants.
- **Bondage of the will** - classical Augustinian/Calvinist notion: the will is bound to sin until liberated by grace.
- **Prevenient grace (contrast)** - grace that precedes decision; Hoekema distinguishes common or preparatory actions of God from the particular efficacious grace effecting salvation.
- **Irresistible / efficacious grace** - grace that effectively transforms the depraved will; soteriological consequence of total depravity in Reformed scheme.
- **Common grace** - God's non‑saving restraint and benefaction that preserves order and enables culture despite depravity.
- **Responsibility / culpability** - despite inability, humans are fully blameworthy; incapacity does not absolve.
- **Pelagianism / Semi‑Pelagianism** - historical errors opposed by Hoekema's account; both understate the need for sovereign grace.
- **Arminianism** - interlocutor emphasizing prevenient enabling; Hoekema contrasts with Reformed insistence on inability and divine initiation.
- **Scriptural loci** - Romans 1-3, 5; Ephesians 2; Psalm 51 used as exegetical foundations.
- **How this work is used**
 - Definition source: concise Reformed definition for classroom and sermon preparation.
 - Polemic: standard concise rebuttal against Pelagian and Arminian claims about innate ability.
 - Exegetical model: practical guide to linking Pauline anthropology to soteriology in teaching and curriculum.
