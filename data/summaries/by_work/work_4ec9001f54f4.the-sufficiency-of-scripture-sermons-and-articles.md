### TITLE
The Sufficiency of Scripture (sermons and articles) - John F. MacArthur

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th to early 21st century evangelical milieu; MacArthur writing from a conservative Reformed-evangelical pastorate (Grace Community Church) and The Master's Seminary.
 - Polemical context: rise of Pentecostal/charismatic movements and prosperity/experience-centered forms of evangelicalism; also internal debates over inerrancy and hermeneutics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture alone is fully sufficient as the final, authoritative norm for theology, doctrine, worship, and Christian living; claims to continuing revelatory authority (private prophecy, tongues as normative) are unnecessary and dangerous.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural foundation: explicit appeals to biblical texts asserting sufficiency, clarity, inspiration, and finality of Scripture (e.g., 2 Tim 3:16-17; Heb 1:1-3).
 - Pneumatological boundary: distinction between the Spirit's work in producing and illuminating Scripture versus ongoing revelatory gifts as normative for the church.
 - Exegetical case against modern charismatic practice:
 - Historical-critical reading of New Testament gift lists and apostolic-office context.
 - Functional and redemptive-historical arguments for cessationism (apostles and prophets as foundational, not perpetual offices).
 - Practical/pastoral consequences: warnings about doctrinal drift, emotionalism, and ecclesial disorder when extra-biblical revelation is elevated.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Direct polemic with contemporary Pentecostal and charismatic leaders and publications.
 - Engagement with earlier Reformed authorities implicitly (e.g., Calvin, Westminster tradition) and with 20th-century evangelicalists on inerrancy and authority.
 - Critical appropriation of biblical scholarship to support cessationist and sola scriptura claims.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs. general), inspiration, inerrancy, sufficiency, clarity of Scripture.
 - Pneumatology (role of Holy Spirit vis-a-vis Scripture; charismatic gifts).
 - Ecclesiology (authority, order, ministry offices).
 - Hermeneutics and pastoral theology (preaching, counseling, doctrinal formation).
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on a robust defense of sola scriptura: the Bible alone, understood and taught faithfully, is sufficient to equip the church and to expose and correct extra-biblical claims to authority.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - A pastoral, sermonic tone that links doctrinal sufficiency to congregational health and pastoral responsibility.
 - Forceful assertion that the Holy Spirit's normative ministry is to bear witness to Scripture, not to produce new, authoritative revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts sharply with Pentecostal/charismatic claims of ongoing revelational parity with Scripture; opposes experientialism and subjectivism.
 - Corrects perceived laxity in some evangelicals that accommodates extra-biblical prophecy or miraculous expectation without rigorous biblical criteria.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Popularization of a clear cessationist framework for church practice: differentiating foundational apostolic revelation from non-foundational current phenomena.
 - Re-articulation of sufficiency in pastoral terms: sufficiency as shaping preaching, discipline, counseling, and worship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles; contributed to renewed cessationist literature and seminars.
 - Provoked strong rebuttals from Pentecostal and charismatic scholars; intensified debate on gift-interpretation and ecclesial practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, pastorally oriented synthesis of the biblical case for sufficiency and a practical manual for pastors confronting charismatic claims.
 - Useful as a clear exemplar of evangelical polemical theology that prioritizes exegesis and pastoral implications.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture alone as the final rule for faith and practice; MacArthur stresses its sufficiency.
- **Sufficiency of Scripture** - The Bible contains all instruction necessary for life and godliness; no new revelation required.
- **Inerrancy/inspiration** - Scripture as verbally and fully inspired and without error; foundational to the sufficiency claim.
- **Cessationism** - The view that certain revelatory and sign gifts (apostleship, prophecy, tongues as normative) ceased after the apostolic era.
- **Continuing revelation** - Treated as a theological error when claimed to have parity with Scripture; critiqued as unstable and subjective.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit and Scripture)** - The Spirit's normative role is illumination and application of Scripture, not ongoing new doctrine.
- **Experientialism** - Emotion/experience as an unreliable epistemology for doctrine; contrasted with objective biblical authority.
- **Apostolic foundation** - Distinguishes foundational apostolic revelation from contemporary charismatic expressions.
- **Hermeneutical fidelity** - Emphasis on careful exegesis, grammatical-historical method, and doctrinal coherence.
- **Ecclesial order** - Orderly worship and ministry rooted in biblical norms; corrective against charismatic disorder.
- **Pastoral sufficiency** - Use of Scripture as the reservoir for preaching, counseling, and church discipline.
- **Prophecy (private vs. public)** - Private prophetic claims are treated skeptically; public prophetic function tied to apostolic era.
- **Authority (normative vs. descriptive)** - Scripture normative; charismatic manifestations often presented as descriptive phenomena needing biblical critique.
- **Doctrine of revelation** - Special revelation finalized in Christ and Scripture; no supplemental revelation required.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **polemic** and training resource against Pentecostal/charismatic practices within conservative evangelical circles.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for preaching and church governance that centers Scripture as both sufficient and authoritative.
