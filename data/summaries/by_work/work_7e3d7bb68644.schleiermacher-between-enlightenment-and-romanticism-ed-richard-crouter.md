### TITLE
Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (ed. Richard Crouter) - Friedrich Schleiermacher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th-century Germany, transitional moment between Enlightenment rationalism and Romantic subjectivism. Crouter's edition collects Schleiermacher's formative essays, lectures, and fragments that anticipate the 1799/1806 theological project.
 - The milieu: post-Kantian epistemology, Pietism's decline, rising historicism and cultural theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be reconstructed from the primary datum of religious consciousness: the **feeling of absolute dependence**. Dogmatic systems grounded in metaphysical proof are insufficient; religious knowledge is experiential and expressive.
 - Implicitly addresses how God relates to history, knowledge, and moral evil within a finite, dynamic world.

- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Diagnose: Enlightenment rational proofs and Romantic subjectivity each miss the proper locus of theology.
 - Reconstruct: Identify and analyze the structure of religious feeling as both epistemic and normative.
 - Apply: Re-interpret doctrines (God, revelation, Christ, church) as expressions of this fundamental feeling rather than metaphysical propositions.
 - Practical theology: correlation of Christian faith with modern culture (education, ethics, public reason).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Kant (epistemic limits), F. Schleiermacher's Romantic contemporaries (Novalis, Schelling), Enlightenment theologians and pietistic practice. Crouter's apparatus highlights textual variants and historical placement.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (reconceived as conscious encounter), Christology (as ultimate religious exemplar and revelation of God), pneumatology (religious feeling), ecclesiology (community as locus of mediated feeling), epistemology of religion, and moral theology concerning evil and providence.

- **Site usages (five topical references)**
 - **Divine Foreknowledge, Providence & Problem of Evil**: Schleiermacher downplays mechanistic providence, framing divine agency as relational and formative within history rather than exhaustive micro-control.
 - **Theodicy & Divine Justice**: Reframes theodicy: evil analyzed psychically and socially; divine justice becomes moral telos rather than metaphysical vindication.
 - **Open Theism & Divine Condescension**: His language of divine self-limitation and the incarnation has been read by some as proto-open-theist or as a distinctive model of divine condescension.
 - **Epistemology & Knowledge of God**: Primary locus is religious feeling; knowledge of God is not propositional deduction but participatory awareness.
 - **Common Grace & Preparatory Grace**: Cultural and moral goods in secular life are seen as preparatory conditions for Christian faith-Schleiermacher's account of natural religion and Bildung informs debates on common/preparatory grace.

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher relocates theology from metaphysical proof to finite persons' existential consciousness, making doctrine expressive of a felt, historically mediated dependence on the divine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as hermeneutics of religious feeling; priority of subjectivity without collapsing into relativism.
 - Emphasis on historical-cultural formation (Bildung) as ecclesial and theological task.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects Enlightenment rational theology by refusing abstract proofs; corrects unbridled Romanticism by insisting on intersubjective norms and the church as mediating institution.
 - Contrasts classical theodicies by focusing on moral and developmental accounts of evil rather than metaphysical justification.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as epistemic foundation.
 - Re-descriptive use of traditional terms (revelation, providence, grace) as existential-expressive categories rather than metaphysical predicates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Deep influence on liberal Protestantism, modern hermeneutical theology, and theology of culture. Contested by conservative and orthodox traditions for theological minimalism; appropriated selectively by contemporary debates (e.g., open theism, theological aesthetics).

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for correlating faith and modern culture, a nuanced account of religious knowledge, and a resource for pastoral theology and apologetics that aim to engage modern subjectivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - foundational religious datum; cognitive and evaluative.
- **Religious consciousness** - the structure through which God is known; intersubjectively confirmed.
- **Revelation (expressive)** - God disclosed in the depth of religious life and Christ's person, not primarily propositional content.
- **Providence (relational)** - divine guidance conceived as formative, moral influence rather than deterministic control.
 - Related to debates on foreknowledge and theodicy: emphasis on relational governance mitigates a mechanistic theodicy.
- **Self-limitation / Condescension** - God's kenotic-like involvement; source for readings sympathetic to open theism and sacramental presence.
- **Common grace / Preparatory grace** - secular culture and moral goods as God's preparatory work enabling receptivity to the Gospel.
- **Bildung (formation)** - cultural and personal formation as theological task; intersects with pedagogy and church practice.
- **Christology as exemplar** - Christ reveals the ultimate religious consciousness and unifies individual feeling with communal forms.
- **Hermeneutical theology** - theology as interpretation of lived religious experience rather than proof-driven systematics.
- **Theodicy reframed** - evil understood within ethical-developmental narrative rather than metaphysical reconciliation.
- **Epistemic primacy of experience** - religious knowledge primarily experiential, yet communicable through doctrine and liturgy.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: foundational for discussions of religious epistemology and the felt ground of theology.
 - Polemic: mobilized against metaphysical theodicies and rationalist proofs; used to defend a subjective-turn in doctrine.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: serves as a pivot for readings that reframe providence, grace, and divine agency in relational/formation terms.
