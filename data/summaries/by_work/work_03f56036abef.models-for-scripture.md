### TITLE
Models for Scripture - John Goldingay

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical academic milieu; conversation with canonical criticism, historical-critical method, and pastoral/communal uses of Scripture.
 - Goldingay writes as an Old Testament specialist committed to both rigorous critical scholarship and ecclesial theological use.

- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture should be approached through a plurality of *models* that illuminate different dimensions of its identity and authority; no single metaphor (e.g., Scripture as proposition or as mere human artifact) is adequate. Theologically informed, canon-conscious models best serve the church's reading and use of the Old Testament.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Introduces and defines a set of heuristic models for understanding Scripture (legal, narrative, prophetic, wisdom, cultic, covenantal, canonical, etc.).
 - For each model:
 - Describes the model's gains for grasping certain texts or functions of Scripture.
 - Identifies limitations or distortions if used exclusively.
 - Shows how models interact and compensate for one another in responsible theological reading.
 - Advocates a method that balances historical-critical sensitivity with canonical and ecclesial theological application.
 - Argues that the Old Testament becomes Scripture within the life of God's people and under Christological and Trinitarian horizons (without reducing OT to mere proof-texts).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogues implicitly and explicitly with:
 - Brevard Childs (canonical criticism and theological reading of the OT).
 - Historical-critical practitioners (as foil for overly reductive readings).
 - Evangelical defenders of inerrancy and classic confessional views (as interlocutors for authority concerns).
 - Broader biblical-theological tradition (von Rad, G. Vos, and modern OT scholarship).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (how God's self-disclosure is mediated through diverse forms).
 - Authority and canon (scripture's normative status arises from communal and covenantal life).
 - Covenant theology (central to interpreting Old Testament forms).
 - Indirectly touches on Christology and Trinitarian reception - how OT texts function in Christian confession.

- **Closing line**
 - Goldingay's center of gravity: Scripture is best understood as a plurality of interlocking modes of divine speech and communal formation; theological reading in the church needs model-aware, historically informed, and canonically shaped practice.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Metaphorical and model plurality - deliberate refusal of a single, totalizing model for Scripture.
 - Strong pastoral/communal concern: Scripture's identity emerges in worshiping, covenantal communities, not merely in academic reconstruction.
 - Old Testament specialist perspective; shows concrete application of models to OT genres and theology.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against:
 - Reductionist propositionalism (Scripture = set of abstract propositions).
 - Radical historical skepticism that strips the OT of theological authority.
 - Overly monolithic canonical approaches that underplay genre-differentiation and historical situatedness.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of "models" as analytical and pedagogical tools rather than metaphysical claims about Scripture's essence.
 - Emphasis on the interplay between genre-sensitive exegesis and theological usage.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received among evangelicals seeking robust OT theology that is both critical and confessional.
 - Influential in seminary curricula for courses on biblical theology, hermeneutics, and OT theology.
 - Cited as a corrective to extremes on both liberal-critical and fundamentalist sides.

- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogical clarity for teaching how to read Scripture faithfully.
 - Methodological framework that fosters interdisciplinary dialogue (exegesis, theology, worship).
 - Durable resource for integrating academic OT scholarship with church practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Model(s) for Scripture**
 - Heuristic metaphors/modes (legal, narrative, prophetic, wisdom, cultic, covenantal, canonical) for grasping different aspects of Scripture's function.

- **Canonical criticism**
 - The approach that stresses the final form and function of texts within the canon and community.

- **Theological use**
 - Reading aimed at shaping faith and practice within the believing community rather than only reconstructing past events.

- **Covenant**
 - Central structuring category for Old Testament theology and for understanding Scripture's relational dynamics.

- **Genre-sensitivity**
 - Attention to legal, narrative, lyrical, prophetic, and wisdom forms as determinative for meaning and use.

- **Revelation / Inspiration**
 - Framed as divine action that operates through human genres and communal reception; not reducible to propositional formulas.

- **Authority**
 - Normative status of Scripture that emerges from canonical shape and ecclesial appropriation.

- **Historical-critical method**
 - Treated as necessary for understanding texts' origins but insufficient by itself for theological use.

- **Worship / cultic model**
 - Emphasizes Scripture's liturgical origins and ongoing role in shaping communal worship.

- **Narrative model**
 - Scripture as story that forms identity; valuable for theological imagination and ethical formation.

- **Prophetic model**
 - Scripture as confronting the present, critique of power, and carrier of covenantal accountability.

- **Wisdom model**
 - Scripture as practical instruction for living within God's order.

- **Christological reception**
 - How OT texts are read and fulfilled within the New Testament and church confession (treatment is cautious, not reductive).

- Uses across loci:
 - Pedagogical definition source for hermeneutics and OT theology courses.
 - Polemical resource against both naive inerrancy and corrosive skepticism.
 - Exegetical model for integrating genre, history, and theological application in biblical theology.
