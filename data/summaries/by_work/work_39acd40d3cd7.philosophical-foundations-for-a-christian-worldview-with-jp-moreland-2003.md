### TITLE
**Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview** (ed. J. P. Moreland & William Lane Craig, 2003)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early-21st-century evangelical-analytic milieu; aimed at providing a systematic, philosophically rigorous underpinning for Christian theism in response to late modern naturalism and scientism. Intended for pastors, advanced students, and academic theologians engaging philosophy of religion, metaphysics and science-religion questions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A coherent Christian worldview requires philosophical foundations: metaphysical commitments (God as ultimate reality), epistemic warrant for religious belief, and an account of divine action compatible with scientific knowledge - especially when interpreting Genesis 1-11 and the early chapters' relation to modern science.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: Metaphysical grounding - arguments for theism and classical attributes of God as the best explanatory foundation for reality, rationality and moral values.
 - Part II: Epistemology - rationality of religious belief, critique of strict evidentialist or naturalist epistemologies, and defenses of theistic knowledge.
 - Part III: Science and Scripture - methodological naturalism, models of divine action, and hermeneutical options for Genesis 1-11 (compatibilist frameworks are presented alongside critiques of strict concordism and naïve literalism).
 - Part IV: Ethics, human nature and teleology - implications of theism for human dignity (image of God), moral ontology, and teleological explanations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Contemporary analytic philosophers of religion and theologians; interlocution with methodological naturalists, scientism proponents, Young-Earth creationists, and liberal critical scholars. Classical sources (Augustine, Aquinas) are appealed to for metaphysical resources; modern analytic tools (transcendental and modal arguments) are heavily used.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (nature and epistemic status), creation (including Genesis 1-11 and its relation to scientific cosmology/biology), providence and divine action, anthropology (imago Dei), sin (as metaphysical and moral problem), and implications for theology proper and Christian apologetics.
- **Closing line:** The volume aims to show that a philosophically respectable and scientifically-informed Christian worldview can be articulated: God functions as the metaphysical and epistemic ground for reality, science and Scripture can be held in constructive relation, and Genesis 1-11 must be interpreted within a theologically sensitive philosophical framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Analytic precision applied to traditional Christian doctrines; emphasis on showing that Christian theism is not only theologically coherent but philosophically preferable to naturalism.
 - Persistent use of transcendental-style arguments (God as necessary precondition for rationality, laws of nature, and moral facts).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against simplistic conflict models of science vs Scripture; critical of both scientism and fundamentalist concordism.
 - Corrects reductive naturalism by arguing that scientific explanations presuppose metaphysical commitments that theism better secures.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Treating "worldview" as a unified philosophical system rather than merely a patchwork of doctrines; integrating modal metaphysics with theological claims about creation and providence.
 - Nuanced taxonomy of models for divine action that move beyond miracle-versus-law dichotomy.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical academic and apologetic contexts as a go-to handbook for theistic philosophy; galvanized further work on the coherence of Christian metaphysics and on theology-science relations.
 - Criticized by some theologians for remaining too philosophically oriented and by some scientists/creationists for insufficient engagement with specialist empirical claims.
- **Enduring value:** A durable resource for teaching and defending a philosophically robust Christian worldview; valuable for students seeking principled ways to read Genesis 1-11 in dialogue with contemporary science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christian worldview:** A systematic set of metaphysical, epistemic and moral commitments grounded in theism.
- **Metaphysical grounding:** The claim that God is the ultimate explanatory basis for reality, laws, and persons.
- **Transcendental argument:** Argument that certain features of experience (rationality, morality) presuppose God.
- **Methodological naturalism:** The scientific stance restricting explanations to natural causes; critiqued and re-evaluated in relation to theological explanations.
- **Divine action:** Models explaining how God acts in the world without undermining scientific explanation or laws.
 - Sub-terms: non-interventionist objective divine action, concurrence, miracle as suspension or re-description of laws.
- **Concordism vs. non-concordism:** Approaches to relating Genesis 1-11 with scientific claims; volume favors plural, philosophically-informed hermeneutics over crude concordism.
- **Genesis 1-11 hermeneutics:** Treated as theologically primary texts requiring philosophical mediation when aligned with scientific narratives of origins.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Philosophical-anthropological account linking personhood, moral agency, and metaphysical status.
- **Philosophical theism:** Classical attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, aseity) defended with analytic tools.
- **Evidentialism vs. properly basic belief:** Epistemic dispute over justification of religious belief; the volume articulates defences of rational theistic belief.
- **Naturalism / Scientism:** Targeted philosophical opponents; critiqued for failure to provide ultimate explanations.
- **Miracle:** Re-conceptualized in light of metaphysical and scientific frameworks.
- **Worldview integration:** Using philosophy to harmonize biblical doctrine and scientific knowledge.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what constitutes a coherent Christian philosophical worldview.
- As a **polemic** against metaphysical naturalism and scientism in apologetics and philosophy of religion.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for theology-science engagement, offering hermeneutical options for Genesis 1-11 rather than a single exegetical resolution.
