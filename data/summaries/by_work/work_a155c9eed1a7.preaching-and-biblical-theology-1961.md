### TITLE
**Preaching and Biblical Theology (1961)** - Edmund P. Clowney

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 1960s Reformed-evangelical milieu. Reaction to homiletical fashions that separated exegesis from the Bible's redemptive-historical center; emerging interest in biblical theology within Reformed seminaries.
 - Clowney writes from a pastoral-homiletical vantage, aiming to equip ministers trained in confessional Reformed settings for sermon work that honors the Bible as unified revelation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Effective preaching must be grounded in biblical theology: every sermon's text must be read and proclaimed as part of the single redemptive-historical drama centered on Christ and covenant, not as isolated moral or topical material.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnose: contemporary preaching too often fragments Scripture (proof-texting, topical moralizing, individualistic application).
 - Method proposed: a biblical-theological hermeneutic that reads each text canonically and covenantally, locating it in salvation-history and showing its relation to Christ and the consummation.
 - Homiletical moves:
 - careful exegesis that discerns the text's place in the covenantal storyline;
 - typology and promise-fulfillment as legitimate interpretive tools;
 - application shaped by covenant identity (what this text means for the visible covenant community);
 - pastoral implications for preaching office, sacraments, and discipline.
 - Practical appendix: sketch of sermon forms and pastoral uses (e.g., catechesis, sacramental preaching).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on the Reformed biblical-theological tradition (notably Geerhardus Vos-style redemptive-historical concerns) and mid-20th-century evangelical homiletics. Critiques both liberal historical-critical reduction and piecemeal topical evangelicals.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canonical and Christ-centered), covenant theology (promise/fulfillment pattern), Christology (centrality of Christ in OT and NT), ecclesiology (preaching's role in forming the covenant people), sacramental theology implicit in treatment of preaching and covenant signs.
 - Explicit application to pastoral office and church order (see notes on polity below).

- **Closing line**
 - Preaching that truly serves Scripture is biblical-theological and Christ-centered: it reads each text within God's one saving purpose and thus forms covenant people through proclamation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence that homiletics be inseparable from biblical theology rather than an add-on; preaching as canonical-covenantal exposition rather than merely moral instruction.
 - Application anchored in covenant identity: sermons form the church by calling hearers into the covenant story, not only into private piety.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects topical/therapeutic preaching that abstracts texts from redemptive history.
 - Distinguishes itself from liberal historical-critical approaches by affirming canonical unity and theological coherence across Testaments.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Practical adaptation of "redemptive-historical" reading to sermon construction and pastoral praxis; explicit linkage of homiletics to ecclesial offices and discipline.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical homiletics as an early, clear statement tying biblical theology to preaching practice; shaped subsequent generations of preachers and homiletic curricula.
 - Served as a bridge for those in Presbyterian and Reformed contexts seeking to recover covenantal, Christocentric preaching.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to move from exegetical insight to covenantal proclamation; invaluable for training pastors charged with preaching, sacraments, and church discipline within confessionally Reformed churches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - Reading Scripture as unified history of redemption; basis for sermonic framing.
- **Redemptive-historical / Christocentric preaching**
 - Every text is shown to point toward Christ and the consummation.
- **Covenant**
 - Primary theological grid for connecting texts, forming application, and understanding church life.
- **Typology and promise-fulfillment**
 - Legitimate hermeneutical tools to show continuity between Testaments.
- **Canonical reading**
 - Emphasis on the Bible as canon rather than isolated units for eclectic use.
- **Application as covenant formation**
 - Application that shapes corporate identity (visible church) and discipleship rather than merely private ethics.
- **Office of the ministry / pastoral preaching**
 - Preacher's role tied to ordained office: proclamation, teaching, oversight; sermons serve the church's pastoral governance.
 - Site usage 1: informs understanding of **Church Government - Presbyterian polity (Offices, Discipline)** by locating preaching within the responsibilities of ordained elders/pastors (teaching, governance, and disciplining the covenant community).
- **Visible and invisible church**
 - Distinction retained but preaching is directed primarily to the **visible covenant community**: ministry shapes visible membership while recognizing ultimate consummation in the invisible assembly.
 - Site usage 2: used to clarify how proclamation addresses the visible church's life while maintaining theological realism about the invisible church.

- **Narrative unity / eschatological consummation**
 - Sermons should culminate in the eschatological hope that gives the present life meaning.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **practical exegetical model** for sermon construction that integrates biblical-theological insight with homiletical form.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology and polity discussions: anchors the duties of pastoral offices (teaching, discipline) in covenantal proclamation for the visible church.
- As a **polemic** against topical, non-canonical preaching and as a **definition source** for redemptive-historical homiletics in Reformed training programs.
