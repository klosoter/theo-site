### TITLE
New Testament Exegesis (methodological insights applied to the Spirit's role in Christ's ministry and resurrection) - Gordon D. Fee

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical scholarship; handbook aimed at students and pastors (multiple editions; methodological synthesis reflecting late 20th-early 21st century biblical studies).
 - Fee writes from an evangelical, broadly charismatic perspective with strong commitments to historical-grammatical exegesis and theological reading of Scripture.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Exegesis must recover authorial intention by careful attention to text, context, grammar, and theology; applied to pneumatology, this means clarifying how NT authors portray the Spirit as the active agent in Jesus' ministry, anointing, and raising from the dead.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Methodological framework: establish the text (text-critical work), determine historical context, analyze literary and grammatical features, perform semantic/lexical studies, synthesize with theological (canonical) concerns.
 - Applied steps to pneumatological data:
 - Identify key passages (e.g., Lukan infancy narratives, baptism scenes, Isaianic anointing motifs, Romans 8:11; 1 Peter, Acts).
 - Examine verbal and agency language (Greek pneuma, en, epi, ho pneumatos ho anastellō) and syntactic patterns that indicate agency vs instrumentality.
 - Compare parallel usage across Pauline and Johannine corpora to avoid proof-texting.
 - Situate within early Jewish/Christian backgrounds (prophetic anointing, Spirit as life-giver).
 - Major methodological move: prioritize the NT authors' theological claims (canonical theology) after establishing historical-linguistic data.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages mainstream historical-critical scholarship (lexica, grammars), Pauline interpreters, Johannine studies, and recent pneumatological interpreters.
 - Dialogues with both cessationist critics and charismatic proponents by privileging careful exegesis over theological precommitments.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit as agent, anointing, baptism, gifts)
 - **Christology** (Spirit's role in Jesus' messianic identity and ministry)
 - **Soteriology / Resurrection** (Spirit as life-giver, Spirit-raising of Christ and believers)
 - **Ecclesiology** (Spirit and community empowerment)
 - **Hermeneutics** (authority, canonical reading)

- **Closing line**
 - Fee insists that rigorous, context-sensitive exegesis shows the NT portrays the Spirit not as a metaphor or mere symbol but as the personal, active agent who anoints Jesus for ministry and participates in his resurrection - a claim that must be argued from grammar, context, and theology together.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Methodologically integrates lexical, syntactic, and theological work rather than treating theology as an afterthought.
 - Stresses the NT's agency-language for the Spirit (active, personal, causal) and resists attenuating readings that reduce the Spirit to impersonal force.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against reductionist or metaphorical readings of pneumatology prevalent in some liberal scholarship.
 - Counters sloppy proof-texting in both cessationist and overly speculative charismatic literature by enforcing methodical exegesis.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies distinctions such as **agency vs instrumentality** language in Greek and insists on nuanced translation choices (e.g., "the Spirit raised Jesus" vs. "God raised Jesus by/through the Spirit").

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries as a primary handbook; influential among those seeking responsible charismatic theology.
 - Cited across traditions for method rather than sectarian conclusions; shapes many contemporary NT treatments of Jesus' Spirit-anointing and resurrection.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical template for exploring pneumatological claims in the Gospels and Paul; indispensable for anyone arguing for the Spirit's real, causative role in Christ's ministry and resurrection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneuma (Spirit)** - lexical range; Fee emphasizes personhood and agency in NT contexts.
- **Anointing (Christos/unction)** - links Isaianic messianic texts to Jesus' empowerment; method requires intertextual proof.
- **Baptism in the Spirit / Spirit-baptism** - syntactic and contextual indicators of empowering vs positional use.
- **Spirit as agent (ho pneuma praēgei/ektisei)** - grammatical markers that identify the Spirit as the actor in key clauses.
- **Spirit-raising (ho pneuma anastas)** - key Pauline expression (e.g., Rom 8:11) analyzed for causal force.
- **Agency vs instrumentality** - methodological distinction used to determine whether text attributes direct action to the Spirit or uses the Spirit as means.
- **Paraclete** - Johannine portrayal; Fee reads relational and functional roles of the Spirit in relation to Jesus and the community.
- **Lexical-semantic method** - Fee's insistence on careful word-study within corpus and context.
- **Canonical synthesis** - moving from historical-linguistic findings to theological integration across NT books.
- **Contextualized intertextuality** - seeing Jesus' anointing through the lens of Jewish prophetic/Isaianic traditions.
- **Historical-grammatical hermeneutic** - Fee's baseline method.
- **Theological-linguistic priority** - concluding theological claims only after disciplined linguistic work.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for rigorous exegetical procedures when studying pneumatology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading texts that attribute resurrection and ministry actions to the Spirit.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over the Spirit's ontological agency (used by both scholarly and pastoral interlocutors).
