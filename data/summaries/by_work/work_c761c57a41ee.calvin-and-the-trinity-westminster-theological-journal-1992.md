### TITLE
Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "Calvin and the Trinity," Westminster Theological Journal (1992). 
Concise bibliographic tag: Gaffin examines Calvin's Trinitarian theology with specific attention to questions that bear on contemporary debates over eternal functional subordination.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship, post-war interest in retrieval of classical orthodoxy; situated amid renewed attention to Trinitarian theology and rising contemporary debates about intra‑Trinitarian relations (later framed as "Eternal Functional Subordination" issues).
 - Gaffin writes as a confessional Reformed theologian aiming to clarify Calvin's position for doctrinal and polemical use.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Calvin should be read as a thoroughly orthodox Trinitarian: he affirms equality of essence and will among the persons while articulating an order grounded in origin and in the economic mission, not an eternal inequality of will or power.
 - The primary problem addressed: whether Calvin's language supports an EFS account (an everlasting subordination of the Son's will/function) or whether his texts instead preclude such a view.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey of Calvin's major Trinitarian passages (Institutes, commentaries), showing consistency across his corpus.
 - Distinguishes Calvin's treatment of:
 - **Order of origin (ordo originum)** - eternal relations (begetting, procession) that constitute personal relations without implying inequality of essence or will.
 - **Order of missions / operations (ordo operum / economic order)** - temporal sending, obedience, and role in redemption that do not map onto eternal subordination.
 - Emphasizes Calvin's insistence on the unity of divine will and power: differences in role are not differences in will or freedom.
 - Uses patristic and scholastic categories as Calvin deploys them; reads Calvin against readings that conflate economic submission with an ontological subordination.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: John Calvin (Institutes, commentaries). Secondary appeal to patristic tradition and Reformation hermeneutic patterns as Calvin read Scripture.
 - Interlocutors: modern interpreters who extract hierarchical ontologies from Calvin (implicit critique), and those in contemporary debates over EFS.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central focus), Christology (relation of Son's obedience and will), revelation and Scripture as authority for Trinitarian confession, relation of immanent/economic Trinity.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Calvin maintains the unity of God's essence and the equality of the divine persons while legitimately distinguishing eternal relations of origin from temporal missions - a framework that resists reading Calvin as an advocate of eternal functional subordination.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Tight coupling of Calvin's exegetical practice with classical distinctions (immanent vs economic Trinity; order of origin vs order of operations), showing Calvin as conservative of patristic categories.
 - Strong insistence on **unity of will and power** in God as decisive for rejecting ontological EFS readings.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that conflate Christ's obedient role in redemption with an eternal personal inferiority; contrasts Calvin with interpreters who treat economic roles as indicative of intra‑divine inequality.
 - Rehabilitates Calvin against charges of tacit subordinationism by careful textual context and historical theology.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Clarifies Calvin's use of terms such as "submission," "obedience," and "order" so they refer primarily to economic reality or to relations of origin without implying a divided will.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Important corrective within Reformed circles against using Calvin to underpin EFS claims; frequently cited in debates over the doctrinal status of intra‑Trinitarian role language.
 - Has shaped subsequent Reformed defenses of classical orthodox formulations of the Trinity in both academic and confessional contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful historical-grammatical reading of a major Reformer on a topic often read anachronistically; valuable for teaching Calvin, for Trinitarian doctrine courses, and for polemical clarity in contemporary intra‑Christian debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** - the modern thesis that the Son is eternally subordinate in role/will; Gaffin argues Calvin does not teach this.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God in himself; Gaffin stresses Calvin preserves equality here.
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history; Calvin distinguishes this from the immanent.
- **Order of origin (ordo originum)** - relations like begetting and procession that are eternal but do not imply inequality.
- **Order of operations / missions (ordo operum / economic order)** - temporal sending/obedience (e.g., Son's incarnational obedience), not an index of eternal subordination.
- **Unity of will / potentia** - Calvin's recurrent claim that will and power are one in God; used by Gaffin to reject ontological subordination.
- **Submission / obedience (in Calvin)** - primarily references incarnate, economic submission of the Son; voluntary and temporal, not an eternal disparity of will.
- **Circumincession / perichoresis** - mutual indwelling; Calvin's language affirms interpenetration without hierarchy of essence.
- **Relationes (relations)** - personal relations grounded in origin; for Calvin, these are real but do not carry inferiority.
- **Subordinationism** - classical error of denying equality of essence; Gaffin shows Calvin avoids this.
- **Voluntas (divine will)** - used to highlight Calvin's doctrine of one will in God.
- **Scriptural exegesis (John, Philippians, Hebrews)** - Gaffin reads Calvin's commentary on key texts to demonstrate Calvin's consistent handling of Son's obedience as economic.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition/source** for reading Calvin's Trinitarian commitments in doctrine-history and systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** resource against contemporary EFS readings that appeal to Reformation authority.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how to read Reformation texts on Trinity with attention to classical categories and the immanent/economic distinction.
