### TITLE
The Lord's Prayer - Joachim Jeremias

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th-century Protestant biblical scholarship; Jeremias (German Lutheran New Testament scholar) writes within the historical-critical and form-critical milieu with strong philological attention to Semitic (Aramaic) sources and synagogue practice. English translations and reception broadened influence in the 1950s-1960s.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Lord's Prayer can only be properly understood by reconstructing its Semitic background and its Sitz im Leben in Jewish prayer life; each petition expresses an eschatological and communal reality introduced by Jesus rather than a generic model of private piety.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reconstructs an Aramaic Ur-form of the prayer and compares Synoptic texts (Matthew/Luke) and early church tradition.
 - Locates the prayer in Jewish synagogue formulas and in Q/Jesus' teaching, showing continuity and distinctive Christian reinterpretation.
 - Treats each petition in turn, arguing for an **eschatological** reading (kingdom, daily bread as future/eucharistic provision, forgiveness as reciprocal communal ethic).
 - Emphasizes the prayer's function: formation of community identity, ethical formation (forgiveness), and orientation to God's coming reign.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Rabbinic and pre‑rabbinic Jewish liturgy, Mishnah/Talmudal parallels, Palestinian Aramaic phrases, Synoptic Gospels, form-critical interlocutors (scholars of Gattung and Sitz im Leben). Engages modern exegetes who treat prayer existentially or allegorically.
- **Doctrines treated:** Prayer theology, eschatology, Christology (implicit - Jesus as inaugurator), ecclesiology (communal dimensions), soteriology/forgiveness, liturgy and sacramental language (by implication).
- **Closing line:** Jeremias situates the Lord's Prayer as Jesus' compressed announcement of the coming reign of God that shapes communal life - a historically rooted, eschatological prayer serving as both confession and ethic for the nascent church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong philological reconstruction of an Aramaic original; reads petitions through Palestinian Jewish liturgical and linguistic contexts.
 - Persistent insistence on **eschatological** meaning for central petitions (kingdom, daily provision, final deliverance).
 - Treats forgiveness as reciprocal and constitutive of Christian community, not merely private absolution.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against purely existential or overly spiritualized readings (e.g., Bultmannian existentialism) by restoring concrete historical and liturgical roots.
 - Contrasts with readings that interpret "daily bread" only materially - argues for layered senses including eschatological/communional dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Renewed attention to the Aramaic "Urtext" as interpretive key.
 - Clarifies the semantic range of contested Greek terms (notably "epiousios") through Semitic parallels.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely adopted as a standard historical-exegetical resource across Protestant traditions; influenced liturgical renewal and catechetical treatments of the prayer.
 - Cited in sacramental debates where Jeremias' reading of "daily bread" and communal forgiveness is marshaled in discussions of the Lord's Supper, presence, and practices of fencing/admission (Jeremias used as exegetical background rather than systematic sacramentalist).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Model of careful historical-linguistic exegesis applied to a central Christian text; exemplary in showing how prayer theology, ethics, and eschatology interrelate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Aramaic Ur-text:** Jeremias' reconstruction of the Prayer's Semitic original that clarifies ambiguous Greek terms.
- **Epiousios:** Central contested term (usually translated "daily"); Jeremias argues for an eschatological/need-oriented sense that informs eucharistic and providential readings.
- **Kingdom (of God):** Read as imminent eschatological gift inaugurated by Jesus; not merely moral rule.
- **Daily bread:** Layered meaning - daily sustenance, eschatological provision, and a connection to shared table/communion in some readings.
- **Forgiveness/Remission:** Reciprocally structured; forgiveness received presupposes forgiving others - ethical and ecclesial, not only forensic.
- **Lead us not into temptation:** Interpreted within eschatological testing and community trials rather than abstract philosophical temptation.
- **Hallowed be Thy name / Thy will be done:** Corporate, liturgical petitions aligning earthly life with God's coming reign.
- **Synagogue liturgy / Jewish prayer parallels:** Background sources used to illuminate form and function.
- **Eschatological petition:** Jeremias' term for petitions that point forward to God's consummation.
- **Communal/disciplinary dimension:** The prayer shapes who may belong and how the community disciplines and forgives (relevance to fencing/admission debates).
- **Petition structure:** Jeremias' analysis of the prayer's internal order and theological logic.
- **Historical-critical exegesis:** Method exemplified by Jeremias - philology + Sitz im Leben + comparative Judaism.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus' prayers historically and linguistically.
- As a **resource** in sacramental/liturgical debates (e.g., arguments about the Lord's Supper, presence, and practices of fencing and admission), supplying a historically grounded sense of "daily bread" and communal forgiveness.
- As a **polemic tool** against purely existential or decontextualized readings of the Lord's Prayer.
