### TITLE
**Christian Dogmatics: Reformed Theology for the Church Catholic - Scott Swain & Michael Allen**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed recovery seeking to articulate a robust, confessionally Reformed dogmatics that is explicitly "church catholic."
 - Written in the context of renewed interest in classical dogmatics, ecumenical retrieval, and pastoral application within Reformed churches and seminaries.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Reformed theology properly understood is both distinctively covenantal and essentially catholic: its dogmatics must be trinitarian, Christ-centered, ecclesial, and sacramental rather than merely individualistic or purely forensic.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prolegomena: Scripture, revelation, authority of creeds and confessions.
 - Doctrine of God: classical theism shaped by Trinity, attributes, and personal relations (perichoresis).
 - Creation, providence, anthropology, and fall.
 - Christology: incarnation, offices (prophet/priest/king), atonement, and communicatio idiomatum.
 - Salvation: election, union with Christ, justification, sanctification - covenantal and sacramental lenses.
 - Pneumatology: Spirit's role in appropriation of redemption and sacramental efficacy.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: church as covenant community; baptism and Lord's Supper as means of grace.
 - Eschatology: consummation in Christ and the church's catholic hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Heavy retrieval of Augustine, the Reformers (especially Calvin), Reformed scholastics, and patristic sources.
 - Contemporary interlocutors include evangelical, Roman Catholic, and Orthodox voices; engagement with modern Protestant currents (pietism, dispensationalism, revivalist individualism).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, Trinity, Christology, covenant theology, election and predestination, justification and union with Christ, sanctification, sacraments, ecclesiology, law and gospel, creation/fall, eschatology.

- **Closing line**
 - The book contends that authentic Reformed dogmatics is trinitarian, covenantal, and ecclesial - doctrinally rigorous yet oriented to the sacramental life and unity of the church catholic.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Explicitly labels Reformed dogmatics as "for the church catholic," stressing catholicity, creeds, and the visible, sacramental church.
 - Makes **union with Christ** and **covenant** the organizing theological lenses rather than an isolated forensic justification.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects tendencies in some contemporary Reformed and evangelical circles toward privatized soteriology, minimizing sacraments and ecclesial mediation.
 - Pushes back against reductionist accounts of justification that divorce forensic declaration from real participation in Christ.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims and rearticulates classical terms (e.g., communicatio idiomatum, covenant of works/grace) in contemporary theological vocabulary aimed at both academy and church.
 - Framing dogmatics as explicitly "church catholic" is treated as a methodological pivot - doctrines articulated for the life and worship of the historic church.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and by pastors as a recent comprehensive statement of confessional Reformed theology.
 - Praised for clarity, pastoral sensitivity, and ecumenical tone; critiqued by some for confessional commitments that limit critical historical or pluralistic engagement.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a modern exemplar of constructive confessional dogmatics: theological retrieval + pastoral application.
 - Valuable for training pastors, framing confessional identity, and fostering ecumenical conversations from a Reformed standpoint.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (federal)**
 - Central organizing category: covenant of works/ covenant of grace; frames salvation history and ecclesial life.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Not merely legal; ontological and participatory - the locus for justification, sanctification, and sacramental life.
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration inseparable from union with Christ and covenantal receipt of grace.
- **Sacramental realism**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper as true means of grace (spiritually efficacious), resisting mere memorialism.
- **Trinity / Perichoresis**
 - God's unity and interpersonal life shape all doctrines, especially revelation, mediation, and church life.
- **Mediator / Offices of Christ**
 - Christ's two/threefold offices (prophet, priest, king) emphasized for the economy of redemption and church ministry.
- **Communicatio idiomatum**
 - Used to safeguard orthodox Christology and the efficacy of Christ's mediation for sinners and sacraments.
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Distinction preserved but integrated into covenantal preaching and pastoral practice.
- **Confessionalism**
 - Appeals to creeds and confessions as formative for teaching and ecclesial identity.
- **Election / Predestination**
 - Treated within covenantal and Christocentric framework to avoid determinism or individualistic voluntarism.
- **Revelation: Word and Spirit**
 - Scripture as the normative written Word; Spirit as the effective witness and enabler of appropriation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary Reformed dogmatics and seminary curricula.
 - As a **polemic** against privatized evangelicalism and sacramental minimalism.
 - As an **exegetical/covenantal model** for preaching, sacramental theology, and ecclesiology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical dialogues where Reformed theology seeks catholic credibility.
