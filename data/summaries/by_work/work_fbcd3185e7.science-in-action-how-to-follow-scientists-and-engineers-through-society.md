### TITLE
Science In Action: How to Follow Scientists and Engineers Through Society - Bruno Latour

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th century STS (science and technology studies) project, rooted in laboratory ethnography and the emergence of actor-network theory (ANT).
 - Reaction against internalist histories of science and philosophical accounts that treat scientific knowledge as a finished product (e.g., Popperian falsificationism, Whiggish histories).
 - Methodological turn toward ethnography, sociology, and the study of practice.

- **Central thesis**
 - Scientific facts and technologies are not simply discovered or revealed; they are the outcomes of collective, situated practices of negotiation, inscription, translation, and network-building. To understand science, one must "follow the actors" while they work, showing how facts become stabilized and black-boxed.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Opens with a methodological manifesto: follow scientists and engineers in their work rather than starting from finished texts or canonical truths.
 - Maps the career of a scientific fact or technical artifact as a sequence of operations:
 - Problematization and mobilization of resources.
 - Enrollment and translation of allies (human and non-human).
 - Use of inscription devices and rhetorical strategies to produce stable representations.
 - Stabilization and black-boxing of successful networks; continued contestation in controversies.
 - Emphasis on practical devices (instruments, graphs, papers) that convert local procedures into reusable, transportable "immutable mobiles."

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages social scientists and philosophers: Robert Merton (norms), Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn (paradigms), David Bloor, Harry Collins, and contemporaries in ANT (Callon, Law).
 - Draws on lab ethnographies (incl. Laboratory Life tradition) and case studies of engineering and scientific controversies.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Not a theological treatise; nonetheless implicates theological categories:
 - Epistemology of revelation vs. constructed knowledge.
 - Authority and credibility (analogous to doctrinal authority).
 - Truth claims, communal validation, and institutional legitimation (resonant with ecclesiology and confessional authority).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Science in Action reframes "truth" as the effect of networks of practices and inscriptions; theology seeking robust accounts of revelation and authority must reckon with how communities, material media, and non-human agents co-produce what counts as true.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological injunction to *follow the actors* rather than starting from texts or final truths.
 - Equal analytic status for human and non-human participants (actants), foregrounding material agency.
 - Practical focus on inscription devices and the mobility of representations.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects purely internalist philosophical norms (e.g., Popper) and teleological historiography (Whig history).
 - Opposes reduction to mere social determinism by carefully describing the heterogeneous processes that produce stability - not explaining away facts, but showing their construction.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Consolidates ANT vocabulary in accessible form: translation, enrollment, black-boxing, immutable mobiles, actants/actors, inscription devices.
 - Moves STS from descriptive sociology to a meta-method for studying knowledge production.

- **Reception and influence in theology**
 - Indirect but significant: adopted by theologians and ethicists interested in material theology, ecological theology, and science-and-religion dialogue.
 - Provoked theological reassessments of revelation, authority, and the role of material culture in religious knowledge.
 - Limited uptake in conservative Reformed circles where propositional and confessional authority remain primary, but valuable for constructive and contextual theologies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a methodological toolkit for studying institutional formation of belief and truth.
 - Useful corrective to theological accounts that treat doctrinal formation as purely intellectual or spiritual by illuminating material and social dimensions.
 - Pedagogically rich for seminars on science and religion, social ontology, and practical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Follow the actors**
 - Methodological maxim: trace practices and networks rather than presupposing outcomes.

- **Actor / Actant**
 - Entities (human or non-human) that make a difference in a network; material objects can be agents.

- **Actor-Network (ANT)**
 - Assemblage of heterogeneous elements that together produce and stabilize a fact, a technology, or an institution.

- **Translation**
 - The process through which actors redefine interests and enroll others to build a shared project.

- **Enrollment**
 - Tactical alignment of allies and resources necessary to sustain a claim.

- **Inscription device**
 - Tools, instruments, graphs, texts that convert practice into durable representations (e.g., lab notebooks, charts).

- **Immutable mobile**
 - Representations that are stable, transportable, and legible across contexts (maps, papers, data tables).

- **Black-boxing**
 - When a network's complexity is hidden because a technology or fact has become stabilized and taken for granted.

- **Controversy**
 - The analytic locus where actors and translations are visible; opening controversies reveals processes of construction.

- **Fact construction / stabilization**
 - Sequence through which provisional claims acquire legitimacy and durability.

- **Material-semiotic**
 - Emphasis on interplay between material practices and symbolic representations.

- **Symmetry principle (methodological)**
 - Treat successful and failed claims with the same analytical tools; explain both by social processes rather than truth-value alone.

- **Immutable mobile vs. fluid local practice**
 - Tension between local situated action and the need for universalizable inscriptions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as scientific knowledge: not a revelation but an achievement of networks.
- As a **polemic** against naïve realism and philosophical accounts that ignore practice and materiality.
- As an **exegetical model** to read scientific texts, technologies, and controversies in theological and ecclesial studies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for rethinking authority, revelation, and institutional formation in theology by foregrounding material and communal processes.
