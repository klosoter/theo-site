### TITLE
F.C. Copleston, Aquinas (secondary) - Focus: **Analogia entis** vs **Analogia fidei**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century Catholic philosophical theology: Copleston (Jesuit historian-philosopher) presents a synthetic, scholarly account of Thomas Aquinas for contemporary readers reacting to modern critiques of natural theology.
 - Milieu includes renewed interest in Thomism, plus strong Protestant critiques (notably Barthian) of natural theology and analogical predication.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Clarify and defend Aquinas's doctrine of analogy: how language about God can be true without collapsing God into creatures (univocity) or reducing theology to only revelation (analogia fidei).
 - Problem: Can human predicates meaningfully apply to God? If so, on what metaphysical and epistemic basis?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Aquinas's metaphysical resources: act/essence (esse), participation, causal relation between Creator and creature.
 - Distinguishes kinds of analogy Aquinas uses:
 - **Analogy of attribution** (terms sensible of creatures applied to God by reference to creatures' relation to God).
 - **Analogy of proportion** (terms signify a proportional relation between creaturely perfections and divine perfections).
 - Shows that analogical predication is grounded in **real relations** (causality, participation) rather than mere linguistic convention.
 - Argues that Aquinas allows natural knowledge of God (via negativa and via affirmativa from effects) while maintaining primacy of revelation for salvific knowledge.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, Scriptum super Sententiis, De ente et essentia).
 - Historical interlocutors: Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, Anselm, Duns Scotus (univocity critique).
 - Modern critics and interlocutors: Karl Barth and other proponents of analogia fidei as corrective to natural theology; twentieth‑century Thomists and analytic philosophers engaging metaphysics of being.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation vs natural theology; epistemology of divine names; divine attributes (simplicity, immutability, omnipotence); Trinity (analogical language about persons); apophaticism; metaphysics of participation and causality.

- **Closing line**
 - Copleston presents Aquinas's analogical theology as a disciplined middle way: analogia entis secures genuine, metaphysically grounded predication of God while remaining critically subordinate to revelation for salvific truth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong stress on Aquinas's metaphysical grounding (esse as act) as the key to understanding analogy - not merely linguistic or epistemic sleight of hand.
 - Emphasizes **causal ordering**: predicates of creatures refer to God because creatures receive being from the divine cause.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters readings that reduce Aquinas to either univocity (Scotus) or to a purely rhetorical analogia fidei (Barth). Shows Aquinas avoids both extremes.
 - Rehabilitates natural theology against radical critiques by showing its proper limits and methods in Thomistic thought.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and systematizes Aquinas's separation of attribution vs proportion in contemporary philosophical vocabulary, aiding analytic engagement.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among Catholic Thomists and ecumenical scholars seeking a robust account of theological language.
 - Used as a primary corrective in debates with Reformed or Barthian theologians; helpful in later 20th‑century recoveries of natural theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, philosophically informed map of how metaphysics, epistemology, and revealed theology interact in Aquinas - valuable for doctrine, apologetics, and ecumenical dialogue.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Analogia entis** - the analogical relation of being: creatures participate in God's being; predication is real, not merely equivocal or univocal.
- **Analogia fidei** - analogy of faith: doctrinal coherence within revelation; often invoked as corrective to speculative natural theology.
 - Contrast: Copleston shows Aquinas integrates both - natural analogy grounded in being, revelation orders and corrects it.
- **Analogy of attribution** - predicates applied to God by reference to effects (e.g., "wise" of God because God is cause of wise creatures).
- **Analogy of proportion** - predicates applied insofar as there is an intelligible proportion between creaturely and divine perfections.
- **Univocity / Equivocity** - position that a term means the same (univocal) or entirely different (equivocal) when applied to God and creatures; Aquinas rejects univocity and equivocity in favor of analogy.
- **Participation** - creatures have being by participation from the divine source; central metaphysical premise for analogical predication.
- **Esse (act of being)** - Aquinas's key metaphysical category; Copleston stresses esse as the locus for predication about God.
- **Causal knowledge / via naturalis** - knowledge of God from effects; legitimate but limited and subordinate to revelation.
- **Via negativa (apophaticism)** - negative theology affirmed by Aquinas; we deny finitudes to guard divine transcendence.
- **Divine simplicity** - God's unity of essence and existence; grounds distinctness of analogical language.
- **Divine attributes** - how perfections (wisdom, power) are predicated analogically.
- **Revelation** - authoritative corrective and completion of natural theology; salvific knowledge transcends natural analogy.
- **Metaphysical realism** - commitment to real relations (not mere conceptual parallels) that make analogy possible.
- **Scotus vs Aquinas** - Scotist univocity contrasted with Thomistic analogy; Copleston clarifies the difference.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Thomistic analogical predication and its metaphysical grounding.
 - As a **polemic resource** in debates with Barthian and radical Protestant critiques of natural theology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Aquinas on divine attributes, Trinity, and the interface of reason and revelation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking medieval metaphysics (esse, participation) to modern analytic discussions of theological language.
