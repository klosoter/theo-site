### TITLE
The Doctrine of God in Reformed Theology (lectures and essays) - Peter A. Lillback

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary conservative Reformed milieu (late 20th-early 21st century). Lectures and essays given in seminary and academy contexts, drawing on classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Reformed confessions, Puritans, scholastics) to respond to modern theological trends (process theology, open theism, liberal immanentism).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend a classical Reformed doctrine of God that maintains the primacy of God's ontological perfections (the "absolute" attributes) while accounting theologically and pastorally for God's relational engagement with creatures (the "relative" attributes), without collapsing transcendence into creaturely immanence or reducing relational scriptural language to mere analogy.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes methodological commitments: Scripture as norm, creedal and confessional history as interpretive lens, and philosophical rigor (classical theism) as necessary to avoid category mistakes.
 - Clarifies categories: defines and distinguishes *absolute* (incommunicable/ontological) attributes and *relative* (relational/creature-directed) attributes, tracing both to divine simplicity and covenantal faithfulness.
 - Defends the coherence of classical attributes (aseity, simplicity, immutability, eternity) against charges from process/open theism that such attributes preclude genuine relationality.
 - Shows how covenant theology and Trinitarian relations mediate God's constancy with genuine responsiveness to creatures - preserving both God's unchanging nature and real action in history.
 - Applies doctrinal conclusions to pastoral and apologetic concerns (prayer, providence, suffering, divine promises).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** John Calvin, Augustine, Reformed scholastics (e.g., Francis Turretin), Westminster divines, Puritans, contemporary critics such as process theologians, open theists, and sometimes Karl Barth (for contrast on divine freedom and revelation).
- **Doctrines treated:** Attributes of God (absolute vs relative), Trinity (intra-Trinitarian relations as model), revelation and Scripture, covenant (as framework for relational attributes), providence, prayer, and pastoral implications of divine immutability and compassion.
- **Closing line:** Reformed classical theism, rightly nuanced by covenantal and Trinitarian thought, secures both God's transcendent perfection and authentic relational engagement with his covenant people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **priority of being over action**: God's attributes are rooted in who God is, not simply what God does; relational language is grounded in ontological realities.
 - Uses covenant theology as the bridge between absolute perfections and God's relational speech/acts toward creatures.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects perceived imbalances in modern relational theologies (open theism/process) that valorize change and contingency at the expense of divine sovereignty and immutability.
 - Pushes back on some pietistic or existential readings that make God's faithfulness a function of temporal response rather than rooted in eternal triune being.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes "relative attributes" with careful attention to their grounding: not attributes of a lesser, changing deity, but relational manifestations consequent upon immutable divine nature and covenantal commitment.
 - Clarifies overlap and distinctions between the communicable/incommunicable divide and the absolute/relative distinction.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative Reformed seminaries for teaching the doctrine of God; influential among pastors and students seeking a robust classical theistic account compatible with covenant theology.
 - Limited engagement in liberal or process-oriented circles; primarily polemical utility against open theism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides clear pedagogical categories for teaching attributes; supplies pastoral applications (prayer, suffering) anchored in doctrinal stability; serves as a concise corrective to trends that undercut divine aseity and immutability.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes:** Those aspects of God considered in himself (aseity, simplicity, immutability, eternity); fundamental and non-relational.
- **Relative attributes:** Attributes described primarily in relation to creatures (love, mercy, wrath, faithfulness); not arbitrary changes but relational expressions of the absolute attributes.
 - Subtlety: relative does not mean secondary or ontologically dependent in a demeaning sense; they are manifestations of the one divine nature.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence and independence; foundation for arguments against creaturely contingency determining God.
- **Divine simplicity:** Denial of composition in God; supports coherence between God's being and his attributes.
- **Immutability:** God's unchangeableness in essence and promises; reconciled with responsive action through covenantal and Trinitarian categories.
- **Eternity (timelessness vs. durational):** Traditional classical theism emphasized atemporal eternity; Lillback defends that view while noting pastoral and exegetical nuances.
- **Omniscience/Omnipotence/Omnipresence:** Treated as classical perfections that ground providence and trust, not deterrents to genuine relationship.
- **Communicable vs incommunicable attributes:** Cross-referenced with absolute/relative distinctions to clarify which perfections humans may reflect.
- **Covenantal attributes:** Faithfulness, fidelity, promise-keeping as covenantal outworking of eternal divine faithfulness.
- **Trinitarian relations:** Intra-divine relations used as an analogue for legitimately speaking of relationality without compromise of simplicity.
- **Revelation and Scripture:** Normative witness of God's attributes; primary corrective to speculative theologies.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for absolute vs relative attribute categories in curricular settings.
 - As a **polemic resource** against open theism and process theologies that undercut divine immutability.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for applying attribute theology to prayer, providence, suffering, and preaching.
