### TITLE
Providence and Prayer: How Does God Work in the World? - Terrance L. Tiessen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical/analytic-theological milieu (1990s). Written amid renewed debate over divine sovereignty, human freedom, and the efficacy of prayer - responding to deterministic readings of Reformed scholasticism, the rise of open theism, and renewed interest in Molinism and Thomistic concurrence.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can God be truly sovereign and providential while human beings exercise genuine freedom, and how can petitionary prayer be real and effective within that providence?
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnose polar positions: (1) meticulous determinism (God controls every event so prayer is causally redundant), (2) radical openness/process views (God risks outcomes and lacks exhaustive foreknowledge), (3) Molinist attempts (middle knowledge) and compatibilist responses.
 - Propose a middle third way often described as a **governing providence**: God ordains the world at the level of purposes, laws, and governance while allowing genuine creaturely causal agency within the ordained structure.
 - Articulate a theological account of prayer: prayer participates in God's governance; God's dispositions, promises, and covenantal intentions shape how he responds to petitions without abdicating sovereignty or collapsing creaturely freedom.
 - Technical treatment of divine action: analysis of concurrence, secondary causation, foreknowledge, and divine decree language; assessment of biblical texts on prayer and providence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Aquinas, Molina, classical Reformed writers (Calvin, Turretin), modern theologians and philosophers (representatives of open theism and process thought), and biblical exegesis across Old and New Testaments.
- **Doctrines treated:** Providence, sovereignty, foreknowledge, divine decree, concurrence and secondary causation, human freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist models), prayer (petitionary efficacy, intercession), covenant theology implications.
- **Closing line:** Tiessen's theological center of gravity: God governs the world in a way that secures his sovereign purposes while preserving genuine human freedom and making petitionary prayer an authentic means by which God brings about divinely willed ends.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasizes **governance** rather than micromanagement - God orders structures, laws, dispositions, and covenantal promises that shape but do not determine every free act.
 - Treats petitionary prayer as embedded within divine governance: prayer is neither illusion nor autonomous cause but a real interaction God has ordained to fulfill his purposes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against both "meticulous providence" that nullifies prayer and "risk-taking" open-theist models that compromise divine sovereignty.
 - Critiques Molinism where it appears to privatize providence into a system of counterfactuals; seeks a synthesis that retains biblical causality and relational responsiveness without surrendering doctrinal coherence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Stresses the language of **governing dispositions** and **ordered contingency** asive terms to navigate between determinism and indeterminism.
 - Reframes prayer's efficacy as part of God's ordained economy of means rather than as an exception to providential control.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Adopted in evangelical and Reformed circles as a careful resource to defend both prayer's meaningfulness and divine sovereignty.
 - Used by pastoral theologians and philosophers of religion as a measured alternative to both hard determinism and open theism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a balanced, biblically attentive, philosophically informed treatment of a perennial problem.
 - Useful in classroom settings to map options and to teach careful distinctions about divine action, human freedom, and the role of prayer.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Providence:** God's ongoing, purposeful governance of creation; central category Tiessen reshapes as structured governance rather than micromanagement.
- **Governing providence / ordered contingency:** God's ordering of laws, dispositions, and covenantal frameworks within which creaturely freedom operates.
- **Concurrence:** The doctrine that God cooperates with secondary causes; Tiessen defends a non-reductive concurrence that preserves creaturely causation.
- **Secondary causation:** Creatures genuinely cause events; God sustains and governs without eliminating secondary causal efficacy.
- **Foreknowledge vs. decree:** Differentiates God's foreknowledge and eternal decrees from deterministic predestination that precludes meaningful petition.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism):** Engaged critically - Tiessen interacts with Molinist resources but resists reducing providence to counterfactuals about free choices.
- **Open theism:** Identified and critiqued where it undercuts divine sovereignty; Tiessen seeks alternatives that retain relational responsiveness without denying exhaustive providential control.
- **Petitionary prayer / efficacy of prayer:** Prayer is presented as a divinely ordained means by which God effects his purposes, not as causal rival to God nor as impotent ritual.
- **Covenantal promises and dispositions:** Key biblical categories explaining how God wills to respond to prayer within his promises.
- **Risk-taking God (rejected):** Tiessen counters portrayals that God lacks full knowledge or control as unacceptable theologically.
- **Ordered means:** Theological term for ways God commonly acts in the world (including prayer), preserving regularity and responsiveness.
- **Freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist):** Tiessen affirms genuine freedom in a compatibilist-friendly framework of ordered contingency.
- **Divine action (biblical-conceptual synthesis):** Uses Scripture and philosophical analysis to account for both miracle and ordinary providence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition/source** for a middle, governance-focused doctrine of providence in systematic theology.
- As a **polemic** resource against both meticulous determinism and open-theist portrayals of God.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting biblical texts on prayer and divine response, informing pastoral theology and spiritual practice.
