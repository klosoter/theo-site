### TITLE
The Threefold Office of Christ (sermons and essays) - Hugh Martin

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid‑ to late‑19th century Free Church of Scotland sermon/essay milieu. Combines Victorian pulpit practice with Reformed confessional theology; addressed to ministers and lay congregations concerned with Christocentric piety and pastoral formation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The person and work of Christ must be understood as a unified, threefold office - **Prophet**, **Priest**, and **King** - such that each office illumines distinct aspects of revelation, redemption, and rule in the covenant of grace.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical opening: Scriptural warrant for the three offices (Hebrews, Psalms, prophetic and Gospel texts).
 - Christ as Prophet: revelation of the Father, authoritative teaching, fulfilment of typology.
 - Christ as Priest: atoning sacrifice, mediation, heavenly intercession, typology from Leviticus/Tabernacle.
 - Christ as King: royal rule, covenant headship, eschatological supremacy and present government over the church.
 - Synthesis: unity of the offices in the one Person of the Son and pastoral implications for faith, worship, and Christian obedience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on the Reformed tradition broadly (Calvin and the Westminster formulary), engages medieval and patristic analogies of munus triplex, and responds implicitly to 19th‑century reductions of Christology that fragment his work (e.g., pietistic or purely moral‑exemplar emphases).
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology, soteriology/atonement, mediation and intercession, revelation and prophecy, covenant theology, ecclesiology (office and governance), and eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The incarnate Son executes one salvific mission in three complementary offices: to reveal the Father, to expiate and intercede, and to rule as covenant King - each office necessary for a holistic gospel and pastoral life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong pastoral application: offices are not merely academic categories but shape worship, assurance, and pastoral care.
 - Stress on the continuity of offices - Martin resists compartmentalizing Christ's roles and insists on their necessary unity in personal union.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects over‑systematizing scholastic tendencies that treat offices as discrete functions; counters liberal or moralistic Christologies that reduce Christ to teacher or exemplar only.
 - Reclaims patristic and Reformed resources against modern fragmentation of soteriology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rearticulates classical munus triplex in sermonic language accessible to congregations, bridging academic theology and lay devotion.
 - Emphasizes the office‑language as a pastoral hermeneutic for reading Scripture and ordering the church.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and Presbyterian preaching and pastoral instruction in the Anglophone world; cited as a reliable pastoral account of the threefold office.
 - Influenced homiletical treatments and catechetical instruction that aim to integrate doctrine and devotion.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model for combining exegesis, systematic coherence, and pastoral application.
 - Valuable corrective to both reductionist and overly abstract treatments of Christ's work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus triplex:** Latin label for the threefold office (Prophet, Priest, King); central organizing concept.
- **Prophet (office):** Christ as revealer of God - teaching, fulfilling law/prophecy, authoritative interpretation of Scripture and covenant.
- **Priest (office):** Christ as mediator and atoning sacrifice - typology (sacrifice, altar), expiation, continuous heavenly intercession.
- **King (office):** Christ as covenant ruler - sovereignty, governance of church and conscience, eschatological lordship.
- **Personal union:** The theological principle that one Person (the Son) unites the three offices without division - guards against Nestorianism or functional separations.
- **Mediation (mediator):** The active role of Christ bridging God and humanity; encompasses priestly and prophetic functions.
- **Covenant head / federal representation:** Christ as representative of his people in all three offices - legal standing, sacrificial substitution, and rule.
- **Typology:** Use of OT priests, prophets, and kings as foreshadowing the Son's offices; Martin emphasizes pastoral typological reading.
- **Atonement language:** Penal/substitutional emphases combined with covenantal and intercessory motifs; not a single formula but integrated across offices.
- **Eschatological rule:** The kingly office unfolds present rule and consummated sovereignty in the future.
- **Worshipal implications:** Offices shape liturgy, preaching, sacraments, and assurance.
- **Pastoral hermeneutic:** Reading doctrines as directly formative for Christian life and ministry.
- **Authority and submission:** Balances divine authority (Christ's kingship and prophetic word) with pastoral submission and sanctification.
- **Intercession (perpetual):** Ongoing priestly ministry of Christ in heaven securing application of redemption.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for munus triplex in Reformed dogmatics and homiletics.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist Christologies (moral‑exemplarism, privatized piety).
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for preaching Christ's offices together in catechesis and pastoral care.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in integrating covenant, soteriology, and ecclesial practice.
