### TITLE
**Technology and the Future of Creation** - Egbert Schuurman (Reformational philosophical theology addressing ethics and destiny of technological development)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century response to rapid technological expansion, ecological crisis, and debates in philosophy of technology.
 - Rooted in Dutch Reformational philosophy (H. Dooyeweerd, A. Kuyper) and Reformed theological concerns about creation, stewardship, and modernity.
 - Aimed at theologians, technologists, and public intellectuals concerned with normative assessment of technology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Modern technology is not morally neutral: it embodies a distinct rationality that reshapes human beings and the created order. Christian theology must supply normative creational standards to evaluate and guide technological development toward responsible stewardship and the flourishing of creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Analytic diagnosis
 - Technology has acquired autonomy within modern culture; technological rationality tends to instrumentalize nature and human life.
 - The claim of technical neutrality is a myth; choices embedded in design, practice, and institutionalization carry moral and theological significance.
 - Normative theological resources
 - The doctrine of creation (Creator-creature distinction, created norms) provides objective standards for judging technological ends and means.
 - Human dominion must be reframed as stewardship accountable to God and creational norms, not as unbounded mastery.
 - Constructive proposals
 - Develop a reformational philosophy of technology that retrieves creational norms, integrates interdisciplinary assessment, and shapes education, policy, and technical practice.
 - Institutional and cultural reforms (education, professional ethics, public policy) to reorient technological trajectories toward sustainability, human dignity, and the good order of creation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformational philosophers: Herman Dooyeweerd, D. H. Th. Vollenhoven.
 - Critics and analysts of technology: Jacques Ellul (shared concerns about autonomy of technique), Martin Heidegger (analysis of enframing), contrasted on diagnosis and remedy.
 - Contemporary ethicists, theologians, and ecological thinkers; draws on Reformed confessional categories.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (central): norms, teleology, integrity of created orders.
 - **Anthropology**: human vocation, stewardship vs. domination.
 - **Providence and eschatology**: limits to technological salvationism; hope tempered by dependence on God.
 - **Ethics**: public, professional, and ecological ethics derived from creational norms.
 - **Revelation and general revelation**: role of natural law/creation as a source for normative judgment about technology.

- **Closing line**
 - Schuurman's theological center of gravity: technology must be judged and shaped by the Creator-rooted norms of the created order so that human dominion becomes accountable stewardship that preserves the integrity and future of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Reformational normative grounding**
 - Uses Kuyperian/Dooyeweerdian creational norms (modal structure, Creator-creature distinction) rather than mere consequentialist or instrumental criteria.
- **Balance of critique and constructive program**
 - Unlike Ellul's primarily negative diagnosis, Schuurman pairs critique with institutional, educational, and policy proposals for reformation of technology.
- **Holistic integration of theology and philosophy of technology**
 - Treats technological rationality as cultural and philosophical, not merely technical or economic.
- **Emphasis on non-neutrality of technology**
 - Argues that design choices embody moral visions and effectively form human beings and social practices.
- **Correction to secular technocracy and techno-optimism**
 - Challenges both libertarian mastery narratives and naïve progress narratives by insisting on theologically informed limits and goals.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within Reformed and Kuyperian circles; important resource for Christian ethics of technology, ecological theology, and public theology.
 - Increasingly cited in interdisciplinary technology assessment, faith-and-science dialogues, and Christian higher-education curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable framework for assessing emerging technologies (biotech, AI, ecological engineering) with theological clarity and policy relevance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technological rationality** - The specific logic and modes of thought that prioritize efficiency, control, and predictability; shapes ends as well as means.
- **Autonomy of technology** - The process by which technical systems and norms become self-validating and socially dominant.
- **Instrumentalization** - Treating nature and persons as mere means to technological ends; central ethical concern.
- **Creational norms** - God-ordained structures and ends within creation that serve as objective criteria for moral and technological judgment.
- **Stewardship (reframed dominion)** - Responsible caretaking ordered by creational norms, contrasted with unrestricted domination.
- **Reformational philosophy** - A philosophical approach (Dooyeweerdian) that grounds normative critique in the Creator-creature distinction and modal aspects of reality.
- **Techno-idolatry / technicism** - The sacralization of technology as ultimate solution or meaning-provider.
- **Design ethics / value-laden artifacts** - The claim that artifacts embody values; design decisions are normative acts.
- **Institutional reform** - Educational, professional, and policy measures to align technological practice with theological norms.
- **Technology assessment (theologically informed)** - Interdisciplinary evaluation of technologies using creational norms and public ethical criteria.
- **Human flourishing** - A telos for technology centered on the dignity and vocation of persons within creation.
- **Sustainability / future of creation** - Long-term integrity of ecosystems and created orders as a criterion for technological success.
- **Common grace and general revelation** - Resources for shared public reasoning about technology, though subordinate to special revelation for doctrinal matters.

- How this work is used across loci
 - **Definition source / conceptual pivot**: to define "technology" as culturally embedded rationality rather than mere tools.
 - **Polemic**: to critique techno-optimism, neutrality claims, and secular technocracy from a Christian-normative standpoint.
 - **Ethics & public theology model**: as a constructive template for institutionally reorienting education, policy, and professional ethics toward creation-centered ends.
