### TITLE
**On Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism (1525)** - Huldrych Zwingli

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written 1525 in Zurich amid early Reformation controversies. Zwingli responding to rising Anabaptist challenges and Catholic sacramental claims; part of the Swiss Reformation's effort to define civic-ecclesial order.
 - Site usage: 1 reference focusing on **Baptism Mode; Infant vs Believers; Efficacy**.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Baptism is a covenantal **sign and pledge** (not a magical regenerating sacrament); infant baptism is biblically warranted and rebaptism is unnecessary and schismatic.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical evidence (household baptisms, covenantal parallels) establishing continuity between circumcision and baptism.
 - Refutation of Anabaptist insistence on believer-only baptism and rebaptism:
 - Argues prior infant baptism is valid if performed with right intention and in the Christian community.
 - Rebaptism undermines church order, familial covenant, and scriptural precedent.
 - Practical consequences: baptism admits to covenant community and privileges (e.g., Lord's Supper) but does not automatically impart saving grace apart from faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary opponents: Anabaptist leaders (e.g., Conrad Grebel, Felix Manz) and their insistence on adult-only confessional baptism.
 - Comparisons/contrasts with Roman Catholic sacramental theology and with Luther on aspects of sacramental efficacy.
 - Uses Scripture (household accounts in Acts, Pauline language), patristic and scholastic concepts selectively; frames argument in civic-pastoral terms.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (baptism as covenant sign), ecclesiology (membership, discipline), sacramentology (nature and effect of sacraments), soteriology (relation of sign to faith and regeneration).
- **Closing line**
 - Zwingli centers baptism as the covenantal sign and church rite that admits persons (including infants) to the community; its efficacy is relational and promissory, not intrinsically regenerative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong covenantal logic: baptism stands in direct typological continuity with circumcision; family membership matters for covenant inclusion.
 - Civic-ecclesial perspective: baptism has social and communal consequences for order in the Christian polity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Anabaptists: rejects rebaptism and the exclusive claim of believer-only baptism; treats their insistence as disruptive to gospel-ordered society.
 - Against Catholicism: denies automatic sacramental regeneration; opposes view of baptism as inherent instrument of saving grace independent of faith.
 - Compared to Luther: closer to Zwinglian symbolic/pledge account than Luther's stronger assertion of sacramental efficacy, though both affirm infant baptism.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Deployment of **sign/pledge** language (signum / pignus) to mark baptisms as covenantal tokens rather than ontological conferrals.
 - Early formulation of a Reformed sacramental economy that separates sign from the inward work of the Spirit.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative text for Swiss Reformed paedobaptism; provided polemical ammunition against Anabaptists.
 - Influenced later Reformed writers (Calvinian sacramental refinement builds on and modifies Zwingli).
 - Also contributed to state-church policies that led to suppression of Anabaptists in Swiss cantons.
- **Enduring value**
 - Illustrative model of covenantal paedobaptist apologetics; valuable for studies in sacramental theology, ecclesial order, and Reformation pastoral ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism** - the Christian rite as covenant sign; marks admission to the church community.
- **Infant baptism (paedobaptism)** - defended as biblically and covenantally legitimate; parallels circumcision; secures covenant promises to households.
- **Believer's baptism** - Anabaptist position criticized for ignoring household precedent and communal covenant.
- **Rebaptism** - condemned as unnecessary, schismatic, and disruptive when applied to those baptized in infancy within the church.
- **Sign and pledge (signum / pignus)** - central Zwinglian idiom: baptism is a visible token and pledge of God's promises, not an automatic instrument of regeneration.
- **Baptismal regeneration** - rejected in the sense of automatic, ex opere operato impartation of grace; regeneration is linked to faith and Spirit, not merely rite.
- **Covenant** - organizing principle: baptism as continuation of covenantal practices (circumcision) binding family and community.
- **Household baptisms** - Acts' narratives used to justify infant baptism and communal application of the sign.
- **Mode (immersion / affusion / sprinkling)** - Zwingli emphasizes meaning over strict mode; affusion/sprinkling considered acceptable; mode is adiaphora relative to covenantal sign.
- **Ecclesial membership** - baptism as admission to rights/duties in the visible church (e.g., Lord's Supper, discipline).
- **Sacrament / sacramental economy** - sacraments are signs appointed by Christ; efficacy depends on covenant promise and Spirit, not mechanical effect.
- **Faith and promise** - baptism points to gospel promise which requires personal appropriation by faith for salvific effect.
- **Discipline and order** - rebaptism threatens ecclesial order; Zwingli ties sacramental practice to civic stability.
- **Typology (circumcision-baptism)** - interpretive key linking Old Testament covenant sign with New Testament sacrament.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed paedobaptist theology and covenantal framing of baptism.
- As a **polemic** against Anabaptist rebaptism and against sacramental regeneration claims.
- As an **exegetical model** for arguing from household baptisms and typology (circumcision => baptism).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in early Reformed sacramental thought distinguishing sign from inward efficacy.
