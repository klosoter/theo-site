### TITLE
Select Sermons and Addresses on Church Government - James Bannerman (mid-19th century, Free Church of Scotland context)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-19th century Scotland, in the aftermath of the Disruption of 1843 and formation of the Free Church. Bannerman writes as a Reformed pastor-theologian defending Presbyterian order amid disputes over patronage, civil interference, and the voluntary principle.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The church's government is a divine institution grounded in Scripture and covenant, properly expressed in Presbyterian parity, representative courts, and discipline; it must be defended against Erastian control, voluntary individualism, and prelatic hierarchy.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Affirmation that church government is normative Christian doctrine, not a mere adiaphoron.
 - Scriptural exegesis supporting the eldership (presbyters), plurality of office-bearers, and representative courts (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly).
 - Historical-theological proof: continuity from apostolic practice through the Reformation and Scottish tradition (Knox, Calvin).
 - Practical articulation: how offices operate, how discipline is to be exercised, and why connectionalism secures order and purity.
 - Polemical rebuttals of Erastianism (state supremacy in ecclesiastical matters), voluntarism (church as voluntary association), and prelacy (episcopal supremacy).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary: Scripture and the Westminster Standards/Scottish confessional materials.
 - Historical: Calvin, John Knox, Rutherford and other Presbyterian fathers.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Erastian theorists, advocates of the voluntary principle, civil courts and patrons implicated in the Disruption, and Anglican/episcopal apologists.
- **Doctrines treated:** Ecclesiology (nature, marks, and offices of the church), covenant theology (ground of church membership and discipline), authority (Scripture and church courts), ministry (ordination, parity of elders), sacraments and pastoral discipline as means of grace.
- **Closing line:** Bannerman's theological center of gravity insists that authentic church government is a scriptural, covenantal, and communally representative ordering that preserves the church's spiritual independence and fidelity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong synthesis of pastoral sermon-style exposition with rigorous constitutional argumentation; polity is both theological and pastoral.
 - Emphasis on the *representative* principle: courts act as members of a covenant body, not simply delegated managerial agents.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects Erastian reduction of the church to a civil function and rebuts voluntaryists who reduce the church to a mere association.
 - Distinguishes Presbyterian parity from both episcopal hierarchy and congregational isolation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies language of "spiritual independence" and frames courts as organic expressions of covenant community rather than purely bureaucratic mechanisms.
 - Tightens the link between covenant theology and practical disciplines (membership, censure, restoration).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in the Free Church and later Presbyterian circles as a robust apologetic for denominational order.
 - Cited in debates over patronage, church-state relations, and disciplinary practice in 19th-century British Presbyterianism.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a model for integrating confessional theology with pastoral polity; useful for teaching ecclesiology, defending church autonomy, and shaping Presbyterian practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presbyterian polity:** Government by eldership in a graded system of courts (session, presbytery, synod, general assembly).
- **Eldership / presbyters:** Plural ministry of teaching and ruling; parity of ministers and ruling elders emphasized.
- **Session (Kirk-Session):** Local court for pastoral oversight, worship, and discipline.
- **Presbytery:** Regional court exercising oversight, ordination, and mutual accountability.
- **General Assembly / Synod:** Higher representative courts for common governance and doctrine.
- **Spiritual independence:** The church's autonomy in spiritual matters from civil jurisdiction.
- **Erastianism:** Theory asserting civil supremacy over ecclesiastical affairs; Bannerman's primary polemical target.
- **Voluntaryism:** The view of the church as merely a voluntary association; critiqued for undermining covenantal membership and discipline.
- **Patronage:** Civil right to nominate ministers; used as a focal issue in debates leading to the Disruption.
- **Discipline / censure:** Means of preserving purity and effecting restoration within covenant community.
- **Covenant theology (applied):** Grounds membership and the church's corporate responsibilities.
- **Representative principle:** The conceptual underpinning of Presbyterian courts as representatives of covenant community rather than ad hoc committees.
- **Sacraments as communal means of grace:** Emphasizes administration under office-bearers and courts.
- **Authority (Scripture & standards):** Scripture as normative with Westminster Confession as interpretive framework.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for classic Presbyterian polity and the theological justification of courts and eldership.
- As a **polemic** resource against Erastian and voluntaryist positions in church-state debates.
- As an **exegetical and practical model** for deploying covenant theology in matters of membership, discipline, and pastoral oversight.
