### TITLE
Contributions to The Westminster Theological Journal on Pauline Eschatology - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (focus: Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-to-late 20th century Reformed scholarship, published in The Westminster Theological Journal; addresses ongoing debates between covenantal/Reformed exegesis and popular futurist/dispensational readings.
 - Situated within the broader recovery of "inaugurated eschatology" among evangelical and Reformed scholars.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Paul's teaching about the Antichrist / "man of lawlessness" (2 Thess 2) must be read within an **inaugurated-but-not-yet** eschatological framework: the new age has been inaugurated in Christ, but the final revelation of the lawless one is still eschatologically future, though it has present precursors and is being restrained now.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegetical analysis of 2 Thessalonians 2: terminology (apokalupsis, ho anomos, katechon), syntax, and Pauline theology of eschatology.
 - The "man of lawlessness" is eschatologically decisive - his full manifestation syntagmatically follows the removal of the restrainer and precedes the parousia.
 - The restrainer (katechon) is read functionally rather than narrowly: it coheres with the Spirit-church-Christological reign already present in the world; thus restraint is real and present without denying a future, climactic revelation of evil.
 - Counters dualistic readings that make the eschatological age wholly future or wholly present; insists on continuity of God's reign inaugurated in Christ and now advancing in history.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Pauline corpus (esp. 1-2 Thessalonians, Pauline apocalyptic motifs), ancient Jewish and early Christian apocalyptic background.
 - Dialogues (implicit or explicit) with dispensational futurism, extremes of full preterism, and some contemporary critical readings that privatize the restrainer or reduce the passage to immediate first-century concerns.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschatology); Christology (present reign of the exalted Christ); pneumatology (Spirit's restraining/constitutive role); hamartiology (lawlessness/anomia); ecclesiology (church's role in the present age); revelation/apocalypse.

- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin's central move: Paul presents the "man of lawlessness" as a future, climactic antagonist whose coming is constrained by the present, real reign of Christ and the Spirit - a posture that preserves both eschatological tension and theological continuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the **canonical-theological** reading of Paul: eschatological statements integrated into Christology and pneumatology rather than treated as isolated apocalyptic curiosities.
 - Emphasizes the **functional identity of the restrainer** (katechon) with the present, Spirit-empowered reign of Christ and the church rather than an exclusively political or impersonal force.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on dispensational futurism that disconnects the church from the restraining power and insists on a late-20th/21st century, exclusively future "Antichrist" actor.
 - Counters full preterist moves that would collapse the prophecy into purely first-century phenomena, preserving a future consummation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines "already-not-yet" language as an exegetical tool for 2 Thessalonians rather than merely a theological slogan; treats katechon as theologically explicable within covenantal/pneumatological categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective to simplistic futurist or preterist interpretations.
 - Influential in teaching Pauline eschatology in seminary curricula; frequently used in debates over the Antichrist and eschatological chronology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful exegetical-theological synthesis: how to read apocalyptic in Pauline theology without fragmenting Christology, pneumatology, and ecclesiology.
 - Remains a go-to resource for teaching the theological coherence of Paul's eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The new age is already inaugurated in Christ but awaits consummation; Gaffin uses this as the hermeneutical key for 2 Thessalonians.
- **Man of lawlessness (ho anomos) / Antichrist**
 - A future, climactic eschatological antagonist whose full revelation follows the removal of restraint; present precursors are possible.
- **Apokalupsis (revelation)**
 - The unveiling of the lawless one is an eschatological apokalupsis, not merely a political coup or symbol.
- **Katechon (the restrainer)**
 - Functionally identified with the Spirit-empowered, present reign of Christ in/through the church (not limited to a single political entity).
- **Parousia**
 - The final coming of Christ; Gaffin reads the sequence: restraint lifted -> revelation of lawlessness -> parousia.
- **Anomia (lawlessness)**
 - More than moral disorder: an eschatological, anti-kingdom principle opposing Christ's lordship.
- **Already-not-yet tension**
 - The methodological lens: keeps present reality and future consummation in theological balance.
- **Pneumatological restraint**
 - The Spirit's role in holding back the full manifestation of evil; aligns restraint with divine sovereign action.
- **Christological continuity**
 - Argues the new age's present power derives from the exalted Christ's kingly rule, against rigid temporal separations.
- **Canonical-theological exegesis**
 - Reading Paul within the unity of Scripture and doctrine, not as isolated apocalyptic fragments.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for interpreting 2 Thessalonians that integrates grammar, context, and theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dispensational/futurist over-specialization of the Antichrist motif.
 - As a **definition source** for theological teaching on katechon, inaugurated eschatology, and the relation of the Spirit/church to eschatological restraint.
