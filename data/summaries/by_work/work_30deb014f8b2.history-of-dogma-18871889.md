### TITLE
History of Dogma (1887-1889) - Albrecht Ritschl

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-century German Protestant theology; emergence of historical-critical methods and ethical-religious theology. Ritschl writes amid post-Kantian epistemology, Schleiermacherian feeling-theology, and reaction to Hegelian metaphysics.
 - Work is part historiography, part methodological manifesto: applying Ritschlian criteria to the genealogy of Christian doctrines.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Dogma is historically formed and serves the religious-ethical life of the faith-community; doctrines must be judged by their practical, soteriological worth rather than by metaphysical speculation.
 - Theology should distinguish between the religious value of a doctrine (its worth for reconciliation with God) and unverifiable metaphysical accretions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of major doctrines across church history with attention to origin, function, and transformation.
 - Major moves:
 - Diagnose metaphysical inflation of early and medieval dogmas (speculative Christology, ontological Trinity).
 - Reconstruct doctrines in terms of their religious-ethical function for the community (e.g., atonement, kingdom, sacraments).
 - Advocate a methodological shift: historical-critical description + normative criterion of religious value.
 - Applies this method to issues including Christology, Trinity, revelation, atonement, sacraments, and eschatology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages patristic and medieval authors (Augustine, Athanasius, Chalcedon framers), Reformers, and moderns (Schleiermacher, Kant, Hegel).
 - Implicit foils: speculative theologians and scholastic theologizing; later critics include Barth and neo-orthodoxy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (as religious encounter/value), Christology (functional interpretation), Trinity (historical development vs. metaphysical formulation), atonement (ethical/representative emphases), sacraments (community-ethical role), justification, and eschatology.
 - Notable attention to **Realized vs Future Eschatology**: Ritschl privileges the ethical-realization of the kingdom in the community (realized eschatology) over speculative apocalyptic futurism.

- **Closing line**
 - A historiographical theology that relocates dogma from metaphysical speculation into the sphere of religious-ethical life: doctrines are meaningful insofar as they function to bring persons into moral reconciliation with God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Dogma as functional and normative for communal moral life; valuation of doctrines by religious effect rather than metaphysical truth-claims.
 - Strong commitment to methodological historicism: doctrines are intelligible only as products of concrete historical needs and debates.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects scholastic metaphysics (ontological proofs, abstract Trinitarian ontology) and Hegelian system-building.
 - Moves beyond Schleiermacherian subjectivism by insisting on communal ethical verification of doctrine rather than private feeling alone.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of a value-centered criterion (religious/ethical "worth") for assessing doctrines.
 - Functional reading of Christology and sacraments: doctrinal content reconstructed from soteriological function.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence on liberal Protestant historiography and on method in dogmatic history; informed later ethical and social readings of Christianity.
 - Criticized sharply by neo-orthodoxy (Barth) for relativizing doctrinal truth to religious experience and for underestimating revelation's propositional content.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for historically conscious theology and for ethical readings of doctrine; useful corrective to ahistorical dogmatism.
 - Provokes sustained debate on the boundary between historical description and theological normativity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Dogma** - historically conditioned formulations that function to shape communal religious life; not simply abstract metaphysics.
- **Historical development** - doctrines must be traced through time to disclose origin, change, and function.
- **Value-judgment (religious worth)** - criterion for assessing doctrines: their efficacy in creating reconciliation with God and moral transformation.
- **Religious-ethical theology** - theology whose norm is the moral and soteriological life of the Christian community.
- **Revelation (as religious encounter)** - revelation understood primarily as experiential and functional, not as metaphysical propositional content.
- **Christology (functional)** - emphasis on Christ's saving activity and ethical significance over speculative ontology of person and nature.
- **Atonement (ethical/representative model)** - tends toward moral influence/representative readings rather than penal substitution metaphysics.
- **Trinity (historical formulation)** - treated as a developed doctrine reflecting pastoral and polemical needs, critiqued when turned into abstract ontology.
- **Sacraments (communal function)** - rites evaluated for their capacity to sustain the ethical-religious life of the church.
- **Justification (ethical-relational)** - focus on reconciliation and ethical standing before God, less on forensic metaphysics.
- **Realized eschatology** - kingdom-present emphasis: eschatological salvation realized in community and ethical life (Ritschlian preference).
- **Future eschatology** - apocalyptic, futurist expectation; described and critiqued when it detaches from present ethical demand.
- **Method: historical-critical + normative** - combine descriptive history with a normative test of religious value.
- **Anti-metaphysical stance** - persistent suspicion of speculative claims that outstrip communal religious benefit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for historicist/functional approaches to doctrine.
 - As a **polemic** against metaphysical and scholastic formulations of theology.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for interpreting doctrines through pastoral and ethical function (especially applied in debates on eschatology: realized vs future).
