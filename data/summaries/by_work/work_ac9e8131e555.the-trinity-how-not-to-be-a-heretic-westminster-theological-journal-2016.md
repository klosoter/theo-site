### TITLE
**The Trinity: How Not to Be a Heretic** - Vern Poythress (Westminster Theological Journal, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theological milieu (2016). Responds to renewed debates in evangelicalism over **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS)** and the relation between the **ontological** and **economic** Trinity; situated against recent popular treatments (e.g., Grudem, Ware) and historical-creedal commitments (Nicene/Chalcedonian language).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend classical Nicene orthodoxy by showing how careless appeals to functional ordering or "eternal submission" can slide into implicit ontological subordination or modalism; supply a disciplined hermeneutic and conceptual vocabulary that preserves **ontological equality** while accounting for **economic order** without heresy.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarify technical distinctions (essence vs. persons; ontology vs. economy; relation of origin).
 - Critique formulations that treat functional subordination as an ontological asymmetry (argues they conflate roles with being).
 - Reframe legitimate talk of ordering in terms of relations grounded in the intra-Trinitarian relations of origin (begetting/going forth) and the economic missions, not as inequality of nature.
 - Offer exegetical touchstones (Christological and Johannine texts; Pauline authority-language) showing economy does not necessitate ontological inferiority.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Contemporary evangelical proponents of EFS (implicit interlocutors include Wayne Grudem, John Piper-adjacent discussions), classical Patristic and Reformation sources, contemporary analytic theology of persons and relations.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (primary), Christology (incarnational submission), revelation (Scriptural warrant for Trinitarian language), ecclesiology indirectly via models of authority and submission.
- **Closing line:** Preserve the doctrinal balance that the Son is eternally distinct in relation and mission yet ontologically one with the Father - uphold **functional order without ontological inequality** as the orthodox safeguard against heresy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Precision in distinctions:** Poythress emphasizes rigorous conceptual separation of **ontology (what God is)** from **economy (what God does)**, insisting theological language must track that separation to avoid doctrinal error.
- **Correction to some contemporary EFS accounts:** Where some EFS advocates treat eternal submission as a thesis about being, Poythress stresses that such claims often smuggle in a rank-ordering that undermines homoousios; he accepts ordered relations only as derivative and economic in character.
- **Emphasis on relations of origin:** Uses classical categories (begetting, procession) to locate distinctions among persons without implying inequality - functional roles are grounded in personal relations, not in essence.
- **Analytic-theological method:** Combines tight philosophical distinctions with careful scriptural exegesis rather than relying on analogies from human social relations (family, authority) that tend to naturalize hierarchy.
- **Reception and influence:** Valued in Reformed and conservative academic circles as a corrective to loose EFS rhetoric; used by seminarians and professors as a model of guarding orthodoxy while engaging contemporary questions about authority and gender/authority debates.
- **Enduring value:** A teaching tool for avoiding terminological slippage; durable as a concise corrective that re-centers creedal language and exegetical caution in Trinitarian work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS):** The thesis that the Son is eternally submissive in role to the Father. Poythress: acceptable only if strictly economic/relational and not conflated with ontological inferiority.
- **Ontological Trinity:** The inner life and being of God (essence, attributes, relations of origin). Must remain unity of essence.
- **Economic Trinity:** God's actions in history and the missions of Father, Son, Spirit; explains roles without adding to divine essence.
- **Subordinationism:** The heretical claim of inferiority in being; Poythress warns modern formulations can edge toward this if language is imprecise.
- **Perichoresis / mutual indwelling:** Mutual relationality of persons; used to account for unity without erasing distinction.
- **Relation of origin (begetting/procession):** Classical categories describing personhood relations; for Poythress they ground distinctions without implying inequality.
- **Authority vs. Submission (roles):** Functional terms that must be tied to economy and mission, not to substance or value of being.
- **Homoousios:** "Same substance"; doctrinal touchstone against any ontology that would place persons in different categories of being.
- **Modalism:** Error of collapsing persons into one person in different modes; Poythress uses it as counter-warning to avoid treating economic roles as mere modes.
- **Mission language (sending, reception):** Helpful for explaining ordered activity without ontological claims.
- **Exegetical model:** Readings of Johannine and Pauline passages that separate role-language from ontological claims.
- **Analogy caution:** Human analogies (e.g., family patriarchy) are pedagogically useful but theologically dangerous if pressed into ontological doctrine.
- **Function/Order without Inequality:** Short formula summarizing Poythress's corrective stance.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for technical distinctions (ontology vs economy; relation of origin) in systematic theology classes.
- As a **polemic resource** against careless EFS formulations that risk subordinationism.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading NT authority/submission texts with Trinitarian sensitivity.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching how to speak of divine roles (mission, sending) while affirming creedal unity.
