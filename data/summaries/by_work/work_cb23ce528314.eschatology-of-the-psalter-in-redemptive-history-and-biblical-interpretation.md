### TITLE
Eschatology of the Psalter - Geerhardus Vos (essay in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation, posthumous collection)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 20th-century Princeton/Reformed milieu; Vos a founding figure of redemptive-historical biblical theology. Essay published posthumously in Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation (1948). Responds to rising form- and historical-critical treatments that fragment Psalms into Sitz im Leben genres.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Psalter is an eschatological corpus that anticipates and typologically points to the Messianic consummation; its language of lament, kingship, Zion, and temple must be read in a redemptive-historical (Christocentric) framework rather than reduced to private devotional or purely cultic-historical items.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes the Psalter's unity of outlook: a persistent forward-looking hope despite diverse situational origins.
 - Identifies recurrent eschatological motifs (Davidic kingship, Zion, temple presence, vindication, resurrection language) and traces their telos in Christ.
 - Argues for typological interpretation: Davidic promises and psalmic petitions are real but servant-typical, fulfilled ultimately in the Messiah.
 - Maintains an already/not-yet tension: Psalms express present distress and present covenantal relation while projecting final restoration.
 - Concludes with theological reading rules: read Psalms in covenant history, with Christ as hermeneutical center.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit dialogue with form-critics (e.g., Gunkel-type approaches) and with liberal historicists who privatize or decontextualize the Psalms.
 - Aligns with and extends the Reformed tradition's Christocentric typology (post-Reformation exegesis and Princeton faculty milieu).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (esp. Davidic covenant), Christology (Messiah as fulfillment), kingdom/eschatology, typology, corporate personhood (Israel/Church), worship and temple theology.
- **Closing line:** The Psalter functions as covenantal, prophetic worship that both mirrors Israel's present plight and anticipates the Messianic consummation - Christ is the telos that integrates lament, kingship, and eschatological hope.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insists on a sustained redemptive-historical reading: psalmic language is not merely individual emotion or cultic relic but covenantal prophecy pointing forward to Christ.
 - Emphasizes typology as theological method (not allegory): David and Zion as types whose true reality appears in the Messiah.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects form-critical Sitz im Leben reductionism by restoring theological-canonical coherence.
 - Opposes pietistic privatization that strips Psalms of their communal and prophetic dimension.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Treats the Psalter's eschatology as a theological substructure of Israel's worship life - worship itself is eschatological anticipation.
 - Frames psalmic kingship-language as both present-institutional and prophetic-eschatological.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Deeply influential in Reformed biblical theology and in the development of redemptive-historical hermeneutics; forms part of the standard repertoire for Christ-centered readings of the Old Testament.
 - Cited by later scholars who argue for canonical and theological readings of the Psalms; used in Reformed preaching and liturgical reflection.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a compact exemplar of how to read poetic-wisdom/cultic literature within redemptive history.
 - Continues to shape exegetical practice where integration of Christology and canonical theology is desired.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Psalter eschatology:** The collective forward-looking hope embodied in the Book of Psalms; not incidental but constitutive.
- **Typological prophecy:** Historical persons/events (David, Zion, temple) as divinely ordained types fulfilled in Christ.
- **Davidic covenant:** The royal promise as a focal eschatological horizon; psalms appeal to and anticipate its consummation.
- **Zion theology:** Zion as both present symbol of divine presence and signpost to the eschatological kingdom.
- **Messianic king:** Christ as the true end of psalmic kingship language; resolves tensions of lament and vindication.
- **Already/not-yet:** Tension between present covenant experience and future consummation characteristic of the Psalter.
- **Corporate lament vs. individual lament:** Psalms function corporately as Israel's voice but also accommodate personal petition within covenant language.
- **Worship-as-anticipation:** Liturgical actions and words in the Psalter serve as anticipatory enactments of eschatological reality.
- **Temple/presence motif:** Temple language indexes divine presence now and in the eschaton; ultimately realized in Christ.
- **Vindication/resurrection motifs:** Petitions for vindication point beyond historical deliverance toward final resurrection and justification.
- **Canonical fulfillment:** The claim that the Psalter's promises find their true answer in the canonical fulfillment in Christ.
- **Typo-prophetic hermeneutic:** Method of reading that holds historical particularity and prophetic future in dialectical relation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for redemptive-historical and Christocentric readings of the Old Testament.
 - As a polemic tool against form-critical and reductionist accounts that deny theological unity.
 - As an exegetical model for preaching Psalms Christologically and integrating worship theology with eschatology.
