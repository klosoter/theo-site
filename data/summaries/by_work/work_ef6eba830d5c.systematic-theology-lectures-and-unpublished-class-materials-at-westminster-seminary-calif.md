### TITLE
Systematic Theology (lectures and unpublished class materials, Westminster Seminary California) - Robert B. Strimple

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century seminary lectures at Westminster Seminary California; delivered in a conservative Reformed and confessional evangelical milieu that emphasizes biblical theology, the Westminster Standards, and pastoral application.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** To present a comprehensive, confessional Reformed systematic theology that is exegetically grounded, covenant-centered, and pastorally oriented - showing how doctrine coheres across Scripture's covenant-historical plot and applies to church life.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Method: scriptural primacy, confessionally framed (Westminster Standards as normative guide), and dialogical engagement with contemporary and historical views.
 - Major loci proceed in classical order: revelation & Scripture; doctrine of God & Trinity; creation, providence, and anthropology; sin and fall; covenant theology (works / grace); Christology and soteriology (union with Christ, justification, sanctification); ecclesiology and sacraments; eschatology (millennial views emphasized in lectures cited).
 - Eschatological move: treats millennial questions within a covenantal-historical framework; surveys amillennial, postmillennial, and premillennial positions and weighs them against exegetical, theological, and confessional criteria.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Reformed and biblical-theological authorities (representative: Geerhardus Vos, Herman Bavinck, J. Gresham Machen by tradition of WSC), contemporary evangelical interlocutors, and explicit critiques of dispensationalist systems.
 - Uses patristic, scholastic, and modern exegetical voices to test positions.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, Scripture (authority, perspicuity), Trinity, attributes of God, creation, providence, anthropology, sin, covenant of works / covenant of grace, Christology, soteriology (justification, sanctification), church, sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), eschatology (millennial options, final judgment, new heavens & new earth).
- **Closing line:** A confessional, covenantal systematic theology that insists theological loci are explicated by and subordinated to the unfolding covenantal story of Scripture, with eschatology read in continuity with redemptive-history rather than dispensational discontinuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong covenantal-historical hermeneutic that ties each doctrinal locus to Israel-Christ-church continuity.
 - Pedagogical clarity: lecture formaims at equipping pastors and teachers, balancing academic precision with pastoral usage.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Explicit critique of dispensational premillennialism for its alleged breaks in covenant and redemptive-historical continuity.
 - Corrective to liberal theologies that privatize or demythologize doctrine; corrective to pietistic tendencies that divorce doctrine from ecclesial worship and sacraments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - No radical neologisms; rather, a re-articulation of classic Reformed terms (covenant of works/grace, union with Christ) within contemporary exegetical discussion.
 - Emphasizes the notion of covenant continuity as a hermeneutical axiom in adjudicating millennial options.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential primarily as a teaching corpus within Westminster Seminary California and among its students; used informally in Reformed classrooms and pastoral training.
 - Cited by students and some conservative Reformed ministers as a clear, confessional systematic reference though materials remain largely unpublished.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to do confessional systematic theology in the classroom: exegetical attention, confessional restraint, pastoral application.
 - Valuable as a compact survey that ties eschatology and millennial debate directly back to covenant theology and biblical-theological principles.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace / Covenant of Works:** Central organizing categories; used to interpret redemptive history and distinguish covenant administrations.
- **Covenantal-Historical Hermeneutic:** The guiding interpretive principle insisting continuity across testaments; key for evaluating millennial positions.
- **Union with Christ:** The soteriological pivot for justification, sanctification, and sacramental theology.
- **Westminster Standards:** Normative confessional touchstone for doctrinal formulations and for judging contemporary systems.
- **Amillennialism:** Treated as the covenantal reading's predominant Reformed option; interpreted as symbolic/realized aspects of Christ's reign inaugurated now and consummated eschatologically.
- **Historic Premillennialism / Dispensational Premillennialism:** Surveyed and critiqued; dispensationalism receives the most sustained correction for alleged covenant breaks.
- **Postmillennialism:** Considered for its optimism about gospel advance; evaluated against biblical promises and covenant continuity.
- **Eschatology:** Read as the consummation of covenant promises - emphasis on new heavens/new earth and final judgment rather than speculative chronology.
- **Authority & Perspicuity of Scripture:** Foundational for method; Scripture adjudicates doctrinal disputes.
- **Sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper):** Treated covenantally (signs & seals of the covenant), integral to ecclesiology and pastoral practice.
- **Church / Covenant Community:** Ecclesiology flows from covenant identity and communal union with Christ.
- **Redemptive History / Biblical Theology:** Emphasized as the matrix within which systematic loci are interpreted.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed terms and their pastoral articulations.
- As a **polemic** or corrective model against dispensational and liberal alternatives, especially on millennial questions.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating redemptive-historical reading into systematic claims, particularly in eschatology and covenant theology.
