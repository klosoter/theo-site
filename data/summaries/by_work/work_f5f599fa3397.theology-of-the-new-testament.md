### TITLE
**Rudolf Bultmann, Theology of the New Testament** (Ger. 1948; Eng. 1951, 2 vols.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Postwar German theology; dialogue with dialectical theology and existential philosophy (Heidegger). Culmination of Bultmanns form-critical program and his demythologizing proposal (cf. 1941 essay New Testament and Mythology).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can the NTs myth-laden proclamation be heard as Gods Word today? Answer: distinguish historical report from kerygma and interpret mythic language existentially as address that summons decision.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Method:** Historical-critical description of diverse NT corpora, unified not by a system but by the kerygma of the crucified-and-risen Lord as event of the Word.
 - **Jesus and early church:** Jesus preaching is the presupposition of NT theology; the theology proper is the early Churchs proclamation. Eschatology is reinterpreted from futurist-apocalyptic expectation to existential now.
 - **Paul:** Center in justification by faith as deliverance from self-reliance to authentic existence. Adam-Christ, flesh-Spirit, law-grace read as existential polarities, not metaphysical states.
 - **John and Johannine school:** Radicalized christology and dualism express revelation-concealment; pre-existence language functions mythically to speak the decisive encounter.
 - **Other witnesses:** Deutero-Paulines, Hebrews, Catholic Epistles register variations on the kerygma; ecclesial order and sacraments serve proclamation, not independent cultic efficacy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Heidegger (existential analysis), the history-of-religions school (Wrede, Dibelius), Gunkel, Harnack, Troeltsch; conversation and contest with Barth; later debate with Cullmann, Kasemann, Pannenberg, and salvation-history (Heilsgeschichte) approaches.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture (Word-event, witness), christology (functional lordship, kerygmatic identity), soteriology (justification, freedom, decision), eschatology (from apocalyptic to eschatological existence), pneumatology (Spirit as power of the Word), ecclesiology and sacraments (community of proclamation; baptism and eucharist as existential acts).
- **Closing line:** The theological center is the kerygma as Gods eschatological address confronting the hearer with the decision of faith, here and now.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Demythologizing:** Not discarding myth but interpreting it so its existential claim is heard.
 - **Kerygma over history:** The NT is normatively the proclamation of the Church, not a chronicle; Jesus ministry is a presupposition to Christian faith, which centers on the cross-resurrection proclamation.
 - **Existential interpretation:** Sin as inauthentic self-reliance; faith as being-claimed by the Word into authentic existence.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against liberal moralizing (Harnack) and naive historicism; against salvation-history models that objectify revelation as a sequence of events accessible to neutral history.
 - In tension with Barth: proximity in Word-event, distance in the status of myth, resurrection, and the role of historical particularity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Historie vs Geschichte; Word-event; decision (Entscheidung); self-understanding; eschatological existence.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Provoked major mid-century debates (demythologizing controversy). Shaped NT studies via form criticism and attention to Sitz im Leben. Critiqued by Kasemann (apocalyptic irreducibility), Cullmann and Pannenberg (salvation-history), conservatives and confessional Reformed theologians on resurrection and Scripture.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Clarifies the kerygmatic core of NT witness; sharpens hermeneutical self-awareness; models disciplined attention to literary forms and community context; offers a durable foil for doctrinal and canonical approaches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma:** The proclaimed message of Christ whose efficacy is event-like; theological nucleus of the NT.
- **Demythologization:** Interpreting mythic cosmology and miracle language to uncover their existential claim.
 - Not elimination but translation into categories of existence, decision, freedom, and guilt.
- **Myth:** Symbolic language situating human existence in a cosmos of powers; for the NT, idiom for speaking Gods eschatological act.
- **Word-event (Wortgeschehen):** Gods address occurs in proclamation; revelation is an event that seizes the hearer.
- **Decision (Entscheidung):** Faith as decisive response to the call; judgment occurs in the moment of encounter.
- **Historie vs Geschichte:** Empirical past vs history-as-significance; the NT speaks of the latter.
- **Eschatological existence:** The believers present participation in the end; the now of salvation eclipses timetable speculation.
- **Justification by faith:** Read existentially as liberation from self-justifying works to authentic dependence on Gods gift.
- **Flesh and Spirit:** Modes of existence, not substances; flesh as self-enclosed life, Spirit as life opened by the Word.
- **Pre-existence language:** In John and Paul, mythic idiom for the revelatory identity of Jesus as Gods decisive act.
- **Community of proclamation:** Church defined by hearing and speaking the Word; sacraments serve this proclamation.
- **Witness:** Scripture as human witness that mediates the divine address; authority is derivative and event-related.
- **Apocalyptic:** Symbolic horizon of early Christianity, to be interpreted for its existential import rather than calendrical predictions.
- **Heilsgeschichte (salvation-history):** A rival paradigm Bultmann resists; he prioritizes existential over historical-sequence claims.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** As foil and resource on Scripture-as-witness and Word-event hermeneutics.
 - **Christology and Soteriology:** For functional christology and existential construal of justification and resurrection.
 - **Eschatology:** Model of realized existence and critique of futurist speculation.
 - **Ecclesiology and Sacraments:** As kerygma-centered account that relativizes institutional and ritual efficacy.
