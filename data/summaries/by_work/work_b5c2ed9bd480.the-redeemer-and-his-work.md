### TITLE
"The Redeemer and His Work" - B. B. Warfield (Princeton; late 19th/early 20th century). 
Site usage: 1 reference; topic cited: **Munus Triplex** (threefold office).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Warfield, leading Princeton theologian, writing amid the late-19th/early-20th-century controversies over biblical authority, liberal theology, and the nature of atonement and mediation.
 - Part of the conservative Reformed reaction that sought to retain orthodox Christology and high views of Scripture against modernist reductions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ's redeeming work must be understood biblically and theologically as a mediatorial office encompassing **Prophet, Priest, and King** (Munus Triplex), integrally related to the hypostatic union and the covenantal plan of redemption.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of Scripture to show the threefold office as canonical and functional in NT portrayals of Christ.
 - Definition and delimitation of each office:
 - **Prophetic**: Christ as revealer and interpreter of God; authoritative proclamation.
 - **Priestly**: Christ as sacrifice, mediator, and perpetual intercessor.
 - **Kingly**: Christ's sovereign rule, execution of salvation, and consummation of the kingdom.
 - The offices are distinct in role yet inseparable in the one person of the Son; each contributes to the one cohesive work of redemption (including active and passive obedience).
 - Polemical corrections of contemporary theories that fragment or reduce the offices (e.g., purely moral-influence readings of atonement or denial of objective substitution).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformation and post-Reformation authorities (Calvin, Augustine, Reformed scholastics) and dialogues implicitly with liberal theologians and critical scholarship.
 - Deploys biblical exegesis (esp. Hebrews, the Gospels, Pauline material) and systematic-theological argumentation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, two natures), soteriology (atonement, justification), mediation, covenant theology (covenant of redemption), revelation (Christ as final revelation), ecclesiology in relation to kingly rule.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield situates the redemptive work squarely within the **threefold mediatorial office**, arguing that faithful theology must hold the offices together as the framework for understanding Christ's revelation, atonement, and sovereign rule.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strongly **biblicist and confessional**: wariness of speculative novelties; reads Munus Triplex not as merely schematic but rooted in canonical testimony.
 - Balances **objective and subjective** dimensions of redemption: affirms substitutionary satisfaction and the necessary appropriation of salvation by faith.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal reductions (moral influence, mere exemplarism) and pietistic separations of Christ's inner spirituality from his objective redemptive acts.
 - Contrasts with theologians who over-systematize the offices as discrete spheres - insists on their inseparable functioning in the one Mediator.
- **Conceptual / terminological notes**
 - Uses "munus" and "office" precisely: not merely titles but intrinsic functions in the work of the Redeemer.
 - Distinguishes **active obedience** (fulfillment of the law) and **passive obedience** (suffering and death) as elements within priestly and kingly frameworks.
- **Reception and influence**
 - High influence in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; frequently cited in seminary instruction on Christology and soteriology.
 - Contributed to the 20th-century recovery of a robust threefold-office approach in orthodox Protestant theology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a classical, succinct, exegetically-grounded model for teaching the offices of Christ; remains a standard corrective against modernist distortions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus Triplex (Threefold Office)** - Prophet, Priest, King; the central organizing motif for Christ's mediation.
- **Prophet** - Christ as final Revealer: preaching, interpretation of God's will, unveiling the covenant.
- **Priest** - Christ as sacrificer and intercessor: atonement, substitution, continual mediation before God.
- **King** - Christ as sovereign ruler: execution of salvation, governance of the church and the eschatological consummation.
- **Mediator / Mediation** - The Son's role between God and humanity; unity of offices under one person.
- **Active Obedience** - Christ's fulfillment of the law in life, securing righteousness for believers.
- **Passive Obedience** - Christ's sufferings and death as substitutionary atonement, satisfying divine justice.
- **Atonement (substitutionary / satisfaction)** - Objective removal of guilt and punishment through Christ's penal substitution; central in Warfield's account.
- **Covenant of Redemption** - Intra-Trinitarian pact ordering Christ's mediatorial mission; grounds for the unity of offices.
- **Hypostatic Union** - The theological presupposition that enables one person to perform all three offices truly.
- **Office (munus) vs. Function** - Office as ontological role anchored in personhood, distinct from merely functional descriptions.
- **Revelation (Christ as Word)** - Christ as the decisive manifestation of God; prophetic office as revelatory.
- **Kingdom of God** - Both present rule and future consummation enacted by the kingly office.
- **Expiation / Propitiation** - Aspects of priestly work describing satisfaction and removal of divine wrath.
- **Intercession** - Ongoing priestly activity of the risen Christ for believers.
