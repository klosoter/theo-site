### TITLE
**Paul's Christology of Divine Identity** (essay in Richard Bauckham, *Jesus and the God of Israel*)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century biblical-theological scholarship; Bauckham writes within a renewed interest in early high Christology and Jewish monotheism.
 - Reaction to positions that downplay early attributions of divine identity to Jesus (e.g., some social-scientific or low‑Christology reconstructions).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Paul does not merely assign divine *functions* to Jesus; he ascribes to Jesus the *identity* of the God of Israel. In Pauline theology Jesus is identified with Yahweh, so that monotheism is retained but the God of Israel is now disclosed and personified in Christ.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Close exegesis of key Pauline texts (e.g., Philippians 2:6-11; 1 Corinthians; Colossians 1; Romans 9-11; 1 Cor 8:6; Galatians) showing attributes, titles, roles, and worship language reserved for God applied to Jesus.
 - Historical-theological argument that Second Temple Jewish monotheism can accommodate this identification without collapsing into polytheism; early Christians saw Jesus as the God of Israel rather than as a secondary divine being.
 - Distinction between ascription of *divine identity* and later metaphysical systems: Bauckham emphasizes the Jewish confessional and revelatory character of Pauline theology, not Hellenistic metaphysics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages New Testament scholarship (e.g., N. T. Wright, James D. G. Dunn, Larry Hurtado) and debates about origins and development of Christology; interacts with studies of Jewish monotheism and early Christian worship.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Christology, monotheism, Lordship (kurios), pre-existence and incarnation, covenant, and implications for Trinitarian reading.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Paul proclaims Jesus not as a divine agent or functionary alongside God but as the living identity of the God of Israel disclosed in Christ - a confession that reframes Jewish monotheism around the revelation of Jesus.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes *identity* (Jesus as Yahweh) over categories like merely "divine function" or "honorific exaltation."
 - Prioritizes confessional and revelatory language (worship, naming, covenantal continuity) rather than speculative metaphysics.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against reconstructions that render Paul as only polytheistic, adoptionist, or ascribing merely instrumental divinity; challenges readings that separate high Christology from Jewish monotheism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - The phrase **"divine identity"** as an analytical pivot: focus on identity-transfer/identification (Yahweh = Jesus) rather than on levels of deity or ontological rank.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among those arguing for early high Christology; used widely in evangelical, catholic, and Reformed conversations as evidence for the early attribution of deity to Jesus.
 - Stimulated further discussion on how monotheism and christology cohere in earliest Christianity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust exegetical template for reading Pauline texts Christologically and for integrating biblical Christology with doctrine of revelation and Trinitarian reflection.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine identity** - Bauckham's core term: Jesus is identified as the God (Yahweh) of Israel, not merely God‑like.
- **Yahweh‑Christ identification** - The claim that Pauline language equates Jesus with the God of Israel.
- **Jewish monotheism (continuity)** - Argument that Paul's christology does not abandon monotheism but reconfigures it around Jesus.
- **Kurios (Lord) and Theos (God)** - Titles applied to Jesus in Pauline texts; Bauckham shows their overlap with Old Testament language for Yahweh.
- **Worship/adoration** - Evidence: early Christian prayer and worship addressed to Jesus, used as a marker of attribution of divine identity.
- **Pre‑existence and incarnation** - Pauline texts (e.g., Philippians) present Christ as pre‑existent and divine in identity.
- **Creator/Agent/Judge** - Functions and roles ascribed to Jesus in Paul that are traditionally Yahweh‑exclusive (e.g., Colossians 1; eschatological judge).
- **Revelation of God in Christ** - Theological frame: Jesus as the self‑revelation of the God of Israel.
- **Identity vs. function distinction** - Bauckham stresses identity: not merely what Jesus does, but who he is.
- **Confessional / liturgical data** - Use of worship texts and hymnic material in Paul as primary evidence for early high Christology.
- **Christology and Trinity** - While not systematic Trinitarian theology, Bauckham's thesis supports Trinitarian readings by showing early divine attribution to Jesus within monotheistic confession.
- **Exegetical model** - Method: textual exegesis anchored in Jewish monotheistic context to interpret Pauline language.
- **Polemic use** - Employed against theories that locate high Christology late or foreign to Jewish monotheism.
- **Definition source** - Used as a concise source defining what it means in Paul to ascribe God‑identity to Christ.
- **Conceptual pivot** - Serves as a pivot for discussions linking biblical data (OT/NT) with doctrines of revelation and Trinitarian theology.
