### TITLE
Commentarius in Epistolam ad Hebraeos (Author: Unknown)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Latin commentary tradition; likely early modern/Reformed-scholastic milieu (17th century type). Anonymous authorship suggests use in university or seminary circles where Hebrean exegesis served confessional and polemical ends. Interacts with patristic readings, Calvinist exegesis of Hebrews, and scholastic formulations of covenant theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Hebrews presents Christ as the definitive covenantal Mediator and High Priest whose once-for-all sacrifice effects final atonement and consummates God's covenantal plan. The commentary reads Hebrews through a covenantal and christological lens, aiming to show how Christ's person (two natures) and work (priesthood, sacrifice, intercession) secure salvation under the Pactum Salutis / Covenant of Redemption.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical walk through Hebrews (major paragraphs on Hebrews 1-4; 5-10; 11-13).
 - Reconstructs Christ's priesthood typologically (Melchizedek as paradigm) and doctrinally (eternal mediator).
 - Theologically synthesizes Hebrews with covenantal doctrine:
 - Christ as **covenant head** and federal representative (Pactum Salutis implications).
 - The eternal agreement between Father and Son (Covenant of Redemption) as ground of the incarnation and atoning obedience.
 - Use of **communicatio idiomatum** to justify attributing priestly acts to the one person of Christ.
 - Practical/doctrinal conclusions: assurance of finality of atonement, sanctification's relation to justification, ecclesial use of Hebrews for preaching perseverance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Hebrews text (critical passages: 4:14-16; 7-10), Church Fathers (esp. Augustine, Athanasius for Christology), Reformers (Calvin, but also later Reformed scholastics), polemics against Roman Catholic sacramental/works-based readings, Lutheran alternative emphases on forensic justification.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, covenant (Pactum Salutis/Covenant of Redemption), Trinity (intra-Trinitarian planning), Christology (two natures, communicatio idiomatum), soteriology (atonement, justification, sanctification), priesthood and sacrificial theology, typology.
- **Closing line:** The work's center of gravity is a covenantal-cruciform Christology: Hebrews portrayed as the canonical locus where Christ's person (two natures united) and mediatorial office (eternal high priest) consummate the divine pact to redeem and perfect God's people once for all.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong linking of Hebrews' priesthood language to the **Pactum Salutis**, reading Christ's priestly mediatorship as the execution of an intra-Trinitarian covenant plan.
 - Explicit use of **communicatio idiomatum** to transfer both active and passive salvific acts to the one person of Christ in interpretive moves on Hebrews 2-5.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushback against purely moral-typological or sacramental readings that diffuse the finality of Christ's sacrifice; counters Roman confusion of sacrificial efficacy with Eucharistic repetition.
 - Distinguishes Reformed federal headship from Lutheran emphases that may underplay the Covenant of Redemption's planning role.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic integration of Covenant of Redemption categories into Hebraic exegesis (treats Hebrews' "better covenant" language as echoing a pre-temporal pact).
 - Tight coupling of Melchizedek typology with federal-headship discourse.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries as an exegetical model linking Hebrews to covenant theology; anonymous status limited wider fame but comments appear in later Reformed dogmatics as exegetical precedents.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Useful for students tracing how Hebrews can ground federal theology and for illustrating the application of communicatio idiomatum in pastoral exposition of Christ's priesthood.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (Pact of Salvation):** Read as the intra-Trinitarian plan committing Father and Son to the economy of redemption; Hebrews is treated as the narrative execution of that pact.
- **Christ as Covenant Head / Federal Representative:** Christ functions as the new Adam/true Israel and as the head whose obedience and sacrifice secure covenant blessings for elect believers.
- **Covenant of Redemption:** The pre-temporal agreement between Father and Son; used to explain incarnation motive and the certainty of Christ's mediatorial actions.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum (Communication of Properties):** Employed to ascribe priestly suffering and sacerdotal efficacy to the one person of Christ (e.g., divine omnipotence + human suffering coherently united in his mediation).
- **High Priest (Melchizedek Typology):** Melchizedek used as a type of Christ's eternal priesthood-argues for qualitative superiority and permanence of Christ's office.
- **Once-for-all Sacrifice (Hebrews 9-10):** Emphasizes finality and completeness of atonement; counters views of repetitive or incomplete sacrificial efficacy.
- **Mediator of a Better Covenant:** Christ as inaugurator and guarantor of a superior covenantal arrangement, supplanting old covenant shadows.
- **Perfected Conscience / Sanctification:** The effect of Christ's sacrifice on the believer's inner life-Hebrews' soteriology ties justification to sanctifying transformation.
- **Intercession:** Ongoing priestly advocacy of Christ in heaven; guaranteed by covenantal promises and his unchangeable priesthood.
- **Typology vs. Allegory:** Prefers historical-typological correspondence grounded in canonical economy rather than loose allegorizing.
- **Federal Headship:** Distinguishes corporate guilt/merit via representative headship; used to explain imputation and solidarity in Hebrews' argument.
- **Expiation / Propitiation:** Terms applied to describe Christ's atoning act as satisfying divine justice within covenantal terms.
- **Sacramental Use:** Cautions against equating ecclesial rites with Christ's singular salvific act; supports Protestant sacramental theology that points to, but does not repeat, atonement.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for **covenant theology** (linking Hebraic texts to Pactum Salutis formulations).
 - As an exegetical model and polemic resource against **Roman Catholic sacrificial/repetition** claims and against non-federal Christologies.
 - As a conceptual pivot for teaching **communicatio idiomatum** in pastoral Christology and preaching on Hebrews.
