### TITLE
Preaching and Leading Worship - William H. Willimon

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century American mainline Protestant/Wesleyan milieu. Arises amid liturgical renewal, growing interest in pastoral homiletics, and debates over congregational identity and the role of worship in formation. Practical-theological orientation intended for pastors and worship leaders rather than purely academic audiences.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Preaching and worship leadership are inseparable acts of the gathered church; the sermon must be understood as a formative, ecclesial event that mediates the Word and shapes communal identity and discipleship.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Diagnosis: many congregations suffer from either "sermon-only" reductions of preaching or "entertainment" consumerism in worship; both impoverish formation.
 - Normative claim: preaching must be both **pastoral** (forming, nurturing, comforting) and **prophetic** (calling, confronting, convicting), always in sacramental relation to Word and Table.
 - Practical moves: guidance on sermon preparation, liturgical integration, the preacher's pastoral presence, and strategies for engaging congregation as actors (not spectators).
 - Formation emphasis: worship and preaching are primary means of Christian formation-affecting belief, habit, and moral imagination.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Wesleyan and mainline liturgical resources, homileticians and pastoral theologians of the 20th century, broader liturgical renewal movement; draws implicitly on biblical narrative and ecclesial tradition rather than technical systematic theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (Scripture as event), ecclesiology (gathered church, formation), sacramentology (Word and Table interrelation), Christology (preaching as proclamation of the crucified and risen Lord), pastoral theology.
- **Closing line:** Worship-leading and preaching are the formative ecclesial practices by which the Word becomes the church's life-preaching not as an isolated act but as the church's sacramental, communal speech.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the **preacher is first a pastor of the assembly**, not merely an orator or rhetorician.
 - Emphasis on preaching as **ecclesial action**-the sermon functions within liturgy and sacraments rather than as a stand-alone performance.
 - Combines prophetic confrontation with pastoral care; encourages risk-taking preaching that retains pastoral responsibility.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against both mechanistic homiletics (formulaic homiletical forms) and consumer-driven worship practices.
 - Correction of reductive "information-focused" sermon models by stressing formation, imagination, and habit.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Framing the worship leader as a shepherd/steer of communal imagination and practice.
 - Treating the sermon explicitly as a mediating sacramental act-bridging homiletics and sacramentology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read among Methodist, mainline Protestant pastors and seminary instructors; used as a practical corrective toward liturgical-minded preaching.
 - Cited in homiletics courses for pastoral formation; less influential in some evangelical contexts that prioritize conversionist or expository models.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Useful corrective to purely technical homiletics; durable for pastors seeking liturgical integration and congregational formation.
 - Provokes renewed attention to preaching's ethical and communal effects, not merely its rhetorical success.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Preaching as pastoral word:** Sermon functions primarily to care for and form the congregation, not merely to inform.
- **Prophetic preaching:** Preaching that convicts and challenges the congregation toward repentance and justice.
- **Word and sacrament:** Constant interplay-sermon must be integrated with Scripture reading and Eucharist.
- **Gathered church / assembly:** Emphasis on the congregation as actor; worship is communal, not performance.
- **Liturgy as pedagogy:** Worship forms habits and dispositions; liturgy teaches as it rehearses faith.
- **Preacher as steward:** The preacher is a steward of the Word and of the congregation's spiritual life.
- **Sacramental imagination:** Seeing ordinary worship elements as means of grace that shape belief and practice.
- **Narrative and imagination:** Preaching that employs biblical narrative to reorient communal imagination and identity.
- **Contextual formation:** Sermons must attend to congregational context-social, economic, cultural-while remaining rooted in Scripture.
- **Homiletical theology:** Theology of preaching-sermon as theological act that discloses Christ to the assembly.
- **Communal formation:** Worship and preaching as primary routes by which character and discipleship are formed.
- **Anti-entertainment critique:** Critical language against consumerist or entertainment-driven worship models.
- **Practical pastoral techniques:** Guidance on preparation, presence, voice, and liturgical coordination.
- **Risk and care balance:** Encourages daring proclamation tempered by pastoral responsibility.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for homiletics that situates preaching within worship and sacrament.
 - As a **polemic** against consumerist/performative worship and formulaic preaching.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model** for pastors seeking to integrate sermon, liturgy, and congregational formation.
