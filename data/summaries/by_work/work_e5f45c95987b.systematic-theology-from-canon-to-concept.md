### TITLE
Systematic Theology: From Canon to Concept - Stephen J. Wellum

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical-Reformed academic milieu (early 21st century). Responds to fragmentation between biblical theology and dogmatics in evangelical scholarship and to systematic theologies that prioritize philosophical systems over canonical exegesis.
 - A pedagogical text aimed at advanced students and pastors who must move from careful reading of Scripture to coherent doctrinal articulation.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Systematic theology must be disciplined by the canon: theological concepts should be derived from, and constrained by, canonical exegesis. Put simply: move *from canon to concept*, not from abstract philosophy to scriptural proof-texting.
 - The problem addressed: how to construct coherent, faithful doctrinal loci without divorcing them from the Scriptures' narrative-canonical grammar and Christocentric center.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes a methodological foundation grounded in the normativity of the canon and the priority of biblical-theological work.
 - Argues for a covenantal and Christ-centered grid as the integrative principle for organizing doctrines.
 - Demonstrates how canonical theology yields theological concepts (God, Trinity, Christ, salvation, church, sacraments, eschatology) and how those concepts function in systematic formulation.
 - Discusses the role of tradition, confessional formulations, and reason - allowing tradition and philosophical reflection but subordinating them to the canon-derived conceptual framework.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues broadly with the Reformed confessional tradition (historical theology and confessions) and contemporary evangelical/biblical-theological movements.
 - Interacts critically with methods that either (a) over-philosophize dogmatics, or (b) treat biblical theology and systematic theology as independent enterprises.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (normativity, hermeneutics)
 - Covenant theology as organizing principle
 - Doctrine of God and the Trinity
 - Christology (person and work; incarnational emphasis)
 - Soteriology and the order of salvation within covenant history
 - Ecclesiology and the sacraments
 - Eschatology (inaugurated eschatology / consummation)
 - Methodological loci: relation of biblical exegesis to systematic categories

- **Closing line**
 - Wellum's theological center of gravity: faithful systematic theology begins with the canon - a covenantal, Christ-centered reading of Scripture that yields concepts for confessional and pastoral theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological slogan made programmatic: the disciplined pathway *from canon to concept* rather than vice versa.
 - Strong covenantal and Christocentric integration: covenant history is the primary organizing principle for doctrinal loci.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against systematic accounts that privilege philosophical categories or speculative metaphysics over canonical grammar.
 - Seeks middle ground between purely descriptive biblical theology (that refuses doctrinal synthesis) and synthetic dogmatics that underread the canon.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Frames theological formulation as "conceptualization constrained by canonical theology" - emphasizing the formative force of biblical categories on doctrinal language.
 - Recasts confessional formulations as interpretive summaries of canonical theology rather than autonomous systems.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received positively within Reformed and evangelical academic circles as a methodological corrective and teaching resource.
 - Used increasingly in seminary syllabi to bridge exegetical courses and dogmatics; commended for practical guidance in constructing loci faithful to Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical framework for students learning to translate exegesis into doctrine.
 - Useful corrective for theologians tempted to abstract theological concepts from the narrative and covenantal flow of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Canon / canonical theology** - Scripture as normative whole; source-material for doctrinal concepts.
- **From canon to concept** - programmatic method: derive theological concepts from canonical reading rather than impose external categories.
- **Covenantal framework** - covenant history structures redemptive-historical development of doctrine.
- **Christocentricity** - Christ as the hermeneutical center shaping all loci.
- **Theological grammar** - the Scripture-shaped categories and patterns that govern doctrinal formulation.
- **Analogy of faith (reformed sense)** - internal coherence of Scripture used to interpret and articulate doctrine.
- **Confessional mediation** - confessions as distilled expressions of canonically derived concepts, useful but subordinate to Scripture.
- **Bounded philosophical theology** - philosophical reflection permitted but constrained by biblical categories.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - emphasis on already/not-yet within covenantal consummation (used to order soteriology and eschatology).
- **Loci approach reconfigured** - classic loci retained but organized by covenantal narrative and canonical priorities.
- **Normativity of narrative** - Scriptural story (creation-fall-redemption-consummation) as the background grammar for doctrine.
- **Conceptual restraint** - principle that theological concepts must not transgress canonical meaning.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source** for integrating exegesis and dogmatics in curricula.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** against philosophically driven or confessional-only systems.
 - As an **exegetical-to-doctrinal model** for producing Christocentric, covenantal treatments of standard loci.
