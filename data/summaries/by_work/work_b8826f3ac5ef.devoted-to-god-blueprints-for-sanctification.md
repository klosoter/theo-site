### TITLE
Devoted to God: Blueprints for Sanctification - Sinclair B. Ferguson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century Reformed evangelicalism; Ferguson writing as a pastor-theologian within the conservative Reformed revival (Ligonier/RTS milieu).
 - Pastoral-analytic style intended for pastors, teachers, and mature laity seeking doctrinally rich practical theology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christian sanctification is the Spirit-worked outworking of union with Christ: a progressive, covenantal, Christ-centered transformation that flows from justification and is shaped by Scripture, means of grace, and experiential mortification/vivification.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: the human condition - sin as both nature and act producing guilt, pollution, and death - requires more than moral effort.
 - Foundation: justification and union with Christ as the sole ground of sanctification; the Spirit applies Christ to effect holiness.
 - Dynamics: two-fold process of mortification (putting sin to death) and vivification (putting on new life) described through spiritual disciplines, means of grace, and pastoral care.
 - Practical loci: faith and repentance as ongoing habits; prayer, Word, sacraments, and community as formative means.
 - Eschatological horizon: final judgment and eternal states give urgency and hope to present struggle.
 - Application: instruction on spiritual gifts, Christian growth patterns, pastoral strategies for dealing with guilt, and perseverance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy engagement with Reformed Puritans (e.g., Owen), Calvin, and 20th-century Reformed theologians; dialogue with pastoral theology and contemporary evangelicalism.
 - Implicit contrasts with pietistic moralism, antinomian tendencies, and therapeutic culture.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification, justification, union with Christ, Holy Spirit (illumination and sanctifying work), sin (origin and consequences), repentance and faith, sacraments, spiritual gifts, eschatology (individual and cosmic), final judgment.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically robust and pastorally practical, Ferguson frames sanctification as the Spirit-mediated outworking of union with Christ, disciplined by Scripture and hope, corrective to both moralism and cheap grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that sanctification is rooted in legal-forensic realities (justification) yet must be pursued experientially by mortification/vivification.
 - Integration of Puritan pastoral acuity with modern pastoral concerns: concreteness about guilt, shame, and pastoral care without sentimentalism.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects moralistic sanctification models that treat holiness as primarily ethical self-improvement.
 - Opposes antinomian readings that detach holiness from means of grace and discipline.
 - Nuances contrasts with Wesleyan-Perfectionist strains by retaining progressive, dependent, Christ-centered growth rather than instantaneous perfection.

- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - "Blueprints" metaphor: sanctification as a designed, ordered process (not merely spontaneous feeling), implying both structure (doctrine) and practice (discipline).
 - Emphasizes the twin tasks of mortification and vivification as the architecture of holiness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries, pastorates, and adult education; praised for clarity and pastoral utility.
 - Influential in shaping contemporary Reformed pastoral theology and small-group discipleship curricula.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact bridge between doctrinal theology and pastoral practice; reliable for preaching, discipleship design, and theological reflection on the Christian life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive work of being made holy; central theme tying doctrine to pastoral practice.

- **Union with Christ**
 - The ontological and relational ground of all spiritual life and growth; basis for both justification and sanctification.

- **Mortification / Vivification**
 - Mortification: putting sin to death by the Spirit and obedience.
 - Vivification: enlivening by the Spirit to bear fruit and pursue godliness.

- **Justification**
 - Forensic basis that secures the believer and enables sanctification; distinguished from sanctification's process.

- **Holy Spirit (illumination & sanctifying work)**
 - Dual role: reveals Christ through Scripture and personally transforms; illumination grounds assured knowledge, sanctification grounds ethical change.

- **Faith and Repentance**
 - Not single events only but ongoing dispositions and practices central to daily sanctification.

- **Sin (nature, origin, consequences)**
 - Treated as both inherited corruption and personal transgression; leads to guilt, pollution, and death that sanctification must address.

- **Guilt, Pollution, Death**
 - Categories for pastoral diagnosis: legal guilt (forgiveness), moral pollution (cleansing), existential death (new life).

- **Spiritual Gifts**
 - Considered within sanctification: gifts are given for edification and to shape holiness in community.

- **Final Judgment & Eternal States**
 - Eschatological frame providing motivation and perspective for present obedience and hope.

- **Revelation / Illumination (Scripture)**
 - Scripture as primary means; the Spirit's illuminating work is indispensable to understanding and applying truth.

- **Covenant framework**
 - Sanctification is covenantal: disciplined by promises, obligations, means, and the community of faith.

- **Blueprints (metaphor)**
 - Suggests ordered, teachable, replicable patterns for pastoral formation.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for sanctification that balances forensic theology and practical holiness.
- As a **polemic** against moralism and antinomianism in pastoral contexts.
- As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching and discipleship (mortification/vivification template).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions linking pneumatology, soteriology, and eschatology in Reformed curricula.
