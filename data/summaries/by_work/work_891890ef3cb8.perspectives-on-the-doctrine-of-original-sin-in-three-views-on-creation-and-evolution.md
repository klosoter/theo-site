### TITLE
"Perspectives on the Doctrine of Original Sin" - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (in Three Views on Creation and Evolution)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical/Reformed conversation about human origins, anthropology, and a resurgence of interest in how original sin is transmitted given modern biology and philosophical challenges. Gaffin writes from a conservative Reformed, covenantal framework engaging contemporary creation/anthropology debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How is original sin transmitted to human beings - by traducianism (transmission of a human soul or whole human nature from parents) or creationism (God creates each soul individually)? Gaffin contends that a Reformed doctrine of original sin is best preserved by a traducian account suitably qualified by divine agency and covenantal realities.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Close exegesis of biblical texts implicated in origin and transmission of sin (Genesis, Romans, 1 Corinthians), emphasizing continuity and the corporate nature of humanity.
 - Theological retrieval of Reformed confessions and patristic resources that undergird a tradition-friendly reading of traducianism.
 - Philosophical and theological critique of creationism: problems with explaining immediate transmission of guilt/corruption, the ontological unity of the human person, and the plausibility of a dual-origin soul/body anthropology.
 - Positive proposal: a qualified traducianism that recognizes God as the ultimate creator while affirming personal continuity and real, transmitted corruption consistent with federal headship and corporate solidarity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (esp. Pauline theology), classical and medieval theologians (Augustine, later scholastics), Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed writers (Calvinic tradition), and contemporary defenders of creationism and alternative anthropologies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (soul/body), original sin (guilt and corruption), imputation vs. transmission, covenant and federal headship, image of God, divine creation and providence.
- **Closing line:** Gaffin centers the doctrine of original sin within a covenantal-Reformed anthropology that prefers a qualified traducianism as the most coherent way to account for biblical testimony to human unity, inherited corruption, and divine sovereignty.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses the **ontological unity** of the human person (no neat binary between an independently created soul and biologically derived body).
 - Frames traducianism within **divine agency** (God is still creator and sustainer even if human souls are derived), avoiding crude materialistic or mechanistic readings.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges creationism for leaving unexplained the immediacy of original guilt and the phenomenology of inherited corruption.
 - Corrects simple appeals to Augustine or scholasticism by reasserting Reformed covenantal motifs (federal headship) as decisive for how sin and solidarity operate.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advocates for careful language distinguishing **transmission** (how corruption/guilt gets to persons) from **creation** (God as ultimate source), reducing false dichotomies.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed circles as a robust theological defense of traditional positions on human nature and sin.
 - Used in broader evangelical debates as a learned exemplar of integrating biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and contemporary philosophical reflection.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how to bring confessional theology to bear on modern problems in anthropology and bioethics.
 - Serves as a compact defense of traducianism that is both theologically dense and pastorally cognizant.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Traducianism:** The view that the soul (or human nature) is transmitted from parents to offspring; here defended as the best-fit account for inherited sin and human unity.
- **Creationism (of the soul):** The position that God immediately creates each soul at conception/formation; critiqued for explanatory gaps regarding solidarity and imputation.
- **Original sin:** The inherited corruption and/or guilt transmitted to humanity from Adam; Gaffin insists on both the reality of corruption and the corporate dimensions of guilt.
- **Imputation vs. transmission:** Distinction between God accounting guilt to sinners (imputation) and the actual passing-on of corrupted nature (transmission); Gaffin emphasizes interplay rather than mutual exclusion.
- **Federal headship:** Adam as representative whose action affects the covenantally related community; used to explain corporate responsibility and the logic of original sin.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Treated as personal/relational rather than merely substantial; implication for how the human person is a unified agent.
- **Ensoulment:** Debated philosophical term; Gaffin reframes the question to focus on personhood continuity and the origin of human nature.
- **Ontological unity:** Key concept stressing that human persons are a single substance/person, resisting bifurcated soul/body origins.
- **Divine agency/creatio continua:** Affirmation that God remains the ultimate creator even if human souls are derived through procreation.
- **Corruption (peccatum originale):** The inherited disordering of the human will and passions; central to why traducianism is attractive.
- **Guilt (culpa):** The forensic aspect often linked to imputation and discussed alongside transmission.
- **Covenantal solidarity:** Social-theological framework for understanding how one act (Adam's sin) pertains to many.
- **Exegetical loci:** Romans 5, Genesis 5/1, 1 Corinthians used as primary biblical pivots.
- **Philosophical loci:** Personal identity, substance dualism vs. hylomorphic (form-matter) accounts are engaged.

How this work is used:
- As a **definitional and exegetical resource** for traducianism within Reformed theology.
- As a **polemic** against creationist-of-the-soul positions in contemporary evangelical anthropology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking orthodox doctrines of sin, covenant, and human unity for teaching and further theological construction.
