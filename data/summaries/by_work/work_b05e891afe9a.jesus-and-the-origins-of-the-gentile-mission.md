### TITLE
Jesus and the Origins of the Gentile Mission - Michael F. Bird

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical/academic discussion (early 21st century). Engages recent Jesus-research, Second Temple studies, and debates about the historical Jesus and early Christian mission; written for scholars and informed pastors interested in the historical grounding of Gentile mission.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Bird argues that the mission to the Gentiles originates in the ministry and intentions of Jesus himself, not merely in later apostolic or Pauline developments. The book asks whether the Gentile mission is a post-resurrection innovation or inherent to Jesus' own program.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of relevant Gospel traditions (Synoptics and John) and Acts to identify Jesus' actions and sayings that point beyond ethnic Israel.
 - Examination of specific episodes: table fellowship, healing of Gentiles, encounters with the centurion and Syrophoenician woman, the Great Commission, and parables (banquet, net).
 - Argument for continuity: Jesus' ministry embodies an expanding horizon - markers in his ministry anticipate Gentile inclusion and provide justification for apostolic mission.
 - Comparative critique of alternative models that posit a strict "Jesus-to-Jews" mandate with Gentile outreach as a later apostolic compromise.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages mainstream Jesus scholars and historians of early Christianity (e.g., N. T. Wright, James D. G. Dunn, E. P. Sanders broadly), historical-critical Gospel studies, and Acts scholarship; dialogue with scholars who advocate a more Jewish-limited Jesus mission.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Christology** (Jesus as Israel's representative and inaugurator of a wider covenantal horizon),
 - **Covenant and election** (how Israel's election relates to Gentile inclusion),
 - **Missiology** (origins and theological justification for mission),
 - **Eschatology** (inaugurated eschatology as motive for expansion),
 - **Ecclesiology** (identity and composition of the early community).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The Gentile mission is not an afterthought of post‑resurrection church policy but a trajectory implicit in Jesus' ministry - Jesus himself inaugurates the boundary‑crossing, thereby grounding universal mission in his person and work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents a strong **continuity model**: mission to the nations is rooted in Jesus' own ministry rather than merely in apostolic or Pauline innovation.
 - Emphasizes **praxis over proclamation**-Jesus' table fellowship and healings function as theological acts signaling inclusion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against models that confine Jesus to an exclusively Jewish mission and then locate Gentile mission as a corrective by the apostles or Paul.
 - Distinguishes between simplistic readings of the Great Commission as sole proof-text and a broader constellation of Gospel evidence.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Promotes the heuristic of **"missionary intent of Jesus"** - treating actions, parables, and social patterns in Jesus' ministry as intentional moves with missional horizon.
 - Frames table fellowship and marginal encounters as **theological acts** that anticipate covenantal extension.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well regarded in evangelical and missiological circles; used in debates about biblical foundations for mission and in courses on New Testament theology.
 - Criticized by some historians who caution about inferring programmatic intent from episodic narratives; debated in more skeptical scholarly quarters.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact, evidence-heavy resource for grounding Christian mission in the life of Jesus.
 - Useful corrective to views that sever Jesus' ministry from later missionary praxis; stimulates rethinking of covenantal and ecclesial boundaries.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mission to the Gentiles:** The ecclesial outreach to non-Jews; Bird argues it is rooted in Jesus' ministry.
- **Missionary intent of Jesus:** The claim that Jesus' words and deeds express an orientation toward Gentile inclusion.
- **Table fellowship:** Meals and social eating as incarnational signs of covenant inclusion; central evidence for boundary-breaking.
- **Boundary-crossing acts:** Healings, table invites, parable outcomes that transgress purity/ethnic barriers.
- **Great Commission:** Matthew 28:19-20 treated as one element among many, not sole proof.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The idea that Jesus' ministry begins the eschatological reversal that opens the nations to salvation.
- **Covenantal expansion:** Theological framing of Gentile inclusion as extension of Israel's covenantal role.
- **Continuity model (vs. discontinuity model):** The thesis that Jesus' and the church's missions form a single trajectory.
- **Universal Israel / Israel typology:** Reading Jesus as embodying/fulfilling Israel such that the nations inherit through him.
- **Parable evidence (banquet, net):** Parables read as prophetic imagery of ethnic widening.
- **Acts as theological bridge:** Acts interprets apostolic mission in continuity with Jesus rather than in rupture.
- **Missional hermeneutic:** Method that privileges Jesus' practices as interpretive keys for mission theology.
- **Polemic against "Jesus-for-Jews-only":** Uses narrative and thematic exegesis to challenge that position.
- **Christological grounding of mission:** Mission flows from who Jesus is (representative, king, inaugurator), not merely from later church strategy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the theological claim that Gentile mission originates in Jesus.
 - As a **polemic resource** against views that confine Jesus' mission to ethnic Israel.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Gospel narratives and Acts as a coherent missional trajectory.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sermons and mission training to root outreach in Jesus' incarnational practice.
