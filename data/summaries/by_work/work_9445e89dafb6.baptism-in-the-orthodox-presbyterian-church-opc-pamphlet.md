### TITLE
Baptism in the Orthodox Presbyterian Church - John M. Frame (OPC pamphlet)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-late 20th century Reformed confessional milieu; produced for the Orthodox Presbyterian Church to state and defend OPC practice and polity on baptism.
 - Engages intra-Protestant disputes (Reformed paedobaptism vs Baptist credobaptism), and assumes Westminster Standards and OPC Book of Church Order as background authorities.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Baptism in the OPC is a covenant sacrament: administered to believers and their children as a **sign and seal** of the covenant of grace, not as an instrument that automatically effects regeneration.
 - The pamphlet addresses three contested issues: **mode** of baptism, **infant vs believer** baptism, and **efficacy** (what baptism accomplishes).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical and confessional case for paedobaptism:
 - Uses covenant theology parallels (circumcision/Genesis 17) and NT texts (Acts 2; 1 Cor 7:14; household baptisms) to justify infant inclusion.
 - Denies baptismal regeneration:
 - Baptism is a means of grace in a covenantal sense (signifying and sealing promises) but does not itself confer saving faith or regeneration.
 - Mode is secondary:
 - Water application (sprinkling, pouring, immersion) is not the essence; historical Reformed practice favors sprinkling/pouring as fitting the sign and continuity with Old Covenant rites.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiastical implications:
 - Infant baptism grants church membership and requires catechesis and discipline, but admission to the Lord's Supper presupposes credible profession and evidence of grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary appeal to the Westminster Confession and Larger/Shorter Catechisms, OPC Book of Church Order.
 - Engages Biblical texts and precedents (Pauline household references, Acts 2).
 - Polemically addresses Baptist critiques and internal evangelical misunderstandings (e.g., presumptive regeneration).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (unity of Old and New covenants)
 - Sacramentology (nature and marks of sacraments)
 - Soteriology (regeneration vs sign)
 - Ecclesiology (membership, discipline)
 - Scripture as primary warrant for sacramental practice

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Baptism, as taught and practiced in the OPC, is a covenantal sign and seal given to believers and their children: vital for identity and nurture within the church but not itself the means of saving regeneration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, confessional precision: insists on differentiating sacramental **sign/seal** functions from causal regeneration; careful pastoral application to infant membership.
 - Emphasizes the continuity of covenant signs (circumcision→baptism) as normative for canonically Reformed practice.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects Baptists by arguing household baptisms and circumcision analogy warrant infant baptism.
 - Distinguishes from lax presumptions of automatic infant salvation: baptism implies covenant responsibility and catechetical obligation, not guaranteed election.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reiterates and sharpens language of "sign and seal" with practical ecclesial prescriptions: baptism is a covenantal marker that obliges nurture and discipline rather than a private assurance of regeneration.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Functions as a standard OPC confessional summary for congregations and officers; widely used in OPC training and by conservative Presbyterian circles.
 - Cited in intra-Protestant debates as a concise, pastoral defense of paedobaptism aligned with Westminster Standards.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model of integrating confessional theology, biblical exegesis, and pastoral polity.
 - Endures as a clear primer for teaching church officers and laity the Reformed sacramental position.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Paedobaptism** - infant baptism; argued for by covenant continuity and household baptisms in Scripture.
- **Credobaptism** - believer-only baptism; identified as the primary opposing position and addressed scripturally and theologically.
- **Sign and seal** - core sacramental categories: baptism signifies the covenant promise and seals it to the baptized; crucial for avoiding baptismal regeneration.
- **Sacrament** - visible, covenantal means of grace; necessary to define against both sacramentalism and purely symbolic reductionism.
- **Covenant of grace** - governing theological framework: baptism marks inclusion in the covenant community, paralleling circumcision.
- **Mode (sprinkling/pouring vs immersion)** - treated as adiaphora (non-essential); OPC practice historically prefers sprinkling/pouring but does not make mode salvific.
- **Baptismal regeneration** - explicitly denied; salvation depends on faith/Spirit, not the moment of baptismal water application.
- **Household baptism** - NT evidence used to justify infant baptism (e.g., Acts), invoked as proof of family inclusion in covenant signs.
- **Church membership (infant)** - baptism admits infants to covenant nurture and discipline; not equivalent to full communicant status.
- **Profession of faith / catechesis** - required antecedents to Lord's Supper and confirmed membership; baptism creates duty for instruction, not automatic admission to the Supper.
- **Westminster Standards / OPC polity** - confessional-linguistic anchors shaping interpretation and practice.
- **Efficacy (instrumental vs declarative)** - baptism is declarative/sealing rather than instrumental in producing regeneration.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for OPC practice and catechesis on baptism and membership.
 - As a **polemic** and teaching brief against credobaptist claims and baptismal-regeneration misunderstandings.
 - As an **exegetical-covenantal model**: used to read household passages and circumcision analogies in support of Reformed sacramental theology.
