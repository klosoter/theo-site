### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology - secondary treatment of Francis Turretin on anthropology (traducianism vs. creationism)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Primary historical figure: **Francis Turretin (1623-1687)**, Reformed scholastic at Geneva; principal work: Institutes of Elenctic Theology.
 - Modern secondary locus: essays in The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology survey historical Reformed positions on the soul and origin of human nature; Turretin is treated as a representative late-Scholastic Reformed voice.
 - Milieu: post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy wrestling with patristic, medieval, and Protestant sources; interaction with Aristotelian metaphysics and Protestant exegesis.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Core problem: **How are individual human souls originated, and how does original sin pass to posterity?** Turretin defends **creationism** of the soul (each soul immediately created by God) while also explaining the real propagation of sin and guilt to descendants.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Metaphysical defense: the soul is immaterial and simple; it cannot be generated by material seed, therefore it must be immediately created by God.
 - Scriptural exegesis: appeals to Genesis, Psalms, and Paul's anthropology; argues texts imply divine sourcing of life/soul.
 - Polemic vs traducianism: critiques Augustine/Lutheran lines that propagate the soul from parental souls on theological and philosophical grounds (e.g., identity, immateriality, individuation).
 - Account of original sin: distinguishes **creation of the soul** from **propagation of a corrupted human nature** - affirms seminal transmission (seminal/physical propagation of a depraved nature) and imputation of Adam's guilt under federal headship.
 - Pastoral and juridical considerations: preserves personal responsibility and the need for divine grace.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Augustine, medieval scholastics (Aquinas), contemporary Reformed (Calvin, contemporary Geneva), Lutheran defenders of traducianism, and Aristotelian/Scholastic metaphysics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (soul, body, composition)
 - Original sin (nature, guilt, transmission)
 - Providence/creation (immediate acts of God)
 - Soteriology indirectly (necessity of regeneration, imputation, covenant headship)

- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's theological center of gravity: **God as immediate Creator of each soul combined with a robust Reformed account of seminal transmission and federal imputation** - preserving divine sovereignty over origin while affirming inherited corruption and covenantal liability.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Precise metaphysical insistence on the soul's immaterial simplicity as decisive against traducianism.
 - Careful bifurcation between origin of the soul (creation) and origin/transmission of sin (seminal propagation plus imputation).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with Augustine and some Lutheran currents that favor traducianism; corrects what Turretin sees as their insufficient metaphysical account of immateriality.
 - Refines Calvinic ambiguity by giving a systematic metaphysical and juridical account rather than leaving the question largely open.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic pairing of **immediate creation** (anima creatio) with **seminal corruption** (propagation of a fallen nature) as a coherent two-tier solution.
 - Terminological clarity in distinguishing "origin" (origine) vs "transmission" (propagatio) of sin.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in later Reformed scholastic and confessional circles as a standard pro-creationist position.
 - Continues to shape contemporary Reformed treatments of anthropology and debates over soul origin; informs conservative confessional statements and pastoral theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating metaphysics, exegesis, and soteriology.
 - Useful pedagogically for demonstrating how to hold divine creation and real inherited corruption together without syncretism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Creationism (of the soul)** - each individual soul is immediately created by God at or before conception.
- **Traducianism** - the view that souls are transmitted from parents (usually via the soul of the parents); Turretin critiques this as metaphysically inadequate.
- **ImmateriaI simplicity** - the soul's lack of composition; central to the argument against generation of the soul by material seed.
- **Seminal propagation** - the propagation of a corrupted human nature from Adam to descendants (biological/seminal aspect of sin).
- **Federal headship (imputation)** - Adam as covenantal representative whose guilt is imputed to posterity; reconciles creationism with inherited guilt.
- **Original sin (nature vs guilt)** - Turretin distinguishes the corrupted nature (inherited) from the forensic imputation of Adam's guilt.
- **Immediate creation (anima creatio)** - God's direct act in producing each soul; emphasizes divine causality.
- **Propagation (propagatio)** - the biological transmission of human nature; used to explain how corrupted nature is passed on even if souls are created.
- **Metaphysical objections to traducianism** - arguments based on identity, immateriality, and non-compositeness of the soul.
- **Scriptural proofs** - exegeses of Genesis, Romans 5, Psalms used to support creationism and seminal corruption.
- **Pastoral implications** - maintains personal responsibility, necessity of regeneration, and coherence of covenantal pedagogy.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source for Reformed **anthropology** (clear statements on soul origin).
 - Polemic resource in debates **against traducianism** and in defense of metaphysical arguments for creationism.
 - Exegetical model for reading texts on human origin and original sin (Genesis, Romans 5) within a systematic framework.
