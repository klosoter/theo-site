### TITLE
**Karl Barth - The Epistle to the Romans (commentary), with emphasis on Romans 13**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Written 1918-1921 (first edition 1919; enlarged 1922); early Barthian work that launched dialectical/neo‑orthodox theology.
 - Reaction against 19th‑century liberal Protestantism (Ritschlian ethics, Schleiermacherian religiosity); formative in post‑war German theology.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Gospel is God's decisive, intrusive act in Christ which reorients Scripture, justification, election and human existence; human claims to autonomy (including political) are judged by God's revelation.
 - Romans 13 functions as a test case: how Christian allegiance to Christ orders submission to state authority without capitulating to worldly power.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close, verse‑by‑verse exposition rooted in the priority of the Word of God as event.
 - Major moves:
 - Exegesis of sin, law, and justification in Romans 1-8 as the backdrop for ethical exhortations.
 - Romans 9-11: theology of election and Israel; the paradox of God's faithfulness amid human unfaithfulness.
 - Romans 12-15: practical living grounded in eschatological reality; Romans 13: integration of political obedience, love of neighbor, and eschatological judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Polemically engages Ritschl, Schleiermacher, liberal Protestant ethics; converses with Luther (justification), Calvin (election), Augustine (sin), and contemporary exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word as event), Christology (Christ as sovereign Lord), Justification (by grace, through faith), Election (God's freedom and mercy), Eschatology (present and future dimensions), Ethics (neighbor love as Christ's command), Theology of the state (Romans 13).
- **Selected topical references**
 - **Delay of the Parousia:** Barth reframes eschatological delay as the tension between the already and not‑yet; the Parousia's promise judges worldly claims now rather than awaiting chronological fulfillment.
 - **Romans 11 and Israel's Future:** Barth reads Israel's place as a witness to God's inscrutable election and mercy; divine election suspends human presumption about national destiny.
 - **Christ and Culture (eschatological perspective):** In Romans 13 Barth subordinates culture and state to the lordship of Christ - culture is to be judged, reformed, and restrained by the eschatological summons of the Gospel.
- **Closing line**
 - Barth's Romans places the crucified and risen Christ at the center: the Word of God interrupts human systems (including political), grounding ethics and hope in God's sovereign, eschatological act.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of God's action (Word as event) over human religious experience or moralism.
 - Dialectical tensions held together: law/gospel, sin/grace, present/perfect eschatology.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal theology's anthropocentrism by restoring God's transcendence and initiative.
 - Rejects quietist readings of Romans 13 that sacralize the state; likewise resists anarchy by affirming limited divine institution of authority.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Reads Pauline texts through a Christocentric, evental hermeneutic rather than an ethical or merely historical lens.
 - Reinterprets election as revelatory of God's freedom and mercy, not as metaphysical predestination detached from God's reconciliation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed 20th‑century neo‑orthodoxy; decisive influence on post‑WWI theological renewal and on later political theology (shaping debates about church/state relations).
 - Criticized for abstraction, dense style, and alleged political quietism or ambivalence (debated among scholars).
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a corrective to anthropocentric readings of Scripture, a model for Christ‑centered exegesis, and a resource for theological ethics that resists both capitulation to power and utopian withdrawal.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word of God (Wort Gottes)**
 - The decisive event of God's self‑disclosure in Christ that judges and reorients human existence.
- **Justification**
 - God's verdict by grace through faith; the axis of Pauline theology for Barth's ethics.
- **Election**
 - God's free, merciful choice; read as a revelatory act rather than a deterministic scheme.
- **Antithesis**
 - The fundamental opposition between God's realm and human autonomy; Barth retains Pauline antithesis as theological method.
- **State / Political Authority (Romans 13)**
 - Instituted by God insofar as it restrains evil, but always subordinate to Christ and subject to critique by the Gospel.
- **Kingdom of God / Eschatology**
 - Present in Christ as judgment and promise; the Parousia's delay creates ethical tension, not theological uncertainty.
- **Israel and Election (Romans 11)**
 - Israel's fate exemplifies God's fidelity and the mystery of election; prevents triumphalistic assimilation of church and nation.
- **Neighbor / Love**
 - Ethical hermeneutic: love fulfills the law and circumscribes state obedience.
- **Law and Gospel**
 - Law exposes sin; Gospel proclaims liberation and forms Christian praxis.
- **Parousia / Delay of the Parousia**
 - Barth treats delay as existential tension: Christ's coming both accomplished in decisive event and awaited as final consummation.
- **Christ as Lord**
 - The determining criterion for all theology and ethics; cultural and political realities must answer to Christ's lordship.
- **Revelation as Encounter**
 - Revelation is not propositional information only but an encounter that summons obedience and judgment.
- **Sin / Human Autonomy**
 - Human attempts at self‑justification and cultural self‑sufficiency are named as rebellion against God's sovereignty.
- **Eschatological Judgment**
 - The present power of final judgment shapes ethical responsibility now.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: clarifies central Pauline concepts (justification, election) for systematic theology.
 - Polemic: a primary resource against liberal anthropocentrism and natural theology assumptions.
 - Exegetical model: paradigm for Christocentric, dialectical exegesis applied to ethical and political questions.
