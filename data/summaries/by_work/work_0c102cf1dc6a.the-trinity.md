### TITLE
**Karl Rahner, The Trinity** (Ger. 1967; Eng. 1970) - a modern Catholic retrieval of trinitarian dogma for soteriology, spirituality, and ecclesial life

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / context**
 - Late 20th c. Catholic theology after Vatican II; ressourcement plus transcendental Thomism.
 - Pushback against scholastic manualism that isolated Trinity from salvation and piety.
 - Ecumenical horizon; dialogue with Protestant dogmatics and patristic sources.
- **Central thesis / problem**
 - The God who reveals and gives himself in salvation history is none other than the eternal triune God.
 - The divine **missions** of Son and Spirit in the economy truly disclose the eternal **processions**; doctrine must be soteriologically integrated.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: a **practical unitarianism** in church life and theology; Trinity functionally marginal.
 - Method: begin from **revelation** (economy) toward ontological confession (immanent Trinity), not bypassing Scripture or dogma.
 - Doctrinal core:
 - **Processions and relations**: eternal generation and spiration as constituting the hypostases; persons as **subsistent relations**.
 - **Missions reveal processions**: Incarnation (Son) and Pentecost/indwelling (Spirit) as historical enactments of eternal origin.
 - **One God, one subject**: divine unity of essence and will; avoid tritheism by distinguishing person from modern notions of subjectivity.
 - **Inseparable operations** with real distinctions: all ad extra works are undivided, yet with fitting distinctions in the missions.
 - **Grace as God's self-communication**: the Spirit as uncreated grace; Christology as apex of self-gift; deification without confusion.
 - **Filioque** within Augustinian-Thomist frame: Spirit from the Father and the Son as one principle.
 - Praxis: liturgical and spiritual implications; the triune God grounds covenantal history and ecclesial sacramentality.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Fathers: **Augustine**, **Athanasius**; medievals: **Aquinas**; magisterial conciliar dogma (Nicaea, Constantinople, Lateran, Florence).
 - Moderns: engagement with **Barth** and idealist trajectories; critique of manualism and Hegelian historicizing.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation/Scripture** (economy as access to mystery); **Trinity proper**; **Christology** (Incarnation as mission); **Pneumatology** (indwelling Spirit); **Soteriology** (grace/deification); **Ecclesiology/sacrament**; covenantal economy as salvation history.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: God's **self-communication** in Word and Spirit within the covenantal economy truly manifests who God eternally is, without remainder or dilution of divine mystery.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The celebrated **Rahner's Rule**: the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa (rightly nuanced).
 - **Self-communication of God** as the integrating soteriological concept; grace is uncreated gift.
 - Recasting **person** in terms of **subsistent relations**, guarding unity by affirming effectively one divine subject.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against scholastic separation of Trinity from salvation and spirituality; against mere **appropriation** language that masks the missions.
 - Against **tritheism** (three centers of consciousness) and against **modalism** (mere roles); insists the economy reveals true eternal distinctions.
 - Resists **Hegelian** historicizing; preserves divine aseity and simplicity while rooting claims in revelation.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Tight linkage of **missions-processions**; insistence that the missions are not depictive fictions but real historical enactments of eternal origin.
 - Use of **one absolute subject** language to express unity, paired with relational distinction.
 - Deployment of the **supernatural existential** as backdrop: universal orientation to God's self-gift.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed the 20th c. trinitarian renewal across Catholic, Reformed, and ecumenical theology.
 - Widely mined in Reformed circles for hermeneutical guidance on economy-immanence and for pneumatology; criticized by some for near-modalist overtones or imprecise psychological language.
 - Shaped discussions on **inseparable operations**, **filioque**, and the integration of Trinity with soteriology and ecclesial life.
- **Enduring value**
 - A doctrinal and pedagogical bridge between classical dogma and covenantal-soteriological practice.
 - A durable rule-of-faith for correlating exegesis of salvation history with confession of God's eternal life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**: God as revealed and active in salvation history; the locus of revelation.
- **Immanent Trinity**: God's eternal triune life in se; the ground of the economy.
- **Rahner's Rule**: Hermeneutical identity of economy and immanence, with the caveat of non-collapse and divine freedom.
- **Missions (missio)**: Historical sendings/indwellings of Son and Spirit; revelatory of eternal origin.
- **Processions (processio)**: Eternal relations of origin (generation, spiration) constituting the hypostases.
- **Inseparable operations (opera ad extra)**: The three act undividedly externally; distinguished according to relations of origin.
- **Appropriation**: Fitting attribution of works to a person; Rahner cautions against using it to evade real trinitarian differentiation.
- **Subsistent relations**: Thomistic account of persons as relations that subsist; avoids modern subjectivist connotations.
- **Person/hypostasis vs subject**: One divine subject, three relational hypostases; unity without tritheism.
- **Self-communication of God**: Core soteriological claim; in grace and Incarnation God gives God's own self.
- **Uncreated grace**: The Holy Spirit as gift indwelling believers; basis of deification.
- **Filioque**: Spirit proceeding from Father and Son as one principle; Augustinian reading.
- **Supernatural existential**: Universal, graced orientation to God underpinning reception of revelation.
- **Consubstantiality and simplicity**: Unity of essence; relational distinction without composition.
- **Covenantal economy**: Salvation history as the field where God's triune self-gift unfolds.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - **Definition source** for economy-immanence relations and inseparable operations in Doctrine of the Trinity.
 - **Conceptual pivot** in **Pneumatology** (uncreated grace; mission of the Spirit).
 - **Framework** for reading salvation history in **Covenant Theology** and for integrating Trinity with **Soteriology**.
 - **Hermeneutical guide** in **Bibliology/Theology Proper** for moving from scriptural economy to ontological confession.
