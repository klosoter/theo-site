### TITLE
Causality: Models, Reasoning, and Inference - Judea Pearl (Princeton Univ. Press; 2000; 2nd ed. 2009)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Emerged at turn of 21st century from AI, statistics, and philosophy of science; reaction to limitations of purely associational statistics and the Neyman-Rubin tradition.
 - Part of broader movement toward graphical models, machine learning, and formal epistemology.

- **Central thesis**
 - Causation is formally representable and manipulable: a unified calculus (structural models + do-calculus + counterfactuals) lets us move from observation to intervention and to counterfactual inference in principled, testable ways.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Presents a three-level causal hierarchy:
 - **Association** (seeing; statistical correlations).
 - **Intervention** (doing; effects of actions, expressed by the do-operator).
 - **Counterfactuals** (imagining alternate outcomes; "what if" questions).
 - Introduces **Structural Causal Models (SCMs)**: causal graphs (DAGs) + structural equations encoding mechanisms.
 - Develops **graphical criteria** for identifiability:
 - **d-separation** for conditional independence.
 - **Back-door** and **front-door** criteria for adjusting for confounding.
 - Formalizes **do-calculus**: rules transforming expressions with interventions to ones estimable from data.
 - Extends to mediation, transportability, and policy evaluation; treats limits of inference (non-identifiability) and algorithmic solutions.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages implicitly with Humean skepticism about causation, Neyman-Rubin potential outcomes framework, and the graphical tradition (Spirtes-Glymour-Scheines).
 - Dialogues with statisticians, philosophers of science, and AI researchers rather than theologians.

- **Doctrines treated (theological analogues)**
 - Not theological in intent, but immediately relevant analogically to:
 - **Providence**: modeling divine/agent interventions vis-a-vis natural processes.
 - **Miracles**: evidential inferences about singular, purported interventions.
 - **Human agency & responsibility**: counterfactual accounts of moral causation.
 - **Historical inference**: causal claims about events (e.g., resurrection, conversion movements).
 - **Revelation/testimony**: distinguishing causal explanation from correlation in evidential chains.

- **Closing line**
 - Pearl furnishes a formal, operational toolkit that transforms vague talk of causes into testable, model-based claims-tools that, when applied carefully, sharpen theological and historical claims about agency, intervention, and providential explanation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates graphical, structural representation of mechanisms as primary; contrasts sharply with purely statistical correlationist views.
 - Makes **intervention** (the do-operator) the central primitive for causal claims.
 - Treats **counterfactuals** as derivable from structural models, not merely philosophical intuitions.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges the Neyman-Rubin approach by insisting on explicit causal structure rather than treating causation only via potential-outcome contrasts.
 - Corrects naive uses of regression/association in inference; shows how Simpson-type paradoxes require causal graphs for resolution.
 - Opposes Humean reduction of causation to regular succession: provides formal machinery for "manipulable" causation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Structural Causal Models (SCMs), do-operator, do-calculus, front-door criterion, d-separation, formal account of identifiability.

- **Reception & influence in theology**
 - Limited direct uptake in confessional theology but growing use in:
 - Analytic theology and philosophy of religion (modelling agency, miracles).
 - Historical theology methodology (causal inference for events).
 - Ethics and pastoral studies (cause-effect links in behavior change).
 - Some theological caution: metaphysical assumptions (mechanistic models, interventionist ontology) may not map neatly onto doctrines of divine action or providence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Forces clarity about what counts as evidence for causal claims.
 - Supplies rigorous tools for historical and empirical theology.
 - Provokes productive conversation about modeling divine agency, providential chains, and the limits of scientific inference in theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Structural Causal Model (SCM)** - Graph + structural equations representing mechanisms; basis for counterfactuals.
- **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** - Visual syntax for causal assumptions; nodes = variables, arrows = direct causal influences.
- **do-operator (do(X=x))** - Formal expression of intervention; distinguishes observation from manipulation.
- **Counterfactual** - Statements about what would have occurred under alternative interventions; derived from SCMs.
- **d-separation** - Graphical test for conditional independence; used to read off implications of causal models.
- **Back-door criterion** - Graphical condition identifying sets that control for confounding to estimate causal effect.
- **Front-door criterion** - Alternative identifiability condition using mediators when back-door adjustment is impossible.
- **Identifiability** - Whether a causal quantity can be expressed in terms of observed data and assumptions.
- **do-calculus** - Three transformation rules enabling derivation of interventional distributions from observational ones.
- **Confounder** - Common cause producing spurious association; central target for adjustment.
- **Mediation** - Decomposition of causal effects into direct and indirect (via mediator) components.
- **Simpson's paradox** - Illustrative paradox resolved by causal graphs showing aggregation biases.
- **Potential outcomes (Rubin)** - Comparative framework often contrasted with SCMs; Pearl shows formal relations.
- **Transportability** - Conditions under which causal conclusions transfer between settings.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for precise, operational accounts of causation in analytic theology and philosophy of religion.
 - As a **methodological model** for historical theology and apologetics when assessing evidence for singular events (miracles, resurrection narratives).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** or polemical tool against naive correlational reasoning in pastoral studies, ethics, and social-scientific theology.
