### TITLE
**The Biblical Covenants as the Foundation for Biblical Theology** (SBJT 2012) - Peter J. Gentry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Published in Southern Baptist Journal of Theology (2012). Situated in early 21st-century evangelical/Reformed debates over canonical, redemptive-historical, and covenantal readings of Scripture. Builds on renewed interest in covenant theology in evangelical seminaries and churches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - The biblical covenants provide the indispensable macro-structure for doing biblical theology: they order revelation, define the kingdom, and orient ethics toward consummation in Christ. Properly understood, covenant theology (in a broadly Klinean/redemptive-historical register) resolves disjunctions between Testaments and supplies a normative hermeneutic.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Sketches the major covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) as progressive stages of one covenantal economy. 
 - Argues for **Christ as the center**: each covenant finds its telos and fulfillment in Christ (typology and promise-fulfillment). 
 - Deploys a canonical, redemptive-historical method rather than isolated text-by-text moralism or synoptic systematic abstractions. 
 - Applies covenantal structure to ethics via the notion of covenantal "intrusion" - God initiating kingdom presence that demands covenantal response (links to Klinean intrusion ethics). 
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Dialogues with Meredith Kline (notably Klinean covenant schema and intrusion language), classical Reformed covenant theologians (e.g., Westminster tradition), and opponents such as dispensationalists who separate Israel and Church. Also engages recent biblical-theological voices promoting canonical approaches.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Revelation (progressive/canonical), covenant (unity and diversity), Christology (fulfillment and headship), kingdom (already/not-yet), soteriology (covenantal promise and fulfillment), ethics (covenantal response/intrusion ethic), typology, ecclesiology (church as covenant community).
- **Closing line:** 
 - Covenants are not optional thematic motifs but the structural skeleton of biblical theology: they order revelation, shape Christ-centered interpretation, and ground a covenantal ethic of kingdom intrusion and consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Emphasizes covenantal structure as the primary organizing principle of Scripture rather than mere thematic or moral continuities. Stresses **intrusion ethics**: God's covenantal in-breaking (intrusion) creates an ethic of response rooted in covenant identity and eschatological expectation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Counters dispensational bifurcation of Israel and Church by highlighting covenantal continuity and typological fulfillment. Moderates older Reformed schemas by insisting on canonical-historical concreteness (not abstract, ahistorical covenant systems).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Adopts and operationalizes **Klinean** categories (intrusion, covenantal court/administration) within a canonical biblical theology; moves intrusion language from primarily legal-constitutional rhetoric into practical ethical application.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Influential in evangelical and Reformed academic circles and seminaries; used to teach covenantal biblical theology and to rebut dispensational readings. Cited in courses and works emphasizing Christ-centered canonical approaches.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Provides a compact, pedagogically useful synthesis linking covenantal macro-structure to hermeneutics, Christology, and ethics; useful for students, preachers, and systematicians seeking an integrated biblical-theological framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical covenants:** The major historical covenants (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New) as progressive, interlocking stages of divine purpose. 
- **Covenantal framework:** The hermeneutical lens that organizes Scripture's narrative and theology around covenantal promises and obligations. 
- **Redemptive-historical (canonical) method:** Reading texts in their place within the unfolding covenantal story rather than as isolated moral propositions. 
- **Christocentric fulfillment:** The claim that all covenant promises find their telos and concrete fulfillment in the person and work of Christ. 
- **Klinean covenant theology:** Meredith Kline's influence visible in legal-constitutional metaphors, the notion of divine intrusion, and stress on covenant administration. 
 - Related: **Intrusion ethics** - ethics derived from God's covenantal in-breaking that demands a covenantal human response and participation in kingdom life.
- **Typology:** Covenantal foreshadowing and correspondence where earlier persons/events are instituted as types fulfilled in Christ. 
- **Kingdom (already/not-yet):** Covenant as the vehicle of God's kingdom presence now and consummation later; ethics shaped by both present intrusion and future consummation. 
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** Classical categories reframed within a canonical history that emphasizes redemptive continuity and Christ as covenant head. 
- **Progressive revelation:** The idea that covenantal disclosure unfolds historically and climactically in Christ. 
- **Covenantal nomism (contrast):** Not legalism; covenantal law defines identity and life within God's covenant community, grounded in grace. 
- **Ecclesial-covenantal identity:** Church as the covenant community continuing and witnessing covenant promises.
- **Typological-historical continuity vs discontinuity:** Framework for resolving how Old Testament institutions relate to New Testament fulfilment.
- **Use across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source**: supplies clear definition of covenants and their theological function. 
 - As a **polemic**: employed against dispensational separations and de-historicized moral readings. 
 - As an **exegetical model**: guides preaching and biblical-theological exegesis by mapping texts into covenantal stages. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses to integrate biblical theology with doctrinal loci (soteriology, Christology, ethics).
