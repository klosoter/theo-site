### TITLE
**The Church of Christ: A Treatise on the Nature, Powers, Ordinances, Discipline, and Government of the Christian Church** - James Bannerman (Scottish Presbyterian; mid-19th century, first edition 1868)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-Victorian Scottish Reformed context; written against rising Romanizing tendencies, Erastianism, and vague voluntarism.
 - Bannerman writes as a Free Church theologian seeking to defend a historically informed, doctrinally Reformed ecclesiology for Presbyterianism.

- **Central thesis**
 - The true Church of Christ is a divinely constituted society identified by essential marks (Word, sacraments, and discipline), rightly governed by offices and courts ordained in Scripture, and ordered for the extension of Christ's kingdom in covenant continuity with the apostolic church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic, multipart treatment moving from definition and nature of the church to its marks, powers, ordinances, government, and discipline.
 - exegesis and biblical theology of the church (scripture as normative).
 - historical-theological survey (Patristic, medieval, Reformation, modern).
 - doctrinal synthesis defending Reformed marks and Presbyterian polity.
 - Emphasizes both the **invisible** (elect body) and **visible** church realities and their interrelation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy use of Scripture, Reformed confessions, classical Patristic authors, medieval canon law (critically), and contemporary Anglican and Roman Catholic writers; engaged with Erastian and high-church opponents.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (nature, marks, catholicity, apostolicity), covenant theology, sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper), ministry and ordination, church discipline, relationship of church and state, and the church's powers.

- **Site usage references**
 - Treatment of universal identity and catholicity of the church (see section on **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church**).
 - Detailed exegesis of identifying criteria and signs (see **Nature And Marks Of The Church**).
 - Comprehensive argument for Presbyterian organization, offices, and discipline (see **Church Government Presbyterian Polity Offices Discipline**).

- **Closing line**
 - Bannerman's theological center of gravity: the Church of Christ is a historically rooted, biblically governed communion whose authenticity is measured by faithful preaching of the Word, proper administration of the sacraments, and the exercise of Christian discipline under rightly ordered government.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced retrieval of both visible and invisible dimensions without reducing the church to either pure spiritualism or mere institutionalism.
 - Strong insistence that **discipline** is a constitutive mark, not an optional extra; ecclesial identity is ecclesiastical and practical, not merely confessional.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges Roman Catholic claims of institutional exclusivity and apostolic succession as sufficient proof of the true church.
 - Opposes Erastian subordination of church courts to civil tribunals; defends ecclesiastical independence within proper civil order.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Nuanced use of "subsistence" language before it became common: locates the Church of Christ in communities that retain the marks, while distinguishing fullness from mere historical continuity.
 - Precise tripartite "marks" structure (Word, Sacraments, Discipline) re-articulated with historical and pastoral concreteness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded as a classic in Reformed ecclesiology; widely used in Scottish and later Anglo-Reformed circles as the standard systematic defense of Presbyterian polity.
 - Influenced discussions on church-state relations, the nature of catholicity, and practical theology of discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - Remains an essential resource for teaching ecclesiology, defending confessional Presbyterianism, and recovering a doctrine of discipline that is both biblical and historically conscious.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church of Christ** - the whole people of God constituted under Christ's headship; both visible and invisible aspects emphasized.
- **Visible Church** - communities and institutions where the Word is preached, sacraments rightly administered, and discipline exercised (cf. Nature And Marks Of The Church).
- **Invisible Church** - the elect known to God alone; Bannerman balances this with the visible reality.
- **Marks of the Church** - **Word**, **Sacraments**, **Discipline**; the canonical test for identifying authentic churches (see Nature And Marks Of The Church).
 - Word: faithful preaching and administration of doctrine.
 - Sacraments: rightly administered baptism and Lord's Supper.
 - Discipline: corrective and restorative ecclesiastical practice.
- **Catholicity (One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church)** - unity of the church across time and space grounded in apostolic faith, not institutional homogeneity.
- **Apostolicity** - fidelity to apostolic doctrine and order; historical continuity with the apostolic witness.
- **Government / Polity** - Presbyterian system of elders and courts; authority exercised collegially and representatively (see Church Government Presbyterian Polity Offices Discipline).
- **Offices** - distinction and duties of pastor/teaching elder, ruling elder, and deacon; ordination as a public act within courts.
- **Discipline** - remedial and judicial processes that preserve purity, faith, and worship; essential to church identity.
- **Ordination** - rite conferring office; ecclesiastical, not civil, authority is determinant.
- **Covenant** - theological framework for church membership and sacraments.
- **Subscription / Confessionalism** - proper relation of ministers and sessions to creeds and confessions in governing unity.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for Reformed marks of the church and the doctrine of catholicity.
 - As a **polemic** tool against Roman claims and Erastian interference.
 - As an **exegetical and practical model** for teaching Presbyterian polity, ordination, and the theology of discipline.
