### TITLE
**Pentecostal Worship: A Reformed Critique** - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century engagement between conservative Reformed theology and rising charismatic/Pentecostal renewal.
 - Written from a confessional Reformed vantage; shaped by Frame's broader project of applying his triperspectival method to practical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Pentecostal worship places excessive epistemic and regulative weight on immediate spiritual experience and charismatic manifestations, undermining the Reformed convictions about the authority of Scripture, the regulative principle of worship, and ordered corporate worship.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnose: identify characteristic Pentecostal emphases - spontaneity, emotional intensity, visible manifestations (tongues, prophecy, healings), and an experiential test for authenticity.
 - Normative standard: articulate a Reformed account of worship grounded in Scripture, covenant theology, and the regulative principle (worship must be ordained by God's Word).
 - Methodological correction: apply triperspectival categories (normative, situational, existential) to show how experience must be subordinated to normative revelation and fitted to situational contexts under ecclesial order.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial proposals: urge discernment, ordered practice, confessional controls, and careful testing of alleged charismatic gifts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Pentecostal/charismatic praxis and representative claims rather than a single systematic opponent; dialogue implicitly with popular charismatic leaders and with Pentecostal theology of experience.
 - Draws on Reformed confessions, biblical exegesis, and Frame's own systematic method.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation and authority of Scripture** (priority and test for worship).
 - **Pneumatology** (nature and operation of the Spirit in corporate worship; gifts).
 - **Ecclesiology and worship** (order, sacraments/ordinances, corporate norms).
 - **Soteriology and Christology** insofar as worship must be Christ-centered.
- **Closing line**
 - A Reformed corrective that insists worship be governed first by God's Word and covenantal order, with the Spirit's manifestations judged and shaped by Scripture rather than allowed to redefine liturgical norms.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Systematic use of Frame's **triperspectival method** to evaluate worship: the Spirit's activity (existential) must be interpreted by Scripture (normative) and shaped by context (situational) within ordered ecclesial practice.
 - Strong advocacy for the **regulative principle** as a safeguard against subjectivist worship innovations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Unlike uncritical charismatic apologia, Frame neither anathematizes spiritual gifts nor accepts their unchecked dominance; he calls for **discernment and normative testing**.
 - Contrasts with some historic Reformed overreactions by acknowledging legitimate role of emotion and Spirit-led spontaneity - but only as subordinate to the Word.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Application of triperspectival categories specifically to liturgical critique - turning a philosophical-theological method into a practical evaluative tool for worship.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within conservative Reformed circles as a measured, intellectually rigorous critique of Pentecostal worship practices.
 - Served as a prompt for further Reformed engagement with charismatic movements; less influence within Pentecostal scholarship except as a representative Reformed objection.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced model for critiquing worship movements: neither dismissive nor naively accommodating, useful for pastors, seminary courses, and ecumenical conversations on worship and the Spirit.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regulative principle of worship** - worship elements must be warranted by Scripture; Frame defends this as primary corrective.
- **Triperspectivalism (normative/situational/existential)** - Frame's methodological frame applied to assess worship claims.
 - **Normative**: Scripture and confessional norms that govern worship.
 - **Situational**: cultural/contextual considerations for appropriate forms.
 - **Existential**: personal and corporate experience, including emotional and charismatic phenomena.
- **Pneumatology** - role and limits of the Holy Spirit in corporate worship; gifts tested by Word.
- **Continuationism vs. cessationism** - theological background to debates about present-day charismatic gifts; Frame tends to insist on caution and testing rather than facile claims.
- **Experientialism** - prioritizing felt experience as norm; critiqued as epistemologically risky.
- **Spontaneity** - praised in principle but warned against when it undermines order and Scriptural rule.
- **Discernment/testing of spirits** - ecclesial procedures and biblical criteria for evaluating claimed prophecies and tongues.
- **Covenantal worship** - worship framed by covenant promises and sacraments; emphasizes Christ-centered rites.
- **Ecclesial order** - structured leadership, liturgy, and sacrament administration as protective of orthodoxy.
- **Word-centered worship** - preaching and Scripture as central acts; experiential manifestations subordinate.
- **Sacraments/ordinances** - treated as normative, covenantal signs not to be eclipsed by charismatic displays.
- **Authority of Scripture** - ultimate arbiter for worship practice and claims of the Spirit.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a Reformed critique of Pentecostal worship practices.
- As a **polemic** to caution churches and seminarians against uncritical experientialism.
- As an **exegetical-method model**, demonstrating application of triperspectivalism to worship theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in curricular settings for integrating pneumatology, ecclesiology, and liturgics.
