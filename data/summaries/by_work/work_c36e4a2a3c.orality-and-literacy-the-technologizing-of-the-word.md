### TITLE
Orality and Literacy: The Technologizing of the Word - Walter J. Ong (1982)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1982 amid growth in media studies, cognitive anthropology, and literacy studies.
 - Dialogues with scholars like Eric Havelock, Jack Goody, Walter Benjamin, Marshall McLuhan, and the Parry-Lord oral-formulaic school.
 - Ong, a Jesuit scholar, writes from an interdisciplinary humanistic perspective bridging philology, rhetoric, and cultural history.

- **Central thesis**
 - The shift from oral to literate cultures is not merely technological but transforms cognition, social organization, memory, and ways the Word (speech, scripture, doctrine) functions. New electronic media create a "secondary orality" that reconfigures those effects.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define forms of orality:
 - **Primary orality**: cultures with no knowledge of writing; thought shaped by sound, memory, performance, situational context.
 - **Residual orality**: survivals of oral traits in literate contexts.
 - **Secondary orality**: oral-like phenomena produced by electronic technologies but dependent on literacy.
 - Contrastive analysis of orality vs literacy:
 - Oral cultures: additive rather than analytic, aggregative, redundant, agonistic, situational, and mnemonic.
 - Literate cultures: analytic, sequential, abstract, interiorized consciousness, visualized thinking, facilitation of conceptual differentiation.
 - Trace historical consequences: alphabetic literacy reorders thought, produces detached individual consciousness, fosters abstract argumentation, and enables complex institutional memory (e.g., scriptural canons, law).
 - Assess modern media: electronic communication revives oral features (participatory, communal), but as an overlay upon literate structures (not a simple return).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Havelock and Goody on literacy's consequences, Parry-Lord on oral composition, McLuhan on media effects; indirectly converses with Plato, Augustine, and modern linguistics/anthropology.

- **Doctrines addressed (implications rather than systematic treatments)**
 - Revelation and Scripture: medium influences perceived authority, fixity, and interpretive practices.
 - Tradition and Church memory: oral transmission dynamics vs textual canonization.
 - Preaching, liturgy, and sacramentality: performance, communal presence, and mnemonic forms reshaped by media.
 - Hermeneutics and ecclesial epistemology: how bodily, auditory, and visual media affect belief formation.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The medium by which the Word is carried fundamentally shapes how a community remembers, understands, and authorizes revelation; technology is thus co-determining for theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on the *psychodynamics* of communication: how medium structures consciousness, memory, and social relations.
 - Distinction between primary and secondary orality to avoid teleological narratives of "return" to preliteracy.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - More nuanced than simple "literacy equals progress" models (e.g., Goody) and more historical/anthropological than McLuhan's aphoristic claims.
 - Counters both technological determinism and technological neutrality by showing mediated reciprocity: word shapes medium and medium shapes word.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Technologizing of the word" as a phrase: the idea that words acquire new properties when anchored to technologies (writing, print, electronic).
 - Systematic typology: primary/oral, residual, secondary orality as analytic tools used across disciplines.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in homiletics, liturgy, missiology, biblical studies (oral tradition research), and media theology.
 - Used by theologians to critique print-centered ecclesial authority and to rethink preaching and catechesis in media-saturated contexts.
 - Criticisms: occasional overgeneralization about cognitive uniformity of "oral" peoples; debates over historical specificity and empirical support.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust framework for assessing how media change religious authority, communal memory, and scriptural reception.
 - Useful heuristic for contemporary questions about digital media, performance theology, and oral-based mission.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Primary orality**
 - Culture with no knowledge of writing; features include formulaic composition, memory reliance, situational speech.

- **Residual orality**
 - Oral traits persisting within literate cultures (e.g., oral storytelling, communal speech habits).

- **Secondary orality**
 - Oral-like communication produced by electronic media (broadcast, radio, TV, digital) that presupposes literacy.

- **Technologizing of the word**
 - Core phrase: technologies (writing, print, electronic media) change the properties and social effects of verbal communication.

- **Additive vs analytic thought**
 - Oral thought tends to be additive, repetitive, redundant; literate thought tends to be analytic, abstract, sequential.

- **Mnemotechnics**
 - Techniques of memory shaped by oral practices; contrasted with external storage (texts, records) enabled by literacy.

- **Acoustic vs visual space**
 - Acoustic (oral) space is participatory, communal, multisensory; visual/graphic space fosters detachment, individuation, linearity.

- **Oral-formulaic composition**
 - Mode of composition in oral traditions (tying Ong to Parry-Lord scholarship); relevant for interpreting biblical genres.

- **Authority and fixity**
 - How writing creates fixed, archiveable texts altering ecclesial authority and canon formation.

- **Contextualization**
 - The role of situational anchors in oral cultures vs context-independent abstraction in literate cultures.

- **Phonocentrism / privileging speech**
 - Discussion of cultural tendencies to privilege speech as primary; Ong problematizes simplistic privileging by historicizing both forms.

- Use across loci:
 - **Definition source**: standard terminology for studies of orality, literacy, and media theology.
 - **Exegetical model**: frames NT and OT studies that consider oral backgrounds, performance, and memory.
 - **Conceptual pivot**: employed in homiletics, liturgy, and mission to rethink pedagogy and authority in media contexts.
 - **Polemic/resource**: used both to criticize print-centric ecclesial practices and to resource new media engagement strategies.
