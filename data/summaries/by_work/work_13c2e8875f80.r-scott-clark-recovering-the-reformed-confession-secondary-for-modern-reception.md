### TITLE
R. Scott Clark, Recovering the Reformed Confession (secondary study of Francis Turretin) - focused reading on the Law-Gospel distinction and its confessional reception

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary recovery movement (late 20th-21st c.) within conservative Reformed Presbyterianism; Clark argues for retrieving Protestant scholasticism and confessional subscription as ecclesial practice.
 - Primary historical interlocutor: Francis Turretin (17th c., Geneva/Academy of Geneva), author of the Institutes of Elenctic Theology; Clark treats Turretin as representative of classical Reformed scholastic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Reclaim the classical Reformed/confessional articulation of law and gospel - especially Turretin's nuanced balance - against modern distortions (antinomian slackness, pietistic or revivalist flattening, and caricatures that scholasticism corrupted Calvin).
- **Core argument / structure (major moves)**
 - Diagnostic: modern Reformed churches have drifted from confessional method and precise loci-theology.
 - Retrieval: Turretin's method and formulations preserve Calvin's theology in a usable, disciplined scholastic idiom.
 - Application: law and gospel must be read through covenantal categories and the threefold use of the law to secure both justification and practical holiness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Francis Turretin; secondary sources include Calvin and the Westminster Divines by implication; Clark also contrasts modern figures who collapse or over-sharpen law/gospel (pietists, some revivalist and some modern exegetes).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority and confessional subscription), covenant theology (covenant of works/grace), law (moral law), soteriology (justification by faith), sanctification (third use of law), pastoral application.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: a confessional, covenantal Reformedism that preserves a disciplined law-gospel relation via Turretinian scholastic precision - law convicts and guides; gospel justifies and secures sanctification within the covenant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Recuperation of Turretin's scholastic method as serviceable and faithful to Reformation principles rather than a degenerate afterlife of Calvin.
 - Stress on covenantal coordination: law's functions are interpreted within covenantal economy rather than as a merely ethical code or a foil to gospel rhetoric.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against both antinomian tendencies (which downplay the normative role of the law for believers) and over-zealous law/gospel segregation (which can make the law irrelevant to Christian sanctification).
 - Challenges caricatures that scholasticism effaced the gospel; instead presents scholastic precision as a safeguard for orthodox law/gospel balance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not novel lexical coinages, but a reapplication: Clark reframes Turretin's categories (threefold use of law, covenantal structures) for modern confessional practice and catechesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among confessional Reformed and Presbyterian circles seeking theological recovery and catechetical clarity.
 - Cited in debates on confessional subscription, pastoral formation, and liturgical/theological recovery of covenantal preaching.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact model for integrating doctrine and practice: clarifies law/gospel relations for preaching, catechesis, and pastoral oversight while anchoring discussion in confessional historical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Law-Gospel Distinction**
 - Reformed reading: complementary functions, not absolute opposites; law condemns and guides, gospel redeems and empowers.
- **Threefold Use of the Law**
 - **Civil (usus politicus/civilis):** restrains sin in society.
 - **Pedagogical/convicting (usus elenchticus):** reveals sin and drives to Christ.
 - **Normative/third use (usus normativus):** guides Christian obedience and sanctification.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - Pre-fall covenant framing of law's requirement; law as covenantal demand prior to Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The redemptive covenant in which gospel promises are applied; law's moral requirements remain but are fulfilled in Christ and applied by the Spirit.
- **Justification by Faith**
 - Central gospel doctrine; Clark/Turretin insist law never justifies but must be harmonized with gospel assurance.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive conformity to Christ; sustained by gospel assurance and governed by the law's third use.
- **Scholastic Method**
 - Distinctive argumentative precision (thesis, objections, responses); used by Turretin and recovered by Clark as a theological pedagogy.
- **Confessionalism / Subscription**
 - Ecclesial practice of subscription to confessions as a theological boundary marker and formative rule.
- **Antithesis (Law-Grace antithesis)**
 - The Reformation insight of contrast between covenantal conditions and covenantal promises; moderated by Turretin to avoid dialectical extremism.
- **Redemptive-historical framing**
 - Covenantal reading that keeps law/gospel in their chronological and soteriological places.
- **Pedagogy and Catechesis**
 - Practical outworking: use of Turretinian clarity in training ministers and laity on law/gospel distinctions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed teaching on the threefold use of the law and law-gospel relations.
 - As a **polemic** against antinomian and reductionist accounts of law or gospel in contemporary churches.
 - As an **exegetical-pastoral model** for preaching and catechesis that maintains doctrinal clarity while pressing for sanctified life.
