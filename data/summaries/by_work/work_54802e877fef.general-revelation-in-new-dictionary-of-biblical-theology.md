### TITLE
General Revelation - Henri Blocher, entry in New Dictionary of Biblical Theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical biblical theology. Blocher writes from a Reformed, continental-French background engaged with both classical Protestant theology and modern critiques (notably Barthian and Enlightenment skepticism).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - General revelation (God disclosed in creation and conscience) reliably testifies to God's existence and attributes but is intrinsically limited by sin and cannot substitute for saving, redemptive knowledge given in special revelation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: treats key biblical loci (Psalm 19; Romans 1-2; Acts 14, 17; Job; Hebrews) to establish the Bible's picture of creation and conscience as revelation.
 - Epistemic claim: general revelation yields genuine but analogical knowledge of God (we know God truly but inadequately).
 - Theological qualification: human sin corrupts reception (noetic effects) so that general revelation condemns as well as restrains and provides a point of contact for the gospel.
 - Delimitation: contrasts the revelatory function of nature with the redemptive, propositional, and Christ-centered content only available in special revelation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Biblical authors and texts; historical theologians such as Augustine, Aquinas, and Calvin (sensus divinitatis); modern interlocutors include Karl Barth (critical of natural theology), Enlightenment skeptics, and contemporary philosophers of religion.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), epistemology of theological knowledge, anthropology and sin (noetic effects), common grace, natural theology, accountability, and the gospel's presuppositions.
- **Closing line**
 - General revelation is a true, analogical, and providential witness to God that both grounds human accountability and prepares (but does not replace) the need for the definitive, saving disclosure in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced biblical-theological middle ground**
 - Rejects both naive natural theology (that creation suffices for saving knowledge) and radical Barthian denial of any natural knowledge of God; emphasizes biblical texts that affirm creation's revelatory role while recognizing human perversity.
- **Analogical epistemology**
 - Stresses that knowledge from nature is analogical: real and truthful but finite and creaturely, avoiding both full univocity and total equivocity about God.
- **Pastoral-theological nuance**
 - Highlights the twin functions of general revelation: deterrence/condemnation (revealing sin) and a providential bridge for mission and apologetic engagement.
- **Critique of simplistic models**
 - Corrects older formulations that overstate natural theology's capacity to produce saving faith; likewise critiques strict anti-natural-theology positions for undermining biblical witness in Romans and Psalms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical circles for careful exegesis and for practical use in apologetics and preaching; used as a corrective to both secular reductionism and theological fideism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a close integration of exegesis, historical theology, and theological epistemology that serves teachers and students seeking a sober account of what creation can and cannot disclose about God.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **General revelation**
 - God's self-disclosure through creation (cosmos) and conscience; public, universal, and non-redemptive.
- **Special revelation**
 - God's saving self-disclosure in Scripture and Christ; propositional and decisive for salvation.
- **Natural theology**
 - Philosophical/theological inferences from general revelation; useful but limited and always subordinate to special revelation.
- **Sensus divinitatis (Calvin)**
 - Innate capacity or orientation toward God; Blocher treats it as consistent with biblical testimony but subject to corruption by sin.
- **Noetic effects of sin**
 - Intellectual and perceptual distortion caused by fallenness that impedes right reception of general revelation (grounded in Romans 1).
- **Analogical knowledge**
 - Theological epistemic model: creaturely knowledge that legitimately reflects God but is always partial and analogical.
- **Common grace**
 - Providential restraint and enabling that preserves revelation's witness and allows moral and scientific knowledge despite the fall.
- **Accountability**
 - Biblical consequence: general revelation renders humanity responsible before God (judicial/ethical implications in Romans).
- **Witness / pointer function**
 - Creation and conscience act as a "pointer" to God, preparing for but not achieving saving faith.
- **Teleology / design motifs**
 - Nature displays order and purposiveness that testify to divine wisdom and power (used cautiously as evidential support).
- **Biblical loci (Ps 19; Rom 1-2; Acts 14, 17)**
 - Primary texts Blocher reads to ground the doctrine; used to show both revelation and resistance in human hearts.
- **Revelatory adequacy**
 - A term to mark the boundary between what general revelation can truly establish (existence, some attributes) and what it cannot (atoning Christ, covenant promises).

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a biblically rooted, nuanced doctrine of general revelation.
- As a **polemic resource** against extreme Barthian denial and against overconfident natural theology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans and Psalms on revelation, conscience, and accountability.
