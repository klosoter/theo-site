### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical theology; written within a broadly conservative Presbyterian/P&R milieu.
 - Sits at the intersection of systematic theology and epistemology during a period of renewed interest in Reformed apologetics (presuppositional and Reformed epistemology).
 - Relates to Frame's wider project of integrating theological loci and practical Christian living.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Knowledge of God is fundamentally **personal, covenantal, and theological** rather than a mere set of propositions or abstract metaphysical facts.
 - Epistemology must be governed by theology: how we know is shaped by who God is and how he reveals himself.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Begins by defining what "knowing God" means in biblical and theological categories (personal acquaintance + propositional truth).
 - Distinguishes and relates **general revelation** (God as creator-known in nature/conscience) and **special revelation** (Scripture and Christ) as sources of knowledge.
 - Argues for the priority of **God's self-revelation** and the authority of Scripture as the normative rule for theology and knowledge.
 - Develops an apologetic posture: critiques autonomy of human reason/evidentialism and defends a theocentric presuppositional stance.
 - Emphasizes the moral/volitional dimension of knowledge: genuine knowledge of God issues in trust and obedience.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Reformed tradition broadly; dialogues with **Cornelius Van Til** (presuppositionalism) and with contemporary epistemologists such as **Alvin Plantinga** (Reformed epistemology).
 - Interacts with classical apologetic positions and evidentialist interlocutors; uses biblical exegesis and historical theology (Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed thinkers) as resources.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general and special), Scripture (authority/inerrancy), knowledge/epistemology, covenantal theology, the doctrine of God (as knower), faith and obedience, apologetics, and implications for ethics and worship.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **true knowledge of God is God-centered revelation received in faith and obedience; epistemology is subordinate to and informed by the doctrine of God.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of epistemology with systematic theology: knowledge of God is treated primarily as a theological (not merely philosophical) category.
 - Emphasis on the **personal-covenantal** character of knowing God-knowledge as relational rather than merely propositional.
 - Prioritizes Scripture as the normative rule for knowing God while allowing a role for general revelation under God's sovereign self-disclosure.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Critiques classical evidentialism and any privatized autonomy of human reason; challenges attempts to make natural theology the primary route to God.
 - Modifies pure Van Tillian prescriptions by insisting on clarity about Scripture's normative role and careful distinctions between propositional and personal knowledge.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies vocabulary around "knowledge" by combining **personal acquaintance**, **propositional truth**, and **covenantal trust** in a unified account.
 - Frames apologetics in theological terms: epistemic questions are ultimately theological questions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical academic circles; frequently used in seminary classrooms on epistemology and theology.
 - Informed later Frame projects (including tri-perspectival emphases) and served as a touchstone in debates between presuppositionalists, Reformed epistemologists, and evidentialists.
 - Criticized by some analytic philosophers for insufficient engagement with technical epistemology; praised by pastors and theologians for pastoral seriousness and theological clarity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for linking doctrine of God to epistemology, teaching the primacy of revelation, and training pastors/apologists to view knowing as worshipful obedience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Knowledge of God**
 - A composite: personal relational knowledge + propositional truth + covenantal trust/obedience.
- **Revelation**
 - General (natural) and special (Scripture/Christ) as complementary sources; special revelation normative.
- **Special Revelation**
 - Scripture and Christ as decisive for true knowledge; Scripture functions as the normative rule for theology.
- **General Revelation**
 - Accessible in creation and conscience but unable to bring saving knowledge apart from God's redemptive self-disclosure.
- **Covenantal Knowledge**
 - Knowledge shaped and sustained within the covenant relationship between God and his people.
- **Presuppositional Apologetics**
 - Epistemic approach that locates starting points in theological commitments rather than neutral rational foundations.
- **Theocentric Epistemology**
 - Epistemology centered on God as knower and revealer; theological prior to philosophical.
- **Propositional vs. Personal Knowledge**
 - Frame insists on holding both: true propositions about God and personal fellowship/trust in God.
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as normative rule; governs interpretation, apologetics, and epistemic claims.
- **Faith-Obedience Nexus**
 - Knowledge and obedience are inseparable; intellectual assent without trust/obedience is incomplete knowing.
- **Analogy of Faith (over Analogy of Being)**
 - Interpreting God through God's self-revelation (Scripture/Christ) rather than unaided metaphysical analogies.
- **Critique of Evidentialism**
 - Challenges the view that detached evidence is the primary route to knowledge of God.
- **Role of Reason**
 - Reason is a God-given faculty but must be oriented by revelation and submission to divine truth.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed conceptions of knowledge of God (useful in systematic theology and epistemology chapters).
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist and purely natural-theological approaches in apologetics texts.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Scripture's teaching on knowing God (bridging biblical theology and doctrinal construction).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in seminars and curricula linking doctrine of God, epistemology, ethics, and pastoral theology.
