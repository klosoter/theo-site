### TITLE
God Transcendent - J. Gresham Machen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century milieu (published in the 1930s); set against the American fundamentalist-modernist controversy and the decline of nineteenth-century liberal Protestantism. Machen writes as a conservative Presbyterian and Princeton-trained scholar reacting to modernist theology and religious naturalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christianity must preserve the doctrine of God's transcendence: God is ontologically other and sovereign, knowable only because he graciously reveals himself. Denials of transcendence reduce Christianity to ethics, culture, or mere religious experience.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Contemporary theology tends toward immanence (God absorbed into human culture/experience) or skepticism about supernatural revelation.
 - Affirmation: Classical biblical theism insists on both God's otherness (transcendence) and his communicative action (special revelation) so that humans can know and be saved by God.
 - Implications: Faith and repentance are responses to revealed, personal God (not mere moral reform or sentimental religion); natural theology has limited but subordinate role; Scripture and Christ are central loci of divine self-disclosure.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit and explicit contrasts with German liberalism (e.g., Schleiermacherian emphasis on religious feeling), American modernists, and religious humanism. Draws on Scripture, historic Reformed theology, and patristic/classical theism resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special vs general), divine transcendence and immanence, knowability of God, faith and repentance, authority of Scripture, providence and sovereignty, the supernatural (miracle and revelation).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Christianity is true only as the religion of a transcendent, self-revealing God whose sovereign initiative makes faith and repentance possible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong, polemical insistence that transcendence must not be domesticated into ethical or cultural categories; transcendence is compatible with genuine knowability because God condescends in revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects Schleiermacher's reduction of religion to feeling and the modernist tendency to naturalize Christianity; opposes any account that makes God merely immanent or assimilated to human values.
 - While affirming revelation like neo-orthodoxy, Machen remains distinctively conservative: he defends historical claims (miracles, resurrection) and biblical authority against purely existential readings.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "transcendent" as a corrective slogan in American Protestant debate: not a new metaphysical system but a sharpening of classical theistic categories for pastoral and apologetic use.
- **Reception and influence**
 - High influence in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles; contributed to the intellectual foundations of Westminster Theological Seminary and the Orthodox Presbyterian Church. Widely read by those resisting theological liberalism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable resource for teaching on revelation and theism; supplies a clear, tightly argued polemic for courses on doctrine of God, apologetics, and pastoral catechesis on faith and repentance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Transcendence**
 - God's ontological otherness; Machen stresses it so that God is neither reducible to nature nor to human culture.
- **Immanence**
 - The rival tendency Machen critiques - when God is confined to human experience or ethical ideals.
- **Revelation (special)**
 - Divine self-disclosure in Scripture and Christ; primary means by which the transcendent God becomes knowable.
- **General revelation / Natural theology**
 - A real but limited witness to God's existence and attributes; cannot substitute for saving knowledge provided by special revelation.
- **Faith**
 - Intellectual assent plus personal trust in the revealed God; not mere feeling nor mere ethical alignment.
 - Use: cited in "Faith And Repentance" discussions to ground faith as response to divine revelation.
- **Repentance**
 - Genuine turning from sin enabled by recognition of God's holiness and grace; more than moral improvement - a conversional reorientation.
 - Use: employed in pastoral loci and the "Faith And Repentance" topic to distinguish true penitence from reformist religiosity.
- **Knowability of God**
 - Affirmed: God is knowable because he reveals himself, though not exhaustively; knowledge is propositional and relational.
 - Use: cited in "Existence And Knowability Of God" debates to argue that transcendence does not preclude rational and experiential knowledge.
- **Authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as normative vehicle of God's self-revelation; historical claims and miracles defended against reduction.
- **Supernatural / Miracle**
 - Upholds miracles as integral evidences of divine intervention and revelation.
- **Divine sovereignty**
 - Emphasized to ground repentance, faith, and revelation as gifts rather than mere human achievements.
- **Religious experience**
 - Acknowledged but corrected: authentic experience must be judged by revelation, not elevated above it.
- **Liberalism / Modernism**
 - The primary polemic target; Machen uses the term to denote tendencies that dilute doctrine into culture or ethics.
- **Classical theism**
 - The theological backdrop Machen revives for an American audience.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a polemic and definitional source against theological liberalism and religious humanism.
 - As a doctrinal and pedagogical resource for the doctrine of God (transcendence and knowability) and the pastoral loci of faith and repentance.
