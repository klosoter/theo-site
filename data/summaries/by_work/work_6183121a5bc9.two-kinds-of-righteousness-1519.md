### TITLE
**Two Kinds of Righteousness** (1519) - Martin Luther

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early Reformation (1519), immediate post-95 Theses period; part of Luther's rapid theological maturation and break with late-medieval scholasticism.
 - Audience: disputation and pastoral polemic against the church's reliance on merit, works, and sacramental/infusion models of righteousness.

- **Central thesis**
 - There are two fundamentally distinct kinds of righteousness: a passive, alien righteousness by which sinners are reckoned righteous before God (grounded in Christ and received by faith), and an active, civil or moral righteousness of life produced as the fruit of faith and the Spirit.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical hinge on Paul (especially Romans): righteousness before God is not achieved by works but is received.
 - Distinction made to preserve forensic justification: one righteousness is imputed/given (alien), the other is operative in life (proper).
 - Passive/alien righteousness: Christ's obedience/merit accounted to the believer; received through faith; grounds forgiveness and standing.
 - Active/proper righteousness: the believer's works, love, and obedience as visible fruit, necessary for civil order and sanctification but not the ground of justification.
 - Pneumatic dimension: the Holy Spirit unites believers to Christ, making the passive righteousness effective and enabling the active righteousness as response.
 - Polemic moves: rejects merit-based righteousness, merit as intrinsic supernatural quality (infused righteousness), and scholastic conflations of justification and sanctification.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary authority: Paul (Romans); secondary appeal to Augustine against medieval sacramental and scholastic models.
 - Implicit opponents: late-medieval scholasticism (Aquinas-influenced manuals), proponents of infused righteousness and merit, ecclesiastical practice of indulgences.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic/imputed), sanctification (as fruit), Christology (Christ's active obedience), pneumatology (Spirit as agent of union), soteriology, anthropology (sin and status), law and gospel distinction.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Justification is received, not earned: believers are declared righteous through union with Christ by the Spirit and faith; good works are the necessary fruit, not the procuring cause, of that status.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp, programmatic twofold distinction that protects forensic justification while accounting for moral renewal.
 - Emphasis on union with Christ as the ontological/relational ground for imputed righteousness rather than a merely juridical declaration unconnected to the Spirit.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects medieval "infused righteousness" and merit-theology by insisting on alien/imputed righteousness.
 - Contrasts with both Pelagian work-righteousness and any view that collapses justification into sanctification.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of the binary "two kinds" language as a theological method for parsing soteriological categories.
 - Elevates the forensic-imputed language alongside relational union as mutually reinforcing explains of justification.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for Lutheran scholasticism and later Lutheran confessions; major fodder for the Protestant-Roman Catholic controversies on justification.
 - Adopted, adapted, and debated in Reformed circles: Reformed theologians preserved imputation but developed different accounts of union and sanctification; later controversies (e.g., Osiander) pivoted on similar categories.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the justification-sanctification relation; remains a concise pedagogical resource for teaching law-gospel, union with Christ, and the role of the Spirit in salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Passive righteousness (iustitia passiva, iustitia aliena)** - righteousness alien to the sinner, Christ's merit imputed by faith.
- **Active/proper righteousness (iustitia activa, iustitia propria)** - the believer's moral obedience and works; fruit of faith.
- **Imputation** - accounting Christ's obedience to the believer; central to forensic justification.
- **Infusion vs. imputation** - Luther rejects infusion (virtue infused as the ground) in favor of imputation (status given).
- **Forensic justification** - legal declaration of righteousness before God distinguished from moral change.
- **Union with Christ** - the relational/ontological bond effected by the Spirit that grounds the reception of passive righteousness.
 - Connects directly to the topics: "Union With Christ" (site usage) - Luther treats union as the instrument by which Christ's righteousness becomes the believer's.
- **Holy Spirit (pneumatology)** - the agent effecting union, producing sanctifying fruit; not merely an add-on but integral to receiving righteousness.
 - Connects to the topic: "Spirit And Union With Christ" (site usage) - Luther emphasizes the Spirit's role in uniting believer to Christ so that imputation becomes effectual.
- **Law and Gospel** - law condemns and drives to Christ; gospel declares the alien righteousness given.
- **Merit** - rejected as the ground of justification; redefined as a responsibility for Christian life, not divine acceptance.
- **Simul iustus et peccator (implicit)** - believer is simultaneously declared righteous while still bearing remaining sin (phrase develops later but concept present).
- **New obedience** - the necessary ethical outflow of justified life; distinct in status from the ground of justification.
- **Alienity (alienitas)** - theological category: righteousness as "other" to the sinner until received by faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for Protestant doctrines of justification and imputation.
 - As a **polemic tool** against medieval infusion/merit doctrines and later Roman Catholic defenses.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts (esp. Romans) through the law/gospel and union-with-Christ lens.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of pneumatology and the mechanics of union with Christ (linking Spirit and imputation).
