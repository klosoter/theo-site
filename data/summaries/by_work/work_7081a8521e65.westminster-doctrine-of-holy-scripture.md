### TITLE
**Westminster Doctrine of Holy Scripture - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton Presbyterian context; Warfield as leading Old School Reformed theologian at Princeton Seminary.
 - Produced amid challenges from German higher criticism, liberal theology, and Roman Catholic claims about Tradition and Magisterium.
 - Meant to restate the Westminster Confession's doctrine of Scripture for a modern audience and to defend orthodox Protestant norms.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster doctrine affirms Scripture as the verbally inspired, infallible, and authoritative rule of faith and practice, with the church's confessional tradition serving as a subordinate, ministerial witness rather than a co‑equal source.
 - Primary problem: how to maintain the Bible's unique authority and trustworthiness in the face of historical-critical skepticism and rival claims of ecclesial Tradition.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Historical and confessional exposition of the Westminster Confession's statements concerning Scripture.
 - Positive theological defense:
 - Scripture as revelation: God's self-disclosure given in propositional, objective form.
 - Inspiration: a divine origination of the Scriptures (Warfield emphasizes plenary, verbal inspiration).
 - Inerrancy/infallibility: Scripture, properly understood in its autographic intent, is without error in its assertions.
 - Authority and sufficiency: Scripture is the supreme rule; confessions and councils are subordinate testimonies.
 - Polemical moves against:
 - Higher criticism that reduces Scripture to human product or fallible report.
 - Roman Catholicism's elevation of Tradition/Magisterium to co‑equal authority.
 - Canon and tradition analyzed:
 - Canon is attested by the church but not produced or normatively constituted by ecclesiastical tradition.
 - Tradition is a secondary, interpretive witness that depends upon Scripture's prior authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to the Westminster Confession, Reformed tradition, and patristic evidence.
 - Engages broadly with German higher critics (methodologically) and with contemporary Anglican/Presbyterian debates.
 - Implicit contrasts with Roman Catholic theologians advocating Tradition as source.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration (verbal plenary), inerrancy/infallibility, authority, sufficiency, canon formation, illumination, role of confessions/tradition, hermeneutical principles.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's theological center of gravity: Scripture alone (sola Scriptura) as God's verbally inspired, infallible, and sufficient rule, with tradition as a faithful but subordinate witness to that supreme norm.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong articulation of **verbal plenary inspiration** combined with a careful historiographical defense of the Westminster Confession.
 - Nuanced use of historical-critical tools where appropriate, without conceding theologically to methodological naturalism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modernist reductions that make Scripture primarily religious experience or ethical instruction.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholicism by denying Tradition a co‑equal normative status; contrasts with some Enlightenment critics by defending supernatural revelation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Sharp differentiation between the church's recognition of the **canon** and the canon's **intrinsic authority** - the church witnesses to, but does not create, the Scripture's authority.
 - Clarifies the language of "inerrancy" in service of confessional, not speculative, theology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and broader evangelical circles; foundational for 20th-century defenses of inerrancy.
 - Provoked critique from liberal theologians and later revisionists who sought different accounts of revelation and Scripture.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, confessional model for training ministers in a Reformed understanding of Scripture.
 - Remains a go-to resource for those defending classical Protestant doctrines of inspiration and the subordinate role of tradition.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Doctrine of Holy Scripture**
 - Confessional summary asserting Scripture as the supreme rule, inspired and sufficient.

- **Verbal plenary inspiration**
 - Every word (verbal) and the whole (plenary) of Scripture are divinely originated.

- **Inerrancy / Infallibility**
 - Scripture, as originally given, is without error in what it affirms; infallible in its purpose to reveal God for faith and life.

- **Canon**
 - The set of books acknowledged as Scripture; recognized by the church but whose authority precedes ecclesial recognition.

- **Tradition**
 - Ecclesial memory and interpretive practice; important as witness and guard but subordinate to Scripture.

- **Confessional subscription**
 - The doctrine that confessions (e.g., Westminster) are subordinate standards that articulate Scripture's teaching for church order and ministry.

- **Authority vs. Magisterium**
 - Authority: Scripture's normative rule. Magisterium (Roman concept): Warfield rejects parity with Scripture.

- **Self-attestation / illumination**
 - The Holy Spirit enables the believer to recognize and accept Scripture's divine authority; Scripture witnesses to itself under the Spirit's action.

- **Sufficiency**
 - Scripture contains all things necessary for salvation and godly living; tradition cannot add to salvific revelation.

- **Original autographs**
 - The doctrine that inerrancy properly refers to the original inspired texts.

- **Hermeneutical norms**
 - Rules implied by Warfield: literal/grammatical interpretation within redemptive-historical context; confessionally governed exegesis.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for confessional doctrines of inspiration and inerrancy.
 - As a **polemic** against higher criticism and against Roman claims to co‑equal Tradition.
 - As an **exegetical and pedagogical model** within Reformed seminaries for integrating confessional fidelity with historical awareness.
