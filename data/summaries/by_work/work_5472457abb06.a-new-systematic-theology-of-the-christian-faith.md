### TITLE
A New Systematic Theology of the Christian Faith - Robert L. Reymond

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century conservative Reformed theology; written as a readable, confessional alternative to more technical scholastic systems and to liberal/neo-orthodox trends.
 - Situated within the post-war Reformed resurgence that emphasized biblical inerrancy, covenant theology, and confessional fidelity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To present a single, coherent, biblically grounded, confessional Reformed system that defends God's sovereignty, the authority of Scripture, covenant theology, and classical doctrines of sin and redemption against modern deviations.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with prolegomena (Scripture, revelation, inspiration, interpretation).
 - Moves through doctrine of God (Trinity, attributes, providence), decrees, Christology (person and work), soteriology (sin, election, justification, sanctification), church and sacraments, and eschatology.
 - Method: exegetical engagement with key biblical texts + systematic synthesis using historic Reformed confessions (Westminster, Belgic, etc.).
 - Major moves:
 - Affirmation of propositional, objective revelation in Scripture.
 - Defense of unconditional election and divine decrees as comprehensive and purposive.
 - Covenantal framework as the organizing principle for redemptive history.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed writers (Calvin, Augustine, the Westminster divines) and modern Reformed teachers.
 - Critically engages contemporary positions: Arminian forecasts (simple foreknowledge), theological liberalism, neo-orthodoxy (Barthian tendencies), and certain popular theological trends (dispensationalism, subjective religion).
 - Dialogues with systematicians within evangelicalism and Reformed scholastics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Bibliology, God/Trinity, Providence/Decrees, Creation/Anthropology, Sin, Christology (hypostatic union), Atonement, Election & Reprobation, Justification, Sanctification, Church and Sacraments, Eschatology.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - A robustly confessional, scripture-rooted Reformed system that centers divine sovereignty and covenantal redemption as the organizing logic of Christian faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Strong stress on the unity of God's decrees: election and reprobation are part of one eternal plan directed to God's glory and justice.
 - Clear, pastoral tone combined with confessional precision-intended for both seminary use and pastoral application.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against theological proposals that subordinate divine sovereignty to human freedom (Arminian foreknowledge models).
 - Counters neo-orthodox and liberal de-emphases of propositional revelation; insists on inerrant, objective Scripture.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Not many neologisms; rather, Reymond re-presents classic Reformed terms (e.g., decree, covenant, imputation) in contemporary, readable form and applies them systematically across loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used as a conservative Reformed textbook and reference; valued in Presbyterian and Reformed seminaries.
 - Praised for clarity and confessional fidelity; critiqued by some for limited engagement with continental/critical scholarship.

- **Enduring value**
 - A firm, accessible synthesis of Reformed orthodoxy particularly useful for pastors, students, and conservative systematicians seeking a covenantal, Scripture-centered framework.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scripture / Propositional Revelation** - Scripture as the authoritative, inerrant, propositional word of God; the normative rule for faith and life.
- **Divine Decree (comprehensive)** - God's eternal, sovereign plan ordering creation, fall, election, and redemption as one purposive act.
 - **Election & Reprobation** - Defended as real, divine acts within the single decree; rejects simple foreknowledge and affirms God's sovereign gracious election and just reprobation (see locus on Divine Decrees).
- **Sovereignty of God** - Central organizing principle; God's sovereignty governs salvation history and providence.
- **Covenant Theology** - Covenant of works and covenant of grace as the primary interpretive framework for Scripture and redemptive history.
- **Original Sin / Total Depravity** - Humanity radically affected by the Fall; incapacity for salvific choice apart from divine grace.
- **Christology (Hypostatic Union)** - Jesus as fully God and fully man; atonement seen within covenantal substitutionary terms.
- **Justification by Faith / Imputation** - Forensic declaration based on Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Sanctification / Perseverance** - Progressive work of the Spirit producing holiness; perseverance of the saints as consistent with covenantal promise.
- **Ecclesiology & Sacraments** - Church as covenant community, sacraments as means of grace within a covenantal economy.
- **Anthropology: Dichotomy** - Defends a **dichotomous** view (body + immaterial soul/spirit often used interchangeably) and rejects classical trichotomy; emphasizes biblical usage where "soul" and "spirit" are functional rather than ontologically distinct (see Trichotomy vs Dichotomy reference).
- **Eschatology** - Generally conservative, covenantal reading of last things with emphasis on consummation in Christ.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed terms (election, covenant, imputation).
 - As a **polemic** against Arminianism, liberalism, and trichotomy proponents.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for applying key biblical texts to classical systematic loci and for teaching conservative seminary courses.
