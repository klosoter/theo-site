### TITLE
The Covenant of Grace (1953) - John Murray

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century Reformed theology; Westminster/Princeton-influenced milieu reacting to both liberal theology and rising dispensationalist readings of Scripture. Murray published as a clarification of confessional covenant theology in a period of renewed interest in federal structures.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Reaffirm and explicate the **one covenant of grace** as the single, continuous redemptive covenant administered differently in redemptive history - countering fragmenting schemas that multiply covenants or dislocate Old/New continuity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define covenant of grace as God's promise of salvation fulfilled in Christ and grounded in God's eternal purpose.
 - Distinguish **substance** (one covenant) from **administrations** (diverse historical forms: promise, law, sacrament, prophetic/typological forms).
 - Locate Christ as the mediatorial center: covenant realized and secured by the Mediator, with union with Christ as covenantal participation.
 - Treat sacraments and signs as **seals** and means by which the covenant is administered and applied.
 - Reconcile confessional formulations (Westminster, Reformed confessions) with biblical exegesis of covenant texts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformed confessional standards (Westminster Confession), Calvin and Reformed orthodox writers, contemporary covenant and dispensational interpreters; appeals to Scripture across Testaments and to federal theology tradition.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology (primary), revelation and Scripture as covenantal witness, Christology (mediatorial work), soteriology (promise, justification, imputation), sacramentology (seals of covenant), typology, law/gospel relation, election implied in covenantal promise.
- **Closing line:** The work insists that the gospel is covenantal promise centered in Christ - a single, continuous covenant of grace administered diversely through redemptive history and secured by the Mediator.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **oneness of substance** in the covenant of grace despite multiple administrations - avoids both reduction to a single form and fragmentation into multiple covenants.
 - Clear linking of **covenant and gospel**: the covenant of grace is not merely a legal framework but the very form of the gospel promise.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Correction of views that treat Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic covenants as separate salvific covenants in substance; instead Murray treats them as **administrations** of one covenant.
 - Polemic against dispensational or sectional readings that sever Old and New Testaments or posit conflicting covenants.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refinement of the distinction between **substance** and **administration** of covenant - used as a clarifying tool in subsequent covenantal discussions.
 - Emphasis on mediatorial and objective structures (promise, imputation, union) as constitutive of the covenant.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely respected in mid- and late-20th-century Reformed circles; became a touchstone for conservative confessional covenant theology.
 - Influenced later systematicians and pastors defending covenant continuity, sacramental theology, and the confessional reading of redemptive history.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Concise, confessional articulation used in seminary instruction as a reliable summary of classical Reformed covenantal commitments.
 - Valuable corrective to both antinomian and dispensational distortions; serves as a compact model for integrating Christology, soteriology, and sacramentology under covenantal categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace:** God's single promissory covenant to save sinners, the gospel circuit of promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Administration(s) of the Covenant:** Historical modes in which the covenant is revealed and applied (e.g., promise, law-tutelage, sacraments, typology).
- **Substance vs. Administration:** Distinction asserting one covenantal substance with multiple historical administrations.
- **Mediator / Mediatorial Work:** Christ as the indispensable center who secures and enacts the covenant through his life, death, resurrection.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** Background intra-Trinitarian agreement occasionally presupposed but subordinated to the forensic/mediatorial emphasis of the covenant of grace.
- **Promise:** The covenant's forensic character - salvation given by divine promise not by human merit.
- **Seals / Sacraments:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenantal signs and seals that confirm and communicate covenant promise to the faithful.
- **Typology:** Old Testament people, rites, and institutions as **administrative** anticipations that point to the one covenant's fulfillment in Christ.
- **Imputation / Federal Headship:** The transfer of Christ's righteousness to believers and the representative character of Adam and Christ in covenant economy.
- **Law-Gospel Relation:** Law as tutor within the covenant framework, not a rival covenant; obedience is required as response but not the ground of covenant acceptance.
- **Union with Christ:** The objective covenantal bond by which believers partake in the covenant promises and benefits.
- **Confessional Corroboration:** Use of Westminster and Reformed confessions to anchor the theological claims in ecclesial formularies.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classical Reformed covenantal categories (seminary syllabi, handbooks).
- As a **polemic resource** against dispensational fragmentation and modern multiplicitous covenant schemes.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Old and New Testament covenant texts within a single redemptive-historical framework.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology, sacramentology, and soteriology under the rubric of covenantal promise and administration.
