### TITLE
Commentary on 1 Corinthians (focus: ch. 15) - Anonymous Late-Antique Exegesis

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Anonymous late-antique commentary, undated; internal linguistic and exegetical features point to a patristic milieu (plausibly 3rd-5th century), with likely Eastern Mediterranean provenance. 
 - Composed amid controversies over bodily resurrection and Hellenistic dualism; reads Paul against contemporaneous denials of corporeal eschatology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - To vindicate the bodily resurrection as essential to Christian hope and identity: the Corinthians must affirm continuity and transformation of the body, not spiritualized denial or crude resuscitation.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Close exegesis of 1 Cor 15:1-58, proceeding clause by clause. Major moves: 
 - Affirmation of the kerygma (15:1-11) as apostolic deposit and proof of Christ's historical resurrection. 
 - Correction of Corinthian error: denial of the resurrection is tantamount to gospel-subversion and moral disorder (15:12-19). 
 - Typology and cosmological scaffolding: Adam and Christ as heads of two humanity-orders (15:20-28). 
 - Ontology of the resurrection body: contrast between "natural" and "spiritual" body (15:35-49); emphasis on transformation rather than annihilation or simple resuscitation. 
 - Eschatological consummation: the last enemy (death) destroyed; bodily life reconstituted in new-creation terms (15:50-58).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (1 Cor 15). Secondary engagement with Hellenistic dualism, rival teachers in Corinth, and broader patristic language/traditions (without explicit attributions). Occasional allusive parallels with canonical typology (Adam/Christ) and liturgical memory (creedal formulae).
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Resurrection, eschatological anthropology, Christology (historic resurrection of Christ), soteriology (union with Christ and bodily glorification), ecclesiology (kerygmatic and moral implications), implicit pneumatology (Spirit as agent of transformation).
- **Closing line:** 
 - The work centers on the claim that Christian hope is a bodily, historical, and transformative promise: resurrection secures both personal continuity and participation in the new creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on bodily continuity: resurrection is a transformation (metamorphosis) of the same person, not mere reanimation or pure immaterial survival. 
 - Links the resurrection intimately with new-creation language-resurrection as inauguration of cosmic renewal, not merely individual soteriology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on allegorizing approaches that spiritualize Paul's body-language; counters dualistic tendencies that denigrate matter. 
 - More concrete than some allegorical interpreters (e.g., selective Origenism): keeps historical particularity (Christ's corpse/empty tomb) central to theology.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Deploys a concise pairing of "corruptible/incorruptible" and "natural/spiritual" bodies to explain continuity and discontinuity-anticipatory of later technical language for "resurrection body." 
 - Emphasizes agency of divine will and creative power in transformation (not simply moral fitness).
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - As anonymous, direct historical footprint is diffuse but the commentary preserves an exegetical approach that surfaces in later medieval and Reformation treatments of 1 Cor 15-used as a representative patristic witness for bodily eschatology. 
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Concise, text-driven defense of bodily resurrection that models how exegesis, doctrinal correction, and pastoral concern converge; valuable for courses on resurrection theology and the formation of eschatological anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma (Pauline deposit):** the apostolic proclamation as normative and evidential (1 Cor 15:1-11). 
- **Bodily continuity:** insistence that identity persists through transformation-same person, transformed body. 
- **Corruptible / Incorruptible:** moral-ontological categories used to mark the change effected at resurrection. 
- **Soma psychikon / Soma pneumatikon (natural/spiritual body):** operational distinctions to explain mortality vs glorified life without endorsing Platonic denigration of flesh. 
- **Adam / Christ typology:** two representative heads establishing two orders of humanity and destiny. 
- **Metamorphosis (transformation):** preferred verb/image for what happens to the body at resurrection-creationally powerful, divinely wrought change. 
- **Last enemy: Death:** eschatological adversary finally destroyed; resurrection as victory over cosmic death. 
- **New creation:** framing resurrection within cosmic renewal; individual resurrection participates in covenantal restoration of creation. 
- **Historical particularity:** emphasis on Christ's historical death and bodily resurrection as the anchor of hope. 
- **Pneumatological agency:** Spirit as enabling principle of bodily transformation (implicit in the commentary's logic). 
- **Eschatological anthropology:** anthropology oriented to future consummation-personhood defined by destiny as well as origins.
- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for the doctrine of the resurrection body in patristic-theological surveys. 
 - As a **polemic text** against dualistic or spiritualizing readings of resurrection in systematic and historical theology. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for close Pauline exegesis combining creedal material, typology, and moral exhortation. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking individual soteriology to cosmic new-creation, employed in teaching on eschatology and Christian anthropology.
