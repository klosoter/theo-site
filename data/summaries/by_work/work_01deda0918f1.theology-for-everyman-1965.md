### TITLE
Theology for Everyman (1965) - John H. Gerstner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-20th century conservative Reformed evangelical milieu. Published amid postwar theological debates: reaction to liberal theology, rising ecumenical movements, and renewed interest in popular catechesis and lay systematic theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To present orthodox Reformed doctrine in plain, accessible language for laymen while defending the historic Christian doctrines against modern relativism and theological dilution. Emphasizes God's sovereignty and the objective truth of Scripture.
- **Core argument or structure:** A popular systematic treatment that moves through classical loci with pastoral clarity.
 - Begins with Scripture and revelation as normative authority (sola Scriptura).
 - Develops the doctrine of God and Trinity to ground theism and divine sovereignty.
 - Treats creation, fall, sin, and human incapacity to save itself.
 - Presents Christology and atonement as centerpieces of redemption (penal substitution and substitutionary atonement emphasized).
 - Explains election, effectual calling, justification by faith, sanctification, and final perseverance.
 - Concludes with eschatology stressing bodily resurrection, final judgment, and eternal states (heaven and hell).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as chief source; draws often on Augustine, John Calvin, and the Westminster Standards; polemically engages modernist/liberal theologians and Arminian critiques.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation/Scripture, God/Trinity, providence, sin and total depravity, Christology, atonement, justification, election/predestination, sanctification, sacraments, ecclesiology, eschatology (including final judgment and eternal states).
- **Closing line:** A forthright, pastorally oriented Reformed systematic aiming to equip ordinary Christians with the doctrines of divine sovereignty, redemption in Christ, and the reality of final judgment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Plain-language Reformed orthodoxy:** theological density presented without technical obscurity, designed for lay uptake.
 - **Pastoral apologetic focus:** doctrine defended not merely for intellectual assent but for assurance, holiness, and evangelistic urgency.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back strongly against theological liberalism and existentialist reinterpretations that dilute objective truth claims of Scripture.
 - Distinguishes clearly from Arminianism by affirming corporate and particular aspects of election and divine sovereignty in salvation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** No radical neologisms - rather, a re-presentation of classic Reformed terms in contemporary idiom so lay readers can employ them confidently.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely used in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles as an accessible introduction to systematic theology; valued by pastors and lay leaders for catechetical use. Not widely adopted in mainline liberal contexts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Serves as a compact model of how to teach rigorous Reformed theology to non-specialists; useful as a bridge between academic systematic works and devotional/catechetical materials.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura:** Scripture as the final authority; Gerstner insists all doctrine must be judged by biblical testimony.
- **Divine sovereignty:** God's absolute rule over creation and salvation; central hermeneutic for soteriology and providence.
- **Total depravity:** Human inability to effect saving change apart from divine grace.
- **Penal substitutionary atonement:** Christ bore penalty due to sinners; presented as the biblical explanation of redemption.
- **Election/predestination:** God's prior choice of sinners unto salvation; used to explain assurance and perseverance.
- **Justification by faith:** Forensic declaration of righteousness through faith in Christ, not by works.
- **Resurrection of the body:** Bodily resurrection as essential to final hope and to the vindication at the final judgment.
- **Particular vs. General Judgment:** Implicitly distinguishes immediate judicial consequences at death (particular) and the final public, cosmic verdict at Christ's return (general).
- **Final judgment:** Christ's public adjudication of all, resulting in everlasting reward or punishment; Gerstner stresses its objective and solemn reality.
- **Eternal states - Heaven:** Eternal communion with God, final blessedness rooted in resurrected life.
- **Eternal states - Hell:** Eternal conscious punishment for the unrepentant; affirmed as just and necessary given divine holiness.
- **Assurance of salvation:** Grounded in objective promises and effectual calling, not in subjective perfection.
- **Sola fide / forensic language:** Uses legal metaphors to secure clarity on justification and judgment.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for basic Reformed terms and pastoral catechesis.
- As a **polemic** against liberal and Arminian reinterpretations, especially on election and final judgment.
- As an **exegetical/disciplinary model** for translating systematic loci (eschatology, soteriology) into lay instruction and preaching.
