### TITLE
Old Testament and Christian Doctrine - Henri Blocher

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical-Reformed theological conversation. Blocher writes from a French evangelical vantage seeking a theologically robust but historically responsible account of how the Old Testament functions within Christian doctrine. The work is situated against both liberal historical-critical reductionism and pietistic/dispensational separations of Testaments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Old Testament must be read as a theologically authoritative and indispensable witness that both grounds and anticipates Christian doctrine. It is neither a mere prelude to the New Testament nor an autonomous closed system; rather, the OT exhibits a promise-fulfillment economy whose proper reading yields Christ-centered doctrine without obliterating the OT's own integrity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of the OT as divine revelation with its own covenantal center (promise, law, worship, prophetism).
 - Defense of a historically anchored typology: OT persons, events, and institutions function as genuine analogues (types) whose meaning is fulfilled and transformed in Christ (antitype).
 - Proposal for a hermeneutic that balances **continuity and discontinuity**: continuity through covenantal promise and canonical fulfillment; discontinuity where Christ redefines and consummates OT institutions.
 - Application to major doctrinal loci (covenant, Christology, soteriology, eschatology, worship) showing how OT material shapes and constrains New Testament doctrinal formulations.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical Reformers (notably Calvin), patristic typology, 20th-century biblical theology (e.g., von Rad-style salvation-history), contemporary evangelical exegetes; Blocher also addresses historical-critical tendencies that depersonalize typology and those modern readings that over-allegorize.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant and promise, typology, Christology (prefiguration and fulfillment), soteriology (OT contributions to understanding justification and atonement), law and gospel relations, priesthood/temple, eschatology.
- **Closing line:** The Old Testament is a covenantal, Christ-directed corpus whose typological and promise-laden witness must be read historically and canonically to form sound Christian doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses a *historical-theological typology* - types are rooted in real historical events yet derive their ultimate meaning in Christ.
 - Frames OT use in doctrine primarily through **promise-fulfillment logic** rather than loose allegory or purely moral application.
 - Insists on the OT's normative theological role rather than treating it as merely preparatory background.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against both reductive historical criticism that evacuates theological significance and against naïve allegorical or dispensational readings that detach types from history.
 - Reclaims classical Reformed emphases (covenant, Christ as key) but corrects tendencies to press continuity so far that the distinctiveness of the New Covenant is obscured.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Articulates a compact vocabulary for typology that combines historicity, canonicity, and christological fulfillment without sliding into either docetic or purely symbolic accounts.
 - Clarifies levels of continuity/discontinuity at which law, cult, and promise operate theologically.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed and evangelical seminaries for its disciplined approach to OT theology and doctrine; frequently cited for hermeneutical balance.
 - Particularly influential among French-speaking evangelicals and used as a bridge text for anglophone students encountering continental Reformed nuance.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a corrective to both anti-OT tendencies and uncritical typologizing; useful for doctrine-builders, homileticians, and OT theologians seeking a canonical, Christ-centered reading.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berit):** The organizing framework; promise/obligation structure that links OT events to NT fulfillment.
- **Typology (type/antitype):** Real historical persons/events/institutions that prefigure Christ; meaning fulfilled in Christ without losing historicity.
- **Promise-fulfillment:** Hermeneutical principle: OT promises receive fulfillment and clarification in Christ and the New Covenant.
- **Canonical reading:** Reading the OT within the canon and in light of the Christ-event, not isolated as pre-canonical history.
- **Continuity and discontinuity:** A dialectic Blocher uses to navigate law, cult, and covenantal change across Testaments.
- **Salvation history (heilsgeschichte):** OT as part of a progressive divine action culminating in Christ; historical progression is theological.
- **Christological hermeneutic:** Christ as the key to interpreting OT significance for doctrine.
- **Theological realism:** Assertion that OT events have real, not merely symbolic, ontological significance for Christian doctrine.
- **Law and gospel relation:** OT law as covenantally embedded and fulfilled/applied in Christendom without simple abrogation.
- **Worship/temple typology:** Temple and cult as prefigurative of Christ and the eschatological consummation, read historically and sacramentally.
- **Prophetic promise:** Prophecy as promise with eschatological and christological horizons.
- **Historical-critical engagement:** Critical methods acknowledged but subordinated to a theological canonical reading.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a disciplined, historical-theological concept of typology.
 - As a **hermeneutical model** for integrating OT material into systematic loci (Christology, covenant, soteriology).
 - As a moderate **polemic** against both reductionist criticism and indiscriminate allegorizing.
 - As an **exegetical exemplar** for preaching and doctrine that seeks canonical coherence between Testaments.
