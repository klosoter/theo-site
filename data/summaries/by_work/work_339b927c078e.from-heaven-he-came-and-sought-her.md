### TITLE
From Heaven He Came and Sought Her - Michael Bird and Michael P. Jensen (IVP Academic, 2013)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical and Reformed conversation (early 21st century) surrounding the atonement debate: renewed critique of classical "limited/particular" atonement by proponents of unlimited atonement (Arminian, Amyraldian, and some modern Evangelical authors). The volume appears amid pastoral anxieties about divine love, justice, and evangelistic language.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** A sustained defense of **definite (particular) atonement** - that Christ's death was intentionally and effectively aimed at securing salvation for the elect/the church - framed as both biblically warranted and theologically coherent with Trinitarian and covenant convictions.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical survey of how Reformed and patristic traditions have understood the particularity of Christ's saving work.
 - Biblical-exegetical chapters treating key texts (e.g., John 10; Romans 8-9; Hebrews; passages on propitiation and substitution) to show intention and efficacy toward a defined people.
 - Systematic theological integration linking atonement to **covenant union**, election, and the person and work of Christ.
 - Pastoral reflections on preaching, evangelism, assurance, and pastoral care that flow from a doctrine of definite atonement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Reformed classics (Calvin, Owen, Edwards), scholastic formulations, Amyraldian and Arminian critics, and contemporary evangelical interlocutors. The book dialogues with modern theological concerns about divine love and the scope of Christ's death.
- **Doctrines treated:** Atonement (penal substitution, propitiation, expiation), election, covenant theology, Christology (union with Christ), soteriology (efficacy, sufficiency vs efficiency), grace, and pastoral theology.
- **Closing line:** The volume argues that a biblically faithful and pastorally responsible theology of Christ's death is **definite in intention and efficacious in result**, securing the salvation of a particular people without denying universal sufficiency.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Terminological reframing:** Prefers the term **"definite atonement"** over "limited atonement" to emphasize positive intentionality and pastoral winsomeness rather than a purely negative limit.
- **Covenantal-union emphasis:** Stresses that particularity coheres organically with the doctrine of union with Christ - Christ died to secure his bride, not merely to make salvation possible for all.
- **Integration of disciplines:** Unique structure combining historical, exegetical, systematic, and pastoral treatments in one sustained defense, making the case not simply doctrinally but pastorally.
- **Pastoral recalibration:** Argues that definite atonement provides stronger grounds for assurance and faithful evangelism than models positing an indefinite or merely sufficient atonement.
- **Corrective to rivals:** Challenges Amyraldian/unlimited formulations that split divine intent (Christ died for all but only some are saved) as biblically and theologically discordant; presses critics to account for intentionality and efficacy in the language of saving work.
- **Conceptual innovation:** Emphasizes **intentionality** and **efficacious particularity** as central categories rather than merely "extent" language; reframes polemics in terms of God's committed purpose rather than metaphysical limitation.
- **Reception and influence:** Well used in contemporary Reformed circles as a concise, accessible defense of particular redemption; cited in pastoral and academic settings as a corrective to atonement popularizations that sideline election.
- **Enduring value:** Useful as both a primer on the contemporary debate and a compactly argued resource for teaching the coherence between atonement, election, and pastoral assurance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Definite atonement:** Christ's death was intended to and actually secures salvation for a particular people (the elect/the church).
- **Limited atonement:** Traditional label criticized for negative connotations; authors prefer "definite" to capture intentionality.
- **Particular redemption:** Synonym emphasis: redemption applied to a decided people rather than an indefinite potential for all.
- **Sufficient vs efficient:** Distinguishes universal sufficiency (atonement can purchase salvation in principle) from efficacious particularity (atonement actually achieves salvation for the intended).
- **Amyraldianism (hypothetical universalism):** The view that Christ died for all conditionally but God elects some - identified as a primary interlocutor and critiqued for theological incoherence regarding intent.
- **Penal substitution / propitiation:** Affirmed as the moral/forensic structure of the atonement; argued to be compatible with definite intent.
- **Covenant union / bridal imagery:** Theological framework that explains the atonement's particularity: Christ's love and death are directed to his bride, the church.
- **Efficacious intent / intentionality:** Key analytic move - the purposeful aim of the Redeemer toward a concrete people.
- **Universal atonement (unlimited):** Contrasted position; book sets out reasons to reject the view that Christ intended to save every individual without distinction.
- **Assurance / pastoral implications:** How definite atonement buttresses believers' assurance and shapes evangelistic language.
- **Biblical exegesis model:** Uses texts (John 6/10, Romans 8-9, Hebrews, 1 John) to demonstrate particularity in both divine intent and salvific outcome.

How the work is used:
- As a clear **definition source** and contemporary label-adopter for "definite atonement" within Reformed theology.
- As a **polemic** against Amyraldian and unlimited atonement proposals in academic and pastoral debates.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** linking particularity of atonement to covenant, union with Christ, and pastoral practice.
