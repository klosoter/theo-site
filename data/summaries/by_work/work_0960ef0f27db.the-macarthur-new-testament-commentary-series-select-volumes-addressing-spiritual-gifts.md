### TITLE
**The MacArthur New Testament Commentary Series (selected volumes on spiritual gifts) - John F. MacArthur**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th - early 21st century conservative evangelical milieu; published within a broadly Reformed, dispensational-leaning pastoral scholarship context.
 - Series aims: pastoral expository commentaries for pastors and informed laity; engagement with contemporary charismatic movements from a cessationist standpoint.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament normative pattern for spiritual gifts is to be understood by careful grammatical-historical exegesis; alleged modern charismatic phenomena (tongues, sign gifts as normative) are aberrant and largely non-normative for the post-apostolic church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close verse-by-verse exegesis (especially 1 Corinthians 12-14, Romans 12:3-8, Ephesians 4:7-16).
 - Historical-theological framing: apostolic-age sign gifts served revelatory, foundational roles and are not continuative in the same form.
 - Pastoral application: orderly worship, edification as normative criteria; discernment and correction of ecstatic practices.
 - Recurrent method: linguistic analysis, context, comparison with canonical theology, pastoral implications.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with charismatic and Pentecostal proponents; explicit critique of contemporary charismatic leaders and movements.
 - Scholarly interlocutors include proponents of continuationism (e.g., Gordon D. Fee in the 1 Corinthians conversation) and historical treatments of sign gifts.
 - Site-usage emphases here: *Pentecostalism and Reformed Response* (critique/polemics) and the anthropological debate *Trichotomy vs Dichotomy* (MacArthur aligns with Reformed/dichotomous emphases in pastoral anthropology).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (operation and gifts of the Holy Spirit), ecclesiology (order in worship and offices), revelation (apostolic foundation vs ongoing revelatory gifts), soteriology and sanctification (discernment in practice), anthropology (soul/spirit distinction, rejection of speculative trichotomy).
- **Closing line**
 - The commentaries function as robust, expository, cessationist interventions: Scripture as final authority, orderly edification over ecstatic experience, and gifts interpreted in light of redemptive-historical and pastoral continuity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uncompromising cessationist posture grounded in detailed exegesis of key NT texts; pastoral concern for ecclesial order and public worship.
 - Repeated insistence that ceased revelatory gifts do not supply normative governance or new doctrine.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Direct correction of continuationist readings (contrasts with Gordon D. Fee and many charismatic exegetes).
 - Corrects pietistic or experiential readings that place contemporary glossolalia/prophecy on par with apostolic revelation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much innovation as forceful reapplication: precise criteria for discerning edification vs spectacle; pragmatic distinction between "foundational" and "temporary" gifts in redemptive history.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read in conservative Reformed and evangelical pastoral circles; became a go-to popular scholarly resource for cessationist argumentation.
 - Polarizing for charismatics: influential in shaping Reformed responses to Pentecostalism and fueling polemical exchanges.
- **Enduring value**
 - Strong exegetical model for pastor-scholars; enduring resource for sermons, teaching, and theological courses addressing spiritual gifts, worship order, and pastoral correction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Cessationism**
 - The view that sign/revelatory gifts of the apostolic era have ceased; central interpretive presupposition across these volumes.
- **Continuationism (counter-term)**
 - The opposing view MacArthur argues against; used as primary interlocutor.
- **Sign gifts**
 - Gifts serving apostolic authentication (miracles, tongues, healings) argued to be temporary and foundational.
- **Edification criterion**
 - Practical hermeneutical test: gifts and practices are evaluated by whether they build up the church in intelligibility and order.
- **Orderly worship (1 Cor. 14 hermeneutic)**
 - Emphasis on intelligibility, prophetic priority over tongues, regulation by elders - frequent pastoral prescriptions.
- **Apostolic foundation vs. ongoing revelation**
 - Distinction stressed to deny modern claims to new revelatory authority.
- **Pneumatology**
 - Doctrine of the Spirit focused on normative ministry (illumination, sanctification, ordinary gifting) rather than extraordinary revelatory signs.
- **Anthropology: Dichotomy vs Trichotomy**
 - MacArthur aligns with a dichotomous, or at least non-speculative, approach to soul/spirit distinction; resists speculative trichotomy that undergirds some charismatic pneumatology.
 - Use here: counters claims that glossolalia or ecstatic experience is evidence of a distinct spiritual-substance category in humans.
- **Prophecy (New Testament sense)**
 - Understood as edifying, intelligible proclamation, not private revelatory innovation.
- **Tongues**
 - Treated as either known human languages (when authentic sign) or as ecstatic phenomena requiring regulation; not normative private prayer language.
- **Foundational vs. Ordinary Gifts**
 - Hermeneutical distinction for redemptive-historical placement of gifts.
- **Discernment**
 - Pastoral skill emphasized for distinguishing hypocrisy, fanaticism, and genuine Spirit-led ministry.
- **Expository method**
 - Model: verse-by-verse grammatical-historical exegesis with pastoral application.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** in seminary classes for reading 1 Corinthians, Romans, Ephesians on gifts and worship.
 - As a **polemic/reference** in debates with Pentecostal/charismatic movements (defending cessationism and orderly worship).
 - As a **definition source** for pastoral practice on public order, eldership authority, and criteria for spiritual gifts.
