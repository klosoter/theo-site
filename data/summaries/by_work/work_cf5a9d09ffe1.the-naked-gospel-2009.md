### TITLE
The Naked Gospel (2009) - Andrew S. Farley

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2009 amid postmodern evangelical shifts emphasizing spiritual formation, a reaction against performance-driven Christianity, and debates about "Lordship salvation" and assurance. Written for a broadly evangelical audience rather than technical theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The contemporary church has obscured the gospel with rules and performance expectations; true freedom comes from resting in the definitive, positional work of Christ rather than striving for progressive moral transformation as the ground of acceptance.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnoses a pastoral problem: believers trapped in legalism, guilt, and performance.
 - Reframes sanctification primarily as a **definitive, positional reality** achieved in union with Christ - believers are already holy in Him.
 - Counsels a life of **resting in identity** (faith-as-reception) rather than striving to earn God's favor by moral effort.
 - Offers pastoral application: biblical assurances, reinterpretation of texts used to motivate moral striving, and practical counsel toward grace-led living.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy use of Pauline texts (Romans, Galatians, Colossians); engages modern pastoral practices and unnamed "legalistic" teachers. Implicitly contrasts with Lordship-salvation emphases and traditional progressive sanctification teaching; draws on Protestant sola fide concerns.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (justification, imputed righteousness), sanctification (emphasis on definitive/positional), union with Christ, law vs. grace, assurance, practical ethics.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The gospel is radically sufficient and frees believers to live from a received identity in Christ rather than from ongoing self-effort.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strongly foregrounds **definitive sanctification** (what God has done once-for-all in Christ) as the key locus of Christian assurance and holiness.
 - Presents sanctification primarily as a change of legal status and identity rather than primarily a moral process.
 - Repeated pastoral stress on **rest** and "grace as the operating principle" in daily life.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against pastors/teachers who emphasize behavior modification, moral imperatives, and progressive effort as the primary means of sanctification.
 - Moves beyond simply defending justification by faith to re-centering practical Christian living on positional realities.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Uses the metaphor **"naked"** to mean the gospel stripped of extrabiblical expectations and self-effort.
 - Emphasizes "living from" identity vs. "living for" achievement as a theological-practical distinction.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Popular with readers seeking assurance and relief from performance-based spirituality; used widely in ministry contexts and small groups.
 - Drawn critical attention from pastors and theologians who charge that the book flirts with antinomianism or minimizes the necessity of progressive sanctification and obedience.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Valuable corrective emphasis on union with Christ, assurance, and the danger of performance-based gospel distortions.
 - Requires theological supplementation: a robust biblical account of progressive sanctification, means of grace, and obedience to avoid understating Christians' moral transformation responsibilities.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Naked Gospel:** Gospel freed from additions of performance, religious requirements, and guilt-driven motivation.
- **Definitive sanctification:** The book's central term for the believer's positional holiness achieved in Christ (what God has already done).
- **Progressive sanctification:** Treated skeptically as often overstated; Farley acknowledges growth but resists framing it as the ground of acceptance.
- **Union with Christ:** Key theological vehicle - identity in Christ secures definitive sanctification and assurance.
- **Positional righteousness:** The believer's declared status before God (imputed righteousness), emphasized over conditional moral attainment.
- **Rest in grace:** Practical ethic - Christians are to repose in what Christ has done rather than continually strive to justify themselves.
- **Law vs. grace:** Rearticulated to warn that law-oriented exhortation too often becomes spiritual control and guilt.
- **Assurance:** Strong pastoral claim that assurance flows from positional realities, not fluctuating moral performance.
- **Antinomianism (critique):** Frequent external charge - Farley anticipates but disputes being lawless, maintaining that grace produces freedom to obey without compulsion.
- **Lordship salvation (implicit contrast):** Distinguished from teachings that make conscious submission and progressive transformation evidential prerequisites for justification.
- **Grace-driven obedience:** Attempts to reframe obedience as response to identity rather than as instrument for acceptance.
- **Imputed vs. imparted righteousness:** Imputation is central; imparted (ongoing moral renewal) is acknowledged but deprioritized.
- **Practical sanctification:** Recast as living out positional truths rather than a program of moral achievement.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against performance-based piety and legalistic pastoral praxis.
- As an **assurance/ devotional resource** emphasizing identity in Christ and rest.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on definitive vs. progressive sanctification - useful to provoke balance but requires theological supplements on means of growth and perseverance.
