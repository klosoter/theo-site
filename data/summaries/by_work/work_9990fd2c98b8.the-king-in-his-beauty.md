### TITLE
The King in His Beauty - Thomas R. Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 21st-century evangelical, Reformed academic milieu (Schreiner is a conservative Southern Baptist theologian and New Testament scholar). The book participates in the contemporary revival of biblical theology that emphasizes canonical, christocentric readings of Scripture and engages debates with dispensational, covenantal, and narrative approaches.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The Bible tells one unified story centered on the establishment and display of God's kingship; Jesus is the Davidic King in whom the kingdom promised in Scripture is both inaugurated and guaranteed for final consummation-hence "the King in his beauty" is the theological center of Scripture.
- **Core argument or structure:** the book traces a single redemptive-historical thread across Scripture emphasizing kingship and promise-fulfillment.
 - Creation: God as sovereign King; original ordering and glory of creation.
 - Fall and its consequences: disruption of divine rule and the promise of restoration.
 - Patriarchs and promise: Abrahamic promise as the seed/means by which God will restore his rule.
 - Davidic monarchy and royal promise: Davidic covenant becomes the focal point for hope in a reigning descendant.
 - Prophets and exilic expectation: prophetic expansion of royal themes (justice, reign, eschatological restoration).
 - Jesus as fulfillment: New Testament portrays Jesus as the Davidic King who inaugurates the kingdom, embodies the temple/Word, and fulfills covenantal promises.
 - Consummation: inaugurated eschatology - present reign with future completion when God's kingship is universally displayed.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** interacts broadly with Reformed and evangelical biblical-theologians (e.g., Goldsworthy-style christocentric readings), dialogues implicitly/explicitly with N. T. Wright, G. K. Beale, proponents of dispensationalism, and historical covenant theology; relies on canonical and exegetical NT/OT evidence rather than specialized sociological methods.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Christology**, **kingdom of God/eschatology**, **covenant (Abrahamic & Davidic)**, **typology and fulfillment**, **revelation (canonical focus)**, **soteriology** (in relation to royal rule and atonement), **ecclesiology** (church as kingdom community), and **temple/creation theology**.
- **Closing line:** The Bible's grand narrative culminates in the beauty and reign of the King-Jesus Christ-who mediates God's promised rule now and secures its final consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Puts the motif of **kingship** and the aesthetic notion of the King's "beauty" at the center of biblical theology, linking glory/beauty with royal rule.
 - Balances **inaugurated** and **future** eschatology: the kingdom is truly present in Christ yet awaits consummation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters both **dispensational fragmentation** (sharp Israel/church split) and readings that minimize continuity between Old and New by insisting on covenantal promise-fulfillment in Christ.
 - Offers a corrective to readings that privatize salvation by insisting that soteriology is bound up with cosmic/kingly restoration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Framing biblical history through the image of the King's **beauty** (glory, attractiveness) as well as his **authority**, highlighting aesthetic and moral aspects of divine reign.
 - Emphasizes **royal typology** (Davidic patterns as Christ-figures) within a canonical frame.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Well received in conservative evangelical and Reformed circles as a clear, preacher-friendly biblical theology emphasizing Christocentrism.
 - Used in seminary courses and preaching resources; critiqued by some for relatively limited engagement with critical literary methods and broader historical-theological pluralism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides an accessible, coherent christocentric canonical framework that links OT kingship promises to NT fulfillment-valuable for preachers, teachers, and students seeking a unified biblical storyline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **The King:** Central referent - God revealed and ultimately incarnate in Christ; focal point of biblical unity.
- **Beauty:** The glory and moral attractiveness of God's rule; a thematic nuance linking aesthetics and kingship.
- **Kingdom (of God):** Both present (inaugurated in Christ) and future (consummation); social, cosmic, and soteriological dimensions.
- **Davidic Covenant:** The decisive Old Testament royal promise; schema for understanding Christ's kingship.
- **Promise-Fulfillment:** Canonical hermeneutic - promises in the OT find their completion in Christ and the church.
- **Typology (royal typology):** Use of Davidic and royal figures as foreshadowings whose reality is in Christ.
- **Covenant (Abrahamic/Corporate):** The relational framework linking God's promises to people, land, and dynasty-now fulfilled in the King.
- **Inaugurated Eschatology:** The kingdom is already present in Jesus' person and work but awaits full manifestation.
- **Temple/Presence:** Correlated with kingship; Christ as the locus of God's presence and the true temple.
- **Creation-Fall-Redemption-Consummation:** Overarching historical-theological schema used to situate royal themes.
- **Canonical Reading:** Priority given to the Bible as a unified canon over isolated proof-texting or compartmentalized exegesis.
- **Christocentric Focus:** Methodological rule: Scripture interpreted with Christ as the center and telos.
- **Soteriology as Restoration:** Salvation framed as restoration of God's rule, not merely individual forgiveness.
- **Church as Kingdom Community:** Ecclesiology derived from the King's reign - the church participates in the kingdom's mission.
- **Law and Gospel in Royal Terms:** Law seen as revelation of the King's righteous rule; gospel as initiation of his reign and provision for obedience.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for christocentric, canonical biblical theology emphasizing kingship.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational fragmentation and any reading that divorces Jesus from Israel's royal hopes.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching on OT-NT continuity (especially on Davidic/kingly texts).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking Christology, kingdom theology, and eschatology for pastoral application.
