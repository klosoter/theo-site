### TITLE
**Salvation Belongs to the Lord: An Introduction to Systematic Theology** - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2006 within late-20th/early-21st century Reformed evangelicalism, shaped by Westminster Seminary and Van Tilian presuppositionalism.
 - A catechetical, accessible synthesis intended for church and classroom; complements Frame's larger triad of doctrine volumes.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **The triune Lord sovereignly saves**; theology is the **application of God's word to all of life** under the Lord's authority, control, and covenantal presence.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prolegomena: revelation (general/special), Scripture's authority and inerrancy; knowledge as covenantal obedience; no-neutrality in epistemology.
 - Doctrine of God: Lordship attributes (authority, control, presence); Trinity; attributes and decree; creation and providence.
 - Humanity and sin: image of God, vocation, fall, original sin, total depravity, bondage of the will.
 - Covenant and Christ: covenants (creation/works, grace, redemption), unity of Scripture; person of Christ (two natures, one person); offices of Christ; atonement with penal substitution at center.
 - Salvation applied: union with Christ; effectual calling, regeneration, faith and repentance, justification (imputation; active/passive obedience), adoption, sanctification, perseverance.
 - Church and means: Word and sacraments as **means of grace** (baptism and the Lord's Supper); worship under the Word; prayer; gifts; mission.
 - Last things: personal and general eschatology; return of Christ, resurrection, judgment, new creation; surveys millennial views with pastoral restraint.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture and Reformed confessions; Augustine, Calvin, Westminster divines, Bavinck, Murray, Warfield; Van Til and Kuyper on epistemology and culture.
 - Engages/contrasts: Arminian synergism, Roman Catholic views of justification and sacrament, liberalism, open theism, relativism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; God and Trinity; creation/providence; anthropology; sin; covenant; Christology; soteriology; ecclesiology; worship and sacraments; mission; eschatology.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological reflection culminates in **doxology and discipleship**, for from him and through him and to him are all things.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Tri-perspectivalism** (normative, situational, existential) as integrative method across loci.
 - **Lordship triad** (authority, control, presence) as hermeneutic key for God's relation to creation and salvation.
 - Theology defined as **application**; knowledge is covenantal and ethical, not neutral.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters foundationalism and theological rationalism by insisting on Scripture's primacy and analogical knowledge.
 - Defends compatibilism over libertarian freedom; monergistic grace against synergism.
 - Affirms inerrancy against revisionist bibliologies; rejects open theism's denial of exhaustive foreknowledge.
 - Regulative principle of worship reframed pastorally: governed by Scripture for God's glory and edification, without legalistic reduction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Multiperspectival method; Lordship attributes; covenantal epistemology; ethics of belief.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed churches and seminaries as an accessible, unified primer; bridges academic and pastoral discourse.
 - Appreciated for clarity and charity; debated where it reframes scholastic formulations or worship practice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, coherent Reformed system oriented to **Scripture, church, and life**; a stable reference map for teaching, catechesis, and discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Tri-perspectivalism**: Knowing and obeying God through the normative (Word), situational (world), and existential (self) perspectives.
 - Not three truths but three angles on one truth; mutually implicative.
- **Lordship attributes**: God's **authority** (right to rule), **control** (sovereign power), **presence** (covenantal nearness).
- **Revelation (general/special)**: Creation and conscience reveal God truly; Scripture reveals savingly, culminating in Christ.
- **Inerrancy**: Scripture is wholly true in all it affirms, grounding theological method and ethics.
- **Covenant**: God's sovereignly administered bond with His people; frames redemptive history and doctrine.
- **Analogical knowledge**: True yet creaturely knowledge; we think God's thoughts after Him without collapsing Creator-creature distinction.
- **Providence and decree**: Comprehensive sovereignty compatible with real secondary causes and responsible agency.
- **Imago Dei**: Humanity's created dignity and vocation; basis for ethics and culture; distorted but not destroyed by sin.
- **Total depravity/bondage of the will**: Sin's noetic and moral effects necessitate monergistic grace.
- **Christ's offices**: Prophet, priest, king; unifies revelation, redemption, and rule.
- **Penal substitution**: Christ bears our penalty; grounds justification by imputation.
- **Union with Christ**: Fountainhead of every saving benefit; ordo salutis unfolds from this union.
- **Effectual calling and regeneration**: Spirit's sovereign work producing faith and repentance.
- **Means of grace**: Word, sacraments, prayer as ordained conduits of Christ's benefits.
- **Eschatological hope**: Certain return of Christ, resurrection, judgment, and new creation; already/not-yet pattern.

- **How this work is used**
 - Doctrinal baseline and definitions across loci, especially soteriology and covenant theology.
 - Conceptual pivot: tri-perspectival method applied to exegesis, ethics, worship, and pastoral care.
 - Polemical orientation against synergism, open theism, and revisionist bibliology.
 - Teaching template for catechesis, small groups, and survey courses.
