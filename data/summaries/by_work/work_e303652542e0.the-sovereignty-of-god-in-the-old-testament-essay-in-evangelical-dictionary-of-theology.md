### TITLE
The Sovereignty of God in the Old Testament - Bruce K. Waltke (essay, Evangelical Dictionary of Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical scholarship; Waltke as leading Reformed Old Testament scholar publishing in a broadly evangelical reference work. Engages historical-critical OT scholarship while defending confessional commitments.
 - Milieu: post-Enlightenment biblical studies, renewed debates over providence, foreknowledge, and theodicy within evangelicalism (including responses to open theism and process theology).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament presents **God as sovereign** over creation, history and human agents, yet this sovereignty is exercised covenantally and personally, not as impersonal fatalism. The essay seeks to reconcile divine sovereignty with human responsibility and to address implications for foreknowledge, providence, and the problem of evil.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of key OT texts and motifs that assert divine rule (creation narratives, Exodus, Deuteronomy, Psalms, prophetic texts).
 - Exposition of how covenantal theology frames divine sovereignty: God governs by promise, oath, law and covenant sanctions rather than mere deterministic decree.
 - Distinction between **God's decretive will** (ultimately accomplishing purposes) and **God's preceptive will** (command and moral expectation).
 - Discussion of **divine foreknowledge**: God knows future contingents as certain without negating creaturely freedom; foreknowledge grounds providential action.
 - Treatment of **providence and the problem of evil**: OT provides motifs of divine permission, judicial hardening, and purposes behind suffering; acknowledges mystery while affirming God's moral governance and redemptive intent.
 - Pastoral implications: sovereignty grounds trust, worship and covenant faithfulness amid suffering.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary engagement with canonical OT literature (Genesis-Kings, Psalms, Isaiah, Job, Deuteronomy).
 - Interlocution with Reformed scholastic concepts (divine decree), modern critics (fatalism, open theism), and major OT interpreters (canonical and form-critical perspectives).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Divine sovereignty**, providence, divine foreknowledge, the problem of evil/theodicy, covenant, divine justice and judgment, human responsibility/free will, election and hardening (as OT motifs).

- **Closing line**
 - Waltke locates the OT's center of gravity in a **covenantally exercised sovereignty**: God reigns absolutely yet relationally, accomplishing redemptive purposes while holding creatures morally responsible.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasis on **covenant as the primary matrix** in which OT sovereignty is experienced and proclaimed - sovereignty is relational, legal, and promise-bound rather than abstract metaphysical decree.
 - Balanced theological realism: affirms God's exhaustive control and foreknowledge while taking seriously biblical witness to genuine human agency and moral accountability.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects extremes of deterministic fatalism (which collapses human responsibility) and radical openness/open theism (which limits divine omniscience and providence).
 - Counters reductionist readings that make OT sovereignty only nationalistic or imperialistic by recovering theological and pastoral dimensions.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and insists on a **twofold will** language (decretive vs. preceptive) as exegetically faithful to OT texts and useful for theodicy discussions.
 - Uses canonical-theological method to integrate varied OT genres into a coherent doctrine of sovereignty.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed circles as a measured, textually grounded defense of classical theism regarding providence and foreknowledge.
 - Influential in pastoral theology and introductory systematic treatments of providence.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable exegetical-theological template for teaching OT foundations of providence and responding to modern challenges about divine foreknowledge and the problem of evil.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sovereignty** - God's supreme authority and control over creation and history; presented as covenantal rule in the OT.
- **Providence** - God's ongoing governance of creatures and events; distinguished from micromanaging fatalism.
- **Foreknowledge** - God's exhaustive knowledge of future events and decisions; affirmed without denying creaturely freedom.
- **Decretive will** - The aspect of God's will by which his purposes are ultimately accomplished.
- **Preceptive will** - God's moral commands and expectations toward creatures; ground of covenant accountability.
- **Covenant** - The relational-legal framework through which sovereignty is exercised and understood in the OT.
- **Anthropopathism** - Use of human emotions/terms for God; Waltke emphasizes its interpretive caution in discussing divine response and change.
- **Judicial hardening** - OT motif where God confirms a course of action as judgment; used to account for divine responsibility and human culpability.
- **Permissive will** - God allowing human evil within broader providential purposes; helps address the problem of evil.
- **Moral governance** - God as moral ruler who judges and redeems rather than a neutral cosmic force.
- **Mystery** - Admission that some tensions (evil, suffering, specific divine purposes) remain beyond full human comprehension.
- **Redemptive intent** - Sovereignty is oriented toward covenantal promises and ultimate restoration in salvation history.
- **Creaturely freedom** - Affirmation that human choices are genuine and morally significant within divine sovereignty.
- **Canonical-theological method** - Reading OT genres and texts as unified witness to God's sovereignty.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for deriving doctrine of providence from canonical OT texts.
 - As a **polemic resource** against open theism and determinist distortions.
 - As a **definition source** in evangelical syllabi for linking OT motifs to systematic categories (foreknowledge, providence, theodicy).
 - As a **pastoral/conceptual pivot** for preaching on suffering, divine governance and trust.
