### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (ed. Brian Davies & Eleonore Stump) - comprehensive contemporary essays on Thomas Aquinas integrating historical scholarship with analytic theology

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published in the early 21st century amid a revival of Thomistic scholarship and the rise of analytic theology. Editors bring analytic clarity to medieval sources, situating Aquinas within both medieval scholasticism and contemporary doctrinal debates.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** No single thesis (essay collection). Unified aim: to show Aquinas as a coherent, philosophically rigorous theological system capable of addressing enduring questions about God, creation, sin, providence, the Trinity, and the Holy Spirit - and to test his resources against modern disputes (e.g., open theism, Pentecostalism, Van Tilian language critiques).
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: Metaphysics of God - essence/existence, analogy of being, and the divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - Part II: God-world relations - creation, contingency, providence, and counterfactuals (including "what if Adam had not sinned" thought-experiments).
 - Part III: Moral and soteriological matters - sin (guilt, pollution, death), theodicy, and divine justice.
 - Part IV: Trinity and language - personhood language, analogical predication, and responses to Van Til's one‑person critique.
 - Part V: Pneumatology and reception - the Holy Spirit, charismatic claims, and Reformed/Pentecostal dialogues.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, Summa Contra Gentiles), Aristotle, Augustine, Pseudo-Dionysius, medieval commentators; contemporary interlocutors include proponents of open theism, Van Til-influenced apologists, Pentecostal theologians, and analytic philosophers.
- **Doctrines treated:** Theology Proper (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, absol/relative attributes), Doctrine of Sin (original guilt, pollution, death), Pneumatology (Spirit, charismatic gifts), Trinity (personhood language), Theodicy and divine justice, divine condescension/kenosis, and counterfactual creation scenarios.
- **Closing line:** The volume treats Aquinas as a living resource: his systematic metaphysics and analogue-of-being framework remain a central, testable toolkit for modern doctrinal and philosophical-theological problems.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Renewed focus on Aquinas' **essence-existence distinction** as foundational for God's aseity and contingency of creatures.
 - Careful analytic reconstructions of **divine simplicity** that separate theological affirmations from naïve metaphysical misunderstandings.
 - Treatment of **absolute vs relative attributes**: how predicates apply to God in absolute (intrinsic) vs relative (created relation) senses.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Clarifies differences with Augustinian voluntarism and with later Scotist critiques; offers responses to open theism by appeal to Aquinas' account of providence, knowledge of counterfactuals, and timeless causation.
 - Engages Van Til's insistence on one-person language, offering Thomistic defenses of analogical Trinitarian language.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Analytic framings of medieval notions (e.g., reformulating impassibility and immutability using contemporary modal and temporal language).
 - Use of counterfactual semantics to handle Aquinas' dispositional claims (e.g., hypothetical integrity of Adam's state).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Reformed reception is mixed historically but increasingly positive in recent analytic-theological circles; the handbook facilitates constructive appropriation (e.g., on providence and theodicy) while also surfacing tensions (original guilt, sacramental theology).
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Consolidates interpretive pathways for teaching Aquinas to analytic theologians and advanced students; serves as both introduction and advanced reference for applying Thomistic resources to contemporary debates.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity:** God's lack of metaphysical parts; essays refine how attributes are identical to divine essence without collapsing theology into unintelligibility.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; treated as grounded in the essence-existence distinction and as key to providence and creation.
- **Immutability & Impassibility:** Distinct defenses of non-change and non-suffering in God, restated in modal/temporal vocabulary to answer modern concerns.
- **Analogy of Being (analogia entis):** Central hermeneutic for talk about God; mediates univocity and equivocity.
- **Absolute vs Relative Attributes:** Clarifies predicates like omnipotence or goodness when said absolutely (in God) versus relationally (toward creatures).
- **Guilt, Pollution, and Death (Original Sin):** Aquinas' distinctions between inherited guilt, privation of original justice, and mortality; essays connect these to forensic and ontological accounts.
- **Counterfactuals & Adam's Hypothetical Integrity:** Use of counterfactual reasoning to evaluate "what if Adam had not sinned" scenarios and implications for providence and natural law.
- **Open Theism & Divine Condescension:** Thomistic responses emphasize middle knowledge, timeless divine knowledge, and forms of condescension compatible with immutability.
- **Van Til's One‑Person Language Critique:** Examinations of Trinitarian language; Thomistic analogical person-language defended against charges of modalism or functional reductionism.
- **Pneumatology & Pentecostal-Reformed Dialogue:** Thomistic accounts of the Spirit used to critique or resource charismatic claims; emphasis on habitual/granted gifts and ecclesial mediation.
- **Theodicy & Divine Justice:** Aquinas' moral metaphysics used to articulate a theodical framework where evil is privation and divine justice is metaphysically ordered.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for key Thomistic terms (simplicity, essence/existence).
- As a **polemic resource** against open theism and simplistic readings of Trinitarian language.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Aquinas into contemporary debates on sin, providence, and pneumatology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in course syllabi and research that bridge medieval metaphysics and analytic theology.
