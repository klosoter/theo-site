### TITLE
The Offices of Christ (lectures and essays)
Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Dutch Reformed theology. Bavinck writes from the neo-Calvinist milieu associated with Abraham Kuyper but maintains a more classical Reformed dogmatic method; addresses academy, clergy, and church in a period of theological contest with liberalism, modern biblical criticism, and Roman Catholic claims.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christ is the one Mediator who fulfills the threefold office (munus triplex) of Prophet, Priest, and King; these offices are distinct in function but unified in the one person of the incarnate Son, and they form the structure for understanding revelation, redemption, and rule.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exposition of the three offices as biblical and creedal categories, tracing scriptural proof-texts and typology (Moses/Aaron/King motifs).
 - Christ as **Prophet**: authoritative revelation of God in word and deed; continuity with Old Testament prophecy and finality of divine revelation in the incarnate Logos.
 - Christ as **Priest**: vicarious sacrifice, satisfaction and substitution, intercession, and ongoing mediation before the Father; treatment of active/passive obedience and of the covenantal representative function.
 - Christ as **King**: present lordship and eschatological reign; exercise of authority in church and cosmos, real but not yet consummated kingdom; implication for church order and public life.
 - Synthetic chapters showing interplay: how revelation grounds atonement and rule; how atonement secures dominion; how kingly rule gives effect to prophetic word and priestly reconciliation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** heavy engagement with Reformation (Calvin), medieval and scholastic categories (with critique), contemporary neo-Calvinist thought (Kuyper), and polemics against Roman Catholic sacerdotalism and liberal reductionism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and natures), Trinity (economic and immanent relations), covenant theology (representation and headship), atonement (satisfaction/substitution), soteriology, revelation, ecclesiology, sacraments, eschatology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The threefold office names the comprehensive mediation of the incarnate Son: he **reveals**, **redeems**, and **rules** as one divine Mediator, grounding doctrine and life in the covenantal person of Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced integration of biblical, historical, and systematic method:** Bavinck combines careful exegesis with patristic/Reformation history and dogmatic synthesis rather than one-dimensional apologetics.
- **Covenantal-personal emphasis:** Offices are treated not as abstract functions but as offices exercised by the one covenantal Mediator in his personal union of natures.
- **Correction to extremes:**
 - Against Roman sacerdotalism: rejects any independent, sacerdotal power apart from Christ's unique priesthood and the church's instituted ministry.
 - Against liberal reductions: resists reducing Christ to ethical teacher or purely spiritual exemplar; insists on atoning, objective work.
 - Against crude tripartite separations: stresses unity of the person of Christ even while distinguishing functions.
- **Terminological clarity:** Careful delimitation of munus (office) vs. beneficium (benefit), and of priestly sacrifice vs. priestly intercession.
- **Pastoral and ecclesial application:** Draws implications for preaching, sacramental practice, ministry, and Christian social life-linking doctrine to church structure and public witness.
- **Reception and influence:** Highly regarded in Reformed dogmatics as a model treatment of the munus triplex; influential for subsequent Reformed systematicians and pastors seeking a biblically rooted, catholic, and confessional Christology.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact pedagogical and homiletical resource-useful for teaching Christology, preaching the offices, and defending classical Reformed formulations against modern distortions.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Munus triplex (threefold office):** The organizing principle-Prophet, Priest, King-as functions of Christ's mediation.
- **Prophet:** Christ as final revelation; authoritative interpretation of Scripture and embodiment of divine Word.
 - Relation to apostolic preaching and the church's proclamation.
- **Priest:** Christ as sacrificer and mediator; satisfaction/substitution and ongoing intercession.
 - Distinguishes passive obedience (suffered atonement) and active obedience (law-fulfilling righteousness).
- **King:** Christ's lordship; present rule through Spirit and church, consummated eschatological reign.
 - Includes both personal sovereignty and public/social implications.
- **Hypostatic Union:** Basis for unity of offices-one person with two natures performs all three offices.
- **Mediator:** Central role tying together offices; representation, federal headship, and access to the Father.
- **Covenant representation / federal head:** Christ as covenantal head for elect, grounding imputation and corporate solidarity.
- **Atonement vocabulary:** satisfaction, substitution, expiation, reconciliation-Bavinck affirms penal-substitutional contours while integrating relational and covenantal language.
- **Active and passive obedience:** Distinguishes Christ's lawful fulfillment and his suffering/penal work as both necessary for justification and sanctification.
- **Revelation (Word and Sacrament):** Prophetic office realized in preaching and sacraments as means of grace.
- **Sacerdotal critique:** Rejection of sacerdotal mediation in the church that eclipses Christ's unique priesthood.
- **Eschatological fulfillment:** Kingly office points toward consummation; present reign is real but not yet final.
- **Church and ministry:** Offices inform ecclesiastical order-ministry as participation in Christ's offices, but derivative and functional.
- **Intercession:** Ongoing priestly work of Christ ensuring access and advocacy before the Father.

How the work is used:
- As a **definition source** for munus triplex within Reformed dogmatics.
- As a **polemic** against Roman Catholic sacerdotal claims and liberal reductions of Christ.
- As an **exegetical-model** for deriving doctrinal conclusions from typology and covenantal reading.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Christology to ecclesiology, sacramentology, and public theology.
