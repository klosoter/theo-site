### TITLE
**"Presbyterian Church Government" - Guy Prentiss Waters (contributor), The Handbook of Presbyterian Church Government**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed pastoral and academic milieu (late 20th-early 21st century); written for denominational leaders, seminarians, and courts seeking concise, historically informed guidance.
 - Positioned within the broader Protestant and Reformed conversation about polity: reacting to both congregational voluntarism and episcopal centralization.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Presbyterian government is the faithful, biblical expression of Christ's headship over the covenant community via ordered, representative ministry and mutual jurisdictional accountability. The chief problem addressed is how the church can be both local and connectional while remaining biblically accountable and pastorally effective.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical foundations: exegesis of key texts (1 Timothy 3; Titus 1; Acts 15; Matthew 18) to ground plurality of elders and courts.
 - Theological grounding: covenant theology and Christology that locate authority in Christ, exercised through offices and courts by representation.
 - Ecclesial architecture:
 - Local court: **Session** (ruling and teaching elders) - worship, sacraments, local discipline.
 - Regional court: **Presbytery** - ordination, oversight, mission coordination.
 - Intermediate/General courts: **Synod / General Assembly** - doctrinal adjudication, inter-church relations.
 - Practical application: ordination, installation, calls, and discipline procedures; constitutional polity and the use of confessions and Book of Order equivalents.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical Reformed sources: Calvin, Knox, Westminster Standards; also appeals to subsequent Presbyterian constitutionalism and contemporary denominational practice.
 - Interlocutors: congregationalists and episcopalians (contrasts), modern ecclesiologists concerned with congregational autonomy and clericalism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology (chief), with attendant emphases on covenant, Christology (Christ as head), authority, ministry, sacraments in their communal context, and pastoral theology (discipline and restoration).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Presbyterian polity is a covenantal, representative ordering of the church that seeks to embody Christ's pastoral headship through plural eldership and graded courts for the church's purity, unity, and mission.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong linking of polity to covenant theology: offices and courts are not merely pragmatic but sacramental/representational of covenant faithfulness.
 - Balanced portrayal of **parity** among elders with functional distinction (teaching vs ruling), avoiding both clerical supremacy and lay egalitarian reduction.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects clericalist readings that elevate ministers above elders; counters congregationalist sketches that atomize the local church and erode mutual accountability.
 - Reframes "polity as law" into polity as pastoral and theological-jurisdiction serves restoration and doctrine, not mere bureaucracy.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies language around **delegated authority** and **derived jurisdiction**: courts act on behalf of the church under Christ, not as autonomous power centers.
 - Emphasizes **representational ministry** - elders as covenant representatives rather than simply functionaries.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminary courses and denominational training; cited in polity handbooks across PCA, OPC, and other Reformed bodies.
 - Valued by committees drafting constitutions and discipline manuals for bringing theological clarity to procedural questions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, theologically robust primer linking biblical exegesis, confessional standards, and practical procedures; useful for pastors, sessions, and judicatory leaders.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elder (presbyter)** - biblical office; plurality governs local church.
- **Teaching elder** - minister/pastor who proclaims Word and administers sacraments.
- **Ruling elder** - lay eldership responsible for governance, pastoral care, and discipline alongside minister.
- **Session** - local court composed of elders; oversees worship, discipline, and membership.
- **Presbytery** - regional judicatory; ordination, oversight, conflict resolution between congregations.
- **Synod / General Assembly** - higher courts for appeals, doctrine, inter-church relations.
- **Ordination** - ecclesial act of setting apart; viewed as recognition of call and confessional conformity, not magical transmission of power.
- **Call** - procedure by which a congregation invites a teaching elder; mediated by courts.
- **Discipline** - pastoral and juridical process aimed at repentance, restoration, and purity of the church.
- **Covenant community** - theological locus: polity functions within covenantal identity and obligations.
- **Representational ministry** - elders act as corporate representatives under Christ.
- **Jurisdiction / delegated authority** - authority exercised by courts as delegated from Christ via the covenant people.
- **Parity vs. distinction** - equality of office among elders with differing functions (teaching/ruling).
- **Constitutional/confessional authority** - place of standards (e.g., Westminster) in guiding judicatory decisions.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for courses and manuals explaining Presbyterian structures and their theological rationale.
 - As a **practical model** for drafting ordination, call, and discipline procedures in denominational constitutions.
 - As a **polemic resource** against congregationalist and episcopal models by appealing to biblical and confessional argumentation.
 - As an **exegetical-conceptual pivot** linking specific biblical texts to institutional forms (eldership, courts, discipline).
