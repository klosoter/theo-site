### TITLE
The Case for Calvinism - Cornelius Van Til 
Brief: A systematic defense of Reformed (Calvinist) theology as the only philosophically and theologically coherent Christian worldview; foundational statement of presuppositional apologetics and the theological integration of epistemology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed apologetic reaction against evidentialism, liberal theology, and rationalistic compromises; rooted in Dutch Reformed tradition and Westminster circles.
 - Van Til writes as a systematic theologian-apologist seeking a unified apologetic and doctrinal method for covenantal Reformed faith.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Calvinism supplies the only ultimate presupposition for intelligible Christian thought: God as sovereign, self-revealing, covenant Lord. Non-Christian systems lack the necessary transcendental grounding for logic, morals, and human experience.
 - Problem: how to justify Christian truth-claims without uncritically transferring non-Christian presuppositions into theology.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Expose the non-neutrality of reason: all reasoning rests on ultimate commitments or presuppositions.
 - Show the **antithesis** between Christian and non-Christian thought-mutual exclusivity at root convictions.
 - Offer a **transcendental argument**: only the Christian God makes possible the preconditions of intelligible experience (laws of logic, uniformity, moral norms).
 - Apply to doctrinal loci (e.g., church, Spirit, Christology) to demonstrate doctrinal coherence and pastoral consequence.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Augustine, Calvin, Kuyper for Reformed resources; critiques contemporary evidentialists and rationalists (e.g., Gordon Clark-style critics and liberal theology tendencies).
 - Engages opponents methodologically more than purely exegetically.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority and epistemology); Trinity (including Spirit as divine witness and epistemic agent); Christology (Hypostatic Union as revelation of God); Covenant theology; Church and Kingdom (ecclesiology and eschatology); human sinfulness and total depravity as epistemic condition.

- **Selected topical treatments**
 - **Church and Kingdom:** interprets the church as covenantal, visible witness to the Kingdom; emphasizes the church's role in maintaining the Christian presuppositional stance against worldly thought.
 - **Person and Deity of the Holy Spirit:** underscores the Spirit as divine agent of revelation and conviction; the Spirit is epistemically central-enabler of true knowledge and unity with Christ.
 - **Hypostatic Union:** affirms Chalcedonian doctrine and insists the union secures the possibility of God speaking truly in Christ; Christ is both the ontological and epistemic mediator of divine knowledge.

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til locates the theological center of gravity in the sovereignty of God as the necessary presupposition for intelligible Christian thought and faithful witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on *presuppositions* as decisive: theology prescribes the ultimate commitments for rationality, not vice versa.
 - Antithesis formulated as pervasive and epistemic, not merely ethical.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects evidentialist apologetics that attempt neutral proof; opposes any claim of an autonomous, neutral human reason.
 - Challenges Clarkian rationalism by arguing for the necessity of the triune God as the grounding of logic rather than abstract axioms.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic deployment of the *transcendental argument for God* within a Reformed framework.
 - Integration of covenantal thinking into epistemology-knowledge as covenantal relation mediated by the Spirit and Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for 20th-21st century Reformed apologetics (Bahnsen, Frame, others); controversial among more moderate evangelicals and analytic philosophers.
 - Reinvigorated interest in theological epistemology and the role of the church in apologetic strategy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous integration of doctrine and epistemology; sharpens awareness of worldview presuppositions; valuable for teaching apologetics, systematic theology, and ecclesial formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - Method: all argument begins with biblical presuppositions; non-Christian systems are internally inconsistent.
- **Transcendental argument** - Claim: the preconditions of intelligibility (logic, morals, uniformity) presuppose the triune God.
- **Antithesis** - Radical, pervasive opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought-worlds.
- **Sovereignty of God** - Foundational presupposition securing knowledge, history, and covenant life.
- **Covenant** - Framework binding doctrinal, ecclesial, and epistemic claims; church exists as covenant sign and witness.
- **Revelation / Scripture** - Ultimate authority and norm; epistemic rule for interpreting facts and reasoning.
- **Holy Spirit (Person & Deity)** - Divine epistemic agent who illumines, convicts, and unites believers to Christ; essential for real knowledge of God.
- **Hypostatic Union** - Chalcedonian union affirmed and used apophatically: Christ's united natures render divine self-disclosure intelligible and normative.
- **Total depravity** - Epistemic implications: sin corrupts reason and necessitates divine renewal for true knowledge.
- **Common grace (qualified)** - Explains orderly aspects of non-Christian thought while denying its ultimate epistemic legitimacy.
- **Non-neutrality of reason** - Denies any point of ultimate neutrality for human cognition.
- **Kingdom / Church distinction** - Kingdom as God's rule (present/eschatological); church as covenantal agent and visible community.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for presuppositional apologetics and Reformed epistemology.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialism, liberal theology, and rationalistic neutrality.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian, Christological, and ecclesiological doctrine to epistemological method in teaching and systematics.
