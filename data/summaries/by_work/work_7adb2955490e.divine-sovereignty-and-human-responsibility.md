### TITLE
Divine Sovereignty and Human Responsibility - D. A. Carson (editor and contributor). 
Edited evangelical volume that gathers biblical-theological treatments of providence, predestination, human agency, and culpability; prominent in late 20th-century Reformed-evangelical discussions.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical engagement with classical debates between Calvinism and Arminianism. Written amid renewed interest in biblical exegesis of texts bearing on providence, election, and human freedom.
 - Carson represents an evangelical, broadly Reformed scholarly posture emphasizing careful exegesis over systematic abstraction.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture teaches both robust divine sovereignty and genuine human responsibility; the relationship is a theological tension not solved by facile system-building. The chief task is faithful exegesis and pastoral appropriation rather than philosophical reconciliation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of key biblical passages that raise the problem (e.g., Exodus 4-9; Romans 9; Acts 2; James 1; Deuteronomy narratives).
 - Methodological insistence: prioritize historical-grammatical exegesis, semantic range of verbs (e.g., "harden," "choose," "foreknew"), and canonical-theological coherence.
 - Critique of extremes:
 - Against deterministic readings that erase genuine agency and moral culpability.
 - Against libertarian readings that make divine foreknowledge merely passive and undermine decree.
 - Proposes a mitigated compatibilist posture: God decrees and ordains without abrogating genuine human decisions and moral responsibility; acknowledges mystery where texts remain irreducibly paradoxical.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical sources: Augustine, Calvin, Jonathan Edwards (themes and resources).
 - Contemporary interlocutors: Arminian critics, hyper-Calvinist tendencies, and proponents of Molinism (middle knowledge).
 - Contributors to the volume include a range of evangelical scholars; Carson interacts with them and frames the debate.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Providence, divine decree, predestination/election, foreknowledge, human freedom (compatibilist vs. libertarian), sin and culpability, reprobation, divine permission of evil, soteriology and justification implications.
 - Substantive exegetical treatment across OT and NT texts.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers the conviction that the Bible simultaneously affirms sovereign divine governance and real human responsibility; responsible theology disciplines both doctrinal fidelity and exegetical humility.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Relentless commitment to close exegesis and the semantic nuance of biblical language rather than philosophical resolution.
 - Presentation of the problem as a sustained biblical tension to be held rather than a riddle to be solved.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects hyper-Calvinist tendencies that nullify human culpability and evangelistic urgency.
 - Counters Arminian reductions that make divine sovereignty derivative of creaturely freedom.
 - Marks a middle path distinct from full Molinist "middle knowledge" construction, preferring scriptural witness over systematizing metaphysics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Framing the debate as "biblical perspectives in tension" - a methodological banner that legitimizes paradox as an interpretive posture.
 - Attentive parsing of Hebrew and Greek verbs related to willing, hardening, and foreknowing to avoid theological overreach.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a model of balanced, text-driven engagement.
 - Influenced subsequent treatments that emphasize pastoral consequences of the doctrine (evangelism, assurance, pastoral care).
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches students to resist either/or reductions and to read contentious proof texts with linguistic, historical, and canonical sensitivity.
 - Serves as a durable classroom resource for presenting the debate without polemical caricature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine sovereignty** - God's supreme rule and decree; affirmed as dispositive of history without denying creaturely involvement.
- **Providence** - God's continuous governance; distinguishes between ordering, permitting, and sustaining.
- **Predestination / election** - God's choosing in salvation; exegetically grounded (Romans, Ephesians).
- **Foreknowledge** - biblical usage debated; Carson stresses relational/intentional dimensions, not merely chronological foresight.
- **Compatibilism** - view generally favored methodologically: human choices are authentically culpable yet occur under divine decree.
- **Libertarian freedom** - contrasted and critiqued where it undermines divine ordination; acknowledged for moral intuition but judged exegetically problematic.
- **Middle knowledge (Molinism)** - canvassed as an alternative; Carson treats it respectfully but does not adopt it as the default exegetical solution.
- **Hardening / divine decrees to harden** - analyzed via Exodus and Pauline texts; emphasis on corporate and judicial functions.
- **Permission (of evil)** - God permits human sin within providential purposes; distinction between causation and permissive ordination.
- **Culpability / moral responsibility** - maintained robustly: divine sovereignty does not remove human guilt or the need for repentance.
- **Reprobation** - discussed alongside election; treated carefully to avoid deterministic or fatalistic readings.
- **Mystery / tension** - methodological key term: admits unresolved depths in Scripture that warrant humility.
- **Biblical exegesis as method** - repeated emphasis: scripture-led conclusions over metaphysical systems.
- **Pastoral implications** - evangelism, assurance, lament, and accountability derive from maintaining both sovereignty and responsibility.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for balanced Reformed positions that insist on both divine rule and human obligation.
 - As a **polemic resource** against both hyper-Calvinism and reductionist Arminianism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading "hardening" and Romans 9-type texts with nuance and canonical sensitivity.
