### TITLE
"Christ the Only Savior of Interpretation" - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal 38 (1976): article-length study arguing for a distinctly Christocentric hermeneutic within a Reformed theological horizon. Cites the broader discussion under the rubric **Christ And Culture In Eschatological Perspective**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-1970s Reformed academy reacting to historical-critical methods, pluralistic hermeneutics, and renewed interest in Christocentric readings (parallel to post-war Christ-and-culture debates).
 - Poythress writes from a conservative Reformed vantage seeking to integrate rigorous exegesis with doctrinal Christology and pneumatology.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Christ is the indispensable and authoritative center of legitimate interpretation** - not merely one theme among others but the controlling principle that makes interpretation salvific and true.
- **Core argument / major moves**
 - Define interpretation as an act that requires a normative center; show the insufficiency of purely autonomous or neutral interpretive methods.
 - Argue that the incarnate Word (Christ) and the written Word (Scripture) uniquely authorize and enable right understanding; the Holy Spirit applies Christ as Interpreter to readers.
 - Defend a Christocentric hermeneutic against both liberal symbolic pluralism and rigid literalism; propose typological and covenantal tools for reading Scripture Christologically.
 - Connect hermeneutics to soteriology: correct interpretation is made possible by the saving work of Christ (and the Spirit), hence Christ is the "savior" of interpretation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit critique of historical-critical and secular hermeneutical approaches that detach text from Christocentric confession.
 - Dialogue with general Christ-and-culture literature (eschatological perspectives) and with confessional Reformed commitments; resonates with Barthian emphasis on Christ as center but framed within Reformed doctrinal commitments.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (central), **revelation** (incarnate and written), **pneumatology** (Spirit as interpreter), **soteriology** (interpretive salvation), **Trinity** (relation of Father, Son, Spirit in revelation), and hermeneutics/typology.
- **Closing line / theological center of gravity**
 - Interpretation is not epistemologically neutral: true understanding is mediated by the incarnate Word and Spirit, so Christ is the only ultimate guarantor and guide of authentic interpretation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Pithy formulation of a "soteriology of interpretation": interpretation itself is an aspect of redemption - Christ rescues not only sinners but their interpretive faculties and the legitimacy of reading.
 - Strong insistence on the ontological primacy of the incarnate Word over methodological pluralism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Pushes back against neutral, method-centered hermeneutics (including some historical-critical practice) that presume human autonomy in meaning-making.
 - Differs from Barthian one-sided critiques by insisting on confessional, canon-aware exegesis rather than abstract dogmatic Christocentrism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of the phrase **"savior of interpretation"** as a heuristic to relate Christology directly to hermeneutics.
 - Integration of typology and covenant thought into hermeneutical methodology as Christ-directed reading tools.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear warrant for Christ-centered preaching and biblical theology.
 - Cited in later discussions that seek to defend canonical, Christocentric reading against postmodern and secular hermeneutics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies why Christology must shape methods of interpretation; useful for sermon preparation, theological exegesis, and defenses of confessional reading practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christocentric hermeneutic** - reading Scripture with Christ as the controlling interpretive key.
- **Savior of interpretation** - Poythress's shorthand: Christ enables and guarantees true understanding.
- **Incarnate Word / Written Word** - relationship between Jesus (Word made flesh) and Scripture (Word written) as dual loci of authoritative revelation.
- **Spirit as interpreter** - the Holy Spirit applies Christ to readers, enabling legitimate comprehension.
- **Typology** - reading earlier texts as divinely ordained foreshadowings fulfilled in Christ; a preferred method in Poythress's model.
- **Covenantal reading** - interpreting texts within the covenantal economy that centers on Christ's person and work.
- **Hermeneutical authority** - the source that validates interpretation (for Poythress: Christ and the Spirit, not autonomous method).
- **Eschatological perspective** - situating interpretation within the already/not-yet of Christ's reign; shapes Christ-and-culture implications.
- **Hermeneutical circle** - reformed account: Christ and canonical faith inform initial understanding which in turn refines reading; not vicious relativism.
- **Polemic vs neutral method** - Poythress distinguishes normative theological presuppositions from pretended neutrality.
- **Soteriology of knowledge** - idea that redemption includes restoration of faculties for truth.
- **Canonical priority** - Scripture as final norm shaped by Christ's revelation.
- **Exegesis integrated with dogmatics** - exegetical conclusions must cohere with confessional Christology.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for Christocentric hermeneutics and the phrase "savior of interpretation."
- As a **polemic** against secular/historical-critical neutrality and pluralistic interpretive frameworks.
- As an **exegetical model** for preaching and biblical theology that insists on typology, covenantal reading, and pneumatological dependence.
