### TITLE
The Oxford Handbook of Sacramental Theology - ed. Hans Boersma & Matthew Levering

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary, ecumenical handbook format synthesizing late 20th-21st century retrievalist trends in sacramental theology. Operates within a renewed patristic and high-church retrieval movement that resists modernist and purely symbolic accounts of the sacraments.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** There is no single thesis across the volume, but a sustained concerted attempt to reconceive sacraments as constitutive, ontologically effective events that disclose and mediate the triune God's presence - against reductionist memorialist or purely functionalist models.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Historical surveys (patristic, medieval, Reformation, modern) to show continuity and rupture.
 - Biblical-theological essays tracing sacramental motifs in Scripture.
 - Systematic chapters developing sacramental ontology, presence, and participation.
 - Liturgical, pastoral, and ecumenical treatments addressing practice, lived worship, and inter-confessional dialogue.
 - Treatises on specific rites: baptism, Eucharist, ordination, reconciliation, anointing, plus broader notions of sacramentality (creation, art, culture).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture; Augustine, Gregory, Aquinas; Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli); moderns such as Barth, Rahner, Balthasar, Torrance; contemporary sacramentalists and ecumenists. Interacts with phenomenology, liturgical studies, and sacramental psychology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity, Christology (presence and incarnation), ecclesiology (church as sacrament), grace, creation (sacramentality of creation), eschatology (eschatological horizon of sacramental promise), liturgy, sacraments/rites, anthropology (participation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** The volume advances a recovered sacramental realism: sacraments are not mere symbols but participatory, incarnational manifestations of the triune God's saving presence, rooting ecclesial life in a sacramental ontology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Persistent advocacy of **sacramental ontology** - the claim that the created order is ordered to and participates in divine realities via instituted rites.
 - Integration of patristic metaphors (mystery, sacramentum) with modern analytic and phenomenological tools.
 - Emphasis on the Eucharist as locus of ecclesial identity and theosis/participation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushback against 19th-20th century liberal and memorialist reductions (sacraments as mere signs, moral exhortation, or sociological rites).
 - Offers a corrective to purely institutional or legalistic accounts by stressing mystery, participation, and liturgical embodiment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Re-deployment of "sacramentality" beyond the seven-sacrament schema to include creation, political and artistic forms as loci of God's self-disclosure.
 - Nuanced mapping of "presence" terminology to cover multiple senses (real presence, spiritual presence, anamnetic presence) rather than a single formula.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in academic and seminary contexts as a multi-perspective reference; influential in ecumenical conversations and in renewed Anglo-Catholic and Catholic-Protestant sacramental thinking.
 - Critiques center on editorial tilt toward sacramental realism and uneven representation of dissenting symbolicist voices.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Comprehensive, interdisciplinary, and ecumenically attuned resource for historical grounding, systematic development, and practical theology curricula.
 - Stimulates fresh research agendas on sacramentality of culture and ecumenical reconciliation over sacramental doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament / sacramentum:** Instituted sign that both signifies and effects what it signifies; central unit of analysis.
- **Sacramentality:** Broad category for instances where created realities mediate divine life (includes sacraments, sacramentals, creation).
- **Real presence:** Spectrum of accounts (ontological/physical, spiritual, symbolic-anamnetic); the Handbook maps and evaluates each sense.
 - Contrast: transubstantiation, consubstantiation, concomitance, spiritual presence, memorial presence.
- **Efficacy (ex opere operato vs. participatory efficacy):** Discussion ranges from classical juridical formulas to relational/participatory models of how grace is mediated.
- **Participation / theosis:** Not merely moral imitation but ontological sharing in Christ's life; sacrament as means of participation in divine life.
- **Mystery / sacramental mystery:** Emphasis on apophatic and doxological dimensions; sacraments as liturgical openings into hidden divine reality.
- **Liturgy / liturgical theology:** Sacraments understood primarily as liturgical acts embedded in communal worship and time.
- **Baptism & Eucharist:** Treated as foundational sacraments structuring Christian identity; baptism marks incorporation, Eucharist constitutes ongoing incorporation and communion.
- **Ordination / holy orders:** Examined ecclesiologically and sacramentally, including debates over ontological change vs. functional mandate.
- **Sacramentals:** Objects/practices that participate in sacramentality without being sacraments proper.
- **Creation as sacrament:** Argument that the world discloses God and is capable of sacramental mediation.
- **Presence vocabulary:** Epiphany, mediation, signification - helps distinguish modes of divine self-disclosure.
- **Ecumenical hermeneutic:** Practical framework for reading contested doctrines across traditions toward mutual intelligibility.

- **How the work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional and conceptual source** for seminaries teaching sacramental theology and liturgical theology.
 - As a **polemic and resource** against memorialist or reductionist sacramental accounts in doctrinal debates.
 - As an **exegetical and historical model** for integrating Scriptural, patristic, medieval, and Reformation data into systematic sacramental claims.
