### TITLE
**Perfectionism - B. B. Warfield**

---

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton-Reformed milieu; Warfield writing from conservative Presbyterian scholarship in reaction to the Holiness/Wesleyan revivalist movement.
 - Intersects modern debates on sanctification, revival experience, and the psychology of sin during a period of increased evangelical popular piety.

- **Central thesis**
 - Warfield argues that Christian "perfectionism" (the claim that *sinless perfection* can be attained in this life by an instantaneous act of grace) is theologically untenable, historically akin to Pelagian error, and incompatible with biblical anthropology; true sanctification is progressive and depends on ongoing grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definitions: clarifies what proponents mean by "perfection" (eradication of inward sin vs. outward holiness).
 - Biblical exegesis: reads Pauline and Johannine texts (esp. those on the flesh, concupiscence, and the Christian's continuing struggle) against perfectionist glosses.
 - Historical-theological critique: traces affinities between perfectionism and tendencies in Pelagian / semi-Pelagian thought; contrasts with Augustinian/Reformed doctrines of original sin and inability.
 - Psychological and ethical analysis: argues moral psychology shows persistence of indwelling sin; instantaneous eradication is incoherent with observed Christian experience.
 - Pastoral implications: warns that claims of absolute present perfection distort assurance and misunderstand justification.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Principal interlocutors: John Wesley and the Wesleyan-Holiness tradition, various 19th-century holiness authors.
 - Engages Augustine and Reformation exegetes (Calvin), and critiques Pelagius and semi-Pelagian formulations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Nature and origin of sin; freedom of the will and its bondage; total depravity and inability; justification vs sanctification; definitive vs progressive sanctification; ecclesial and pastoral consequences.

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the debate on the persistence of the sinful principle and insists that sound doctrine preserves both the radicality of grace and the reality of ongoing sanctification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Unflinching insistence on the continued presence of indwelling sin (concupiscence) even in regenerate persons.
 - Emphasizes the *impossibility of moral self-recovery* apart from continual divine grace - i.e., denial of instant, complete moral power-transforming in this life.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Treats Wesleyan "entire sanctification" as functionally Pelagian: not merely a competing tradition but one that undermines doctrines of original sin and inability.
 - Restores an Augustinian/Reformed account that keeps justification and sanctification distinct while tightly related.

- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Clarifies the distinction between *definitive* (positional/juridical) and *progressive* (experiential/ethical) sanctification in polemical contexts.
 - Reframes perfectionism as a systematic error arising from a faulty anthropology rather than merely a pietistic excess.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian responses to the Holiness movement; standard reference for critics of Wesleyan perfectionism.
 - Less persuasive within Wesleyan and Holiness circles, but engaged by later systematicians as a forceful historical-theological critique.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of close historical-theological argumentation linking anthropology and soteriology.
 - Valuable for teaching the interplay of original sin, free will, and sanctification in pastoral theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Perfectionism**
 - Warfield: claim that Christians can be made inwardly sinless in this life by a single act of grace.

- **Entire sanctification**
 - Wesleyan term critiqued as positing eradication rather than subjugation of sin.

- **Definitive sanctification**
 - Positional, legal standing in Christ; Warfield insists this does not equal eradication of corruption.

- **Progressive sanctification**
 - Ongoing moral growth; Warfield affirms this as the biblical norm.

- **Original sin (Nature and Origin of Sin)**
 - Warfield defends hereditary corruption - the root explanation for human depravity and the need for grace.

- **Total depravity / Total inability**
 - Affirms human inability to achieve saving righteousness apart from divine grace; used to rebut perfectionist claims.

- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism / Augustinianism**
 - Warfield locates perfectionism nearer Pelagianism/semi-Pelagianism and defends an Augustinian-Reformed corrective.

- **Indwelling sin / concupiscence**
 - Central psychological-theological category: an inward propensity to sin that persists after regeneration.

- **Sin and Free Will**
 - Warfield: free will is morally bound by sin; freedom restored only progressively by grace.

- **Justification vs Sanctification**
 - Clear juridical/positional distinction; justification is declarative, sanctification is transformative but not instantaneously exhaustive.

- **Eradication (vs Subjugation)**
 - Key contrast: perfectionism promises eradication; Warfield argues for subjugation and mortification as ongoing realities.

- **Moral impotence**
 - Term used to express inability without continual grace.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Reformed critiques of Wesleyan perfectionism (sanctification loci).
- As **polemic** in debates over Pelagian/Semi-Pelagian tendencies (nature/origin of sin and freedom).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline anthropology on indwelling sin and the struggle.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking total depravity/total inability with the doctrine of progressive sanctification.
