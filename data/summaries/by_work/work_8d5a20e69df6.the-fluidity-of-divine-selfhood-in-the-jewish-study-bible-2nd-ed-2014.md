### TITLE
**The Fluidity of Divine Selfhood** (Benjamin D. Sommer), in The Jewish Study Bible, 2nd ed. (2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Situated in contemporary Jewish biblical scholarship; appears in a Jewish Study Bible intended for both scholarly and informed lay readership.
 - Addresses late Second Temple and biblical-period textual phenomena from a philological and theological-historical perspective, dialoguing implicitly with Christian readings that find trinitarian seeds in the Hebrew Bible.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Hebrew Bible portrays a **non-rigid, internally variegated notion of divine identity** - a "fluid" selfhood in which YHWH's singularity coexists with plural expressions, distinct divine agents, and personified divine functions.
 - This raises questions for how one moves from biblical plurality to later systematic doctrines (e.g., the Trinity) without anachronism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of representative biblical phenomena that instantiate fluidity:
 - **Plural verbal forms and names** (Elohim; "Let us" in Genesis 1).
 - **Theophanic figures and intermediaries** (the Angel of the Lord; divine emissaries).
 - **Distinct divine agents or persons** (Wisdom, the divine Word, the Spirit) who act with divine authority.
 - **Divine council language** where YHWH presides among other heavenly beings while retaining ultimate sovereignty.
 - Interpretive move: these texts reflect a theological grammar permitting **multiplicity within divine action and speech** without presupposing later metaphysical formulations (e.g., Nicene personhood).
 - Caution against two errors:
 - Reading the OT as already espousing classical Trinitarian ontology.
 - Flattening the biblical data into a monolithic "strict" monotheism that erases internal diversity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the Hebrew Bible corpus and Second Temple interpretive traditions indirectly; converses with both Jewish interpretive tendencies and Christian theological readings that find trinitarian precedents in the OT.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, divine speech and agency, implicit antecedents to Trinitarian thinking, personhood language (Wisdom/Word), and Spirit Christology proximate issues across OT and NT readings.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the Bible presents a **complex, context-sensitive pattern of divine self-representation** that is theologically fertile and resists simple reduction to later creedal categories.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Frames biblical plurality as "fluidity of divine selfhood" rather than as mere linguistic irregularity or early error - a descriptive category that preserves textual ambiguity and theological nuance.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges readings that retroject Trinitarian metaphysics back into the Hebrew text; also corrects absolutist reconstructions of single-person divine identity that ignore intratextual plurality.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Moves away from polar labels like "monolatry" vs. "polytheism" toward a descriptive vocabulary that highlights **relational and functional plurality within unity**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Jewish biblical studies for its philological care and restraint; used in interfaith conversations as a clarifying corrective to simplistic OT-to-Trinity apologetics.
 - Has energized further study on how early Jewish and Christian communities negotiated divine multiplicity without collapsing into outright polytheism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, textually attentive corrective to anachronistic theological claims; useful for teaching on biblical theology, interreligious dialogue, and the historical groundwork for later Trinitarian formulations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine selfhood**
 - The way the biblical text characterizes the identity and agency of the divine subject (YHWH).
- **Fluidity**
 - The capacity of that selfhood to appear in varied, sometimes overlapping modes (plural speech, agents, personifications).
- **Elohim**
 - Plural-form name that functions grammatically and theologically to introduce questions about plurality and sovereignty.
- **"Let us" (Genesis 1)**
 - A central locus classicus for debates about plural speech; Sommer treats it as evidencing conceptual room for multiplicity without proving Trinitarian persons.
- **Angel of the Lord**
 - A theophanic intermediary who can speak and act as YHWH; illustrates functional identity-sharing within divine action.
- **Divine council**
 - Heavenly assembly motif where YHWH presides among other celestial beings - a setting that permits differentiated divine speech and decision.
- **Wisdom / Word (Memra)**
 - Personified aspects of divine activity that sometimes function quasi-personally and sometimes as modes of revelation.
- **Spirit as agent**
 - The Spirit appears as a distinct divine power/agent in prophetic and sapiential texts, corroborating internal plurality.
- **Personal plurality vs. ontological plurality**
 - Sommer distinguishes textual/persona plurality from later ontological claims about multiple eternal persons.
- **Second Temple pluralism**
 - Historical background that mediates earlier biblical fluidity toward more developed Christological and Trinitarian language in Christian sources.
- **Revelation**
 - How God chooses to manifest selfhood through plural speech and agents; central to assessing theological implications.
- **Trinity (receptional issue)**
 - Treated as a later theological response; Sommer uses biblical fluidity to caution against direct OT proof-texting for classical Trinitarian dogma.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for "biblical plurality" in OT theology courses.
 - As a **polemic tool** in interfaith dialogue to show limits of OT-to-Trinity apologetics.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading texts that depict multiple divine agents without imposing later metaphysical categories.
