### TITLE
Imago Dei and the Missio Dei - Richard Lints, in The Enduring Authority of the Christian Scriptures (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical context (2016). Part of a volume defending Scriptural authority; Lints writes as a systematic theologian addressing biblical foundations for doctrine and practice.
 - Engages both historic Reformed sources and contemporary missiological/theological debates about human identity and mission.

- **Central thesis**
 - The biblical doctrine of the **Imago Dei** (image of God) is the foundational theological category that grounds the **Missio Dei** (the mission of God) and therefore defines human vocation: to represent, steward, and participate in God's redemptive purposes in the world, fulfilled in Christ and enacted by the church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchoring in Genesis (1-2) and New Testament fulfilment (especially Pauline/Christological texts): the image is both constituted in creation and recapitulated in Christ.
 - Distinguishes and reconciles competing models of Imago Dei (substantive vs. functional) by locating the image in relational, covenantal, and vocational terms rather than in isolated capacities.
 - Argues the image is ontologically real yet damaged by sin; therefore mission includes restoration (not merely cultural advancement).
 - Locates human vocation in Trinitarian terms: the image is best understood through divine relationality and the sending (missio) of the Father through the Son in the Spirit.
 - Practical corollary: the church as the community that embodies the image and advances the Missio Dei in cultural, social, and evangelistic work.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical witness (Genesis, Psalms, Colossians, Hebrews, relevant Pauline texts).
 - Historic Reformed theologians (Calvin, Kuyper) and contemporary evangelical/missiological discussion; interaction with modern anthropologies that secularize or reduce the image.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (Imago Dei), Christology (Christ as fulfillment/true image), Trinity (relational grounding of image and mission), creation and new creation, sin and redemption, ecclesiology (church as missional agent), and normative authority of Scripture.

- **Closing line**
 - The Imago Dei, rightly read in Scripture and fulfilled in Christ, is the theological linchpin that makes sense of human dignity, vocation, and the church's participation in the Missio Dei.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats the image primarily as a **missional vocation** rather than only a metaphysical property: humans are image-bearers insofar as they represent and extend God's rule.
 - Strong Trinitarian framing: image-bearing is best explained by relationality and sending within the Godhead, not solely by isolated human capacities.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against purely **substantive** (e.g., rationality, moral capacity) or purely **functional** (role-based) reductions; proposes a synthetic account that preserves ontological status and vocation.
 - Challenges secular humanisms that locate human worth in autonomy, productivity, or self-definition rather than in covenantal, creaturely relation to God.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reframes Imago Dei as an **active and ecclesial reality** (embodied in the church's mission) rather than a static attribute.
 - Emphasizes **recapitulation in Christ** as the decisive axis: the full image is Christological and eschatological.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable within Reformed and evangelical circles for integrating doctrine and mission; used in pastoral and academic settings to justify robust mission theology grounded in anthropology.
 - Helps bridge biblical scholarship and systematic theology in discussions about human dignity and public theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a concise, Scripture-rooted framework that resists both secular reductionism and abstract metaphysics; useful for missiologists, ethicists, and pastors seeking to ground mission in doctrine.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - the biblical doctrine that humans are made in God's image; treated as constituting vocation, dignity, and representative authority.
- **Missio Dei** - God's sending; the theological concept of mission as emanating from God's own nature and purposes, into which humans are summoned.
- **Image-bearing** - active portrayal of God in word and deed; a vocation to steward creation and extend God's reign.
- **Substantive view** - locates the image in human capacities (reason, morality); Lints critiques its tendency to depersonalize vocation.
- **Functional view** - locates the image in human role/office (dominion/stewardship); Lints affirms the role but insists on ontological grounding.
- **Relational/Trinitarian image** - the image understood through the relational life of the Trinity; grounds human interpersonal vocation and community.
- **Christological fulfillment (Imago Christi)** - Christ as the true, undistorted image in whom the human vocation is restored and embodied.
- **Sin as distortion** - sin damages the image, creating the need for restorative mission rather than mere cultural enhancement.
- **Creation mandate / cultural mandate** - human call to cultivate and steward creation as part of image-bearing vocation; linked to mission.
- **Eschatological restoration** - the church's mission participates in the renewal of creation, anticipating full recapitulation in Christ.
- **Church as missional community** - the embodied agent that carries out the restoration and represents Christ as image-bearers.
- **Scriptural authority** - Scripture as normative for defining Imago Dei and Missio Dei; grounds theological anthropology and praxis.
- **Public theology implications** - the doctrine functions as a theological check on political and ethical claims about human worth.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a robust, Reformed account of Imago Dei tied to mission.
- As a **polemic** against secular and reductionist accounts of human dignity and vocation.
- As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating how Genesis and New Testament Christology cohere into a missional anthropology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching the integration of doctrine (anthropology, Christology, trinitarian theology) with missiology and ecclesial practice.
