### TITLE
Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church - Michael Lawrence

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed-evangelical setting. Written within the ongoing revival of redemptive-historical (Vosian) biblical theology and a corrective impulse to make that discipline ministerially useful to preaching, catechesis, and congregational formation.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Biblical theology must be practiced as an ecclesial discipline: its telos is the formation of a Christ-shaped congregation, not merely academic reconstruction of biblical history or an adjunct to systematic theology.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Defends a **Christ-centered, covenantal narrative** reading of Scripture (progressive revelation culminating in Christ).
 - Traces the history and methods of biblical theology, locating a preferable model in the Vosian/redemptive-historical tradition, but reorients that model toward pastoral application.
 - Articulates principles for sermon formation, catechesis, and sacramental practice that preserve both historical particularity and doctrinal generalization.
 - Demonstrates how typology, promise-fulfillment patterning, and canonical reading secure right preaching and worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Positively draws on **Geerhardus Vos** and the redemptive-historical lineage (also resonant with Graeme Goldsworthy).
 - Interacts critically with historians of biblical theology and with strands of canonical, form-critical, and narrative-critical scholarship that either flatten theological unity or exile theology from the pulpit.
 - Engages pastoral theology and homiletics literature to show practical outworkings.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (esp. covenant of grace), Christology (fulfillment motif), typology, soteriology, ecclesiology (church formation), sacraments (word and sacrament connection), hermeneutics (canonical and historical).
- **Closing line:** Lawrence centers biblical theology as a theologically disciplined service to the church: a covenantal, Christ-centered interpretive practice that shapes preaching, worship, and formation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Treats biblical theology primarily as an **ecclesial tool** - its success measured by church formation rather than scholarly reconstruction.
 - Stresses the inseparable link of **historical particularity and doctrinal application**: faithful exegesis of a text must yield both its redemptive-historical place and its congregation-forming application.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Corrects pietistic moralizing or purely topical preaching that strips texts of their covenantal context.
 - Contrasts with some academic biblical theology that privileges history-for-historys-sake or abstracts themes without pastoral translation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts "redemptive history" as a **ministerial hermeneutic** rather than a merely academic taxonomy - a small shift in emphasis but large in pastoral consequence.
 - Emphasizes a practiced **promise-fulfillment** vocabulary that ties typology and prophecy directly to corporate worship and sacrament.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Received positively in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a practical handbook for pastors seeking to apply redemptive-historical insights.
 - Influential among homileticians and catechetical instructors who want theology to be both historically responsible and ecclesially formative.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact model for integrating Vosian biblical theology with pulpit practice.
 - Valuable for pastors, seminary instructors, and advanced students wanting a bridge between scholarly method and congregational ministry.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology:** Discipline tracing redemptive-historical development within Scripture; here oriented to church use.
- **Redemptive-historical:** Emphasis on God's historical acts culminating in Christ; used as homiletical organizing principle.
- **Covenant (covenant of grace):** Primary relational framework for reading continuity and fulfillment across testaments.
- **Typology:** Old Testament persons, institutions, and events as divinely ordained foreshadowings fulfilled in Christ; employed for doctrinal and devotional preaching.
- **Promise-fulfillment:** Hermeneutical axis - promises given, fulfilled in Christ, applied to the church.
- **Christ-centered interpretation:** Every text read in light of Christ's person and work; not allegorizing but canonical fulfillment.
- **Canonical reading:** Attention to the final form of Scripture and its theological unity as normative for doctrine and preaching.
- **Ecclesial formation / congregational praxis:** The telos of biblical theology - shaping worship, catechesis, and spiritual formation.
- **Hermeneutic of application:** Method for moving from redemptive-historical understanding to congregational application without moralistic reduction.
- **Sacramental theology (word and sacrament connection):** Link between preached Word and visible means of grace; biblical theology grounds sacramental practice.
- **Historical particularity:** Fidelity to the original historical situation and meaning of texts as the basis for typological and doctrinal extension.
- **Pastoral homiletics:** The practical art of sermon formation using biblical-theological categories.
- **Progressive revelation:** Developmental view of divine disclosure across Scripture culminating in Christ.
- **Vosian lineage:** Referential shorthand for the redemptive-historical tradition Lawrence builds on.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for an ecclesial, Christ-centered construal of biblical theology.
- As a **polemic** against moralizing or abstracted biblical-theological approaches that neglect congregational formation.
- As an **exegetical-homiletical model** for sermon and catechetical construction grounded in covenantal typology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking biblical theology, homiletics, and pastoral theology.
