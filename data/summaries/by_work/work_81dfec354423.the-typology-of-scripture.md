### TITLE
**The Typology of Scripture** (Patrick Fairbairn, mid-19th c., Free Church of Scotland)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Scottish Free Church, post-Disruption evangelical Reformed milieu; rise of historical-grammatical exegesis; reaction to both spiritualizing allegory and rationalist criticism. First issued in the 1840s with later revisions; companion to Fairbairn's broader interest in biblical theology and prophecy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture reveals a divinely ordered, covenantal pedagogy in which Old Testament institutions, events, persons, and offices are **types** that prospectively prefigure and are fulfilled by **Christ and the new covenant**. Typology is objective, exegetically controlled, and grounded in the unity of the **covenant of grace**, not arbitrary allegory.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes **principles of typology**: divine institution, redemptive-historical placement, prospective intent signaled by Scripture, and organic correspondence between type and antitype.
 - Surveys **patriarchal and Mosaic types**: sacrifices, priesthood, tabernacle/temple, feasts, the exodus, wilderness, conquest, and the theocratic polity as a complex of shadows.
 - Develops **office-fulfillment**: prophet, priest, and king (munus triplex) as converging in Christ's person and work.
 - Explains the **Mosaic economy**: not a covenant of works in substance; it bears a legal, pedagogic overlay that exposes sin and tutors to Christ while administering the covenant of grace.
 - Treats the **land and theocracy** as typological of the kingdom of God, climaxing in the church's worldwide expansion and eschatological consummation.
 - Notes **prophetic-symbolic patterns**, including anti-typical opposition culminating in the man of lawlessness, to show unity of promise-fulfillment across Scripture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Engages Reformed federal tradition (Calvin, Witsius, Cocceius), older Protestant hermeneutics (Glassius, Vitringa), conservative German scholarship (e.g., Hengstenberg), and counters Roman Catholic allegory and rationalist denials of predictive unity.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and hermeneutics; covenant theology (works/grace; Mosaic administration); Christology (munus triplex, atonement, federal headship); ecclesiology (church as antitypical Israel); eschatology (pattern and consummation; antichrist/man of lawlessness).
- **Closing line:** The Bible's unity is covenantal and Christocentric; OT shadows, rightly read, are God's own pedagogy leading to the substance in Christ and his kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Objective typology**: insists on textual warrant and redemptive-historical placement rather than free allegory.
 - **Theocratic typology**: Israel's national polity is a divinely constructed **model-kingdom**, temporary and pedagogic, pointing to the universal reign of Christ.
 - **Law's pedagogy**: the Mosaic legal element functions as a temporary guardian within the covenant of grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Pushes back against **allegorism** that multiplies meanings apart from authorial and canonical intent.
 - Resists identifying the Mosaic covenant as **covenant of works in substance**; allows a formal or administrative **republication as to form**, not saving arrangement.
 - Distinguishes **symbol** from **type**, and both from **allegory** and mere illustration.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear rules for recognizing types (institution, intent, correspondence).
 - Refined account of the **typical theocracy** and the land as emblematic of eschatological rest.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became a standard Reformed handbook on typology; used in seminaries for preaching and hermeneutics.
 - Anticipates and informs later biblical-theological work (Vos) and strands taken up by modern federal and kingdom theology (including discussions of republication).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a disciplined **exegetical model** for Christ-centered reading without collapsing literal sense.
 - Clarifies **covenant theology** across OT-NT, aiding debates on Mosaic law and confessional formulations.
 - Equips preaching and teaching with warranted connections to Christ's **munus triplex** and the church's identity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Typology**: God-ordained, prospective correspondence between earlier redemptive realities and their fulfillment in Christ.
- **Type / Antitype**:
 - Type: divinely instituted, historically real prefigurement.
 - Antitype: later reality that fulfills and surpasses the type (chiefly Christ and his work).
- **Shadow and substance**: OT forms as shadows; Christ and the new covenant as substance (Col 2; Hebrews).
- **Covenant of Grace**: One saving covenant administered variously through the ages; the unity underlying OT-NT.
- **Covenant of Works**: Prelapsarian arrangement with Adam; not reinstated in substance under Moses.
- **Republication (as to form vs. substance)**:
 - Form: legal pedagogy and temporal sanctions mirror works principles.
 - Substance: denied; salvation remains by grace through promise.
- **Mosaic Economy / Theocracy**: Israel's national-church order as a designed exemplar of God's rule; temporary and typological.
- **Munus Triplex**: Christ as prophet, priest, and king, gathering in and surpassing all OT offices.
- **Federal Headship**: Adam and Christ as covenant heads; grounds typological and soteriological correspondences.
- **Promise-Fulfillment**: Canonical pattern linking patriarchal and Mosaic promises to Christ's advent and work.
- **Symbol vs. Type vs. Allegory**:
 - Symbol: signifying object within a system (e.g., altar).
 - Type: symbol with prospective, redemptive-historical intent.
 - Allegory: non-historical or free spiritualization; method to be constrained or avoided.
- **Prophetic Symbolism**: Visions and enacted signs that carry typological forward-pointers.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness**: Anti-typical opposition to Christ and his kingdom, climaxing eschatologically.
- **Confessional Formulations**: Westminster standards as guardrails for covenantal unity and law-gospel relations.
- **How this work is used:**
 - **Definition source** for typology and its rules in hermeneutics courses.
 - **Polemic touchstone** in debates on Mosaic covenant and republication.
 - **Exegetical model** for Christ-centered preaching of OT narratives, institutions, and offices.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology to Christology and eschatology (munus triplex; antichrist patterns).
