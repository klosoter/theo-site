### TITLE
**Resurrection and Redemption** (1978) - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. 
Princeton Theological Seminary / Reformed evangelical context; early-career monograph focusing on the theological centrality of the resurrection in Pauline doctrine and systematic theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-1970s Reformed evangelical reaction to liberal demythologizing and existential readings of the New Testament (e.g., Bultmann). Gaffin writes from a confessional Reformed perspective shaped by Vosian covenantal theology and historic Protestant orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis**
 - The bodily resurrection of Christ is the decisive, objective center of redemption: it is both the eschatological inauguration and the ontological basis for believers' justification, sanctification, and future bodily life in union with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation in Pauline passages (1 Cor 15; Rom 4-8; Colossians); demonstration that resurrection is historical and soteriologically constitutive.
 - The resurrection secures the believer's union with Christ: Christ's risen life becomes the believer's life (federal/organic union).
 - Critique of "spiritualizing" and existential approaches that downplay historicity; insistence on bodily, corporate, covenantal dimensions of redemption.
 - The resurrection functions as both *pattern* (Christ as firstfruits) and *ground* (eschatological consummation applied now) of salvation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages New Testament scholarship (critical forms of Bultmann), 20th-century theology that minimizes historicity, and patristic/Reformation sources (Augustine, Calvin, Vos). Dialogue with contemporaries on union with Christ and objective eschatology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (historical character), Christology (victory, exaltation), soteriology (union, justification, sanctification), eschatology (already/not-yet), anthropology (resurrection body), covenant theology (federal headship implications).
- **Site usage: five topical presences**
 - **Nature and Task of Theology:** model of theology rooted in biblical-historical exegesis; theology as doctrine built from historical redemptive acts.
 - **Traducianism vs Creationism:** addresses anthropological implications of solidarity and transmission of sin (focus on corporate/federal aspects more than settling the soul-origin debate).
 - **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism / Augustinianism:** polemic against Pelagian minimizing of need for Christ's grace; affirms Augustinian/Reformed dependence on grace realized in resurrection-union.
 - **Historicity & Federal Headship of Adam:** uses Pauline typology (Adam-Christ) to defend Adam's historical and representative role as crucial to understanding redemption by Christ.
 - **Epistemology & Knowledge of God:** argues resurrection as epistemic ground for Christian knowledge and hope - historical act that justifies theological claims and confers certainty.
- **Closing line**
 - Resurrection is not an appendage to soteriology but the ontological, historical-pneumatic nexus by which redemption is accomplished, applied, and known.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on the resurrection as both historically verifiable event and metaphysical ground for believers' new life - refusing either mythologizing or reductive existentialism.
 - Strong linking of resurrection to **union with Christ** in both federal and organic registers.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal/existential readings that spiritualize the resurrection; contrasts romanticized "spiritual life" accounts with concrete, bodily eschatology.
 - Reorients pneumatology: Spirit's efficacy is understood primarily in relation to the risen Christ rather than as an independent experiential datum.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and emphasizes the language of *firstfruits* and *constitutive union* to move beyond dualistic soul/body categories toward covenantal corporateness.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in conservative Reformed seminaries as a corrective to demythologizing trends; influenced later work on Pauline theology and resurrection apologetics; frequently cited by those defending objective eschatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, exegetically anchored template for integrating biblical theology, systematic claims, and pastoral implications regarding hope, sanctification, and eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Resurrection (bodily)** - historical, bodily rising of Christ as the decisive redemptive event.
- **Union with Christ** - the ontological bond by which Christ's risen life becomes the believer's life (federal and organic dimensions).
- **Firstfruits** - Christ's resurrection as the inaugural event guaranteeing corporate eschatological participation.
- **Objective eschatology** - emphasis on real, historical consummatory acts rather than merely subjective experience.
- **Redemptive history (Heilsgeschichte)** - theology constructed from historical acts (death, resurrection, ascension) rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **Federal headship** - Adam/Christ typology; Adam's historical representation and Christ's representative reversal.
 - Relation to historicity: supports reading Adam as historical figure with corporate consequences.
- **Pneumatology (Spirit and Resurrection)** - Spirit as operative in applying the resurrection's life to believers; Spirit's work is anchored in Christ's bodily vindication.
- **Anti-demythologizing stance** - rejects existential relegation of resurrection to mere meaning; affirms empirical-historical claim.
- **Soteriological ground** - resurrection as the ontological basis for justification, sanctification, and future bodily life.
- **Theological epistemology** - the resurrection functions as knowledge-basis for Christian claims about God and eschatological hope.
- **Original sin (corporate solidarity)** - stress on corporate transmission and federal consequences rather than neat settlement of traducian/creationist soul-origins.
- **Pelagianism critique** - rejection of human-initiated righteousness; necessity of resurrection-applied grace.
- **Covenantal continuity** - redemption interpreted within covenant-historical framework rather than isolated individualistic soteriology.
- **Exegetical model** - close Pauline exegesis as exemplar for doctrinal construction.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for resurrection-centered soteriology and union with Christ.
- As a **polemic** against demythologizing and Pelagian tendencies.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline texts (1 Cor 15; Rom) in systematic theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking anthropology, federal headship, and epistemology to the single event of Christ's resurrection.
