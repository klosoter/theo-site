### TITLE
Responsibility And Control: A Theory Of Moral Responsibility - John Martin Fischer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Analytic philosophy of action and ethics, 1990s; reaction to Frankfurt cases and the revival of debates over alternate possibilities.
 - Part of a broader turn toward precise compatibilist accounts that separate freedom-to-do-otherwise from moral responsibility.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Moral responsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise**; rather it requires a form of control Fischer calls **guidance control**, which can obtain even under determinism.
 - This position is commonly labeled **semicompatibilism**: moral responsibility is compatible with determinism even if free will (in some senses) is not.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reject PAP (the Principle of Alternate Possibilities) via engagement with **Frankfurt-style counterexamples** showing attribution of responsibility even when alternatives are absent.
 - Introduce a twofold taxonomy of control:
 - **Regulative control**: the capacity to do otherwise (classical freedom).
 - **Guidance control**: control manifested in the actual sequence of events by which an agent brings about an action.
 - Define conditions for guidance control:
 - **Sourcehood**: the action issues from the agent in the right way (owning the process).
 - **Moderate reasons-responsiveness**: the mechanism or processes producing action are responsive to reasons in a regular, appropriately robust way.
 - Argue that guidance control suffices for moral responsibility; explore variations (local/global reasons-responsiveness) and address manipulation and Frankfurt-style objections.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Key interlocutors: Harry Frankfurt (Frankfurt cases), P. F. Strawson (reactive attitudes), Robert Kane (libertarianism), Gary Watson.
 - Engages debates in analytic metaphysics of agency, moral psychology, and jurisprudence.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Not explicitly theological doctrines, but treats central concepts relevant to theology: moral culpability, agency, desert, and responsibility under determinism (implications for divine foreknowledge and providence).
- **Closing line**
 - Fischer reframes moral responsibility away from alternate possibilities toward an agent-centered **guidance-control** account that preserves responsibility in a deterministic framework.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp separation of **regulative** vs **guidance** control; moral responsibility anchored in the latter.
 - Emphasis on **mechanisms** and their reasons-responsiveness rather than metaphysical indeterminacy.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges libertarian readings that insist on alternate possibilities (Kane) and revises Strawsonian appeals by specifying the cognitive/functional basis of reactive attitudes.
 - Moves beyond simple compatibilist talk by providing a technical account of what control must be.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - **Semicompatibilism** as a programmatic label.
 - Articulation of **moderate reasons-responsiveness** and the use of "mechanism" to describe the agentive processes relevant to responsibility.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in contemporary analytic debates on free will and responsibility; spawned empirical and normative refinements.
 - Provoked responses from libertarians, hard incompatibilists, and those emphasizing the phenomenology of choice.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable, teachable framework for attributing moral responsibility without reliance on controversial metaphysical freedom.
 - Useful bridge between theoretical debates and practical questions in ethics, law, and theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Semicompatibilism**
 - Claim that moral responsibility is compatible with determinism, even if some forms of free will are not.
- **Principle of Alternate Possibilities (PAP)**
 - Traditional thesis that responsibility requires genuine alternatives; Fischer rejects its necessity.
- **Frankfurt cases**
 - Thought experiments showing responsibility can be ascribed without alternate possibilities; pivotal to Fischer's move.
- **Regulative control**
 - Control as the power to do otherwise; linked to classical freedom/libertarian concerns.
- **Guidance control**
 - Fischer's central notion: control evidenced in the actual processes issuing actions, sufficient for responsibility.
- **Sourcehood**
 - The requirement that actions genuinely originate from the agent (not merely manipulated).
- **Reasons-responsiveness**
 - The mechanism-level capacity to react to reasons; can be local or global, strong or moderate.
 - **Moderate reasons-responsiveness**: Fischer's threshold for responsibility, not requiring perfect sensitivity.
- **Mechanism**
 - The psychological/causal processes that produce actions; judged for reasons-responsiveness and ownership.
- **Manipulation problem**
 - Challenge: if an agent is manipulated but responsive, are they responsible? Fischer addresses this via sourcehood and history.
- **Reactive attitudes**
 - Strawson-inspired notion of interpersonal practices that track responsibility; Fischer integrates these with mechanistic criteria.
- **Sourcehood vs history**
 - Distinguishes present ownership of processes from problematic historical manipulation; both relevant to final verdicts.
- **Moral responsibility**
 - For Fischer, a function of guidance control, not of metaphysical openness to alternatives.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for responsibility in systematic ethics and philosophical theology, supporting attributions under divine foreknowledge or providential determinism.
- As a **polemic tool** against libertarian accounts that insist on alternate possibilities, and a counterpoint in debates with incompatibilists.
- As an **exegetical model** for theological discussions of culpability, sin, and pastoral responsibility where causal determinism is assumed or asserted.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in law and moral psychology for assessing agency, blameworthiness, and mitigating factors.
