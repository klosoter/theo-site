### TITLE
Salvation by Grace: The Case for Effectual Calling and Regeneration - Matthew Barrett

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed evangelical milieu; part of renewed attention (21st century) to classical Protestant soteriology in response to Arminian, Wesleyan, and popular "decision theology" trends. Aimed at both academic and pastoral audiences seeking biblical and historical defense of monergistic regeneration.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Barrett argues that **regeneration and effectual calling are divine, monergistic acts that precede and enable saving faith**. He defends a robust doctrine of effectual calling against synergistic models that make human will decisive in initial salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of pivotal texts (e.g., John 1-6, Romans 9, Ephesians 2, Titus 3) to show biblical priority of divine initiative.
 - Historical-theological survey: tracing patristic, medieval, and Reformation treatments (Augustine, Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy) to show continuity and to correct later deviations.
 - Philosophical and theological analysis: critique of libertarian free-will assumptions and defense of a compatibilist anthropology that coheres with total depravity.
 - Pastoral and practical implications: how doctrine shapes evangelism, assurance, worship, and discipleship.
 - Polemic: responses to Arminian and semi-Pelagian positions that assert prevenient grace or conditional election as decisive.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with Scripture; historical interlocutors include Augustine, Calvin, Edwards, and Reformed confessions; contemporary interlocutors implied include Arminian and Wesleyan theologians, plus modern defenders of conditional regeneration.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (effectual calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, perseverance), anthropology (total depravity), divine sovereignty and providence, grace, election, and ecclesial/pastoral theology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Salvation is fundamentally the work of God: effectual calling and regeneration are sovereign, efficacious acts by which God makes sinners spiritually alive so that faith and repentance follow as gifts rather than achievements.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear distinction between **general call** (proclamation) and **effectual call** (God's efficacious internal summons); Barrett stresses precision of terms to avoid conflation.
 - Moves beyond stock affirmations of "irresistible grace" toward a biblically nuanced account of how God effects willing hearts without moral coercion.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges theology that locates the decisive moment of salvation in a human "response" that is antecedent to divine regeneration.
 - Counters models that posit a neutral or cooperative human will capable of producing saving faith apart from a sovereign change wrought by God.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Emphasis on **regeneration as ontological re-creation** rather than merely a change of disposition; regeneration described as the necessary grounding for subsequent faith and sanctification.
 - Careful language to avoid caricatures: reframes "irresistible" in pastoral and biblical rather than mechanistic terms.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Well-received in Reformed academic and pastoral circles as a clear, readable defense of classic soteriology.
 - Used by pastors and seminary instructors as a corrective against popular decision-focused evangelism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a compact synthesis of biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral concern; valuable as a teaching primer and a polemical resource within confessional Reformed settings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Effectual calling:** The inward, efficacious work of God by which He summons and secures sinners to salvation; distinct from the outward proclamation of the gospel.
- **Regeneration:** The sovereign, monergistic act of God that makes spiritually dead sinners alive; ontological re-creation enabling faith.
- **Monergism:** The view that God alone is the agent in regeneration; human will does not cooperate in the initial impartation of new life.
- **Synergism:** Contrasted view that human will cooperates with divine grace in salvation; Barrett critiques this as inconsistent with Scripture and lamentable theologically.
- **Total depravity:** The doctrine that sin has affected every dimension of human nature, rendering unaided human will incapable of saving faith.
- **Ordo salutis (order of salvation):** Barrett affirms a sequence where regeneration/effectual calling precedes faith; used to clarify theological and pastoral order.
- **General call vs effectual call:** 
 - General call = outward proclamation, offer of the gospel to all.
 - Effectual call = particular, efficacious work of God that results in new birth.
- **Faith as instrument:** Faith is presented as the means (gift) by which regenerated sinners receive justification; it is consequent on regeneration.
- **Irresistible grace (reframed):** Treated not as mechanical compulsion but as God's sovereign, efficacious persuasion that overcomes deadness.
- **Prevenient grace (critical note):** Barrett critiques the Arminian use of prevenient grace as insufficient to secure saving response without regeneration.
- **Assurance and pastoral application:** Regeneration grounds assurance; doctrine shapes evangelistic methods away from reliance on human decision alone.
- **Evangelistic practice:** Emphasizes proclamation with confidence in God's sovereign calling, paired with pastoral humility and urgent appeal.
- **Biblical exegesis model:** Uses key Johannine, Pauline, and Pauline-epistolary texts as hermeneutical loci for the doctrine.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** and pedagogical primer for effectual calling and regeneration.
 - As a **polemic** resource against Arminian/conditional-regeneration frameworks.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading John and Paul on divine initiative in salvation and for framing pastoral practice and assurance.
