### TITLE
Baptism and Fullness: The Work of the Holy Spirit Today - John Stott

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-1970s evangelical/Anglican milieu (published 1975). Written amid the global Charismatic renewal and rising Pentecostal influence within historic Protestant denominations.
 - Stott speaks as a leading evangelical public theologian seeking a balanced pastoral and biblical response to charismatic claims.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Stott aims to clarify what the New Testament means by the "baptism of the Holy Spirit" and the "filling" of the Spirit, correcting both naïve uncritical acceptance of charismatic excesses and reductive cessationist dismissals.
 - He poses: how are baptism, fullness, gifts, and Spirit-empowerment related to conversion, Christian life, and mission?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: close readings of Acts, Luke, John and Pauline texts to map usages of Spirit-baptism and fillings.
 - Distinction: argues for a primary, once-for-all Spirit-baptism that unites believers to Christ (normative to conversion/union), and recurring "fillings" that empower Christian service and sanctification.
 - Critique of evidence-claims: challenges the thesis that speaking in tongues is the necessary or universal sign of Spirit-baptism.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial implications: calls for order, scriptural control, witnessed fruit (holiness and mission), and pastoral discernment in assessing charismatic manifestations.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Pentecostal and Charismatic proponents (popular leaders and movements of the 60s-70s) and older evangelical/Anglican sacramental and pietist perspectives.
 - Biblical exegesis interacts with Acts tradition, Pauline pneumatology, Johannine motifs; conversant with contemporary evangelical scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (primary focus): baptism and filling of the Spirit, gifts (charismata), fruit of Spirit.
 - Soteriology and union with Christ (Spirit as the bond of incorporation).
 - Ecclesiology and mission (Spirit-empowerment for witness and service).
 - Sacramentology overlap (relation of Spirit-baptism to water baptism).
 - Authority of Scripture as normative for assessing experience.

- **Closing line**
 - Stott proposes a mediating evangelical pneumatology: the Spirit unites believers once with Christ (baptism), repeatedly empowers them for holiness and mission (fillings), and must be judged by Scripture, fruit, and order rather than by single evidential tests.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, practical distinction between *baptism* (once-for-all incorporation) and *filling* (recurrent empowerment) without collapsing one into the other.
 - Emphasis on fruits (holiness, love, mission) as normative evidence of authentic Spirit-work, not exclusively ecstatic signs.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushback against Pentecostal/charismatic claims that tongues are the necessary evidence of Spirit-baptism or that Spirit-baptism is always a distinct post-conversion second blessing.
 - Also corrective to rigid cessationists: he allows for the ongoing operation of charismatic gifts but insists on biblical restraint and pastoral prudence.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Advocates terminological precision (baptism vs filling vs gifts) as theological and pastoral tools rather than mere semantics.
 - Recasts Spirit-baptism as primarily ontological (identity in Christ) and fillings as functional (empowerment for service).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among evangelicals seeking a middle way; became a standard reference for moderate evangelical responses to the Charismatic movement.
 - Influenced Anglican and broader Protestant conversations, often cited by those advocating cautious openness to gifts.
 - Criticized by Pentecostal purists (for restraint) and hard-line cessationists (for openness).

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a pastoral, exegetically grounded approach to contested spiritual phenomena.
 - Remains a go-to resource for teaching balanced pneumatology in pastoral formation and denominational discernment.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Stott: primarily a one-time, uniting act that incorporates the believer into Christ and the church.

- **Filling of the Spirit**
 - Recurring empowerments for service, witness, and sanctification distinct from initial baptism.

- **Speaking in tongues**
 - Treated as a charismatic gift; not a universal or necessary sign of Spirit-baptism per Stott.

- **Charismatic renewal**
 - The 20th-century movement prompting Stott's study; he seeks measured engagement rather than wholesale embrace or rejection.

- **Continuationism vs Cessationism**
 - Stott adopts a qualified continuationist posture: gifts may continue but must be biblically regulated.

- **Evidence (of Spirit-work)**
 - For Stott: primary evidence = transformed life, holiness, and mission; secondary = charismatic manifestations subject to testing.

- **Union with Christ**
 - Spirit-baptism as the means of ontological union and identity in the body of Christ.

- **Gifts (charismata)**
 - Functional gifts distributed by the Spirit for building the church; their exercise must serve order and edification.

- **Scriptural normativity**
 - Scripture is the controlling criterion for discerning and regulating Spirit-led experiences.

- **Second blessing / post-conversion experience**
 - Stott rejects a uniform "second blessing" model while recognizing that some believers do experience distinct subsequent fillings.

- **Sacramental relation**
 - Explores relation between water baptism and Spirit-baptism: related but not identical; water baptism symbolizes incorporation effected by the Spirit.

- **Mission and witness**
 - Spirit-empowerment is ultimately for evangelistic and ecclesial commission, not for private exaltation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical pneumatology that distinguishes baptism and filling succinctly.
- As a **polemic** resource against excessive evidentialism (tongues-as-proof) and against simplistic cessationism.
- As an **exegetical model**: close, balanced reading of Acts and Paul applied to contemporary practice.
- As a **pastoral-conceptual pivot** for denominations seeking ordered openness to charismatic gifts while upholding Scripture and ecclesial oversight.
