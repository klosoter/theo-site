### TITLE
Aquinas on Human Nature (ed. Richard Pasnau) - Thomas Aquinas: hylomorphic anthropology, ensoulment, and the origin of the soul (creationism vs traducianism).

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 13th-century Scholasticism; Thomas Aquinas synthesizing Aristotelian metaphysics with Latin Christian theology; later collected and edited by Pasnau for contemporary readers.
 - Intellectual milieu: recovery of Aristotle (via Islamic and Jewish commentators), Augustinian theological commitments, pastoral concerns about original sin and baptism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Human beings are a hylomorphic composite: body (matter) + rational soul (substantial form). The rational soul is immaterial, individuating, and directly created by God rather than propagated through parental generation (creationism vs traducianism).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Metaphysical groundwork: act and potency, substantial form as the principle of unity and life.
 - Definition of soul: soul as the form of the body with distinct powers (vegetative, sensitive, rational).
 - Faculties analysis: intellect (possible and agent), will, passions - moral psychology and moral responsibility depend on these faculties.
 - Origin of the soul: critique of traducianism; defense of immediate divine creation (while engaging Aristotelian biology on animation).
 - Theological implications: transmission of original sin, immortality of the soul, grace and final end (beatific vision).
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Primary philosophical: Aristotle (De Anima, Metaphysics), Avicenna, Averroes.
 - Theological: Augustine, Peter Lombard, earlier medieval scholastics; contemporaries like Albertus Magnus.
 - Opposing positions: various medieval proponents of traducianist tendencies and naturalistic accounts of generation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology (imago Dei), soul/body relation, ensoulment, original sin and its transmission, immortality, intellect and will, grace and beatific end.
- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas locates human dignity and culpability in the rational soul as a created, subsistent form: a metaphysical account that secures both personal immortality and theological claims about sin, grace, and salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous hylomorphism: the soul is not an additive occupant but the form making a human one unified substance.
 - Metaphysical defense of individual, immaterial intellect against materialist or semi-materialist readings.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects traducianism primarily on metaphysical grounds: souls, as subsistent forms, cannot be diffused or propagated like corporeal matter.
 - Modifies Aristotelian biology where necessary to preserve doctrinal claims (e.g., soul immateriality, immortality).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise mapping of faculties (possible intellect, agent intellect, will) into a theological anthropology where divine causality secures origin and final beatitude.
 - Use of act/potency to explain generation without making the soul a product of matter.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Central for Catholic theology and later Thomistic revivals; shaped magisterial teaching on the soul, ensoulment, and personhood.
 - Engaged critically by Protestant and modern thinkers; the creationism vs traducianism debate continued in Reformation and modern bioethical contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent metaphysical account linking ontology, moral responsibility, and soteriology - indispensable for teaching historical and systematic anthropology, and for modern debates about personhood and prenatal ethics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism** - human being as matter + substantial form; the form is the soul.
- **Substantial form** - the principle that actualizes matter into a specific kind (the rational soul for humans).
- **Act and potency** - metaphysical engine explaining generation, change, and why the soul is not merely inherited as matter is.
- **Creationism (of the soul)** - each human soul is immediately created by God; Aquinas's favored position against traducianism.
- **Traducianism** - the view that the soul is propagated by parents along with the body; Aquinas critiques this on metaphysical and theological grounds.
- **Ensoulment / animation** - the moment a body becomes ensouled; Aquinas treats this in light of biology and divine causation (allows discussion of stages while insisting on divine creation).
- **Possible intellect / agent intellect** - Aquinas's bifurcation of cognitive powers used to account for abstraction and intellectual knowledge.
- **Imago Dei (image of God)** - linked to rationality, will, and relational capacities; grounds human dignity and moral responsibility.
- **Original sin transmission** - problem: how is sin transmitted if the soul is created by God? Aquinas answers via the composite human nature and the causal order of generation.
- **Immortality of the soul** - consequence of the soul's immaterial subsistence and its capacity for intellectual knowing and union with God.
- **Subsistent form** - term for the soul as a form capable of existing upon God's immediate causation.
- **Moral psychology (will and passions)** - delineates how freedom, habit, and grace operate in human acting.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: definitive medieval account of human nature for systematic anthropology.
 - Polemic tool: primary Thomistic ammunition against traducianist and materialist accounts of personhood.
 - Exegetical / pastoral model: informs sacramental and moral reasoning about baptism, ensoulment, and prenatal ethics.
