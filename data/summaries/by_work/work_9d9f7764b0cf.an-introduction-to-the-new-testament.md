### TITLE
**An Introduction to the New Testament** 
D. A. Carson and Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published within late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical scholarship; designed as a seminary/academic textbook bridging rigorous historical-critical method and confessional evangelical commitments.
 - Reflects reaction to both liberal skepticism and naive fundamentalism; situated in anglophone evangelical academe with strong engagement of continental and British critical scholarship.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament is a historically rooted collection of documents that must be read with sound historical-critical tools while remaining theologically coherent for Christian faith and ministry.
 - Implicit doctrinal aim: to enable informed theological use of the NT without surrendering historical plausibility.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Systematic, book-by-book introduction: authorship, date, provenance, purpose, structure, key themes, theological contribution, and interpretive problems.
 - Major moves:
 - Present the historical and textual evidence for each NT writing.
 - Weigh critical hypotheses (e.g., authorship/dating, redactional layers) with evidential standards.
 - Offer theological summation and pastoral implications.
 - Includes chapters on canon formation, textual criticism, and early reception.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broad critical literature: form, redaction, and social-scientific critics; major scholars such as Bauckham, Dunn, Sanders, E. P. Sanders, N. T. Wright (as interlocutors of the era), and traditional commentators.
 - Interacts with patristic evidence and manuscript tradition when treating text-critical and canonical questions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (canon and inspiration implications).
 - Christology (NT portraits of Jesus; high/low christological strands).
 - Atonement and soteriology (Pauline theology, Johannine motifs).
 - Eschatology (synoptic, Pauline, and Johannine emphases).
 - Ecclesiology and ethics (pastoral letters, Hebrews, James).
 - Implicit treatment of covenant theology where relevant to Pauline and Johannine texts.

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - A cautious, evangelical refusal to separate rigorous historical-critical exegesis from normative theological reading: the NT is both an ancient historical corpus and authoritative witness to Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balanced conservatism: neither uncritical traditionalism nor unbridled skepticism; decisions are evidence-weighted and transparently argued.
 - Strong concern for the theological import of historical conclusions rather than mere antiquarian detail.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects fundamentalist dismissal of critical methods while pushing back on maximal critical skepticism that privileges theory over textual/data.
 - Contrasts with purely literary or exclusively social-scientific introductions by retaining theological assessment as integral.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Notionally champions a calibrated epistemic humility: methodological pluralism (textual, historical, redactional, social-scientific) applied with clear criteria for judging competing reconstructions.
 - Emphasizes "exegesis-for-theology" as distinct from purely historical reconstruction.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely adopted as a standard evangelical seminary textbook; praised for clarity, scope, and bibliographic help.
 - Influential in shaping a generation of pastors and scholars who attempt integration of historical-critical scholarship with confessional theology.
 - Criticized by radical critics for perceived conservatism and by some traditionalists for conceding too much to critical methods.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Durable pedagogical model: comprehensive, readable, and careful about evidential claims; excellent orientation for further specialized study.
 - Strong bibliographies and balanced judgments make it a reliable first reference for NT book studies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Authorship** - assessment of internal and external evidence for who wrote each NT book.

- **Redaction criticism** - analysis of how authors edited sources to convey theological aims.
- **Synoptic Problem** - discussion of source theories (Markan priority, Q, etc.) and their implications for Jesus tradition.
- **Pauline corpus** - criteria for authentic Pauline letters, theological profile, and pastoral letters debates.
- **Christology** - NT portraits of Jesus, high/low Christological strands, and development across corpus.
- **Canon formation** - historical steps to NT canon and implications for authority.
- **Historical-critical method** - methodology balancing skepticism and credulity; explicit evidential standards.
- **Social-scientific criticism** - occasional use to elucidate first-century social contexts and group dynamics.
- **Theological interpretation** - integration of historical exegesis with confessional reading for doctrine and ministry.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definition source and standard textbook for NT introductions in evangelical seminaries.
 - As an exegetical model that integrates critical methods with theological commitments, useful for homiletics, systematic theology, and pastoral training.
 - As a measured polemic against both extreme skepticism and anti-critical literalism; a conceptual pivot for conservative-critical engagement.
