### TITLE
Sermons (Sermones) - Anonymous Latin Homiletic Corpus (medieval tradition)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Anonymous collection of Latin sermons typical of medieval Western Christendom (circa broadly 8th-13th c. in surviving manuscripts). Origin: monastic and cathedral preaching milieu; used in pastoral catechesis and schoolroom exegesis rather than formal conciliar legislation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To proclaim and domesticate orthodox Christology and eschatology for congregations: affirm the unity of the Person of Christ while explaining the reality of his two natures, and to warn the faithful about apocalyptic error (Antichrist/Man of Lawlessness) in ways that sustain devotional worship and sacramental practice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Opening exposition of a Scriptural text (often Gospel pericopes) → doctrinal gloss (Christological formulae) → moral application and pastoral exhortation.
 - Recurrent moves: invoke Fathers (Augustine, Gregory, Jerome) to establish orthodoxy; rehearse Chalcedonian language indirectly; apply communicatio idiomatum to preaching and Eucharistic devotion; contrast true Christ with heretical conceptions and apocalyptic impostors.
 - Final pastoral summons addressing local life, piety, and vigilance against false teachers.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (Gospels, Pauline letters), patristic authorities (especially Augustine and Gregory), liturgical and sacramental practice; interlocutors implicitly include Nestorian, Monophysite/Eutychian positions and popular apocalyptic expectation about Antichrist.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (Incarnation, Hypostatic Union), the Chalcedonian two-natures teaching, communicatio idiomatum (attribution of properties), soteriology (atonement), impassibility/passibility, ecclesiology (preaching, sacraments), and eschatology (Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness).
- **Closing line:** The anonymous Sermones aim to make Chalcedonian Christology materially operative in parish life: a single Person who is fully God and fully man is preached, suffered with, received at the table, and awaited against every false Christ and last-day deception.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Homiletic condensation of technical Christological language into vivid pastoral imagery (e.g., God who stoops, God who hangs on the cross).
 - Strong stress on the practical consequences of the communicatio idiomatum for Eucharistic devotion and penitential life.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Functions as a corrective to both Nestorian separation of natures and Monophysite absorption of human nature by restating a unified Person without confusing or dividing natures.
 - Counters popular apocalyptic sensationalism by anchoring eschatological warnings in Christological and ecclesial identity rather than in mere prediction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularization of "communicatio" language in the pulpit: attributing Christ's sufferings, emotions, and properties to the single Person for pastoral ends, sometimes blurring strict scholastic distinctions but retaining orthodox bounds.
 - Use of example-driven typology (e.g., Adam/Christ, Moses/Christ) to teach hypostatic realities.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in medieval preaching praxis and as source material in cathedral schools; later scholastics and Reformation-era preachers drew on homiletic formulations to teach Christology to laity.
 - Valued in later theology for illustrating how high theological claims were transmitted pastorally.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models how doctrinal formulations (Chalcedon; communicatio idiomatum) function in lived piety.
 - Useful for studying reception history of Christological doctrine and the intersection of eschatology with pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** The union of divine and human natures in the one Person of Christ; sermons present this as the ground for trustworthy salvation and sacramental perception.
- **Chalcedonian Definition / Two Natures Doctrine:** Expressed homiletically as "one person, two natures without confusion or division"; used to repel both division and absorptionist errors.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** Practical claim that properties of both natures may be ascribed to the one Person (e.g., "God suffered" in the sense that the Person suffered in his human nature); the sermons use this to defend Eucharistic language and devotional attribution.
- **Person (Hypostasis):** Emphasized to secure that the subject who acts, suffers, and redeems is numerically one.
- **Nature (Natura):** Distinctions between divine and human attributes are preserved in preaching while stressing their personal unity.
- **Passibility / Impassibility:** Sermons negotiate Christ's suffering (passibility) and divine impassibility, often privileging pastoral empathy: God truly felt human suffering in the incarnate Person.
- **Antichrist / Man of Lawlessness:** Treated as real eschatological danger; sermons combine scriptural signs with pastoral exhortation to discern and resist deceptive claimants.
- **Eschatological vigilance:** A recurrent homiletic theme linking right Christological confession with readiness against false Christs.
- **Atonement / Expiation:** Christ's suffering and death are presented as both real human suffering and effective divine atonement because of hypostatic union.
- **Patristic witness:** Fathers are cited to authorize homiletic Christological claims and to mediate technical language to congregations.
- **Nestorianism / Eutychianism (as negative categories):** Used polemically to illustrate heretical errors the sermons correct.
- **Sacramental language:** Eucharistic formulas in the sermons rely on communicatio idiomatum to speak of receiving Christ truly.
- **Typology:** Uses Old Testament types to make hypostatic and eschatological claims accessible.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **popular-definition source**: to show how Chalcedonian categories were taught to laity.
 - As **polemic material**: to rebut heretical tendencies (Nestorian/Monophysite) and to counter apocalyptic misinformation.
 - As an **exegetical-homiletic model**: for bridging technical Christology and parish preaching, demonstrating pastoral application of communicatio idiomatum.
