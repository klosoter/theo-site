### TITLE
On Being and Essence (De Ente et Essentia) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Composed c. 1260s as a didactic scholastic treatise in the thirteenth-century Dominican milieu; presupposes Aristotle, Augustine, and Arab commentators (especially Avicenna and Averroes).
 - Part of Aquinas's broader metaphysical project that culminates in the Summa Theologiae and the Summa Contra Gentiles; aimed at clarifying foundational notions for theology and natural philosophy.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To analyze the distinction and relation between **essence (quidditas, essentia)** and **existence (esse)** in created beings and to show the special metaphysical status of God in which **essence and existence are identical** (God is ipsum esse subsistens).
 - Provides the metaphysical grounding for the possibility and limits of natural knowledge of God.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Begins with an exposition of being (ens) as the most universal concept, then defines and distinguishes essence and existence.
 - Major moves:
 - Show that in finite, created beings **essence** (what a thing is) is metaphysically distinct from **existence** (that a thing is) - a real composition of *potency and act*.
 - Demonstrate that in God there is no such composition: God's essence is existence itself (no potency), hence divine simplicity.
 - Derive consequences: modality of predication, analogical language about God, and the epistemic route to God via effects (creaturely participation in being permits inferential knowledge of the divine cause).
 - Emphasizes the "actus essendi" (act of being) as the key to understanding causality and dependency.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Aristotle (Metaphysics, Categories), Augustine (for theological motifs), Avicenna (Ibn Sina) and Averroes (Ibn Rushd) as principal Islamic interlocutors.
 - Engages with medieval nominalists and Averroists on universals and the intelligibility of essences.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Primary: metaphysics of being, essence/existence distinction, divine simplicity, causality and participation.
 - Secondary implications: natural theology (existence and knowability of God), attributes of God (aseity, immutability), and the theory of predication (analogy).

- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas's compact metaphysical core: creatures = essence + act of existence; God = identical essence and existence (ipsum esse subsistens), a move that secures both theistic simplicity and a principled path from creaturely being to knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Introduces and canonicalizes the phrase **actus essendi** (act of being) as the ontological principle distinguishing finite beings from God.
 - Sharp insistence on **metaphysical composition** (not merely conceptual) of essence and existence in creatures.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects Avicenna's treatment by incorporating Christian theological commitments: God is not merely a highest species but the very act of being.
 - Distinguishes himself from nominalists by defending the intelligibility of essences and the mind's capacity to form universal concepts without collapsing them into independent subsistent universals.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Consolidates the technical apparatus of essence/esse, ipsum esse subsistens, and analogy of being in a compact form that became standard scholastic vocabulary.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Central in Catholic scholasticism and later Thomistic revival; formative for medieval and early modern metaphysics.
 - Influenced natural theology debates: used by later defenders of classical theism; contested by modern philosophers who favor univocity of being (e.g., Scotists) or reject metaphysical realism.
 - Reformed theology: selectively appropriated (e.g., use of natural theology), but often reinterpreted in light of covenantal and revelational emphases.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise metaphysical framework that undergirds classical theism, supplies tools for natural theology, and clarifies limits of divine knowability and predication - essential for systematic, philosophical, and apologetic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ens (being)** - the most universal notion; starting-point for metaphysics.
- **Essentia (essence, quidditas)** - what a thing is; the definition or quiddity.
- **Esse (existence, actus essendi)** - that a thing is; the metaphysical act that actualizes essence.
- **Composition of essence and existence** - in creatures, a real metaphysical composition (essence distinct from act of being).
- **Ipsum esse subsistens** - God as self-subsistent act of being; essence = existence.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - predication of being is neither univocal nor equivocal; applied analogically to God and creatures.
- **Potency and act** - metaphysical distinction underlying composition; creatures have potency to receive existence.
- **Quidditas** - the 'whatness' abstracted by the intellect; intelligible but not identical to existence.
- **Predication / attribution** - explains how terms (e.g., 'good', 'wise') can be truly said of creatures and God without equivocation.
- **Participation** - creatures participate in being; their existence is received from a causa essendi (the divine cause).
- **Subsistence** - the mode of existence; creatures' essences do not subsist apart from existence; God subsists by his essence.
- **Metaphysical cause** - God as causa essendi, grounding contingency.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for essence/existence and divine simplicity in systematic theology and philosophy of religion.
- As a **polemic** tool against Avicennian separability and nominalist reductions of universals.
- As an **exegetical model** for arguing from creaturely effects to the divine cause (foundation for Thomistic natural theology).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about analogical language, the knowability of God, and the metaphysical basis for attributes (aseity, immutability).
