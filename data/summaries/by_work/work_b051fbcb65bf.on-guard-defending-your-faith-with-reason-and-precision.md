### TITLE
On Guard: Defending Your Faith with Reason and Precision - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Published in a popular-apologetics milieu (first edition 1998; revised editions later), emerging amid late-20th/early-21st-century revival of analytic, evidential apologetics in evangelical circles and the rise of the New Atheists. Combines contemporary cosmology, philosophy of religion, and historical apologetics for use in evangelism, campus work, and debate.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Christianity is rationally defensible; belief in God and the central Christian claims (notably the resurrection) are warranted by reasoned argument and historical evidence - hence faith can be affirmed with intellectual integrity.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Presents a *cumulative case* for theism: philosophical arguments (primarily the Kalam cosmological argument), scientific evidence (Big Bang, fine-tuning), and historical argument (resurrection of Jesus). 
 - Uses formal logic and probability reasoning to assess evidential weight and to respond to objections. 
 - Applies the case in a practical evangelistic/debate format: how to engage skeptics persuasively and precisely.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Scientific: Big Bang cosmology, inflationary cosmology, Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem, fine-tuning literature. 
 - Philosophical/theological interlocutors: classical skeptics and atheists (e.g., Richard Dawkins as representative popular critic), philosophers of religion (engagements with Plantinga, Mackie-like critics), historical Jesus scholars and skeptical historians. 
 - Past apologetic tradition: Thomistic and classical natural theology resources adapted into analytic form.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Existence of God** (main focus); metaphysical attributes implicated (causality, immateriality, personhood). 
 - **Revelation and knowability** (natural theology vs. revealed testimony). 
 - **Christology/Resurrection** as historical-theological anchor for Christian truth-claims. 
- **Closing line capturing theological gravity:** 
 The work argues that Christian theism is not only a matter of faith but a rational position grounded in philosophical argument, scientific evidence, and historical enquiry - enabling believers to "stand guard" intellectually for the faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - **Kalam cosmological argument** presented in clear, analytic steps: (1) whatever begins to exist has a cause; (2) the universe began to exist; (3) therefore the universe has a cause - argued to be personal and transcendent. 
 - Integration of contemporary cosmology and fine-tuning arguments with classical metaphysical reasoning.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Moves beyond vague natural theology toward *precision*: formal premises, attention to probabilistic assessment, responses to scientific objections (e.g., steady-state models, multiverse proposals). 
 - Contrasts with fideism and presuppositionalism by insisting on evidential warrant; contrasts with simple evidentialism by constructing a cumulative, interdisciplinary case.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Popularizes analytic philosophical vocabulary (inference to best explanation, probability talk) in evangelical apologetics; operationalizes cosmological physics (BGV theorem, fine-tuning) for philosophical theism.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely used in evangelical and conservative Reformed circles as an introductory apologetic manual; influential in campus ministries and seminary apologetics courses. 
 - Criticized by some Reformed and continental theologians for over-reliance on scientistic readings and for underplaying confessional/doctrinal contours of faith, but broadly respected for rigor.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Teaches disciplined argument construction, cross-disciplinary engagement (philosophy+science+history), and practical application in evangelism and debate; a model for analytic apologetics training.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kalam Cosmological Argument:** Premise-driven argument that the universe began to exist and therefore has a cause; Craig emphasizes personal causation.
- **BGV Theorem:** Cosmological result used to argue for a beginning of spacetime (supporting premise that universe began to exist).
- **Fine-Tuning:** Argument from the apparent adjustment of physical constants; used as evidence for design or a life-permitting fundament.
- **Cumulative Case:** Method of combining distinct arguments (philosophical, scientific, historical) to support theism cumulatively rather than relying on a single proof.
- **Inference to the Best Explanation (IBE):** Epistemic strategy Craig uses especially in the resurrection and design arguments.
- **Contingency/Necessity:** Ontological distinction employed in cosmological reasoning to argue for a necessary (non-contingent) being as ultimate cause.
- **Personal Cause:** Craig's claim that the first cause must be a personal agent (to account for creation ex nihilo and willful origination of time).
- **Probabilistic Reasoning:** Use of probability and evidence-weight assessments to show that Christian claims (e.g., resurrection) are more probable than naturalist alternatives.
- **Historical Apologetics / Resurrection Argument:** Application of historical criteria to argue that Jesus' resurrection is the best explanation of the data (empty tomb, eyewitness testimony, origin of Christianity).
- **Natural Theology vs. Revelation:** Balance between evidential natural theology and the authority of Christian testimony - both given epistemic weight.
- **Evidential Apologetics:** Craig's methodological category; emphasis on evidence rather than presuppositional demands.
- **Multiverse Objection / Naturalistic Replies:** Common counter-arguments Craig addresses regarding fine-tuning and origins.
- **Metaphysical Personalism:** Underlies the claim that God, as cause, possesses will, agency and the ability to create time.
- **Properly Basic Belief (interaction):** Craig interacts with the notion but prefers evidential support over solely basic-belief claims.

- How this work is used across loci: 
 - As a **definition source** for contemporary formulations of the Kalam argument and fine-tuning apologetics. 
 - As a **polemic/manual** in evangelistic and debate contexts - model for engaging New Atheist critiques. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in curricula bridging philosophy of religion, apologetics, and introductory theology (training in argument form and evidential assessment).
