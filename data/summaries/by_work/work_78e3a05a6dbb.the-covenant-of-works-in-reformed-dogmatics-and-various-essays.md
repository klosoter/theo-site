### TITLE
The Covenant of Works - Herman Bavinck (sections in Gereformeerde Dogmatiek / Reformed Dogmatics; essays including "What If Adam Had Not Sinned")

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th - early 20th century Dutch Reformed theology; Bavinck writes within the orthodox-reformed tradition while engaging modern critical scholarship. Reformed Dogmatics (1895-1901) synthesizes scholastic, patristic, biblical, and contemporary sources.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Genesis account presupposes a real, juridical covenant between God and Adam: obedience promised life, disobedience threatened death. This "Covenant of Works" explains the legal/relational foundation for sin, punishment, and the necessity of the Covenant of Grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical grounding: Gen 2:16-17 and the Eden narrative construed as a covenantal probation. 
 - Theological construction: Adam as federal head; obedience merited life for himself and descendants; disobedience merited death and alienation.
 - Polemical defense: responds to objections that Genesis lacks explicit covenantal language or that creation is purely gratuitous; defends a juridical reading without collapsing into moralism or works-righteousness.
 - Speculative/illustrative treatment: essay "What If Adam Had Not Sinned" explores the hypothetical consequences of Adam's perseverance to clarify merit, reward, and divine purpose.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed scholastics, Calvin, Westminster divines, Cocceius, Kuyper, and contemporary critics of federal theology; uses patristic and medieval witnesses alongside modern biblical-critical insights.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (works and grace), anthropology (original righteousness), hamartiology, soteriology (imputation, Christ as Second Adam), divine justice and mercy, law and gospel.
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck affirms a covenantal, juridical reading of Eden that secures both the seriousness of Adam's failure and the coherence of Christ's obedience as the decisive remedy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balances juridical/legal and relational/personal dimensions of the covenant: not merely a test but a binding, promissory arrangement tied to Adam's headship.
 - Clarifies reward language: obedience legitimately accrues the promised life; this is not meritorious in a Pelagian sense but covenantal and forensic.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - More historically and exegetically cautious than some orthodox scholastics who read anachronistic legal categories into Genesis; yet firmer than some modern critics who deny any covenantal structure.
 - Corrects pietistic or moralistic caricatures by insisting on objective federal headship and imputation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of careful distinctions between promise and gift, condition and reward, and between historical fact and theological hypothetic (evident in "What If Adam Had Not Sinned").
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in 20th-21st century Reformed theology for its scholarly rigor and pastoral clarity; frequently cited in contemporary defenses of federal theology and debates over federal headship and imputation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a balanced model for treating Genesis 2-3 within systematic theology: historically informed, exegetically restrained, and theologically integrated with Christology and soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall covenant between God and Adam promising life for perfect obedience and threatening death for disobedience.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - The post-fall arrangement by which God provides redemption in Christ; related to but distinct from the covenant of works.
- **Federal Headship (Federalism)**
 - Adam represents humanity; his act is imputed to his posterity; Christ as Second Adam reverses the federal consequences.
- **Imputation**
 - The forensic transfer of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness to humans; central to Bavinck's covenantal schema.
- **Original Righteousness**
 - Adam's created state of uprightness and ability to obey; the positive object of the covenant's promise.
- **Probation**
 - The covenantal condition in Eden: a real test with established consequences; Bavinck treats it as juridical rather than merely experimental.
- **Merit / Reward**
 - Obedience in the covenant legitimately merits the promised life; Bavinck insists on a covenantal logic of reward without endorsing merit apart from grace.
- **Second Adam / Christology**
 - Christ as federal representative whose obedience secures life for the elect; covenant of works frames Christ's redemptive role.
- **Promise and Threat**
 - Two-sided structure of the covenant: divine promise of life and threat of death; both juridically binding.
- **Law and Command**
 - The moral command in Eden functions as the covenantal condition; not mere natural law but binding covenant law.
- **Hypothetical History ("What If Adam Had Not Sinned")**
 - Bavinck uses counterfactual reflection to illuminate the nature of recompense, continuity of divine purpose, and the meaning of Christ's work.
- **Prelapsarian vs Postlapsarian**
 - Distinction between the state before and after the Fall; informs doctrine of original righteousness and subsequent grace.
- **Covenant Administration**
 - How God governs the covenantal relationship across epochs; includes promises, penalties, and mediatorial provisions.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Definition source: standard Reformed articulation of the covenant of works for dogmatic entries on covenants, original righteousness, and federal headship.
 - Exegetical and polemical pivot: deployed against views that deny Eden's covenantal structure and in clarifying the necessity and nature of Christ's mediatorial obedience.
