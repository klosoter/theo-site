### TITLE
Believer's Baptism: Sign of the New Covenant in Christ - Stephen Wellum & Thomas Schreiner 
Concise defence of credobaptism within a covenantal framework that reinterprets the circumcision-baptism typology and argues that baptism is the new-covenant sign given to professing members of the church.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical debate (21st century) amid renewed engagement between Baptists and Reformed paedobaptists.
 - Situated in broader discussions of covenant theology, church membership, and sacramental theology in North American evangelicalism.
 - Responds to both classic Reformed paedobaptist positions and recent scholarly appeals to continuity between the covenants.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** Baptism is the sign and seal of the new covenant promised in Scripture and is intended for believers (those who profess faith) rather than for infants; household baptism texts do not warrant infant inclusion as covenant members.
 - Core problem addressed: how to understand the relation of circumcision and baptism and what the new covenant's promises mean for covenant membership and sacramental administration.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: exegetical analysis of key Old and New Testament texts (Jeremiah 31; Ezekiel; Luke-Acts household narratives; Pauline corpus), theological reflection within covenant theology, and ecclesiological implications.
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the nature of the new covenant as explicitly promised to regenerate faith and internal transformation (Jeremiah/Ezekiel).
 - Demonstrate that baptism functions as the new-covenant sign/seal signifying union with Christ by faith, not mere ethnic or parental status.
 - Reassess typology: circumscription of circumcision as an ethnic, national sign tied to the Sinai/Abrahamic administration, whereas baptism is eschatological and united to faith in Christ.
 - Address household baptisms and baptismal practice in the apostolic church, arguing these do not equate to baptizing infants as covenant members without profession.
 - Draw out ecclesiological consequences: membership, discipline, pastoral practice, and sacramental instruction oriented to professing faith.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages classical Reformed paedobaptist tradition (exponents from Calvin through modern covenant theologians) and contemporary paedobaptist scholars.
 - Dialogues with modern baptismal scholarship in New Testament studies and with Baptist theologians; uses standard exegetical resources (text-critical and theological commentaries).
 - Implicitly counters common paedobaptist appeals to continuity and household-baptism evidence.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace, covenant signs)
 - Ecclesiology (church membership, visible/invisible church)
 - Sacramental theology (sign, seal, means)
 - Soteriology (union with Christ, regeneration)
 - Biblical hermeneutics and typology

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers the argument that baptism, as the new-covenant sign, coheres with a covenant theology that privileges regenerate profession and union with Christ rather than ethnic or infant inclusion.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes covenant continuity so that continuity does not demand identical sign administration; stresses **typological discontinuity** in who receives the sign.
 - Strong exegetical pressure on Jeremiah/Ezekiel to ground covenant promises in inward regeneration, thus excluding infant baptism as their primary referent.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Corrects classical paedobaptist readings that equate household baptism with automatic infant inclusion; argues many paedobaptist moves conflate promise with outward sign administration.
 - Contrasts with a simple one-to-one continuity model (circumcision -> infant baptism) by insisting on faith-union as the hermeneutical key.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and sharpens language around **sign vs. seal**, and develops the rubric of **new-covenant ecclesiology** that centers regenerate membership.
 - Distinguishes more carefully between **administrative continuity** (presence of a sign) and **ontological continuity** (who the covenant actually addresses).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in evangelical Baptist circles and among confessional Baptists seeking covenantal defenses of credobaptism.
 - Provoked renewed exchange with Reformed paedobaptist interlocutors; used in seminary debates and denominational discussions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for its concentrated exegetical case, clear covenant-theological framing, and practical ecclesial implications; useful for classroom, pulpit, and polemical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Believer's baptism** - Baptism administered to professing believers as the sign/seal of union with Christ and new-covenant membership.
- **Paedobaptism** - Infant baptism; treated as the primary rival thesis and critically examined.
- **New covenant** - The eschatological covenant inaugurated in Christ characterized by internal renewal and faith; the core referent for baptismal sign.
- **Sign and seal** - Functional categories: baptism is both visible sign and confirming seal of God's promise to believers.
- **Circumcision-baptism typology** - Comparative framework re-evaluated to show discontinuity in who receives the sign.
 - Sub-contrast: circumcision as ethnic/administrative; baptism as faith-union/eschatological.
- **Regenerate membership** - The view that church membership and sign administration presuppose or imply transformative faith.
- **Household baptism texts** - Acts and Pauline passages describing household baptisms; exegetically nuanced to resist straightforward infant-baptism conclusions.
- **Visible / invisible church** - Ecclesiological distinctions used to align sacramental practice with professing membership and covenant fidelity.
- **Union with Christ** - Theological basis for baptism's meaning: baptism signifies believer's union, not mere descent.
- **Covenant of grace** - Framework for relating Old and New Testament covenants; reshaped to support credobaptism.
- **Typological discontinuity** - Key hermeneutical claim that typology does not require identical administration.
- **Profession of faith** - Practical and theological prerequisite for baptism in this schema.
- **Sacramental administration** - Pastoral implications for admission, catechesis, discipline.

- How this work is used:
 - As a **definition source** and systematic defense for credobaptism within a covenantal framework.
 - As a **polemic** against paedobaptist readings of covenant continuity and household baptism texts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for applying Jeremiah/Ezekiel-New Testament correspondences to sacramental theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiology courses to argue for regenerate membership and baptismal practice.
