### TITLE
**The Kingdom of God and the Church** - Geerhardus Vos (Princeton, early 20th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton Reformed theology; reaction against liberal moralizing of the kingdom and dispensational fragmentation.
 - Part of Vos's broader project of redemptive-historical biblical theology; interacts with Calvinist covenant tradition and contemporary figures (Kuyper, Warfield) and polemically with dispensationalists and theological liberals.
- **Central thesis**
 - The *kingdom of God* is the historical, covenantal rule of God culminating in Christ; the *church* is the concrete, sacramental and juridical manifestation of that kingdom in history - present in germ, consummated in eschaton.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical exegetical tracing: OT promises -> Jewish expectation -> NT inauguration in Christ.
 - Christ as center: His messianic consciousness, mission and the munus triplex (prophet, priest, king) realize the kingdom.
 - Church as instrument and sign: ecclesial sacraments (especially baptism) mediate covenant incorporation; the church witnesses and advances the kingdom presently while awaiting consummation.
 - Soteriological and ethical consequences: positions Vos on definitive union with Christ (positional sanctification) and progressive sanctification (ethical outworking).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture via redemptive-historical method; dialogues implicitly with Calvinist covenant writers, Kuyperian cultural theology, Warfield, and opponents in dispensationalism and liberal theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, covenant theology, Christology (messianic consciousness), soteriology (union with Christ; sanctification), ecclesiology (nature and office of the church), sacraments (baptism), eschatology (inaugurated vs consummate kingdom), common/preparatory grace.
- **Closing line**
 - Vos locates the church as the covenantal, sacramental embodiment of the inaugurated kingdom: Christ's person and offices give the kingdom its historical reality and teleology, the church its mediating role, and redemptive history the frame for all doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Redemptive-historical hermeneutic**
 - Emphasizes organic, historical continuity of God's redemptive acts over schematic, system-first theology.
- **Kingdom-church unity**
 - Rejects sharp separation (dispensational) and purely ethical redefinition (liberal); treats church as manifestation and instrument of the kingdom, not its totality.
- **Sacramental-covenantal posture**
 - Baptism is read as covenant sign (analogue to circumcision); supports **infant baptism** as covenant inclusion while distinguishing sign from automatic regeneration (efficacy as covenantal incorporation, not immediate sanctification).
- **Sanctification framed as both definitive and progressive**
 - Distinguishes positional, definitive sanctification in union with Christ from the progressive moral and spiritual growth of believers in history.
- **Common and preparatory grace**
 - Articulates a form of common/preparatory grace: God's non-saving restraining and providential action prepares hearts and cultures for the gospel; this supports mission and cultural engagement without collapsing into universalism.
- **Christological focus - messianic consciousness and munus triplex**
 - Treats Jesus as consciously fulfilling prophetic, priestly and kingly offices; His self-awareness and mission inaugurate the kingdom, giving theological grounding for ecclesial offices and mission.
- **Reception**
 - Deep influence on Reformed biblical theology; foundational for subsequent Princeton and neo-Calvinist work and later scholars who emphasize redemptive-historical reading (enduring corrective to dispensational and liberal readings).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kingdom of God**
 - Inaugurated-but-not-consummated reign; historical redemptive rule centered in Christ.
- **Church**
 - Covenant community and sacramental instrument of the kingdom; visible and eschatological dimensions.
- **Covenant**
 - Structural hermeneutic: continuity of promises and fulfillments shapes kingdom history.
- **Redemptive-historical method**
 - Scripture read as unfolding divine acts culminating in Christ; avoids abstracted proof-texting.
- **Baptism (infant vs believer)**
 - **Infant baptism**: covenant sign of inclusion analogous to circumcision; legitimate within covenant continuity.
 - **Efficacy**: baptism effects covenantal incorporation, not automatic regeneration - requires faith's actualization in the elect.
- **Sanctification (definitive and progressive)**
 - **Definitive**: positional holiness in union with Christ (already); **Progressive**: ethical and moral growth lived out in history (not merely positional).
- **Common grace / Preparatory grace**
 - Common grace: restraining, providential good in non-elect; preparatory grace: God's means of preparing persons/cultures to receive the gospel without effecting saving faith.
- **Christ's messianic consciousness**
 - Jesus' self-understanding and mission-commitment as Messiah who inaugurates the kingdom; an historical-theological datum in Vos's account.
- **Munus triplex (prophet, priest, king)**
 - Christ's integrated offices explain kingdom dynamics and ecclesial functions (preaching, atonement/mediation, governance).
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Present-realities and future consummation held in tension.
- **Sacramental-covenantal efficacy**
 - Signs convey covenant relationship; pastoral implications for catechesis and discipline.
- **Kingdom-church relation**
 - Church as instrument and manifestation, not synonymous with kingdom's fullness.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for kingdom theology and covenantal ecclesiology.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational and liberal reconstructions of the kingdom.
 - As an **exegetical model** for redemptive-historical readings of OT/NT kingdom texts.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental theology (baptismal covenantal inclusion) and in framing sanctification (definitive/progressive).
