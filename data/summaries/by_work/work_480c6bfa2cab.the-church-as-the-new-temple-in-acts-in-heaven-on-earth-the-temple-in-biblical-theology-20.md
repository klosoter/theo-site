### TITLE
"The Church as the New Temple in Acts" - David W. Pao, in Heaven on Earth: The Temple in Biblical Theology (2004)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in a 2004 collective volume oriented to biblical-theological readings of temple imagery; engages late 20th-early 21st century Lukan studies and renewed interest in Second Temple and temple-theology.
 - Positioned within narrative and typological approaches to Luke-Acts; dialogue with both historical-critical and theological readings of the New Testament.
 - Site usage: cited under the topic **Typology And Fulfillment** (single reference in this library).

- **Central thesis**
 - Acts portrays the emerging Christian community as the **new temple**: the locus of God's presence and cultic function is transferred from the Jerusalem temple to the church through narrative and theological moves in Luke-Acts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Shows how Lukan narrative relocates divine presence:
 - **Pentecost** (Acts 2) signals Spirit-fulfillment of temple presence.
 - **Stephen's speech and martyrdom** reinterpret temple expectations and accuse Israel of failing in its temple vocation.
 - **Pauline and missionary scenes** demonstrate the church performing priestly and prophetic functions formerly associated with the temple.
 - Argues typological continuity: Luke treats Israel's temple as a foreshadowing that finds fulfillment and transformation in the church rather than simple abolition or mere metaphor.
 - Emphasizes spatial rhetoric and cultic language across episodes to demonstrate systematic authorial intent.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages contemporary Lukan scholarship and broader temple-theology literature (Second Temple Judaism, temple symbolism in early Christian interpretation).
 - Dialogues implicitly with views that either minimize temple imagery in Luke-Acts or maintain a strictly symbolic reading detached from cultic function.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology** (church as locus of divine presence/priestly people)
 - **Pneumatology** (Spirit as actualizing temple presence)
 - **Christology** (Jesus as fulfilment of temple function)
 - **Eschatology** (realization of eschatological presence now)
 - **Covenant / Revelation** (continuity of God's covenantal dwelling)
 - Ancillary treatment of priesthood, sacred space, and mission.

- **Closing line**
 - Pao locates Luke-Acts squarely in a typological economy: the church is the inaugurated, living temple in which God's eschatological presence now dwells and acts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses the *spatial-transference* of divine presence from physical temple to communal church, using narrative mapping rather than abstract doctrinal assertion.
 - Treats Pentecost as both pneumatological event and cultic inauguration of the church-as-temple.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that reduce temple language to mere metaphor or that insist the Jerusalem temple retains unchanged cultic primacy after Pentecost.
 - Nuances debates that isolate Paul from Luke by reading Luke-Acts as coherently temple-centered in its own right.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the category of **temple-function** (presence + priestly action + sacred space) rather than only the category of "temple imagery."
 - Employs a typology of fulfillment that highlights institutional and functional continuity (not merely rhetorical fulfillment).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted by scholars interested in ecclesiology, pneumatology, and biblical theologies of space; useful in courses on Luke-Acts and temple motifs.
 - Influential for readings that integrate narrative, typology, and cultic studies; serves as corrective to strictly propositional or ahistorical ecclesiologies.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined way to read theological motifs across narrative unit boundaries.
 - Provides a robust exegetical framework for connecting Spirit, church, and temple in preaching, teaching, and further research.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Temple** - The church as the incarnated locus of God's dwelling in Acts.
- **Divine Presence (Shekinah / Presence motif)** - Realized in the Spirit-empowered community rather than confined to a building.
- **Pentecost** - The narrative fulcrum signaling inauguration of temple presence in the church.
- **Holy Spirit (Pneumatology)** - Agent effecting the transference and enabling temple functions (worship, witness, priestly mediation).
- **Priesthood of the People** - The community assumes priestly roles formerly attached to temple cult.
- **Typology and Fulfillment** - Pao's hermeneutical lens: Israel's temple foreshadows and finds functional fulfillment in the church.
- **Sacred Space / Temple Geography** - Luke's narrative relocates sacred geography from Jerusalem to dispersed Christian gatherings.
- **Temple Cult / Function** - Emphasis on cultic action (sacrifice, intercession, presence) rather than architectural permanence.
- **Eschatological Fulfillment** - Present realization of promised dwelling in the age-to-come.
- **Lukan Narrative Theology** - Reading Acts as theological story with coherent redemptive-historical moves.
- **Stephen as Temple Critique** - Uses Stephen to show Luke's polemic against Israel's failure to be temple-people.
- **Mission as Temple-Activity** - Evangelism and witness construed as priestly service extending God's presence.
- **Relocation / Transference** - Key term for how presence/function shifts from stone temple to living community.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading temple motifs in Luke-Acts and for connecting narrative events to theological claims.
 - As a **definition source** for the typology-and-fulfillment approach to temple theology, especially where ecclesiology and pneumatology intersect.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecclesiological reflection (church identity as locus of presence) and in polemical engagement with temple-centric interpretations.
