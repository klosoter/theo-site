### TITLE
Always On: Practicing Faith In A New Media Landscape - Angela W. Gorrell

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary digital-media era: 21st-century shift to ubiquitous connectivity, social platforms, and mobile devices.
 - Situated in practical theology, pastoral theology, and digital/mediated religion studies; addresses churches negotiating formation under conditions of constant connectivity.
 - Conversant with media theory and Christian formation literature; written for pastors, lay leaders, and theological students.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** The "always on" media environment reshapes attention, memory, community, and embodiment such that Christian formation must recover and reconfigure practices (liturgical, spiritual, ethical) that form discipleship in a mediated culture.
 - **Problem:** How can ecclesial practices preserve theological ends (worship, sacrament, neighbor-love) when media habits fragment attention, trivialize presence, and reframe identity?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic stage: describes how constant connectivity affects Christian life (attention scarcity, curated selves, networked solitude).
 - Theological resources: recovers classical and contemporary resources for practice-based formation (liturgy, Sabbath, hospitality, confession, embodied habit).
 - Practical proposals: recommends specific practices and pedagogies that cultivate attentiveness, discernment, and embodied community in media-saturated contexts.
 - Pastoral implications: offers guidance for congregational rhythms, preaching, pastoral care, and digital policy shaped by theological virtues rather than technological determinism.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Interdisciplinary: media theorists and sociologists of technology (e.g., McLuhan-style media awareness, critics of attention economy), psychologists of attention and habit.
 - Theological interlocutors: contemporary formation theologians and virtue ethicists (e.g., James K. A. Smith-style liturgical formation, Dallas Willard/virtue ethics influences), liturgical theology on practice and embodiment.
 - Pastoral and congregational studies: draws on case studies or pastoral examples to show practice application.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Ecclesiology:** community formation, sacramental life, worship practice in mediated spaces.
 - **Anthropology:** attention, embodiment, identity, memory as shaped by media.
 - **Ethics / Virtue:** habituation, discernment, stewardship of attention and time.
 - **Liturgical theology / Spiritual formation:** practices as means of grace; redemption of practices in new contexts.
 - Secondary engagement: revelation (mediation of the Word), pastoral theology, occasional ecclesial polity implications.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Faithful discipleship requires intentional, embodied practices that reorder attention and community so the church can embody Christ amid an "always-on" media ecology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Places **attention** and habituation at center-stage as theological categories - not merely psychological problems but loci of spiritual formation.
 - Marries media ecology analysis with classical practice theory: shows how liturgical and communal practices can be adapted (not abandoned) for digital contexts.
 - Strong pastoral orientation: concrete practices and congregational rhythms rather than abstract tech ethics.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on both techno-utopianism (which assumes media improves community by default) and techno-pessimism (which counsels rejection). Advocates mediated prudence: critique + selective appropriation.
 - More practice-focused than works that emphasize doctrine-first responses to technology; reinscribes doctrine through formation.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Treats "always-on" as a theological category for contemporary discipleship.
 - Frames digital behaviors as modern "liturgies" or formative practices that require theological discernment and reformation.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Taken up in practical theology, pastoral formation programs, and digital ministry training.
 - Influential among clergy and seminary instructors seeking actionable frameworks; less a systematic dogmatic intervention than a praxis-oriented resource.
 - Resonates across denominational lines; notable uptake in congregational renewal contexts and digital chaplaincy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating media studies into spiritual formation curricula.
 - Valuable pastoral toolkit: helps churches design rhythms and policies attentive to formation amid technological change.
 - Promotes an interpretive habit for evaluating future media shifts through practice-theological lenses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Always-on**
 - Describes ubiquitous connectivity; central analytic frame for diagnosing cultural formation effects.

- **Attention**
 - Core theological-anthropological category; attention as finite resource requiring stewardship and spiritual formation.

- **Habituation / Practice**
 - Habits and embodied practices (liturgies) as primary means by which disciples are formed or deformed.

- **Digital liturgy / mediated liturgy**
 - Conceptualizes online behaviors and platform rituals as formative liturgies requiring theological assessment and shaping.

- **Embodiment**
 - Emphasizes physical presence, sensory practices, and corporeal rhythms as corrective to disembodied digital engagement.

- **Sabbath / sacred rhythm**
 - Proposed practice for reclaiming time and interrupting the attention economy; theological anchor for rest and presence.

- **Discernment**
 - Practical-theological skill for evaluating technologies and platform practices according to gospel ends.

- **Hospitality (digital hospitality)**
 - Reworked for online spaces: ethics of welcome, boundaries, and neighborly care mediated by platforms.

- **Stewardship of attention**
 - Moral and spiritual responsibility to manage time, focus, and information environments.

- **Networked solitude / curated self**
 - Descriptive terms for social effects of media that formation practices must address.

- **Sacramentality / mediated sacraments**
 - Exploration of how sacramental life and symbolic practices transfer or translate into mediated contexts.

- **Pastoral prudence**
 - Practical wisdom for leaders shaping congregational responses to media.

- **Formation pedagogy**
 - Instructional strategies for cultivating practices in congregations and households.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "always-on" discipleship and attention stewardship in syllabi and pastoral trainings.
 - As a **practical, pastoral resource** and conceptual pivot in courses on spiritual formation, liturgy, and digital ministry - offering concrete practices rather than abstract judgments.
 - As a **polemic** against unexamined technological adoption, advocating the reformation of practices to serve theological ends.
