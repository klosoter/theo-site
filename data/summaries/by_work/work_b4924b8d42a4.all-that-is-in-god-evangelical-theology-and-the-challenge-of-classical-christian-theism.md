### TITLE
**All That Is in God: Evangelical Theology and the Challenge of Classical Christian Theism - James E. Dolezal**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical and Reformed milieu reacting to late 20th-21st century developments: rise of open theism, process thought, experiential/practical theology, and a broad move in some evangelical circles away from classical metaphysics.
 - Part of a retrieval impulse among evangelicals to re-engage medieval and patristic resources for doctrine of God.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Evangelical theology must recover *classical Christian theism* (especially the doctrines of divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility, and eternity) because departures from classical metaphysics have produced incoherence in accounts of God, revelation, providence, and worship.
 - Theological task: show that classical theism is both biblically defensible and necessary for coherent doctrine.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys contemporary evangelical tendencies that relativize divine transcendence (emotional anthropomorphism, temporal change in God, equivocal conceptions of omniscience/power).
 - Retrieval: articulates classical theism as an integrated metaphysical package grounded in Scripture and the church's tradition (Augustine, Aquinas, Anselm).
 - Constructive defense: argues for divine simplicity and related attributes as the best solution to problems about divine freedom, sovereignty, knowledge, and relation to creatures.
 - Pastoral/canonical implications: explores how classical theism shapes doctrine of revelation, prayer, providence, and Christology without neglecting God's personal relation to creatures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on patristic and medieval theologians (Augustine, Anselm, Aquinas) and on modern defenders of classical theism.
 - Engages contemporary evangelical theologians and critics of classical theism (representative streams: open theism, process theology, some relational/experiential evangelicals).
 - Philosophical interlocution with analytic debates over divine attributes (simplicity, timelessness, omniscience).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of God (metaphysics of God; attributes)
 - Trinity (implications of simplicity and relation)
 - Providence and sovereignty
 - Revelation and Scripture (divine speech and immutability)
 - Christology (implications for the incarnation and divine-human relation)
 - Theodicy and prayer (how attributes bear on suffering and petition)

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers evangelical theology on a recovered classical theism: God as the metaphysical ground of all perfections, whose transcendence secures coherent talk of revelation, sovereignty, and worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that **divine simplicity** is not an optional metaphysical gloss but central to orthodox theism and necessary for coherent doctrine.
 - Integration of metaphysical precision with pastoral and doctrinal concerns-classical attributes defended for both intellectually and ecclesially formative reasons.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against open theism and process views that read biblical language as indicating change in God's nature; argues these undermine divine sovereignty and the reliability of God's promises.
 - Contrasts with some modern evangelical pragmatic approaches that privilege relational/experiential depictions over metaphysical coherence.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reclaims classical categories (simplicity, aseity, impassibility, timelessness) for evangelical usage while attempting to reframe them in biblically sensitive ways.
 - Emphasizes an integrative "all-in-God" vision: God contains all perfections rather than being a maximal member among beings.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in conservative Reformed and classical-theist sympathetic circles as a corrective to recent trends.
 - Criticized by proponents of openness/relational theology who see classical emphases as diminishing God's relationality and responsiveness.

- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable as a clear, rigorous evangelical defense of classical theism; useful for doctrine-of-God courses, debates over divine attributes, and for those seeking an integrated historical-theological resource.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Classical theism** - The traditional Christian metaphysical view: God is simple, immutable, timeless, omnipotent, omniscient, and the ultimate ground of being.
- **Divine simplicity** - God is not composite; God's attributes are identical with His essence; avoids treating attributes as separable parts.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence and independence; God is causa sui and lacks ontological dependence on creation.
- **Immutability** - God does not undergo intrinsic change; safeguards reliability of divine promises and covenantal faithfulness.
- **Impassibility** - God is not subject to external passions or uncontrolled emotional change; preserves God's sovereignty and holiness.
- **Eternity / Timelessness** - God exists outside (or above) temporal succession; Dolezal defends a classical eternalist understanding against temporalist readings.
- **Transcendence vs. Immanence** - Emphasizes God's radical otherness (transcendence) while affirming genuine relation and presence to creation (immanence) without metaphysical compromise.
- **Omniscience / Omnipotence** - Treated within the framework of simplicity and aseity so that God's knowledge and power are coherent with immutability and freedom.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - Language about God is analogical, preserving both similarity and dissimilarity between God and creatures.
- **Theological retrieval** - The methodological posture of reclaiming historical theological categories for contemporary evangelicalism.
- **Divine attributes (integrated view)** - Attributes are not add-ons but expressions of one divine essence.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical attribute terminology in evangelical curricula.
 - As a **polemic resource** against open theism, process theology, and relational minimalism.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating historical metaphysics with evangelical commitments to Scripture, providence, and worship.
