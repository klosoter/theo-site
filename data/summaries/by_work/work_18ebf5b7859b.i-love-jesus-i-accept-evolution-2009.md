### TITLE
I Love Jesus & I Accept Evolution (2009) - Denis O. Lamoureux

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2009 amid intensifying evangelical debates over origins (young-earth creationism, intelligent design, and theistic evolution).
 - Author an evangelical biologist/theologian; book addresses lay and church audiences seeking reconciliation of orthodox faith with evolutionary science.
 - Engages the long-running "science vs. Scripture" conversation with special focus on Genesis 1-11.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - One can be a faithful Christian and fully accept evolutionary biology: God created through evolution. The perceived conflict arises from hermeneutical errors, not scientific evidence.
 - Doctrinal problem addressed: how to reconcile biblical authority (especially Genesis 1-11) with mainstream science without compromising Christian confession.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Personal testimony establishes intellectual and pastoral stakes (the provocative title frames the wager).
 - Exposition of relevant science: evidence for common descent, deep time, mechanisms of evolution.
 - Biblical-theological critique of literalist readings of Genesis 1-11:
 - Argues Genesis was written in ancient Near Eastern genres and uses accommodation to ancient cosmology.
 - Distinguishes theological intent from verifiable scientific description.
 - Proposes "evolutionary creation" (theistic evolution) as the coherent model: God is the primary cause who providentially uses evolutionary processes as secondary causes.
 - Addresses traditional theological concerns (original sin, image of God, Adam and Eve) by reframing them in non-concordist categories - emphasizes theological function over scientific historicity.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Dialogues with young-earth creationist movement (e.g., Answers in Genesis), intelligent design proponents, historical science (Darwin), and evangelical scholars who insist on literal Genesis exegesis.
 - Draws on Scripture, ancient Near Eastern comparative material, and contemporary evolutionary biology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (accommodation and authorial intent)
 - Creation and providence (God as creator who works through natural processes)
 - Anthropology (image of God, Adam and Eve)
 - Sin and atonement (original sin and the need for Christ)
 - Hermeneutics (literalism vs. literary/ancient cultural reading)

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically orthodox faith need not fear evolution; the deeper unity is found by reading Genesis as theological witness, letting science answer how God providentially brings about creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong advocacy of "evolutionary creation" framed as both scientifically honest and theologically faithful.
 - Emphasis on *accommodation* - biblical authors wrote within ancient scientific assumptions; Scripture's purpose is salvific, not scientific instruction.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Direct corrective to literalist/concordist readings of Genesis 1-11 and to the "conflict thesis" that pits Christianity against science.
 - Contrasts with intelligent design by insisting that invoking God as primary cause does not require rejecting natural mechanisms or the explanatory power of evolutionary theory.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clear popular synthesis of two-books idea: book of Scripture (salvation truth) vs. book of nature (mechanistic detail), while refusing strict NOMA by allowing theological claims about meaning without making Scripture a scientific textbook.
 - Reframes Adam/Eve and original sin in terms that allow for theological universality without necessitating a single pair as the exclusive genetic progenitors.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received among progressive evangelicals and those seeking pastoral resources to teach evolution-friendly faith.
 - Criticized by young-earth advocates as capitulation; by some conservative scholars as insufficiently protective of biblical historicity.
 - Used as an accessible bridge text in seminaries, churches, and apologetics circles.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pastoral-theological model for integrating orthodox Christian faith with mainstream evolutionary science.
 - Useful for teaching hermeneutical humility and for reframing debates away from forced literalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evolutionary creation / theistic evolution**
 - Terminology Lamoureux prefers: God creates through evolutionary processes; affirms both divine agency and scientific mechanisms.

- **Accommodation**
 - Biblical authors accommodated ancient cosmology; Scripture communicates redemptive truth in culturally-bound categories.

- **Two-books model**
 - Book of Scripture (theological/salvific truth) vs. Book of Nature (empirical, mechanistic truth); complementary but not identical in function.

- **Concordism vs. non-concordism**
 - Rejection of concordist insistence that biblical text must map to modern scientific descriptions; advocates a non-concordist reading that preserves theological intent.

- **Genesis 1-11 as ANE literature**
 - Reads early Genesis in light of ancient Near Eastern genres and polemics, especially anti-polytheistic and functional creation emphases.

- **Historical Adam (treatment)**
 - Treats Adam/Eve claims theologically rather than insisting on biological single-pair origins; allows corporate/representative readings compatible with population genetics.

- **Original sin (reframing)**
 - Focuses on corporate human rebellion and universal culpability rather than a genetic transmission model tied to a literal first couple.

- **Image of God (functional reading)**
 - Emphasizes relational/functional dimensions (dominion, stewardship, relationality) that can apply to evolved humans.

- **Divine providence and chance**
 - Accepts stochastic processes in evolution while affirming God's providential governance.

- **Hermeneutical humility**
 - Calls for restraint in forcing modern science onto ancient texts.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: standard accessible statement of evangelical evolutionary creation for churches and students.
 - Polemic: a concise counter-argument to young-earth creationism and intelligent design within evangelical contexts.
 - Exegetical model: a practical template for reading Genesis 1-11 as theological, non-scientific testimony.
 - Conceptual pivot: used in curricula and conversations to move communities from literalist conflict to integrationist dialogue.
