### TITLE
**The Return of Christ (De Wederkomst van Christus)** - G. C. Berkouwer

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Dutch Reformed theology; part of Berkouwer's wider dogmatic enterprise. Written against the background of renewed interest in eschatology after World War II, reaction to both sensational popular eschatologies (dispensational premillennialism) and certain liberal/critical reductions of "last things."
 - Conversation partners include classic Reformed sources (Calvin, Kuyper), neo-orthodoxy (Karl Barth), existentialist critique (Rudolf Bultmann), and contemporary popular eschatological movements.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The second coming of Christ must be understood as a concrete, personal, and decisive future event that shapes Christian faith, hope, and life; eschatology is Christocentric and resists speculative chronology, spiritualizing reductions, and both extremes of over-realized and purely deferred hope.
 - **Berkouwer stakes a middle path:** eschatology is neither merely symbolic nor a technical timetable, but the promised consummation that already shapes present existence through the Spirit.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Biblical exegesis of New Testament texts on the return (parousia): emphasis on personal, visible, glorious return of the risen Christ.
 - Affirmation of inaugurated eschatology: the kingdom has been set in motion in Christ but awaits consummation.
 - The "already" = present reign of Christ (soteriological, ecclesial realities).
 - The "not yet" = final judgment, resurrection, renewal of creation.
 - Rejection of date-setting, sensational sign-chasing, and abstract apocalypticism; critique of both liberal demythologizing and literalist dispensationalism.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications: the return governs worship, sacraments, hope, and moral vigilance.
 - Pneumatological role: the Spirit is the present guarantee and power of the coming age, ensuring eschatological certainty without chronological precision.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture as primary authority; engages Calvin and classic Reformed exegesis; dialogues critically with Barth, Bultmann, dispensational writers, and emerging ecumenical voices.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (center), Christology (person and work of the returning Christ), Pneumatology (Spirit as pledge/guarantor), Ecclesiology & Sacraments (signs pointing to the consummation), Soteriology (final glorification and judgment), Anthropology & Creation (resurrection, new creation), Revelation and covenantal promise.

- **Closing line**
 - **Berkouwer insists the return of Christ is the concrete horizon that orders Christian hope and ethics: a personal, visible consummation inaugurated now by Christ and the Spirit but awaited in faith.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the personal, visible character of Christ's return (against purely "spiritualized" parousia).
 - Balanced articulation of the **"already-and-not-yet"** that avoids speculative chronology while maintaining future certitude.
 - Pastoral orientation: eschatology framed to sustain congregational hope and ethical vigilance rather than curiosity about signs.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensationalism by denying secret rapture, detachable prophetic timetables, and dual-covenant schemas.
 - Counters Bultmann-style demythologizing by affirming historicity and future bodily realities.
 - Modifies Barthian caution about futurity by re-emphasizing the objective future event without returning to pre-critical speculation.

- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Systematic use of "inaugurated consummation" language (early expression of inaugurated eschatology within a Reformed dogmatic frame).
 - Stress on the Spirit as "guarantee" for eschatological promise (bridging pneumatology and future hope).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly regarded in Reformed circles as a sober, biblically grounded corrective to extremes; widely cited in Dutch and wider Reformed scholarship.
 - Influenced later ecumenical discussions on hope and was a reference point for pastoral-theological treatments of eschatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches restraint in eschatological speculation while preserving the urgency and concreteness of Christian hope; valuable for preaching, sacramental theology, and teaching on the last things.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia (the Return)** - personal, visible, decisive coming of the risen Lord; not merely symbolic or purely spiritual.
- **Already / Not Yet** - inaugurated kingdom present in Christ and the Spirit, with consummation still future.
- **Inaugurated consummation** - the tension between present reality and future fulfillment.
- **Spirit as guarantee (pledge)** - the Spirit as present assurance of the promised future and power for present witness.
- **Final judgment** - objective eschatological reckoning shaping ethics and hope.
- **Resurrection / new creation** - bodily renewal and cosmic restoration as the telos of history.
- **Sacramental sign and hope** - baptism and eucharist as anticipatory signs pointing to the consummation.
- **Anti-speculation** - methodological restraint against timetables, sensationalism, and secret rapture motifs.
- **Christocentric eschatology** - eschatology grounded in the person and work of Christ rather than in detached cosmological schemata.
- **Pastoral eschatology** - emphasis on the formative effects of eschatological hope for church life and moral living.
- **Historicist vs. symbolic readings** - Berkouwer navigates between literalist historicism and purely allegorical reductions.
- **Ecclesial anticipation** - church as community of waiting and witness shaped by promised future.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed, Christocentric eschatology and for the "already-not-yet" paradigm.
 - As a **polemic resource** against dispensationalism, sensationalism, and demythologizing reductionism.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading New Testament parousia texts with ecclesial and sacramental sensitivity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking eschatology to pneumatology, sacramental theology, and pastoral ethics.
