### TITLE
**B. B. Warfield - "The Divine and Human in the Saviour's Life" (Selected Shorter Writings)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton theology; Warfield writing from within conservative Reformed orthodoxy in response to nineteenth-century liberal and kenotic trends that reinterpreted the incarnation. The essay appears among Warfield's Selected Shorter Writings as a focused Christological defense.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to speak properly of divine and human properties in the one person of Christ (communicatio idiomatum) without collapsing natures or denying genuine human limitations or divine attributes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Statement of the problem: scriptural ascriptions (e.g., "God was crucified," "He experienced hunger") force theological precision.
 - Distinction of levels of predication: attributes belong to natures but are ascribed to the one person because of the hypostatic union.
 - Rejection of ontological transfer: attributes are not transmuted between natures; rather, the person of the Word is the subject to which both sets of properties are ascribed.
 - Treatment of kenotic claims: critiques any theory that posits loss or essential diminution of divine attributes in the incarnation; instead, divine attributes remain though their exercise may be voluntarily veiled.
 - Conclusion: preserves Chalcedonian balance - full deity and full humanity united in one person without confusion, change, or division.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Chalcedonian formula and patristic theology (Athanasius, Augustine); Reformed orthodox authorities (Owen, Turretin); contemporary opponents chiefly the kenotic school and theological modernists who recast divine attributes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum), Trinity (implications for divine attributes), doctrine of attributes (omniscience, omnipresence, omnipotence), incarnation and passion.
- **Closing line:** Warfield's theological center: the personal ascription of divine and human predicates in Christ must be grounded in the hypostatic union - not by transfer of properties between natures but by a single person who truly and fully possesses both natures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precise analytic distinction between predication to a nature and predication to a person; clarity about grammatical versus ontological claims.
 - Insistence that divine attributes continue to belong to the Word even in the incarnate state, though their exercise may be voluntarily limited.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to kenoticism: opposes any metaphysical diminution of deity as incompatible with Chalcedon and orthodox attribute-theology.
 - Clarifies inadequacies in both naive literalism (which risks confusion) and radical accommodation (which risks denying deity).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of idiomatic/ontological predication vocabulary - emphasizing "ascription by virtue of union" rather than "transfer."
 - Distinguishes "real but non-confused union" as the operative metaphysical claim enabling communicatio idiomatum.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a rigorous defense of classical Christology.
 - Served as a standard polemic against early 20th-century kenotic and liberal reinterpretations; less influential in liberal scholarship but respected for argumentative clarity.
- **Enduring value:** A compact, disciplined template for teaching the communicatio idiomatum that balances patristic-Chalcedonian fidelity with critical philosophical precision.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** the ascription of properties of Christ's natures to the one person; Warfield insists this is idiomatic (by virtue of union), not a literal transfer of attributes.
- **Hypostatic union:** the personal union of divine and human natures in the one person (hypostasis) of the Word; the foundational metaphysical claim.
- **Person (hypostasis) vs. nature (physis):** person is the subject of predicates; natures supply predicates - Warfield stresses the analytic distinction to avoid confusion.
- **Ontological transfer (rejected):** the idea that properties move from one nature to another; Warfield rejects this as incoherent with orthodox Christology.
- **Idiomatic predication:** ascribing a nature's predicate to the person because the person is the bearer of both natures.
- **Kenosis / kenotic theory (critique):** theories that posit essential self-emptying or loss of divine attributes in the incarnation; Warfield critiques as unnecessary and theologically hazardous.
- **Divine attributes (omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence):** affirmed as retained by the Word; their operation in the incarnate life can be voluntarily limited but not ontologically negated.
- **Passibility / impassibility:** Warfield upholds classical impassibility of God as an attribute of the divine nature while acknowledging the real passibility of Christ in his human nature.
- **Appropriation (idiomatic appropriation):** assigning certain actions or attributes typically associated with one nature to the person because of the union.
- **Grammatical vs. metaphysical predication:** Warfield uses this distinction to show how scriptural language functions without implying metaphysical confusion.
- **Real union vs. confusion:** preservation of both reality of union and non-confusion of natures, echoing Chalcedon.
- **Subject of action:** the person of the Word is the subject who acts in history; actions may be described in terms taken from either nature.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise definitional resource for classical Christology and the communicatio idiomatum.
 - As a polemical model against kenoticism and liberal reductions of the deity of Christ.
 - As an exegetical-method exemplar showing how to read Christological predicates in Scripture without category mistakes.
