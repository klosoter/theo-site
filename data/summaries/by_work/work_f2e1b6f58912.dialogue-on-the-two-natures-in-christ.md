### TITLE
**Dialogue on the Two Natures in Christ** - Peter Martyr Vermigli 
Mid-16th-century Reformed Christological treatise clarifying person-nature relations for soteriology and the sacraments; composed in the Zurich milieu and aimed chiefly at Lutheran ubiquitarian claims.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - High Reformation, post-Marburg, intensified Eucharistic controversy between Reformed and Lutheran theologians. 
 - Zurich school retrieval of Nicene-Chalcedonian orthodoxy; use of patristic sources to legitimate Reformed positions. 
 - Likely finalized and published in the early 1560s, in Vermigli's late Zurich period.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - How the one person of Christ subsists in two distinct natures without confusion, and how this union bears on Christ's presence and mediation. 
 - Explicit denial that divine majesty is communicated to the human nature in such a way as to render Christ's body ubiquitous; affirmation of the extra Calvinisticum and spiritual presence in the Supper.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - **Person and nature:** Definition of hypostatic union; person acts through both natures undividedly; natures remain unconfused. 
 - **Communicatio idiomatum:** 
 - Affirms genus idiomaticum and apotelesmaticum. 
 - Rejects genus maiestaticum as a Nestorianizing or Eutychianizing drift in Lutheranism. 
 - **Right hand of God:** Interprets session as dignity and authority, not a localizable spatial ubiquity for the body. 
 - **Presence and ascension:** True human body remains finite and locally in heaven; the Logos is not contained by the flesh. 
 - **Eucharistic application:** 
 - No carnal or ubiquitous presence; real participation by the Spirit through faith. 
 - Sacramental signs are means of grace instrumentally, not by inherent power. 
 - **Ecclesial implications:** Christ's mediatorial reign governs Word, sacraments, and discipline; church order answers to the ascended Head.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic: **Augustine, Cyril of Alexandria, Leo the Great**, Chalcedon's Definition; occasional appeal to John of Damascus. 
 - Scholastic: **Lombard, Aquinas** as conceptual aids. 
 - Protestant interlocutors: **Brenz, Westphal**, broad Lutheran ubiquitarian front; clarifies distance from Zwinglian memorialism.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Christology** (person, natures, union, session); **sacramentology** (sign, seal, presence, efficacy); **soteriology** (mediator, communication of benefits); **ecclesiology** (marks, headship, discipline); **hermeneutics of the Fathers**.

- **Closing line:** 
 - The ascended Christ, one person in two natures without confusion, grants saving communion by the Spirit through instituted means, not by collapsing divinity into flesh.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong articulation of the **extra Calvinisticum**: the Word remains beyond the assumed flesh while truly united to it. 
 - **Right hand as status**, not spatial spread of the body. 
 - Double affirmation: real, Spirit-wrought participation; real finitude of Christ's humanity.

- **Corrections or contrasts:** 
 - Against **Lutheran genus maiestaticum** and the **ubiquity** of Christ's body. 
 - Against **Roman transubstantiation** and local, corporeal presence claims. 
 - Beyond bare memorialism: insists on **efficacious means of grace** without materializing presence. 
 - Stabilizes Reformed practice of **fencing the table**: presence is for believers; unbelief receives judgment, not benefit.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Careful delimitation of the **genera of communication**; sharp person-nature distinction. 
 - Deployment of **finitum non capax infiniti** within Chalcedonian boundaries. 
 - Exegetical reframing of **session** for sacramental and ecclesial conclusions.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Canonical in Reformed orthodoxy; informs **Calvin, Beza, Ursinus**, and later **Turretin**, and is echoed in **Westminster** on Christology and the Supper. 
 - A key polemical source in Reformed-Lutheran debates and in Anglican-Reformed sacramental synthesis.

- **Enduring value:** 
 - Model of patristically rooted Christology underwriting sacramental theology and church order. 
 - Teachable clarity for linking **person of Christ**, **means of grace**, and **ecclesial discipline**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic union:** One person, two complete natures; no confusion or division. 
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** 
 - **Genus idiomaticum:** Predication of properties of either nature to the person. 
 - **Genus apotelesmaticum:** Unified operations of the person through both natures. 
 - **Genus maiestaticum:** Denied; no transfusion of divine attributes into the human nature. 
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** The Logos is never enclosed by the flesh; divine operations extend beyond the assumed humanity. 
- **Ubiquity of Christ's body:** Rejected; the human nature remains finite and local. 
- **Right hand of God:** Royal dignity and authority, not spatial omnipresence of the body. 
- **Finitum non capax infiniti:** Finite nature cannot contain or become the infinite; safeguards real humanity. 
- **Spiritual presence:** Real communion with Christ by the Spirit, not bodily location in the elements. 
- **Signs and seals:** Sacraments signify and seal grace instrumentally; efficacy tied to Christ and the Spirit, not to the elements as such. 
- **Worthy reception:** Faith receives benefit; unbelief receives judgment, grounding **fencing and admission**. 
- **Marks of the church:** Pure Word, right sacraments, discipline under the ascended Head; ecclesiology flows from session. 
- **Infant baptism and efficacy:** Sign legitimately applied to covenant children; efficacy depends on God's timing and Spirit, not on immediate reception or adult profession.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a Christological foundation for the **Lord's Supper**: denies ubiquity; affirms spiritual feeding and pastoral fencing. 
 - As a conceptual anchor for **sacraments as means of grace**: efficacy mediated by the ascended Christ through the Spirit. 
 - As indirect support in **baptismal debates**: distinguishes sign from thing signified, clarifying mode and efficacy questions. 
 - As a resource in **Reformation ecclesiology**: Christ's session orders ministry, discipline, and admission to the table.
