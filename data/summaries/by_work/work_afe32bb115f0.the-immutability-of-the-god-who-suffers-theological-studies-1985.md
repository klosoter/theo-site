### TITLE
**The Immutability of the God Who Suffers** (Theological Studies, 1985) - Thomas Weinandy

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Mid-1980s Catholic theological conversation reacting to resurgence of concerns about divine passibility: engagement with J. Moltmann's "The Crucified God," process theology (Whitehead/Hartshorne), and pastoral/Christological pressures to affirm a God who truly suffers with humanity. Weinandy writes from a classical-theist, Thomistic-analytic standpoint in a patristic/Aquinian frame.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 Defend the classical attributes of **simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility** while accounting for genuine divine suffering in the economy of salvation (especially in Christ). The task: show that God can be truly said to "suffer" without surrendering divine immutability.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):** 
 - Exposit classical theistic doctrines (simplicity, aseity) and the metaphysical grounds for immutability and impassibility. 
 - Critique contemporary theologies that equate divine suffering with ontological change (process, Moltmann). Argues they conflate relational change with essential mutation. 
 - Develop a Christological solution: the **Word assumes a passible human nature**; suffering belongs to that assumed nature and is thus truly divine insofar as the person of the Son suffers, without the divine nature undergoing change. 
 - Employs Thomistic distinctions (nature/person, operations of the divine and human natures, communicatio idiomatum) to reconcile personal suffering and divine immutability.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Positive interlocutors: Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, classical theists. 
 - Critical interlocutors: Jürgen Moltmann, process theologians (Whitehead/Hartshorne), and modern critics of impassibility. Also engages scriptural materials on Christ's passion and suffering-language about God.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Trinity, Christology (incarnation, communicatio idiomatum), divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), revelation and the economic/immanent Trinity distinction.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 God truly suffers in the person of the incarnate Son, but this personal suffering does not entail ontological change in the divine nature; classical theism's core attributes remain intact when rightly related to Trinitarian Christology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Clear articulation that **personal suffering (in the Son) and ontological immutability (of the divine nature)** are logically compatible. 
 - Emphasis on the *incommunicability of divine essential properties* alongside a robust communicatio idiomatum applied to personhood.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on Moltmann and process theology by diagnosing their move as a category mistake: treating relational/temporal predications as evidence for divine ontological mutability. 
 - Corrects pietistic or overly anthropomorphic depictions of God by insisting on metaphysical precision and Trinitarian nuance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Nuanced use of relational language: distinguishes **relational responsiveness** (God relates without undergoing ontic alteration) from **ontological passibility** (actual change in divine being). 
 - Tight coupling of Thomistic metaphysics with contemporary theological dilemmas about pathos.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Well received among classical-theist Catholic and many conservative Protestant theologians as a firm restatement of traditional commitments. 
 - Criticized by liberation, Moltmannian, and process theologians for downplaying the existential and pastoral importance of divine suffering as ontologically transformative.
- **Enduring value:** 
 - Useful corrective to theological tendencies that collapse person/nature distinctions; indispensable for teaching how Christ's suffering can be affirmed without abandoning classical attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Simplicity:** God has no metaphysical parts; used to ground immutability and resist talk of change in God's essence. 
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; supports claims that God is not contingently altered by external events. 
- **Immutability:** God does not undergo intrinsic change; Weinandy defends this as compatible with divine pathos when properly located in the incarnate person. 
- **Impassibility:** Classical claim that God does not suffer in his divine nature; maintained while allowing personal suffering in the Son. 
- **Divine suffering (pathos):** Affirmed as real but specified as belonging to the assumed human nature and the person of the Son, not the divine nature per se. 
- **Person/nature distinction:** Central explanatory tool to reconcile suffering with immutability-persons may assume passible natures without changing their own substance. 
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Christological principle invoked to explain how properties of human suffering are truly predicated of the person of the Son. 
- **Relational responsiveness vs ontological change:** Key analytical distinction; God can respond relationally without ontic alteration. 
- **Economic vs immanent Trinity:** Deployed to show how economic suffering does not directly imply immanent divine mutability. 
- **Anthropopathy:** Caution against uncritical projection of human emotions into divine being; Weinandy insists on careful analogical language. 
- **Inseparable operations of the Trinity:** Used to show unity of action without collapse of persons or natures.
- **Passibility (theological sense):** The capacity to be affected; Weinandy restricts this to the assumed human nature in Christ.
- **Patristic/Thomistic retrieval:** Methodological stance-uses classical sources to reframe modern debates.

How this work is used across loci: 
- As a **definitional source** for clarifying classical theist positions on immutability and impassibility. 
- As a **polemic** against process theology and Moltmannian theologies that posit divine ontological change. 
- As a **Christological-exegetical model** showing how to predicate suffering of God via the person of the Son without collapsing divine attributes.
