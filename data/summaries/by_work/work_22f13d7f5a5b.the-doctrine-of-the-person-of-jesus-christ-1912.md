### TITLE
The Doctrine of the Person of Jesus Christ (H. R. Mackintosh, 1912)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Scottish theology (New College, Edinburgh). Mackintosh writes amid debates between nineteenth-century German kenotic schools, Ritschlian ethical theology, and conservative Chalcedonian defenders. The work aims to bring rigorous historical and theological method to Christology for a modern readership.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend a coherent doctrine of the person of Christ that preserves **both** the full divinity and genuine humanity of Jesus while explaining how the eternal Son could live, act, and suffer in human history - i.e., to account for the **mode** of the Incarnation without reducing deity or dissolving personhood.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern criticism and various kenotic proposals press the need to explain how divine attributes relate to the human life of Jesus.
 - Exegetical base: close attention to New Testament testimony (especially Philippians 2, the Synoptics, Johannine Christology) and the witness of the Fathers.
 - Theological move: rejects any theory that implies permanent loss or annihilation of divine being; instead proposes **self-limitation** (a non-metaphysical, relational restraint in the exercise of divine attributes) as the proper way to understand kenosis.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: upholds the **hypostatic union** (one person, two natures) and reads Chalcedonian formulations through the categories of personal continuity and the conditional exercise of attributes in incarnation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages the New Testament, patristic tradition, and modern debates - especially the 19th-century kenoticists (e.g., Thomasius and the German school) and their critics. Also in dialogue with Ritschlian emphasis on the ethical and historical dimensions of Christ.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (person and natures), Trinity (occasional concern over how the Son acts), incarnation, kenosis/self-limitation, atonement (as related to the person), divine attributes and impassibility, revelation and consciousness of Christ.
- **Closing line**
 - Mackintosh centers Christology on the personal, historical self-manifestation of the Son: true deity maintained, genuine humanity enacted by a divine **self-limitation** that secures both Chalcedonian orthodoxy and intelligibility for modern thought.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Personalist and ethical reading** of the Incarnation: the Son's entry into humanity is first a personal, volitional self-limitation enabling moral action and suffering, not a metaphysical subtraction of attributes.
 - Stress on the **relational exercise** of divine attributes - attributes can be real but their exercise may be conditionally restrained in the incarnate life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters radical kenoticism that postulates loss of deity; also corrects rigid classical formulations that make divine impassibility into an obstacle to genuine incarnation and suffering.
 - Moves beyond purely speculative metaphysics toward a historical-theological method that privileges biblical witness and pastoral intelligibility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Favors language of **"self-limitation"** or "functional kenosis" over metaphysical "emptying" as literal attribute-loss.
 - Reframes kenosis as compatible with hypostatic unity: the Son remains the same divine person who, by volition, refrains from the autonomous exercise of some divine powers.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded as a temperate mediating resource in Anglican and Reformed circles wrestling with modern biblical criticism and German thought. Influential in Scottish theological education and in 20th-century efforts to rework classical Christology for modern conscience.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a balanced model for students who want to preserve Chalcedonian commitments while engaging kenotic intuitions; prized for its careful exegetical-theological method and pastoral sensitivity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis**
 - Treated not as literal loss but as **voluntary self-limitation** in the Son's mode of acting in history.
- **Self-limitation**
 - Preferred term highlighting volition and relational restraint, avoiding metaphysical subtraction.
- **Hypostatic union**
 - Reaffirmed as the personal unity of divine and human without confusion; central to Mackintosh's synthesis.
- **Divine attributes**
 - Retained in ontology; their **exercise** may be conditioned in the incarnate mode.
- **Philippians 2 (kenotic hymn)**
 - Primary exegetical locus; read as paradigmatic for the Son's kenotic obedience rather than as metaphysical depreciation.
- **Chalcedonian formula**
 - Interpreted through the lens of personal continuity and conditional attribute exercise.
- **Impassibility / passibility**
 - Re-examined to allow genuine suffering of the incarnate Son without denying divine life.
- **Consciousness of Christ**
 - Emphasized as evidence of real human subjectivity within the divine person.
- **Historical-theological method**
 - Preference for biblical and patristic witness over abstract metaphysical speculation.
- **Ritschlian ethical influence**
 - Acknowledged as shaping the focus on moral and religious significance of the Incarnation.
- **Functional kenosis vs. classical kenoticism**
 - Functional: exercise-limitation (Mackintosh's move). Classical: attribute loss (rejected).
- **Personhood**
 - Theological center: the enduring personal identity of the Son who acts in history.
- **Atonement (relation)**
 - Understood in relation to the incarnate obedience and suffering of the one person of the Son.
- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for mediating/functional kenotic positions in Christology.
 - As a **polemic** against both radical kenotic reductionism and lifeless classical abstractions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Philippians 2 and other Christological texts with balance between deity and humanity.
