### TITLE
The Last Things: Hope for This World and the Next - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th century Dutch Reformed theology; Bavinck writes from the Neo-Calvinist/Reformed dogmatic tradition that aims to systematize historic Reformed doctrine in dialog with modern biblical scholarship, philosophical trends, and pastoral need.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Eschatology must be both biblically grounded and systematically integrated: the final things (Christ's return, resurrection, judgment, and the new creation) unify personal salvation and cosmic restoration, offering hope rooted in Christ's person and work.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical survey of New Testament eschatological data (Parousia, resurrection, judgment).
 - Theological synthesis: links Christology (risen Christ as firstfruits) and covenant to individual and cosmic destiny.
 - Systematic implications: intermediate state, nature of resurrection bodies, character of final judgment, eternity (heaven/hell), and the new heavens and new earth.
 - Pastoral and polemical application: counters speculative futurism, universalism, and purely immanent-progress views of history.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with Augustine and Calvin as foundational Reformed interpreters; critiques of modern theological currents (liberal optimism, speculative premillennialism); engages patristic, scholastic, and biblical-critical literatures.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (scriptural authority for eschatology), Christology (risen Christ as eschatological center), Trinity (eschatological roles of Father, Son, Spirit), Covenant (continuity between now and the consummation), Resurrection, Judgment, Creation and providence as they bear on final states.
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers eschatology on the risen and returning Christ, insisting that personal salvation and cosmic renewal are inseparable aspects of God's consummating act.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal-cosmic framing: eschatology is not merely future individual destiny but the restoration and transformation of creation under Christ's reign.
 - Careful balance of "already" and "not yet": real inaugurated blessings (resurrection in Christ) that await consummation (new heavens and earth).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects both crude premillennial literalism and optimistic postmillennial triumphalism; also opposes theological liberalism that reduces eschatology to ethical progress or mere immortality of the soul.
 - Pushes back on any tendency to spiritualize away bodily resurrection or to separate salvation from creation's fate.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses the term **eschatological realism** (implicit) to describe the concrete, bodily, and cosmic character of final hope - not disembodied immortality nor mere symbolic renewal.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in 20th/21st-century Reformed scholarship and teaching; used by neo-Calvinist and conservative Reformed theologians as a primary resource for orthodox, biblically-centered eschatology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to hold biblical exegesis, systematic coherence, and pastoral hope together; remains a corrective to both speculative futurism and reductionist liberalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Parousia (Second Coming)** - central, certain event that grounds resurrection and judgment.
- **Resurrection of the body** - bodily continuity and transformation, not mere resuscitation or purely spiritual afterlife.
- **Final Judgment** - universal, public act of divine justice; decisively links guilt/merit to eternal states (see usage under Final Judgment And Eternal States).
- **Intermediate state** - conscious existence of souls between death and resurrection; real blessedness or suffering prior to final consummation.
- **New heavens and new earth** - transformed creation, continuity with present creation, not annihilation.
- **Kingdom already / not yet** - inaugurated reign of Christ that awaits visible, cosmic consummation.
- **Eternal states (heaven/hell)** - qualitatively distinct, everlasting destinies rooted in relation to Christ; Bavinck rejects universalism.
- **Cosmic eschatology** - restoration of creation's teleology; human salvation is the hinge that reorients the cosmos (see usage under Individual And Cosmic Eschatology).
- **Judgment and election** - Bavinck balances divine sovereignty and human responsibility in final accounting; election secures final redemption for the people of God, judgment vindicates God's righteousness.
- **Eschatological hope** - pastoral category: motivates ethics, worship, and mission; hope is concrete and objective, centered on Christ's acts.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and teaching text for Reformed positions on resurrection, judgment, and the new creation (Final Judgment And Eternal States).
- As an **exegetical-model and conceptual pivot** linking individual soteriology with cosmic redemption - used in studies on Individual And Cosmic Eschatology to demonstrate covenantal continuity and inaugurated-consummated theology.
