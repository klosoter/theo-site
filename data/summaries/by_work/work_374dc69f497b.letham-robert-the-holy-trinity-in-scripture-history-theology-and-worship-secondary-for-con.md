### TITLE
The Holy Trinity: In Scripture, History, Theology, and Worship - Robert Letham (with confessional orientation to the Three Forms of Unity)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed scholarship (early 21st century; Letham published widely on Trinity and Christology).
 - Written for pastors, students, and confessional Reformed contexts; interacts with patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern debates.
 - Three Forms of Unity cited as confessional mileposts to show continuity with Reformed orthodoxy.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The doctrine of the Trinity must be recovered as the foundational, coherent, and worship-shaping Christian doctrine: rooted in Scripture, clarified by church history, defended against modern distortions, and formative for worship and life.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical base: careful Scripture exposition of key Trinitarian texts and motifs.
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic formulations (Athanasius, Cappadocians, Augustine), medieval and Reformational developments, Reformed confessions (including Three Forms of Unity).
 - Systematic synthesis: distinctions between immanent and economic Trinity; persons and essence; relations of origin and properties.
 - Practical application: implications for worship, prayer, soteriology, and ecclesial life.
 - Recurring methodological move: Scripture governs doctrine; history clarifies; theology orders worship.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic authorities (Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nyssa), Augustine, Aquinas; Reformers (Calvin, Zwingli); Reformed confessions (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort/Three Forms of Unity); contemporary critics (social trinitarians, modalists, modern theologians).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), revelation, Christology, pneumatology, attributes of God, perichoresis, soteriology, worship and doxology, ecclesiology; interplay of doctrine and devotion.

- **Closing line**
 - Letham locates the Trinitarian doctrine as the doctrinal hinge: a biblical, historically informed, and confessional account that secures orthodox worship, avoids modern distortions, and sustains Reformed theological identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence on the coherence of **absolute** and **relative** attributes: absolute attributes (simplicity, immutability, omnipotence) belong to the divine essence; relative attributes (paternity, filiation, procession) belong to the persons and are relational, not additive to essence.
 - Balanced treatment of **immanent** (internal) and **economic** (revealed) Trinity-avoids collapsing one into the other while showing their necessary correlation for doctrine and worship.
 - Strong confessional framing: reads Trinitarian doctrine through the prism of the Three Forms of Unity to show continuity with Reformed orthodoxy.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Critiques social trinitarian proposals that risk treating the persons as quasi-autonomous centers of consciousness or as ontologically plural.
 - Opposes modalism by affirming real personhood distinctions grounded in relations of origin.
 - Challenges reductionist modern accounts that prioritize ethical or relational aspects while neglecting classical metaphysical categories.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and popularizes careful use of "relative attributes" in contemporary Reformed discourse, insisting they are relational indices within the simple divine being.
 - Promotes an integrated framework linking historical dogma, biblical exegesis, and liturgical life rather than isolating doctrine as purely speculative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and among confessional Protestants as a modern, readable standard on the Trinity.
 - Frequently cited in discussions that seek to defend classical Trinitarian orthodoxy against modern revisionisms.

- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches a disciplined method: Scripture primacy, historical fidelity, systematic clarity, pastoral application-making it durable for teaching, preaching, and polemical use.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes**
 - Properties of the divine essence common to God as one (simplicity, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience).
 - Letham stresses these are not partitionable among persons.

- **Relative attributes**
 - Relations among persons (paternity, filiation, procession); indicate personhood without dividing essence.
 - Treated as real relational properties that do not constitute separate divine beings.

- **Ousia / Essence**
 - The one divine substance or being shared by the three persons.

- **Hypostasis / Person**
 - The three distinct centers of personal identity (Father, Son, Spirit) sharing one ousia.

- **Immanent Trinity**
 - God as God in himself (internal relations and life of the Godhead).

- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as God for us (the roles and works of Father, Son, Spirit in creation, redemption, sanctification).

- **Relations of origin**
 - The source-related relations (begetting, begotten, procession) that differentiate persons without composition.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling/interpenetration of the persons; used to describe perfect unity-in-distinction.

- **Monarchy of the Father**
 - The Father as the single principle (archē) in the relations of origin; affirmed to secure order without subordinationism.

- **Appropriation**
 - The practice of ascribing certain works more typically to one person (e.g., redemption to the Son) while maintaining inseparable operations.

- **Inseparable operations**
 - Doctrine that external acts of God are the act of the triune God, not of one person alone in isolation.

- **Three Forms of Unity**
 - Confessional texts used to show Letham's continuity with Reformed doctrinal commitments on Trinity and Christ.

- **Social trinitarianism / Modalism**
 - Contemporary alternatives critiqued in the book; Letham uses classical categories to rebut both.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed understanding of persons and attributes (esp. absolute vs relative).
- As a **polemic** against social trinitarian and modalist reinterpretations.
- As an **exegetical-model** linking biblical texts to historical doctrine and liturgical practice.
