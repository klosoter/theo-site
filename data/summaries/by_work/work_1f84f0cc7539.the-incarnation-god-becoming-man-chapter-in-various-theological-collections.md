### TITLE
"The Incarnation: God Becoming Man" - Donald Macleod (chapter in various theological collections). 
Focus: relation of the Son's eternal generation to the historic incarnation; defense of classical Christology (hypostatic union, Chalcedonian language) against kenotic and reductionist accounts.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed evangelical scholarship; Macleod writes as a conservative systematic theologian addressing both academic theology and church confession.
 - Interaction with modern Christological debates (kenoticism, Barthian emphases, historical-critical challenges) and with patristic/creedal heritage (Athanasius, Chalcedon).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The incarnation must be understood as a real, personal assumption of human nature by the eternally begotten Son without change to the divine nature; eternal Sonship provides the only orthodox account of how God becomes man while remaining God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of biblical data for pre-existence and eternal Sonship (notably John, Hebrews, Philippians).
 - Historical-theological defense of eternal generation and Chalcedonian hypostatic union.
 - Critique of kenotic and other theories that propose ontological diminution or alteration in the divine nature.
 - Clarification of economic vs. immanent Trinity: incarnation is an economic act of the Son rooted in intra-Trinitarian relations.
 - Practical/doctrinal implications for revelation, atonement, and Christian worship.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic authorities (Athanasius, the Cappadocians), Chalcedon, Augustine, Reformed scholastic sources.
 - Modern interlocutors: proponents of kenotic Christology, some readings of Barth and those emphasizing functional or temporal "Sonship."
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (eternal generation, economic/immanent distinction), Christology (hypostatic union, two natures, one person), revelation (God's self-disclosure in the incarnate Son), atonement (personal identity of redeemer), communicatio idiomatum, Christ's wills (implicit defense of dyothelitism).
- **Closing line**
 - The incarnation is best confessed as the eternal Son's personal assumption of human nature: God truly becomes man without loss or change in the divine being, thereby securing both objective atonement and reliable divine self-revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, explicit linking of **eternal Sonship** to the incarnation: Sonship is not an economic role bestowed at Bethlehem but an eternal relational property that grounds the incarnational act.
 - Stress on continuity of personhood: the pre-incarnate Son = the incarnate Jesus in identity and agency.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Clear rebuttal of kenotic models that posit divesting of divine attributes; Macleod insists on self-limitation (voluntary non-use) rather than ontological loss.
 - Counters readings that make Sonship merely functional or temporal (some Barthian interpreters), reasserting classical metaphysical categories where helpful.
- **Conceptual / terminological clarity**
 - Distinguishes carefully between **kenosis** as scriptural motif (Phil 2) and systematic kenoticism as ontological theory; prefers language of voluntary condescension and appropriation.
 - Reiterates Chalcedonian formula as the controlling Christological grammar for contemporary debates.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed seminaries for accessible defense of orthodox Christology; used in pastoral and academic settings as a corrective to popularized "loss of deity" theories.
 - Cited by conservative systematic theologians and in courses on Christology as a concise, confessional statement linking Trinity and incarnation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Supplies a compact, theologically disciplined model that preserves both Godward and human aspects of Christ without reducing either - useful for preaching, polemic, and advanced instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Sonship** - The Son's generation from the Father is timeless/eternal and grounds the Son's personal identity prior to and independent of the incarnation.
- **Incarnation** - The Son's personal assumption of human nature; not an ontological conversion of divine being.
- **Hypostatic union** - The one person (hypostasis) of the Son in whom two natures (divine and human) are united without confusion, change, division or separation.
- **Kenosis / kenoticism** - Scriptural motif (Philippians 2) versus systematic theory; Macleod accepts motif but rejects ontological kenoticism (divestiture of divine attributes).
- **Voluntary self-limitation** - The preferred description of how the Son "empties" himself: renunciation of the exercise, not the possession, of divine attributes.
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - The theological principle that properties of both natures are predicable of the one person; used to explain how we speak of Jesus' divine and human attributes.
- **Economic Trinity** - The ordered work of the Father, Son, and Spirit in redemption; incarnation is an economic action rooted in intra-Trinitarian relations.
- **Immanent Trinity** - The eternal relations of Father, Son, and Spirit; Macleod stresses continuity between immanent Sonship and economic incarnation.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - The classic Christological standard Macleod deploys as the normative interpretive key.
- **Dyothelitism** - The affirmation of two wills in Christ (divine and human) implicit in Macleod's commitment to full humanity and full deity.
- **Pre-existence** - Biblical affirmation that the Son exists prior to the incarnation; central to establishing identity.
- **Atonement implications** - Only a personal divine agent who is truly human and truly God can effect objective, efficacious redemption.
- **Revelation nexus** - Incarnation as the decisive act in which God discloses his being; the Son is the "image" and "word" of God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for teaching orthodox relations of eternal Sonship to incarnation in systematic theology courses.
- As a **polemic resource** against kenotic and diminutionist accounts of Christ.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Philippians 2, John, Hebrews within confessional Christology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian doctrine to soteriology and the doctrine of revelation.
