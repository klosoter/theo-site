### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 3: Sin and Salvation in Christ** - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th c. Dutch Neo-Calvinism (Kuyperian milieu) engaging post-Reformation scholasticism and modern theology (Kant, Schleiermacher, Ritschl).
 - A catholic, confessional Reformed project retrieving patristic/medieval insights while resisting modern reductionism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Humanity, fallen in Adam, stands under guilt and corruption; salvation is accomplished by the incarnate Mediator, Jesus Christ, within the Trinitys covenantal counsel, and is grounded in His person and work (states and offices).
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Hamartiology:** nature of sin as ethical privation yet real power; original sin (guilt and pollution); propagation of sin; total depravity without destruction of the imago.
 - **Covenant framework:** covenant of works (pre-fall) with eschatological promise; covenant of grace grounded in the pactum salutis; federal-organic solidarity in Adam and Christ.
 - **Christology (person):** true God and true man; virgin conception; anhypostasia/enhypostasia; communicatio idiomatum (properly understood); extra Calvinisticum; rejection of Lutheran ubiquity.
 - **Christology (work):** threefold office (prophet, priest, king); states of humiliation and exaltation; obedience (active and passive) as one indivisible mediatorial righteousness.
 - **Atonement:** necessity and nature of satisfaction; penal substitution at the core, integrating victory, moral, and governmental aspects; sufficiency for all, efficacy for the elect.
 - **History vs. order of salvation:** distinguishes accomplishment (historia salutis, here) from application (ordo salutis, developed in vol. 4); union with Christ intimated as the hinge.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Patristic: Irenaeus, Athanasius, Augustine.
 - Medieval: Anselm, Aquinas.
 - Reformation/Orthodoxy: Calvin, Ursinus, Turretin, Voetius.
 - Dialogue/critique: Lutherans (genus maiestaticum), Socinians, Remonstrants, Grotius (governmental), Schleiermacher/Ritschl (subjectivism), Kant/Hegel (moralism/speculation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sin and original sin; anthropology (imago Dei damaged yet retained); federal theology (works/grace; pactum salutis); person and work of Christ; satisfaction/atonement; beginnings of pneumatology in Christs anointing.
- **Center of gravity**
 - The triune God, in covenantal grace, restores creation through the incarnate Son, the second Adam, whose penal-substitutionary obedience secures reconciliation for His people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Organic motif:** creation, sin, and redemption as organically connected histories; federal headship understood covenantally and organically.
 - **Catholic Reformed synthesis:** receives the whole churchs heritage while sharpening it confessionally.
 - **Trinitarian-covenantal grounding:** pactum salutis as foundation of the covenant of grace; Spirit-Christ relation central to incarnation and mission.
 - **Integrated atonement model:** penal substitution as center that rightly orders Christus Victor, moral influence, and governmental strands.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **Roman Catholic nature-grace dualism** and concupiscence-as-not-sin; insists concupiscence is truly sin and grace restores nature to its telos.
 - Against **Lutheran ubiquity** and an expansive genus maiestaticum; maintains extra Calvinisticum and integrity of both natures.
 - Against **Socinian/modern** denial of satisfaction and reduction of sin to finitude; upholds sin as guilt before the holy God.
 - Nuances **imputation**: rejects both bare legal fiction and mere realism; affirms federal-organic solidarity in Adam and Christ.
- **Conceptual / terminological refinements**
 - Clear deployment of **anhypostasia/enhypostasia**; careful account of communicatio idiomatum; tight distinction between **historia** and **ordo salutis**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - A standard in contemporary Reformed retrieval; widely cited for balanced Christology, covenant theology, and atonement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Pedagogically clear, historically rich, exegetically sensitive; a durable framework for teaching sin and the work of Christ across loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original Sin (guilt and pollution):** inherited liability and corruption from Adam; retains the image structurally, ruins it ethically.
- **Total Depravity:** sin pervades all faculties; not absolute evil nor loss of humanity.
- **Federal Headship:** Adam and Christ as covenant representatives; guilt/righteousness imputed in covenantal-organic unity.
- **Covenant of Works (Life):** pre-fall probation promising eschatological life; Sabbath and tree motifs; death for disobedience.
- **Covenant of Grace:** divine initiative to save in and through Christ, administered historically, grounded in the pactum salutis.
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption):** intra-trinitarian counsel establishing the Mediators mission and the elects salvation.
- **States of Christ:** humiliation (incarnation to burial) and exaltation (resurrection to session/return) structuring His work.
- **Threefold Office:** Christ as prophet, priest, king uniting revelation, reconciliation, and dominion.
- **Active and Passive Obedience:** lifes-long law-keeping and atoning suffering as one mediatorial obedience imputed to believers.
- **Satisfaction / Penal Substitution:** Christ bears curse and wrath, satisfying divine justice; integrates victory and renewal.
 - Sufficiency/efficacy: sufficient for all, efficient for the elect.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** true predication of properties to the person; natures remain distinct without confusion.
- **Extra Calvinisticum:** the Logos remains infinite beyond the assumed humanity; safeguards both natures.
- **Anhypostasia / Enhypostasia:** Christs human nature has no independent hypostasis yet subsists in the Logos.
- **Propagation of Sin:** explains transmission (creationism vs. traducianism) with a cautious preference for an organic account.
- **Common Grace:** restrains sin and sustains culture post-fall; frames the worlds continuity amid redemptive history.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for sin, covenants, and the person/work of Christ.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant theology to Christology and atonement.
 - As a **polemic resource** against denials of satisfaction, historical Adam, or proper two-natures Christology.
 - As an **exegetical-theological model** for integrating atonement motifs under penal substitution.
