### TITLE
Willem van Asselt (ed.), Reformed Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment - focus on Francis Turretin; note on the volume's use for debates about **Open Theism** and **Divine Condescension**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 16th-18th century Reformed Scholasticism as practiced in Geneva, Saumur, and the Dutch universities; Francis Turretin (1623-1687) as a representative late scholastic Reformed theologian.
 - Van Asselt's volume (modern historiographical reassessment) seeks to recover method and nuance of scholastic theology for contemporary theology and historiography.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Turretin and the scholastics aim to preserve a tight coherence between God's **absolute sovereignty, immutability, and exhaustive foreknowledge** and his **gracious condescension** toward creatures - a locus frequently pressed by modern critics and by Open Theists.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: scholastic loci, distinction-theory, minute conceptual refinement, systematic use of Scripture plus patristic and medieval authorities.
 - Major moves typical of Turretin:
 - Define God's simple, immutable nature; show how attributes (knowledge, will, power) are identical with essence yet distinguished conceptually.
 - Distinguish types of decrees (absolute / decretum commune vs. conditional), foreknowledge vs. prescience of future contingent acts.
 - Articulate **concurrence**: God as efficient cause cooperating with secondary causes without absorbing creaturely agency.
 - Explain **condescension** (condescensio/accommodatio): God condescends in revelation and providential action without undergoing change or passibility.
 - Polemic: refute Arminian/Modern innovations (e.g., Open Theism, Molinism) that, in Turretin's view, compromise divine immutability or sovereignty.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Calvin and Calvinian tradition, Voetians, Gomarus; opposes Arminians, some Cartesianizing tendencies, and later open-theist sympathies.
 - Uses Scripture, Augustine, scholastic manuals (Aquinas, medieval distinctions), contemporary polemical literature.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology proper (divine attributes, simplicity, immutability), providence, predestination/decrees, foreknowledge, concurrence, revelation (accommodation/condescension), and implications for Christology and soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin exemplifies a disciplined Reformed scholastic effort to hold God's transcendent immutability and exhaustive knowledge together with a biblical doctrine of gracious condescension and creaturely freedom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations**
 - Precision in distinguishing conceptual categories (essence/attributes; decree/permission; antecedent/consequent will).
 - Robust doctrine of **concurrence** that secures divine causation without annihilating secondary causality.
 - Framing of condescension as **incommunicable accommodation**: real relational condescension that does not imply ontological change in God.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects crude dichotomies that set divine immutability against genuine interaction; refutes open-theist claims by denying that openness to the future is required for genuine relationality.
 - Opposes Molinist constructs (middle knowledge) as unnecessary and incoherent with Reformed doctrine of decretive will.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of scholastic distinctions to articulate degrees of divine intention (e.g., simple antecendentia of decrees vs. the contingent prescience of temporal acts).
 - Terminological sharpening of "accommodation" to defend revelation as true condescension.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Rediscovered in recent scholarship (via van Asselt and others) as resource for biblical theology, apologetics, and doctrinal clarification.
 - Influential among conservative Reformed theologians resisting Open Theism; used in seminaries to teach classical theism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a portable methodological toolbox: rigorous distinctions, exegetical proof-structure, and a coherent theism that remains operational for contemporary doctrinal and polemical contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed Scholasticism** - method combining Reformed confessional theology with scholastic conceptual rigor and locus-based organization.
- **Francis Turretin** - exemplar of late Reformed scholastic method; systematic defense of divine sovereignty, decrees, foreknowledge.
- **Divine Immutability** - God's unchangeableness; central presupposition in arguments against Open Theism.
- **Divine Condescension (condescensio / accommodatio)** - God's self‑communication to finite creatures without ontological change; key to reconciling transcendence and relationality.
- **Foreknowledge / Prescience** - God's eternal knowledge of all future acts; not sequentially acquired, but eternally present.
- **Decrees (absolute vs. conditional)** - distinction preserving God's eternal purpose while explaining secondary causation and contingency.
- **Concurrence (concurrent causality)** - doctrine that God cooperates with secondary causes in their actions, preserving creaturely responsibility.
- **Accommodation** - the manner in which revelation suits finite understandings while remaining truthfully divine.
- **Divine Simplicity** - attributes are not parts but identical with God's essence; used to argue against metaphysical change.
- **Open Theism (contrast)** - theological position positing an open future and dynamic knowledge; Turretinian response insists this undermines divine sovereignty and immutable knowledge.
- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge (contrast)** - alternative attempt to reconcile providence and libertarian freedom; rejected by Turretin as incompatible with Reformed decretalism.
- **Counterfactuals of Freedom** - contested category; Turretin treats such appeals skeptically insofar as they relativize divine decrees.
- **Providence** - divine governance exercised via concurrence and decree; explanatory center for divine action and condescension.
- **Accommodation vs. Passibility** - crucial distinction: God accommodates without becoming passible.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: clarifies classical Reformed terms (immutability, concurrence, accommodation).
 - As a **polemic**: primary resource in arguing against Open Theism and for classical theism.
 - As an **exegetical-model**: exemplifies how Scripture and metaphysical categories are integrated for doctrine of God and providence.
