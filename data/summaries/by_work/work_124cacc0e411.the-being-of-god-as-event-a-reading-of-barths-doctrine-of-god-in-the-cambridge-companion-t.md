### TITLE
**The Being of God as Event: A Reading of Barth's Doctrine of God** - Bruce McCormack (in The Cambridge Companion to Karl Barth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th/early-21st century Barth scholarship; McCormack as leading post-war Barthian interpreter.
 - Responds to debates about Barth's realism, ontotheology, and his relation to modern philosophy (Kant, Hegel).
 - Situated within renewed interest in Trinitarian theology and the analytic/theological interface.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth's doctrine of God should be read as saying **God's very being is event** - not a static metaphysical substance but divine self-giving and revealing (the act-event of God).
 - This reading resolves tensions about how God is both transcendent and known: God is known in the event of revelation (the Word/Christ) without reducing God to creaturely categories.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies Barth's rejection of the analogia entis (analogy of being) and defence of the analogia fidei (analogy of faith).
 - Shows Barth moves from traditional metaphysical ontology to a Trinitarian, relational ontology where *being = act* (actu essentiae as event).
 - Reconstructs Barth's Trinitarian schema: God is known in the Word-event; the economic Trinity reveals the immanent life of God without collapsing them.
 - Argues Barth affirms genuine ontological claims (God is real and objective) while denying a creature-centered appropriation of God (no ontotheological assimilation).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutor: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics, especially Dogmatics I/II on doctrine of God).
 - Philosophical contexts: Kantian critical philosophy, Hegelianism, and modern ontotheology.
 - Theological interlocutors: medieval scholastic analogia entis tradition; contemporary interpreters like Jüngel, Moltmann, Rahner by contrast.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word-event), Trinity (immanent/economic relation), Providence and election (as Trinitarian acts), doctrine of God (ontology vs. event), Christology (Christ as decisive divine event), doctrine of language about God.

- **Closing line**
 - Barth's God is not primarily a being to be inferred by creaturely reason but **the living event of divine self‑disclosure (the Word-Event)** - a Trinitarian, relational ontology that preserves transcendence without emptying knowledge of God.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reads Barth as offering a true ontology: **being as event**, not mere epistemological stance or fideism.
 - Emphasizes Trinitarian relationality as constitutive of divine being (the divine "what" is the divine "who" in action).

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that cast Barth as purely anti-metaphysical or fideistic; McCormack argues Barth affirms a substantive (though non-ontotheological) doctrine of God.
 - Contrasts Barth with analogia entis proponents: rejects creature-centered analogy that grounds talk of God in participatory metaphysics.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reclaims classical terms (being, essence) but recasts them through the category of *event* and *act* (actus trinitatis).
 - Deploys "being-as-event" as a pivot that keeps ontological seriousness while repudiating ontotheology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Barth studies: shaped subsequent work that treats Barth as a constructive ontologist.
 - Stimulated renewed dialogue between analytic philosophy of religion and continental theological exegesis of Barth.
 - Provoked debate: some defenders of analogia entis and metaphysical realism press back; others adopt McCormack's approach for constructive dogmatics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how Barth can be both critically modern and sharply theological; provides a usable framework for Reformed Trinitarian theologies.
 - Useful pedagogically for showing how revelation, Trinity, and ontology interrelate in systematic theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being as event**
 - Central McCormack locution: divine being = self‑communicative event (not static substance).

- **Analogia entis**
 - The traditional analogy of being; critiqued by Barth and treated by McCormack as metaphysical route that compromises divine otherness.

- **Analogia fidei**
 - The analogy of faith; Barth's preferred basis for theological predication - scripture-shaped, event-centered, and affirmed by McCormack as epistemically prior.

- **Actus (act) / actus trinitatis**
 - God's being understood as act; Trinitarian mutuality and economic revelation are constitutive acts.

- **Revelation / Word-event**
 - Revelation is an event (the Word/Christ) in which God's being is made present and known.

- **Immanent vs economic Trinity**
 - McCormack stresses Barth's careful move to infer immanent reality from economic revelation - without collapsing distinction or reducing immanent life to creaturely categories.

- **Ontotheology**
 - The tendency to make God a being among beings; Barth rejects this, McCormack argues Barth replaces it with non-reductive ontological claim.

- **Transcendence and disclosure**
 - Maintains divine transcendence while insisting disclosure (event) is the proper medium of knowledge.

- **Christ-event / election**
 - Christ as decisive divine event; election as an eternal act manifest in the historical event of Christ.

- **Predication about God**
 - Theological language is event-grounded: predicates trace back to the Word-event, not to analogical metaphysics.

- **Creature/Creator distinction**
 - Preserved through rejection of analogia entis but affirmed as meaningful ontological difference even within event-ontology.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: to define a post-ontotheological but ontologically serious doctrine of God.
 - Polemic: as a corrective against claims that Barth is anti-realist or merely epistemic; used against analogia entis approaches.
 - Exegetical model / conceptual pivot: as a template for Trinitarian dogmatics that integrates revelation, Christology, and ontology.
