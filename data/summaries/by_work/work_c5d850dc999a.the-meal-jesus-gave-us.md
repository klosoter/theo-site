### TITLE
The Meal Jesus Gave Us - N. T. Wright

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Contemporary Anglican scholarship (late 20th-early 21st century). Emerges from Wright's larger programme of New Testament narrative theology: historical-literary reading of Jesus within first-century Judaism, combined with a pastoral focus on ecclesial practice and sacramental life.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The Lord's Supper is the covenantal, eschatological meal instituted by Jesus that both memorializes and enacts his death and resurrection, constituting the church as a foretaste of the kingdom. It should be read in its Jewish Passover/meal context and understood as communal participation in Christ rather than reducible to either purely symbolic memorialism or metaphysical transubstantiation.

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Historical-linguistic foundation: situates the Last Supper in Passover/meal traditions and reads New Testament phrases (e.g., "in Christ", "participation in the body/blood") within that matrix. 
 - Theological synthesis: argues for a sacramental realism shaped by eschatology - the meal is a present gift of the risen Lord mediated by the Spirit and instituted words, pointing forward to consummation. 
 - Ecclesial and pastoral implications: the supper constructs and sustains corporate identity, reconciliation, and mission; it is a public enactment of covenant, not a private symbol. 
 - Polemical corrections: critiques both reductionist memorialism and scholastic metaphysical accounts that lose the meal's narrative and covenantal dynamics.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages New Testament texts (Eucharistic traditions in Gospels and Paul, especially 1 Corinthians 11). 
 - Dialogues implicitly with historical positions: Zwingli (memorialist), Luther and medieval sacramental theologies (real presence/transubstantiation), Calvin (spiritual real presence), patristic imagery, and contemporary sacramental theologians. 
 - Uses Jewish Passover/meal scholarship and Second Temple background to reframe exegetical assumptions.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Sacramental theology, Christology (presence of the risen Lord), ecclesiology (church as covenant community), covenant theology (new covenant), eschatology (already/not-yet), pneumatology (Spirit's mediatory role), soteriology (participation in Christ's death/resurrection).

- **Closing line:** 
 The Lord's Supper is a covenantal, communal enactment of the death-resurrection of Jesus that makes the risen Lord present to and formative of the church as a foretaste of the coming kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong narrative-historical reading: locates the supper within Passover/meal practice rather than abstract sacramental categories. 
 - Eschatological framing: the meal is both present reality and future promise - a foretaste that shapes Christian identity and mission. 
 - Communal/covenantal focus: emphasis on table-fellowship as constitutive of the people of God rather than primarily individualistic nourishment.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on strict memorialism (e.g., Zwinglian reduction) by arguing for a real, Spirit-mediated presence without resorting to medieval metaphysics. 
 - Moves beyond purely symbolic or purely metaphysical accounts by situating presence within participation language and covenant enactment (closer to a Reformed/Calvinist strain but reframed narratively).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Re-centers the term "meal" rather than technical sacramental vocabulary, using "covenant-meal" and "foretaste" as key descriptors. 
 - Emphasizes "participation" (in Christ) as sacramental language grounded in communal narrative.

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in Anglican and evangelical contexts as a biblically grounded, pastorally sensitive account. 
 - Influential among those wanting to bridge scholarship and liturgical practice; less satisfying to those seeking precise metaphysical accounts of presence. 
 - Cited in teaching, preaching, and liturgical renewal conversations.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Clear exemplar of how to integrate exegetical, historical, and pastoral concerns. 
 - Useful corrective to polarized sacramental debates; recovers the meal's communal, covenantal, and eschatological dimensions for contemporary churches.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lord's Supper / Holy Communion / Eucharist:** the meal Jesus gave; central sacramental enactment of the new covenant. 
- **Meal / Covenant-meal:** preferred framing; highlights table-fellowship, covenant enactment, and narrative context. 
- **Passover / Last Supper context:** historical lens that recovers Jewish meal symbolism and explains Jesus' words/actions. 
- **New Covenant:** the theological matrix for understanding blood language and covenant renewal at the meal. 
- **Participation ("in Christ", koinonia with body/blood):** key Pauline trope used to explain sacramental union and communal identity. 
- **Real presence (nuanced):** presence of the risen Lord mediated by Spirit and words of institution; rejects reductionist memorialism and scholastic transubstantiation. 
- **Eschatological foretaste:** the meal as present sign and promise of the kingdom's consummation. 
- **Pneumatology (Spirit's role):** Spirit enables and effects the presence and participation received at the table. 
- **Words of institution:** performative speech that shapes sacramental reality within the gathered community. 
- **Communal/communion ethic:** table unity, reconciliation, and mission flow from the supper. 
- **Sacramental efficacy:** not magical but covenantal and participatory - the meal effects communion with Christ and formation into the church. 
- **Memorialism (contrast):** an account Wright critiques when it reduces the supper to mere remembrance. 
- **Table fellowship:** social and theological term emphasizing hospitality, inclusion, and boundary-shaping of the church. 
- **Kingdom language:** links the supper to Jesus' proclamation of God's reign and the future hope.

- **How this work is used across loci:** 
 - As a **definition source** for understanding Eucharist as a covenantal, eschatological meal. 
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Last Supper traditions in their Jewish/meal context. 
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology and liturgical renewal to recover communal and missional dimensions of communion.
