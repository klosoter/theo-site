### TITLE
At the Origins of Christian Worship (1999) - Larry W. Hurtado

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 1999 amid renewed scholarly debate over the origins and timing of high Christology and early Christian liturgical forms.
 - Moves against models that place Jesus-devotion and divine status late in the second century; draws on epigraphy, inscriptional finds, and textual analysis.
 - Interdisciplinary: combines New Testament studies, Jewish studies, early Christian liturgy, and inscriptional/archaeological evidence.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Early Christian worship shows **devotional patterns that treat Jesus as an object of divine honor and worship alongside YHWH**, indicating that high Christology and the elements of what becomes the doctrine of the Trinity are rooted very early in Christian practice rather than being late conceptual developments.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Documents specific devotional actions (prayer, baptismal formulas, Eucharistic language, hymns, inscriptions) directed to Jesus as well as to God.
 - Argues that **primitive Jewish monotheism** makes such Jesus-devotion theologically significant: early Christians did not lightly assign divine cultic status to a human agent.
 - Major moves:
 - Survey NT and extra-NT texts for evidence of worship and devotion to Jesus (Pauline letters, Gospel material, early hymns).
 - Analyze non-literary evidence (inscriptions, dedicatory formulae) for cultic language addressed to Jesus.
 - Show how liturgical practice shaped and expressed theological reflection - worship as formative of doctrine.
 - Conclude that worship practices anticipate, and provide the social-discursive context for, formal Trinitarian articulation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary sources: Pauline epistles, Gospel sediments (especially Johannine and Pauline traditions), early hymnic passages (e.g., Phil 2:6-11), Didache, Apostolic Fathers, inscriptional evidence from tombs, house churches, and dedicatory texts.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: debates with scholars who submit a late development of high Christology; engages with scholarship on Jewish monotheism, NT Christology, and origins of Christian liturgy.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (origin and content of devotion to Jesus)
 - **Revelation** (how worship reveals theological claims)
 - **Trinity** (implications of early worship for understanding a triune revelation)
 - **Monotheism** (Jewish/early Christian negotiation of divine identity)
 - Worship doctrines (prayer, eucharist, baptism as theological loci)

- **Closing line**
 - Hurtado contends that the **shape of earliest Christian worship itself is primary evidence** that Jesus was treated and experienced as divine in the first generation(s) of the church, supplying the social-practical ground from which trinitarian formulations later emerged.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats **worship practice as normative evidence** for theological status rather than relegating doctrine to later intellectual formulation.
 - Emphasizes the cognitive power of cultic behavior: ritual patterns instantiate and disclose theological claims.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges gradualist/evolutionary reconstructions that place divine Christology in a late, Hellenistic phase; argues for **early, robust Jesus-devotion** detectable in multiple independent data streams.
 - Counters purely propositional histories of doctrine by centering **praxis first**.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses careful language distinguishing **devotion to Jesus** from later formalized doctrinal vocabulary (resists simplistic "proto-Trinity" label while noting binitarian tendencies).
 - Advocates reading liturgy and inscription as theological texts in their own right.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in NT studies, early church history, and liturgical theology; sparked increased attention to inscriptional and archaeological evidence for early cult.
 - Adopted by many as a corrective to theories that minimize early worship of Jesus; generated responses refining chronology and social contexts.

- **Enduring value**
 - Methodological model: integrates material culture with textual exegesis.
 - Pedagogical value: reframes origins-of-doctrine questions around lived worship practices.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Early Jesus-devotion** - the set of practices and dispositions in which Jesus is addressed, prayed to, or venerated.
- **Divine cult** - public liturgical honor meant for deity; Hurtado shows Jesus receives elements of this cult.
- **Monotheism (Jewish context)** - background constraint: Jewish monotheism shapes why Jesus-devotion is theologically striking.
- **Worship-as-evidence** - methodological posture treating ritual acts as primary historical data for belief.
- **High Christology** - attribution of divine status/function to Jesus in earliest communities.
- **Binitarian tendencies** - Hurtado's neutral descriptor for early practice of addressing God and Jesus together without full trinitarian systematization.
- **Liturgical formation** - the claim that ritual practice shapes belief and doctrinal expression.
- **Inscriptions and dedications** - non-literary sources used to corroborate literary testimony to Jesus-devotion.
- **Hymnic material** - embedded early confessions (e.g., Philippians 2) that reflect and shape worship.
- **Eucharistic and baptismal formulas** - loci where honor due to God is extended to Jesus.
- **Praxis-first hermeneutic** - analytical stance that praxis can precede and precipitate doctrine.
- **Revelation of the Trinity (implicative use)** - Hurtado: worship practices are a form of revelation that anticipates trinitarian articulation without equating practice with later dogmatic formulations.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how liturgical data illumine New Testament theology.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against accounts that postpone high Christology to late development.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in studies of revelation and Trinity: showing ritual revelation as formative for doctrinal development.
