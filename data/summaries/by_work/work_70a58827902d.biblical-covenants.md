### TITLE
Biblical Covenants - Peter J. Gentry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical-Reformed biblical-theological renewal. Positioned within the canonical and redemptive-historical movements that react against both classical dispensationalism and abstracted systematic reductions of covenant theology.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 The biblical covenants provide the organizing structure of Scripture: they articulate God's unfolding purpose (promise + obligation) and culminate in Christ who fulfills and transforms covenantal promises into the inaugurated New Covenant kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Identify major covenantal administrations (Adamic, Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant) as stages in a single covenantal economy. 
 - Analyze each covenant according to a consistent schema: parties, stipulations (promises/requirements), signs/ratification, blessings/curses, and eschatological scope. 
 - Read the Old and New Testaments canonically to show continuity (single covenantal plan) and discontinuity (different administrations and mediatorial roles). 
 - Argue that Christ is the climactic covenant mediator whose person and work both fulfills prior promises (seed, land, kingship) and inaugurates the definitive eschatological order (kingdom/new covenant).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages classical covenant theologians (Vos, Murray), canonical critics (Brevard Childs), redemptive-historical proponents, and opponents from dispensationalism and minimal-covenant reductions. 
 - Interacts with ANE treaty and suzerainty-vassal models for understanding covenant form and function.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 Revelation, covenant (structure and history), Christology (mediatorial role), soteriology (promise-fulfillment), ecclesiology (church as covenant people), eschatology (kingdom consummation), law and typology, sacramental signs (circumcision, Passover, Sabbath).
- **Closing line:** 
 The theological center: Scripture is the story of God's faithful covenantal dealings, progressively revealed and consummated in Christ, so covenant is the indispensable lens for coherent biblical theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong canonical/grammatical-historical reading that keeps the covenants embedded in redemptive history rather than reducing them to abstract systems. 
 - Emphasis on the covenant as promise-driven rather than merely legal contract: promise precedes and shapes obligation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back on dispensational compartmentalization by demonstrating intrinsic continuity across administrations. 
 - Critiques overly schematic covenant systems that collapse distinct administrations into a single timeless covenant without honoring historical administrations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Reasserts a consistent analytic schema for comparing covenants across Scripture (parties / stipulations / signs / sanctions / scope). 
 - Reinforces a mediatorial christocentric reading that treats covenant offices (king, priest, prophet) as fulfilled uniquely in Christ.
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in evangelical Reformed seminaries and by pastors seeking redemptive-historical homiletics. 
 - Influential in bridging OT covenant studies and NT fulfillment-focused readings; valued by biblical-theology curricula.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a clear, portable framework for teaching how the Bible's storyline coheres around covenantal promise and fulfillment. 
 - Serves as a corrective to atomized proof-texting and to schematic abstractions that lose historical particularity.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (berith):** relational/legal arrangement between God and humans characterized by promise and obligation; central organizing category.
- **Administration / covenantal administration:** distinct historical manifestations or economies of the one covenantal plan (e.g., Mosaic administration).
- **Adamic covenant:** covenantal aspects in Genesis 1-3 (often linked to covenant of works / creation order).
- **Noahic covenant:** universal post-flood covenant; communal/creation-level commitments and promise (rainbow as sign).
- **Abrahamic covenant:** promise of seed, land, and blessing; foundational for election and mission.
- **Mosaic covenant:** covenant of law with stipulations and sanctions; mediates national identity and covenantal obedience.
- **Davidic covenant:** royal promise securing messianic kingship and dynasty; anticipatory of Christ's kingship.
- **New Covenant:** eschatological covenant announced in prophets, enacted in Christ-internalized law, forgiveness, Spirit-mediated life.
- **Promise / obligation schema:** analytic frame distinguishing God-initiated promises and human obligations within each covenant.
- **Sign / ratification:** visible rites (circumcision, Passover, Sabbath) that mark and reaffirm covenant membership and promises.
- **Typology / fulfillment:** patterns in earlier covenants and institutions that find innermost meaning in Christ's person and work.
- **Kingdom:** covenantal rule realized progressively through covenants and consummated in Christ's reign.
- **Mediator / mediatorial office:** office (priest/prophet/king) that represents the people before God; Christ as unique mediator.
- **Federal headship:** the idea that representative figures (Adam, Abraham, Christ) covenantally bind others.
- **Promise motif (land/seed/blessing):** recurrent covenantal promise cluster that shapes Israel's story and messianic expectations.

- **Uses across loci:** 
 - Definition source: provides operative definitions for "covenant" and "administration" used in biblical-theological syllabi. 
 - Polemic: used to argue against dispensational compartmentalization and against reductionist covenant summaries. 
 - Exegetical model: supplies a comparative schema for reading individual covenant texts and tracing fulfillment in the NT. 
 - Conceptual pivot: serves as a hermeneutical center for preaching, systematic formulations (soteriology/eschatology), and ecclesial identity.
