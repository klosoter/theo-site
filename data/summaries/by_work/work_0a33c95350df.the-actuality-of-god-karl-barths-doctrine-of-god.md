### TITLE
The Actuality of God: Karl Barth's Doctrine of God - Bruce L. McCormack (Oxford University Press, 1995)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century reassessment of Barthian dogmatics after decades of reception/resistance; McCormack writes from within Reformed academic context seeking to clarify Barth's dogmatic method and ontology.
 - Reaction against both classical metaphysical theism (analogia entis) and reductive modern theologies; conversation partners include Rahner, Pannenberg, Moltmann, Torrance, and contemporary Thomists.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Barth's doctrine of God must be read as *actualism*: God's being is not a static substance but the **actuality** of God's self-determining, self-revealing act. Revelation (especially in Christ) is constitutive of the being of God.
 - The key doctrinal problem: how to speak of God as truly known in revelation without collapsing the distinction between Creator and creature or reifying God into metaphysical categories.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical and systematic reconstruction of Barth's moves in Church Dogmatics:
 - Diagnose failures of classical metaphysics (analogia entis) and modern subjectivism.
 - Reconstruct Barth's doctrine that the economic revelation is the true access to the immanent Trinity because God's being is actual, not a hidden ontological substrate.
 - Show how Barth's use of *election*, *revelation*, and *encounter* grounds predication of God without recourse to analogical metaphysics.
 - Emphasis on Christ as the locus where God's actuality is disclosed; election and incarnation as the decisive acts wherein God is what God is.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Karl Barth (Church Dogmatics).
 - Interlocutors: Karl Rahner (Rahner's Rule), Thomas Aquinas/analogical tradition, Friedrich Schleiermacher, Hegelian critiques, contemporary systematicians (Pannenberg, Moltmann).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Trinity (economic/immanent), Christology, election, divine freedom and necessity, analogy/analogia entis, divine predication and attributes.

- **Closing line**
 - Barth's doctrine of God, properly read, converts doctrine into a theology of divine **actuality**: God is known and is God in the very act of revealing himself in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - The ontological primacy of divine act over substance: being-as-act (actuality) rather than being-as-property.
 - A strong christocentric epistemology: authentic knowledge of God is identical with encounter with the incarnate Word.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects readings that cast Barth as simply anti-metaphysical or irrationalist; McCormack shows Barth develops a coherent metaphysical claim (actualism) that opposes traditional analogia entis.
 - Contrasts Barth with Rahner's classical formulation (Rahner's Rule) by showing Barth reformulates the economy/immanent relation: not a transference of predicates but the ontological identity of God's being with God's act of revelation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recuperation of the term **actuality** (Aktualitat) as systematic center.
 - Reframing of election and revelation as constitutive categories for ontology rather than merely soteriological.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Reinvigorated Barth studies; influenced later constructive work in Reformed and ecumenical theology, and debates on divine simplicity, freedom, and relational ontology.
 - Provoked renewed engagement with Rahner/Pannenberg and with analytic approaches to doctrine of God.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies Barth's systematic coherence and provides a usable hermeneutic for reading Church Dogmatics.
 - Supplies a robust alternative to static classical theism for contemporary constructive theologians and doctoral students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Actuality (Aktualitat)** - central category: God's being is his act of self-revelation; ontology grounded in divine act.
- **Revelation as constitutive** - revelation (especially in Christ) does not merely reveal pre-existing attributes; it is the event in which God is.
- **Economic Trinity / Immanent Trinity** - Barth's reformulation: what is known in the economy is properly trustworthy for speaking of the immanent God because of divine actualism.
 - Relation to **Rahner's Rule**: Barth rejects simple transference but affirms that economic acts are constitutive of God's being.
- **Election** - the decisive divine act that grounds both being and revelation; central to Barth's ontology.
- **Analogia entis** - rejected/criticized: human metaphysical analogy cannot secure true knowledge of God apart from revelation.
- **Divine freedom and necessity** - God is free in self-determination, yet his acts are necessary insofar as they constitute his actuality.
- **Christocentrism** - Christ as the unique locus of God's actuality and the center of theological predication.
- **Predication of God** - theological language grounded in encounter; predicates apply because God has made himself present in acts.
- **Ontology as relational/evental** - being conceived as relations and events, not static substances.
- **Dogmatic retrieval** - method of reading Barth as offering a systematic ontology rather than merely polemical material.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Barthian actualism and for rethinking ontology in systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against analogia entis and classical metaphysical theism in contemporary doctrinal debates.
 - As an **exegetical model** for close, textually-grounded readings of Church Dogmatics that recover theological coherence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating Trinity, Christology, and revelation into a single ontological framework.
