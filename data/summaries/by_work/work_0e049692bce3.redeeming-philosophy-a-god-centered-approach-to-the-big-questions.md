### TITLE
**Redeeming Philosophy: A God-Centered Approach to the Big Questions - Vern Poythress**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed evangelical context (2000s). Poythress writes from Westminster/Reformed commitments, engaging analytic philosophy, contemporary epistemology, and systematic theology.
 - Reaction against secularizing modern philosophy and to Christian accommodation of autonomous reason; seeks to place Christian theism as constructive first principle.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Philosophy must be "redeemed" by subordinating its methods and questions to a **God-centered first principle**: biblical theism. When God is the ultimate reality and intelligibility, philosophical problems (knowledge, existence, ethics, mind, freedom, universals) are reframed and progressively resolved.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Critique of secular and Christian philosophical options that isolate reason from revelation.
 - Part II: Articulation of a God-centered philosophical method grounded in Scripture and classical theism.
 - Theology as principial and scientific in a disciplined sense: Scripture supplies first principles that make philosophical inquiry coherent and disciplined.
 - Triperspectival and relational emphases: logical (normative), situational (empirical), and existential/personal perspectives integrated under divine first principles.
 - Part III: Application to major topics - knowledge (knowability of God), metaphysics (being, attributes, simplicity, aseity), Trinity (ontological vs economic), providence and freedom (critique of Molinism), and biblical revelation (OT/NT testimony to God's being).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages modern philosophers (analytic epistemology, metaphysics), classical theologians (Augustine, Aquinas), Reformed figures (Calvin, Kuyper), and contemporary debates (Molinists, open theists, secular analytic philosophers).
 - Dialogues with Van Tilian presuppositionalism but develops distinct methodological formulations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (divine attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility)
 - Doctrine of the Trinity (ontological vs economic distinctions; biblical revelation)
 - Bibliology (Scripture as principial ground for philosophy)
 - Providence, freedom, and middle knowledge debated

- **Closing line**
 - Redeeming Philosophy insists that a robust biblical theism supplies the principial, coherent framework needed to do philosophy rightly: God as the explanatory ground both secures intelligibility and restrains conceptual error.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats philosophy as a discipline that must be intentionally *theocentered*: Scripture provides first principles that govern philosophical method.
 - Integrates analytic rigor with biblical realism; insists theology can be principial and scientific without capitulating to secular definitions of science.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Critiques Molinism's reliance on autonomous counterfactuals; offers a sovereignty-grounded alternative to account for foreknowledge and human freedom.
 - Opposes purely naturalistic and autonomy-based Christian philosophies that divorce doctrine from philosophical method.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Strong use of **absolute vs relative attributes** language to clarify how God's immutable essence grounds relational economy.
 - Emphasizes an integrated **ontological/economic Trinity** reading: careful distinctions without fragmentation, locating economic actions within ontological relations.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed academic circles for providing a model of philosophically competent, biblically grounded theology.
 - Influential among those seeking to defend classical attributes while addressing contemporary analytic challenges; less persuasive to Molinists and open-theist proponents.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact toolkit for students who must traverse philosophy-theology interfaces: principial methodology, attribute theology nuance, and applied critiques (knowledge, freedom, Trinity).
 - Useful as a corrective to naturalistic presuppositions in philosophy and as a model for systematic, doctrine-driven philosophical work.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-centered philosophy** - Philosophy whose first principle is the biblical God; theological commitments shape questions and criteria of intelligibility.
- **Principial theology** - Theology that supplies foundational principles (Scripture) for coherent philosophical inquiry; treats theology as disciplined and quasi-scientific.
- **Absolute vs relative attributes** - Distinguishes attributes as essential (absolute) from those that appear in relation to creatures (relative), preventing confusion about change or passibility.
- **Simplicity** - God's noncompositeness; Poythress defends classical simplicity while explaining relational knowledge without metaphysical division.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence; used to ground ontology and the knowability of other things.
- **Immutability / Impassibility** - Poythress preserves these classical attributes but shows how economic relations (love, response) are real without implying change in divine essence.
- **Ontological vs economic Trinity** - Ontological: inner divine life (immanent); Economic: God's actions in history. Poythress insists on tight correlation: economic revelation discloses ontological reality.
- **Knowability of God** - God is fully knowable insofar as He self-reveals; human knowledge is enabled by revelation and common grace but remains creaturely.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism (critique)** - Challenges the grounding of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom apart from God's sovereign decree; argues for a sovereignty-compatible account of foreknowledge.
- **Biblical revelation (OT & NT witness to Trinity)** - Traces typological and canonical motifs in the OT and explicit NT revelation to argue for coherent Trinitarian doctrine rooted in Scripture.
- **Theological method as science** - Claim that theological disciplines can be disciplined, systematic, and rigorous like scientific inquiry when rooted in principial Scripture.
- **Triperspectival integration** - Use of normative, situational, and existential perspectives to ensure doctrinal coherence across loci.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological definition source** for principial, God-centered philosophical theology.
 - As a **polemic** resource against Molinism and autonomy-based philosophical theologies.
 - As an **exegetical model** for deriving doctrinal claims (Trinity, attributes) from biblical revelation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in courses integrating analytic philosophy with Reformed systematic theology.
