### TITLE
What About Tongue-Speaking? (1966) - Anthony Hoekema

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-1960s publication amid the early surge of the charismatic and renewed Pentecostal movements in North America and Europe. Written from a mid-20th-century Reformed evangelical vantage point anxious to respond theologically and pastorally to contemporary reports of glossolalia and "Spirit baptism."
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The practice of modern tongue-speaking (glossolalia) as promulgated by charismatic circles is not the normative biblical model of Spirit activity; tongues must be judged by Scripture's teaching on gifts, edification, and the purpose of miraculous signs.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical critique of key texts: Acts 2 and 10 (outward sign as xenoglossy in the apostolic age) and 1 Corinthians 12-14 (regulation for gifts, primacy of intelligibility and edification).
 - Distinction between biblical instances of known languages (xenoglossy) and ecstatic, unintelligible glossolalia of modern movements.
 - Theological placement of tongues among "sign gifts" with a historical, temporary function correlated to the apostolic age; contemporary tongues are either psychological/ecstatic phenomena or misapplied gifts, not normative evidence of Spirit baptism.
 - Pastoral and ecclesiological implications: order in worship, requirement of interpretation, and focus on sanctification and congregational edification rather than sensational experience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Charismatic and Pentecostal advocacy of contemporary tongues (unnamed movement leaders), classic cessationist thinkers and Reformed theologians implicitly engaged; biblical commentators on Acts and 1 Corinthians; appeals to church order and historic Protestant theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Pneumatology (Spirit baptism, gifts), ecclesiology (worship order, edification), revelation (continuity/cessation of revelatory gifts), sanctification (spiritual maturity and fruit vs. spectacle).
- **Closing line:** Hoekema insists that true Spirit-work serves Christ's building of the church and the believer's sanctification, and therefore tongues, when divorced from intelligible edification and biblical purpose, must be critically reappraised and restrained in faithful Christian worship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that biblical criteria for gifts are normative: intelligibility, interpretation, and congregational edification trump private ecstatic experience.
 - Pastoral concern for how tongues affect sanctification: warns that spectacle can impede genuine spiritual growth.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Pentecostal/charismatic claims that glossolalia is the invariable sign of Spirit baptism and a continuing normative sign gift.
 - Contrasts with charismatic theology by affirming a functional and temporal reading of "sign gifts" - they served the foundation and apostolic witness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear operational distinction between xenoglossy (known foreign languages in Acts) and ecstatic glossolalia (modern practice), using academic terms to separate phenomena often conflated.
 - Rearticulation of cessationist reasoning around sanctification and church order rather than solely philosophical skepticism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Credibly influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise pastoral and theological resource against charismatic excesses.
 - Criticized or disputed by pro-charismatic scholars who argue for continuationism and experiential validation of Spirit gifts.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Model of combining close exegesis, Reformed theological commitments, and pastoral prudence.
 - Useful for class or pulpit use when teaching on gifts, worship order, and the relation between charismatic phenomena and sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glossolalia:** Modern ecstatic speech often unintelligible; Hoekema treats this critically and distinguishes it from biblical instances.
- **Xenoglossy:** Known foreign languages miraculously spoken/heard in Acts; presented as the specific apostolic sign phenomenon.
- **Spirit baptism:** Distinguished from subsequent charismatic claims - not properly equated with contemporaneous glossolalia as necessary evidence.
- **Sign gifts:** Miraculous gifts (tongues, healing, signs) with a foundational/apostolic function which Hoekema treats as historically limited.
- **Continuationism vs. cessationism:** Hoekema argues a moderated cessationist position: certain revelatory/sign gifts fulfilled a once-for-all role.
- **Interpretation (1 Cor. 14):** Essential requirement for tongues to be proper in corporate worship; without it tongues are disorderly and non-edifying.
- **Edification:** Central normative criterion for gift use in the church - does the gift build up the body?
- **Sanctification:** Spiritual maturity and moral formation; used as a metric to evaluate whether experiential phenomena are spiritually beneficial.
- **Regulative concerns:** Worship order and scriptural rule for public assembly - Hoekema appeals to these to limit sensationalism.
- **Private prayer language:** Considered possible but subordinate; must not be elevated to corporate proof of Spirit baptism.
- **Ecstatic phenomena:** Psychological or emotional experiences that require ecclesial discernment and biblical testing.
- **Revelation vs. confirmation:** Distinguishes ongoing subjective experiences from normative public revelation needed for doctrine.
- **Pastoral prudence:** Recurrent theme: restraint, instruction, and assessment rather than uncritical acceptance.

How this work is commonly used:
- As a concise **definition source** distinguishing biblical tongues from modern glossolalia.
- As a **polemic** and pastoral manual in Reformed circles against charismatic claims about Spirit baptism and normative gifts.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Acts and 1 Corinthians with ecclesial and sanctification-focused criteria.
