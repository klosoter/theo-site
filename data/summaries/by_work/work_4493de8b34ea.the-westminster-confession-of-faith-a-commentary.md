### TITLE
**The Westminster Confession of Faith: A Commentary - John Murray**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholarship; Murray (1888-1975), trained in the Scottish Reformed tradition, teaching at Westminster Theological Seminary. Written as a chapter-by-chapter theological and exegetical exposition of the 1646 Confession for a confessional, conservative Presbyterian/Reformed audience.
 - Purpose: to restate and defend classical Westminster theology against modernist, liberal, and certain novel evangelical movements while supplying pastoral and doctrinal clarity for ministers and students.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Confession is a faithful, scriptural synthesis of historic Reformed doctrine. Murray's task: to explicate its theology systematically and show its continuing relevance for biblical fidelity, ecclesial order, and pastoral piety.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Chapter-by-chapter commentary following the Confession's ordering.
 - Exegetical grounding: Murray grounds each article in Scripture, showing the text-historical basis of the Confession.
 - Systematic integration: links doctrines into a covenantal, federal framework (works/ grace; headship; union with Christ).
 - Polemical application: corrects contemporary misunderstandings (liberal revisionism, pietistic reductionism, charismatic distortions).
 - Method: careful definition of terms, appeal to Scripture, citation of Reformed theologians (including Westminster divines and scholastic writers), and pastoral application.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: the Westminster divines, Reformed scholastics (e.g., Turretin), and 20th-century Protestant critics.
 - Critical engagement with modern trends: liberal higher criticism, Barthian reconfigurations, and emergent charismatic claims - especially where they touch sacramental theology and the doctrine of the Spirit.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture, Trinity, predestination, covenant theology (works and grace), Christology and atonement, union with Christ, justification and assurance, sanctification, sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper), church and civil magistrate, last things.
 - Specific attention to **God's attributes** (distinctions of absolute and relative attributes) and the person and work of the Holy Spirit (including Murray's treatment of **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**).

- **Closing line**
 - Murray's commentary locates the Confession as a rigorous, Scripture-rooted system: covenantal, Christ-centered, and pastorally robust - the standard for confessional Reformed orthodoxy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong covenantal framing: doctrines are primarily read through federal headship and union with Christ.
 - Balanced exegetical-pastoral tone: technical enough for seminary, accessible for ministers.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal denials of doctrinal certainties and the privatization of doctrine.
 - Contrasts with charismatic interpretations that detach Spirit-baptism from union with Christ and sacraments; Murray affirms a Reformed, non-Pentecostal account of Spirit baptism (see "Baptism of the Holy Spirit" entry).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies systematic uses of classic distinctions such as **absolute vs. relative attributes** of God to defend both divine transcendence and God's relational economy toward creation (see "Absolute And Relative Attributes").

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and churches as a reliable exegetical and confessional guide; influential in 20th-century conservative Presbyterian orthodoxy.
 - Cited in polemical debates over covenant theology, sacramental practice, and pneumatology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Precision in doctrinal definition, faithful Scripture exegesis, and utility in teaching the Confession as a coherent theological system.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession of Faith** - Murray's target text; treated as authoritative, systematic exposition of Scripture.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace** - Central organizing principle; Murray stresses federal headship and the continuity of God's covenantal dealings.
- **Union with Christ** - The pivotal soteriological concept linking justification, sanctification, and sacramental life.
- **Predestination / Election** - Defended as scriptural, pastoral, and consistent with God's justice and mercy.
- **Justification by faith** - Forensic, imputed righteousness; Murray insists on imputation over transformative-only models.
- **Sanctification** - Progressive, derivative from union with Christ; not identical with final glorification.
- **Sacraments: Baptism and Lord's Supper** - Signs and seals of covenant grace; instrumental in the believer's assurance, not means of meritorious righteousness.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** - Murray's usage:
 - Described as the Spirit's gracious, uniting work by which believers are incorporated into Christ; normally coincident with regeneration and faith.
 - Distinguished from later charismatic claims that equate Spirit-baptism primarily with extraordinary gifts or with a separate crisis experience.
 - Used to uphold sacramental and covenantal economy rather than a purely experiential pneumatology.
- **Absolute and Relative Attributes** - Murray employs this classic distinction:
 - **Absolute attributes**: properties of God in Himself (immutability, aseity, independence).
 - **Relative attributes**: attributes in relation to creatures (goodness, faithfulness) - used to explain how divine immutability coheres with God's covenantal actions.
- **Authority of Scripture** - Scripture as the supreme, sufficient norm for doctrine and life.
- **Regeneration** - Sovereign act of God initiating new life; foundational to faith and union with Christ.
- **Total Depravity** - Anthropological premise for need of sovereign grace.
- **Civil Magistrate** - Confessional teaching on church-state relations as articulated in the Confession.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed positions (systematics, homiletics).
 - As **polemic** against liberal revisionism and charismatic excesses (notably on Spirit-baptism).
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading the Confession textually and theologically; a conceptual pivot for teaching covenant theology.
