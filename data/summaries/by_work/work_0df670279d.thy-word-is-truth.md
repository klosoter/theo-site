### TITLE
Thy Word Is Truth - E. J. Young

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed and conservative evangelical milieu; E. J. Young as a leading Old Testament professor at Westminster Theological Seminary.
 - Responds to ascendant 19th-20th century critical schools (documentary/form criticism, liberal historiography) and to Neo‑Orthodox reactions that relativize propositional truth.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Old Testament is the divinely inspired, authoritative, and truthful revelation of God; its historical claims, prophetic predictions, and theological teachings are trustworthy and must be read with grammatical‑historical fidelity.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: exposition of modern critical claims that undermine OT authority (fragmentary origins, mythologizing, demythologizing).
 - Positive case for inspiration: theological and exegetical demonstration that the OT exhibits unity, prophetic veracity, and theological coherence that point to divine origin.
 - Polemic: systematic rebuttal of documentary hypothesis and selective higher criticism, arguing for continuity of authorship, tradition, and canonical shaping under divine providence.
 - Methodological insistence on rigorous Hebrew philology, contextually responsible exegesis, and use of historical data (archaeology, parallels) to confirm OT reliability.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Targets: representatives of higher criticism (Wellhausen and later form/documentary critics), myth/functional readings, and Neo‑Orthodox devaluation of propositional revelation.
 - Resources: Scripture itself, patristic and Reformed confessional appeals, contemporary conservative OT scholarship and philological tools.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (plenary, verbal emphasis as applied to the OT).
 - Authority and inerrancy of Scripture.
 - Prophecy (predictive fulfillment as proof of divine authorship).
 - Canon, history, and covenantal theology as framing categories for OT interpretation.
 - Secondary: typology and Christological readings of OT texts.
- **Closing line (work's theological center)**
 - Scripture, particularly the Old Testament, is a single, divinely given, trustworthy revelation whose truth claims-historical and theological-must be upheld against modern critical reductions.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, sustained defense of predictive prophecy as a central apologetic for divine inspiration rather than merely typological or theological post‑factum readings.
 - Integration of careful Hebrew linguistic and literary analysis with theological claims about inspiration-insistence that philology supports, not undermines, confidence in Scripture.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals**
 - Contrasts with the documentary/form critics by arguing for traditional patterns of authorship and editorial continuity under providence rather than mere late compilation.
 - Pushes back on Neo‑Orthodox theologians who deny propositional truth, insisting that revelation conveys objective truth accessible to historical exegesis.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not so much innovation as forceful application: the work tightens the classic Reformed formulations of plenary inspiration to Old Testament data and vocabulary, giving a practical exegetical program for defending that thesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - High influence within mid‑20th century conservative Reformed and evangelical circles; used as a standard apologetic text defending OT authority.
 - Limited traction among mainstream critical scholarship but continues to inform conservative seminary training and apologetics.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models a disciplined, text‑centered, confessional response to critical challenges; useful for students learning to marry philology and theology in defense of biblical authority.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - affirmed as divine origin of Scripture, applied explicitly to the OT with a plenary/verbal stress.
- **Inerrancy / Truth of Scripture** - Scripture's propositional statements are treated as reliable in their historical and theological claims.
- **Grammatical‑historical method** - the hermeneutical norm Young advocates for reading OT texts responsibly.
- **Predictive prophecy** - emphasized as empirical evidence for divine authorship when prophecy is fulfilled.
- **Documentary hypothesis / Higher criticism** - critiqued as undermining canonical coherence and historical reliability.
- **Canonical unity** - argument that the OT exhibits theological and redemptive continuities inconsistent with mere fragmentary origin theories.
- **Typology / Christological reading** - used to connect OT data to New Testament fulfillment while maintaining historical claims.
- **Covenant theology** - underlying frame for interpreting OT institutions and promises as coherent within God's redemptive plan.
- **Philology / Hebrew exegesis** - methodologically central; linguistic detail supports theological conclusions rather than replacing them.
- **Historicist / archaeological confirmation** - auxiliary use of external data to corroborate OT historicity.
- **Polemic** - the work functions as a direct rebuttal to critical and theological relativizing moves.
- **Apologetic model** - marries exegetical detail with theological defense of Scripture's authority.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative/Reformed accounts of inspiration and inerrancy.
- As a **polemic** and teaching tool against higher criticism and Neo‑Orthodoxy.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how philology and theological conviction can be integrated in OT studies.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in apologetics, especially the argument from fulfilled prophecy to divine authorship.
