### TITLE
**The Courage to Be** (1952) - Paul Tillich

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Postwar Europe and American academy; rise of existentialism, crisis of meaning, Cold War anxiety.
 - Tillich straddles liberal Protestantism and existential ontology; conversant with Heidegger, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche; in dialogue with neo-orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - How finite persons can **affirm being** in the face of **nonbeing** (death, meaninglessness, guilt).
 - True courage is the **self-affirmation of one's being** grounded in the **ground of being** (God) rather than in finite supports.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Maps modern anxiety in three forms: **fate/death**, **guilt/condemnation**, **emptiness/meaninglessness**.
 - Traces historical types of courage:
 - **Stoic/ontic** courage against fate and death.
 - **Moral** courage against guilt through fulfilling duty.
 - **Spiritual/romantic/existential** courage confronting meaninglessness.
 - Shows the insufficiency of autonomous or collectivist self-affirmations; both collapse into despair or idolatry of the finite.
 - Proposes **theonomy**: self-affirmation grounded in God as **being-itself**, culminating in the formula: the courage to be is the **courage to accept acceptance**.
 - Climaxes in the **God above the God of theism**: when images of a finite, object-like deity fail, faith discovers God as the **ground and abyss of being**.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Classical/modern: Plato, the Stoa, Spinoza; Luther (acceptance), Kierkegaard (despair), Nietzsche (nihilism), Heidegger (being and anxiety), Freud (depth psychology).
 - Engages and critiques: Barthian personalism, secular humanism, collectivist ideologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Theology proper**: God as **being-itself**, beyond subject-object; symbolic God-talk.
 - **Anthropology / creation**: finitude, participation and individuation, estrangement.
 - **Doctrine of sin**: anxiety as the mark of estrangement; guilt and self-loss.
 - **Soteriology**: grace as unconditional acceptance enabling courage; hints of the **New Being** in Christ.
 - **Trinity/Christology**: gestures to Christ as bearer of the New Being; minimal trinitarian development.
 - **Bibliology / revelation**: symbols mediate the ground of being; critique of literalism and mythless rationalism.
- **Closing line**
 - The book contends that human self-affirmation endures only when grounded in God as the **ground of being**, discovered in the act of accepting that we are accepted.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes salvation as existential **courage** given by **grace** rather than moral striving.
 - An ontological-existential reading of **anxiety** as revelation of creaturely finitude.
 - God as **being-itself** and the **God above the God of theism** to defeat idolatry of finite images.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Against optimistic liberalism: names the depth of nihilism and meaninglessness.
 - Against strict neo-orthodoxy: insists on mediation through culture, philosophy, and symbols, not only proclamation.
 - Against moralism and collectivism: rejects grounding courage in duty or the state; both are finite and finally anxious.
- **Innovations**
 - **Correlation method** implied: existential questions answered by theological symbols.
 - Triadic analysis of anxiety (death, guilt, meaninglessness) mapping to forms of courage.
 - Lexicon of **participation/individuation** and **heteronomy/autonomy/theonomy**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in pastoral theology, counseling, and public theology for diagnosing modern anxiety.
 - Critiqued in Reformed circles for impersonalizing God and attenuating the Trinity and atonement (Barth, Pannenberg, Torrance).
 - Appropriated selectively: analysis of idolatry of finite absolutes; language of acceptance as pastoral resource.
- **Enduring value**
 - A durable conceptual map for engaging secular despair.
 - A stimulus for revisiting doctrines of God, sin, and grace in existential register, even where one rejects Tillich's ontology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Being-itself / ground of being**: God as the depth of all that is, not a highest being among others.
- **Nonbeing**: threat to finite existence; source of anxiety manifest in death, guilt, and meaninglessness.
- **Anxiety**: ontological awareness of nonbeing; distinguished from fear (which has an object).
 - Three forms: **fate/death**, **guilt/condemnation**, **emptiness/meaninglessness**.
- **Courage to be**: self-affirmation of being in spite of nonbeing; ultimately grounded theologically.
- **Accepting acceptance**: soteriological moment where grace overcomes estrangement and empowers courage.
- **God above the God of theism**: the living God discovered when finite images of God collapse.
- **Participation and individuation**: the tension of belonging to being while being a distinct self.
- **Heteronomy, autonomy, theonomy**: law from outside, from the self, and from God-in-depth reconciling the two.
- **Estrangement**: Tillich's analogue to sin; disrupted relation to being, God, self, and others.
- **Ultimate concern**: faith's directedness to the ultimate; wards off idolatry of penultimate concerns.
- **Symbol**: language that participates in the reality it points to; key for revelation and liturgy.
- **New Being**: Christological hint of healing estrangement, grounding courage.
- **The Protestant principle**: perpetual critique of finite absolutes in church and culture.

- **Uses across loci**
 - **Theology proper**: as a conceptual foil and vocabulary for God's transcendence (ground vs highest being).
 - **Doctrine of sin and soteriology**: to frame estrangement, anxiety, and grace as acceptance.
 - **Anthropology/creation**: to analyze finitude, meaning, and the self's participation in being.
 - **Bibliology/Trinity**: as a cautionary dialogue partner on symbolism and the risks of de-personalizing God.
