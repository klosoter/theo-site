### TITLE
**The End for Which God Created the World** - Jonathan Edwards

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Composed mid-18th century New England; published posthumously in 1765 alongside the companion Dissertation Concerning the Nature of True Virtue. Within post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy, yet dialoguing with early modern moral sense philosophy and responding to deist and Arminian currents after the Great Awakening.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** God is His own ultimate end in creation; the highest, final end is the **communication and refulgence of God's glory** in creatures, returning to God in their knowing, esteeming, loving, and rejoicing in Him.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Ultimate vs subordinate ends:** Distinguishes ends that are valued in themselves (God's glory) from means or partial ends (order of nature, creature happiness, redemption).
 - **Biblical demonstration:** Surveys Scripture's purposive language: for His name's sake, to the praise of His glory, that He might be known, feared, and worshiped by all nations.
 - **Rational demonstration:** Given divine aseity and perfection, God must value most what is most valuable, namely Himself; therefore divine self-regard is requisite to perfect benevolence. God's regard to Himself coincides with the true public good, since God is the supreme and comprehensive Good.
 - **Creature happiness reframed:** Creature blessedness is an integral component of the last end only insofar as it is beatitude in God; mere natural or self-referential happiness is not ultimate.
 - **Sin and providence considered:** God's permitting and ordering of all things serves the maximal display of His attributes, never as an end in sin itself but as a means to the manifestation of justice, mercy, wisdom, and power (Divine Foreknowledge Providence And The Problem Of Evil).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Heavy biblical appeal; in conversation with Augustinian and Reformed traditions; countering Arminian and deistic anthropocentrism; conceptually proximate to classical theistic accounts of final causality and divine simplicity; interacts implicitly with moral sense thinkers.
- **Doctrines treated:** Doctrine of God (aseity, simplicity, glory), creation and providence, teleology, decrees, worship, soteriology, and ethics.
- **Closing line:** God's ultimate end is God Himself, glorified through the creature's God-centered delight that mirrors and magnifies His infinite fullness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Emanation/communication** of divine fullness that returns to God as acknowledged glory.
 - Alignment of **divine self-love and benevolence**: loving God supremely is loving the sum of being and the public good.
 - **Aesthetic teleology:** excellence as harmonious consent and escalating beauty in God-known-and-enjoyed.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against anthropocentric accounts that make creature happiness in itself the last end; happiness in God is constitutive, not competitive, with God's glory.
 - Clarifies that God's seeking His glory is not neediness but the fitting expression of infinite plenitude.
 - Recasts theodicy as teleology of manifestation, not mere free-will defense (without denying responsible agency).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Rigorous taxonomy of **ultimate**, **chief**, and **subordinate** ends.
 - Distinction between **intrinsic glory** and its **emanation/recognition**.
 - Identification of the **public good** with the diffusion of the divine good.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Catalyzed New Divinity (Hopkins, Emmons) and shaped Princeton (Hodge, Warfield); significant for Andrew Fuller and Baptist confessional theology; popularized in modern evangelicalism via the axiom, God is most glorified in us when we are most satisfied in Him.
 - Offers a stable frame for doctrines of creation, worship, mission, and election (Divine Decrees Election And Reprobation).
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a God-centered teleology that integrates exegesis, metaphysics, and spirituality.
 - Serves as a template for aligning ethics, doxology, and mission to the divine last end, including counterfactual scenarios about redemptive history's path (What If Adam Had Not Sinned).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Glory of God:** God's intrinsic excellence and its outward radiance in knowledge, love, and praise.
- **Ultimate end / last end:** The final cause valued for its own sake; for Edwards, God's glory.
- **Subordinate end:** Means or partial goods ordered to the last end (creation order, redemption, sanctification).
- **Emanation / communication of fullness:** Overflow of divine plenitude into creaturely participation.
- **Aseity:** God's self-sufficiency; grounds why God must be His own last end.
- **Divine simplicity:** No competition between self-love and benevolence in God; one simple act ordered to Himself as the highest good.
- **Name / for His name's sake:** Biblical idiom for God's public reputation and manifested glory in history.
- **Public good:** The common good rightly defined by maximal participation in God's own good.
- **Beatitude in God:** Creature happiness consisting in the vision, love, and joy of God.
- **Manifestation of attributes:** Justice, mercy, wisdom, and power displayed in providence and redemption.
- **Final cause vs efficient cause:** Why God created vs how God acts; Edwards centers the final cause.
- **Praise / worship:** Creaturely acknowledgment that completes the circle of communicated glory returning to God.
- **Consent / beauty:** Harmonious union of creaturely affections to God's worth, underwriting the ethical dimension of glory.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Doctrine of God and creation:** Definitive account of divine ends, grounding teleology across dogmatics.
 - **Providence and theodicy:** Conceptual pivot for explaining evil's permission as subordinated to glory.
 - **Election and mission:** Frames soteriology and missiology around the praise of God's glorious grace.
 - **Ethics and worship:** Exegetical and conceptual model for God-centered virtue and doxology.
