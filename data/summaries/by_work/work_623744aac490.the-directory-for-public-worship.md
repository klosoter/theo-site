### TITLE
**The Directory for the Publick Worship of God** (1644-1645), Westminster Assembly

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** English Civil War; Puritan-Presbyterian reform; replacement for the Anglican Book of Common Prayer under Parliamentary authority; adopted by the Church of Scotland (1645). Milieu marked by anti-Laudian, anti-Roman reaction and a drive for biblical simplicity and pastoral edification.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How to order public worship according to Scripture alone, avoiding set forms that breed superstition or formalism, while still guiding ministers toward reverent, edifying, and theologically rich services.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - No fixed liturgy; a Directory giving principles and models.
 - Elements of worship: public reading of Scripture, preaching, prayer, singing of psalms, sacraments, and collections for the poor.
 - Detailed guidance for pastoral prayer (before and after sermon), catechising, days of fasting and thanksgiving, sanctifying the Lord's Day, marriage, visitation of the sick, and burial of the dead (without rites of superstition).
 - Sacramental directives: Baptism and the Lord's Supper administered with self-examination, fencing of the table, and avoidance of ceremonial excess.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Westminster divines (e.g., Gillespie, Rutherford, Henderson, Gouge); Reformed precedent from Calvin and Knox; in conversation against the Book of Common Prayer, Laudian ceremonialism, and Roman Catholic liturgy; also steering between Enthusiast antinomianism and rigid ritualism.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - **Bibliology:** sufficiency and public reading of Scripture, lectio continua, faithful translation.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** ordinary means, ministerial office, catechesis, discipline at the table, marriage, corporate fasts/thanksgivings.
 - **Christology:** Christ as the only Mediator whose benefits are exhibited in Word and sacrament.
 - **Pneumatology:** dependence on the Spirit for extemporaneous prayer and effectual ministry.
 - **Soteriology:** preaching repentance and faith, self-examination, assurance, sanctification.
 - **Eschatology:** Lord's Day as foretaste of rest; burial practices grounded in resurrection hope.
- **Closing line:** Scripture-governed, Spirit-dependent, Christ-centered simplicity for the edification and purity of the church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Directory not liturgy:** rejects fixed forms; provides robust models and guardrails.
 - **Preaching centrality:** extended guidance on sermon preparation, delivery, and prayer framing.
 - **Psalmody:** prioritizes congregational singing of canonical psalms.
 - **Fencing the table:** pastoral examination and warning to preserve the Supper's integrity.
 - **Sabbath sanctification:** Lord's Day as whole-day holy rest in public and private worship.
 - **Minimal rites for burial and marriage:** no prayers for the dead; sobriety against superstition.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **Laudian/Prayer Book** ceremonial and set forms; against **Roman** sacramentalism.
 - Against **Enthusiast** formlessness: insists on ordered elements grounded in Scripture.
 - Against **holy days** (save the Lord's Day); replaces with occasional fasts and thanksgivings.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operationalizes the **regulative principle of worship** (WCF 21) in pastoral detail.
 - Clarifies **ordinary means of grace** as the church's weekly diet.
 - Embeds **lectio continua** and comprehensive pastoral prayer patterns.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Normative in Scotland; formative for English-speaking Presbyterianism; influenced Puritan and later Free Church traditions; eclipsed in England at the Restoration but revived in Presbyterian polities; templates many modern Presbyterian directories.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A concise pastoral theology of worship; a stable reference for Reformed ordering of Lord's Day services and sacred ordinances; catechetical utility for congregational formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regulative principle of worship:** God alone determines elements of worship in Scripture; the Directory applies this normatively.
- **Ordinary means of grace:** Word, sacraments, prayer as weekly, central conduits of Christ's benefits.
- **Public reading of Scripture:** substantial, reverent, and intelligible reading; favors lectio continua.
- **Pastoral prayer:** model content (adoration, confession, thanksgiving, intercession, illumination).
- **Preaching of the Word:** careful exposition, Christ-centered application, doctrinal and practical aims.
- **Psalmody:** congregational singing of psalms; simplicity over performance.
- **Sanctifying the Lord's Day:** public and private exercises; rejection of secular employments.
- **Baptism:** covenantal, ordinarily in public worship, with parental vows and congregational witness.
- **Lord's Supper:** self-examination, fencing the table, warning and comfort, simple administration.
- **Fencing the table:** pastoral admission and warning to protect the sacrament from profanation.
- **Days of public humiliation:** corporate fasting and repentance in extraordinary providences.
- **Public thanksgiving:** services marking notable mercies of God.
- **Catechising:** regular instruction of youth and families by ministers and heads of households.
- **Visitation of the sick:** consolation, admonition, prayer grounded in providence and hope.
- **Burial of the dead:** graveside sobriety without rites implying merit or prayers for the dead.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** as a model for Scripture's primacy in worship practice and proclamation.
 - **Ecclesiology & Sacraments:** as normative guidance for the elements and administration.
 - **Christology/Pneumatology:** as a paradigm for Christ-mediated, Spirit-enabled prayer and preaching.
 - **Eschatology/Soteriology:** as a pastoral framework for Lord's Day hope and gospel-centered self-examination.
