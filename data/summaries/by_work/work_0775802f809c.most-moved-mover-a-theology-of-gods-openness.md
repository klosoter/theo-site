### TITLE
Most Moved Mover: A Theology of God's Openness - Clark Pinnock

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical theology (Pinnock: Baker, 2001). Emerges from evangelical/charismatic circles reacting to classical theism and deterministic providence; follows and refines debates begun in the 1990s around The Openness of God (1994). Engages analytic philosophy, biblical theology, and pastoral concerns.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** God is genuinely relational and responsive: divine knowledge and providence allow for real interaction with free creatures. Openness preserves divine sovereignty while affirming that the future contains genuine possibilities not exhaustively fixed in divine foreknowledge.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Biblical-theological opening: scriptural portrait of a God who speaks, repents, relents, grieves, and invites partnership.
 - Philosophical critique: rejects classical strict immutability and exhaustive definite foreknowledge as incompatible with biblical relationality and libertarian human freedom.
 - Constructive proposal: God knows all that is knowable - actuals and possibilities - and takes risk by creating a world with creaturely freedom; God is the "most moved mover": the primary initiator who is nonetheless truly affected by creatures.
 - Pneumatological and Christological integration: the Spirit is central to revelation, ongoing guidance, and illumination; the incarnation models divine condescension and risk.
 - Pastoral and practical implications: prayer, divine suffering, providence, and mission reinterpreted in light of a responsive God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine and Aquinas (classical tradition), contemporary defenders of classical attributes (e.g., Alvin Plantinga, William Lane Craig), proponents of open theism (John Sanders, Gregory Boyd), critics from conservative Reformed circles; wide use of biblical narrative, prophetic literature, and New Testament pneumatology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and illumination (pneumatology), omniscience, providence, divine immutability/passibility, Trinity, Christology (kenosis and condescension), prayer, human freedom, prophecy.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Pinnock reframes God as the "most moved mover": supremely sovereign and initiatory, yet vulnerably and relationally engaged - a God who authentically enters a future shared with creatures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases / formulations:**
 - Coining and systematic use of the phrase **"most moved mover"** to capture a God who moves the world while being moved by it.
 - Strong pneumatological emphasis: the **Holy Spirit** as the active agent of revelation, illumination, and present guidance (see: Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination).
 - Articulation of divine **risk-taking** and real-time responsiveness as positive theological goods.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Moves beyond classical impassibility by arguing that biblical pathos in God is normative, not merely anthropomorphic.
 - Rejects Molinist middle knowledge as insufficient to secure both genuine creaturely freedom and authentic divine relationality.
 - Distinguishes open theism from process theology: God remains creator, omnipotent in purpose, and morally perfect while permitting genuine contingency.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts **openness** as a theological category that integrates providence, revelation, and relationality.
 - Frames **divine condescension** as a model of God's willingness to enter contingent relationships (see: Open Theism And Divine Condescension).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential and controversial in evangelical and charismatic contexts; galvanized debates on Scripture, prayer, and providence.
 - Generated sustained critique from conservative Reformed theologians and robust engagement from progressive evangelicals.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provokes reexamination of biblical texts on divine emotion, repentance, and dialogue.
 - Serves as a pedagogical bridge between philosophical theology and pastoral concerns (prayer, suffering, mission).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Most Moved Mover:** Pinnock's central metaphor - God who initiates but is genuinely affected by creatures.
- **Openness of God:** The claim that some aspects of the future are not exhaustively settled; God knows possibilities and actuals but allows genuine creaturely initiative.
- **Divine Passibility / Relational Sovereignty:** God can be moved by relational encounters without losing sovereignty.
- **Omniscience (reconfigured):** Full knowledge of the past and present and perfect knowledge of possible futures; not exhaustive definite foreknowledge of all future free choices.
- **Providence (relational):** Sovereign guidance that permits contingency and cooperative interaction with creation.
- **Holy Spirit (revelation & illumination):** Active agent in progressive revelation, present guidance, and real-time illumination of possibilities (see: Role Of The Holy Spirit In Revelation And Illumination).
- **Divine Condescension:** God's self-emptying and willingness to enter vulnerability in creation and history (linked to kenosis and incarnation; see: Open Theism And Divine Condescension).
- **Risk-taking God:** Theological framing of divine action that includes genuine openness to creaturely response.
- **Prayer (efficacious persuasion):** Prayer as a real means by which humans influence God's actions within the open relational economy.
- **Human Freedom (libertarian):** Emphasis on genuine alternative possibilities and moral responsibility.
- **Prophecy & Contingency:** Prophecy as God's engagement with contingent history rather than mere deterministic decrees.
- **Kenosis / Incarnation:** Christological model supporting divine condescension and relational engagement.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for contemporary open theism in systematic theology and pneumatology.
 - As a **polemic** and conversation partner against classical immutability and exhaustive foreknowledge positions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings of Scripture emphasizing divine pathos, prophetic negotiation, and Spirit-led revelation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in pastoral theology, especially for prayer, suffering, and theodicy discussions.
