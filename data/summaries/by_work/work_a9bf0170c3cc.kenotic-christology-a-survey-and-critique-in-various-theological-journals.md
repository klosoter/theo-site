### TITLE
Kenotic Christology: A Survey and Critique - Donald Macleod

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Late 20th-century evangelical-Reformed scholarship responding to a resurgence of kenotic proposals in modern systematic and historical theology. Macleod writes as an engaged critic within conservative Reformed circles seeking to defend Chalcedonian orthodoxy against perceived innovations.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Phil 2:6-8 and related texts are widely appealed to for a doctrine of "divine self-emptying" (kenosis). The question is whether the Son relinquished divine attributes (ontological kenosis) or merely assumed human limitations without loss of deity (economic/functional kenosis). Macleod argues that ontological kenosis is theologically untenable; the incarnation involved voluntary self-limitation in exercise, not a subtraction of divine being or attributes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of major kenotic models: classical (no divestment of attributes), functional/economic kenosis (voluntary non-use), and radical/ontological kenosis (actual loss or change in divine attributes).
 - Exegetical assessment of key texts (Philippians 2:6-8; Hebrews; Gospel narratives) arguing they describe humiliation and legitimate human limits, not metaphysical subtraction.
 - Theological critique using classical categories: immutability, impassibility, omniscience/omnipotence, communicatio idiomatum, and the Chalcedonian distinction of two natures in one person.
 - Positive proposal: preserve Chalcedonian / classical theism by locating kenosis in the mode of operation (what the Son chooses not to exercise) rather than in the divine essence (what the Son ceases to be).
- **Figures / sources engaged:** Survey of historical kenotic proponents and modern proponents (various 19th-20th c. theologians and contemporary systematic theologians), primary exegetical appeals (Pauline and Johannine corpus), and classic patristic and Chalcedonian texts; interlocutors include both evangelical critics and pro-kenotic academic voices.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (incarnation, person and natures), Trinity (relations of persons, divine attributes), revelation (how God is acting and disclosing in the incarnation), atonement (implications of kenosis for redemptive efficacy), and classical attributes (immutability, impassibility, omniscience, omnipotence).
- **Closing line:** Macleod defends a measured Reformed orthodoxy: the Son did not divest divine being in the incarnation; kenosis is best understood as a voluntary, economic self-limitation in the exercise of attributes compatible with Chalcedonian two‑natures theology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Careful analytic distinction between *ontological* and *economic/functional* kenosis as decisive for orthodoxy.
 - Strong insistence that divine attributes are not transferable or subtractable without undermining God's identity.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects readings of Phil 2 that treat the hymn as metaphysical proof the Son ceased to be divine in aspects.
 - Pushes back on radical kenotists who treat the incarnation as ontological metamorphosis rather than voluntary self-limitation.
- **Conceptual / terminological clarifications:**
 - Clarifies use of *kenosis* language: distinguishes mode of exercise (non‑use) from loss of property.
 - Reasserts the communicatio idiomatum under Chalcedonian constraints: properties of each nature may be predicated to the person without implying cross‑nature elimination of attributes.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical critiques of kenotic theology; used as a survey-plus-polemic in journal literature.
 - Less persuasive to process theologians and some liberal/continental pro-kenotic proponents, who remain committed to stronger reinterpretations of divine immutability.
- **Enduring value:** Clear pedagogical framework for distinguishing acceptable from unacceptable forms of kenosis; useful bridge between biblical exegesis and systematic categories.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis:** "Emptying" language (Phil 2) - contested whether metaphorical (humiliation) or metaphysical (loss of attributes).
- **Ontological kenosis:** Claim that the Son literally divested divine attributes - Macleod rejects as theologically unsupportable.
- **Economic / functional kenosis:** The Son voluntarily refrains from exercising some divine prerogatives while remaining fully God - Macleod affirms this construal as orthodox.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** The communication of properties between Christ's natures - used to defend predication without endorsing ontological subtraction.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** The two natures, unconfused and unaltered, in one person - the normative framework for Macleod's critique.
- **Immutability:** Divine constancy - invoked to argue against real change in God's essence during incarnation.
- **Impassibility:** Freedom from suffering in divine essence - distinction maintained between divine impassibility and the Son's human experience of suffering.
- **Omniscience / omnipotence in incarnation:** Treated as attributes whose exercise could be voluntarily limited without loss of status.
- **Philippians 2:6-8 (exegesis):** Read as hymn of voluntary humility and obedience, not metaphysical subtraction.
- **Two natures / one person:** Central Christological category to resist attribute-divestment readings.
- **Voluntary self-limitation:** Macleod's preferred language for kenotic action in Christ.
- **Functional non‑use vs. loss:** Key analytic distinction; keeps divine essence intact while explaining human experience.
- **Soteriological implications:** Kenosis framed so as not to undermine the sufficiency and efficacy of the atonement.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for clarifying kenosis categories (ontological vs economic).
- As a **polemic** tool against radical kenotic proposals that risk compromising Chalcedonian Christology.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Phil 2 within classical theological commitments.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching Christology where one must balance incarnation's mystery with classical theism.
