### TITLE
The Christ and the Spirit, Vol. 1: Christology (James D. G. Dunn, 1998)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century New Testament scholarship; part of Dunn's larger project on the interrelation of Christology and pneumatology. Emerging from the British school of NT studies that emphasizes rigorous exegetical work rooted in history of earliest Christianity.
 - Dialogue with the New Perspective(s) on Paul, and with contemporary pneumatology (e.g., Moltmann, Wright), and post-Bultmannian exegetical trends.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Spirit is indispensable to any adequate New Testament Christology: the identity, ministry, death and vindication (resurrection/exaltation) of Jesus must be read through the lens of the Spirit as the operative divine power in Jesus and the early church.
 - Problem addressed: how to integrate diverse NT Christological statements with the pneumatological data without collapsing one into the other or treating the Spirit as merely an afterthought.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-narrative reading of the Gospels and Epistles showing Jesus as *Spirit-endowed* agent:
 - Jesus' baptism as Spirit-conferral and commissioning.
 - Ministry characterized by prophetic and charismatic empowerment (healing, exorcism, proclamation).
 - Death as culmination of vocation; vindication (resurrection/exaltation) is fundamentally an act of the Spirit.
 - Comparative analysis of Paul, Luke-Acts, John and other NT literature to demonstrate convergences and variations in how Spirit and Christ are related.
 - Theological synthesis arguing for a pneumatological hermeneutic of Christology: Spirit explains both the historical Jesus and the early church's high Christological confession.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: New Testament corpus (Pauline letters, Luke-Acts, Johannine writings, synoptics).
 - Secondary interlocutors: E. P. Sanders, J. D. G. Dunn's contemporaries (e.g., N. T. Wright), Moltmann and other modern theologians concerned with Spirit-Christ relations; engagement with earlier exegetical traditions and creedal formulations.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (historical and exaltation Christology), Pneumatology, Resurrection, Adoption, Revelation, Trinity (as implicit theological framework), Ecclesiology (as corollary).

- **Closing line**
 - Dunn locates the theological center of gravity in a **pneumatological Christology**: the Spirit is the key to understanding Jesus' messianic identity, ministry, and vindication, and thus to bridging the historical Jesus and high Christological confession.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Jesus principally as a *Spirit-anointed* agent rather than only via metaphysical pre-existence claims; stresses continuity between Jesus' own ministry and the post-resurrection church through the Spirit.
 - Reads resurrection and exaltation explicitly as Spirit-led/vindicating acts, shifting emphasis from purely juridical or metaphysical models to pneumatological dynamics.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that isolate Christology from pneumatology or that prioritize ontological pre-existence as the primary explanation for high Christology.
 - Challenges scholars who subordinate the Spirit to Christological categories by arguing the reverse: the Spirit is often the explanatory principle in NT texts.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Articulation of a cohesive "pneumatological hermeneutic" for NT Christology that treats Spirit, ministry, and resurrection as a theological triad rather than discrete loci.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in New Testament and theological studies as a corrective emphasizing the Spirit in Christological formulation.
 - In Reformed circles: valued for exegetical clarity but sometimes critiqued for underplaying classical ontological Trinitarian formulations; used carefully in systematic theology as an exegetical resource rather than a full doctrinal system.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust exegetical model for integrating Spirit and Christ in NT theology; essential for courses on Christology, pneumatology, and resurrection studies. Its methodological insistence on NT data as primary continues to shape subsequent debate.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pneumatological Christology** - viewing Christological claims through the operative role of the Spirit.
- **Spirit-anointing / Spirit-endowment** - the Spirit as the empowering presence marking Jesus' vocation from baptism onward.
- **Baptism of Jesus** - pivotal event in Dunn's scheme: Spirit-conferral and commissioning, foundational for Jesus' messianic function.
- **Charismatic ministry** - healings, exorcisms, prophetic authority seen as evidence of Spirit-empowerment rather than merely symbolic signs.
- **Vindication (resurrection) by the Spirit** - resurrection and exaltation interpreted as acts in which the Spirit is the principal divine agent.
- **Exaltation / enthronement** - tied to Spirit-vindication and the inauguration of Christ's heavenly role.
- **Historical Jesus / early confessional Christology** - relation between the life of Jesus and the later church's high Christological statements mediated by Spirit-experience.
- **Functional vs. ontological Christology** - emphasis on what the Spirit does for Jesus' mission (functional) as distinct from metaphysical pre-existence (ontological).
- **New Testament witness** - Dunn's methodological insistence that variation across Paul, Luke, John informs theological synthesis.
- **Hermeneutic of continuity** - continuity between Jesus' Spirit-empowerment and the church's possession of the Spirit.
- **Adoption language** - linked to Spirit-baptism and vindication in Pauline texts.
- **Ecclesial continuation** - the church as continuation of Jesus' Spirit-empowered mission.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading NT Christology through pneumatology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in debates that seek to integrate resurrection, Spirit, and exaltation (useful in systematic pneumatology and Christology).
 - As a **polemic resource** against readings that marginalize the Spirit or isolate Christological doctrines from historical-narrative context.
