### TITLE
The New Evangelical Subordinationism? Perspectives on the Equality of God the Father and God the Son (contributor: Michael F. Bird)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical debates (2010s-2020s) over the doctrine of the Trinity, especially within Reformed/complementarian circles. The volume responds to renewed claims for *eternal functional subordination* (EFS) of the Son defended by some conservative evangelical theologians as a theological justification for hierarchical gender roles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The book asks whether a recent evangelical articulation of *eternal subordination of the Son* constitutes a legitimate development of Trinitarian doctrine or a reversion to subordinationism that compromises the ontological equality of Father and Son.
- **Core argument / structure (Bird's contribution summarized):**
 - Survey of recent evangelical proponents of EFS and their key claims: that authority/role distinctions between Father and Son are eternal and not merely economic.
 - Exegetical scrutiny of texts often appealed to for EFS (e.g., John, Pauline passages, especially 1 Corinthians and Philippians 2).
 - Historical-theological argument: contrasts patristic, medieval, and Reformation construals of relational distinctions in the Trinity with the EFS proposals.
 - Systematic-theological consequences: explores how EFS interacts with notions of *ousia* (essence), *hypostasis* (personhood), perichoresis, and the monarchy of the Father.
 - Pastoral and ecclesial ramifications, especially regarding male headship and ordination debates.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Contemporary defenders of EFS (e.g., Wayne Grudem, Bruce Ware), critical responders (various contributors), classical sources (Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus), Reformation confessions and modern systematicians (e.g., Barth, Rahner), and key biblical interpreters.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (immanent vs economic), Christology (eternal Sonship, hypostatic union), revelation and Scripture (exegetical methodology), ecclesiology and gender/ordination implications.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The collection - and Bird's contribution within it - defends the **ontological equality** of Father and Son while warning that asserting eternal functional subordination confuses economic order with intra-Trinitarian being and risks reviving classical subordinationism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Sharp differentiation between *ontological equality* (essence, status) and *economic order* (roles in creation/redemption).
 - Emphasis on classical Nicene and Cappadocian categories to diagnose contemporary deviations.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against EFS proponents who treat relational authority as intrinsic to divine being; insists authority must not be posited as an ontological property of a Person apart from the shared divine essence.
 - Reintegrates historical theological consensus against any eternal subordination that implies inequality.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Reclaims and clarifies terms like "eternal relation of origin" and insists on careful use of "submission" versus "economic obedience."
 - Labels the contemporary phenomenon as "new evangelical subordinationism" to mark its affinity with ancient subordinationist errors while noting distinct motives and contexts.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Important in evangelical circles as a major collected critique of EFS; frequently cited by conservative theologians who reject EFS and by scholastic-traditionalist defenders of Nicene orthodoxy.
 - Stimulated further exegetical and systematic responses, especially around Philippians 2 and Johannine theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Offers a compact yet rigorous resource for courses on Trinity, contemporary theological method, and the intersection of doctrine and church practice.
 - Functions as a corrective dossier for those assessing doctrinal developments that bear on ecclesial policies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal Functional Subordination (EFS):** The claim that the Son is eternally subordinate to the Father in role/authority; central target of critique.
- **Ontological equality:** Equality in being/essence shared by Father, Son, and Spirit; affirmed as non-negotiable.
- **Economic Trinity:** The way God acts in history (Father sending Son, Son submitting in mission); distinguished from the immanent Trinity.
- **Immanent Trinity:** The inner life and relations of the Godhead apart from creation; locus where EFS is judged problematic.
- **Subordinationism (classical):** Historical heresy positing inferiority of the Son's being to the Father; used as an analogical warning.
- **Perichoresis / Circumincession:** Mutual indwelling of the divine persons; invoked to protect against real division or hierarchy in essence.
- **Eternal relation of origin:** The Father as unbegotten cause, Son as eternally begotten - used to explain relational order without ontological inequality.
- **Hypostatic union:** Christological doctrine ensuring Son's full divinity alongside incarnation; guards against diminishing the Son's divine status.
- **Authority vs. Submission (terminological distinction):**
 - Authority: relational leadership within economic acts, not an ontological property.
 - Submission: voluntary, economic obedience in the mission of redemption.
- **Nicene consensus:** Reference point for orthodox Trinitarian boundaries against any ontological subordination.
- **Exegetical loci:** Key passages analyzed include John (relations language), Philippians 2 (kenosis), and 1 Corinthians (Headship language).
- **Monarchy of the Father:** Traditional affirmation of the Father's role as source without implying superiority of essence.
- **Complementarian application:** How Trinitarian claims are used to justify gender/authority structures; critiqued when grounded in EFS.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition and boundary source** for orthodox Trinitarian language (distinguishing economic vs immanent relations).
- As a **polemic resource** against evangelical proponents of EFS, especially where doctrine intersects ecclesial gender practice.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading contested New Testament passages without importing modern hierarchical categories.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking historical theology and contemporary ecclesial controversies.
