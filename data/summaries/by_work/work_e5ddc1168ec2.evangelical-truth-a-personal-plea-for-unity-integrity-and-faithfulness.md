### TITLE
**Evangelical Truth: A Personal Plea for Unity, Integrity and Faithfulness** 
Author: Unknown (anonymous/pseudonymous) 
Context: a contemporary evangelical manifesto addressing fragmentation within late-20th/early-21st-century Protestantism.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Written in the context of rising denominational fragmentation, charismatic controversies, and culture-facing mission debates within global evangelicalism.
 - Pastoral tone aimed at pastors, elders and thoughtful laity rather than academy-only readers.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The evangelical movement must reclaim a posture of unity grounded in the core gospel, maintaining doctrinal **integrity** and persevering in **faithfulness** to Scripture and mission while resisting sectarianism and syncretism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part 1: Diagnose the malaise-polarization over secondary issues, loss of public witness, and pastoral fatigue.
 - Part 2: Re-state essentials-Scripture, justification by faith, Christocentric preaching, and the realities of adoption and Spirit-work as non-negotiable markers of evangelical identity.
 - Part 3: Method for unity-principles for distinguishing essentials from adiaphora; pastoral practices to preserve charity without abandoning truth.
 - Part 4: Practical application-ecclesial formation, evangelistic focus, and proposals for charitable engagement across pneumatological (e.g., Baptism of the Holy Spirit) and sacramental debates.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals widely to Scripture as primary authority; dialogues implicitly with both classical evangelical voices (e.g., mid-century evangelical confessionalists) and contemporary charismatic and fundamentalist movements.
 - Critiques liberal theology, sectarian separatism, and uncritical ecumenism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and scriptural authority; soteriology (justification, **adoption**); pneumatology (including **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**); sanctification; ecclesiology (unity and witness); pastoral theology.
- **Closing line**
 - A call to a courageous but charitable evangelical identity: hold the gospel fast, preserve integrity in doctrine, and pursue unity competent to bear witness in a fractured world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - A pastoral, corrective tone that privileges relational and ecclesial unity without collapsing doctrinal distinctives.
 - Elevates **adoption** as a centripetal soteriological theme: believer identity, assurance, and mission derive from being sons and daughters in Christ.
 - Treats the **Baptism of the Holy Spirit** as a pneumatological reality to be discussed charitably-important for vitality but not to be weaponized as the sole criterion of authenticity.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both separatist legalism (which isolates over non-essentials) and experimental syncretism (which abandons doctrinal guardrails).
 - Contrasts with revivalistic polemics that read Spirit-empowerment solely through ecstatic markers; insists on Scripture-governed discernment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Coines a practical triad-**unity, integrity, faithfulness**-as a hermeneutical and ecclesial grid for decision-making across controversies.
 - Advocates the concept of "charitable orthodoxy": firmness in truth married to relational humility.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but recurring use among pastors and local church networks seeking mediating language between Charismatic and Reformed constituencies.
 - Cited in practitioner literature on church unity, pastoral formation, and pneumatological pastoral care.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pastoral primer for bridging intra-evangelical divides and a useful teaching aid in pastoral seminars on ecclesial unity and pneumatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Evangelical truth** - truth centered on the gospel of Christ as the criterion for unity and witness.
- **Unity** - ecclesial concord founded on shared gospel commitments, not uniformity of practice.
- **Integrity** - doctrinal honesty and pastoral consistency in preaching, sacraments, and life.
- **Faithfulness** - persevering obedience to Christ and Scripture amid cultural pressures.
- **Essentials vs. adiaphora** - a working taxonomy for distinguishing non-negotiable doctrines from practices permitting liberty.
- **Gospel** - proclamation of Christ's atoning work, justification by faith, and new life in the Spirit; the unifying center.
- **Adoption**
 - Presented as a central soteriological category: positional reality (legal sonship), experiential fruit (assurance, filial affection), and missional basis (witness as children of God).
 - Used to reframe Christian identity away from performance and toward relational sonship.
- **Baptism of the Holy Spirit**
 - Treated as a legitimate and consequential pneumatic reality; author encourages interpretive charity between those who locate it with conversion and those who view it as a distinct empowering event.
 - Emphasized as a means to sanctification and mission rather than an exclusivist badge of authenticity.
- **Pneumatology** - robust but regulated by Scripture and pastoral prudence.
- **Ecclesial charity** - practical rules for engagement across disputed matters: ask questions, prioritize testimony of Scripture, and preserve fellowship where gospel doctrines are shared.
- **Scriptural authority** - ultimate arbiter for theological dispute and moral guidance.
- **Witness / mission** - public consequence of internal unity; unity enhances credibility in evangelism.
- **Pastoral model** - an applied theology that privileges formation, reconciliation, and disciplined disagreement.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as evangelical essentials and for articulating adoption as core soteriology.
- As a **polemic and pastoral model** against sectarianism in debates over the Baptism of the Holy Spirit and other pneumatological controversies.
- As a **practical exegetical model** for reading Spirit-texts with charity and doctrinal rigor.
