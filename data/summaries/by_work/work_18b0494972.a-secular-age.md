### TITLE
A Secular Age - Charles Taylor

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2007; major intervention in late 20th-early 21st century debates about secularization, influenced by continental and analytic history of ideas, philosophy of religion, and social theory. Addresses Western modernity (primarily North America and Europe) from late medieval to contemporary period.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Explains how Western culture shifted so that theism and belief in transcendence became one credible option among many rather than the default; reframes secularization as a transformation of the conditions of belief rather than merely institutional decline.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Distinguishes three senses of "secularity": decline of religious belief/practice; differentiation of institutions; and the deeper historical formation in which belief in God is one option among others (the book focuses on the third).
 - Reconstructs historical shifts in spiritual experience, selfhood, and intellectual frameworks that produced the modern "immanent frame" - a self-enclosed horizon of meaning where supernatural explanations are bracketed.
 - Tracks psychological and cultural changes: the move from a "porous" to a "buffered" self; the rise of exclusive humanism and the "nova" of religious options; emergence of cross-pressures that make belief and unbelief both plausible.
 - Argues that secular modernity contains both disenchantment (loss of providential world) and new forms of enchantment (therapeutic, expressive, immanent spiritualities).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, Locke, Hume, Kant, Pascal, Rousseau, Marx, Nietzsche, Weber, Durkheim, Habermas; contemporary theologians and philosophers of religion; draws on historiography and sociological theory.
- **Doctrines treated:** Not a systematic theology, but engages doctrinally with:
 - **Revelation** and its epistemic status in changing epistemic frameworks.
 - **Providence and transcendence** (loss and reconfiguration in the immanent frame).
 - **Human nature and sin** insofar as moral sources and yearnings (desire for fullness) are analyzed.
 - **Grace and conversion** conceptually via accounts of spiritual experience and moral transformation.
 - **Ecclesiology and public role of religion** indirectly, via social imaginaries and civic forms.
- **Closing line:** Taylor centers theology on how the modern "immanent frame" recasts human openness to transcendence - making faith a fragile, historically conditioned choice rather than an unquestioned given.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - The **immanent frame** as analytic core: a cultural context that interprets reality within natural, secular terms while leaving open (but not privileging) transcendent meanings.
 - The psychological distinction **porous vs. buffered self** clarifies experiential shifts in vulnerability to the sacred.
 - Focus on **conditions of belief** (historical, cognitive, affective) rather than mere institutional statistics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Corrects simplistic secularization narratives (inevitable decline thesis) by showing plural and contingent pathways; challenges reductionist sociologies (e.g., purely rationalist, Marxist) that ignore interior experience and moral sources.
 - Offers a corrective to purely apologetic or polemical treatments by reconstructing the internal logic of secular modernity.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** "Immanent frame," "buffered/porous self," "exclusive humanism," "nova effect," "cross-pressures," "social imaginary."
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:** 
 - Widely cited across theological traditions for cultural analysis; used by public theologians, systematic and pastoral theologians to rethink proclamation, witness, and formation.
 - Criticized by some theologians for relativizing doctrinal truth-claims or for insufficiently attending to doctrinal content and normative theological judgment.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Provides a durable analytic vocabulary for courses on religion and modernity, public theology, and ecclesial strategy.
 - Provokes rethinking of apologetics, catechesis, and liturgy in light of transformed interior conditions of belief.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent frame:** Cultural horizon that construes the world in naturalistic terms while not logically excluding transcendence; the central analytic tool.
- **Buffered self:** Modern subjectivity that experiences boundaries between self and world, protection from spiritual forces.
- **Porous self:** Pre-modern subjectivity open to spirits, providence, and external moral forces.
- **Conditions of belief:** Historical and psychological circumstances that make belief or unbelief intelligible and available as lived options.
- **Exclusive humanism:** A form of modern secular outlook that grounds meaning wholly within human life without reference to transcendence.
- **Nova effect:** The explosion of religious and spiritual options in modernity producing pluralism and bricolage spirituality.
- **Cross-pressures:** Competing pulls in modern life that make belief and unbelief simultaneously plausible (e.g., scientific rationalism vs. moral longing).
- **Disenchantment:** The progressive loss of a sacred cosmos and providential ordering.
- **Social imaginary:** Shared background frameworks of meaning that make practices and institutions intelligible.
- **Background meanings:** Tacit, pre-theoretical lenses constituting moral and metaphysical understandings.
- **Fullness/Desire for fullness:** Taylor's anthropological motif: human longing that seeks a sense of completeness often construed theologically.
- **Immanence/Transcendence polarity:** Central contrast for interpreting modern religious possibilities.
- **Buffered enchantment:** New forms of spiritual experience within a largely immanent frame (e.g., therapeutic or aesthetic forms).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for a nuanced, non-linear concept of secularization (third sense: conditions of belief).
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in apologetics and public theology: use of "immanent frame" and "cross-pressures" to craft context-sensitive witness.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against simplistic decline narratives and for rethinking ecclesial formation, liturgy, and catechesis in modern contexts.
