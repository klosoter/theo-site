### TITLE
**The Trinity: How Not to Be a Heretic - Robert Letham (Westminster Theological Journal, 2003)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed academic context; response to renewed popular and academic debates about the Trinity (social-trinitarian models, neo-modalism, and sloppy apologetic language).
 - Published in a confessional journal addressing seminarians, pastors, and theologians committed to historic Protestant orthodoxy.

- **Central thesis**
 - To avoid heresy when speaking of God one must retain the classical balance: **absolute unity of God (one ousia) and real distinction of persons (three hypostases)**. Rhetorical clarity and doctrinal precision prevent modalism, tritheism, and other errors.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Brief historical-theological survey showing how errors arise from linguistic and conceptual slippage.
 - Reassertion of Cappadocian categories (ousia/hypostasis, relations of origin) as indispensable tools.
 - Practical corrective to contemporary tendencies:
 - Rejecting "one-person" or imprecise language that collapses persons into modes.
 - Rejecting unguarded social-trinitarian formulations that risk tritheism by treating persons as separate centers of being.
 - Emphasis on the economy (God revealed in history) rightly interpreted by reference to the immanent Trinity, but never inverted (the economic must not dictate the ontology).

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Classical: Athanasius, Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, Augustine.
 - Medieval/reformation: Aquinas, Calvin.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: social Trinitarians, those using "one-person language" (see Van Tils critique), neo-modalists, and some popular evangelical expositions.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (primary), Christology (implications of person-language), revelation (how God is disclosed in history), creedal authority (use of Nicene-Constantinopolitan formulations).

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Orthodoxy consists in disciplined speech about God: keep "one God" and "three persons" together by classical categories, avoiding linguistic shortcuts that produce heresy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Pastoral-polemical clarity: Letham insists on the practical consequences of imprecise language for preaching, devotion, and doctrine.
 - History-of-doctrine as corrective: uses patristic and Reformed resources to steady modern debate.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contra modalism: warns against any language that treats Father, Son, Spirit as successive masks or modes.
 - Contra social trinitarian drift: resists reducing the Trinity to a social model of three autonomous centers (which risks tritheism).
 - Contra economic reductionism: refuses to let redemptive history alone define inner relations of the Godhead.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - No radical neologisms; rather a disciplined reapplication of classical terms (hypostasis, ousia, relations of origin, appropriation) to contemporary confusions.
 - Sharp articulation of how *one-person language* (as critiqued by Van Tils) functions as a fault-line in modern treatments.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles as a concise corrective and teaching aid.
 - Cited in seminary classrooms when surveying orthodox responses to social trinitarian and modalist tendencies.
 - Less influential in circles already committed to social-trinitarian paradigms, but respected as a careful historical-theological defense.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, compact manual for avoiding heresy in speech and teaching about the Trinity.
 - Effective bridge between patristic formulations and contemporary polemics; useful for pastors and advanced students.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ousia (essence)** - The one divine substance shared by Father, Son, and Spirit; the ground of divine unity.
- **Hypostasis (person)** - The three real, distinct centers of personal reality within the one God; prevents collapse into modalism.
- **Relations of origin** - The intra-Trinitarian relations (begetting, procession) that distinguish persons without dividing essence.
- **Economic Trinity** - God as He acts in history (revelation, redemption); must be interpreted by reference to the immanent Trinity.
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as He is in Himself (ontological relations and distinctions); governs correct theological inference from economy.
- **Appropriation (theological usage)** - Legitimate ascription of certain works to particular persons (e.g., Son = redemption) without implying ontological isolation.
- **Perichoresis** - Mutual indwelling of persons; preserves unity and genuine relationality without fusion or confusion.
- **Modalism** - Error that the divine persons are mere modes of one person; Letham shows how imprecise language fosters this.
- **Tritheism** - Error of treating persons as three separate gods; opposed by insistence on one ousia.
- **Social trinitarianism** - Contemporary model emphasizing personhood and relations; Letham warns it can slide into tritheism if unguarded.
- **One-person language (Van Tils critique)** - Phrase marking modern misuse where language collapses persons into a single center; Letham uses Van Tils' critique to illustrate dangers.
- **Creedal language (Nicene-Constantinopolitan)** - Standard corrective vocabulary; Letham appeals to creeds as normative grammar for Trinitarian speech.
- **Heresy** - Not merely error but doctrinal deformation that arises from linguistic and conceptual slippage; avoided by disciplined use of classical categories.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for seminary lectures on orthodox Trinitarian grammar.
 - As a **polemic** and pastoral corrective against modalism and unguarded social-trinitarian formulations.
 - As an **exegetical model** urging careful alignment of biblical economy with creedal-immanent categories.
