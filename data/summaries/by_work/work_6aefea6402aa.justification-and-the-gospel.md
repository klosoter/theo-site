### TITLE
Justification and the Gospel - Michael Allen 
Contemporary Reformed theological defense of forensic justification; engagement with New Perspective on Paul, Roman Catholic ecumenical moves, and pastoral implications for assurance and proclamation.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed response to renewed scholarly and ecumenical debates about justification (post-New Perspective surge, Joint Declaration era, N. T. Wright, Dunn, Sanders).
 - Moves within Reformed and evangelical seminaries to restate classical formulations against perceived dilution by historical-critical reinterpretation and Roman Catholic proposals.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The gospel is essentially the declaration of sinners righteous in Christ; **justification as forensic declaration (imputation)** is normative and indispensable to Christian doctrine, worship, and assurance.
 - Problem addressed: whether Pauline righteousness language primarily denotes covenant membership/faithfulness (NPP) or forensic acquittal and imputed righteousness upheld by classical Protestantism.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical groundwork: careful reading of Paul (Romans, Galatians) to show patterns of forensic language and imputed righteousness tied to Christ's obedience.
 - Systematic retrieval: situates justification within covenant, Christology (active/passive obedience), Trinitarian divine agency, and soteriological coherence.
 - Polemical engagement: critiques New Perspective readings that relativize forensic elements; answers Roman Catholic/Joint Declaration emphases on infusion, merit, or cooperation.
 - Pastoral application: links justification to assurance, worship, evangelism, and the church's proclamation of the gospel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Paul (esp. Romans, Galatians); patristic and Reformational sources (Augustine, Luther, Calvin); modern interlocutors (N. T. Wright, James Dunn, E. P. Sanders).
 - Secondary: contemporary Reformed defenders (Murray, Horton, Gaffin) and ecumenical documents.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification, imputation (active and passive obedience), union with Christ, righteousness of God, faith vs. faithfulness debates, sanctification, covenant theology, atonement, assurance, law-gospel distinction, ecclesiology as proclamation.
- **Closing line**
 - Allen insists that **forensic imputed righteousness in union with Christ is the gospel's center**, necessary for true assurance, faithful worship, and missionary clarity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust defense of **forensic imputation** while integrating it with a real relational union with Christ - avoids reduction to mere legal fiction or to purely relational/covenantal categories.
 - Stresses both **active and passive obedience** of Christ as the ground for imputation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects New Perspective tendencies that read Paul primarily in covenantal/ethnic terms by recovering the sustained forensic and forensic-covenantal syntax in Pauline texts.
 - Opposes Roman Catholic/Joint Declaration moves toward infusion, merit, or cooperative righteousness, arguing they erode gospel solus (grace alone, faith alone).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced framing of **"gospel" as divine declarative act** - not merely announcement of facts or covenant membership, but a judicial pronouncement grounded in Christ's obedience and imputed righteousness.
 - Emphasizes **doctrinal economy**: how justification functions as the hinge between Christology, covenant, and soteriology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Adopted in Reformed seminaries and conservative evangelical settings as a clear, usable synthesis defending classical justification.
 - Cited in debates over the shape of Pauline theology and in critiques of ecumenical compromises.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful model for integrating exegetical rigor, doctrinal fidelity, and pastoral concern; serves as a teaching text for systematic and pastoral theology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification** - God's declarative act pronouncing sinners righteous in Christ; forensic and covenantally grounded.
- **Imputation** - The forensic transfer: Christ's righteousness credited to believers; often set as **double imputation** (our sin to Christ, his righteousness to us).
- **Forensic / Declarative** - Legal character of justification; central analytic category for Allen's argument.
- **Union with Christ** - Ontological participation that undergirds imputation; not opposed to forensic declaration but its relational ground.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's perfect life (active) and his atoning suffering/death (passive) together constitute the basis for righteousness imputed to believers.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - Skeptical reading of Paul emphasizing covenant membership/ethnic boundary markers; primary interlocutor Allen critiques.
- **Infusion / Merit** - Roman Catholic concepts critiqued as incompatible with gospel declarative justification.
- **Righteousness of God** - Pauline theme read as both God's covenant faithfulness and the righteousness Christ secures and which is reckoned to believers.
- **Faith vs. Faithfulness** - Distinction addressed: faith as trust in Christ is instrument of justification; faithfulness-of-Christ position engaged but not allowed to displace imputation.
- **Law/Gospel distinction** - Reaffirmed: law demands; gospel declares fulfillment in Christ and grants righteousness.
- **Assurance** - Pastoral corollary: forensic imputation secures believers' certainty before God.
- **Covenant theology** - Provides structural frame uniting forensic, relational, and historical promises of God.
- **Atonement** - Tied to both active/passive obedience as ground for declaration.
- **Gospel (defined)** - The public, divine verdict that sinners are righteous in Christ; primary content for proclamation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definitional source** for conservative Reformed formulations of justification and imputation.
 - As a **polemic** against New Perspective and Roman Catholic-revisionist readings of Pauline soteriology.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline righteousness language within a forensic-covenantal framework.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking justification, assurance, and pastoral proclamation in preaching and catechesis.
