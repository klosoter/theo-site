### TITLE
**Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought**
John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed apologetics and presuppositionalism; response to modernism, neo-orthodoxy (esp. Barth), and Roman Catholic Thomism.
 - Frame writes as a student and interlocutor of Van Til, placing Van Til within 20th-century Princeton/Reformed streams and engaging contemporary epistemological debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Van Til insists that all knowledge and apologetic warrant are fundamentally rooted in the self-revelation of the triune God; epistemology is theological at the outset.
 - The work addresses how divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) and the Trinity shape doctrine of knowledge and apologetic method.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: autonomous human reason presupposes idolatrous self-sufficiency; modern and some Christian responses (analogia entis) fail to account for radical Creator-creature distinction.
 - Reconstruction: knowledge presupposes God's self-disclosure; human thinking must be tested by divine revelation (presuppositional method).
 - Application: critique of one-person language for the Trinity, engagement with Barth (Rahner's Rule reformulated), and defense against analogia entis.
 - Methodological claim: theology as a principled science - coherent, deductive system grounded in Scripture and the covenantal God.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Barth (and Barth's use of Karl Rahner's rule), Karl Rahner indirectly, Thomists (analogia entis), British empiricists, and Reformed confessional sources (Westminster Standards).
 - Dialogues with contemporaries in apologetics (e.g., Gordon H. Clark) and earlier Reformed theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and epistemology; theology proper (attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility); Trinity; implications for bibliology and apologetics; limited references to Christology as mediator of knowledge.
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til's theological center of gravity: **the sovereignty and self-disclosure of the triune God is the constitutive ground of intelligibility, epistemic warrant, and apologetic practice**.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Radical theocentrism: epistemology begins and must remain within God's self-revelation; no neutral ground between Christian and non-Christian thought.
 - Covenantal and Trinitarian framing of knowledge: God's triune action is epistemic and moral, not merely ontic.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against analogia entis: rejects a natural analogy that locates points of contact independent of revelation.
 - Against certain readings of Barth and Rahner: affirms Barthian priority of revelation but insists on Van Til's stricter epistemic presuppositions and clearer polemic against natural theology.
 - Diverges from evidentialist apologetics and from Gordon Clark's rationalism by emphasizing the necessity of revelation over pure logical demonstration.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Presuppositional apologetics" articulated as a coherent method: critiquing unbelief by exposing inconsistent presuppositions and offering a scriptural presupposition.
 - Use of epistemic antithesis: a pervasive, fundamental opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong influence in Reformed and Presbyterian apologetics and seminary pedagogy; polarizing in broader evangelicalism.
 - Stimulated debates on methodology, pluralism, and the relation of reason and revelation; influenced later theologians (including Frame) and contemporary presuppositionalists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Forces theological epistemology to account for divine attributes and Trinitarian revelation; remains a rigorous polemical tool and a provocative corrective to secular epistemologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism**
 - Method that begins with theological commitments (Scripture) and tests others for internal coherence.
- **Epistemic antithesis**
 - The basic, world-shaping opposition between believers and unbelievers in fundamental presuppositions.
- **Principia: theology as science**
 - Theology presented as a principled, systematic science grounded in first principles (God's self-revelation).
- **Analogia entis**
 - The doctrine of a real analogy between God and creatures; Van Til rejects as giving ground to autonomous reason.
 - Contrast: **analogia fidei** (analogy of faith) preferred - God's self-disclosure shapes analogy.
- **Rahner's Rule / Barth's reformulation**
 - Rahner's rule: presuppose the interpretation that most accords with authorial intent; Barth's reformulation invoked to preserve revelation as determinative - Frame discusses Van Til's critical use of these rules.
- **One-person language (Van Til)**
 - Van Til's cautious language about intra-Trinitarian relations; Frame critiques/clarifies Van Til's one-person tendencies and the risk of modalism or subordinationist misunderstandings.
- **Divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility**
 - Attributes invoked to secure Creator-creature distinction and to ground knowability; used to critique notions of God as changeable or experientially derived.
- **Existence and knowability of God**
 - God's existence is presupposed and made known through revelation; knowability depends on God's communicative action, not creaturely demonstration.
- **Theological method vs. apologetic technique**
 - Distinguishes systematic grounding (theology) from rhetorical or evidential tactics (apologetics).
- **Covenant epistemology**
 - Knowledge structured by covenantal relation between God and covenant people, shaping interpretation and assent.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: authoritative articulation of presuppositional method and covenantal epistemology.
 - Polemic: primary weapon against natural theology, evidentialism, and analogia entis.
 - Conceptual pivot: models integration of theological attributes with epistemology and apologetic practice.
