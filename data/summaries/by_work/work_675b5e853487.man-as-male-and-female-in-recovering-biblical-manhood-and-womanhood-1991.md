### TITLE
Man as Male and Female - Wayne Grudem (chapter in Recovering Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, 1991)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1990s conservative evangelical response to rising egalitarian scholarship; produced under the aegis of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW). Situated within broader Reformed-evangelical debate over gender roles in church and home.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture teaches that men and women are equal in value and dignity yet appointed to complementary, distinct roles (male headship and female submission) grounded in creation order and affirmed in redemptive-historical teaching.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Genesis 1-2: creation order and the intentionality of male and female as constitutive for roles.
 - Biblical-theological reinforcement from Pauline texts (1 Corinthians 11; 1 Timothy 2) - Paul interpreted as endorsing male leadership in worship and pastoral office.
 - Ontological equality vs. functional distinction: insistence that role differences do not imply ontological inferiority.
 - Practical implications for marriage, family, and church polity; pastoral and ecclesial prescriptions follow from theological commitments.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary interlocutors: contemporary egalitarian scholars and feminist interpreters (implicit targets: those who read Paul and Genesis as collapsing role distinctions).
 - Traditional sources: canonical exegesis, patristic and Reformation echoes; draws on systematic-theological categories common to conservative Protestants.
- **Doctrines treated:** Biblical authority and hermeneutics, anthropology (image of God), sin and fall, marriage and covenantal roles, church order, pastoral ministry.
- **Closing line:** A systematic, biblically-rooted defense of complementarian role distinctions that locates male headship in creation order while affirming equal human dignity under the imago Dei.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Careful delimitation of **ontological equality** versus **functional distinction**; persistent clarity that role difference is not ontological diminution.
 - Use of creation order as foundational for normative practice rather than merely descriptive anthropology.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against egalitarian readings that treat cultural contingency or Sin-affected texts as primary; reasserts plain reading of Genesis and Pauline directives as normative.
 - Contrasts with feminist and some progressive Reformed readings that emphasize role fluidity or egalitarian church leadership.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematizing complementarianism within a broader evangelical systematic framework - integrating exegesis, ethics, and ecclesiology.
 - Clarifies functional categories (e.g., "headship" as responsibility/authority) while attempting to ward off caricature of authoritarianism.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential within conservative evangelical and Reformed circles; chapter and volume became standard resources for CBMW-aligned teaching, pastoral training, and church polity debates.
 - Criticized by egalitarian scholars for selective exegesis, cultural insensitivity, and underestimation of historical-cultural conditioning in Pauline instructions.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise, accessible model of how to construct a systematic complementarian argument from Scriptures.
 - Useful as a representative primary-source for understanding the 1990s complementarian movement and its rhetorical strategies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Complementarianism:** The view that men and women are equal in worth but have distinct, complementary roles in church and family.
- **Egalitarianism:** Counter-position arguing for role interchangeability in ministry and home based on equality and gifting.
- **Creation order argument:** The claim that Genesis 1-2 supplies normative ordering for gender roles; Grudem uses this as primary warrant for male headship.
- **Functional vs. ontological distinction:** Key hermeneutical move - same personhood/dignity but different responsibilities and authorities.
- **Headship (kephale):** Interpreted as leadership/authority responsibility (not necessarily unilateral domination); central to Grudem's exegesis of Pauline texts.
- **Imago Dei:** Basis for equal dignity; used to affirm equality while permitting role distinctions.
- **Hermeneutics of affirmation:** Method that reads Old and New Testament texts in continuity on gender role questions rather than privileging cultural readings.
- **1 Corinthians 11 / 1 Timothy 2:** Primary Pauline texts appealed to for arguments about worship order, public teaching, and pastoral leadership.
- **Genesis 1-2:** Primary creation texts; Grudem emphasizes order of creation and "helper" language as role-defining.
- **Authority and submission:** Operational terms - male authority in family/church paired with female willingness to submit in specified contexts.
- **Dichotomy vs Trichotomy (anthropology):** Grudem endorses **dichotomy** (body + immaterial soul/spirit) and rejects a trichotomous split; anthropological view undergirds his pastoral and ecclesial claims.
- **Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood (CBMW):** Institutional locus for the volume: platform for promulgating complementarian positions.
- **Role distinctions (binary):** Emphasis on male/female as binary and complementary categories for ecclesial and familial ordering.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for conservative complementarian doctrine in seminaries and churches.
 - As a **polemic** against egalitarian readings in debates about ordination and pastoral practice.
 - As an **exegetical model** demonstrating how to connect Genesis and Pauline materials to ecclesial policy.
