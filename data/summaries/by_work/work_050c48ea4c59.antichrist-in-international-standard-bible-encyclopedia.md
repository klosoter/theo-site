### TITLE
Antichrist. B. B. Warfield. Entry in International Standard Bible Encyclopedia (ISBE). Concise exegetical-theological survey of the New Testament concept of Antichrist and its relation to the "man of lawlessness."

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton Reformed theology; ISBE entry written by B. B. Warfield, a leading conservative exegete reacting to both speculative popular eschatologies and liberal critical trends.
 - Aimed at a learned Protestant readership seeking sober biblical and historical orientation on Antichrist motifs.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To define the biblical doctrine of Antichrist: its scriptural character, relation between Johannine "antichrist(s)" and Pauline "man of lawlessness," and the interplay of typological/recurring evil with a final eschatological antagonist.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical survey:
 - Johannine corpus (1 John 2:18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7) presents Antichrist primarily as a spirit and as plural "antichrists" already at work-false teachers denying the incarnate Christ.
 - Pauline passage (2 Thess 2:1-12) focuses on a coming "man of lawlessness" who will oppose and exalt himself above God; this figure is presented as an eschatological person whose coming is restrained until God's appointed time.
 - Apocalyptic texts (Daniel's little horn, Revelation's beasts) provide Old Testament and prophetic background for a final adversary.
 - Theological synthesis:
 - Warfield argues for a dual aspect: Antichrist as a recurring spirit of opposition to Christ in history and yet culminating in a final personal manifestation.
 - He rejects overly narrow identifications (e.g., tying Antichrist exclusively to a past historical figure) while avoiding purely symbolic readings that evacuate eschatological expectation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scriptural witnesses: 1 John, 2 John, 2 Thessalonians, Daniel, Revelation.
 - Patristic and medieval reception surveyed (Church Fathers, later Reformers).
 - Engages popular and scholarly positions: premillennial/dispensational speculators, historicist identifications (e.g., papal-antichrist), and some critical scholarship.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (incarnation as the key test for true belief vs. antichrist denial).
 - Eschatology (parousia, final apostasy, and final adversary).
 - Ecclesiology and revelation (markers of the true church vs. false teachers).

- **Closing line**
 - Warfield centers the discussion on the Christological test: Antichrist is primarily defined by opposition to the incarnate Christ, appearing historically in spirit and finally in person, and serving as both doctrinal warning and eschatological sign.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Balanced insistence on both **present spiritual reality** of antichristian deception and the **future personal manifestation** (man of lawlessness) - avoids exclusive historicist or purely symbolic reductions.
 - Strong Christological criterion: denial of the incarnation is the defining mark of antichristian error.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Critiques speculative identifications that equate Antichrist solely with one historical institution or individual (e.g., simplistic papal-antichrist claims or exclusive Nero-identifications).
 - Pushes back on liberal critical tendencies that explain Antichrist solely as a literary or sociological phenomenon without eschatological import.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clear distinction between **"spirit of antichrist"** (recurring phenomenon) and **"man of lawlessness"** (eschatological person) while arguing for their theological continuity.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in conservative Reformed circles as a measured, scholarly resource; often cited in surveys combating sensationalist eschatologies.
 - Influenced 20th-century conservative treatments of New Testament eschatology and polemics against speculative identifications.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, sober exegetical-theological template for teaching Antichrist motifs: scriptural grounding, historical awareness, and theological balance.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Antichrist**
 - General New Testament label for those opposing or substituting themselves for Christ; used both collectively and in reference to a climaxing person.
- **Spirit of antichrist**
 - Ongoing doctrinal/spiritual opposition to Christ, already present in the church era (Johannine emphasis).
- **Antichrists (plural)**
 - False teachers denying the incarnation and undermining apostolic witness (1 John).
- **Man of lawlessness (anthropos aselgeias)**
 - Pauline eschatological figure in 2 Thess 2; final personal opponent exhibiting lawless self-exaltation.
- **Parousia**
 - Christ's coming; in Warfield's account, the decisive horizon by which Antichrist's career is judged and ended.
- **Lawlessness (anomia)**
 - The ethical/theological antonym to covenantal order; central characteristic of the man of lawlessness.
- **Incarnation test**
 - Warfield's hermeneutical key: affirmation/denial of Christ's incarnation distinguishes orthodoxy from antichristian error.
- **Danielic/Apocalyptic background**
 - Daniel's "little horn" and Revelation's beasts provide typological and prophetic motifs for Antichrist's portrayal.
- **Historicist vs. Preterist vs. Futurist**
 - Survey of interpretive schemes; Warfield favors a tempered synthesis avoiding the extremes of each.
- **Papacy debate**
 - Historical polemic wherein some have identified the papacy as Antichrist; Warfield treats such identifications critically and contextually.
- **False Christ / Pseudo-Christ**
 - Related terms for deceptive messianic claims; Warfield emphasizes doctrinal content rather than purely political markers.
- **Eschatological deception**
 - Theological theme: deception is both present (teachers) and future (powerful delusion on those who refuse truth).

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: concise, conservative delineation of Antichrist motifs for systematic theology and catechesis.
 - As a **polemic resource**: tempering sensationalist or sectarian Antichrist claims while providing ammunition for measured critique.
 - As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates linking Johannine and Pauline corpora to form a theologically coherent picture of Antichrist for eschatology and Christology.
