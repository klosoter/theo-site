### TITLE
Jesus, Paul and the End of the World - Ben Witherington III

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical New Testament scholarship; engages late 20th-early 21st century debates about Jesus' and Paul's eschatology.
 - Responds to trends: Schweitzerian imminence thesis, "realized" vs "future" eschatology debates, and critics who separate Jesus' apocalypticism from Pauline theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Jesus and Paul share an **apocalyptic, inaugurated eschatology**: God's final intervention has begun in Jesus (especially in the resurrection) and is being worked out in the present church while still awaiting consummation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis of the Jewish apocalyptic matrix of Jesus' teaching: Kingdom language, imminent expectation, dual-age worldview.
 - Exposition of Jesus' sayings and deeds as announcing an imminent inbreaking of God's reign.
 - Analysis of Paul's theology as continuous with Jesus: Paul reinterprets imminence in light of the resurrection, locating believers "in Christ" as participants in the new age.
 - Application: ethical, ecclesiological and missional consequences of an inaugurated-but-not-yet eschatology; handling of delayed parousia.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Schweitzer, E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright, C. H. Dodd, and classical redaction/critical scholars.
 - Primary sources: Synoptic Gospels, Pauline corpus; Jewish apocalyptic literature and Second Temple context (Dead Sea Scrolls, intertestamental writings).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (imminence, parousia), Christology (resurrection as decisive), soteriology (participation in Christ), kingdom of God, new creation, covenant renewal, ecclesiology, ethical imperative.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **the end has been inaugurated in Christ - the resurrection secures the new age while calling the church to live as citizens of a present-but-future kingdom.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong methodological insistence on continuity between Jesus and Paul rather than radical discontinuity; reads Paul as an interpreter of Jesus' apocalyptic message within missionary circumstances.
 - Stresses the **socio-rhetorical and ethical** consequences of eschatology (how belief shapes community life).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against views that either (a) privatize or spiritualize Jesus' eschatology into mere ethical teaching (extreme realized eschatology), or (b) detach Paul from Jesus and render Paul purely Hellenistic or theological.
 - Revises Schweitzer's notion of a "failed" eschatological expectation by arguing resurrection reinterprets and validates Jesus' proclamation.
- **Conceptual or terminological notes**
 - Employs **inaugurated eschatology** as the decisive frame: not simply "already" nor simply "not yet," but a dynamic overlap of ages initiated by Christ's death and resurrection.
 - Emphasizes Pauline categories (present evil age / age to come; in Christ; parousia) as apocalyptic instruments, not abstract metaphysics.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in evangelical and mainstream academic circles for accessible synthesis of Jesus-and-Paul continuity; often cited in studies on Pauline apocalypticism.
 - Less influential among scholars who advocate more radical discontinuity or sociological reconstructions that downplay apocalyptic motifs.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the theological and pastoral stakes of eschatology for ethics and mission.
 - Serves as a readable, exegetically informed bridge between historical Jesus studies and Pauline theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apocalyptic** - worldview of imminent divine intervention; lenses for reading Jesus and Paul.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - the end has begun in Christ (especially resurrection) but awaits consummation.
- **Imminence** - expectation that God's action is near; reinterpreted, not abandoned, after the resurrection.
- **Parousia** - Christ's coming; treated as promised consummation that structures hope and ethical urgency.
- **Kingdom of God** - Jesus' central proclamation; both present reality and future consummation.
- **New age / present evil age** - apocalyptic dual-age schema used by Paul to frame salvation history.
- **In Christ / participation** - Pauline soteriology: believers already share in Christ's victory as inhabitants of the inaugurated new age.
- **Resurrection** - decisive event that reconfigures expectation; grounds hope and justifies mission.
- **Delay of the parousia** - pastoral-theological problem handled by interpreting present ministry and suffering within inaugurated eschatology.
- **Ethical eschatology** - how eschatological belief shapes community ethics and mission.
- **Covenant / new creation** - language used to connect Jesus/Paul to Israel's promises and cosmic renewal.
- **Temple imagery / presence of God** - used to describe how God's presence is localized in Christ and the church pending final restoration.
- **Continuity model** - Witherington's default interpretive posture: Jesus -> Paul continuity in apocalyptic thrust.
- **Contrast with realized/futurist extremes** - work commonly cited to argue against both extremes; offers balanced middle ground.
- **Exegetical model** - close literary and socio-historical exegesis combining Gospel and Pauline texts to reconstruct coherent early Christian eschatology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Jesus and Paul together on eschatology.
- As a **polemic** against dispensational futurism and against extreme realized eschatology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on Pauline apocalypticism and pastoral theology addressing parousia delay.
