### TITLE
A Discourse Concerning Liturgies, and Their Imposition - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-17th century England; English Civil War/Interregnum/Restoration controversies over the Book of Common Prayer and episcopal imposition. Owen writes as a Reformed Congregational (Puritan) theologian reacting to Anglican ceremonialism, episcopal authority, and post-Restoration enforcement of uniformity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Imposed, prescriptive liturgies (forms and ceremonies enforced by civil or ecclesiastical authority) are unlawful and destructive: true public worship must be regulated only by Scripture and offered in spiritual freedom; ceremonial imposition violates the conscience and purity of the church.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Ground worship authority in Scripture; draw a boundary between what Scripture prescribes (obligatory) and what is indifferent (circumstantial).
 - Deny any divine warrant for humanly devised, prescribed forms when imposed on conscience; such imposition is tyrannical and ecclesiastically illicit.
 - Treat ceremonies and prescribed language as adiaphora (non-essentials) that may be permitted by liberty but never imposed as law.
 - Apply these principles to sacramental practice: defend Reformed sacramental theology (sign and seal) while resisting prescribed liturgical rites for baptism and the Lord's Supper.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Anglican High Church party (Laud, bishops enforcing the Prayer Book), the Book of Common Prayer itself, and broader debates with Presbyterians and Latitudinarians; Owen also appeals to Scripture, early church practice, and Reformed confessions/principles.
- **Doctrines treated:** ecclesiology, worship theory (regulative principle), authority and conscience, sacramentology (baptism and the Lord's Supper), covenant theology implications for worship and baptism.
- **Closing line capturing theological center:** Worship must be shaped by Scripture and offered freely; humanly imposed liturgies corrupt the church by substituting imposed forms for evangelical liberty and covenantal sign-usage.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong affirmation of liberty of conscience in the form and expression of public worship, constrained only by Scripture.
 - Clear application of the regulative principle: only what Scripture prescribes or warrants may be imposed.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Direct corrective to Anglican claims that episcopal authority or common prayer can lawfully determine public worship; Owen argues against legal imposition regardless of historical continuity.
 - Contrasts with some Puritan compromises that accepted prescribed forms for order; Owen insists on voluntary, scripturally warranted forms.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Precise operationalization of the adiaphora principle in worship: distinguishing lawful liberty from unlawful imposition.
 - Tight linking of sacramental efficacy (sign and seal) with covenantal promise and individual faith, not with ceremonial perfection or mandatory form.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential among Congregationalists and many Presbyterians; used by dissenting Protestants as a defense of nonconformity and religious liberty.
 - Less persuasive to High Church Anglicans; of lasting influence in Reformed discussions of the regulative principle and ecclesiastical polity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A primary Reformed source for arguing against liturgical imposition and for worship liberty; useful for tracing the theological roots of dissent and the polity-liberty nexus.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Liturgy:** a prescribed form of public worship; Owen critiques its imposition while allowing voluntary use when Scripture or church liberty allows.
- **Imposition:** authoritative enforcement of rites/forms; Owen treats imposition as the moral and ecclesiastical wrong, not necessarily the content of a rite.
- **Regulative principle of worship:** the rule that only what Scripture prescribes is to be commanded in worship; central justificatory principle in Owen's argument.
- **Adiaphora:** matters indifferent to salvation; Owen applies this to ceremonies but forbids their coercive enforcement.
- **Sacrament:** visible sign and seal of the covenant (baptism, Lord's Supper); Owen insists on covenantal and spiritual realities over ceremonial formality.
- **Sign and seal:** Owen's language for sacramental function - baptism signifies and seals covenant promises but does not automatically effect regeneration.
- **Baptism (general):** a covenantal sign and seal; to be administered according to Scripture, not by imposed rites.
 - **Infant baptism:** defended as a legitimate covenant sign for covenant children consistent with Reformed covenant theology; its presence in worship is acceptable but not to be rigidly imposed in ceremonial fashion.
 - **Believers' baptism:** acknowledged as reflecting personal faith; Owen distinguishes the *meaning* and *efficacy* of baptism from the question of whether a particular mode or rite is imposed.
- **Mode (immersion vs affusion):** treated as non-essential; Owen places mode under adiaphora and argues efficacy does not hinge on immersion specifically.
- **Efficacy:** sacramental efficacy depends on covenant promise and faith, not on imposed liturgical formulae or specific ceremonial mode.
- **Ecclesiastical authority:** criticized when exercised to enforce non-scriptural rites; legitimate authority must conform to Scripture and respect conscience.
- **Conscience/liberty:** central ethical category - imposition violates conscientious worship and the spiritual nature of true worship.
- **Covenant of grace:** framework for understanding infant inclusion in baptism; Owen ties sacramental practice to covenantal promise rather than ritual necessity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional source for the Reformed/regulative understanding of worship and liturgy.
 - As a polemic text against imposed ceremonialism and for dissenting liberty of conscience.
 - As an exegetical and conceptual model for sacramental theology emphasizing sign/seal, covenant inclusion of infants, and the non-essential nature of mode.
