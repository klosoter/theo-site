### TITLE
The Shaking of the Foundations (Paul Tillich, 1948; sermons from the 1930s-1940s)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Sermon collection delivered in Germany and the U.S. (Union Theological Seminary, NY) amid crisis: rise of fascism, world war, exile.
 - Milieu: Protestant neo-orthodoxy interacting with existentialism and phenomenology; pastoral response to cultural disintegration.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical Word, rightly proclaimed, **shakes human and cultural foundations** (judgment), discloses God as the **ground of being**, and creates participation in the **New Being** (grace) that overcomes estrangement.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Existential diagnosis: anxiety, guilt, meaning-loss, and the **demonic** distortions of culture reveal the **ambiguity** of finitude.
 - Prophetic and christological proclamation: the **kerygma** exposes idolatrous foundations and announces **acceptance of the unacceptable** in Christ.
 - Ontological depth: God is not a being among beings but **Being-itself**, encountered in the **depth-dimension** of reality.
 - Transformative participation: the **Spirit** actualizes the New Being, renewing persons and communities in a **kairos** of decision and hope.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Biblical prophets, Paul, and Gospel traditions as primary voices for judgment and grace.
 - Luther and Augustine (sin, grace); Kierkegaard (decision, paradox); Heidegger (existential analysis); Bultmann (existential exegesis); in contrast and partial dialogue with Barth (revelation).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theology Proper (ground of being, ultimate concern); revelation as symbol and kerygma; sin as estrangement; justification as acceptance; Christology as New Being; pneumatology as power of renewal; eschatology as judgment and kairos; church as witness within history's ambiguity.
- **Closing line**
 - The work centers on the **event of New Being** in Christ that judges idols, heals estrangement, and opens history to God's inbreaking.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **God beyond theism**: Being-itself, not a highest object.
 - **Sin as estrangement** (from self, others, God), rather than primarily legal guilt.
 - **Grace as acceptance** that precedes and grounds moral transformation.
 - **Christ as New Being**: the decisive manifestation of reconciliation within history.
 - **Symbol and myth** as bearers of truth that participate in what they signify.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against literalism and moralism: insists on symbolic depth and existential address.
 - Against liberal optimism: highlights radical judgment and the demonic in culture.
 - Against revelational positivism: proposes correlation of human questions with the Word's answers.
 - Against anthropomorphic theism: critiques idolatry of finite ultimates.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Ground/Being-itself; **ultimate concern**; **depth** or vertical dimension; **ambiguity** and the **demonic**; **kairos**; **method of correlation**; **acceptance of the unacceptable**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in homiletics and pastoral theology; a paradigm for preaching to modern anxieties.
 - Reformed reception mixed: valued for prophetic critique of idolatry and strong doctrine of sin and grace; questioned for metaphysical framing, thin Trinitarian specification, and an existentialist Christology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable lexicon and sermon method for speaking gospel to crisis-laden contexts.
 - Offers a bridge between biblical proclamation and contemporary self-understanding.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Shaking of the foundations**: apocalyptic-prophetic judgment that unveils false securities and calls to repentance and hope.
- **Ground of being / Being-itself**: God as the ontological depth enabling all existence; resists treating God as one being.
 - Contrast: theistic personalism's highest being vs. Tillich's trans-categorical Ground.
- **Ultimate concern**: that which claims our total devotion; criterion for detecting idolatry and authentic faith.
- **Depth (vertical) dimension**: the interior-transcendent axis of meaning beneath everyday surface concerns.
- **Estrangement**: existential condition of separation from God, self, others; Tillich's master-term for sin.
- **Ambiguity**: inescapable mixture of creativity and self-destruction in culture and person.
- **The demonic**: finite structures absolutized, turning creative powers into enslaving forces.
- **New Being**: Christological reality reconciling estrangement; the center of Tillich's soteriology and Christology.
- **Acceptance of the unacceptable**: experiential definition of justification by grace; pastoral entry point to faith.
- **Kairos**: a decisive moment of God's time breaking into historical time, demanding decision.
- **Symbol / myth**: linguistic forms that participate in the reality they signify; non-literal yet truth-bearing.
- **Correlation (method of)**: theological procedure aligning existential questions with revelatory answers without collapsing either.
- **Spirit as power of renewal**: the dynamic presence actualizing participation in the New Being and forming community.
- **Judgment and hope**: inseparable poles; judgment unmasks idols, hope grounds courage to be renewed.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Theology Proper: source for defining God as ground of being and critiquing idolatrous theism.
 - Doctrine of Sin and Soteriology: classic statements on estrangement and justification as acceptance.
 - Christology and Pneumatology: Christ as New Being; Spirit as transformative power.
 - Eschatology and homiletics: model of prophetic-apocalyptic preaching oriented to kairos and cultural critique.
