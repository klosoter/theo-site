### TITLE
Response to Kline and Horton - Stephen Wellum (in Progressive Covenantalism, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-2010s Reformed/evangelical debate over covenant theology. Located within the edited volume "Progressive Covenantalism" as a corrective and constructive contribution to contemporary covenantal debates that engage both classic federalism and more recent Klinean/new federalist revisions.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to critique the Klinean notion of "intrusion ethics" and related emphases, while also responding to Horton-style defenses of classic federal theology, proposing instead a calibrated Progressive Covenantalist account that preserves covenant continuity without capitulating to intrusive moral relativism or anachronistic readings of divine commands.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnose Kline's intrusion ethics: claims that many Mosaic commands function as redemptive-historical "intrusions" (situational, non-normative directives administered by Yahweh in Israel's covenantal role).
 - Show theological and hermeneutical problems with treating large swathes of the Mosaic law as non-normative for Christian ethics (risks of relativism, exegetical instability, neglect of moral law continuity).
 - Respond to Horton: acknowledge the value of federal categories but critique insufficient sensitivity to redemptive-historical progression and to the distinction between covenant form and substance.
 - Offer Progressive Covenantalist alternative: maintain a historical unfolding (progression) of covenant revelation, affirm continuity of the moral character of God and the principled bindingness of moral norms, while recognizing administrations and typological modifications across covenants.
 - Apply to moral-exegetical practice: propose principles for discerning which Mosaic elements are abiding moral norms, which are covenantal-administrative, and which are redemptive-historical typifications fulfilled in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Meredith G. Kline (intrusion ethics and covenantal structure), Michael Horton (classic federalist interlocutor), Scripture (covenant texts - Adamic, Noahic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant), broader Reformed theologians implicitly engaged.
- **Doctrines treated:** covenant theology (covenant of works, covenant of grace), law and ethics (moral law, ceremonial/administrative law), revelation and progressive revelation, Christology (fulfillment and typology), ecclesiology indirectly (covenant community status).
- **Closing line:** argues for a Progressive Covenantalist middle path that secures the normative continuity of God's moral will while properly locating Mosaic particularities within the unfolding, typological economy culminating in Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Emphasizes *progressive* covenant unfolding as hermeneutical grid rather than static typology or wholesale abstraction of norms.
 - Stresses the **normative continuity of God's moral character** so moral norms are not simply historical "intrusions."
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - To Kline: rejects an overly strong intrusion model that renders many OT commands non-normative and threatens ethical relativism.
 - To Horton/classic federalism: critiques insufficient attention to redemptive-historical differentiation and to how specific administrations function typologically.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Refines the administration/essence distinction for covenants: differentiates *administrative particulars* (temporary, contextual) from *covenantal substance* (enduring moral and soteriological realities).
 - Proposes pragmatic hermeneutical rules for moral-norm discernment across covenants.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within the Progressive Covenantalism movement as a careful corrective to extremes on both sides.
 - Used by teachers and students seeking a middle-ground methodology for OT ethical application without abandoning Reformed covenantal commitments.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a disciplined framework for handling law/ethics in redemptive-historical theology.
 - Useful pedagogically for demonstrating how to read covenant texts with both continuity and discontinuity in view.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intrusion ethics:** Kline's category for situational, non-normative commands given as covenantal "intrusions"; Wellum critiques its overextension.
- **Progressive Covenantalism:** Wellum's broader framework emphasizing unfolding revelation, covenant administrations, and principled continuity in morality.
- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace:** classical federal categories retained but interpreted within a progressive-unfolding schema.
- **Administration vs. substance:** distinction between temporary covenant forms/mandates and enduring moral/soteriological substance.
- **Redemptive-historical typology:** reading OT institutions as types fulfilled in Christ; used to adjudicate moral and cultic continuity.
- **Normative continuity:** the claim that God's moral character yields enduring moral norms across covenants.
- **Mosaic particularity:** the specific commands, sanctions, and cultic prescriptions whose normative status must be adjudicated.
- **Moral law vs. ceremonial/administrative law:** classical categories retained but re-applied with progressive criteria.
- **Hermeneutical rules for moral discernment:** proposed principles to determine which OT norms are binding.
- **Typological fulfillment:** how certain Mosaic prescriptions point forward to Christ and thus change status in the church.
- **Redemptive-historical progression:** the ordering of revelation across covenants as the key to interpretation.
- **Ethical relativism (risk):** a charge leveled against too-strong intrusion readings; Wellum warns against this.
- **Covenantal community status:** how covenant membership shapes moral expectation across eras.
- **Exegetical prudence:** methodological posture urged for pastors/teachers applying OT law to Christians.
- **Divine command and moral continuity:** anchor for moral normativity across redemptive stages.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for Progressive Covenantalist methodology and vocabulary.
- As a **polemic** against Klinean intrusion ethics and against unnuanced classic federalism.
- As an **exegetical model** for discerning normative OT ethical material in preaching and ethics.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for teaching covenant continuity with principled differentiation of administrations.
