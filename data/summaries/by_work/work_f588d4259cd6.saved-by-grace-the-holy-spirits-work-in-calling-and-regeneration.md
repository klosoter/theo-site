### TITLE
**Saved by Grace: The Holy Spirit's Work in Calling and Regeneration** 
Author: **Herman Bavinck** (Reformed theologian, 1854-1921) 
Place in oeuvre: Part of Bavinck's sustained soteriological and pneumatological reflection in his Reformed Dogmatics and related essays; speaks from late 19th-early 20th century Dutch Reformed context.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late nineteenth / early twentieth century Reformed theology in the Netherlands; Bavinck writes within the confessional, Neo-Calvinist milieu and in dialogue with patristic, scholastic, and modern Protestant sources.
 - Context includes debates with Arminianism, Wesleyanism, theological liberalism, and pietistic subjectivism about conversion and regeneration.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Holy Spirit is the sovereign, primary agent who effectuates the believer's calling and regeneration; conversion is not merely human response but a Spirit-produced new birth that precedes and grounds faith and repentance.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: analysis of biblical language of "call," "new birth," and related terms in the NT to establish the Spirit's role.
 - Theological synthesis: situates regeneration within Reformed doctrines of election, covenant, union with Christ, and the ordo salutis while guarding the unity of salvation history (historia salutis).
 - Pastoral and sacramental application: connects Spirit-work to the means of grace (Word and sacraments) without collapsing objective covenant signs into guarantees of personal salvation.
 - Polemic moves: refutes semi-Pelagian, synergistic accounts that make human will decisive; counters reductionist pietism that severs objective justification from subjective new birth.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on Scripture, Augustine and Calvin for classical precedent; engages scholastic Reformed formulations; positions against Arminius/Wesleyan emphases and against contemporaneous liberal reinterpretations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (primary focus), soteriology (calling, regeneration, faith, repentance, justification), covenant theology, sacraments as means of grace, union with Christ, and implications for sanctification.
- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck centers salvation on the Spirit's sovereign, covenantal work: regeneration is God-initiated, Christ-wrought, sacramentally mediated, and ethically transformative.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Robust insistence on the *monergistic* nature of regeneration without denying human responsibility or the necessity of means of grace.
 - Careful balance between logical order (ordo salutis) and the unity of salvation-history (historia salutis): regeneration logically precedes faith yet is presented pastorally as intertwined with calling and Word.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects predecessors and rivals who either over-intellectualize conversion (reducing it to assent) or spiritualize it into mere emotional experience.
 - Pushes back against any sacramentalism that equates sign with guaranteed grace while affirming sacraments as real means of the Spirit.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced distinctions between external call and effectual call; regeneration as both instantaneous forensic act and the beginning of progressive sanctification.
 - Clarifies relation of repentance and faith as Spirit-produced gifts, not autonomous human acts.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed circles for integrating historical theology, biblical exegesis, and pastoral concern; frequently cited by subsequent Reformed theologians addressing pneumatology and soteriology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model of how to do theological systematic work that is exegetical, dogmatic, pastoral, and polemical in one compact treatment of calling and new birth.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Calling**
 - External (general proclamation of the gospel) vs **effectual** (the Spirit's internal summons bringing new life).
- **Regeneration / New birth**
 - A sovereign, Spirit-initiated renewal that renders a person capable of faith and repentance.
- **Monergism**
 - Emphasis that regeneration is an act of God alone; human will is repaired, not the causal agent.
- **Faith and Repentance**
 - Fruit and gift of regeneration; morally and temporally subsequent in human experience but rooted in the Spirit's prior work.
- **Ordo Salutis vs Historia Salutis**
 - Distinction upheld: Bavinck recognizes logical ordering for doctrinal clarity while maintaining the unity of God's single redemptive action in history.
- **Means of grace**
 - Word and sacraments as instruments through which the Spirit ordinarily works to call and regenerate.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Ground of all benefits; regeneration results from and expresses the believer's real union with Christ effected by the Spirit.
- **Justification (forensic imputation)**
 - Remains objectively forensic; regeneration does not replace but grounds the believer's appropriation of justification.
- **Sanctification (definitive and progressive)**
 - Regeneration as definitive beginning; sanctification unfolds progressively by the Spirit.
- **Law-Gospel distinction**
 - Maintained: Spirit enables hearing of Gospel as such, so law and gospel retain their distinct roles in conversion.
- **Sacramental presence / Lord's Supper**
 - Recognizes sacramental efficacy mediated by the Spirit without endorsing any carte blanche view of personal salvation status.
- **Christs active and passive obedience**
 - Implicitly affirmed as basis for imputed righteousness which the Spirit applies in regeneration and calling.
- **Election**
 - The doctrinal soil out of which effectual calling and regeneration arise.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed pneumatological doctrine of effectual calling and regeneration.
 - As a **polemic** against synergism, Arminianism, and pietistic reductionisms.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for reading NT language of call and new birth grounded in covenantal theology and sacramental practice.
