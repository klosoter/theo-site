### TITLE
Swear to God: The Promise and Power of the Sacraments - Scott Hahn

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Catholic popular-theological and apologetic work (published 2004). Arises from late 20th-early 21st-century Catholic renewal of liturgical and biblical theology; author a convert and prominent catechist (Franciscan University/evangelical-Catholic milieu). Engages both Scripture scholarship and patristic/traditional sources for lay formation and ecumenical dialogue.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Sacraments are not merely signs or rituals but are the sworn promises (oaths) of God enacted and sealed in covenantal form; through them God binds Himself to us and effects salvation. The book addresses modern attenuations of sacramental efficacy and attempts to reframe sacramental theology within the pattern of biblical covenants.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Survey of biblical covenant language: oath, promise, sign, and seal as the matrix for sacramental action.
 - Exposition of each principal sacrament in covenantal terms (Baptism as entry into the covenant, Eucharist as covenant-meal/renewal, etc.).
 - Theological synthesis: sacraments as God's sworn word made present and effective; sacramental power grounded in Christ's priestly oath and paschal mystery.
 - Pastoral and liturgical application: catechesis, reverence, and the communal-covenantal shape of Christian life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (OT covenants primarily: Noahic, Abrahamic, Mosaic, Davidic, New Covenant), Church Fathers (Augustine, Irenaeus), medieval scholastics (Aquinas), Council of Trent formulations; conversant with Reformation critiques (Luther, Calvin) though often polemical; contemporary sacramental theologians and popular Catholic apologists.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology, sacraments, ecclesiology, priesthood, Eucharistic theology (real presence, sacrifice), baptismal theology (regeneration, initiation), revelation (promise-fulfillment), grace and sacramental efficacy.
- **Closing line capturing the center of gravity:** Sacraments are the tangible, oath-bound encounters in which God, by covenantal promise, makes present and guarantees the saving work of Christ to his people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Recasts sacraments primarily as **oaths/promises** - an active relational binding - rather than merely signs or channels of grace.
 - Strong typological linking of Old Testament covenant signs (circumcision, Passover, anointing) to New Testament sacraments as continuity and fulfillment.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges purely instrumentalist or memorial approaches (common in much Protestant theology) by insisting on sacramental efficacy rooted in divine promise.
 - Moves beyond a narrow juridical covenant model to emphasize interpersonal sworn fidelity - God's commitment expressed in visible rites.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The persistent use of legal-oath vocabulary (swear, promise, seal) as the central technical metaphor for sacramental action within a biblically and liturgically grounded framework.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely read in Catholic catechetical and apologetic circles; used as a bridge for some ecumenical conversations by highlighting covenantal continuities.
 - Reformed readers may appreciate covenantal emphases but often contest the ontological sacramental realism and number/efficacy of sacraments.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies the covenantal logic behind sacramental rites and enriches catechesis with biblical-theological depth; valuable for liturgical renewal and ecumenical dialogue about sacramental meaning.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sacrament:** Visible sign instituted by Christ that makes present the divine promises; here framed as an oath-sealed encounter.
- **Covenant:** The primary theological category - relational pact with oath-language that grounds sacramental promise and identity.
- **Oath / Swear:** Central metaphor - God's sworn commitment that sacraments announce and secure.
- **Sign and Seal:** Traditional pair: signs point to realities; seals authenticate the promise (sacramental sealing of grace).
- **Efficacious Sign:** The sacraments effect what they signify because they are the means by which God fulfills his sworn promise.
- **Anamnesis:** Memory/recall in sacramental celebration that makes covenanted history present and operative.
- **Real Presence:** Eucharistic insistence that Christ is truly present; justified by covenant-meal and oathal promise.
- **Baptismal Regeneration / Initiation:** Entry into covenant - incorporation into the body through the sacrament that seals God's promise.
- **Sacramental Economy:** The ordered dispensation of grace through covenantal signs and rites.
- **Priesthood / Sacrificial Language:** Priest as mediator of covenant; Eucharist as renewed covenant-sacrifice tied to Christ's oath and self-giving.
- **Typology:** Use of OT types (Passover, circumcision) to show continuity and fulfillment in sacraments.
- **Seal of the Holy Spirit:** Spirit as guarantor of the covenant promise in sacramental administration.
- **Ex opere operato / ex opere operantis:** Implicit engagement - Hahn emphasizes divine promise over mechanical causality while affirming objective efficacy grounded in God's fidelity.
- **New Covenant:** The culmination - Christ's oath-like self-giving embodied in sacraments.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for sacramental theology framed by covenantal/oath language in catechesis and pastoral formation.
 - As a **polemic and ecumenical pivot** against memorialist or purely symbolic sacramental readings, prompting conversations on sacramental efficacy.
 - As an **exegetical model** linking OT covenantal signs to NT sacramental practice and liturgical theology.
