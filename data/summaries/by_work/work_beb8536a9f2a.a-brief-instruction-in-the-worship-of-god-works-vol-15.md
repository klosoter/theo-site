### TITLE
**John Owen, A Brief Instruction in the Worship of God (Works, vol. 15)** 
A catechetical digest of instituted gospel worship and congregational discipline in Restoration-era English Nonconformity.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Post-1662 Restoration England; Nonconformist Congregationalism (Savoy Declaration milieu).
 - Contests Anglican liturgy/ceremonies, Erastian supremacy, and national-church assumptions; converses with Reformed debates on the regulative principle.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - **Christ alone is the lawgiver of worship**; only what he instituted is lawful. True worship is **spiritual**, performed by the regenerate, through the mediation of Christ, in gathered gospel churches ordered by his appointments.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Rule and object of worship: Scripture sufficiency; the Triune God (Father, Son, and **the Holy Spirit as a divine person**).
 - Mediator and access: Christ's priesthood and **impeccability** secure acceptable worship.
 - Nature of gospel worship: in Spirit and truth; internal and external acts distinguished; rejection of inventions (**will-worship**).
 - Elements and ordinances: reading/preaching, prayer, singing, sacraments (baptism, the Lord's Supper), and discipline; separation of **elements** from **circumstances**.
 - Church constitution: **visible congregations** of professing believers (drawn via **regeneration/effectual calling**); officers (elders, deacons); admission, censures, and restoration.
 - Old and new covenants: Mosaic rites abrogated; appeal to **covenant of works** (as to the national/legal substance of Israel) vs. **covenant of grace** to ground NT simplicity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture as primary authority; Reformed stream (Calvin, Ames; Savoy/Westminster formulations).
 - Interlocutors: Laudian Anglicanism (liturgy/ceremonies), Presbyterian establishment, Erastian civil theory, Roman sacerdotalism; anti-Socinian notes in affirming Spirit's deity.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture; Trinity (esp. **person/deity of the Holy Spirit**); Christology (mediation, **impeccability**); soteriology (**effectual calling**); ecclesiology (visible/invisible church, polity, sacraments, discipline); covenant theology (**covenant of works**, Mosaic status; covenant of grace); sin (idolatry, origin and tendency of **will-worship**).
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: **Christ-instituted, Spirit-empowered, covenantally grounded simplicity** in the gathered church's worship and discipline.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Tight linkage of acceptable worship to **regeneration** and sanctifying operations of the Spirit.
 - Strong, catechetically clear **elements vs. circumstances** account under the regulative principle.
 - Congregational polity as an instituted pattern, with discipline integral to worship's holiness.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Anglican set liturgies/ceremonies and sacerdotal intermediation; against Erastian civil imposition.
 - Against Presbyterian national-church uniformity; for voluntary, covenanted, visible congregations.
 - Against enthusiasm: Spirit-led worship is **Word-regulated**, not novelty-driven.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of the Mosaic covenant's **works-aspect** to argue the abrogation of ceremonial/instrumental shadows and defend NT simplicity.
 - Explicit trinitarian orientation of worship, including honoring the **Holy Spirit** as God.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a teaching tool in Congregational churches and dissenting academies; informs later Reformed discussions of RPW, psalmody, and church discipline.
 - Cited across Reformed traditions (including Baptists) for elements/circumstances and discipline praxis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a portable template for evaluating practices by institution.
 - Bridges exegesis, covenant theology, and polity for coherent pastoral application.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Regulative Principle of Worship (RPW)**: Only divinely instituted elements are lawful in worship; human additions are **will-worship**.
- **Elements vs. Circumstances**
 - Elements: God-instituted acts (Word, prayer, sacraments, singing, discipline).
 - Circumstances: variable necessities (time, place, order) governed by general rules of Scripture.
- **Institution**: Christ's positive appointment authorizing an element of worship.
- **Spiritual Worship**: Performed in the **Holy Spirit** and truth; inward faith and love expressed in ordained means.
- **Mediator of Worship**: Christ's priesthood and **impeccability** make our worship acceptable to God.
- **Regeneration / Effectual Calling**: Spirit's work constituting true worshipers and proper church members.
- **Visible vs. Invisible Church**
 - Invisible: the elect united to Christ.
 - Visible: congregations of professing believers under ordinances and discipline.
- **Covenant of Works**: Principle of law/works operative in Adam and, in a national/legal respect, in the **Mosaic covenant**, now abrogated in its ceremonial-typological forms.
- **Covenant of Grace**: Redemptive covenant structuring gospel worship and sacraments.
- **Accommodation**: OT shadows as divine condescension to a church under age; fulfilled and removed in Christ.
- **Nature and Origin of Sin**: From Adam's fall; sin begets idolatry and corrupts worship through human inventions.
- **Ordinances**: Reading/preaching, prayer, singing, baptism (incl. infants), Lord's Supper, and church discipline.
- **Officers**: Elders (pastors/teachers) for oversight and Word; deacons for mercy/service.
- **Discipline (Keys of the Kingdom)**: Admission, admonition, censure, and restoration as Christ-instituted.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source for RPW, elements/circumstances, and congregational discipline.
 - Polemical touchstone against liturgical impositions, sacerdotalism, and Erastian control.
 - Exegetical-conceptual model for OT/NT discontinuity via covenantal analysis.
 - Integrative pivot linking soteriology (regeneration) to ecclesiology and worship practice.
