### TITLE
The Gospel of the Kingdom (essay in Selected Shorter Writings, Vol. 1) - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th / early 20th century Princeton evangelicalism; Warfield writing against liberal theology and the Social Gospel movement; collected in Selected Shorter Writings (Vol. 1) as a representative theological essay addressing New Testament thought and pastoral implications.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The gospel properly understood is the proclamation of the kingship of Christ - a real, spiritual reign already inaugurated in Christ's work and the preaching of the gospel, yet awaiting consummation - and must not be reduced to mere social reform or abstract ethical principlism.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Establishes what the New Testament means by "kingdom of God" and situates it in Christ's person and work.
 - Argues that the kingdom is essentially a reign (kingship) - relational and sovereign - not identical with church institution nor primarily a program of social amelioration.
 - Identifies the gospel as the announcement and summons to enter that reign: conversion and faith are the means by which the kingdom is present.
 - Distinguishes present-inaugurated reality from future-consummation; stresses continuity (one sovereign purpose) rather than fragmentation into purely social or political dimensions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Implicit/explicit critique of Social Gospel proponents (e.g., Washington Gladden, Walter Rauschenbusch) who emphasize social transformation as the kingdom.
 - Engagement with contemporary biblical scholarship and historical theology that tended to dilute the gospel into ethical schemes.
 - Warfield writes from the Reformed, confessional frame (Princeton circle) with appeal to Scripture and patristic/orthodox categories.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (kingly identity and work), soteriology (gospel as means of entrance into reign), ecclesiology (relation of kingdom and church), eschatology (inaugurated vs. consummated kingdom), authority of Scripture (hermeneutical presupposition for defining kingdom).
- **Closing line:** Warfield centers the gospel as proclamation of Christ's sovereign reign - a spiritual kingdom that is present wherever the gospel effects faith and will be consummated by Christ - resisting reduction to social program or institutional identification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that the kingdom is essentially Christ's reign (a theocratic, spiritual sovereignty) rather than a sociopolitical or purely ethical movement.
 - Gospel defined primarily as authoritative proclamation leading to conversion and submission to Christ's kingship.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Social Gospel tendencies by relocating the kingdom's power in redemption and new birth rather than in social reform alone.
 - Pushes back against theological liberalism that historicizes or moralizes "kingdom" into secular progress.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** While not inventing new terminology, Warfield reasserts older confessional distinctions - kingdom as reign (potentia, imperium) vs. church as visible organism - clarifying their functional relation without collapsing one into the other.
- **Reception and influence:** Esteemed within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles for restoring gospel-centered kingdom theology; used as a corrective in early- to mid-20th century debates over social Christianity and remains cited in discussions of kingdom ecclesiology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Provides a compact, historically rooted defense of gospel-centered kingdom thinking; valuable for courses on gospel and society, Reformed ecclesiology, and critiques of Social Gospel/postliberal tendencies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Gospel:** Proclamation of Christ's person and salvific reign; the means by which individuals are summoned into the kingdom.
- **Kingdom of God / Kingdom of Heaven:** The sovereign reign of Christ; present in power in the gospel and awaiting consummation.
- **Reign / Kingship (imperium):** Emphasized as the core category for understanding "kingdom" - relational sovereignty over hearts and history.
- **Church:** Visible community wherein the reign is manifested through faith and sacraments, distinct from but instrumentally related to the kingdom.
- **Inaugurated eschatology:** The kingdom is present now in seed form (through Christ and gospel) and future in fullness at consummation.
- **Consummation:** The future completion of Christ's reign and final ordering of creation under his sovereignty.
- **Social Gospel (critique):** Movement that Warfield critiques for reducing kingdom to social reform and thereby undermining gospel primacy.
- **Conversion / Faith:** The human response that constitutes entry into the kingdom; ethical fruit follows but does not replace initial gospel summons.
- **Authority of Scripture:** Ground for Warfield's kingdom claims; biblical exegesis is normative against speculative social theology.
- **Christology:** The kingly identity of Christ as foundational - kingdom discourse centered on the person-work of Jesus.
- **Soteriology:** Salvation as transfer into Christ's reign; not merely moral improvement but covenantal renewal.
- **Ecclesiology (relation to kingdom):** Church as the instrument and sign of the kingdom, not its ontological equivalent.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definitional source** for conservative Reformed accounts of "kingdom" grounded in Christ's reign.
 - As a **polemic** against Social Gospel and liberal reconstruals that secularize kingdom language.
 - As an **exegetical-model** emphasizing proclamation, conversion, and inaugurated-consummated tension for classroom and homiletic application.
