### TITLE
Nature and Grace

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** mid-20th century theological renewal (ressourcement) that reevaluated Neo-Scholastic formulations; critique of post-Tridentine manuals that posited a "pure nature" separable from the supernatural. Often associated with the work of ressourcement theologians (notably Henri de Lubac), though here treated as a conceptual work rather than a single-author monograph.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** the classical problem of whether human nature is self-sufficient (capable of its ordered end) or intrinsically oriented toward a supernatural end (a natural desire for grace). The book rejects an impermeable nature/grace dualism and argues for an ordered relationality in which grace fulfills and transcends nature without mere addition.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Historical diagnosis: traces the rise of the "pure nature" theory in post-Reformation Scholasticism and its consequences for theology and piety.
 - Theological anthropology: argues for a constitutive openness of human nature toward the beatific or supernatural end.
 - Doctrinal re-synthesis: proposes a dynamic relation-grace as intrinsic fulfillment rather than an extrinsic patch-recovering biblical and patristic perspectives.
 - Practical implications: sacramental, ecclesiological, and apologetic consequences follow from a reconstituted nature-grace relation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** patristic witnesses (Augustine, Gregory), medieval and post-medieval Scholastics (Aquinas, later manualists), contemporary ressourcement figures; interlocution with Neo-Scholastic critics and modern Protestant covenant and natural theology discussions.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation and natural theology; grace and the supernatural; anthropology and telos; Christology (as fulfillment of human destiny); sacraments and ecclesiology; implicit engagement with covenantal frameworks.
- **Closing line:** theological center of gravity: grace is not an external corrective to a self-sufficient nature but the fulfillment and true destiny of nature-requiring a reorientation of natural theology, ecclesiology, and Christian ethics.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Desiderium naturaliter inhaerens** (the naturally inherent desire) as the motif: nature bears a constitutive orientation toward the supernatural end.
 - Integration of patristic teleology with modern questions about the scope and possibility of natural knowledge of God.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Challenges Neo-Scholastic "pure nature" models that isolate natural ends and treat grace as merely accidental or extrinsic.
 - Rehabilitates pre-scholastic and patristic organic teleology against the later manualist, juridical framings.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts "supernatural" as intrinsic fulfillment rather than an addendum; reframes "order" between nature and grace as relational and dynamic rather than hierarchical and detachable.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Major influence on 20th-century Catholic theology and the Second Vatican Council's sacramental and ecclesiological emphases.
 - Provoked sustained debate among Neo-Thomists and attracted critical engagement from Protestant theologians interested in natural theology and covenant continuities.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provocative corrective to reductionist accounts of natural religion and to overly juridical ecclesiology.
 - Valuable as a bridge between patristic theology and contemporary debates about the knowability of God and the nature of Christian community.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pure nature:** the thesis that human nature has a complete, sufficient end apart from any supernatural destiny; the main target of critique.
- **Supernatural (proper):** understood as the end that exceeds natural capacities but which is nonetheless the true completion of nature.
- **Desiderium naturaliter inhaerens:** the natural desire inherently directed toward a supernatural beatitude.
- **Fulfillment vs. addition:** contrast showing grace as completion of nature rather than an external addition.
- **Capax Dei:** capacity or openness of the creature for God; used to rebut strict natural/supernatural separation.
- **Natural theology (existence and knowability of God):**
 - Treated as limited but significant; natural reason gives inklings and desire that point beyond itself rather than providing full beatific knowledge.
- **Visible and invisible church distinction:** emphasizes how sacramental, visible forms embody a grace that fulfills natural social and spiritual needs; critiques rigid separations that make visible institutions merely juridical shells.
- **Intrusion ethics / Klinean covenant language:** dialogical contrast:
 - Aligns with the intuition that the supernatural "intrudes" into history, but resists a purely discontinuous reading; proposes continuity of human telos and a transformative intrusion.
 - Used to critique simplistic covenant intrusions that ignore nature's orienting desire.
- **Ordered teleology:** final causality is reasserted as key to understanding human destiny.
- **Gratuitousness of grace:** maintained-grace remains unmerited even as it is the fulfillment of nature.
- **Ecclesial sacramentality:** sacraments as loci where the nature/grace relation is visibly enacted.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for the concept of a "natural desire for the supernatural" in natural theology debates.
 - As a **polemic tool** against Neo-Scholastic "pure nature" framings and against ecclesiologies that privatize grace.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating patristic teleology into contemporary covenantal and sacramental theology.
