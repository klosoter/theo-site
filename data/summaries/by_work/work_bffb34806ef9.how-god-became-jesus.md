### TITLE
How God Became Jesus - Michael F. Bird & Craig A. Evans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the context of renewed public and scholarly debate over the historicity and chronology of Christian high Christology (notably responses to mythicist claims by Earl Doherty, Robert M. Price, Richard Carrier).
 - Situated within conservative-evangelical New Testament scholarship with engagement across historical-critical and apologetic audiences.
 - Interacts with contemporary specialists on early Christology (e.g., Larry Hurtado, Richard Bauckham, James D. G. Dunn) and popular skeptics.

- **Central thesis**
 - The conviction that Jesus is divine (i.e., that early Christians worshiped Jesus as God) emerges within the earliest generations of Christianity and is explicable within Jewish monotheistic contexts rather than being a late pagan interpolation or invention.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of primary evidence for early Christian beliefs: Pauline letters, the Gospel traditions, Johannine literature, early creeds/hymns (e.g., Philippians 2).
 - Analysis of titles and praxis: "kyrios," "Son of God," baptismal and liturgical practices, early worship directed to Jesus.
 - Contextualization in Second Temple Judaism and Greco-Roman religio-cultural milieu-demonstrating compatibility with Jewish monotheism and rejecting simplistic Hellenization models.
 - Polemical treatment of mythicist and radical revisionist arguments; methodological defense of early dating for high Christological expressions.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary sources: Paul (esp. key passages like Romans, 1 Corinthians, Philippians), Synoptic tradition, Gospel of John, early Christian inscriptions and patristic echoes.
 - Interlocutors: mythicists (Doherty, Price, Carrier), skeptical popularizers (some New Atheist claims), and scholarly voices across the spectrum (Hurtado, Bauckham, Dunn).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Christology** (origin and nature of belief in Jesus' divinity, pre-existence, incarnation themes)
 - **Trinity** indirectly (as consequence of early divine Christ beliefs)
 - **Revelation and worship** (how Jesus functions as divine Savior and object of cultic devotion)
 - **Monotheism** (limits and elasticity in Second Temple Judaism)

- **Closing line**
 - The book argues that early Christian high Christology is historically attainable and theologically intelligible within first-century Jewish monotheism rather than a later pagan retrofit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Combines concise apologetic thrust with detailed historical-theological argumentation aimed at both scholarly and lay readers.
 - Emphasizes continuity with Jewish monotheism rather than rupture-argues early believers reinterpreted, not abandoned, Jewish monotheistic commitments.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back against mythicist theses that deny a historical Jesus or place divine attribution centuries later.
 - Challenges simplistic Hellenistic contagion models that explain Christian divinization solely by pagan influence.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - No radical new technical terminology; rather, a methodological synthesis-using attestation, liturgical practice, and epigraphic evidence as convergent lines to establish early high Christology.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Positively received in many evangelical and mainstream academic circles as a compact, accessible defense of early Christ-divinity claims.
 - Criticized by some historians for brisk treatment of contested datings and for polemical tone toward mythicists; appreciated by teachers and apologists for clarity and breadth.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a clear, compact compendium of evidence for early divine christology; useful for teaching, introductory graduate overviews, and polemical engagement with mythicism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **High Christology**
 - Early attributions of divine status, worship, and pre-existence to Jesus; central explanatory category of the book.
- **Kyrios**
 - Title translated "Lord"; used as linguistic and theological evidence that Jesus received divine honor in early Christian circles.
- **Philippians 2 hymn**
 - Presented as an early pre-Pauline confession suggesting pre-existence, incarnation, and worship-cornerstone for dating high Christology.
- **Pre-existence**
 - The claim that the exalted Jesus existed with God prior to earthly life; treated as attested early in Christian sources.
- **Incarnation**
 - The theological articulation that the pre-existent divine figure became flesh in Jesus; discussed as logical development from early confession.
- **Monotheism (Second Temple)**
 - Jewish single-God commitment and its interpretive flexibility; used to rebut claims that early divine Jesus necessarily implies pagan polytheism.
- **Worship / cultic practice**
 - Baptism, prayer, hymns, and other acts directed to Jesus used as pragmatic evidence for early divine status.
- **Mythicism**
 - The thesis denying a historical Jesus or contending that early belief in his divinity is a late invention; primary polemical target.
- **Son of God / Son of Man**
 - Titles analyzed for their semantic range and early usage in confession and gospel traditions.
- **Pauline creedal material**
 - Short, pre-formulated confessions embedded in Paul's letters (e.g., "Christ died for our sins") serving as early attestations.
- **Epigraphic / inscriptional evidence**
 - Non-literary attestations of devotion to Jesus used to supplement textual claims.
- **Adoptionism**
 - Theories proposing later elevation to divinity; book contrasts adoptionist readings with earlier, high-christology readings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "early high Christology" in classroom and apologetic settings.
- As a **polemic** and rebuttal against mythicist and late-origin claims about Jesus' divinity.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline confessions, hymns, and "kyrios" language as early attestations rather than late theological developments.
