### TITLE
The Oxford Treatise and Disputation on the Eucharist - Peter Martyr Vermigli

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation; Vermigli arrived in England (c. 1547) at Cranmer's invitation and participated in Oxford disputations and writings on the sacrament amid Edwardian reforms (late 1540s-1550s).
 - Milieu: contested Eucharistic theology among Roman Catholic scholastics, Lutheran sacramentalists, Swiss Reformed theologians, and English reformers seeking a confessional middle way.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To reject both Roman transubstantiation and mere memorialism, and to articulate how the Eucharist truly communicates Christ to believers as a **means of grace** without physical/locative presence of Christ's human body in the elements.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Scriptural and patristic exegesis establishes the Eucharist as Christ's ordinance that signs and seals salvific benefits.
 - Christological constraint: because Christ's human nature is united to the divine Person and is ascended and localized in heaven, his corporeal presence cannot be physically in many places in the bread and wine.
 - Sacramental instrumentality: sacraments are **instruments** employed by God; they effect benefit by the Holy Spirit through faith, not by a material substantial change of the elements.
 - Rejection of Catholic "ex opere operato" and Lutheran ubiquity/consubstantiation; affirmation of a **spiritual real presence** - believers truly receive Christ by faith through the Spirit.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Appeals to Augustine and patristic tradition; critical engagement with Thomas Aquinas and later scholastic manuals; polemics with Catholic defenders of transubstantiation and with both Lutheran and Zwinglian positions.
 - Reformed interlocutors: Bucer, Calvin, and English leaders (Cranmer) inform and contest developments.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (hypostatic union, ascension), pneumatology (Spirit's role in sacramental reception), soteriology (faith, justification), ecclesiology (communion), sacramental theology (signs, efficacy, instrumentality).
- **Closing line**
 - Vermigli places the Eucharist at the intersection of Christology and pneumatology: as a God‑ordained instrument that, through the Spirit and faith, **really** (but not corporeally) communicates Christ and salvation to believers.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Uses the **hypostatic union** as a decisive constraint: Christ's human body cannot be multiply present in the elements; hence presence must be spiritual.
 - Emphasizes **instrumental causality**: sacraments are means by which God grants grace, not intrinsic material causes.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Roman Catholic metaphysical account (substantial change) by denying Aristotelian substantialism as necessary for sacramental efficacy.
 - Rejects both Lutheran ubiquity/physical presence and Zwinglian mere sign theory; insists on a true reception tied to the Spirit and faith.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear coupling of sacramental efficacy to the **operation of the Holy Spirit upon faith** rather than to material transformation or ritual magic.
 - Precise distinction between sign (visible element) and thing signified (Christ received by faith) with an emphasis on causal instrumentality.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in shaping English and continental Reformed Eucharistic formulations; used by Cranmer and taken up in Reformed circles as a model for balancing realism and anti-scholasticism.
 - Later overshadowed by Calvin in some contexts but remained a touchstone for Reformed defenses against both Roman and Lutheran claims.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models how to ground sacramental theology in Christology and pneumatology; valuable for teaching a Reformed account of sacraments as means of grace without reverting to medieval metaphysics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Transubstantiation** - medieval Catholic doctrine denied: Vermigli rejects a substantial ontological change of bread/wine.
- **Real presence (spiritual)** - affirmation that Christ is truly received, not by local corporeal presence but by the Spirit to believers.
- **Hypostatic union** - used as a theological constraint: Christ's human nature is united to the divine Person and is not multiply locatable in elements.
- **Instrumental causality** - sacraments are instruments through which God (the principal cause) effects grace.
- **Sign and thing signified** - clear distinction: visible elements are signs that genuinely convey the thing signified (Christ's benefits) to the faithful.
- **Ex opere operato** - implicitly critiqued: sacramental efficacy is not automatic apart from faith and the Spirit.
- **Faith (reception)** - faith is the necessary means by which the communicative benefit is received in the believer.
- **Pneumatological efficacy** - the Holy Spirit is the immediate agent who applies Christ to the believer in the sacrament.
- **Consubstantiation / ubiquity** - positions Vermigli rejects as insufficiently Christological or too physical.
- **Efficacy / means of grace** - sacraments are ordained channels through which God communicates grace.
- **Patristic appeal** - consistent use of Augustine to ground the Reformed balance of realism and spirituality.
- **Scholastic method** - retention of scholastic precision without endorsing its metaphysical conclusions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Reformed sacramental theology: clarifies "means of grace" as Spirit‑mediated, faith‑received instrumentality.
- As a **polemic text** against Roman transubstantiation and Lutheran ubiquity, often cited in debates on Eucharistic presence.
- As an **exegetical model** combining patristic exegesis with scholastic reasoning to justify a spiritually real presence.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching sacraments: demonstrates how Christology + pneumatology determine sacramental doctrine.
