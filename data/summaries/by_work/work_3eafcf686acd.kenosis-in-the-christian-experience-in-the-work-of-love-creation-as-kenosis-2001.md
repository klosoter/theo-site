### TITLE
Kenosis in the Christian Experience - Jürgen Moltmann (essay in The Work of Love: Creation as Kenosis, 2001)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-career Moltmann (post-Theology of Hope, The Crucified God); situated within late 20th / early 21st-century constructive theologies concerned with suffering, ecology, and the Trinity.
 - Moves kenotic Christology beyond soteriology into doctrines of creation, providence and the life of God in history.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Creation is itself an act of divine kenosis: God freely self-limits (empties) to make space for creaturely freedom and vulnerability; divine love is expressed as self-giving, not unilateral control.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical hinge: Philippians 2 kenosis motif as the Christological model that can inform divine action in creation.
 - Theological re-articulation: kenosis interpreted trinitarianly - the Son's self-emptying and the Father/Spirit's relational reciprocity ground a doctrine of a vulnerable, relational God.
 - Systematic consequences: re-configures attributes (impassibility, immutability), providence (non-coercive governance), and eschatology (hope grounded in God's solidarity).
 - Practical corollary: ethics and ecology - creatures' freedom and suffering require a God who suffers and suffers with creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary scriptural locus: Philippians 2; also passion narratives and Johannine Christology as background.
 - Engages tradition: patristic and scholastic positions on impassibility/immutability; contrasts with classical theism (Aquinas-style) and some modern systematicians.
 - Conversant with contemporary thinkers: dialogue and contrast with Barthian emphases, process thinkers, and other kenotic theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (kenotic reading of the Incarnation)
 - Trinity (economic relations as model for intra-divine self-giving)
 - Creation and providence (creation as self-limitation; providence as non-coercive)
 - Soteriology and eschatology (solidarity with suffering; hope rooted in God's self-emptying love)
- **Closing line**
 - Moltmann centers a theology of love: God's greatness is shown in willing self-limitation - creation is divine kenosis that grounds hope, responsibility, and God's solidarity with a suffering world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats creation itself as kenotic - not only the Incarnation - so divine self-emptying is constitutive of how God relates to finite reality.
 - Stresses vulnerability and relationality as divine modes rather than mere human analogies.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges classical theism's stress on impassibility and absolute immutability by arguing these traits must be reinterpreted in light of God's self-giving love.
 - Distinguishes from reductive kenoticisms that imply loss of deity: insists kenosis is volitional gift, not diminution of divine essence.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Moves kenosis from primarily Christological rubric into a normative category for creation, providence, and ethics.
 - Recasts divine omnipotence as *non-coercive omnipotence* - power expressed as self-limitation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in ecological, liberation, and pastoral theologies; taken up by theologians who seek a God who suffers with the world.
 - Provoked critique from classical theists and some analytic theologians wary of compromising divine aseity or risking process theology affinities.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a paradigmatic resource for theology that seeks to hold together divine transcendence and compassion; fertile for interdisciplinary work on ecology and suffering.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis**
 - Self-emptying; for Moltmann, an act of divine love operative in Christ and creation.
- **Creation as kenosis**
 - The thesis that God creates by self-limitation to allow genuine creaturely freedom and vulnerability.
- **Perichoresis**
 - Trinitarian mutual indwelling reframed to show intra-divine self-giving rather than static divine monopolies.
- **Non-coercive omnipotence**
 - Divine power realized through relational persuasion and permitting, not unilateral control.
- **Divine vulnerability / passibility**
 - God is able to suffer and be affected; vulnerability is a mark of divine love, not deficiency.
- **Immutability reinterpreted**
 - Stability conceived as faithful being-in-relation rather than absolute changelessness that precludes response.
- **Philippians 2 (kenotic hymn)**
 - Exegetical cornerstone: Christ's emptying reads as the model for divine comportment toward creation.
- **Economic Trinity**
 - The way God acts in history evidences intra-Trinitarian self-giving; economic relations illuminate immanent life.
- **Freedom of the creature**
 - A theological motive for kenosis: creation requires genuine autonomy which presupposes divine self-limitation.
- **Solidarity / suffering**
 - God's participation in creaturely suffering supports pastoral and political theology of comfort and engagement.
- **Eschatological hope**
 - Hope rooted in God's committed, suffering love rather than in deterministic sovereignty.
- **The Work of Love (title-context)**
 - Frames kenosis as the operative divine activity that makes relational life and ethics possible.

How this work is used across loci
- As a **definition source** for modern kenotic theology that extends kenosis beyond Christology into creation and providence.
- As a **polemic** against classical theism's impassibility and a corrective to doctrines that detach God from suffering and history.
- As an **exegetical model** for interpreting Phil 2 and integrating that hymn into systematic Trinitarian and creation theology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in ecological, pastoral, and liberation theologies that need a robust doctrine of divine solidarity and non-coercive power.
