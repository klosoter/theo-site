### TITLE
The Evolution of Adam - Peter Enns

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in the 21st-century context of growing evangelical engagement with evolutionary biology and the genomic revolution. Moves within the broader conversation among evangelical scholars seeking to reconcile orthodox doctrine with scientific data.
 - Positioned against both young-earth creationism and naïve concordism; part of a cluster of works (e.g., John Walton, Denis Lamoureux) rethinking Genesis genre and theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The biblical portrait of Adam is primarily **theological/representative** rather than a straightforward scientific or biological claim about the first human pair; therefore theology of sin and salvation must be reframed in light of evolutionary science and the biblical genres available to ancient authors.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of scientific data on human origins (paleontology, genetics, population genetics) that undermines the plausibility of a single original human couple as the biological source of all modern humans.
 - Literary and canonical exegesis of Genesis and New Testament texts (notably Paul) to show diverse uses of "Adam" in Scripture and to argue that biblical authors operate with ancient Near Eastern categories and theological aims.
 - Theological reconstruction: distinguishes **historical-biological** Adam from **theological-representative** Adam and proposes ways to preserve the doctrinal center (sin, human culpability, Christ as representative) without asserting a biologically first couple incompatible with science.
 - Practical implications for doctrine (original sin, image of God, Christology, soteriology) and pastoral theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Scripture (Genesis, Romans 5, 1 Corinthians), patristic interpreters (Augustine, Irenaeus), modern evangelical scholars (critique of young-earth proponents; dialogue with John Walton and others who emphasize genre), and scientific literature on human evolution and population genetics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (genre, authority, hermeneutics), anthropology (image of God, human origins), hamartiology (original sin, transmission of guilt), soteriology/Christology (Christ as new Adam), and theological method (relationship of theology and science).

- **Closing line**
 - Enns presses that a faithful theology can hold the **theological centrality of Adam** without insisting on a biologically exclusive first couple; the heart of the Gospel-human culpability met by Christ's representative work-can survive a non‑concordist reading of Genesis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong hermeneutical priority: genre and ancient authorial intent shape what Genesis can be expected to claim; scientific data legitimately constrain literalist readings.
 - Clear distinction between **biological origins** and **theological representation**, allowing retention of creedal and soteriological language without requiring biological historicity.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects young-earth/concordist readings that read modern science into Genesis and then shape theology around that reading.
 - Contrasts with some theistic-evolutionists who downplay the fall: Enns insists on preserving a robust doctrine of sin and solidarity even if Adam is not a unique founding pair.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Popularizes practical use of labels like **"archetypal Adam"** and **"representative Adam"** versus "first biological human," useful for theological precision.
 - Emphasizes the category of **theological function** over empirical historicity in biblical persons.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Provoked sharp debate in evangelical circles: praised for integrating science and responsible exegesis by some; criticized as undermining historic doctrines by others.
 - Influential in clergy and academic settings as a bridge text for discussing anthropology, sin, and science among evangelicals.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model for disciplined interplay of exegesis, doctrine, and science; useful in classrooms and churches confronting genomic findings and ancient literary contexts.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Archetypal/Representative Adam** - Adam as theological head and paradigm for humanity rather than necessarily a biological progenitor.
- **Historical-biological Adam** - The claim that all humans descend from a single first pair; Enns questions this on scientific grounds.
- **Genre hermeneutics** - Reading Genesis with attention to ANE literary forms and ancient authorial intentions.
- **Concordism** - The attempt to make Scripture's language align with modern scientific descriptions; critiqued as exegetically naive.
- **Population genetics** - Scientific argument used to challenge the plausibility of a single-couple origin for modern humans.
- **Original sin (reframed)** - Maintains the reality of corporate/representative guilt and corruption but shifts emphasis away from strictly genetic transmission.
- **Image of God (imago Dei)** - Treated as theological status and function, not reducible to a genetic marker; remains central to human dignity.
- **Christ as New Adam** - Retained as soteriological axis; Enns preserves representative readings of Paul while detaching them from necessary biological priors.
- **Theological function vs. empirical claim** - A hermeneutical distinction Enns uses to allocate which biblical claims are intended as theological teaching versus factual description.
- **Ancient Near Eastern context** - Background that shapes Genesis' categories and should shape modern interpretation.
- **Hermeneutical humility** - Methodological posture urging caution when biblical texts intersect with scientific discourse.
- **Non-concordist reading** - An approach Enns advocates that resists forcing Scripture to answer modern scientific questions.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Genesis in light of ANE genre and canonical theology.
- As a **polemic** against young-earth/concordist approaches within evangelicalism.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in systematic theology courses on anthropology and hamartiology to rethink formulations of original sin and human solidarity.
- As a pastoral and pedagogical resource for congregations wrestling with evolution and biblical authority.
