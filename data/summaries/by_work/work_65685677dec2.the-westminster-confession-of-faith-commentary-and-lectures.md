### TITLE
The Westminster Confession of Faith (commentary and lectures) - Author unknown

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Produced by the Westminster Assembly (1643-1649) in the English Civil War era; rooted in English and Scottish Puritan/Reformed traditions; intended as a national confession for Church and state reformation and as a consolidating statement of Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To provide a comprehensive, ordered, and authoritative summary of Reformed theology that defends sola Scriptura and the sovereignty of God while prescribing ecclesial order and practice.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Ordered confession in 33 chapters moving from Scripture and God to Christ, salvation, covenant, church, sacraments, civil magistrate, and last things.
 - Systematic emphasis: revelation -> covenant -> person and work of Christ -> application of redemption (calling, justification, adoption, sanctification, perseverance) -> church and sacraments -> magistrate and eschatology.
 - Pastoral-programmatic aim: catechesis, disciplinary norms, theological boundary-setting.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as primary source; heavy reliance on Calvinist theologians (Calvin, Bucer), earlier Reformed confessions; polemical engagement with Roman Catholic theology, Arminianism, Anglican episcopal models, and Congregationalist/Independent ecclesiology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Scripture and its authority; the Trinity; providence; predestination and election; covenant theology (works and grace); Christology and atonement; grace in effectual calling and justification by faith; sanctification and good works; the nature, marks, government, and discipline of the church; sacraments as signs and seals; civil magistrate; eschatology.
- **Site references used:** explicit treatment and commentary on **Church and Kingdom** and on **Nature and Marks of the Church**.
- **Closing line:** The Confession centers Reformed theology on the covenantal and sovereign God who reveals Himself in Scripture, achieves redemption in Christ, and governs a visible yet disciplined church ordered to God's glory.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Systematic presentation of **covenant theology** (Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace) as the organizing framework for soteriology and ecclesiology.
 - Rigorous articulation of **sola Scriptura** with a highly juridical, article-by-article precision.
 - Clear juridical language about God's sovereignty and effectual calling that grounds a robust doctrine of **particular election** and perseverance.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - More legally ordered and presbyterian than the Thirty-Nine Articles; sharper anti-Roman Catholic polemic than some continental Reformed statements.
 - Opposes Arminian conditionalism on election and rejects Congregationalist claims for congregational independence by asserting a Presbyterian polity and authorized magistrate.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinctive vocabulary for church order: "power of the keys," visible vs. invisible church, marks of the true church, sacraments as "signs and seals."
 - Systematization of pastoral and disciplinary norms within a confessional-legal framework.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Became the confessional standard for Presbyterian churches in Britain, North America, and later Reformed bodies worldwide; served as primary textbook in Reformed seminaries.
 - Ongoing use in ecclesial ordination, discipline, and doctrinal adjudication; contested by Baptists, Independents, and some Anglicans.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a compact pedagogical resource combining doctrine, ecclesiology, and discipline; remains a decisive reference for historical theology, confessional studies, and Reformed pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura:** Scripture is the only sufficient, infallible rule of faith and life; all doctrine measured against it.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace:** Twofold covenantal structure organizing human responsibility and divine redemption.
- **Predestination / Election:** Unconditional election; God's sovereign choice for salvation precedes and grounds calling and justification.
- **Justification by Faith:** Forensic declaration by God; imputed righteousness of Christ received through faith alone.
- **Sanctification and Perseverance:** Progressive renewal by the Spirit with assurance of final perseverance for the elect.
- **Visible vs. Invisible Church:** Distinction between the outward organized assembly and the inward body known to God; visible church identified by certain marks.
 - **Marks of the Church:** Right preaching of the Word, proper administration of the sacraments, and church discipline (see commentary on Nature and Marks of the Church).
- **Power of the Keys / Church Discipline:** Authority to admit, exclude, and exercise corrective measures in the visible church to preserve purity.
- **Sacraments as Signs and Seals:** Baptism and the Lord's Supper only; not means of intrinsic regeneration but seals of God's promises.
- **Presbyterian Polity:** Ordered governance by elders and assemblies; rejection of episcopal hierarchy and congregational isolation.
- **Civil Magistrate:** God-ordained authority with duties to preserve public peace and true religion, within limits set by Scripture.
- **Kingdom of Christ:** Spiritual reign enacted through the church and gospel (see commentary on Church and Kingdom).
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Reformed doctrine and confessional identity across theology, worship, and polity.
 - As a **polemic resource** against Roman Catholic, Arminian, and congregationalist positions.
 - As an **exegetical and pastoral model** for instructing congregations, forming catechesis, and structuring church discipline.
