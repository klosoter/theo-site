### TITLE
Jesus the Son of God - D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical New Testament scholarship. Written amid debates over the historical Jesus, Bultmannian demythologizing, the "new perspective" on Paul, and rising popular critiques (mythicism, reductionist histories).
 - Aimed at academic and pastoral audiences within conservative/Reformed-evangelical milieus seeking rigorous exegetical defense of New Testament Christology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The New Testament presents Jesus as truly divine - the incarnate Son of God - and this high Christology is rooted in first-century Jewish monotheistic thought rather than a later Hellenistic interpolation.
 - Problem addressed: whether Jesus' divine status is original to earliest proclamation or a post-resurrection theological development; whether key titles and sayings entail ontological divinity or merely function/role.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Close exegesis of principal Christological texts (Gospels, Pauline corpus, Hebrews, Johannine literature, early creedal fragments).
 - Historical-linguistic analysis of key terms (Son of God, Lord/kyrios, Messiah/Christ), and their semantic range in Jewish, Greco-Roman, and early Christian settings.
 - Case-by-case rebuttal of reductionist readings (adoptionism, purely functional Christology, late Hellenizing interpolation).
 - The resurrection and vindication motif as the decisive ground for early high Christology: Jesus' vindication by God is read by early communities as revelation of his divine identity.
 - Synthesis: New Testament witness coheres in attributing divinity to Jesus while preserving monotheistic commitments.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages modern critics and scholars: Rudolf Bultmann, E. P. Sanders, John A. T. Robinson-style critics, some arguments from N. T. Wright and Richard Bauckham may be treated in dialogue or comparison; he also addresses popular skeptics (e.g., mythicists).
 - Draws heavily on primary canonical texts, early creedal fragments, Second Temple Jewish literature for background.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (pre-existence, incarnation, exaltation), Trinity (implicitly, via Son-language and divine titles), revelation (Christ as decisive revelation), resurrection/atonement, continuity with Jewish monotheism.

- **Closing line**
 - Carson argues that rigorous exegesis shows the New Testament's Son-language and lordship titles point to an early, coherent high Christology: Jesus is portrayed and confessed as the divine Son within a monotheistic horizon, revealed decisively in resurrection and exaltation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Methodological dualism: combines conservative theological commitments with careful historical-critical exegesis - neither naive literalism nor reductive skepticism.
 - Stresses continuity with Jewish monotheism: high Christology is not necessarily polytheistic or Hellenistic import but can emerge within strict monotheism through divine agency language and vindication motifs.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Pushes back against Bultmannian demythologizing and sociological reductions that treat "divinity" as only functional or honorary.
 - Counters accounts that place full divinization of Jesus late in the tradition; argues for nascent high Christology in earliest strata.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Nuanced treatment of "Son of God" as multi-layered: identity, function, relationship, and vindication marker rather than a single static category.
 - Clarifies the interplay between "kyrios" and monotheism in early Christian worship-language.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used and respected in evangelical seminaries and among conservative New Testament scholars as a go-to defense of New Testament high Christology.
 - Critiqued by some liberal and critical scholars for presuppositional commitments; praised for exegetical thoroughness by others across the spectrum.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of disciplined, text-centered Christological argumentation that integrates historical background with doctrinal clarity; valuable pedagogically for training pastors and scholars in careful Christological exegesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Son of God**
 - Explores semantic range: messianic sonship, royal/servant language, pre-existence and unique filial relationship with the Father.

- **Kyrios (Lord)**
 - Demonstrates how Jewish readers could hear "kyrios" as divine identification (echoing YHWH) when applied to Jesus.

- **Messiah / Christ**
 - Distinguishes political/royal expectations from the NT's suffering-exaltation Christology.

- **Pre-existence**
 - Evidence and implications in Johannine and Pauline texts; used to ground assertions about Jesus' ontological status.

- **Resurrection / Vindication**
 - Central hermeneutical pivot: resurrection as the event that discloses and confirms Jesus' divine identity.

- **Incarnation**
 - Treated carefully: affirms genuine human experience and divine agency without extensive systematic metaphysics.

- **High Christology**
 - Term for New Testament portrayals that attribute divine titles, functions, and worship to Jesus.

- **Monotheism (Second Temple context)**
 - Framework for showing high Christology developed inside a monotheistic matrix, not outside it.

- **Divine agency**
 - Jesus portrayed as God's agent, but agency language often blurred with identity language in early confession.

- **Creedal fragments**
 - Early liturgical confessions used as primary data for earliest high Christological formulations.

- **Exaltation**
 - Theological motif linking resurrection, enthronement, and the attribution of divine prerogatives.

- **Titles and semantic range**
 - Approach: lexical-historical analysis to control anachronistic readings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for evangelical NT Christology (what "Son of God" and "Lord" meant within the NT corpus).
- As a **polemic** against reductionist or late-dating accounts of Christian divinity language.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating disciplined lexical-contextual analysis across Gospels and Paul.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking historical Jesus research with confessional theology (resurrection-centered hermeneutic).
