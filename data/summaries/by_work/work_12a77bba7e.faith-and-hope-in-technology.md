### TITLE
Faith and Hope in Technology - Egbert Schuurman

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century engagement (postwar technological expansion, rise of information/biotech), rooted in the Dutch Reformational philosophical tradition.
 - Schuurman writes as a Christian philosopher/engineer addressing the cultural dominance of technology and the secular assumption of technological neutrality.
- **Central thesis**
 - Technology is never morally or metaphysically neutral; it embodies a vision of the good that must be judged and guided by Christian faith and eschatological hope. Faith supplies normative creational insights; hope orients toward redeemed ends.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: modern technology has achieved cultural autonomy and forms a dominant "technological culture" with its own imperatives and values.
 - Critique: prevailing accounts (technological neutrality, utopian progressivism, and unexamined pessimism) fail to provide adequate moral orientation.
 - Positive constructive move: articulate a theological-ethical framework-drawing on reformational thought-that grounds technology in creational norms, stewardship, imago Dei, and eschatological hope.
 - Practical implications: technology policy, design choices, education and institutional responsibility must be reformed by this theological-ethical lens.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with philosophers of technology (critical dialogue with technological determinism and instrumentalism), echoes themes from Ellul and Heidegger while correcting their emphases.
 - Draws on Reformational thinkers (e.g., Kuyper, Dooyeweerd) for a cosmonomic/creational-normative approach; dialogues implicitly with secular social theorists and engineers.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence (creational norms as moral-linguistic constraints on technological practice).
 - Anthropology (imago Dei and human vocation as technologists/stewards).
 - Eschatology and hope (orientation of technological ends toward renewal rather than domination).
 - Sin and fall (technological dominion can become sinful autonomy and idolatry).
 - Ethics (practical moral responsibility, stewardship, public policy).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Technology must be reoriented by Christian faith and eschatological hope so that technical power serves creational purposes and human flourishing under divine lordship rather than becoming an autonomous idol.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats technology as a moral-cultural phenomenon shaped by worldview commitments, not merely a set of tools or neutral means.
 - Centers **faith** (normative understanding of creation) and **hope** (eschatological telos) as the twin theological virtues necessary to guide technological practice.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against instrumentalist neutrality: technology permeates social structures and morals, so neutrality is a myth.
 - Against techno-pessimists (pure rejection) and tech-optimists (uncritical embrace): advocates critical appropriation guided by creational norms.
 - Modifies Heideggerian existential critique by reintroducing a specifically Christian normative account rather than only ontological analysis.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Reframes technological assessment around creational norms and the idea of technology as "formed" by worldviews-thus operationalizing a theological critique into practical policy and design language.
 - Emphasizes institutional and educational responsibility (not only individual virtue) in shaping technological trajectories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Important in Reformed Christian philosophy and Christian ethics of technology; frequently cited in discussions that seek theological resources for technology critique.
 - Has influenced Christian engineering education, policy-oriented Christian ethicists, and those developing alternatives to secularist accounts of technological development.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust, theologically grounded framework that bridges philosophy of technology and systematic theology.
 - Useful for pastors, ethicists, engineers, and policymakers seeking a non-reductionist, normative account of technology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technology**
 - Not merely tools or techniques; a cultural system embodying values and shaping human practices.
- **Technological culture**
 - The societal matrix in which technological values become dominant and normative.
- **Technological neutrality (critique)**
 - The contested claim that technology is value-neutral; Schuurman rejects this as untenable.
- **Creational norms**
 - God-ordained structures and purposes (ontological and moral constraints) that should orient technological development.
- **Imago Dei**
 - Human dignity and vocation; grounds responsible stewardship and the prudential limits of technological control.
- **Faith (normative function)**
 - Provides the interpretive lens for discerning creational norms and ethical standards for technology.
- **Hope (eschatological telos)**
 - Orients technological ends toward renewal and restoration, resisting domination and idolatry.
- **Technological autonomy / idolatry**
 - When technology claims independent authority and becomes an object of worship or absolute trust.
- **Stewardship / vocation**
 - Human responsibility to shape technology in ways that serve creation and neighbor.
- **Instrumentalism**
 - The view Schuurman critiques as inadequate because it ignores embedded values and purposes.
- **Policy and institutional responsibility**
 - The locus for applying theological critique beyond individual moral judgment.
- **Reformational philosophy**
 - Intellectual tradition supplying Schuurman's modal, creational-normative resources.
- **Ethical-technical judgment**
 - Practical decision-making informed by faith and hope rather than purely economic or instrumental criteria.
- **Public theology of technology**
 - Use: Schuurman supplies a theological vocabulary for public debates on technology, allowing Christians to argue for norms in pluralist settings.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: clarifies "technology" as culturally and morally laden, not neutral.
- As a **polemic**: critiques technological determinism, instrumentalism, and secular technocracy.
- As a **conceptual pivot**: supplies creational-normative categories (faith, hope, imago Dei, stewardship) for ethical evaluation and policy formation.
- As a **teaching resource**: used in Christian engineering, ethics, and philosophy curricula to integrate theology with technology studies.
