### TITLE
Collected Writings on Scripture - D. A. Carson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-early 21st century evangelical scholarly milieu; Carson writes from the anglophone evangelical academy (Trinity Evangelical Divinity School, etc.), addressing postwar debates between liberal historical criticism, fundamentalist apologetics, and emerging canonical/biblical-theology movements (e.g., Brevard Childs, Gerhard Von Rad). The collection gathers essays and lectures produced across decades of New Testament and hermeneutical work.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Scripture must be read and defended as the uniquely authoritative, God-breathed witness to redemptive history; this requires a disciplined exegetical method that honours the text (grammatical-historical and canonical) while allowing biblical theology to inform - not be subsumed by - systematic theology.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes a robust evangelical doctrine of Scripture that resists both liberal reductionism and naïve fundamentalism.
 - Argues for a methodological priority of careful exegesis: close attention to language, genre, historical context, and canonical shape.
 - Advances a **redemptive-historical/canonical** sensibility: theological categories should emerge from the biblical storyline rather than be imposed a priori.
 - Explores the interface of biblical theology and systematic theology, insisting on a two-way relationship: biblical theology supplies the content and contours for systematic reflection, while systematic theology organizes and tests theological claims.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Engages Brevard Childs (canonical criticism), Gerhard von Rad and George Eldon Ladd (biblical-theological approaches), Karl Barth and contemporary dogmaticians on revelation and authority, liberal historical-critical scholars, and conservative defenders of inerrancy (e.g., Chicago Statement interlocutors). Pulls heavily on primary biblical exegesis, classical Protestant confessions, and contemporary evangelical scholarship.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and inspiration, authority and inerrancy (nuanced evangelical formulations), hermeneutics and method, canon and canonicity, biblical theology vs systematic theology, typology and covenantal motifs, Christology as grounded in Scripture, occasionally ecclesiology and mission as scriptural outworkings.
- **Closing line:** Carson's theological center of gravity is a disciplined, text-centered evangelicalism that privileges careful exegesis and canonical/read-the-Bible-as-a-story biblical theology as the indispensable foundation for sound systematic reflection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the methodological primacy of exegesis combined with canonical sensitivity - Scripture must be read as Scripture, with its final form privileged for theological construction.
 - Balanced critique of extremes: rejects both pietistic anti-intellectualism and hypercritical historicism.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Challenges approaches that treat systematic theology as prior to or independent from Scripture; conversely, criticizes approaches that reduce theology to mere historical reconstruction without theological synthesis.
 - Dialogues critically with Brevard Childs: affirms canonical concerns but presses for rigorous historical-critical legitimacy and evangelical theological commitments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of **"biblical theology"** as a bridge term - not merely diachronic history of redemption but a canonical-theological lens that informs doctrine.
 - Emphasizes the distinction and dialogue between **exegetical priority** and **theological systematization**.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential in evangelical seminaries and for pastors who seek a scholarly yet confessional approach to Scripture.
 - Praised for clarity and methodological realism; critiqued by some liberals for confessional commitments and by some fundamentalists for refusing simplistic literalism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** Exemplary model for integrating rigorous exegesis with theological reflection; a go-to resource for modules on hermeneutics, biblical theology, and the doctrine of Scripture.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology:** The study of the Bible's theological message as it unfolds; used by Carson to supply substance and direction for systematic theology.
- **Systematic theology:** The constructive ordering of theological truth; should be informed by, and accountable to, biblical theology.
- **Grammatical-historical method:** Carson's preferred exegetical baseline-attention to grammar, genre, and historical context.
- **Canonical criticism / canonical approach:** Reading the biblical books in their final form and canonical relationships; emphasized as corrective to exclusive historicism.
- **Redemptive-historical:** The notion that Scripture tells a coherent story of redemption; used to resist atomizing texts into disconnected proof-texts.
- **Inspiration / authority / inerrancy:** Affirmed in evangelical terms; Carson nuances discussions to avoid caricatured absolutism while defending robust normative authority.
- **Typology:** Biblical patterns and fulfillments read within the canonical story; a hermeneutical tool connecting OT and NT.
- **Hermeneutics:** Reflective rules and principles for interpretation; Carson insists on methodological humility and methodological rigor.
- **Exegetical priority:** The principle that careful exegesis supplies the materials for theology rather than theology dictating exegetical outcomes.
- **Theological correlation:** The ongoing task of relating biblical data to doctrinal formulations across loci.
- **Authorial intent / text's final form:** Carson stresses both historical authorial meaning and theological significance as fixed in canonical form.
- **Confessional commitment:** The explicit evangelical stance that shapes interpretive commitments and hermeneutical choices.
- **Dialogue with modern criticism:** Carson engages historical-critical tools selectively, integrating useful results while rejecting anti-supernatural presuppositions.
- **Typology vs allegory:** Prefers typology grounded in historical-grammatical sense and canonical fulfillment over free allegorizing.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for evangelical positions on Scripture and hermeneutics.
 - As a **polemic** against both liberal reductionism and simplistic fundamentalism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating grammatical-historical method with canonical and redemptive-historical reading.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking biblical theology to systematic formulation in classroom and pulpit contexts.
