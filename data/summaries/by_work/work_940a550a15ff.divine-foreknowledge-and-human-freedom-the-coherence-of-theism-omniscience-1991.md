### TITLE
Divine Foreknowledge and Human Freedom: The Coherence of Theism: Omniscience (1991) - William Lane Craig

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic theology; part of a renewed interest in reconciling classical theism with libertarian freedom.
 - Craig advances and popularizes a contemporary form of **Molinism (scientia media)** within evangelical and analytic circles.
- **Central thesis**
 - **Middle knowledge (God's knowledge of true counterfactuals of creaturely freedom)** coherently preserves both divine omniscience/providence and libertarian human freedom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes three logical species of divine knowledge:
 - **Natural knowledge**: truths of necessity (what God would know prior to any creative decree).
 - **Middle knowledge**: truths about what free creatures would do in any hypothetical circumstance (counterfactuals of freedom).
 - **Free knowledge**: truths about the actual world God freely chooses to create (what will actually occur).
 - Major moves:
 - Show that middle knowledge is logically prior to God's creative decree yet compatible with God's sovereignty.
 - Use middle knowledge to explain how God actualizes a world containing freely performed actions that He foreknows (thus grounding providence without causal determinism).
 - Respond to objections (e.g., the grounding objection, triviality objection) by defending the intelligibility and metaphysical status of counterfactuals of freedom.
- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Historical: **Luis de Molina** (originator of scientia media), Aquinas and Molinist/Thomist contrasts, Boethius on divine eternity and foreknowledge.
 - Contemporary: Craig positions himself alongside modern Molinists (e.g., Alvin Plantinga in related debates) and explicitly argues against **open theism** (e.g., Greg Boyd, William Hasker) and strict theological compatibilism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Omniscience**, providence, human freedom (libertarianism), divine sovereignty, predestination, and implications for divine simplicity and eternity.
 - Secondary touchpoints: providential governance, prayer and petition, theodicy.
- **Closing line**
 - Craig locates the theological center of gravity in a Molinist synthesis: God sovereignly actualizes a world whose free decisions He timelessly knows via middle knowledge, thereby securing both robust omniscience and genuine libertarian freedom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Clear, analytic defense of **scientia media** as the best reconciliation of classical theism with libertarian free will; emphasizes formal distinction between logical order of knowledge and causal order of decree.
 - Stresses practical theological payoffs: coherent account of providence, prayer, divine foresight, and moral responsibility.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with **open theism** by denying that future free choices are fundamentally unknowable; counters **compatibilist determinism** by insisting on libertarian freedom.
 - Refines Molina by situating middle knowledge within contemporary possible-worlds semantics and analytic metaphysics.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Precise use of triple-knowledge schema (natural / middle / free) in a modern analytic register; systematic deployment of counterfactuals of freedom as central theological data.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major catalyst in the late-20th-century revival of Molinism among evangelicals and analytic philosophers of religion.
 - Provoked sustained debate: defenders embraced it for theological balance; critics pressed the **grounding objection** and debated whether counterfactuals have metaphysical truthmakers.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, rigorous model for teaching the Molinist position; remains a primary reference in courses and debates on divine foreknowledge and freedom.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia media (Middle knowledge)**: God's knowledge of what free creatures would do in any possible circumstance; central to Craig's thesis.
- **Natural knowledge**: God's knowledge of necessary truths and possibilities independent of creation.
- **Free knowledge (knowledge of the decree)**: Knowledge of truths about the actual world God elects to create after His decree.
- **Counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**: Propositions of the form "If person P were in circumstances C, P would freely choose action A"; their truth-value is pivotal.
- **Libertarian freedom**: The view that human choices are not causally determined and are genuinely up to agents; preserved by Molinism.
- **Divine providence**: The governance and ordering of history - in Craig's scheme, achieved by God selecting a world in light of middle knowledge.
- **Grounding objection**: The charge that counterfactuals of freedom lack truthmakers independent of God's decree, undermining middle knowledge.
- **Triviality objection**: The claim that middle knowledge adds nothing substantive if counterfactuals are simply conditionalizations on God's own creative choice.
- **Transworld depravity**: (Plantinga-related term) an explanatory device opposing naive optimism about possible worlds; deployed in debates about whether God could create a world with morally significant free creatures who always choose well.
- **Possible-worlds framework**: Semantic apparatus used to articulate how God evaluates and chooses among potential worlds given middle knowledge.
- **Divine sovereignty vs. human responsibility**: Analytical locus where middle knowledge mediates apparent tension.
- **Omniscience (classical)**: God's exhaustive knowledge, including all three knowledge-species in Molinist reconstruction.
- **Actualization of a world**: The divine act of choosing which possible world (with its known counterfactuals) to instantiate.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for contemporary Molinism and the triple-knowledge schema.
- As a **polemic** against open theism and strict compatibilist accounts of providence.
- As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for integrating biblical texts on foreknowledge, prayer, and providence with analytic metaphysics.
