### TITLE
The Sermon on the Mount (1959-1960) - Martyn Lloyd-Jones

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Expository sermon series preached at Westminster Chapel, London, during 1959-1960. Situated in mid‑20th century Reformed evangelicalism with strong pastoral, revivalist, and Puritanic influences. Reaction against liberal theology and moralistic religion; emphasis on experiential Christianity and the sovereign work of the Holy Spirit.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Sermon on the Mount demands a righteousness that is inward, supernatural, and Christ‑produced; true obedience presupposes regeneration and continuous work of the Spirit, not mere moralism or external conformity.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Lloyd‑Jones treats the Sermon as a unitary sermon of Jesus that reveals the character and ethics of the kingdom.
 - **Beatitudes**: defines the radical, Spirit‑formed disposition of the Christian life.
 - **Antitheses (law reinterpreted)**: Jesus deepens the Mosaic commands to expose heart level sin (anger, lust, oath, retaliation, love of enemies).
 - **Practice of piety**: almsgiving, prayer (Lord's Prayer exposition), fasting - genuine piety must be hidden and heart‑directed.
 - **Kingdom ethics applied**: wealth, worry, judging others, the Golden Rule, the two builders - exhortation to living by kingdom priorities.
 - **Conclusion**: only a new birth and dependence on the Spirit secure the righteousness the Sermon demands.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal interlocutor: Jesus and Matthew 5-7. Frequent engagement with Pauline theology (justification/sanctification), Puritan writers, Calvinist vocabulary, and polemics with liberal moralism, legalism, and superficial pietism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Sanctification** (primary focus), new birth, justification (as definitional background), Scripture as normative revelation, Christology (Lordship of Christ), the Holy Spirit (as the agent of sanctification), ethics and eschatological kingdom ethics.
- **Closing line**
 - The Sermon demands a holiness that is the fruit of regeneration and Spirit‑filled obedience; without new birth the Sermon remains an impossible ideal.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence that the Sermon is not a manual of moral improvement but a portrait of kingdom character produced by conversion and the Spirit.
 - Strong pastoral insistence on experiential Christianity: orthodoxy must be joined to holiness of life.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern moralism (religion as social ethics) and legalism (works without heart change) by insisting on radical inner transformation.
 - Contrasts sentimental, therapeutic, or purely outward forms of piety; also cautious toward ecstatic or sensational expressions of spirituality, prioritizing fruit over manifestations.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the Sermon as the "constitution" of kingdom life - not merely rules but the portrait of those formed by Christ.
 - Treats Beatitudes as progressive spiritual states produced by Spirit‑wrought poverty of spirit, meekness, hunger for righteousness, etc.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Broadly influential among conservative evangelicals and expository preachers; reinforced Reformed pastoral emphases on holiness, preaching, and the necessity of conversion. Used as a corrective in debates over moralism and the charismatic movement.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model of exegetical preaching that integrates doctrine and pastoral application; sustained emphasis on sanctification as theological and practical center of Christian life.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Beatitudes** - character marks of the Spirit‑formed believer (poverty of spirit, meekness, hunger for righteousness, etc.).
- **Antitheses** - Jesus' six "you have heard... but I say" sayings showing law internalized (anger, lust, divorce, oaths, retaliation, love of enemies).
- **Righteousness** - kingdom righteousness that exceeds Pharisaic/legalistic standards; inward and supernatural.
- **New birth / Regeneration** - prerequisite for the Sermon's obedience; central explanatory category for sanctification.
- **Sanctification** - progressive, Spirit‑wrought transformation; Lloyd‑Jones stresses its necessity and supernatural character.
- **Spirit (Holy Spirit)** - primary agent of inward change and holiness; not equated with sensational gifts.
- **Prayer (Lord's Prayer)** - model of kingdom dependence; emphasis on its doctrinal and practical contours.
- **Internalization of law** - law fulfills its goal when it governs the heart rather than only outward action.
- **Kingdom of Heaven** - ethical implications of residing in God's kingdom now; present reality with eschatological orientation.
- **Piety practices (alms, fasting)** - reinterpreted as hidden, heart‑directed acts opposed to ostentation.
- **Golden Rule / Judgment** - ethical reciprocity grounded in love and humility; warns against hypocritical judgment.
- **Two builders (wise/foolish)** - practical testing of authentic discipleship: obedience as evidential.
- **Peacemakers / purity of heart** - moral categories tied to sanctification and spiritual fruit.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for sanctification theology: clarifies that holiness is supernatural, progressive, and rooted in new birth.
 - As a **polemic** against legalism, moralism, and pietistic superficiality.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching kingdom ethics that unites doctrine and pastoral application.
