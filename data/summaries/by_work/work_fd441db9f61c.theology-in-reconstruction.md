### TITLE
Theology in Reconstruction - Thomas F. Torrance

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑20th century project within post‑war Reformed and ecumenical theology; reaction against liberal theology and an attempt to take Karl Barth seriously while reconstructing dogmatics coherently with modern scientific thought.
 - Torrance writes as a Scottish Reformed theologian committed to a realistic epistemology and to bringing theological method into conversation with the natural sciences.

- **Central thesis**
 - Christian theology must be reconstructed as a *scientific* discipline of the knowledge of God grounded in the self‑revelation of the triune God in Christ; theological propositions are true in virtue of a real correspondence with God's reconciling action in history.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Critique of theological liberalism and subjectivism; rejection of purely existential or cultural criteria for truth.
 - Proposal of a theological epistemology modeled on scientific realism: knowledge arises from objective encounter with the divine Word (incarnate and propositional) and is disciplined by coherent correlation with reality.
 - Redeployment of Barthian Christocentrism: the knowledge of God is mediated solely in and through the person and work of Christ.
 - Systematic consequences for doctrine: Trinity as the ontological basis for revelation; Christology as center of dogmatics; soteriology reframed in terms of reconciliation (dealing with guilt, pollution, death); ecclesiology and sacramental theology (means of grace - preaching, sacraments, prayer) as real participations in the reconciling event.
 - Practical theological method: an interplay between dogmatic doctrine and scientific modes of thought, not scientism but disciplined analogies to scientific method.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Close engagement with Karl Barth (affirming Barth's Christocentrism while supplementing his epistemology), sustained critique of liberal theologians (e.g., Ritschlian heirs), dialogue with contemporary scientific thought and with Catholic thinkers (implicit engagement with Rahneric concerns about rule and revelation).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and knowledge of God, Trinity, incarnation, atonement/reconciliation, human sinfulness (guilt, pollution, death), sacramental theology (Word and sacrament as means of grace), ecclesiology, theological method.

- **Closing line**
 - Theology in Reconstruction locates the authority and truth of doctrine in the objective, historical reconciling act of the triune God in Christ, demanding a realist, scientifically disciplined dogmatics that recasts traditional loci around reconciliation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Theology as a scientific, realist discipline: truth is correspondence to divine action rather than mere coherence or existential existentiality.
 - Strongly incarnational metaphysic: ontology and epistemology are shaped by the reality of the Incarnation and the Triune God's self‑communion.
 - Reconciliation as organizing center: atonement reforms the structure of all dogmatic loci.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal theology's subjectivism and nominalistic reductions of doctrine.
 - Receives and refines Barth: affirms Christocentrism but seeks greater methodological clarity and sacramental realism where Barth can appear anti‑institutional.
 - Engages Roman Catholic theological moves (e.g., Rahner) by pressing for a firmer ontological grounding of revelation and a critical assessment of any rule that diminishes the uniqueness of Christ as the decisive Word.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Scientific theology" as a program name - not scientistic, but disciplined, analogy‑sensitive theological method.
 - Recontextualizing classical categories (guilt, pollution, death) within a relational and ontological frame that foregrounds participation in Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Major influence among Reformed and evangelical theologians interested in methodological rigor and in bridging theology with science.
 - Influenced later ecumenical dialogue and revival of sacramental realism and Trinitarian theology across traditions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable methodological model for dogmatics; useful as corrective to both liberal reductionism and fideistic anti‑rationalism; prized in teaching for framing Christocentric systematic theology with disciplined epistemology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientific theology**
 - Theology as disciplined, objective inquiry analogous in form (not content) to scientific realism.
- **Reconciliation**
 - The central theological category organizing doctrine; God's action in Christ restoring relation and reality.
- **Christocentrism**
 - The rule that all divine knowledge and doctrine must be mediated through the incarnate Word.
- **Trinitarian ontology**
 - The triune life of God as the metaphysical ground for revelation and relational being.
- **Incarnational realism**
 - The claim that the Word‑made‑flesh secures the reality to which theological knowledge corresponds.
- **Guilt, pollution, and death**
 - Distinct but related effects of sin treated ontologically and relationally:
 - Guilt - forensic estrangement addressed in atonement.
 - Pollution - corrupted human nature requiring sanctification in union with Christ.
 - Death - ontological consequence overcome in Christ's death and resurrection.
- **Rahner's rule / Barth's reformulation**
 - Rahneric tendencies (general grace/rule) are engaged critically; Torrance follows Barth in insisting on a Christ‑centered reformulation of any epistemic rule for theology.
- **Means of grace (preaching, sacraments, prayer)**
 - Viewed as real participatory practices in which the Word effectuates reconciliation; preaching as event of the Word, sacraments as sacramental participation in Christ, prayer as relational response grounded in divine initiative.
- **Word‑event**
 - The occurrence of God's Word in history as the locus of theological truth.
- **Sacramental realism**
 - Sacraments as real signs/means by which Christians partake in Christ's reconciling action.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **methodological model** for dogmatics (definition source for "scientific theology").
 - As a **polemic** against liberal subjectivism and certain readings of modern theology (Barth and Rahner dialogues).
 - As an **exegetical and sacramental resource** for grounding preaching, sacraments, and prayer in a realist Christology and doctrine of reconciliation.
