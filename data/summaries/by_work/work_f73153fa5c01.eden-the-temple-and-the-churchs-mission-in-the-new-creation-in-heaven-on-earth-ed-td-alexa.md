### TITLE
Eden, the Temple, and the Church's Mission in the New Creation - Gregory K. Beale (in Heaven on Earth, ed. T.D. Alexander & S. Gathercole)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical biblical-theological scholarship (early 21st century); part of a volume aiming to recover biblical hope for creation and embodied eschatology.
 - Situated in Reformed/evangelical canonical and intertextual approaches that seek continuity between OT temple imagery and NT fulfillment in Christ and the church.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Eden narrative functions as a proto-temple account; the biblical storyline moves from Eden-as-temple to the later Israelite temple and finds its consummate fulfillment in Christ and the church as agents and sign-bearers of the restored cosmic temple (new creation). The church's mission is thus priestly-kingly stewardship of the inaugurated new creation.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Identification of literary and cultic markers in Genesis 1-3 that parallel later temple descriptions (sacred space, tree/altar motifs, entrances, priestly tasks).
 - Survey of temple language and typology across the Pentateuch, Psalms, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Second Temple texts to demonstrate continuity.
 - Exegesis of NT texts (esp. Gospel portrayals of Jesus, Johannine and Pauline passages, Revelation) showing Christ as the true temple/high priest and the church as temple-community.
 - Practical-theological move: derives an **eschatological anthropology** - humans are created for priestly-kingly stewardship - and frames the church's mission as restoration and witness to the new creation inaugurated in Christ.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on canonical commentators and temple-oriented interpreters (e.g., Meredith G. Kline's covenant/temple work; canonical criticism exemplars; typological tradition).
 - Interlocutors include N.T. Wright (new creation emphasis), John Walton (functional creation view), and critics who separate Eden and temple motifs or who secularize mission away from cosmic restoration.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and providence; anthropology (imago Dei, vocation); covenant; Christology (fulfillment of temple and priesthood); ecclesiology (church as temple/community); eschatology (inaugurated/new creation); worship and cultus; mission theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Beale centers the theological argument: the Bible maps a continuous temple-Eden-new-creation framework in which Christ's work inaugurates a restored sacred space, and the church's mission is to embody and steward that renewed cosmos as God's priestly-kingly people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic linking of Eden and temple as a single theological-cultic motif running through Scripture to its eschatological consummation.
 - Strong canonical, intertextual method that reads OT-NT typology as structural to biblical theology, not merely allegorical.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters readings that treat Eden as purely "natural" garden or that locate temple motifs only in Israelite cult; argues against mission models that discount cosmic restoration in favor of privatized salvation or purely social ethics.
 - Pushes back on sharp dichotomies between creation order and cultic/ritual language (e.g., some readings of Walton), showing ritual language frames human vocation.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Articulation of **eschatological anthropology**: humans as priestly-kingly stewards whose vocation is realized in the church's participation in Christ's temple-restoration.
 - Use of "temple geography" and typological chain (Eden -> Israelite temple -> heavenly temple/new creation) as a hermeneutical grid for mission.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and evangelical circles as a resource linking biblical theology with mission and ecological concern.
 - Influential in homiletics, missiology, and academic biblical-theological curricula; prompted dialogue with functional-creation interpreters and with social-justice-oriented mission theologians.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust exegetical model for reading the Bible's cosmic storyline; valuable corrective to compartmentalized mission theologies; fertile for teaching on vocation, worship, and creation care.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eden-as-temple** - Genesis portrays Eden with structural/cultic features (entrances, sacred trees, guardian role) that function like a temple narrative.
- **Temple motif / temple typology** - The recurring scriptural pattern where physical temple realities point forward to Christ and cosmic renewal.
- **New creation** - The eschatological consummation in which the cosmos is renewed; not merely moral regeneration but cosmic restoration and sacred space renewed.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - The "already/not yet" framework: Christ inaugurates the new creation while its fullness awaits consummation.
- **Priestly-kingly anthropology** - Humans created to serve as both priests (cultic mediators/guardians) and kings (stewards/rulers) over creation.
- **Cosmic temple / heavenly temple** - The idea that the temple imagery extends to the whole cosmos and is consummated in the heavenly reality described in Revelation.
- **Canonical intertextuality** - Reading texts in their canonical relationships (OT -> NT), tracing fulfillment and typology across Scripture.
- **Cultic geography** - Spatial language (garden, mountain, sanctuary, throne) used to map sacred presence and vocation.
- **Christ as true temple/high priest** - Christ fulfills the temple's role, mediating God's presence and inaugurating the new creation.
- **Church as temple-community** - The gathered people as the embodied sign and instrument of temple restoration and mission.
- **Mission as restoration** - Mission defined as participating in the healing, ordering, and liturgical witness to the new creation.
- **Typological chain** - The hermeneutical link Eden -> Israel -> Christ -> New Creation used to organize biblical meaning.
- **Eschatological anthropology** - Anthropology shaped by the end (telos): human identity and vocation are defined by the destiny of redeemed creation.
- **Worship/ethics convergence** - Liturgical identity and ethical stewardship are intimately connected in mission.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for eschatological anthropology and the temple-Eden typology.
 - As an **exegetical model** for OT-NT continuity in preaching, mission strategy, and ecological ethics.
 - As a **polemic resource** against mission accounts that divorce evangelism from cosmic restoration or reduce vocation to privatized piety.
