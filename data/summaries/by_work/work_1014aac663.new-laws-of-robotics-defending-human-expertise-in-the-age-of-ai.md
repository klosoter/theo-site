### TITLE
New Laws of Robotics: Defending Human Expertise in the Age of AI - Frank Pasquale (2020)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published amid rapid expansion of machine learning and automated decision systems; policy debates on privacy, bias, and regulation intensified after notable algorithmic harms (late 2010s-2020s).
 - Situated at the intersection of law, technology policy, and ethics rather than systematic theology; nevertheless of high interest to theologians working on vocation, stewardship, authority, and public ethics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **Thesis:** In an age when automated systems claim authority, societies must defend the normative role of human expertise by designing legal and institutional constraints on algorithms that preserve human judgment, contestability, and professional responsibility.
 - Implicit theological problem: what becomes of human agency, vocation, and moral responsibility when judgment is delegated to opaque systems?
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnostic stage: documents how contemporary algorithms centralize power, obscure causal chains, and displace expert judgment.
 - Normative frame: proposes a set of "new laws" and governance mechanisms that re-anchor decision-making in accountable human institutions and expertise.
 - Insist on **contestability** and mechanisms for review and redress.
 - Demand **transparency** tailored to epistemic contexts (not simplistic open-source fetish).
 - Preserve **human-in-the-loop** or **meaningful human control** in high-stakes domains.
 - Practical prescriptions: regulatory design, professional norms, auditing infrastructures, and legal liability adjustments that make expertise legible and responsible.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages computer science and legal literatures, policy reports, and prior cultural imaginings of robotics (e.g., Asimovian motifs) as foil.
 - Dialogues indirectly with thinkers about expertise, accountability, and bureaucratic governance.
- **Doctrines treated (theological mapping)**
 - **Anthropology:** human agency, vocation, and fallibility as central to moral ordering.
 - **Ethics/Practical Theology:** responsibility, professional ethics, and stewardship in technological contexts.
 - **Ecclesiology / Public Theology:** institutional mediation of moral judgment; role of communal contestation and repair.
 - **Epistemology / Revelation analogue:** contrasts sources of legitimate knowledge - trained human wisdom vs statistical correlations.
- **Closing line**
 - Pasquale's theological center of gravity: the defense of human expertise as a moral and institutional good that must be preserved through law and governance to sustain human responsibility, dignity, and the common good.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats **expertise** as a normative, juridical good rather than merely an epistemic asset; expertise must be legally protected and institutionally enabled.
 - Moves beyond transparency rhetoric to emphasize **contestability**, auditing pathways, and institutional accountability.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters techno-solutionism that privileges purely technical fixes (e.g., explainable AI as panacea).
 - Contrasts with libertarian or purely innovation-first stances by emphasizing regulatory design and civic judgment.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the problem via the language of **"new laws"** that mirror but depart from Asimov: not about robotic obedience, but about institutional limits and human authority.
 - Emphasizes **meaningful human control**, **contestability**, and **institutionalized expertise** as legal-political terms.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology**
 - Limited direct uptake in systematic theology but significant resonance in public theology, ethics, and vocation studies.
 - Useful resource for Reformed theologians concerned with doctrine of vocation, common good, and ambits of civil responsibility; some traction in interdisciplinary theology-technology conversations.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a robust, policy-oriented case that can be mapped onto theological concerns over human agency, stewardship, and institutional sin/responsibility.
 - Serves as a pragmatic bridge text between abstract theological ethics and concrete regulatory proposals.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **New Laws of Robotics** - Pasquale's proposed legal-institutional rules that bind algorithmic systems to human accountability.
- **Human expertise** - Normative capacity of trained, accountable professionals to make judgment calls that algorithms should not displace.
- **Contestability** - Mechanisms for individuals and institutions to challenge algorithmic decisions; central corrective to opaque automation.
- **Transparency** - Not raw openness but contextualized, meaningful explanations suitable for accountability and auditing.
- **Meaningful human control / human-in-the-loop** - Legal and normative demand that humans retain decisive, reviewable authority in high-stakes decisions.
- **Algorithmic accountability** - Legal and institutional responsibility for harms arising from automated systems; includes liability and remedy structures.
- **Opacity / inscrutability** - Technical and organizational conditions that hide causal chains and diffuse responsibility.
- **Epistemic injustice** - The risk that algorithmic systems misrecognize or marginalize certain knowledges and persons; connects to theological concerns about justice and witness.
- **Auditing and redress infrastructures** - Practical institutional tools Pasquale advocates for ensuring review and correction.
- **Delegation of judgment** - The ethical-procedural problem of offloading moral decisions to machines; theological resonance with sin, vocation, and responsibility.
- **Professional autonomy** - The protected space for experts to exercise conscience and judgment, which Pasquale argues must be preserved legally.
- **Regulatory design** - The law-and-policy techniques proposed to embed the above values into institutions.
- **Privacy and data protection** - Instruments that both protect persons and structure how expertise can access necessary information.
- **Bias and fairness** - Technical and moral concepts addressed in tandem with institutional remedies.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "expertise" and institutionalized human judgment in ethics and public theology syllabi.
- As a **polemic** against technocratic and dehumanizing tendencies in church and civil governance.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on vocation, stewardship, and the interface of theology with technology policy.
- As a **regulatory model** informing pastoral and denominational responses to digital decision-making in welfare, education, and criminal justice contexts.
