### TITLE
Moralizing Technology: Understanding and Designing the Morality of Things - Peter-Paul Verbeek (University of Chicago Press, 2011)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st century STS/philosophy of technology; rooted in postphenomenology (Don Ihde) and Science and Technology Studies (Latour, Akrich), reacting against instrumentalist and deterministic accounts of technology.
 - Aimed at scholars in philosophy, design ethics, and applied moral theory; adopted in interdisciplinary ethics curricula including theology and pastoral ethics.

- **Central thesis**
 - Technologies are not morally neutral tools but actively *mediate* human perceptions, actions, and moral decisions; hence technologies *moralize* - they help shape moral subjectivity and practice. Ethical assessment must therefore include artifacts and design processes, not just human agents.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of two inadequate views: instrumentalism (technology-neutral) and technological determinism (technology fully determines outcomes).
 - Introduction of postphenomenological mediation theory: technologies mediate relations between human beings and the world, altering intentionality and responsibility.
 - Analysis of how specific technologies instantiate moral dimensions (case studies from healthcare, surveillance, ICT).
 - Argument for normative intervention: designers and institutions must take responsibility; propose a framework for *design ethics* that accounts for hybrid moral agency and distributed responsibility.
 - Concludes with practical consequences for policy, design practice, and moral theory.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Don Ihde (postphenomenology), Bruno Latour (actor-network theory), Michel Foucault (technologies of the self/governmentality implicitly), Madeleine Akrich and Langdon Winner (politics of artifacts).
 - Engages contemporary ethicists of technology and designers; dialogues with philosophers concerned with agency and responsibility.

- **Doctrines treated (theologically relevant)**
 - Not a theological treatise, but addresses core moral-theological themes: agency, responsibility, formation of moral subjectivity, sin and complicity (via mediated actions), vocation of designers, and stewardship of created (technical) things.
 - Relevant to ecclesial practices (liturgical technologies), pastoral ethics, and sacramental theology insofar as material mediations shape spiritual formation.

- **Closing line**
 - Technologies co-constitute moral agents and practices; moral theology and ethics must therefore attend to the normative power of artifacts and the obligation to design moral possibilities into the material world.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Focus on *mediation* rather than mere causation: technologies shape how the world appears and how moral choices present themselves.
 - Moves ethics *downstream* into design decisions - normative claims aimed at creators, not only users.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Rejects naïve instrumentalism (technology as neutral) and simple determinism; offers a middle-range account that recognizes contingency and shapeability.
 - Extends Winner's insight that artifacts have politics by providing a phenomenological, micro-level account of how artifacts configure moral perception and behavior.

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Moralizing technology" as a term: artifacts that embody or induce moral norms.
 - Use of "technological mediation" to ground claims about hybrid moral agency (human + artifact) and distributed responsibility.
 - Advocacy of "design ethics" as a practical, normative program for embedding values in artifacts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited across STS, design studies, applied ethics, and increasingly in theological ethics for thinking about liturgy, sacramentality, and pastoral practice.
 - Influential in curricula on technology and theology; used as a bridge between philosophical STS and normative theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust framework for diagnosing moral effects of technologies without falling into determinism.
 - Practical utility for theologians seeking to integrate material culture, formation, and moral responsibility into doctrinal reflection and pastoral praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Technological mediation**
 - Technologies shape perceptions, actions, and understanding; mediation is neither neutral nor fully deterministic.

- **Moralizing technology**
 - Artifacts that imbue action with normative significance by configuring possibilities for action and perception.

- **Postphenomenology**
 - Philosophical stance focusing on human-technology-world relations; foundation for analyzing mediated intentionality.

- **Hybrid moral agency**
 - Moral agency as co-constructed by humans and technologies rather than located exclusively in human subjects.

- **Distributed responsibility**
 - Responsibility spread across designers, institutions, users, and artifacts; challenges individualistic liability models.

- **Design ethics**
 - Normative program recommending the deliberate embedding of values into artifacts during design.

- **Scripts / configuring the user**
 - Concept borrowed from Akrich: artifacts prescribe roles and behaviors, shaping user actions and moral options.

- **Normativity of things**
 - The idea that objects carry and convey normative affordances that guide behavior.

- **Intentionality of artifacts**
 - Not literal intention but the way design channels human intentionality toward certain ends.

- **Value-sensitive design**
 - Practical cousin of Verbeek's thought: design methodologies that incorporate ethical values early in development.

- **Micro-politics of technology**
 - Everyday moral effects instantiated in small-scale interactions mediated by artifacts.

- **Responsible innovation**
 - Policy and practice agenda overlapping with Verbeek: anticipatory, inclusive, and reflexive design processes.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "technological mediation" and "moralizing technology" in moral theology and ethics syllabi.
- As a **polemic** against instrumentalist moral theology that ignores material mediations and institutional design.
- As a **conceptual pivot** toward integrating material culture and design practices into doctrines of agency, sin, and pastoral formation.
- As an **exegetical model** for case studies (healthcare, surveillance, liturgical tech) demonstrating distributed responsibility and the need for ethical design.
