### TITLE
John Bolt, "Bavinck on Common Grace" (secondary)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st century Reformed scholarship reflecting renewed interest in Herman Bavinck (1854-1921). Bolt writes from a contemporary Reformed academic context engaged with Kuyperian and neo-Calvinist debates about culture, apologetics, and the doctrine of grace.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Bolt argues that Bavinck offers a carefully balanced and theologically rich doctrine of **common grace** that preserves the gospel antithesis while accounting for non-saving goods in fallen creation; he also explicates Bavinck's notion of **preparatory grace** as distinct but related to common and saving grace.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exposition of Bavinck's texts on common grace (dogmatics and polemical writings).
 - Distinction of three related senses of grace in Bavinck: **saving grace**, **common (general) grace**, and **preparatory grace**.
 - Theological grounding: covenantal and Trinitarian foundations; relation to revelation (general vs. special) and providence.
 - Practical implications: apologetics, cultural engagement, and ecclesial practice.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary: Herman Bavinck (Dogmatics especially).
 - Interlocutors: Abraham Kuyper (points of agreement and divergence), Dutch neo-Calvinists, earlier Reformed scholasticism, and modern critics who either deny common grace or fear syncretism.
 - Scripture and classic Reformed confessions used as supporting matrix.
- **Doctrines treated:** Grace (types), general revelation, special revelation, providence, noetic effects of sin, covenant theology, church and state (cultural mandate).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Bavinck, as Bolt shows, defends a disciplined doctrine of common and preparatory grace that secures God's sovereignty over both salvation and providential cultural goods while preventing collapse into universalism or theological quietism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Bavinck insists on a **covenantal and Trinitarian grounding** for common grace rather than a merely philosophical or naturalistic account.
 - He frames common grace functionally: it **restrains sin**, **preserves creation**, and **enables cultural development** without effecting justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - More cautious than some Kuyperian formulations about collapsing distinctions between common and saving grace; more robust than critics who deny any non‑saving divine benevolence.
 - Counters pietistic or sectarian views that privatize grace by showing its public, cultural, and providential dimensions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies and rehabilitates **"preparatory grace"** as a category referring to means by which God providentially prepares some to hear the gospel, without making it salvific or universal.
 - Develops a nuanced taxonomy of grace that helps avoid equivocation in polemics.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential in recent Reformed debates on public theology, apologetics, and Christian engagement with culture.
 - Bolt's interpretation has helped revive Bavinck as a corrective to polarizations in neo-Calvinist circles.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provides a model for integrating dogmatics, biblical theology, and cultural theology.
 - Useful pedagogically for showing how a confessional Reformed theologian handles the tension between God's common benevolence and particular redemption.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common Grace:** God's non-saving favor shown to all creatures: restrains sin, preserves creation, and enables cultural goods.
- **Preparatory Grace:** Providential ways God prepares certain individuals or contexts to receive the gospel without guaranteeing salvation.
 - Distinct from prevenient grace (not a universal salvific impulse) and from saving grace (effectual).
- **Saving Grace:** The particular, effectual work of God in election and sanctification leading to salvation.
- **Antithesis:** The fundamental Reformed concept of the moral and spiritual divide between regenerate and unregenerate; Bavinck preserves this while allowing common goods.
- **General Revelation:** Knowledge of God through creation and conscience that is genuine but impaired by sin.
- **Special Revelation:** Christ and Scripture; the unique basis for salvation, distinct from common grace.
- **Restraining Grace:** Aspect of common grace whereby God limits the full eruption of sin for societal order.
- **Covenant Theology:** Bavinck's framework: common grace operates within God's covenantal governance of creation.
- **Noetic Effects of Sin:** The epistemic corruption that limits the saving power of general revelation.
- **Providence:** God's sustaining governance that works through natural means to produce cultural goods and potential gospel opportunities.
- **Cultural Mandate:** The mandate to steward creation; Bavinck uses common grace to account for non-Christian contributions to culture.
- **Kuyperian Comparison:** Useful contrast-shared commitments but Bavinck is more careful about theological boundaries.
- **Public Theology:** Field that uses Bavinckian common grace to justify Christian engagement with civic life without compromising gospel particularity.
- **Apologetics:** Bavinck's account supports a restrained apologetic that appeals to general revelation and cultural commonalities while pointing to Christ.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for disciplined distinctions among types of grace.
 - As a **polemic and corrective** against both universalizing and privatizing tendencies regarding grace.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual model** for public theology, apologetics, and the Reformed approach to culture.
