### TITLE
The Use of Daniel in Jewish Apocalyptic Literature and in the Revelation of St. John (1984) - Gregory K. Beale

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Dissertation-era study (early academic formation of Beale in the 1980s) within a Reformed-evangelical scholarly milieu. Emergent interest in canonical and intertextual readings of the New Testament; reaction to literalist/futurist readings of Revelation.
 - Part of a larger turn toward Old Testament intertextuality in NT interpretation that Beale later consolidates in his Revelation commentary (1999/2018).

- **Central thesis**
 - **Revelation draws its eschatological framework and specific imagery for Revelation 20 (the millennium) primarily from Danielic apocalyptic motifs**, so Revelation 20 should be read in light of Danielic typology and symbolism rather than as a literal chronological portrait of a future earthly thousand-year reign.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establish the prevalence of Danielic material in Jewish apocalyptic literature as the cultural-linguistic matrix for later revelation traditions.
 - Demonstrate structural and verbal correspondences between Daniel and Revelation across motifs: judgment scenes, enthronement language, resurrection, temporal phrases (e.g., symbolic periods), beasts/horns imagery.
 - Apply this intertextual map specifically to Revelation 20:
 - The binding of Satan is read against Danielic adversary motifs and the vindication of God's kingdom.
 - The "thousand years" functions symbolically within Jewish numeric symbolism and apocalyptic chronology rather than as literal, sequential history.
 - The "first resurrection" and final judgment are patterned on Daniel 12's dual-resurrection and vindication language.
 - Conclude that Revelation 20 participates in a typological/recapitulative apocalyptic logic, portraying the inaugurated reign of Christ and the present-eschatological restraint of Satan until the final consummation.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Jewish apocalyptic corpora and Danielic texts as primary sources; engages contemporary interpreters of Revelation and Daniel, and interlocutes with premillennial/dispensational and literalist interpreters.
 - Uses comparative philology, verbal parallel lists, and canonical-theological hermeneutics.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (millennium, resurrection, final judgment)
 - **Christology** (kingly/priestly reign of the Son)
 - **Revelation / Scripture** (OT use in NT; canonical intertextuality)
 - Angelology / demonology (Satan's role and restraint)
 - Hermeneutics (typology, allusion, intertextual method)

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Revelation 20 is best understood as a Daniel-shaped, typological portrayal of Christ's inaugurated reign and the present-but-not-yet restraint of evil, not as a straightforward literal chronology of a future earthly millennium.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Puts Daniel at the center of New Testament apocalyptic reception, not merely as a background motif but as the primary structural matrix for interpreting Revelation 20.
 - Prioritizes canonical-intertextual hermeneutics over isolated verbal-exegesis or proof-texting.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges premillennial and dispensational readings that treat Revelation 20 as literal chronological reportage.
 - Counters methods that minimize OT literary dependence in favor of novel, NT-only symbolism.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic mapping of Danielic motifs onto Revelation's structure as an interpretive methodology for apocalyptic literature.
 - Emphasis on recapitulation/typological time rather than linear chronological sequencing in apocalyptic narrative.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Became a foundational study for Beale's later canonical-intertextual approach; influential among Reformed and conservative evangelical interpreters advocating non-literal readings of the millennium.
 - Cited in subsequent commentaries and debates over the millennium, especially by scholars arguing for inaugurated eschatology and symbolic readings of numeric periods.

- **Enduring value**
 - Robust exegetical model for OT use in NT, particularly for teaching Revelation 20 and defending amillennial/inaugurated eschatological readings.
 - Serves as an exemplar for combining philological parallels with theological-canonical interpretation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Intertextuality** - method that reads Revelation in light of Danielic texts as a single apocalyptic conversation.
- **Allusion / verbal parallel** - evidence strategy: repeated language, imagery, and structure linking Daniel and Revelation.
- **Typology / recapitulation** - apocalyptic time is patterned and covenant-typical rather than strictly chronological.
- **Thousand years (millennium)** - treated as symbolic/eschatological period; denotes consummation-inauguration motif, not necessarily a literal temporal span.
- **Binding of Satan** - read against Danielic adversary motifs; marks restraint of evil during Christ's inaugurated reign.
- **First resurrection** - partial, eschatological vindication of the righteous; analogized with Daniel 12's promise of deliverance.
- **Danielic motifs** - beasts, horns, judgment-at-court, enthronement, resurrection language as shaping Revelation's scenes.
- **Symbolic periods (time, times, half a time / 42 months / 1260 days)** - numeric symbolism inherited from Danielic chronology and used non-literally.
- **Inaugurated eschatology** - kingdom already begun in Christ and the church, awaiting consummation; central hermeneutical presupposition.
- **Canonical reading** - reading Revelation as part of the unified Scriptures, with the OT as normative referent.
- **Anti-dispensational polemic** - implicit critique of literal-futurist chronology common in dispensationalism.
- **Hermeneutical priority of OT** - Beale gives OT typology priority in decoding NT apocalyptic.

How this work is used across loci:
- As an **exegetical model** for tracing OT allusion and thematic dependence in NT apocalyptic.
- As **polemic** against literalist/futurist interpretations of Revelation 20 (especially dispensational premillennialism).
- As a **definition source** for the symbolic and typological reading of the millennium within Reformed and evangelical eschatology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** for arguing inaugurated eschatology and canonical theology in NT interpretation.
