### TITLE
**Biblical Theology: Old and New Testaments** - Geerhardus Vos (posthumous, 1948). A classic of Reformed, redemptive-historical biblical theology from the Old Princeton milieu.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Lectures distilled at Princeton Theological Seminary (late 19th-early 20th c.), published 1948.
 - Engages German critical scholarship while defending Reformed orthodoxy; allied with Old Princeton (Warfield) and Dutch Calvinism (Kuyper, Bavinck).
- **Central thesis**
 - **Special revelation unfolds progressively and organically in history**, climaxing **eschatologically in Christ** and the **Spirit**, so that Scripture is the inspired record and instrument of that redemptive history.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: defines **biblical theology** as a historical discipline tracing revelation through epochs, distinct yet harmonious with systematic theology.
 - OT: from **Edenic revelation** and the protoevangelium; **patriarchal promise** (seed, land, blessing); **Mosaic theocracy** (law, tabernacle, priesthood, kingship, sacrificial system); the **prophetic movement** (ethics, cult, promise of new covenant and Spirit); exile and restoration hopes.
 - NT: ministry of Jesus and the **Kingdom of God**; death and resurrection as once-for-all redemptive events; **Pentecost** as eschatological gift; **Apostolic interpretation** (Paul, Hebrews, Johannine) articulating union with Christ, Spirit, church, and consummation.
 - Integrative motifs: **covenant** (works, grace, new), **typology** (tabernacle-temple, priest-king), **eschatology** (two ages; already/not yet), and **pneumatology** (the Spirit as the power of the age to come).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Resources: Calvin, Reformed orthodoxy, Cocceian federal history; converses with Weiss and Schweitzer on kingdom/eschatology; critiques Wellhausen and Ritschl.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology** (revelation, inspiration in history), **Theology Proper** (economy of Father-Son-Spirit), **Christology** (Second Adam, federal headship), **Pneumatology** (Spirit in revelation and redemption), **Covenant theology**, **Soteriology** (historia salutis grounding ordo salutis), **Eschatology** (inauguration-consummation), **Ecclesiology** (people of God across covenants).
- **Center of gravity**
 - The **eschatological communion with God** secured by the **Second Adam** within history and **applied by the Spirit** to the covenant people.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Eschatology precedes and frames soteriology**; the goal (Sabbath-glory) was embedded in creation.
 - **Organic, epochal unity** of Scripture; revelation grows like a living organism.
 - **Typology anchored in history**; symbol and rite are God-ordained pointers, not allegory.
 - **Theocracy**: Israel as a symbolic, provisional manifestation of divine kingship.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against **source-critical fragmentation** (Wellhausen): insists on canonical coherence and divine authorship.
 - Against **moralistic or merely experiential religion** (Ritschl): centers on God's redemptive acts in history.
 - Refines proof-texting by a **redemptive-historical hermeneutic**; challenges dispensational separations of Israel and church.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies **historia salutis / ordo salutis** relation.
 - Integrates **two-age schema** with covenantal structures; robust **kingdom** and **Spirit** focus.
 - Highlights **Sabbath-eschatology** and creation-eschatology linkage.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Seedbed for Westminster tradition (Machen, Murray; later Kline, Gaffin); shapes Ridderbos, Beale, and evangelical biblical theology.
 - Catalyzes **redemptive-historical preaching** and Reformed covenantal exegesis.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a **macro-hermeneutic** uniting OT and NT; a grammar for typology and kingdom.
 - Serves doctrinal synthesis across loci while remaining **exegetically tethered**.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **History of Special Revelation**: God's progressive self-disclosure in redemptive acts and words recorded in Scripture.
- **Progressive Revelation**: epochal development from promise to fulfillment without contradiction.
- **Organic Unity**: Scripture's living coherence; parts grow from and serve the whole Christ-centered plot.
- **Historia Salutis / Ordo Salutis**
 - HS: once-for-all redemptive events in Christ.
 - OS: Spirit's application of those benefits to believers.
- **Covenant of Works**: Adam under probation with eschatological Sabbath goal.
- **Covenant of Grace**: one saving covenant administered through successive epochs, culminating in the **New Covenant**.
- **Theocracy**: Israel as an institutional manifestation of God's kingship, typological and provisional.
- **Kingdom of God**: dynamic reign breaking in with Christ; central to Jesus' proclamation and apostolic theology.
- **Two-Age Schema**: this age vs the age to come; in Christ the age to come is already present.
 - **Already/Not Yet**: inaugurated fulfillment awaiting consummation.
- **Typology and Symbolism**: God-ordained historical patterns (temple, priesthood, sacrifices) that prefigure Christ.
- **Federal Headship / Second Adam**: Christ represents and secures destiny for his people, rectifying Adam's failure.
- **Union with Christ**: believers participate in Christ's death-resurrection by the Spirit; HS grounds OS.
- **Spirit as Eschatological Gift**: Pentecost as down payment of new creation power.
- **Prophetic Eschatology**: OT prophets project a Spirit-filled, righteous kingdom realized and advanced in Christ.
- **Sabbath-Eschatology**: creation's goal of consummate rest fulfilled in Christ and consummation.

- **How this work is used**
 - **Definition source** for biblical theology, typology, and covenantal epochs.
 - **Exegetical model** for redemptive-historical preaching and canonical synthesis.
 - **Conceptual pivot** linking soteriology to eschatology via HS-OS and two-age framework.
 - **Polemic resource** against atomism, moralism, and anti-covenantal readings.
