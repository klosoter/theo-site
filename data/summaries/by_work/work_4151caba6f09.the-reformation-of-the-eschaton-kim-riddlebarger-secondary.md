### TITLE
The Reformation of the Eschaton (Kim Riddlebarger, secondary) - reading the Three Forms of Unity into Reformation eschatology; focus: Millennial Views

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century engagement: a historically informed evangelical/Reformed corrective to popular premillennial and dispensational readings.
 - Theological milieu: Reformation and post-Reformation confessional Reformed theology (emphasis on the Three Forms of Unity) brought to bear on contemporary eschatological controversies.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformers and the confessional Reformed tradition (as embodied in the Three Forms of Unity) recover a biblical, covenantal, inaugurated eschatology that rejects both medieval chiliastic distortions and modern dispensational premillennialism. The proper Reformation eschaton is the present reign of Christ with final consummation at the Parousia rather than an intervening earthly thousand-year kingdom.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical reconstruction: key millennial texts (Revelation 20; Daniel; eschatological sayings of Jesus) are read in their covenantal and typological horizons, yielding non-literal/typological readings of the millennium.
 - Theological integration: covenant theology (continuity of the two ages, Christ as the center of fulfillment) explains the "already/not yet" shape of the kingdom.
 - Ecclesial and sacramental implications: sacraments and the church's life are signs and seals of the inaugurated kingdom; they point forward to consummation while participating now in Christ's reign.
 - Polemic: critiques of dispensational premillennialism and optimistic postmillennialism for divorcing biblical promise structure from covenantal promise-fulfillment.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Reformers (esp. Calvinian streams), authors of the Three Forms of Unity (Belgic Confession, Heidelberg Catechism, Canons of Dort) as representatives of confessional Reformed eschatology.
 - Modern interlocutors: dispensational premillennialists, postmillennial advocates, and recent popular eschatological treatments; selective engagement with modern Reformed scholars who defend inaugurated eschatology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (millennium, Parousia, resurrection, final judgment)
 - Covenant theology (already/not yet, continuity of promise)
 - Christology (Christ's present reign and mediatorial kingdom)
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments (signs/seals of the kingdom)
 - Scriptural authority and hermeneutics (typology vs. literalism)

- **Closing line**
 - The work situates the Reformation/confessional Reformed position as theologically coherent and biblically faithful: Christ's kingdom is already present in the church and sacraments and will be consummated at the Parousia, not by an intervening earthly millennium.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Readiness to place the Three Forms of Unity (often treated doctrinally rather than eschatologically) at the center of a contemporary eschatological hermeneutic.
 - Strong integration of covenantal typology with New Testament consummation language-minimizes literalist readings of Revelation 20.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects dispensationalism by stressing covenantal continuity (no radical Israel/Church divide) and by reinterpreting prophetic promises as fulfilled in Christ and the church.
 - Rejects optimistic postmillennialism's confidence in cultural triumphs as constitutive of the millennium, instead affirming the present-but-not-yet tension.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes the millennium not as a chronological future epoch but as a theological description of Christ's present, spiritual reign expressed covenantally and sacramentally.
 - Emphasizes the Three Forms of Unity vocabulary (promise/fulfillment, visible/invisible church, sacramental pledge) as hermeneutical keys.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Found receptive ears among confessional Reformed pastors and teachers seeking historical grounding against dispensationalism.
 - Used as a bridge text for evangelicals sympathetic to historic Reformed readings of eschatology; less persuasive to committed premillennial audiences.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how confessional Reformed theology handles prophetic and apocalyptic texts without resort to modern dispensational categories.
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical resource for teaching the covenantal, inaugurated shape of Reformed eschatology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism**
 - Interprets Revelation 20 typologically; denies a future earthly thousand-year reign as a separate chronological epoch.
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom is both already present (in Christ and the church) and not yet consummated (awaits Parousia).
- **Already/not yet**
 - Central hermeneutical grid: present reality vs. future consummation of redemption.
- **Millennium (the "thousand years")**
 - Read as symbolic/typological of Christ's present mediatorial reign, not as literal chronology.
- **Covenant theology**
 - Framework for continuity of promise: fulfillment in Christ, inclusion of the church as true Israel in promise-fulfillment.
- **Parousia**
 - Eschatological climax: bodily return of Christ that will consummate the new heavens and new earth.
- **Two ages**
 - Present evil age and age to come; governs New Testament soteriological and ethical teaching.
- **Typology**
 - Method for reading Old Testament promises as Christ-fulfillment patterns, not merely predictive scripts.
- **Sacraments as pledges**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper are present signs/seals of the kingdom's reality and future hope.
- **Chiliasm**
 - Historical term for millenarian expectations; Riddlebarger distinguishes Reformation anti-chiliasm from earlier medieval variants.
- **Dispensational premillennialism**
 - Critiqued for its Israel/Church split and literalist prophetic hermeneutic.
- **Realized eschatology**
 - Emphasizes present fulfillment elements; balanced here with future consummation.
- **Consummation / new heavens and new earth**
 - Final eschatological hope at the Parousia, not a prolonged earthly golden age beforehand.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for confessional Reformed/inaugurated eschatology in classroom introductions.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational premillennial readings of Revelation and prophetic literature.
 - As an **exegetical model** for covenantal-typological readings of apocalyptic passages.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking sacramental theology and ecclesiology to eschatological claims.
