### TITLE
Faith and Rationality: Reason and Belief in God (co-edited with Alvin Plantinga, 1983) - Nicholas Wolterstorff (co-editor)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Early 1980s analytic philosophy of religion; immediate context is the rise of **Reformed Epistemology** and a broader challenge to classical evidentialism. The volume collects interlocutors within analytic epistemology, philosophy of religion, and theology to confront the rational status of religious belief.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Can belief in God be rational and warranted without being strictly evidentially supported? The volume frames the problem as whether religious belief requires propositional evidence to be rational, or whether it can be **properly basic** and warranted in other epistemic ways.
- **Core argument / structure:** A multi-author, dialogical collection; major argumentative moves recurring across essays:
 - Critique of **evidentialism** (the claim that justification requires evidence proportional to belief).
 - Defense of **properly basic beliefs** about God - beliefs that do not depend on inferential evidence but can be rationally held.
 - Introduction and elaboration of **warrant** (Plantinga's central notion) as the key to moving from true belief to knowledge; emphasis on cognitive faculties functioning properly in an appropriate epistemic environment.
 - Consideration of **defeaters**, internalist concerns, and the role of religious experience and testimony in grounding belief.
 - Dialogues about internalist vs. externalist models of justification and the consequences for Christian epistemology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Alvin Plantinga (warrant, proper function), proponents of Reformed Epistemology, critics from evidentialist and analytic traditions. Implicit interlocutors include classical evidentialists (e.g., W. K. Clifford), standard internalist epistemologists, and philosophers of religion addressing religious experience and testimony.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and religious experience as sources of belief; epistemic status of faith; the interplay of reason and revelation; indirect engagement with soteriology insofar as belief/knowledge of God matters for Christian faith.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The collection advances a sustained defense of the thesis that belief in God can be rational and warranted without classical evidentialist proofs, relocating theological epistemology toward proper-function and properly basic accounts.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Moves the debate from "justification" in a narrow internalist sense to broader notions of **warrant** and cognitive proper function.
 - Treats religious belief as potentially **non-inferentially warranted** - not mere fideism, but a structured epistemic stance with criteria.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Challenges **evidentialism** (Clifford-style) by arguing that demanding proportional evidential proof for religious belief is unwarranted and excludes other legitimate epistemic routes.
 - Contrasts classical foundationalism by enlarging what counts as a basic foundation (religious experience, sensus divinitatis).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Popularized and diffused Plantinga's technical vocabulary (notably **warrant**, **proper function**, **properly basic belief**) across theology.
 - Fostered clearer demarcation between **justification** (internalist tradition) and **warrant** (externalist tilt).
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Catalyzed growth of Reformed Epistemology as a major current in analytic theology.
 - Provoked extensive critical engagement from evidentialists and internalists; became a staple text in courses on philosophy of religion and Christian epistemology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a primary source for understanding the shift away from strict evidentialism and for introducing analytic tools to theological epistemology.
 - Useful as a conference-style exemplar: multiple perspectives, sustained engagement with philosophical standards, and application to theological claims.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Reformed Epistemology:** The view that belief in God can be rationally basic and not inferentially justified; cluster of positions advanced by Plantinga and allies.
- **Evidentialism:** The thesis that rational belief must be proportioned to the evidence; a primary target of critique in the volume.
- **Properly Basic Belief:** A belief that is rationally held without inferential support (e.g., perceptual beliefs; extended here to belief in God).
- **Warrant:** Plantinga's term for the quality that, when added to true belief, yields knowledge; central alternative to classical justification.
- **Proper Function:** The idea that cognitive faculties must operate as they were designed to in an appropriate environment to produce warrant.
- **Sensus Divinitatis:** The theological-epistemic notion (a la Calvin) of an innate faculty or disposition to perceive God, appealed to as a ground for properly basic belief.
- **Defeaters:** Information or considerations that undermine warrant or justification; treated extensively to show limits and conditions on warranted religious belief.
- **Internalism vs Externalism:** Ongoing debate concerning whether justification depends on internally accessible states (internalism) or can depend on external factors like proper function (externalism).
- **Religious Experience:** Treated as potentially epistemically significant and possible bearer of warrant when properly construed.
- **Testimony and Community:** Considered as sources that can support or undermine warrant for religious claims.
- **Foundationalism (rethought):** The volume re-evaluates foundationalist intuitions by expanding what counts as a foundation.
- **Epistemic Rationality:** Recast to include externalist criteria and non-inferential grounding for religious belief.
- **Polemic use:** The book is often cited as the canonical defence against evidentialist critiques of faith.
- **Pedagogical use:** Employed as a primary text for courses on epistemology of religion and analytic theology.
- **Conceptual pivot:** Serves as a turning-point citation for moving debates from evidential sufficiency to questions about warrant and proper function.
