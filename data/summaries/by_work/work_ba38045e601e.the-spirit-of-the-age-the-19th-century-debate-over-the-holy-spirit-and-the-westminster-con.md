### TITLE
The Spirit of the Age: The 19th Century Debate Over the Holy Spirit and the Westminster Confession - J. V. Fesko

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Focuses on 19th-century anglo-american and scottish contexts where evangelical revivalism, the rise of historical-critical methods, and confessional Presbyterianism collided.
 - Key movements: revivalism (e.g., Charles Finney), early charismatic currents (e.g., Edward Irving, Catholic Apostolic movement), the Keswick/Higher Life and Holiness streams, and the conservative Princeton school (Charles Hodge, B. B. Warfield).
 - Polemical backdrop: disputes over conversion, assurance, sanctification, and charismatic gifts; institutional anxieties about discipline and identity in confessional churches.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Fesko argues that 19th-century debates over the Holy Spirit both exposed and reshaped how the Westminster Confession was read and applied: the Confession functioned as a theological touchstone that could be invoked to repel perceived excesses (emotionally driven revivalism, charismatic claims) while also being reinterpreted to account for legitimate experiential claims of the Spirit.
 - The problem: how to maintain confessional orthodoxy (Word-centered, sacramental, covenantal) while accounting for living, often controversial, experiences of the Spirit.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey of major disputes and actors across Britain and North America.
 - Examination of how leading confessional theologians read specific Confessional loci (pneumatology, assurance, sacraments, conversion).
 - Analysis of competing hermeneutics: normative confessional reading (Word-first) vs. experientialist reading (immediate Spirit witness).
 - Assessment of outcomes: doctrinal consolidation, disciplinary measures, and lasting interpretive legacies within Reformed churches.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Charles Finney and New Measure revivalists; Edward Irving and the early charismatic movement; Thomas Chalmers, Scottish evangelical leaders; Charles Hodge and B. B. Warfield (Princeton); Keswick and Holiness proponents; denominational courts and confessional documents (Westminster Confession as interpretive center).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Pneumatology (role, gifts, witness, sanctification)
 - Assurance of salvation and subjective experience
 - Revelation and the authority of Scripture vs. claimed direct Spirit revelations
 - Ecclesiology and discipline (how churches adjudicated claims)
 - Sacramental theology (Spirit's role in baptism and Lord's Supper)
 - Covenant theology as interpretive framework

- **Closing line**
 - Fesko locates the theological center of gravity in a confessional Reformed attempt to hold the primacy of the Word and covenant means of grace while denying nothing essential about the Spirit's experiential and sanctifying work.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reception-historical method: reads the Westminster Confession not as inert text but as a living adjudicator in controversies about the Spirit.
 - Focus on intra-Reformed negotiations rather than a generic history of revivalism.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Challenges simplistic narratives that cast the Confession as uniformly cessationist or pietistic; shows nuanced uses of confessional language to affirm both normative Word-centered theology and robust pneumatological experience.
 - Contrasts Princeton anti-experientialism with revivalist experiential claims and shows how neither pole represented the whole Reformed conversation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Confessional pneumatology" - a term suggesting the way confessions mediate between doctrine and experience.
 - Emphasizes "hermeneutics of ecclesial prudence" - how courts and pastors applied theological rules to pastoral crises.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued in Reformed studies for clarifying how confessions functioned pastorally and polemically in the modernizing church.
 - Cited by those tracing genealogies of contemporary Reformed attitudes toward charismatic gifts and assurance.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful corrective to caricatures of Reformed anti-experientialism; supplies a model for reading confessions dynamically.
 - Helpful for pastors, historians, and theologians navigating modern pneumatological disputes from a confessional standpoint.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession** - central documentary standard; Fesko traces its invocation in 19th-century disputes about the Spirit.
- **Pneumatology** - study of the Holy Spirit; treated historically and doctrinally with attention to gifts, witness, and sanctification.
- **Confessional pneumatology** - Fesko's label for how confessional norms shape reception of Spirit-related claims.
- **Continuism / Cessationism (implicitly treated)** - debates over ongoing charismatic gifts vs. their cessation; 19th-century positions prefigure later 20th-century disputes.
- **Assurance of salvation** - contested locus where subjective experience and objective means (Word, sacraments) were weighed.
- **Revivalism / New Measures** - practical-theological catalyst; Finney's methods provoke confessional responses about the Spirit's agency.
- **Princeton theology** - exemplifies a conservative, Word-centered response emphasizing normative rational and confessional criteria.
- **Edward Irving / Catholic Apostolic movement** - early charismatic interlocutors whose claims forced confessional adjudication.
- **Keswick / Higher Life** - sanctification movements that test confessional boundaries between imputed and imparted righteousness.
- **Word and Spirit relation** - recurrent hermeneutical question: primacy of Scripture vs. claims of immediate Spirit-led revelation.
- **Ecclesial discipline** - how presbyteries and assemblies used the Confession to regulate charismatic or revival excesses.
- **Means of grace** - sacraments and preaching as normative loci of Spirit-work, a key Reformed corrective to unregulated experience.
- **Reception history** - methodology: tracing how the Confession functioned in real controversies.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for "confessional pneumatology" and Reformed hermeneutics concerning the Spirit.
 - As a **polemic resource** in contemporary debates (to defend Word-centered normative theology against unchecked experientialism).
 - As an **exegetical-reception model** for courses on confessional theology, church history, and pastoral responses to charismatic claims.
