### TITLE
Herman Bavinck, On Theology (ed. John Bolt). Selected essays on theological method and dogmatics; emphasis here on **Theological Method: Principia - Theology as Science**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Turn of the 20th century Dutch Reformed context; Bavinck (1854-1921) writing as part of neo-Calvinist and confessional reaction to nineteenth‑century liberalism, rationalism, and pietistic anti-intellectualism.
 - John Bolt's modern edition collects essays addressing the nature, sources, and method of theology for church and academy.

- **Central thesis**
 - Theology is a genuine **scientia** (systematic science) grounded in divine revelation: it is both intellectually rigorous and normatively rooted in Scripture and the Spirit's testimony. Theology's principles (principia) are revealed norms, not merely human constructions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Definition: theology as the science of God and his works, distinct in subject-matter and method from natural science.
 - Sources and principia:
 - Primary principium: **special revelation** (Scripture) as normative and binding.
 - Secondary principia: general revelation, reason, tradition, and church confession-each in ordered relation to Scripture.
 - Method: historical-exegetical attention to texts, systematic organization (dogmatics), dialectical engagement with philosophy, and pastoral application.
 - Epistemology: faith and reason cooperate; the Holy Spirit secures theological certainty without eliminating rational argument.
 - Distinctions: theologia revelata vs theologia naturalis; theology proper vs apologetics; dogmatics vs practical theology.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Reformed confessional tradition (Heidelberg Catechism, Belgic Confession), Kuyperian neo-Calvinism, and critics from Schleiermacherian liberalism, Enlightenment rationalism, and historical-critical approaches.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), Scripture (authority and infallibility), epistemology of faith, method and systematics (dogmatics), the relation of theology to philosophy and science, and ecclesial use of doctrine.

- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck's theological center of gravity: faithful, critical, and systematic theology is a disciplined scientia anchored in revelation and shaped for the church's witness and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Balanced integration of faith and reason**
 - Firmly confessional yet intellectually open: reason is servant, not master; the Spirit ensures access to truth without abolishing rational argument.

- **Principia as normative foundation**
 - Emphasizes a hierarchical ordering of theological principles with Scripture as decisive norm-an ordered pluralism of sources.

- **Corrective to contemporaries**
 - Against Schleiermacher: theology is not reducible to religious feeling.
 - Against rationalists and critics: revelation is epistemically authoritative and historically intelligible.
 - Against pietistic anti-systematic tendencies: defends systematic dogmatics as ecclesially necessary.

- **Methodological clarity**
 - Advances precise categories (revelata/naturalis, principia, scientia) and insists on historical-exegetical discipline within systematic construction.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in Reformed seminaries and neo-Calvinist circles; modern revival via Bolt's edition has shaped recent methodological debates and renewed interest in classical Reformed dogmatics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for confessional theologizing that is both academically respectable and ecclesially accountable; valuable for teaching theological method and the relation of doctrine to praxis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Principia** - foundational norms for theology; Scripture is the first principium, with reason, tradition, and general revelation ordered beneath it.
- **Scientia (theology as science)** - theology conceived as systematic, disciplined knowledge of God grounded in revelation.
- **Theologia revelata** - revealed theology; content derives from special revelation (Scripture).
- **Theologia naturalis** - natural theology; legitimate but subordinate, speaks to God from creation and reason.
- **Scripture (authority / infallibility)** - decisive norm; interpretive principle determining theological truth and method.
- **Faith and reason** - cooperative epistemic relation; faith presupposes and fulfills reason without irrationalism.
- **Dogmatics / Systematic theology** - ordered exposition of Christian doctrine built from principia and historical texts.
- **Historical-exegetical method** - attention to textual-historical context as indispensable for sound dogmatics.
- **Confessionalism** - theology practiced within the church's creedal boundaries; confessions mediate principia.
- **Apologetics vs. theology** - apologetics defends grounds; theology organizes and applies revealed truth.
- **Revelation (special / general)** - dual-source epistemology; special revelation norms theology, general revelation provides common ground with culture.
- **Analogy and language of God** - theological speech is analogical, grounded in Scripture but intelligible to reason.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - Definition source: authoritative sketch for defining theology as a disciplined science within Reformed theology.
 - Polemic: a primary resource against theological liberalism, rationalism, and anti-intellectual pietism.
 - Methodological pivot: used as a template in curricula for integrating exegesis, history, and dogmatics under confessional principia.
