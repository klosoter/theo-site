### TITLE
Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation - Geerhardus Vos

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Princeton-Reformed milieu; Vos shaped by continental historical scholarship but committed to confessional Reformed theology.
 - Written as a methodological manifesto for doing theology from Scripture's unfolding life rather than from abstract dogmatics; originally lectures and essays later collected and circulated in the Princeton tradition.
- **Central thesis**
 - Scripture must be interpreted through the lens of **redemptive history (heilsgeschichte)**: revelation unfolds in concrete historical acts and promises culminating in Christ, and biblical theology should describe that development before systematic theology formulates timeless doctrines.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Distinguishes **biblical theology** (historical, diachronic, descriptive) from **systematic theology** (synchronic, synthetic, dogmatic).
 - Biblical theology traces the progressive disclosure of God's saving acts and promises across redemptive time.
 - Systematic theology extracts, orders, and applies doctrines from that historical development.
 - Emphasizes **Christocentric continuity**: Old and New Testaments are organically united by promise-fulfillment and typology centered on Christ.
 - Methodological insists on reading texts within their redemptive-historical context (grammatical-historical plus canonical-historical sensitivity).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with German historical-critical approaches (implicitly correcting their synchronic, secularizing tendencies), older allegorical medieval/exegetical habits, and contemporary Reformed dogmatics.
 - Draws on Scripture as primary source, using covenantal categories from Reformed theology.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture (authority, organic unity)
 - Covenant theology (promise, fulfillment; covenant of grace)
 - Christology (centrality of Christ in typology and fulfillment)
 - Soteriology (doctrines like active/passive obedience, regeneration framed by historical acts)
 - Ecclesiology implicitly through covenant and promise-fulfillment motifs
- **Closing line**
 - Vos's theological center: **doctrine must be rooted in the historical progression of redemption; only by reading Scripture redemptively does one produce faithful, Christ-centered theology.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence on *diachronic, historical description* as the primary first move of theological method; theology begins with the historical revelation, not with abstract categories.
 - Strong defense of the **organic unity** of Scripture against both fragmentation (dispensationalism) and ahistorical dogmatism.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal historical criticism by refusing to reduce revelation to merely human history; revelation is historical but authoritatively God-breathed and teleological.
 - Opposes both allegorical interpretation that severs texts from history and systematics that impose a priori schemas without attending to redemptive development.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Systematic articulation of **redemptive-historical method** as distinct from other hermeneutical approaches; formalizes promise-fulfillment and typology as methodological categories.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for 20th-century Reformed biblical theology; crucial influence on later scholars (Princeton stream, Dutch redemptive-historical homiletics).
 - Provided the theological justification for covenantal readings that resist dispensational compartmentalization.
- **Enduring value**
 - Remains a primary methodological resource for exegetes, homileticians, and systematicians seeking a historically sensitive, Christ-centered hermeneutic rooted in Reformed confessionalism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Redemptive history (heilsgeschichte)**
 - The unfolding of God's saving acts and promises in concrete historical events culminating in Christ.
- **Biblical theology**
 - A descriptive, historical discipline tracing revelation's development across Scripture.
- **Systematic theology**
 - A synthetic, normative discipline that formulates doctrines based on the historical material biblical theology supplies.
- **Christocentric interpretation**
 - Reading all Scripture in light of Christ as promise and fulfillment; typology and fulfillment patterns center on him.
- **Progressive revelation**
 - The concept that divine truth is disclosed stepwise; later Scripture clarifies earlier stages.
- **Organic unity of Scripture**
 - The view that Scripture forms a coherent, historically ordered whole united by redemptive purpose.
- **Typology / promise-fulfillment**
 - Method for locating correspondences between redemptive events, persons, and institutions across epochs.
- **Covenant (covenant of grace; covenantal framework)**
 - The structural motif that orders biblical history and links soteriological developments.
- **Diachronic method**
 - Emphasis on historical sequence and development as primary hermeneutical lens.
- **Analogia fidei vs analogia entis**
 - Vos aligns with interpreting Scripture by the analogy of faith (internal scriptural coherence) rather than appealing to ontological analogies that equate creaturely being with divine being.
- **Active and passive obedience; federal headship**
 - Doctrines read and grounded within the redemptive-historical narrative of Christ's work on behalf of believers.
- **Regeneration and effectual calling**
 - Treated as historical acts within the economy of redemption rather than abstract metaphysical states.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a **definitional source** for what "biblical theology" properly is and how it differs from systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against dispensational fragmentation and ahistorical dogmatism.
 - As an **exegetical model** for preaching and teaching that insists on redemptive-historical context and Christ-centered interpretation.
