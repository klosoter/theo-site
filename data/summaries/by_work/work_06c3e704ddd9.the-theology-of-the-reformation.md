### TITLE
**The Theology of the Reformation - B. B. Warfield**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Princeton School, late 19th / early 20th century Reformed orthodoxy; Warfield writes as historian-systematician defending classical Protestantism against modernist and Roman Catholic revision.
 - Aimed at recovering the doctrinal nucleus of the Reformation (Lutheran and Reformed) for confessional Protestantism and seminary instruction.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Reformation restored the biblical doctrine of salvation by grace alone through faith alone, anchored in a forensic, covenantal understanding of sin, righteousness, and divine law; departures (Romanism, semi-Pelagianism, modern liberalism, and later innovations) obscure this center.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical survey: key Reformers (Luther, Calvin, Zwingli, Bucer) and their doctrinal loci.
 - Systematic reconstruction: justification, imputation, original sin, divine sovereignty, and covenant structure.
 - Polemic: refutation of Pelagian and semi-Pelagian tendencies; defense of total depravity and total inability; affirmation of covenantal distinctions (works/grace).
 - Practical and confessional implications: how Reformation theology undergirds creeds and confessions.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Martin Luther, John Calvin, the early confessions (Westminster, Heidelberg, Belgic), Augustine as the theological ancestor.
 - Opponents addressed: Pelagianism, Semi-Pelagianism, Roman Catholic scholasticism, Arminian tendencies and (as later readers apply Warfield) Federal Vision / monocovenantal critiques.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Original sin and human inability; forensic justification and imputation; covenant of works and covenant of grace; divine election and effectual calling; sacraments in confessional context; authority of Scripture and revelation.
- **Site usage: five topical touchpoints emphasized**
 - Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism / Augustinianism
 - Total Depravity and Total Inability
 - Covenant of Works
 - Federal Vision / Monocovenantalism (as later polemic reader-response)
 - Confessional formulations of covenant (e.g., Westminster, Belgic)
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield locates the theological center of gravity of the Reformation in a sovereign, forensic, covenantal gospel that alone preserves biblical righteousness, grace, and the church's confessional faithfulness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong synthesis of historical exegesis and dogmatic clarity: Warfield insists the Reformation is both a recovery of Scripture and a coherent systematic corrective.
 - Priority of forensic language: justification as a legal declaration, not merely moral transformation.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived Romish merit-theory and sacramental-cum-works understandings of salvation.
 - Opposes Pelagian and semi-Pelagian mitigations of sin and human will; rejects reductionist pietism that eviscerates forensic righteousness.
 - Anticipates later critiques of monocovenantal readings (e.g., Federal Vision) by defending distinct covenants and imputation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies the relation between **covenant** language and forensic categories: covenant of works as juridical preface to covenant of grace; precise use of **imputation**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in conservative Reformed and Presbyterian circles; formative in Princeton theology and mid-20th century neo-Calvinist defenses.
 - Used as a primary resource against liberal reinterpretations and as a historical-theological model for teaching Reformation doctrines.
- **Enduring value**
 - Teaches students how to read Reformers sympathetically but critically, linking historical theology to systematic loci; remains a go-to polemical and pedagogical resource for covenantal and soteriological studies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pelagianism**
 - Denial of original sin's incapacitating effects; Warfield treats it as the classical foil to Reformation anthropology.
- **Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Partial affirmations of human initiative in salvation; Warfield diagnoses it in some post-Reformation compromises and modern pietistic tendencies.
- **Augustinianism**
 - The theological lineage (doctrine of grace, predestination) Warfield identifies as the necessary backbone of authentic Reformation thought.
- **Total Depravity**
 - Human nature affected in every dimension by sin; Warfield uses it to rebut any doctrine that preserves unaided human ability to effect salvation.
- **Total Inability**
 - Complement to total depravity: humans morally unable to seek God without divine regeneration; central to Warfield's argument against semi-Pelagianism.
- **Covenant of Works**
 - The pre-fall legal covenant binding obedience to life; Warfield affirms it as necessary to make sense of the fall and need for a covenantal redeemer.
- **Covenant of Grace**
 - God's promise of salvation fulfilled in Christ; Warfield emphasizes its forensic and federal character, distinct from but related to the covenant of works.
- **Imputation (of Adam's guilt / of Christ's righteousness)**
 - Juridical transfer: Adam's guilt explains original sin; Christ's righteousness is reckoned to believers-core of Reformation soteriology.
- **Forensic Justification**
 - Declarative act of God pronouncing sinners righteous; Warfield's central legal category for salvation.
- **Federal Theology**
 - Framework pairing covenants with representative heads (Adam/Christ); Warfield employs this to systematize doctrines of fall, election, and atonement.
- **Monocovenantalism / Federal Vision**
 - Modern theological movements that blur covenant distinctions; Warfield's schema is often used to critique these as departures from classical distinctions.
- **Confessional Formulations (Westminster, Belgic, Heidelberg)**
 - Foundational doctrinal summaries that Warfield appeals to for normative Reformed covenantal and soteriological formulations.
- **Effectual Calling / Efficacious Grace**
 - Divine action that results in conversion; Warfield insists on God's sovereign initiative against any synergistic model.
- **Original Sin**
 - Inherited corruption and guilt; Warfield insists both legal and ontological dimensions must be held.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for classical Reformation soteriology and covenant theology.
 - As polemic ammunition against Pelagian, semi-Pelagian, Arminian, and monocovenantal/Federal Vision departures.
 - As an exegetical-model exemplar for Pauline doctrines (imputation, justification) integrated into confessional theology.
 - As a conceptual pivot in teaching the juridical-covenantal unity of Reformation doctrine.
