### TITLE
**De Veritate (Disputed Questions on Truth)** - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Paris, c. 1256-1259, during Aquinas's first regency. Scholastic disputation genre amidst the Aristotelian revival (via Avicenna/Averroes) and Augustinian theological inheritance.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** What is truth, where does it inhere, and how do intellect, language, and God relate to truth? Aquinas argues that truth is primarily in the intellect as **adequation of intellect and thing**, secondarily in things as measurable by intellect, and supremely in God as **First Truth**.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - **Truth and the transcendentals:** **Ens et verum convertuntur**; truth follows being but specifies its knowability and measure.
 - **Location of truth:** Primarily in the intellect (especially in judgment, compositio et divisio); things are true insofar as they are knowable; speech is true insofar as it signifies true judgments.
 - **God and ideas:** God is Truth itself; created truths participate in and are measured by the **divine ideas** (exemplar causality). God's knowledge is the cause of things, not derived from them.
 - **Human knowing:** From sensible phantasms, the agent intellect abstracts **species intelligibiles**; truth culminates in judgment. Error is privation in judgment, not in sense as such.
 - **Language and signification:** The **verbum mentis** (inner word) expresses intelligible content; spoken words signify inner words and thus have truth by ordered signification.
 - **Faith, revelation, and grace:** Faith assents because of **God's veracity**; the act of faith terminates not in propositions but in the **res** revealed (DV 14.2: actus credentis non terminatur ad enuntiabile sed ad rem). Gifts like prophecy and wisdom presuppose and elevate intellect by a **lumen** beyond the natural.
 - **Christological and pneumatological lines:** Christ as the **Word** and **Truth** grounds exemplar knowledge; the Spirit gives the light of faith and gifts that perfect knowing and speaking truth in the Church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Aristotle (Posterior Analytics, De anima), Augustine (illumination, exemplarism), Avicenna/Averroes (intellect theory), Boethius, Pseudo-Dionysius; Scripture (John 1; 14:6; 17:17).
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and Scripture, divine attributes (truth, knowledge), Trinity (Word/Truth), creation and providence (ideas/exemplarism), Christology (Truth/Word; knowledge), Pneumatology (illumination, gifts, prophecy), ecclesial teaching and assent, faith and salvation.
- **Closing line:** God as First Truth is the measure of all intellects; all creaturely truth is participatory, grounding both metaphysics and the economy of revelation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Truth as transcendental** convertible with being, yet formally logical as in intellect.
 - Classic formula: **veritas est adaequatio intellectus et rei** (nuanced by participation and measure).
 - **Primacy of judgment** for truth; simple apprehension lacks truth/falsity strictly.
 - **Faith's terminus in res**, not mere enunciables; triad **credere Deum / credere Deo / credere in Deum**.
 - **Verbum mentis** as analogical ground for the Son as Word.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against strong Augustinian illuminationism: affirms robust **natural intellect** and abstraction while retaining a higher lumen for faith and prophecy.
 - Against Averroist monopsychism and skepticism: safeguards personal intellect and the attainability of truth.
 - Against voluntarist reductions: **truth** belongs formally to intellect; will's role is in assent and love, not constituting truth.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Measure/measured** (mensura/mensuratum) relation: God as measure, creatures as measured.
 - **Exemplar causality** via divine ideas; **participation** account of created truth.
 - Distinctions of lights: **lumen naturale**, **lumen fidei**, and gratiae for gifts.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Reformed scholastics (e.g., Polanus, Turretin, Mastricht) use Aquinas for divine veracity, analogical predication, and the nature of faith; modern Reformed dogmatics (Bavinck, Muller) often cite DV 14.2.
 - Catholic theology standardizes the adequation account and DV's faith analysis; modern analytic theology mines his judgment-centered epistemology.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A unified grammar linking ontology, epistemology, and dogmatics.
 - Conceptual tools for inerrancy, Christ as Truth, the Spirit's illumination, and ecclesial teaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Veritas (truth):** Adequation of intellect and thing; primarily in intellect, secondarily in things, eminently in God.
- **Adequatio intellectus et rei:** Formal definition of truth; governs epistemology and semantics.
- **Ens et verum convertuntur:** Truth is coextensive with being, specifying its intelligibility.
- **Measure/Measured:** God as the measuring Truth; creaturely truths measured participations.
- **Compositio et divisio (judgment):** Seat of truth/falsity; beyond simple apprehension.
- **Species intelligibilis:** Impressed form enabling understanding; basis for inner word.
- **Verbum mentis (inner word):** Expressed concept; analogical basis for the Son as Word.
- **Participatio:** Creaturely share in divine perfections, including truth.
- **Divine ideas (exemplars):** Creatures are made according to ideas in God; grounds order and knowability.
- **Veracitas Dei:** God's truthfulness; grounds revelation's certainty and Scripture's inerrancy.
- **Falsitas as privation:** Error lies in judgment lacking conformity to reality.
- **Lumen naturale / lumen fidei:** Natural light of intellect vs. infused light for faith/gifts.
- **Fides; credere Deum/Deo/in Deum:** Content, authority, and teleology of faith distinguished.
- **Actus credentis... ad rem:** Faith's act terminates in the thing, not mere propositions.
- **Analogia (of truth/predication):** Affirms similarity-in-greater-dissimilarity between God and creatures.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - **Bibliology:** Ground for inerrancy, inspiration, and the relation of literal sense to divine truth.
 - **Christology:** Christ as Truth and Word; template for discussing Christ's knowledge and revelation.
 - **Pneumatology:** Account of illumination, prophecy, and the gifts perfecting intellect and witness.
 - **Soteriology/Ecclesiology/Covenant:** Nature of saving faith and ecclesial assent; divine veracity undergirds covenant promise and sacramental sign-res relations.
