### TITLE
The Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) - Calvinist formulation of Reformed orthodoxy; historically produced by the Westminster Assembly (not literally by John Calvin) but heavily shaped by **Calvinian** theology and vocabulary.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English/Scottish Reformation milieu; Westminster Assembly (1643-1649) convened under Parliament to unify doctrine and polity.
 - Reaction to Anglican theology, Arminian tendencies, and continental confessions; intent to provide a comprehensive Reformed standard for church and academy.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate a coherent system of Christian doctrine grounded in Scripture that secures the doctrine of **justification by faith alone** and the corporate, covenantal structure of salvation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic chapters moving from Scripture and God to covenant, fall, Christ, salvation, sacraments, and church/order.
 - Major moves:
 - Scripture as sole authority for faith and life (chap. 1).
 - Total depravity and federal headship leading to the necessity of divine grace (chaps. 6-9).
 - Christ as mediator and the ground of justification; **forensic imputation** of Christ's righteousness to the believer (chaps. 8-12).
 - Covenant theology: covenant of works (pre-fall), covenant of grace (post-fall) structures redemptive history.
 - Application of salvation through effectual calling, adoption, sanctification, perseverance, and final glorification.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Influenced by Calvin, Beza, and later Reformed scholastic synthesis; countermovement to Arminians, Roman Catholics, and emerging sects.
 - Engages classical Protestant loci and some reactions to Jesuit casuistry and Anglican episcopal formulations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture), God, Trinity, predestination, original sin, covenant, Christology, atonement, justification (forensic), sanctification, sacraments, church polity.
- **Closing line**
 - The Confession is a conciliar Calvinist synthesis that makes **forensic imputation and covenantal headship** the theological hinges of soteriology and corporate piety.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Explicit and sustained articulation of **double imputation**: our sin imputed to Christ and His righteousness imputed to us; justification as a legal, declarative act.
 - Strongly covenantal framing that locates personal salvation within federal headship and covenant promises.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Sharp corrective to Roman sacramentalism and merit-based frameworks; contrasts with Anglican via insistence on sola fide and presbyterial polity.
 - More systematic and juridical than some earlier Reformed summaries; sharper on predestination and divine sovereignty than many contemporaries.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Polished technical vocabulary for forensic categories (e.g., "justification", "imputation", "alien righteousness") and precise definitions for covenantal relations.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for English-speaking Reformed churches, Presbyterianism, Reformed confessionalism worldwide; primary textbook for ministers and catechists across centuries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical matrix for teaching Reformed soteriology, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology; still central in debates over justification, imputation, and covenant theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification (forensic)** - a legal declaration by God that the sinner is righteous because of Christ's righteousness imputed to them.
- **Imputation / double imputation** - the forensic exchange: our sin counted to Christ; Christ's obedience counted to believers.
- **Alien righteousness** - righteousness that is not inherent but reckoned to the believer from Christ.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace** - twofold covenantal structure organizing pre- and post-fall relations between God and humanity.
- **Federal Headship** - Adam and Christ as representative heads whose actions are legally effective for others.
- **Union with Christ** - ground for application of benefits (faith, justification, sanctification) though often treated juridically in the Confession.
- **Effectual calling / Election** - God's sovereign, efficacious calling rooted in eternal election, producing faith and perseverance.
- **Sanctification** - progressive work of the Spirit distinct from justification but inseparable in the believer's life.
- **Assurance of Grace and Salvation** - pastoral doctrine grounded in faith and evidences of sanctification.
- **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture as authoritative rule for faith and practice.
- **Means of grace** - Word, sacraments, prayer as God-ordained channels of effectual blessing.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP) - critique** - modern scholarly challenge that reads Paul covenantally/communalistically and disputes traditional forensic readings of justification.
 - NPP charges: Westminster's forensic emphasis over-contextualizes Pauline soteriology; underplays covenantal participation and works of the law as ethnic boundary markers.
 - Reformed counters: Confession roots forensic language in broader covenantal and Christological commitments; double imputation remains exegetically and pastorally central.
- **Original Sin / Total Depravity** - human inability to attain righteousness without divine grace.
- **Forensic vs. Transformative** - tension: Confession insists on forensic declaration while also affirming necessary transformative sanctification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for classic Reformed formulations of justification, imputation, and covenant.
- As a **polemic tool** against Roman Catholic soteriology, Arminian mitigations, and contemporary NPP claims-both cited in defense and critiqued.
- As an **exegetical model and pedagogical skeleton** for preaching, catechesis, and seminary curricula on Reformed systematic theology.
