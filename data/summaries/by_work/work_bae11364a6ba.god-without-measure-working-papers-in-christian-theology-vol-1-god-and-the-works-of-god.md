### TITLE
God Without Measure: Working Papers in Christian Theology, Vol. 1: God and the Works of God - John Webster

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** early twenty-first-century Anglican/Reformed theological renewal; part of Webster's program of "working papers" aimed at constructive dogmatics. Engages the retrieval of classical and Reformation dogmatic resources while dialoguing with Karl Barth, medieval scholasticism, and contemporary analytic and evangelical debates about divine attributes.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** theology must speak of God primarily through the unity of God's being and works as disclosed in revelation; talk of divine attributes must avoid abstracting God from the triune life and the economy of redemption. The problem addressed is the disjunction in modern theology between "absolute" accounts of God's being and "relative" accounts of God's relations to creation.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Critique of a two-tiered or merely metaphysical account of attributes that isolates "absolute" properties of God from God's redemptive actions.
 - Positive proposal: attribute-talk is anchored in God's self-revelation and works; attributes are to be understood in relation to the triune life (perichoresis) and the economy, without collapsing immanent and economic theology.
 - Detailed treatments illustrating how doctrines (creation, providence, Christology, Trinity) provide the canonical grammar for speaking of attributes.
 - Methodological insistence on the primacy of Scripture and the church's doctrinal vocabulary as corrective to abstract metaphysics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (critique and appropriation), Thomas Aquinas and the scholastic tradition (retrieval and qualification), Augustine, Calvin, contemporary analytic theology and process theology as interlocutors for debates about divine simplicity, immutability, and relationality.
- **Doctrines treated:** doctrine of God (attributes, simplicity, infinity, aseity, immutability), Trinity (economy/immanence), revelation, creation and providence, Christology (God's self-disclosure in the incarnate Word), theological method (revelation as normative).
- **Closing line:** Webster presses a dogmatic center of gravity: Christian theology must treat God's infinity and freedom as disclosed in divine acts-especially in Christ-so that attributes function as revelatory, relational, and doxological, not as static metaphysical predicates.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that attribute-talk is primarily *actional* and revelatory rather than merely predicative; God is known by deeds.
 - Balance between affirming classical metaphysical categories (simplicity, aseity) and refusing their detachment from the Trinity and economy.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Corrects scholastic tendencies to reify attributes as separable qualities by re-rooting them in Scripture and the triune life.
 - Diverges from some modern analytic theology by refusing to privatize God into a set of logically necessary properties independent of redemptive history.
 - Affirms Barthian priority of revelation but recovers more of the classical metaphysical vocabulary than Barth sometimes allowed.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Moves the conversation from a stark absolute/relative dichotomy to a relationally integrated account: attributes are neither purely immanent nor merely ad extra but intelligible only within the unity of God's being and action.
 - Emphasizes the phrase "without measure" as both metaphysical infinity and as the unabating gratuity of God's self-giving.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely read in Reformed and Anglican academic circles; influential in contemporary systematic theology for reorienting attribute-talk toward the economy and Trinity.
 - Cited by constructive theologians seeking a covenantal, scripturally anchored account of God that nonetheless takes doctrine seriously.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Provides a disciplined corrective to both abstract metaphysics and reductive relationalism.
 - Valuable for courses in the doctrine of God, for those reconstructing dogmatics from Scripture and creedal tradition, and for ecumenical dialogue about classical and modern accounts of divine attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God without measure:** shorthand for God's infinity and gratuitous self-giving; theological program to avoid quantitative or bounded conceptions of God.
- **Absolute attributes:** properties traditionally ascribed to God as such (simplicity, aseity, immutability); Webster insists on their intelligibility only via revelation.
- **Relative attributes:** attributes describing God's relations to creatures (faithful, merciful, provident); treated as disclosure of the absolute without being ontologically separable.
 - Contrast: Webster resists treating these as two autonomous sets; they are mutually interpretive.
- **Divine simplicity:** classical claim that God's attributes are identical with God's being; Webster affirms the doctrine but qualifies metaphysical abstractions by the economy.
- **Divine freedom:** stress on God's spontaneity and gracious initiative; freedom is not arbitrary but rooted in God's triune will.
- **Economy/Immanence (economy/ontology distinction):** distinction between God as known in actions and God in himself; Webster integrates rather than compartmentalizes these loci.
- **Revelation as normative:** Scripture and the incarnate Word are the canonical lens for speaking of attributes.
- **Triune life / perichoresis:** anchors attribute-talk in the inner life of God; relationality of persons gives intelligibility to God's actions.
- **Works of God:** creation, providence, redemption as primary loci where attributes are disclosed and tested.
- **Theological grammar:** Webster's notion that doctrine provides the language rules for speaking about God rightly.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; retained but read through relational revelation.
- **Immutability / impassibility:** affirmed cautiously - keyed to God's faithfulness and steadfastness rather than frozen immobility.
- **Attributes as relational:** interpretive move to read attributes as ways in which God's one being is expressed toward creatures.
- **Canonical grounding:** insistence that doctrine be rooted in Scripture and ecclesial confession rather than abstract metaphysics.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for integrating classical attribute-talk with a Christocentric, trinitarian economy.
 - As a polemic against both reductive analytic accounts and detached scholastic abstractions.
 - As an exegetical-model resource for reading biblical predicates of God within systematic dogmatic frameworks.
