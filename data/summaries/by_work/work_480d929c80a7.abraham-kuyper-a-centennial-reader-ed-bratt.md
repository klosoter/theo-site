### TITLE
**Abraham Kuyper: A Centennial Reader** (ed. James D. Bratt)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th c. Dutch Neo-Calvinism; Kuyper as pastor, journalist, university founder, and Dutch Prime Minister.
 - The Reader (Eerdmans, 1998) marks the centennial of Kuyper's 1898 Stone Lectures, curating key essays on doctrine, church, culture, and politics.
 - Milieu: post-Enlightenment secularization, higher criticism, democratization, socialism, and confessional pluralism in the Netherlands.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How can Reformed faith address modern life as a comprehensive life-system under Christ's kingship, guided by Scripture and empowered by the Spirit, without collapsing church, state, and culture into each other?
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Calvinism as life-system: Christ's lordship over every square inch; grace restores nature.
 - Dual grace: **common grace** preserves and cultivates culture; **special grace** saves and reforms.
 - **Sphere sovereignty**: differentiated God-ordained spheres (family, church, state, school, science, art) with proper competencies and limits.
 - Word and Spirit: **organic inspiration** of Scripture and the Spirit's **palingenesis** (regeneration) shape knowledge, piety, and culture.
 - Church as **organism** and **institute**: a worshipping, disciplined body that also diffuses life in society through lay vocation.
 - Principled pluralism: protect conscience and institutional freedom in a diverse public square.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive: Augustine, Calvin, Groen van Prinsterer; resonance with Bavinck.
 - Critical engagements: Enlightenment rationalism, Kant and historicism, Darwinist reductionism, liberal Protestantism, Anabaptist withdrawal, statist socialism, and Roman Catholic hierarchy.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Bibliology: revelation, organic inspiration, self-authenticating authority.
 - Pneumatology: regeneration, illumination, sanctification, church and cultural renewal.
 - Soteriology: election, particular grace, conversion, the antithesis with sin.
 - Theology Proper: divine sovereignty, providence, lordship of Christ.
 - Covenant Theology: creation mandate, family and education, ecclesial life.
 - Eschatology: kingdom and consummation, cultural life under hope.
- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity: the sovereign Triune God, through the Word and the Spirit, orders distinct spheres so that grace restores nature and Christ claims every inch of creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Sphere sovereignty** as a structural principle of creation and society.
 - **Common grace** as theological ground for cultural development and cooperation.
 - **Antithesis** clarifying irreducible spiritual conflict within a shared culture.
 - **Organic inspiration** linking Scripture's divine authority with living historical form.
 - Church as **organism/institute** balancing gathered worship with dispersed vocation.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against secular neutrality and liberal Protestant accommodation; against Anabaptist world-flight; against state absolutism and ecclesiocracy.
 - Nuanced alternative to Lutheran two-kingdoms and Roman nature-grace hierarchy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Life-system or worldview; palingenesis; principled pluralism; spheres; noetic effects of sin; pluriformity of the church.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Catalyzed Dutch Neo-Calvinism; influenced Bavinck, Dooyeweerd, Vollenhoven, Van Til.
 - Shaped Reformed education, journalism, and Christian democratic politics.
 - Debated in North American Reformed circles: common grace controversies; transformationalism vs. two-kingdoms; religious freedom and pluralism discourses.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - A compact gateway to Kuyper's corpus, grounding public theology in classic Reformed doctrines.
 - Usable across loci: Scripture, Spirit, salvation, church, culture, and eschatological hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sphere sovereignty**: God-ordained differentiation of societal spheres with proper autonomy under divine law; resists totalizing states or churches.
- **Common grace**: God's preservative and cultural-enabling favor to all; checks sin and fosters arts, science, and civic life.
 - Distinct from special grace that saves the elect and renews creation in Christ.
- **Antithesis**: spiritual conflict between regenerate and unregenerate; explains worldview divergence and ethics amid shared culture.
- **Organic inspiration**: Scripture's divine-human concursus; canonical unity with historical particularity; basis for authority and lively exegesis.
- **Palingenesis**: regeneration by the Spirit; epistemic and moral renewal grounding Christian scholarship and sanctification.
- **Life-system (worldview)**: Calvinism as comprehensive principle integrating doctrine and cultural practice.
- **Church as organism vs. institute**: dispersed life and cultural vocation vs. gathered worship, discipline, and Word-sacrament ministry.
- **Pluriformity of the church**: recognition of denominational diversity under Christ, short of relativism.
- **Principled pluralism**: public order that protects conscience and institutional freedom across confessions.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: sin's corruption of reason; denies neutral rationality, necessitating Word-Spirit renewal.
- **Cultural mandate**: creational call to cultivate the world, reframed by common and special grace.
- **Sovereignty of God**: comprehensive divine rule; theological root of Kuyper's program.
- **Providence**: God's governance of history; grounds patience, hope, and political modesty.
- **Kingdom of God**: already-not-yet horizon directing cultural labor toward consummation.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a definition source for sphere sovereignty, common grace, antithesis, and organic inspiration.
 - As a conceptual pivot in pneumatology (regeneration and illumination) and bibliology (authority and canon).
 - As a theological basis for public ethics and political theology within covenant and eschatological frames.
 - As a synthetic map linking Reformed soteriology to culture, mission, and institutional design.
