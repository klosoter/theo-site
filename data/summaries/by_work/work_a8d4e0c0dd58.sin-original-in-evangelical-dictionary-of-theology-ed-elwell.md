### TITLE
Sin, Original - Anthony Hoekema (Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, ed. D. A. Carson)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical reference work (Evangelical Dictionary of Theology, 1984 edition). Hoekema writes from a Dutch Reformed / evangelical milieu attentive to both classical Reformed formulations and contemporary pastoral-theological concerns.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Original sin comprises three interrelated consequences of Adam's fall: **guilt (forensic imputation), pollution/corruption (inherited depravity), and death (mortality)**. These must be held together to account for human culpability, pervasive sinfulness, and existential mortality; only Christ as the second Adam rectifies them.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Definition and biblical roots: traces the doctrine primarily to Paul (Romans 5, 1 Corinthians 15) and Old Testament presuppositions about human solidarity.
 - Articulation of threefold result:
 - **Guilt**: Adam's transgression is **forensically imputed** to his descendants (legal standing before God).
 - **Pollution/corruption**: human nature is **depraved and bent toward sin**-a moral and ontological consequence transmitted to posterity.
 - **Death**: both spiritual alienation and physical mortality enter human experience as penalty and consequence.
 - Transmission models discussed:
 - **Federal (representative) headship**: Adam as covenant head whose act binds his progeny.
 - **Realism/seminal headship**: biological/ontological transmission (Augustinian seed view).
 - Hoekema defends the classical Reformed emphasis on federal headship while recognizing scriptural and theological overlap with realism.
 - Soteriological implications: original sin necessitates Christ's representative obedience and atoning death; original guilt is removed by imputation of Christ's righteousness.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Augustine (formulator of seminal and forensic emphases), Calvin (federal covenantal reading), Pelagius and semi-Pelagian critiques, Eastern Orthodox perspectives (ancestral sin as condition rather than guilt), and modern evangelical/Reformed interpreters.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropology, sin (hamartiology), atonement, covenant theology, justification (imputation), and eschatology insofar as death and resurrection play into remedy.
- **Closing line**
 - Hoekema centers the doctrine: **original sin is a corporate fall under a representative head that produces imputed guilt, inherited corruption, and encountered death-an integrated problem solved only in Christ the second Adam.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Balanced tri-partite framing (guilt, pollution, death) gives conceptual clarity and resists reduction to a single element (e.g., only corruption or only guilt).
 - Stresses the juridical reality of guilt alongside ontological corruption-both forensic and existential language are kept.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Counters Pelagian and semi-Pelagian minimizations of inherited guilt and depravity.
 - Differentiates Eastern Orthodox avoidance of imputable guilt by showing the biblical basis for forensic imputation without denying the reality of inherited corruption.
 - Moderates extremes that make original sin purely metaphysical (depravity only) or purely legal (imputation only).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematic juxtaposition of **guilt, pollution, and death** as discrete yet inseparable aspects aids theological pedagogy and debate.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical and Reformed teaching as a clear, concise summary aligning with classical confessions; often cited in introductory texts and pastoral contexts.
 - Functions as a standard evangelical entry on original sin in reference works, shaping classroom and pulpit summaries.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable pedagogical utility: succinct schema for seminars, sermon series, and inter-traditional dialogues on sin and salvation.
 - Helps mediate between polarizing modern proposals by holding juridical and existential dimensions in conversation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin**
 - The state and consequence of Adam's fall as transmitted to all humanity.
- **Guilt (forensic imputation)**
 - Legal culpability counted to Adam's descendants; grounds need for justification.
- **Pollution / Corruption (inherited depravity)**
 - The moral-ontological bent of human nature toward sin; not merely absence of goodness.
- **Death**
 - Both spiritual alienation from God and physical mortality introduced by the fall.
- **Federal headship (representative view)**
 - Adam acts as covenant representative whose act legally affects his posterity.
- **Realism / Seminal headship**
 - Augustinian-type notion of transmission (seed/ontological participation); discussed as complementary/tension with federal view.
- **Pelagianism / Semi-Pelagianism**
 - Views denying original guilt or reducing its effects; Hoekema critiques these as inconsistent with Scripture.
- **Augustinianism**
 - Source of classic formulations emphasizing both transmission and imputation; a primary ancestor of Reformed formulations.
- **Second Adam (Christ)**
 - Christ's representative obedience and atonement reverse Adam's effects-imputation of righteousness and renewal of nature.
- **Total depravity**
 - The extent statement: sin affects every aspect of human nature; derived from inherited corruption.
- **Imputation (double: of sin and of righteousness)**
 - Sin imputed from Adam to humanity; Christ's righteousness imputed to believers.
- **Solidarity / Corporate personality**
 - Biblical anthropology allowing one person's act to stand for many (basis for federal imputation).
- **Prevenient grace (not central but interactant)**
 - Mentioned in contrast to views that insist on antecedent enabling grace for all.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a concise **definition source** for evangelical and Reformed syllabi and handbooks.
 - As a **polemic** against Pelagian tendencies and as a bridge to Eastern critiques by clarifying imputation vs. corruption.
 - As an **exegetical model** orienting readings of Romans 5 and Pauline anthropology for teaching soteriology and covenant theology.
