### TITLE
The Inspiration of Scripture (article, 1902) - Herman Bavinck

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 20th-century Dutch Reformed theology; reaction to 19th-century rationalism and emergent higher-critical scholarship (Wellhausen, Graf, K. H. Graf, historical-critical method).
 - Bavinck writing as a systematic theologian committed to confessional Reformed orthodoxy while engaging contemporary scholarship with scholarly seriousness.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Scripture is the authoritative, divinely inspired Word of God; inspiration is neither mechanical dictation nor purely human product.
 - Bavinck addresses how God can be the author of Scripture without obliterating genuine human authorship and historical contingency, and how Scripture can be trustworthy (inerrant/infallible) in its saving purpose.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of what "inspiration" means historically and theologically: distinction between revelation, inspiration, and illumination.
 - Defense of dual authorship: God as primary author working through real human authors who retain personal style, context, and limitations.
 - Rejection of both extremes:
 - Against mechanical/verbal dictation: denies that inspiration eliminates human individuality and historical particularity.
 - Against purely naturalistic or subjective views (rationalism, romanticism, neo-orthodoxy): upholds objective truth and divine origin.
 - Affirmation of the trustworthiness of Scripture:
 - Inerrancy applied primarily to the autographs and to Scripture's saving and doctrinal witness.
 - Accommodation: God speaks in human forms and language; this does not entail error in what God intends to convey.
 - Engagement with historical criticism: distinguishes legitimate historical inquiry from skepticism that seeks to overturn Scripture's authority.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Reformed tradition: Calvin (accommodation, clarity), Kuyper (common grace, cultural engagement), earlier Reformed confessions.
 - Contemporary critics: representatives of higher criticism (Wellhausen-type skepticism) and rationalist/modernist theologians.
 - Implicit dialogue with emerging 20th-century epistemologies concerning revelation and authority.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, inspiration, inerrancy/infallibility, illumination, canon, authority of Scripture; secondary reference to the work of the Holy Spirit and Christological grounding of the Word.

- **Closing line**
 - Bavinck locates the theological center of gravity in the conviction that Scripture is the living, authoritative Word of God-divinely inspired yet genuinely human in expression-adequate and reliable for faith and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasis on an **organic (dynamic) theory of inspiration**: divine and human authorship are integrally related rather than opposed.
 - Careful balance of **objective authority** and **historical particularity**: Scripture is true in what it intends to teach while written within real historical-cultural frames.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects mechanical dictation models by preserving human authorship and literary variety.
 - Opposes radical higher criticism and rationalist reductions that make Scripture purely human product or mere religious experience.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear operational distinctions among **revelation**, **inspiration**, and **illumination** used to deploy theological responsibilities for origin, composition, and appropriation.
 - Forthright use of **dual authorship** language without collapsing divine action into human causality.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded as a measured, academically respectable defense of confessional Reformed doctrine of Scripture.
 - Influenced subsequent Reformed dogmatics and conservative-critical engagement-model for integrating confessional fidelity with scholarly critique.
 - Valued by those seeking a middle path between fundamentalist literalism and liberal skepticism.

- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary for teaching how to hold together divine authorship and human literary particularity.
 - Useful as a methodological exemplar for pastors and theologians engaging modern critical tools without capitulating to corrosive skepticism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inspiration** - The Spirit-mediated divine influence on human authors such that Scripture is God's Word in human words; not identical with dictation.
- **Dual authorship** - The doctrine that Scripture has both a divine author (God/Spirit) and genuine human authors.
- **Revelation** - The act by which God discloses Himself and redemptive truth; antecedent to inspiration.
- **Illumination** - The Spirit's work enabling understanding and appropriation of Scripture by readers.
- **Organic (dynamic) inspiration** - Bavinck's preferred model emphasizing living interaction between divine will and human faculties.
- **Dictation (mechanical inspiration)** - Rejected model that eradicates human individuality in composition.
- **Accommodation** - God's condescension to human language and categories; permits historicity and figurative expression without implying error in divine intent.
- **Inerrancy / infallibility** - Trustworthiness of Scripture; Bavinck stresses inerrancy particularly for autographs and in matters necessary for salvation and doctrine.
- **Authority (canonical authority)** - Scripture's normative role in faith and life grounded in divine origin.
- **Historical criticism** - Recognized as a tool; Bavinck critiques its hostile presuppositions while sometimes accepting legitimate historical methods.
- **Perspicuity / clarity** - Scripture's sufficient clarity for the gospel and basic doctrine; related to accommodation and the Spirit's work.
- **Testimony of the Spirit** - Internal witness validating Scripture's authority to believers.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **dogmatic definition** source for inspiration and canonical authority in Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic resource** opposing both mechanistic fundamentalism and corrosive historical-critical skepticism.
 - As an **exegetical and methodological model** demonstrating how to employ historical-critical tools responsibly while maintaining confessional commitments.
