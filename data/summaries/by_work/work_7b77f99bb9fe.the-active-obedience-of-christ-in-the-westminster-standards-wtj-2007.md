### TITLE
The Active Obedience of Christ in the Westminster Standards (WTJ 2007) - David VanDrunen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in Westminster Theological Journal (2007) within contemporary Reformed-confessional debates over justification.
 - Situated against late 20th-21st century reassessments of Pauline justification (e.g., New Perspective debates) and intra-Reformed disputes about the imputation of Christ's righteousness.
 - Uses the Westminster Standards (Confession, Larger and Shorter Catechisms) as primary text-objects for confessional exegesis.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Standards intentionally and coherently teach the **imputation of Christ's active obedience** to believers as the ground of their justification, distinct from his passive obedience (suffering and death).
 - The article counters readings that deny or minimize the formal imputation of Christ's positive righteousness and that reduce active obedience to mere example or covenantal faithfulness without forensic transfer.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Textual survey of the Westminster Confession and Catechisms to locate formulations about Christ's obedience and its juridical function.
 - Historical-theological parsing of the Standards' terminology (e.g., "merit," "satisfaction," "obedience") and their relation to Reformed covenantal language.
 - Theological argument for a twofold obedience model:
 - **Passive obedience**: Christ's sufferings and death expiate penalty.
 - **Active obedience**: Christ's perfect life fulfills the law and secures righteousness imputed to believers.
 - Engagement with contemporary critics who reinterpret Westminster language in non-forensic ways; demonstration that such re-readings conflict with the Standards' legal-covenantal framework.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Westminster Confession of Faith, Larger and Shorter Catechisms, Assembly debates and divines implicit in the Standards.
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern evangelical and Reformed scholars challenging traditional imputation (implicitly the New Perspective and related revisionist voices), and other defenders of classical forensic readings.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (twofold obedience), soteriology (justification, imputation, satisfaction), covenant theology (covenant of works/merit, federal headship), forensic doctrine (merit, alien righteousness).

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Westminster Standards, read historically and doctrinally on their own terms, affirm the forensic imputation of Christ's active obedience as integral to the Reformed doctrine of justification.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precise confessional exegesis: reads Westminster as a juridical, covenantal system that presupposes both active and passive obedience as distinct but complementary soteriological contributions.
 - Emphasizes continuity between 17th-century divines' legal vocabulary and contemporary Reformed usage.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects revisionist accounts that reinterpret active obedience as merely exemplary or as non-imputed covenant-faithfulness.
 - Contrasts with approaches that detach the Standards from their legal-forensic and federal language, showing such detachments are anachronistic.

- **Conceptual / terminological contributions**
 - Clarifies use of terms like "merit," "satisfaction," and "righteousness" within Westminster texts to support imputation claims without collapsing into Roman notions of intrinsic infused righteousness.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited within Reformed confessional scholarship as a careful defense of classical imputation in a confessional-historical register.
 - Utilized in seminary instruction and confessional debates to rebut revisionist readings.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model for disciplined confessional exegesis and as a concise resource defending the orthodox Reformed account of Christ's twofold obedience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Active obedience** - Christ's perfect law-keeping life; argued to be imputed to believers as positive righteousness.
- **Passive obedience** - Christ's suffering and death; secures expiation of penalty.
- **Imputation** - Forensic transfer of Christ's righteousness (and/or sinlessness) to believers; central claim of the article.
- **Justification** - Declaration of righteousness based on Christ's obedience (both active and passive), received by faith.
- **Merit / satisfaction** - Westminster usage affirms Christ's merit/satisfaction in a forensic sense, not in meritorious works-for-salvation from believers.
- **Alien righteousness** - The doctrine that believers receive Christ's righteousness as an outside (alien) gift; affirmed as consistent with Westminster language.
- **Covenant of works** - Background legal-covenantal framework informing why Christ's obedience can be the ground of believers' righteousness.
- **Federal headship** - Christ as representative (second Adam) whose obedience is imputed to those he represents.
- **Forensic / legal language** - Emphasized as the Standards' idiom for discussing justification and righteousness.
- **Satisfaction theory** - The idea that Christ's obedience and death satisfy divine justice; used to frame both passive and active obedience.
- **Positive righteousness** - The crediting of Christ's fulfilled obedience, not merely freedom from condemnation.
- **Exemplarism (rejected here)** - The view that Christ's obedience is only an example; VanDrunen argues Westminster rejects this as the whole account.
- **Alien vs. infused** - Distinguishes confessional alien (imputed) righteousness from Roman Catholic infused righteousness.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **confessional-definition source** for those defending classical imputation in Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against revisionist/New Perspective reinterpretations that deny forensic imputation.
 - As an **exegetical-model** demonstrating method: read confessions on their own historical-legal terms to resolve doctrinal disputes.
