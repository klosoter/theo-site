### TITLE
**A Treatise Concerning Religious Affections - Jonathan Edwards**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-18th century New England, amid the First Great Awakening and intense revival activity. Edwards writes from the Reformed Puritan/New England Presbyterian milieu to address the experiential controversies of revivalism, enthusiasm, and hypocrisy.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Genuine religion is primarily a matter of the heart - affections rightly ordered toward God - and true saving affections are caused by the Holy Spirit, discernible by characteristic fruits. The treatise responds to how to distinguish authentic conversion from superficial or false religious feeling.
- **Core argument / structure (major moves):**
 - Define "affections" broadly (love, joy, sorrow, desire, hatred, delight, etc.) and argue their primacy for religion.
 - Distinguish natural affections (arising from created or moral causes) from spiritual affections (produced by divine influence).
 - Establish criteria/marks for true religious affections: their origin (God), moral quality (holy), fruit (obedience, humility, love), constancy, proportion to means of grace.
 - Diagnose false affections: hypocrisy (externals without heart), enthusiasm (irrational, transient fervor), and natural sympathy or self-interest mistaken for piety.
 - Provide pastoral guidance for discerning and cultivating genuine affections.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Draws on Puritan predecessors (e.g., Owen, Boston), classical Reformed theology (Augustine/Calvin), and contemporary revival leaders and critics. Edwards interacts implicitly with enthusiasts (Moravians, some revival excesses) and with skeptics who reduce religion to intellect or ritual.
- **Doctrines treated:** Regeneration/new birth, Holy Spirit activity, sanctification and Christian obedience, evidences of conversion, moral psychology of the soul, and soteriological assumptions (esp. divine causation of saving affections).
- **Site usage note:** 1 reference cited under the topic **Total Depravity And Total Inability** - Edwards grounds his account of affections in the view that fallen humans cannot produce saving affections without divine intervention.
- **Closing line:** Edwards locates the center of genuine Christianity in Spirit-wrought affections that both manifest and produce holiness - a pastoral Reformed account linking inner transformation to observable fruit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes affections (feelings/will orientations) as the primary index of true religion rather than mere intellectual assent or external conformity.
 - Systematic attention to psychological nuance: gradations of feeling, moral quality, permanence, and proportionality to truth.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects cold intellectualism in some revival-skeptical Puritanism by affirming experiential change as central.
 - Rejects both antinomian/enthusiastic claims (emotion divorced from holiness) and mere formalism (outward rites without heart).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - The phrase and analytic category "religious affections" becomes a durable technical term for evaluating conversion and spiritual life.
 - A careful taxonomy of marks of true versus false religious experience.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Hugely influential in American evangelical and Reformed pastoral theology; shaped later revival accounts and experiential apologetics.
 - Used by revivalists as a theological defense of awakenings, and by subsequent theologians as a model for correlating doctrine and experience.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a model for integrating doctrine, pastoral discernment, and psychological observation; indispensable for courses on spiritual formation, conversion, and the theology of experience.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Affections:** Central category - emotions, desires, volitions oriented toward God or creatures; the principal indicators of true religion.
- **Religious affections / true affections:** Affections that are God-originated, holy in object and manner, and produce sanctified living.
- **Natural affections:** Feelings grounded in creaturely causes (sympathy, fear, self-interest) that can mimic religion but lack divine origin.
- **False affections / enthusiasm:** Transient, disproportionate, or irrational fervors not resulting in holiness; often the target of Edwards' critique.
- **Regeneration / new birth:** The Spirit-produced change that creates true religious affections; not producible by human effort (see Total Depravity).
- **Total Depravity / Total Inability:** Edwards assumes fallen human nature cannot produce saving affections; genuine affections therefore testify to divine agency (site usage: 1 reference).
- **Marks of conversion / evidences:** Fruits such as humility, love to God and neighbor, self-denial, obedience, mortification of sin, and constancy under trial.
- **Sanctification / fruit:** Progressive transformation that authenticates initial affections; the treatise ties inward feeling to outward conformity.
- **Discernment / pastoral testing:** Edwards supplies practical criteria for pastors and believers to evaluate spiritual claims.
- **Proportion / stability:** True affections are proportioned to revealed truth and persist, not merely episodic excitement.
- **Humility and self-renunciation:** Recurrent marks: true affections lead away from self-exaltation toward God-centeredness.
- **Love to God and neighbors:** Primordial evidence - affections produce moral love as their outward fruit.
- **Devotional use / catechetical edge:** The treatise functions pastorally to instruct believers in cultivating and recognizing genuine affections.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for what counts as authentic religious experience (affective criteria).
- As a **polemic** against both sentimental enthusiasm and cold formalism - defending revivals while restraining excess.
- As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for discerning conversion and guiding spiritual formation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Reformed doctrines (regeneration, depravity) with experiential theology and pastoral practice.
