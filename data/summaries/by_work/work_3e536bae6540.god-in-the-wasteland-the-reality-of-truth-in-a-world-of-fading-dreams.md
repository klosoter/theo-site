### TITLE
God in the Wasteland: The Reality of Truth in a World of Fading Dreams - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1994 amid late 20th-century evangelical malaise: postmodern turn, commodified religion, and broad secularization of Western culture.
 - Part of Wells's broader critique across evangelicalism of intellectual decline, theological dilution, and pastoral compromise.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary Christianity has become a "wasteland" because it has abandoned truth as objective, doctrinal, and formative; this yields cultural irrelevance, privatized piety, and ecclesial weakness.
 - The corrective is recovery of the **reality of truth**-the church's doctrines and practices must be intellectually and spiritually robust.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnose: charts historical and cultural forces (modernity, therapeutic religion, pragmatism) that erode doctrinal seriousness.
 - Critique: exposes evangelical accommodation to market forces, ephemeral worship styles, and anti-intellectualism.
 - Proposal: call to recover theology as a disciplined intellectual enterprise, revitalized preaching, reclaimed sacraments and prayer, and a church formed by truth.
 - Practical emphasis: clerical formation, renewed seminary training, and ecclesial practices that embody doctrine.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit conversation with liberal Protestant accommodationists, pragmatic popularizers of faith, and segments of evangelicalism privileging experience/relevance over doctrine.
 - Dialogues with confessional and Reformed traditions insofar as Wells appeals to doctrinal integrity and historical rootedness.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (authority and propositional content), doctrine as formative (union of orthodoxy and orthopraxy), ecclesiology (means of grace), preaching, sacraments, and the cognitive content of faith.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: the church's health depends on reasserting truth as objective, doctrinally rich, and integral to worship and life rather than treating Christianity as a privatized, therapeutic, or marketable consumer good.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Frames contemporary decline not merely as cultural pressure but as an internal theological failure: loss of truth-talk and doctrinal courage.
 - Insists on the unity of theology and pastoral practice-doctrine must shape preaching, sacraments, and prayer.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against accommodationist modernizers: rejects the idea that relevance requires doctrinal dilution.
 - Against anti-intellectual pietism: critiques privatized spirituality that severs belief from rigorous doctrine and public witness.
 - Contra therapeutic religion: rejects self-help language as replacing gospel conviction.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Wasteland" as theological-cultural diagnosis: a metaphor that links cultural desolation to doctrinal erosion.
 - "Reality of truth": reclaiming truth as ontological and formative, not merely propositional or subjective preference.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a rallying text for renewed seminary education and confessional recovery.
 - Adopted by pastors and theologians concerned with preaching quality and doctrinal catechesis; critiqued by some for broad brush and occasional cultural determinism.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative corrective that re-centers theology as vocational and public; valuable for seminaries, pastoral audits, and cultural theology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Wasteland**: cultural-theological diagnosis of contemporary Christianity's impoverishment.
- **Reality of truth**: truth as objective, formative, and institutionally embodied in church teaching and practice.
- **Doctrinal seriousness**: insistence that doctrine is essential to faith's vitality and public witness.
- **Accommodation**: the tendency to reshape the gospel to cultural preferences; a principal target of Wells's critique.
- **Pragmatism (religious)**: faith assessed by usefulness and experience rather than truthfulness; criticized as corrosive.
- **Theology as discipline**: theology conceived as rigorous intellectual work integral to ministry formation (links to Theological Method / Principia theology-as-science topic).
 - Emphasizes historical theology, careful doctrinal work, and reasoned engagement with culture.
- **Means of grace**: preaching, sacraments, and prayer are restored as formative practices, not merely symbolic or optional.
 - Preaching: must be doctrinal, discipling, and intellectually substantive.
 - Sacraments: seen as ecclesial anchors against privatized faith.
 - Prayer: communal and doctrinally informed, not merely therapeutic.
- **Confessionalism**: appeal to historic creeds and confessions as safeguards of truth.
- **Ecclesial formation**: process by which doctrine shapes character, worship, and mission.
- **Cultural critique**: analysis of modernity, secularization, and consumer culture as shaping theological decline.
- **Pastoral theology**: Wells links academic theology to pastoral practice-seminary curriculum and ministerial formation are central loci of reform.
- **Public truth vs. private preference**: distinction underscoring truth's communal and propositional dimensions.
- **Truth-recovery strategy**: programmatic call for seminary reform, preaching renewal, and sacramental integrity.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** and programmatic text in ecclesiology and pastoral theology courses to argue against consumerist church models.
 - As a **definition source** for debates on the nature and task of theology (theology's cognitive claims, formation role).
 - As a **practical model** for reorienting seminary curricula and preaching formation toward doctrinal seriousness and recoverable means of grace.
