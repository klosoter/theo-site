### TITLE
**Kenoticism and the Modern Mind** - H. R. Mackintosh (essays and lectures addressing kenosis in early 20th-century theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 20th century British/Scottish theological milieu; response to the intellectual pressures of modernism (historical criticism, scientific naturalism, and ethical religion).
 - Positioned between liberal attempts to adapt doctrine to modern thought and conservative defenses of classical Christology.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - How to understand the New Testament idea of Christ's "self-emptying" (kenosis, Phil 2:5-11) in a way that is intelligible to the modern mind without sacrificing Chalcedonian affirmations of Christ's full divinity and full humanity.
 - Thesis: kenosis signifies a **voluntary, relational self-limitation** of the Son - genuine human self-limitation and obedience, not an ontological loss of deity.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical starting point: close reading of Phil 2 and synoptic/Johannine material on Jesus' consciousness and obedience.
 - Philosophical-theological move: distinguishes between ontological predicates of deity (unchangeable being) and economic, relational attributes (exercise of power, mode of presence).
 - Argues kenosis pertains to the latter: change in mode of activity, not in divine essence.
 - Christological application: shows how genuine human experience (ignorance in certain respects, suffering, obedience) can coherently belong to the Son without implying diminution of deity.
 - Polemic: rejects both (a) radical kenotic theories that posit a relinquishing of divine attributes and (b) rigid classical readings that make the incarnation a mere appearance of human limitation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural exegesis (Paul, Gospels, Johannine theology).
 - Dialogues with contemporary voices: modernists reshaping doctrine for moral religiosity, continental and German kenoticists (e.g., Thomasius and later proponents), and conservative critics.
 - Draws on patristic and Reformation motifs (self-emptying as kenosis in Athanasius/Chalcedon reading and reformational emphases on the work of Christ).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Principal: Christology (incarnation, person of the Son, hypostatic union, kenosis).
 - Related: Trinity (economic vs. immanent relations), attributes of God (immutability, impassibility), revelation and atonement, human nature and freedom.

- **Closing line**
 - Mackintosh centers a **balanced kenotic Christology**: incarnation is real and costly self-limitation by the Son, preserving divine identity while explaining genuine human experience and moral obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Emphasizes the moral and relational character of kenosis: self-emptying is primarily ethical-obediential rather than metaphysical subtraction.
 - Treats divine attributes as exercisable in modes; God can voluntarily restrict the exercise of certain attributes while remaining ontologically intact.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counters radical kenoticism that reduces the divine to a changing substance and thereby risks adoptionism or division in the person of Christ.
 - Corrects rigid immutability-obsessed readings that make the incarnation unintelligible by denying any real human limitation.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Routine use of the phrase **"voluntary self-limitation"** or **"mode-relative kenosis"** to capture the middle path between subtraction and theatrical appearance.
 - Clarifies the distinction: **ontological identity** versus **economic operation** of the Godhead.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Respected within Scottish and Reformed circles as a measured, scholarly engagement with modern concerns; used as a corrective in mid-20th-century Christological debates.
 - Influenced pastoral and academic treatments that seek to make orthodox Christology intelligible in a secular age.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models methodological humility: rigorous exegesis + careful metaphysical distinctions.
 - Valuable for teaching incarnational theology that must speak to modern philosophical sensibilities without capitulating to reductionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kenosis** - "self-emptying" (Phil 2:7); primary phenomenon under study. 
- **Voluntary self-limitation** - Mackintosh's preferred formulation: the Son's deliberate refraining from exercising certain divine prerogatives in the incarnation. 
- **Ontological identity vs. economic operation** - crucial distinction: being (what God is) vs. mode of activity (how God acts in history). 
- **Hypostatic union** - union of divine and human natures in one person; preserved by Mackintosh against both dilution and division. 
- **Immutability** - divine constancy; recast to allow relational/functional change without essential alteration. 
- **Impassibility** - classical claim that God cannot suffer; Mackintosh nuances this to safeguard Christ's true suffering without implying change in divine essence. 
- **Communicatio idiomatum** - communication of properties between natures; used to explain how human experiences belong to the Son while deity remains. 
- **Mode-relative attribute exercise** - idea that attributes (omnipotence, omniscience) can be exercised differently in the incarnation. 
- **Philippians 2 exegesis** - exegetical anchor; Mackintosh leans on its theological grammar to shape doctrine. 
- **Genuine human limitation** - maintains Jesus' real ignorance, development, and obedience as essential to atonement and exemplar ethics. 
- **Radical kenoticism** - term for views Mackintosh opposes that posit actual loss of divine attributes. 
- **Chalcedonian fidelity** - commitment to the Council's formula as the doctrinal boundary condition. 
- **Economic Trinity** - how God acts in history; primary locus where kenosis is located. 
- **Theological method** - blend of scripture-centered exegesis and cautious metaphysical reflection.

How this work is used:
- As a **definition source** for a balanced, orthodox account of kenosis (voluntary self-limitation).
- As a **polemic** against both radical kenotic reductions and frozen immutability defenses.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Phil 2 in doctrinal context and a **conceptual pivot** in modern Christology courses.
