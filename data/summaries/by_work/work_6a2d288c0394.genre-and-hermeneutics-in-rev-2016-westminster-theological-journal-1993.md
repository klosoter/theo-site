### TITLE
"Genre and Hermeneutics in Rev 20:1-6" - Vern Poythress, Westminster Theological Journal (1993)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 1990s Reformed scholarship engaging a resurgent premillennial/futurist literature; conversation located at the intersection of evangelical hermeneutics and scholarship on apocalyptic literature.
 - Poythress writes as a Reformed exegete and systematician concerned to align literary-grammatical reading with confessional theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The interpretive decision for Rev 20:1-6 turns on **genre recognition**: Revelation uses symbolic, prophetic-apocalyptic modes that constrain literalist, chronologically sequential readings of the "thousand years."
 - A correct hermeneutic yields a non-literal (symbolic/representative) reading that coheres with Reformed eschatology (broadly amillennial or non-dispensational).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define the genre features of Revelation: symbolic imagery, OT prophetic intertextuality, and rhetorical-visionary aims rather than straightforward historical reportage.
 - Establish hermeneutical principles: authorial intent, literary context, intertextual signals, and the inappropriateness of importing modern literalist assumptions.
 - Apply principles to Rev 20: analyze the language of "binding," "thousand years," "first resurrection," and "reign" in their immediate and OT-apocalyptic contexts to show symbolic rather than strictly chronological meanings.
 - Conclude that the passage depicts Christ's present, decisive victory and the vindication of martyrs in a theological-visionary idiom rather than charting a future terrestrial millennium.

- **Figures / sources engaged**
 - Dialogues broadly with:
 - Premillennial/futurist interpreters (critique of literal chronological readings).
 - Scholarship on apocalyptic genre and Jewish apocalyptic backgrounds.
 - Reformed hermeneutical traditions advocating historical-grammatical principles adapted to genre.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Eschatology** (millennial interpretations, resurrection, reign of Christ).
 - **Hermeneutics** (genre-sensitive method, intertextuality).
 - Secondary implications for **Christology** (victory and kingship) and **revelation** (prophetic/apocalyptic communication).

- **Closing line**
 - Poythress locates the theological center of gravity in the claim that **genre-sensitive hermeneutics require symbolic readings of Rev 20:1-6, aligning Revelation's vision with realized and inaugurated aspects of Christ's reign rather than a literal earthly thousand-year reign.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong stress on genre as a controlling hermeneutical category - not merely a descriptive label but a normative constraint on literalism.
 - Integrates systematic concerns (how the passage fits broader covenantal and Christological doctrine) with close literary analysis.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Targets premillennial/dispensational exegesis that reads Rev 20 as chronological, contiguous history.
 - Contrasts with naive literalism by showing how apocalyptic conventions make a literal-chronological reading methodologically inappropriate.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Emphasizes the notion of "visionary-theological time" (non-linear, theologically shaped chronology) and "representative numbers" (e.g., 1,000 as symbolic).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Useful and cited within Reformed circles as a clear exemplar of genre-aware exegesis applied to Revelation; taken up by those advocating amillennial/responsive readings.
 - Serves as a counterpoint in evangelical debates on millennium interpretation; influential for pastors and students needing a concise hermeneutical corrective.

- **Enduring value**
 - Compact model showing how literary genre and theological concerns must interact; durable pedagogical value for teaching exegetical method in eschatology courses.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Genre**
 - Revelation as prophetic-apocalyptic rather than straightforward historiography; genre constraints meaning.
- **Apocalyptic**
 - Characterized by symbolism, visions, angelic mediation, and symbolic chronology.
- **Prophetic**
 - Continuity with OT prophetic idiom (topical, symbolic, and oracular speech).
- **Symbolic language**
 - Imagery and numbers function representatively, not necessarily literally.
- **Chronology / Non-linear time**
 - Visions employ theological sequencing, not strict sequential history.
- **"Thousand years" / 1,000**
 - Treated as symbolic of completeness/perfection or representative period, not necessarily a literal millennium.
- **"First resurrection"**
 - Interpreted in light of martyrs and vindication; distinction between spiritual/resurrectional motifs and bodily-chronological resurrection.
- **Binding of Satan**
 - A theological motif meaning Christ's restraining victory, not an exclusively future political imprisonment.
- **Reign with Christ**
 - Sense of present participatory reign for martyrs/saints; inaugurated eschatology emphasis.
- **Intertextuality / OT allusions**
 - Use of Isaiah, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Jewish apocalyptic imagery to locate referents.
- **Hermeneutical rules**
 - Authorial intent, literary context, and genre-formal cues govern interpretation.
- **Representative numbers**
 - Numerical symbolism common in apocalyptic literature.
- **Visionary-theological time**
 - Temporal idioms shaped by theological message rather than clock-time.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for genre-sensitive hermeneutics of Revelation.
- As a **polemic** against literalist premillennial/dispensational exegesis.
- As an **exegetical model** demonstrating application of literary and intertextual principles to problematic eschatological texts.
