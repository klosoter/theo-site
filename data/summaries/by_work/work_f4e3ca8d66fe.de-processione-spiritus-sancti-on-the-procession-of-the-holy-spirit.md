### TITLE
**De Processione Spiritus Sancti** - Anselm of Canterbury (11th-12th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 11th / early 12th century Western Latin theology; Anselm writing as Archbishop of Canterbury in the immediate post-1054 milieu when Latin-Greek tensions over the Creed and the Filioque were prominent. Works from the same period show Anselm's fusion of patristic exegesis and emerging Scholastic method.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defend the formulation that the Holy Spirit proceeds *from the Father and the Son* (Filioque) without compromising the Father's monarchy as the sole origin (principium) of the Trinity.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Establishes semantic and metaphysical distinctions: procession as relational origin (processio/spiratio) vs. personal subsistence (hypostasis); distinguishes cause, origin, and order.
 - Appeals to Scripture and chiefly to Augustine to show that the Spirit's procession can intelligibly be said to involve both Father and Son without creating two origins.
 - Argues that the Son shares in the Father's generative role logically or formally (as cause) without supplanting the Father as the unique source; thus "from the Father and the Son" preserves monarchical principle while accounting for the Spirit's relation to the Son.
 - Defines how to speak of persons and relations so that consubstantiality (same divine substance) remains intact.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Augustine (primary patristic authority), Latin exegetical tradition; implicitly addressing Greek objections (e.g., principles later associated with Photius and the Eastern theological response) and the ecclesial dispute over Creedal phrasing.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (relations of origin), procession (processio/spiratio), persons (hypostases), creed and confessional language, Scripture as theological criterion.
- **Closing line:** A compact, argumentative defence that the Filioque is both scripturally defensible and theologically coherent provided one keeps clear distinctions between origin, causality, and personal subsistence.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Rigorous use of philosophical precision (causa, principium, relation) applied to Trinitarian language; clarity about different senses of "proceeds."
 - Strong reliance on Augustine as normative interpreter for Trinitarian procession.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters Eastern objections by insisting that saying the Spirit proceeds from Father and Son does not mean two separate sources; it affirms an ordered unity.
 - Offers a corrective to simplistic readings that pit Filioque against the monarchy of the Father.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Explicit distinction between ontological origin (principium) and relational expression; precursor to later Scholastic refinements (e.g., the causality language of later medieval theologians).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential within the Latin West as an articulate defense of the Filioque; cited by later scholastics and polemicists.
 - Rejected by the Eastern Orthodox tradition, which continued to press concerns about monarchy and the danger of confusing origins.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a clear exemplar of medieval theological method: precise conceptual distinctions, patristic appeal, and brief polemical form. Useful in teaching Trinitarian exegesis and the history of the Filioque controversy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Filioque:** Latin phrase "and the Son"; central claim that the Spirit proceeds from the Father *and the Son*.
- **Processio (procession):** The relational coming forth of the Spirit; analyzed into senses to avoid equivocation.
- **Spiratio:** Often used interchangeably with processio in Latin; Anselm treats the act of "breathing forth" metaphorically and theologically.
- **Principium:** The principle or origin; Anselm insists on a single principium (the Father) while allowing the Son a participatory causal role.
 - Contrast: principium (origin) vs. participatory causality (the Son's role).
- **Hypostasis / Persona:** Individual subsistence of Father, Son, Spirit; used to prevent collapse into modalism.
- **Relatio:** The relations that distinguish the persons; central to Anselm's account of procession without dividing substance.
- **Consubstantialitas (consubstantiality):** Shared divine essence/ousia; preserved in Anselm's account.
- **Causa (causality):** Differentiation of causal language to explain the Son's involvement without making two independent sources.
- **Scriptural proofs:** John 15:26; John 16; Romans 8 cited for Spirit's procession and mission.
- **Creedal language (Symbolum):** Debate over legitimately extending the Creed's formulation; Anselm defends Western elaboration as theologically warranted.
- **Augustinian authority:** Augustine as exegetical-theological basis for the Filioque defense.
- **Monarchy of the Father:** Doctrinal commitment to Father as the unique origin; maintained by careful terminological distinctions.
- **Procession vs. mission:** Distinguishes eternal relation (procession) from temporal sending (mission).
- **Terminological precision:** Anselm models how to use philosophical terms to safeguard dogma.

- **Uses across loci:**
 - **Definition source:** Cited in Western theology as a concise definition and defense of Filioque formulations.
 - **Polemic resource:** Employed in medieval and later polemics against Eastern objections to show coherence of the Filioque.
 - **Exegetical model:** Example of harmonizing Scripture and Augustine with philosophical clarity in Trinitarian theology.
