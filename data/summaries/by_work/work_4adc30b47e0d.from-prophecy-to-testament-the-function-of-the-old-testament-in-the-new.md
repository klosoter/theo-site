### TITLE
From Prophecy to Testament: The Function of the Old Testament in the New - Craig A. Evans

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th / early 21st-century New Testament scholarship with rising interest in intertextuality, canonical approaches, and Second Temple Jewish hermeneutics. Written by Craig A. Evans, a prominent NT historian focused on Gospel studies, the Septuagint, and Jewish contexts of early Christianity.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The New Testament does not simply borrow the Old Testament as source material; it *functions* as authoritative testimony whose texts are reinterpreted, reapplied, and read typologically and prophetically to articulate Christology, covenant continuity, and ecclesial identity.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Catalogues and analyzes modes of OT use in the NT (quotation, echo/allusion, typology, midrashic recasting, fulfillment formulae).
 - Emphasizes the *function* of OT citations-what the OT does for NT authors rhetorically and theologically-over narrow source-critical origin questions.
 - Situates NT practices within Jewish exegetical norms (Septuagint usage, rabbinic parallels, Qumran evidence) to show continuity and innovation.
 - Argues for a theology of Scripture in the NT that treats the OT as covenantal testimony pointing to Christ and the church.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:**
 - Primary texts: Septuagint (LXX), Gospels, Paul, Hebrews, Revelation, and early Christian literature.
 - Comparanda: Qumran texts, rabbinic patterns, Jewish interpretive methods.
 - Scholarly interlocutors: proponents of canonical theology and intertextuality (e.g., Richard Hays, Brevard Childs), critics of naive proof-texting, and historians of Second Temple Judaism.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation and the authority of Scripture, Christology (fulfillment and typology), covenant and promise, ecclesiology (identity formation), hermeneutics of prophecy.
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** The NT reads the OT as living testimony whose prophetic and narrative patterns are fulfilled and reconfigured in Christ, thereby grounding Christian identity and doctrine in a reinterpreted continuity with Israel.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases:**
 - Moves from asking "Where did they get it?" to "What does the OT do in NT discourse?" - shifting focus from provenance to function.
 - Strong attention to how the Septuagint mediates OT meaning for NT authors.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Pushes back against simplistic proof-texting that treats OT quotation as mere factual evidence for Jesus.
 - Aligns but also distinguishes from canonical theologians by insisting on socioreligious and rhetorical contexts (Second Temple practices) rather than exclusively canonical final-form arguments.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic taxonomy of OT functions in the NT (e.g., prophetic-fulfillment, typological recapitulation, midrashic reapplication, narrative echo) presented as methodological categories for exegesis.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical and broader academic settings as a concise introduction to NT use of OT; cited in works on Christology, homiletics, and canonical interpretation.
 - Stimulated further work that integrates LXX studies and Jewish hermeneutics into NT exegesis.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clear, usable typology of OT use; practical for preaching and classroom exegesis; bridges text-critical, historical, and theological concerns.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Fulfillment (pleroo):** NT claim that OT promises and prophecies reach their telos in Christ; analyzed as a rhetorical-theological move, not only predictive verification.
- **Typology:** Patterns or persons in the OT (e.g., Moses, David, Exodus) reread as prefigurations whose significance is reinterpreted in light of Christ.
- **Midrashic reapplication:** NT technique of reworking OT narrative or law to yield new theological points, often parallel to Jewish exegetical practice.
- **Quotation vs. Allusion vs. Echo:** Distinctions Evans uses to classify direct citation, recognizable verbal reference, and subtler thematic resonance.
- **Septuagint (LXX):** The Greek OT text as the primary textual medium through which many NT authors read and quoted Scripture.
- **Testimony/Testament:** The OT as witness-legal and covenantal testimony-used by NT writers to establish continuity and authority.
- **Intertextuality:** The network of textual references and receptions; Evans privileges functional outcomes of intertextual links.
- **Proof-texting:** The practice Evans critiques when it reduces OT use to mere evidentiary snatches detached from rhetorical function.
- **Recapitulation/Patterning:** The method by which NT authors collapse patterns of OT history into Christ-event interpretation.
- **Hermeneutical continuity:** The theological claim that NT reinterpretations remain in continuity with Israelite Scripture while effecting transformation.
- **Second Temple Jewish hermeneutics:** Shows NT readings as embedded in contemporary Jewish interpretive norms rather than uniquely Christian inventions.
- **Covenant promise-fulfillment motif:** Core framework for understanding how the OT is employed to locate Jesus within divine promises.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition source** for categories of OT use in NT studies (quotation, allusion, typology).
- As a **polemic** against naive proof-texting and against models that divorce NT use from Jewish hermeneutical contexts.
- As an **exegetical model** in preaching and classroom work, supplying concrete examples and functional analysis for interpreting NT citation of OT.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates on covenant continuity, canonical reading, and the authority of Scripture in Christological interpretation.
