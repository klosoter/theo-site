### TITLE
**"Christology" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, New Dictionary of Theology (ed. S. B. Ferguson & D. F. Wright)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century Reformed-evangelical milieu; concise encyclopedic entry in a broadly Reformed dictionary intended for ministers, students, and pastors seeking orthodox, historically grounded summaries.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Presents a biblically rooted, historically orthodox account of the person and work of Christ that integrates classical Chalcedonian formulations with Reformed emphases (union with Christ, substitutionary atonement, covenant headship) to answer contemporary distortions of Jesus' identity and work.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Definition and scope of Christology: person (who Christ is) and work (what Christ does).
 - Biblical foundation: OT promises and NT fulfillment (incarnation, life, death, resurrection, ascension).
 - Historical formulation: affirmation of Chalcedonian hypostatic union (two natures, one person).
 - Christ's offices (Munus Triplex): prophet, priest, king - functional ordering of his work in salvation.
 - Soteriological focus: penal substitution/satisfaction, reconciliation, union with Christ as the means of appropriation.
 - Practical/pastoral consequences: assurance, sanctification, church life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture as primary; patristic and Chalcedonian consensus as authoritative; heavy debt to Reformers (especially Calvin) in doctrine of union and atonement; engages modern critics implicitly (liberal, existential, and some Continental revisionist Christologies).
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (as framework), incarnation, hypostatic union, two natures, atonement (substitution/satisfaction/expiation), resurrection and exaltation, munus triplex (prophet-priest-king), union with Christ, soteriology, ecclesiology insofar as union affects the church.
- **Closing line:** Christology is presented as the doctrinal hinge of Scripture and salvation: the one true God incarnate accomplishing redemption objectively and applying it through covenantal union, shaped by classical definitions and Reformed pastoral concerns.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong pastoral orientation: doctrinal truth is linked directly to assurance, prayer, and sanctification.
 - Integration of classical Chalcedonian doctrine with Reformed covenantal theology and the priority of union with Christ.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects liberal demythologizing and reductionist "ethical teacher" portraits by recovering full deity and saving efficacy of Christ.
 - Distinguishes from some Barthian or existential renderings by retaining forensic language (satisfaction/penal substitution) while avoiding mechanical abstractions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Not primarily innovative; valued for crisp articulation and balanced terminology that keeps **munus triplex** and **union with Christ** central rather than peripheral.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used as a reliable, compact reference in Reformed and evangelical seminaries and churches; shaped preaching and teaching by offering a clear, orthodox summary accessible to ministers.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a dependable précis that links biblical exegesis, historical theology, and pastoral application; valuable as a starting point for deeper systematic or historical study.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** The uniting of two natures (divine and human) in the one person (hypostasis) of Christ - affirmed as the necessary framework for atonement.
- **Two Natures:** Full deity and full humanity coexisting without confusion, change, division or separation (Chalcedonian formula relied upon).
- **Incarnation:** God the Son assuming a true human nature; the ground of Christ's mediatorial work.
- **Munus Triplex (Prophet, Priest, King):**
 - **Prophet:** Revelation and teaching; fulfillment of God's Word.
 - **Priest:** Mediatory, atoning work - sacrifice and intercession.
 - **King:** Lordship and kingdom rule - sovereign application and consummation.
- **Substitutionary Atonement / Penal Substitution:** Christ bears the penalty due sinners; central to the entry's soteriology.
- **Satisfaction / Expiation / Reconciliation:** Legal and relational dimensions of atonement treated as complementary - satisfaction addresses divine justice; reconciliation addresses alienation.
- **Union with Christ:** The union as the vital means by which believers share in Christ's life, death, resurrection; pivotal for application and assurance.
- **Exaltation / Resurrection / Ascension:** Vindication of Christ's work, present session at God's right hand, and the basis for intercession and eschatological hope.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** Historical standard invoked to safeguard orthodox boundaries for the person of Christ.
- **Covenant Headship / Federal Representation:** Christ as federal head whose obedience and suffering are imputed to his people.
- **Kenosis (limited discussion):** Treated cautiously; incarnation understood without implying ontological diminution of the Son.
- **Biblical-theological method:** Use of redemptive-historical narrative to unify person and work.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a concise **definition source** for classroom and sermon preparation on Christological loci.
 - As a **polemic** against reductionist or liberal Christologies, offering orthodox alternatives.
 - As an **exegetical-model pivot** connecting biblical texts to Chalcedonian and Reformed doctrinal formulations.
