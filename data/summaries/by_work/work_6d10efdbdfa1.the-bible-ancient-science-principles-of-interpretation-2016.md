### TITLE
The Bible & Ancient Science: Principles of Interpretation (2016) - Denis O. Lamoureux

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2016 within contemporary evangelical debates over origins. Situated amid theistic-evolution/creation debates and resurgence of Young Earth Creationism (YEC). Lamoureux writes as an evangelical scientist-theologian advocating evolutionary creation (EC).
 - The book responds to modern concordist and literalist readings of Genesis 1-11 by offering principled hermeneutics attentive to the Bible's Ancient Near Eastern (ANE) context and pre-scientific worldview.

- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical authors wrote within an "ancient science" framework; Scripture communicates theological truth rather than modern scientific description. Interpreters must distinguish the Bible's **theological core** from incidental ancient scientific presuppositions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Demonstrates that Genesis (esp. 1-11) embeds ANE cosmology and observational/phenomenological language.
 - Proposes practical interpretive principles for identifying when biblical text expresses theology versus incidental ancient scientific ideas.
 - Emphasizes accommodation: God condescended to human cultural-scientific language to communicate salvific truth.
 - Recommends reading Genesis as theological discourse (purpose, function, covenant significance), not as a scientific account of material origins.
 - Applies principles to key loci: creation, Fall, Flood, genealogies, and early Genesis narratives - arguing these are compatible with modern science when read by these rules.
 - Argues against concordism (forcing modern science into the biblical text) and strict literalism that treats incidental cosmological descriptions as doctrine.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages classical and modern voices: Augustine (exemplary for non-literal Genesis reading), Reformation thinkers on accommodation, contemporary scientists-theologians (pro-EC voices), and critics in YEC/OEC camps (e.g., Answers in Genesis perspectives).
 - Dialogues with ANE scholarship on cosmology and with philosophical discussions on the relationship between Scripture and nature.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inspiration (how divine truth is communicated through culturally conditioned human language).
 - Inerrancy (reinterpreted to allow incidental ancient scientific statements without doctrinal error).
 - Creation and providence (God as Creator sustaining natural processes, including evolution).
 - Hermeneutics (principles for reading Scripture across cultural-scientific divides).

- **Closing line**
 - The book centers on a theologically conservative but hermeneutically generous claim: Scripture reliably teaches God-centered theological truths while using the language of ancient science, and sound interpretation preserves both biblical authority and scientific integrity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic articulation of "ancient science" as a category within hermeneutics: distinguishes descriptive cultural-scientific elements from theological propositional content.
 - Practical interpretive rules aimed at pastors, teachers, and scientists seeking faithful evangelical readings in light of modern science.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to concordism: pushes back on attempts to make Genesis a sourcebook of modern scientific cosmology or chronology.
 - Contrasts with YEC by maintaining biblical authority while accepting mainstream scientific accounts (e.g., common descent, old earth).

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Operationalizes theological **accommodation** as the bridge that preserves inerrancy yet permits pre-scientific formulations in Scripture.
 - Frames the "two-books" motif (Scripture and nature) such that both are revelatory but operate with different rhetorical and epistemic aims.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited among evangelical proponents of evolutionary creation as a clear, pastorally-minded hermeneutic.
 - Criticized by YEC proponents for perceived compromise on literal readings of Genesis; welcomed by many scholars for clarifying hermeneutical stakes.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves both as pedagogical primer and as a working exegetical model for seminars on science-and-scripture, particularly Genesis 1-11.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ancient science**
 - Cultural-scientific assumptions descriptive of the natural world held by ANE authors that appear in biblical texts.
- **Accommodation**
 - God's condescending mode of communication using human cultural language and concepts to convey theological truth.
- **Concordism**
 - The interpretive strategy of forcing biblical text to match modern scientific accounts (rejected by Lamoureux).
- **Literalism (strict)**
 - Readings that treat incidental cosmological descriptions as doctrinally binding scientific claims (critiqued).
- **Phenomenological / appearance language**
 - Textual language that describes events as they appear to observers (e.g., "sun rising")-not scientific description.
- **Evolutionary creation (EC)**
 - Lamoureux's endorsed framework: God creates through evolutionary processes; affirmed alongside orthodox doctrines.
- **Inerrancy (reframed)**
 - Maintained for theological claims while allowing for non-doctrinal, culturally conditioned scientific language.
- **Two-books model**
 - Scripture and nature both reveal God; each must be read according to its genre, purpose, and epistemic limits.
- **Hermeneutical principles**
 - Practical guidelines to separate theological message from incidental ancient science in Genesis 1-11.
- **Genesis 1-11 (use)**
 - Treated as theological and covenantal narrative shaped by ANE cosmology rather than a modern scientific primer.
- **Functional ontology (relation)**
 - Recognizes parallels with approaches that read Genesis 1 as functional description (affinity with John Walton-style insights, though Lamoureux emphasizes broader principles).
- **Phenomenal vs. scientific description**
 - Distinction used to justify non-literal readings of cosmological and observational language.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for the term "ancient science" and the accommodation hermeneutic.
 - As a **polemic** against concordist and YEC readings, deployed in debates and classroom settings.
 - As an **exegetical model** for teaching Genesis 1-11 that preserves doctrinal fidelity while accepting mainstream science.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in evangelical theology of revelation, enabling integration of orthodox doctrine with contemporary science.
