### TITLE
The Mortification of Sin in Believers - John Owen

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English Puritanism (first published 1656); Owen writing in the Reformed orthodox milieu during the Interregnum.
 - Reaction to antinomian laxity and to moralistic, self-reliant piety; pastoral-theological manual for sanctification in a confessional Protestant church.
- **Central thesis**
 - True Christianity requires the deliberate, Spirit-enabled mortification of indwelling sin; believers are duty-bound to put sin to death by the use of appointed means because union with Christ and the Spirit both enable and demand progressive holiness.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: sin remains active in believers (indwelling sin) and wars against the new nature.
 - Theological basis: union with Christ, his death and the Spirit's work make mortification possible and necessary.
 - Practical method: watchfulness, Scripture, prayer, the use of means (means of mortification), and active exercise of faith and repentance.
 - Evidential and pastoral aim: mortification is both duty and evidence of genuine grace; it fosters assurance and perseverance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine and Calvin; engages contemporary Puritan practice and polemics against antinomians, libertines, and moralists.
 - Uses Scripture extensively (esp. Pauline soteriology and pastoral epistles) as normative warrant.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Sanctification, union with Christ, indwelling sin vs. indwelling Spirit, repentance and faith, assurance and perseverance, total depravity/total inability, regeneration.
- **Closing line**
 - Mortification is the indispensable, Spirit-wrought labor of the believer: an ordained duty grounded in union with Christ that both combats the reality of indwelling sin and secures assurance and perseverance.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Systematic coupling of ontology and practice: Owen treats mortification as both covenantal duty and ontological consequence of union with Christ.
 - Intense psychological and pastoral detail about the "inward man" and the operations of lusts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against antinomianism: sanctification is necessary and not optional evidence of grace.
 - Against legalistic moralism: mortification is not meritorious but dependent on Christ's death and the Spirit's enabling (addresses Total Inability).
- **Conceptual/terminological contributions**
 - Clarified and popularized the technical vocabulary of "mortification," "indwelling sin," and "means of mortification" within Reformed praxis.
 - Refines relation between regeneration (a new principle) and the continuing power of sin-preserving both realism about depravity and confidence in grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Canonical Puritan text: deeply influential for later Reformed and evangelical pastoral theology (Jonathan Edwards, 18th-19th century Reformed revival literature).
 - Continues to be cited in Reformed sanctification debates, pastoral counseling, and spiritual formation curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - A model for integrating rigorous theological theology (soteriology, pneumatology) with practical pastoral strategy; rich for preaching, discipleship, and theological formation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Mortification** - the deliberate putting to death of sin in the believer; both duty and grace-enabled work.
- **Indwelling sin** - an active, remaining principle of sin in Christians that must be fought (contrasts with the new indwelling Spirit).
- **Lusts** - pluralized, concrete appetites and inclinations constituting the practical forms of indwelling sin.
- **Means of mortification** - watchfulness, Scripture, prayer, sacraments, and the use of providence and sensible restraints.
- **Union with Christ** - the foundational warrant: Christ's death and resurrection make mortification possible and necessary.
- **Regeneration and indwelling (Regeneration And Indwelling)** - regeneration implants a new nature while sin remains; mortification is the Spirit's work acting through the regenerate.
- **Total depravity / total inability** - Owen affirms human inability to mortify sin unaided; mortification depends on sovereign grace and Spirit-power (Total Depravity And Total Inability).
- **Faith and repentance** - active, ongoing exercises that both evidence and promote mortification; repentance is inseparable from mortifying practice (Faith And Repentance).
- **Sanctification / Spiritual Gifts And Sanctification** - sanctification is broader than giftedness; spiritual gifts are ordered to holiness and must be accompanied by mortification.
- **Assurance and perseverance** - progressive mortification functions as practical evidence of genuine faith and grounds pastoral assurance (Assurance And Perseverance).
- **Spirit (sanctifying)** - the efficient agent; mortification is the Spirit's work wrought through means.
- **Heart / inward man** - focal locus of struggles; Owen's pastoral psychology maps affect, will, and understanding in mortifying work.
- **Watchfulness** - distinctively emphasized as continual vigilance against temptation and the rise of sin.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - Definition source for sanctification and mortification in systematic theology.
 - Polemic and pastoral manual against antinomianism and moralistic self-reliance.
 - Exegetical model for Pauline soteriology (union with Christ and Spirit-work).
 - Conceptual pivot linking doctrines of regeneration, total depravity, assurance, and persevering faith.
