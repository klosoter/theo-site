### TITLE
Perspectives on the Atonement: Three Views (contributor, 2015) - John M. Frame

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑2010s evangelical conversation about atonement models; resurgence of historical and ecumenical reassessment of penal substitution, Christus Victor, and moral‑influence readings.
 - Framed for an audience of advanced students and pastors within broadly Reformed/Evangelical milieus that are reengaging classical atonement debates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The atonement must be understood as a substitutionary, satisfactionary act grounded in divine justice and covenantal faithfulness; competing models (purely moral influence or exclusively Christus Victor formulations) are inadequate without a penal/expiatory core.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical foundation: Scriptures (esp. Pauline and Johannine texts) require language of penalty, propitiation, and representation to account for sin and reconciliation.
 - Theological synthesis: integrates classical Reformed categories - imputation, active/passive obedience, covenant of redemption - to show how Christ's sacrificial work secures justification and redemption.
 - Polemic move: critiques other major models (moral influence, non‑penal Christus Victor, purely governmental theories) as partial or insufficient; argues for a multi‑faceted but centrally substitutionary atonement.
 - Methodological note: applies a triperspectival (normative, situational, existential) reading to the atonement to preserve doctrinal balance and pastoral application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical: Anselm (satisfaction), Calvin and Reformed scholastics (penal substitution/particular redemption).
 - Modern: Gustaf Aulén (Christus Victor), Abelard (moral influence trajectory), and contemporary critics of penal substitution (broadly represented).
 - Uses biblical exegesis, historical theology, and doctrinal theology in conversation.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (atonement necessity, extent), Christology (active/passive obedience, mediatorial office), Trinity (covenant of redemption), imputation and justification, covenant theology, divine justice and wrath.
- **Closing line**
 - A theologically conservative, Reformed defense of substitutionary satisfaction that seeks to retain biblical breadth while insisting that penal/expiatory realities lie at the heart of the atonement.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stress on the coherence of substitution and imputation within a covenantal matrix; the atonement secures both reconciliation and forensic justification.
 - Use of triperspectival method to show how different aspects of atonement (Christus Victor, moral transformation, penal satisfaction) are complementary without erasing the centrality of penal substitution.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushback against readings that reduce the atonement to moral persuasion (Abelardian legacy) or that treat Christus Victor as exhaustive (Aulén's heirs).
 - Clarifies misunderstandings around "penal substitution" by tying it to covenant representation rather than mechanical legalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Explicit integration of triperspectival categories into atonement theology to avoid reductionism; careful terminological distinctions between expiation, propitiation, satisfaction, and substitution.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Favorably received in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a concise contemporary defense of substitutionary doctrines.
 - Used as a corrective in seminaries and in debates where penal substitution is questioned on ethical or exegetical grounds.
- **Enduring value**
 - Valuable for teaching: clear mapping of options, robust biblical‑theological defense of substitution, and a methodological template for integrating multiple atonement motifs.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Penal substitution** - Christ bears the penalty due to sinners; central explanatory category for forgiveness and justification.
- **Satisfaction** - Christ renders what is due to divine justice; tied to both honor and law‑keeping themes.
- **Imputation** - Righteousness of Christ counted to believers; sin of believers imputed to Christ in his substitutionary work.
- **Active and passive obedience** - Christ's life of perfect law‑keeping (active) and his death bearing penalty (passive) together secure redemption.
- **Particular / definite atonement (limited atonement)** - Atonement is efficacious for the elect; defended on covenantal and soteriological grounds.
- **Christus Victor** - Liberation from powers; acknowledged as a legitimate motif but insufficient alone without penal/expiatory content.
- **Moral influence theory** - Viewed as partial and pastorally weak if divorced from forensic realities.
- **Propitiation / expiation** - Propitiation as turning away divine wrath; expiation as removal of guilt - both necessary to Frame's account.
- **Covenant of redemption** - Intra‑Trinitarian plan binding Father, Son, and Spirit to the salvific work; grounds substitutionary engagement.
- **Triperspectivalism** - Frame's methodological lens (normative, situational, existential) used to balance doctrinal, historical, and pastoral elements.
- **Forensic justification** - Legal declaration grounded in Christ's satisfying work and imputed righteousness.
- **Divine justice / wrath** - Not merely punitive abstraction but relational holiness that demands remedy; atonement satisfies both honor and relational breach.
- **Representation** - Christ as covenant head acting on behalf of the elect; crucial for understanding extent and application.
- **Reconciliation** - Restored relationship as result of penal‑satisfaction plus instrumental union with Christ.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for contemporary Reformed articulations of penal substitution and limited atonement.
- As a **polemic resource** against exclusively moral‑influence or solely Christus Victor readings.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Pauline and sacrificial imagery together.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in seminary courses that seek to integrate historical atonement motifs with a robust forensic soteriology.
