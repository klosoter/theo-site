### TITLE
Romans (commentary, 1934) - Rudolf Bultmann

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published in German 1933/34 amid interwar German scholarship; author prominent in form-criticism and early 20th-century liberal/neo-orthodox debates.
 - Bultmann writes as part of a program to reassess NT texts for their existential significance against mythic presuppositions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The letter to the Romans must be read as proclamation (kerygma) about the Christ-event and God's eschatological breaking-in; doctrinal categories (election, Israel, law, justification) are meaningful only insofar as they function within that kerygmatic horizon.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological preface: historical-critical/form-critical attention to Sitz im Leben of Pauline traditions; insistence on distinguishing mythic language from existential proclamation.
 - Exegetical core: chapters-by-chapter reading that:
 - interprets justification by faith as existential encounter with Christ's death and resurrection (not primarily a forensic system of merits);
 - treats the law as the existential horizon exposing human sinfulness leading to the necessity of grace;
 - reads Romans 9-11 (including ch. 11 on Israel) as Paul's attempt to reconcile God's election with Gentile ingrafting, emphasing continuity only in the eschatological horizon.
 - Application: theological implications for ecclesiology and ethics follow from kerygma rather than from national, legal, or mythic presuppositions.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary interlocutor: Paul (text of Romans).
 - Scholarly interlocutors: form-critical tradition, contemporary liberal and neo-orthodox interpreters; implicit counters include literalist and nationalistic readings of Israel.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology, election, covenantal language (Israel), justification, sin and law, Christology (Christ-event), and hermeneutics (demythologizing/existential interpretation).
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Bultmann reads Romans as proclamation of the eschatological Christ-event: election and Israel's future are to be understood not as assurances of ethnic or national continuity but as existential summons to faith within God's decisive act.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong methodological insistence on kerygma over metaphysical or national readings; theology should arise from proclamation, not from metaphysical systems or mythic literalism.
 - Demythologization: mythic-apocalyptic language in Paul must be translated into existential categories that disclose the human situation before God.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects dispensational and nationalistic readings that assign Israel a guaranteed ethnic future independent of the Christ-event.
 - Contrasts with confessional exegesis that treats election as a timeless forensic decree; Bultmann locates election within the eschatological call.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Reapplication of the term **kerygma** as primary theological locus; framing Pauline theology as an existential hermeneutic rather than a propositional system.
 - Use of demythologizing as a standard interpretive program for Pauline apocalyptic language.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in mid-20th-century theological and exegetical circles; major catalyst for existential and form-critical approaches to Paul.
 - Provoked strong critique from conservative and some neo-orthodox theologians who argued Bultmann relativized historical truth and undermined covenantal promises to Israel.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a paradigmatic exegetical model for reading Pauline texts as proclamation; sharpens questions about how to handle apocalyptic language and the relation of Israel's election to the church.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Kerygma**
 - The proclamation of the Christ-event; Bultmann's central hermeneutical category-doctrine should issue from this proclamation.
- **Demythologizing**
 - Method of interpreting mythic/apocalyptic language existentially; not denying the event but translating it into existential significance.
- **Christ-event**
 - The decisive historical act (death and resurrection) that constitutes Christian existence; anchors election and salvation.
- **Existential interpretation**
 - Reading texts for their disclosure of human existence before God rather than for metaphysical facts or timeless dogma.
- **Form criticism / Sitz im Leben**
 - Historical-critical tools used to situate Pauline traditions in communal proclamation-lives and to assess their original function.
- **Election**
 - For Bultmann, meaningful only within eschatological proclamation-God's choosing summons response, not promise of ethnic perpetuity.
- **Olive-tree metaphor / ingrafting (Romans 11)**
 - Read as Paul's theological argument: Gentile inclusion and the possibility of Jewish restoration are theological motifs pointing to God's eschatological freedom, not necessarily a literal national program.
- **Hardening / remnant**
 - Jewish hardness and the remnant language are interpretive devices to show that God's purposes operate through faithful minority and through the proclamation call.
- **Eschatology / apocalyptic**
 - Treated as proclamation language requiring existential translation to remain theologically relevant.
- **Justification by faith**
 - Interpreted existentially as participation in the Christ-event's verdict, not primarily as juridical imputation.
- **Law**
 - Functions to disclose human sinfulness, framing the need for the kerygma.
- **Faith**
 - Response to the proclamation; the existential stance that constitutes belonging to God's salvific act.
- **Remnant theology**
 - Reinterpreted as ecclesial-historical phenomenon within Paul's kerygma rather than ethnic survival.
- **How this work is used**
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar of reading Paul through kerygma and form-criticism.
 - As a **polemic resource**: weapon against literalist, dispensational, or nationalistic readings of Israel's future.
 - As a **definition source** for demythologizing and existential hermeneutics in theological method.
