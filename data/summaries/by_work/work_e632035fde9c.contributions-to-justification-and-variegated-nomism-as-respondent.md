### TITLE
Contributions to "Justification and Variegated Nomism" (as respondent) 
Author: Richard B. Gaffin Jr.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Response within the multi-author project Justification and Variegated Nomism (early-21st century scholarly debate responding to E. P. Sanders and the New Perspective on Paul).
 - Situated in the wider late-20th / early-21st century debate between traditional Reformed readings of Paul and proponents of the New Perspective (Sanders, Dunn, Wright).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - A defense of a classical Reformation/protestant construal of Pauline justification against key claims of the New Perspective: namely, that Paul's language is fundamentally forensic/declarative and that imputation (righteousness reckoned to the believer) is theologically necessary and exegetically defensible.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Methodological premiss: insistence on historical-grammatical exegesis within a confessional theological framework; caution about over-historicizing Paul into first-century Judaism categories.
 - Pauline semantics: defends traditional senses of dikaiosunē, charis, pistis, and logizomai as consistent with forensic and covenantal usage in Paul.
 - Imputation and union: argues that justification language coheres with the doctrine of union with Christ-righteousness is reckoned on the basis of Christ's obedience and imputed to believers.
 - Polemical moves: critiques NPP redefinitions of "works of the law" and of "righteousness" as communal/ covenantal markers that allegedly replace forensic soteriology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Direct interlocution with proponents of the New Perspective (E. P. Sanders, James D. G. Dunn, N. T. Wright) and with exegetical treatments of Romans and Galatians.
 - Uses Reformation and historic Reformed sources implicitly as theological warrant; appeals to canonical Pauline corpus for exegetical support.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Justification (forensic/declarative), imputation (legal reckoning), union with Christ (soteriological locus), faith and works, covenant and law, Pauline Christology and soteriology.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: Pauline justification is best understood as a forensic, imputed righteousness grounded in union with Christ, and this reading better preserves both the biblical texts and Reformation doctrinal convictions against the revisions proposed by the New Perspective.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong integration of forensic imputation with the doctrine of union with Christ rather than treating imputation as an isolated forensic mechanic.
 - Emphasis on canonical coherence across Paul rather than narrow social-historical reconstructions that relativize traditional terms.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors / rivals**
 - Corrects NPP tendencies to read Paul primarily as a boundary-maintenance theologian; insists Paul's primary concern is soteriological righteousness, not ethnic/community markers.
 - Challenges reinterpreting dikaiosunē as chiefly "covenantal status" without a forensic dimension.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Less innovation than reassertion: reframes and re-anchors familiar Reformation categories (imputation, forensic justification) within contemporary Pauline exegesis and modern methodological awareness.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within Reformed and conservative Evangelical circles as a robust scholarly defense of classic Protestant doctrine against NPP claims.
 - Cited in debates where exegetical precision and theological fidelity to Reformation categories are prized; less persuasive to proponents of the NPP.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a disciplined model for integrating exegesis and systematic theology; durable resource for teaching justification, imputation, and Paul's soteriology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification** - declared righteous status before God; defended here as fundamentally forensic/declarative.
- **Imputation** - the legal reckoning of Christ's righteousness to the believer (and sin to Christ in vicarious atonement discussions).
- **Union with Christ** - primary soteriological nexus: the believer's standing in Christ as the basis for imputation and participation.
- **Forensic / declarative language** - emphasis that Pauline verdicts are judicial pronouncements, not merely sociological statements.
- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)** - the scholarly movement reinterpreted by Gaffin; he critiques its redefinitions of key Pauline categories.
- **Variegated Nomism / Covenant Nomism** - scholarly background category contested: whether Judaism's covenantal framework undermines classic readings of "works-righteousness."
- **Works of the law** - phrase debated; Gaffin resists narrowing it to boundary markers and defends a broader polemical sense tied to human attempts to obtain covenant favor.
- **Dikaiosunē (righteousness)** - analyzed semantically and argued to retain forensic and soteriological force in Paul.
- **Logizomai / reckoning** - key verb for imputation arguments; Gaffin upholds its forensic import in Pauline contexts.
- **Faith (pistis)** - upheld as receptive, trust-related instrument by which believers receive justification; not simply covenantal allegiance.
- **Pauline Christology** - emphasized as controlling: Christ's obedience/death is the ontological ground for declared righteousness.
- **Covenant theology (background)** - implicit theological frame that supports imputation and forensic categories.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** and exemplar in debates against the New Perspective on Paul.
- As an **exegetical-theological model** for courses on Romans/Galatians linking exegesis to Reformation doctrine.
- As a **definition source** for imputation and forensic justification within Reformed teaching and confessional summaries.
