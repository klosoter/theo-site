### TITLE
The Confession of 1967: Its Theological Background and Ecumenical Significance - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 1960s: response to social upheaval (civil rights, war and social reform), the ecumenical movement, and theological currents shaped by neo-orthodoxy and Vatican II.
 - The Confession of 1967 (Presbyterian) sought to articulate a contemporary confession emphasizing reconciliation and the church's social engagement.
 - Van Til reads the Confession from a conservative Reformed, presuppositional standpoint.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Confession displays an ecumenical impulse and pastoral sensitivity toward reconciliation, but its theological language and doctrinal boundaries risk obscuring Reformed confessional commitments - particularly concerning revelation, Christology, and sacramental practice (notably the Lord's Supper and the disciplines of fencing and admission).

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Historical-theological genealogy: traces influences on the Confession (Westminster tradition, modern liberalism, Barthian correction, ecumenical consensus).
 - Theological analysis:
 - How the Confession handles revelation (Word and Spirit) and the place of propositional truth.
 - Christology and atonement: emphasis on reconciliation as center, but potential vagueness about substitutionary and covenantal contours.
 - Ecclesiology and sacraments: treatment of the Lord's Supper, Christ's presence, and church discipline.
 - Presuppositional critique: tests the Confession's categories against Reformed covenant theology and scriptural norms.
 - Practical implications: warnings about sacramental laxity (fencing and admission), and proposals to recover confessional clarity without negating pastoral concern.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Westminster Confession tradition (as standard of comparison), proponents of the 1967 Confession, and voices in neo-orthodoxy (e.g., Barthian emphases).
 - Secondary engagement with contemporary ecumenical documents and pastoral theology of the 1960s.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Word and Spirit), Christology and atonement (reconciliation), ecclesiology (nature and mission of the church), covenant theology, sacraments (Lord's Supper, presence of Christ), and pastoral discipline (fencing and admission).

- **Closing line**
 - Van Til presses for a confessional Reformed Christocentrism that preserves propositional revelation and sacramental-covenantal discipline while recognizing the pastoral urgency of reconciliation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Insistence that doctrinal clarity (propositional revelation) is the necessary foundation for genuine ecumenical witness and social engagement.
 - Reading the Confession through the lens of covenant continuity - not simply as ethical exhortation but as doctrinally anchored proclamation.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived drift toward existential or purely relational language by reasserting doctrinal precision about Christ's work.
 - Contrasts with liberal and some neo-orthodox readings that prioritize social concern over doctrinal boundaries.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Applies presuppositional methodological tools to the assessment of a modern confession: evaluating underlying worldview commitments rather than merely textual rhetoric.
 - Reframes "reconciliation" so that social and ecclesial dimensions are rooted in the atoning, covenantal work of Christ.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Found receptive audiences among conservative and confessional Presbyterians who viewed the 1967 Confession as theologically mutable.
 - Provoked further debate about the balance of pastoral care and confessional fidelity in North American Presbyterianism.
 - Less influence among ecumenically inclined theologians who prioritized pastoral framing and modern contextualization.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for critiquing ecumenical statements from a confessional Reformed standpoint.
 - Useful in seminary instruction on how confession, doctrine, and church polity interact, especially in sacramental practice and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Confession of 1967** - The contemporary Presbyterian confession under appraisal; characterized by emphasis on reconciliation and social witness.
- **Reconciliation** - Central theme of the 1967 text; Van Til insists it must be grounded in Christ's atonement and revelation.
- **Revelation (Word and Spirit)** - Van Til stresses propositional, objective revelation as the benchmark for doctrinal formulations.
- **Christocentrism** - Theological center; any social or ecclesial emphasis must be theologically rooted in the person and work of Christ.
- **Covenant theology / continuity** - Framework for assessing ecclesial identity, sacramental belonging, and the church's discipline.
- **Presence of Christ (Lord's Supper)** - Van Til defends a Reformed understanding of real, spiritual presence within covenant worship and opposes sacramental ambiguity.
- **Fencing and admission** - Church discipline governing sacramental participation; Van Til argues for careful doctrinally informed practice rather than open, unregulated admission.
- **Presuppositional apologetics** - Method applied to evaluate the Confession's underlying commitments and to test its coherentiveness with Scripture.
- **Ecumenical consensus** - The move toward common language across traditions; Van Til appreciates unity but warns against diluting doctrinal distinctives.
- **Confessional integrity** - The norm Van Til upholds: fidelity to Scripture mediated through historic confessions.
- **Social witness / public theology** - Recognized as necessary, but subordinated to doctrinal fidelity to avoid syncretistic formulations.
- **Pastoral theology** - Van Til urges that pastoral concern must not bypass sacramental and doctrinal disciplines.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed readings of modern confessional texts and for locating Christology at the center of public theology.
- As a **polemic and apologetic model** in debates over sacramental admission and confessional fidelity versus ecumenical accommodation.
- As an **exegetical-cum-polemical model** for teaching how doctrinal method (presuppositional critique) interrogates contemporary theological statements.
