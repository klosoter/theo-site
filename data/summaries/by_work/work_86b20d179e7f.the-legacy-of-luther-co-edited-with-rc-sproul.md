### TITLE
The Legacy of Luther (co-edited with R. C. Sproul) - Stephen J. Nichols 
A contemporary evangelical-reformation appraisal gathering essays on Martin Luther's enduring theological contribution, with particular attention to revelation (general and special) and the place of the Word in Protestant theology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st-century Protestant retrieval of Reformation theology; ecumenical conversation between Lutheran and Reformed traditions; shaped by evangelical confessional renewal and the influence of R. C. Sproul's pastoral-apologetic agenda.
 - Intended audience: pastors, scholars, and students engaged in doctrinal recovery and doctrinal application for preaching and apologetics.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Luther's theological legacy-especially his account of revelation and the primacy of the Word-remains decisive for Protestant identity: it corrects confidence in human reason and natural theology and centers salvation on God's self-revelation in Christ as mediated by Scripture and the Spirit.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Reassert Luther's fundamental categories (Gospel vs Law; Deus absconditus vs Deus revelatus; theologia crucis) as corrective to modern reliance on general revelation and autonomous reason.
 - Trace how Luther's insistence on Scripture, the Word-event, and Spirit-wrought faith shapes subsequent Protestant doctrines (justification, sacraments, preaching).
 - Show practical and pastoral consequences: preaching as proclamation, sacraments as means of grace, and theology as ministry under the Word.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Martin Luther (lectures, sermons, biblical commentaries, Heidelberg Disputation, Bondage of the Will).
 - Secondary: Augustine (legacy), medieval scholastics (contrast), Erasmus (debate), later Protestant respondents (Melanchthon, Lutheran orthodoxy), modern interpreters (R. C. Sproul, contemporary Reformed and Lutheran theologians).
 - Interlocutors: Roman Catholic retrievals, Enlightenment natural theology, modern liberal theology, and neo-orthodox/Barthian readings.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Revelation** (general vs special), Scripture (perspicuity and authority), justification by faith, theology of the cross, sacraments as means of grace, role of the Holy Spirit in illumination, law/gospel distinction.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Luther's theological center is a Word-centered, Spirit-enabled Gospel theology that privileges Christ revealed in Scripture over speculative reason and thus reframes revelation as a saving, not merely informative, encounter.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Sharp distinction between knowledge of God from creation (general revelation) and saving knowledge of God in Christ (special revelation); the former stirs natural piety but cannot effect salvation.
 - Theology of the cross as methodological corrective: true theology judges God by the cross, not by human wisdom or glory.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects medieval confidence in merits, sacramentalism as earning grace, and scholastic fusion of natural and revealed theology.
 - Pushes back against modern natural theology that claims autonomous access to God's salvific character apart from Christ.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Re-foregrounding of **Deus absconditus/Deus revelatus**, **theologia crucis**, and the category of the Word as an effective, not only propositional, encounter.
 - Emphasis on Scripture as a **means** (instrumentum) whereby God creates and sustains faith.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Strong impact on confessional Lutheranism and significant appropriation in Reformed circles; influential for contemporary evangelical preaching and apologetics (via figures like Sproul).
 - Used in ecumenical conversations to negotiate differences over revelation, sacraments, and justification.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a corrective framework for discerning the limits of natural theology, a robust model for Word-centered pastoral ministry, and a compact account of how revelation functions as saving encounter.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sola Scriptura** - Scripture as final norm and instrument of revelation; presupposes Spirit-led reception.
- **General revelation** - Knowledge of God in creation; real but insufficient for salvation; basis for natural theology debates.
 - Contrasted with special revelation: informative but non-salvific without Spirit and Christ.
- **Special revelation** - God's self-disclosure in Christ and Scripture; the ground of saving knowledge.
- **Theologia crucis (theology of the cross)** - Method that finds God's true self-revelation in the cross, not in glory or human wisdom.
- **Deus absconditus / Deus revelatus** - Hidden God vs revealed God; emphasizes paradox of God's hidden will and decisive revelation in Christ.
- **Word as means (verbum, instrumentum)** - The preached and written Word is the divine instrument that creates faith.
- **Perspicuity of Scripture** - Scripture's clarity for the faithful; hinges on Spirit-enabled reading.
- **Simul iustus et peccator** - Simultaneously justified and sinner; pastoral anthropology and soteriological realism.
- **Law and Gospel distinction** - Dual use: law convicts and drives to Christ; Gospel gives forgiveness and new life.
- **Means of grace** - Sacraments and preaching as vehicles of Christ's real presence and promise.
- **Illumination (Holy Spirit)** - Necessary for the Scripture to be efficacious; prevents purely rational appropriation.
- **Word-event** - Revelation as an event effecting faith, not merely propositional information.
- **Sola fide / sola gratia** - Justification by faith alone and grace alone as corollaries of Luther's revelatory emphasis.
- **Antithesis between reason and revelation** - Critical posture toward autonomous reason in theological matters.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Luther's doctrine of revelation (general vs special) in systematic treatments.
 - As a **polemic resource** against modern natural theology and optimistic human reason.
 - As an **exegetical/pastoral model** for preaching that centers Scripture and the cross as saving revelation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in ecumenical discussions negotiating Reformation and Roman Catholic claims about revelation and authority.
