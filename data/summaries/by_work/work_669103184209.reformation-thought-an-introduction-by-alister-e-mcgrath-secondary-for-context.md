### TITLE
Francis Turretin - Reformed Scholastic Ecclesiology (late 17th c.) 
Context note: treated here with secondary framing from Alister McGrath, Reformation Thought: An Introduction.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th-century Reformed scholasticism; Turretin (1623-1687) taught at the Geneva Academy and wrote within post‑Reformation confessional debates.
 - Reaction against Remonstrant/Arminian theology, Socinian denial of key doctrines, and perceived theological laxity; shaped by Calvinian legacy and the synodal controversies following Dort.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To defend a biblically grounded, confessional Reformed ecclesiology: the nature, marks, sacraments, ministry, and discipline of the church as the covenant community and vehicle of communion with Christ.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: classical elenctic scholastic structure - definitions, distinctions, objections, and refutations aimed at precise doctrinal formulation.
 - Major moves:
 - Define the church in both visible and invisible aspects and defend the theological coherence of this distinction.
 - Establish **marks of the true church** (preaching of the Word, right administration of the sacraments, and ecclesiastical discipline) as necessary identifiers.
 - Situate sacraments (Baptism and Eucharist) within covenant theology: sign‑seal functions, continuity of infant baptism, and Reformed understanding of Christ's presence.
 - Clarify ministry and office: ministerial priesthood, ordination, and relation to civil magistrate.
 - Address polity and discipline: authority to bind and loose, and limits of toleration and magistrate involvement.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages Calvinian tradition (Calvin, Beza), earlier Reformed scholastics (e.g., Ursinus, Gomarus), and contemporary adversaries: Arminians/Remonstrants, Socinians, and Roman Catholic positions.
 - Employs Scripture, Fathers selectively, and scholastic categories to systematize and polemicize.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (ecclesial implications), sacraments (nature, number, efficacy), Church (visible/invisible distinction), ministry and ordination, ecclesiastical discipline, church‑state relations, and communion of saints.
- **Closing line**
 - Turretin's ecclesiology centers on a confessional, covenantal church constituted and recognized by objective marks and entrusted with the means of grace under ordered ministry and disciplined life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Rigorous insistence on **objective marks** as the criterion for the true church, balanced with the invisible/inward reality of faith.
 - Precision in sacramental theology: strong covenantal sign‑seal language resisting both Catholic sacramentalism and Zwinglian minimalism.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived Roman excesses (sacerdotalism, sacramental ontology) and Remonstrant looseness (subjective criteria, downplaying of covenantal promises).
 - More juridical and scholastic in method than classical Reformation expositors; sharper polemic against contemporaries.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Use of refined scholastic categories (essence, property, relation) to ground ecclesial definitions - bringing systematic metaphysical precision to pastoral/ecclesial claims.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Cornerstone of later Reformed orthodoxy; influential for continental and Anglo‑American confessionalism, and a principal source for 18th-19th century Presbyterian identity (Princeton reception).
 - Revived in modern times through English translations and conservative Reformed catecheses.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplifies how confessional Reformed theology integrates covenantal anthropology, sacraments, and discipline; continues to be a pedagogical model for confessional ecclesiology and polemic against theological revisionism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible church / Invisible church**
 - Visible: concrete congregation with offices, sacraments, discipline; Invisible: elect known only to God. Both poles necessary for Turretin.
- **Marks of the church**
 - Preaching, sacraments, discipline - objective signs distinguishing true churches.
- **Covenant theology (ecclesial)**
 - Church as covenant household; sacraments as covenant seals and signs.
- **Sacraments: sign and seal**
 - Two sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper); convey and confirm covenant grace, including infant baptism.
- **Paedobaptism**
 - Defended on covenantal and typological grounds (children of believers included in covenant).
- **Elenctic method**
 - Scholastic disputational method: thesis, objections, refutation - central to Turretin's theological pedagogy.
- **Ministerial priesthood / ordination**
 - Distinction from sacerdotalism; ministers as ordained stewards of Word and sacraments.
- **Ecclesiastical discipline / keys**
 - Authority to bind and loose; necessary for church purity and the exercise of the marks.
- **Church and magistrate**
 - Reformed posture: magistrate has a role in preserving public religion and order, within limits; not totalizing Erastianism but cooperative.
- **Means of grace**
 - Word and sacraments as ordinary instruments by which God effects communion with Christ in the church.
- **Confessional subscription**
 - High value on creedal/confessional standards as controls for doctrinal orthodoxy.
- **Communion of saints**
 - Real spiritual union grounded in Christ and expressed in covenantal and sacramental life.
- **Polemic against Remonstrants / Socinians**
 - Uses ecclesiology to rebut subjectivist and anti‑Trinitarian tendencies.
- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: precise formulations of church and sacraments for confessional manuals.
 - Polemic model: exemplar for arguing against theological revisionism (Arminianism, Socinianism).
 - Pastoral/exegetical: a working schema for covenantal sacramentology and discipline in Reformed congregational life.
