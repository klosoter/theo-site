### TITLE
Amillennialism - chapter by Kim Riddlebarger in Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond (1999, ed. Darrell L. Bock)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century evangelical debate over eschatology; volume juxtaposes three competing paradigms (amillennial, premillennial, postmillennial).
 - Riddlebarger's contribution articulates a classical Reformed/amillennial position situated in covenantal and inaugurated-eschatological theology, reacting especially to dispensational premillennialism and literalist readings of Revelation 20.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The "thousand years" of Revelation 20 is symbolic: Christ presently reigns in the church between his first and second comings; there is no future earthly golden-age millennial kingdom distinct from the present age and final state.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Hermeneutical groundwork: argues for a typological/symbolic reading of apocalyptic literature (esp. Revelation), cautioning against a simple literalism that divorces genre and canonical theology.
 - Exegesis of Revelation 20:
 - "Binding of Satan" = restraint of satanic power enabling gospel advance, not total impotence.
 - "Thousand years" = symbolic numeral indicating fullness/eschatological era (the church age); "first resurrection" refers to spiritual life of believers, not two separate bodily resurrections separated by a millennial interval.
 - "Release" and final rebellion = brief culmination before Christ's visible return and final judgment.
 - Theological integration:
 - Connects Revelation 20 to the already/not-yet kingdom inaugurated in Christ (kingdom now present in mystery, to be consummated in parousia).
 - Advocates single final resurrection and judgment at Christ's return; denies a distinct postmortem millennial reign of resurrected saints on earth.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on patristic precedent (Augustine as primary historical advocate of non-literal millennium), Reformed covenantal interpreters, and critiques of modern dispensationalists and premillennial literalists.
 - Engages contemporary millennialists in the volume and broader evangelical literature on Revelation 20.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (eschatological hermeneutics), Christology (two comings; present reign), resurrection(s), final judgment, Satanology (binding and release), covenant theology, ecclesiology (church as locus of the present kingdom).
- **Closing line**
 - Riddlebarger grounds amillennialism in a canonically informed, covenantal reading of Revelation 20: the millennium is the present, symbolic reign of Christ in and through the church until his return and the final resurrection-judgment.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong stress on canonical and covenantal coherence: Revelation 20 must be read in light of the gospels and Pauline eschatology (already/not-yet), not extracted as a free-standing chronological charter for history.
 - Clarifies the "first resurrection" language as primarily spiritual/representative rather than proof of a two-stage bodily resurrection scheme.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges dispensationalist literalism that maps Revelation 20 into a future earthly reign with a separate Israel-church program.
 - Counters postmillennial optimism by refusing to equate church progress with ultimate consummation; also resists historic premillennial partitioning of redemptive-historical stages.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reiterates and refines the use of "binding" as contemporaneous restraint (not annihilation) and "thousand years" as symbolic fullness - framed within covenant/inauguration language rather than mere numerology.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valuable within Reformed and evangelical circles as a clear, accessible defense of classical amillennial positions against popular dispensational readings.
 - Widely cited in surveys and classroom settings as a concise, exegetically aware presentation of amillennialism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Serves as a compact model of integrating exegesis of apocalyptic text with systematic theology (eschatology, covenant, Christology); useful for pastors and advanced students seeking a measured, canonical approach.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Amillennialism** - The view that the "thousand years" is symbolic and that Christ's reign is present now in the church between his comings.
- **Thousand years (Rev 20)** - Interpreted symbolically as the era of the church (eschatological fullness), not a literal chronological future reign.
- **Binding of Satan** - The restraining of satanic power so the gospel advances; not total removal of devil's agency.
- **First resurrection** - Understood primarily as spiritual/vocational (believers' new life) in the present age; not proof of a separate earthly, postmortem reign.
- **Inaugurated eschatology / already-not-yet** - Kingdom is already inaugurated in Christ; consummation awaits his return.
- **Single final resurrection** - Bodily resurrection and final judgment occur at Christ's parousia, not separated by a millennium.
- **Hermeneutic of apocalyptic** - Reads Revelation as symbolic/typological within canonical theology rather than purely literal chronological forecasting.
- **Covenantal framing** - Interprets millennial motifs within covenantal history and the unity of the people of God (church as locus of present reign).
- **Consummation / parousia** - Final visible return of Christ that concludes the era described in Rev 20, followed by judgment and new creation.
- **Realized aspects of salvation** - Elements of resurrection and reign experienced now through union with Christ, sanctification, and church ministry.
- **Satan's release** - A brief eschatological episode permitting a final rebellion prior to judgment; consistent with symbolic reading.
- **Ecclesiology as locus of kingdom** - Emphasis that the church, not a future earthly polity, is the primary manifestation of Christ's present reign.
- **Literal vs. symbolic** - Riddlebarger privileges genre-informed symbolic interpretation for apocalyptic texts.
- **Millennial chronology** - Rejected as a future, visible thousand-year earthly epoch in favor of a present-age symbolic era.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a concise **definition-source** for classical amillennialism in encyclopedias, syllabi, and introductory essays.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20 within canonical and covenantal frameworks (often cited in critiques of dispensational literalism).
- As a **polemic** tool in debates with premillennial and dispensational interpreters, especially on the meaning of "thousand years" and the binding of Satan.
