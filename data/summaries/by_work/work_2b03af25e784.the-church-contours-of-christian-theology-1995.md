### TITLE
**The Church** (Contours of Christian Theology, 1995) - Edmund P. Clowney

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical and Reformed milieu; post-Vatican II ecumenism and church-growth pragmatism in view.
 - Part of IVP's Contours series; integrates classic Reformed ecclesiology with biblical-theological method.
- **Central thesis**
 - The church is the covenant people of God, united to the risen Christ and indwelt by the Spirit, manifesting the kingdom through the Word and sacraments in gathered worship and scattered mission.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - **Biblical-theological foundations:** Christ fulfills Israel; the church as temple, body, bride; continuity/discontinuity across covenants (Christ In Ot And Nt).
 - **Nature and attributes:** One, holy, catholic, apostolic grounded in the triune mission and apostolic gospel (One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church).
 - **Marks and order:** The church is recognized by Word, sacraments, discipline; instituted offices serve Christ's rule (Nature And Marks Of The Church).
 - **Means of grace:** Primacy of preaching; baptism and the Lord's Supper as covenant signs; prayer as priestly service (Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer).
 - **Church and kingdom:** Distinction without separation; the church as firstfruits and instrument of the kingdom (Church And Kingdom).
 - **Mission, worship, and discipline:** Great Commission, doxological center, catechesis, and corrective nurture.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Scripture read via Vos-Ridderbos biblical theology; Reformed confessions (Belgic, Westminster); Calvin, Bavinck, Kuyper, Murray.
 - Engages Rome (sacramental hierarchy), Anabaptist and Free-Church ecclesiologies, ecumenical proposals (e.g., post-Vatican II), and Dulles-models typologies.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity and mission; Christology and union with Christ; covenant theology; pneumatology and gifts; sacramentology; eschatology of the kingdom; authority and polity.
- **Closing line**
 - The church lives from the Word of the crucified-and-risen Lord, by the Spirit, as a pilgrim-temple of the kingdom, gathered to worship and sent to witness.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong biblical-theological typology: temple, body, bride integrate ontology, worship, and mission.
 - Covenant unity of Scripture shapes ecclesial identity, sacraments, and catechesis.
 - The **means of grace** orient ministry practice; preaching is the Spirit's primary instrument.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Against Roman Catholicism: rejects ontological identification of church with the kingdom and sacerdotal hierarchy; affirms evangelical catholicity grounded in the apostolic gospel.
 - Against individualism/pragmatism: resists church-growth technique as an alternative to Word-and-sacrament ministry; recovers discipline and catechesis.
 - Nuances Barthian actualism by rooting church being in covenantal promise and instituted means.
- **Conceptual or terminological moves**
 - Re-centers unity and mission in the triune sending: Father sends Son and Spirit who constitute the church.
 - Clarifies visible/invisible church without dual ecclesiologies; one church viewed under two aspects.
 - Church as outpost and firstfruits of the kingdom, not the kingdom in toto.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard seminary text in Reformed circles; shaped evangelical preaching and church-planting that emphasize Word-centered worship and mission.
 - Read alongside Ridderbos on the kingdom and Dulles on models; appreciated for clarity and catholic breadth within Reformed bounds.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a coherent, Scripture-saturated ecclesiology that is pastorally actionable and missionally alert while confessional and sacramental.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One Holy Catholic Apostolic Church**
 - Four attributes grounded in the triune God and apostolic gospel; unity in truth, holiness by consecration, catholicity as global fullness, apostolicity in doctrine and mission.
- **Nature and marks of the church**
 - True church recognized by pure preaching, right administration of sacraments, and faithful discipline; attributes describe being, marks identify recognition (Nature And Marks Of The Church).
- **Church and kingdom**
 - Kingdom is God's redemptive reign; the church is its community-sign and instrument, anticipating consummation without collapsing the two (Church And Kingdom).
- **Means of grace: preaching, sacraments, prayer**
 - Spirit-appointed instruments to create and sustain faith; preaching central, sacraments seal the promise, prayer exercises priestly access (Means Of Grace Preaching Sacraments Prayer).
- **Visible / invisible church**
 - Visible in gathered assemblies and profession; invisible as the elect known to God; two aspects of the one church, safeguarding both humility and hope.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Soteriological and ecclesial center; by the Spirit believers share Christ's life, gifts, and mission; grounds sacramental participation.
- **Temple, body, bride**
 - Metaphors that coordinate presence, unity, holiness, and love; temple highlights indwelling Spirit, body mutuality, bride consecration and eschatological communion.
- **Covenant community**
 - Ecclesial identity derives from covenant promise and obligation; sacraments as covenant signs and seals.
- **Offices: elders and deacons**
 - Christ rules by the Word through ordained servants; Presbyterian parity of elders; diaconate embodies mercy and service.
- **Baptism**
 - Initiatory sign of union with Christ and covenant inclusion; includes believers and their children; calls to faith and obedience.
- **Lord's Supper**
 - Spiritual presence of Christ to faith; communion with the risen Lord and with one another; eschatological foretaste.
- **Worship and Lord's Day**
 - Word-governed, Christ-centered liturgy; Lord's Day as creational-redemptive rhythm for the gathered church.
- **Mission and evangelism**
 - Church sent to disciple the nations; mission arises from worship and is enacted by Word and deed under ecclesial oversight.
- **Discipline and catechesis**
 - Formative and corrective care to guard holiness and truth; essential to the church's credible witness.
- **Christ in OT and NT**
 - Hermeneutical key for ecclesiology: Christ's fulfillment of Israel shapes identity, mission, and sacramental life (Christ In Ot And Nt).

- **How this work is used**
 - Definition source for ecclesial attributes, marks, and means across systematic loci.
 - Conceptual pivot for relating soteriology and mission via union with Christ and the kingdom.
 - Exegetical model for typological reading that grounds ecclesiology in Scripture.
 - Polemical and irenic reference in ecumenical and confessional dialogues about unity and sacramental practice.
