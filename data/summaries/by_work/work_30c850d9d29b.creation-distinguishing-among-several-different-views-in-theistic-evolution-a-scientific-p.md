### TITLE
Creation: Distinguishing Among Several Different Views (chapter) - Wayne Grudem 
From: Theistic Evolution: A Scientific, Philosophical, and Theological Critique (early 21st-century evangelical response)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 21st-century evangelical engagement with rising acceptance of evolutionary accounts among Christians. Part of an edited volume that brings conservative theologians and philosophers together to critique theistic evolution. Embedded in broader debates over biblical inerrancy, hermeneutics, and the integrity of classical Christian doctrines.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** 
 - Precise distinctions among competing views of origins are necessary because different readings of Genesis entail markedly different theological consequences; in particular, theistic evolution is argued to be incompatible with a historically real Adam and the doctrines of sin and redemption.
- **Core argument / structure:** 
 - Taxonomy: defines and distinguishes major positions (young-earth creationism, old-earth variants, day-age, gap, framework, analogical-day, theistic evolution). 
 - Exegesis: evaluates key Genesis texts (Genesis 1-3) and the New Testament's appeal to a historical Adam. Argues for a plain/historical reading as normatively required for orthodox doctrine. 
 - Theological consequences: traces implications for original sin, the universality of death, the atonement, and human uniqueness if one adopts evolutionary ancestry or non-historical Adam. 
 - Philosophical/scientific cross-checks: notes where scientific claims are evidentially strong or uncertain, but insists theological commitments must govern interpretation of Scripture. 
 - Conclusion: urges rejection of theistic evolution on doctrinal grounds while clarifying differences among non-evolutionary alternatives.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Engages broadly with proponents of theistic evolution and old-earth reconciliations (contemporary evangelical scientists/philosophers) and with internal creationist alternatives. Uses Scripture, historic creedal formulations, and contemporary scientific claims as interlocutory material.
- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Creation (ex nihilo and divine fiat), revelation and biblical authority/inerrancy, anthropology (human origin and status), original sin and federal headship of Adam, soteriology (atonement), providence.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** 
 - Hermeneutical choices about Genesis are not neutral: affirming a historical Adam and a non-evolutionary reading preserves the theological architecture of sin and redemption, whereas theistic evolution threatens the doctrinal center of classical evangelicalism.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Presents a clear, theologically driven taxonomy of views rather than merely surveying scientific arguments; repeatedly foregrounds the doctrinal fallout (Adam, sin, atonement) as decisive.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:** 
 - Challenges theistic evolutionists who separate scientific plausibility from theological necessity; insists that accommodationist readings often concede too much to naturalistic accounts and thereby undermine Scripture's plain sense.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Refines practical categories to help pastors and students distinguish subtle variants (e.g., distinguishing theistic evolution proper from other old-earth approaches that still insist on a historical Adam).
- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Adopted widely in conservative and Reformed evangelical circles as a clarifying summary and polemic against theistic evolution; used in seminary classrooms for sharpening the debate on Adam and original sin.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Useful as a compact guide that links biblical exegesis directly to systematic implications; durable as a pedagogical tool for teaching why origins debates matter doctrinally, not merely scientifically.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Young-Earth Creationism (YEC):** literal six 24-hour days; recent creation; affirms historical Adam and universality of death post-Fall. 
- **Old-Earth Creationism (OEC):** accepts an old earth while rejecting evolutionary common descent for humans; includes day-age and gap variants. 
- **Theistic Evolution (TE):** God guides evolutionary processes; often denies or reinterprets a historical Adam, which Grudem identifies as the main theological problem. 
- **Day-Age View:** "days" as long ages; attempts to harmonize geological time with Genesis sequencing; criticized for weakening narrative immediacy. 
- **Gap Theory:** a temporal gap between Genesis 1:1 and 1:2 allowing pre-Adamic death; argued to be theologically problematic in Grudem's frame. 
- **Framework Hypothesis / Analogical Days:** Genesis 1 as literary/analogical framework; preserves theological truths while denying chronological sequence-Grudem stresses risks to historicity. 
- **Historical Adam:** Adam as real historical person and federal head; central for original sin and New Testament typology-non-negotiable in Grudem's argument. 
- **Original Sin / Federal Headship:** doctrine that Adam's sin is imputed to humanity; collapse of historic Adam threatens this doctrinal structure. 
- **Inerrancy / Plain Sense Hermeneutic:** commitment to Scripture's truthfulness and the default interpretation of Genesis as historical narrative. 
- **Divine Fiat / Creation Ex Nihilo:** God creates by command; theological claim used to rebut naturalistic explanations of origins. 
- **Atonement Implications:** link between death, sin, and Christ's redemptive act; pre-Adamic death complicates penal substitution readings. 
- **Concordism vs. Non-Concordism:** attempts to align Genesis with modern science (concordism) vs. reading Genesis on its own theological terms (non-concordist).
- **Use across loci:** 
 - As a definitional source for taxonomy of views on creation; 
 - As polemic evidence in apologetic and doctrinal defenses of a historical Adam and against theistic evolution; 
 - As an exegetical model privileging a plain reading of Genesis that informs systematic treatments of sin and soteriology.
