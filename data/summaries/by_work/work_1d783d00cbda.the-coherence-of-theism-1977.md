### TITLE
The Coherence of Theism (1977) - Richard Swinburne

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late-20th-century analytic philosophy of religion. Swinburne writes from an Anglophone, empiricist-influenced analytic tradition aiming to rehabilitate classical theism against mid-century logical critiques. Precedes his later probabilistic apologetics (Is There a God?).
- **Central thesis:** The propositions constitutive of classical theism (God as omnipotent, omniscient, perfectly good, creator, etc.) are logically coherent and constitute an intellectually respectable description of a single being; moreover, theism yields a simple, explanatorily powerful hypothesis for certain features of the world.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - First, articulate the essential divine attributes as theoretical predicates (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, aseity, eternity, simplicity).
 - Second, test for internal contradictions (e.g., omnipotence paradoxes; omniscience vs. human freedom) and offer analytical solutions that preserve traditional intuitions.
 - Third, defend theism as a plausible explanatory hypothesis by appeal to **simplicity** and **explanatory scope** (theism as a unifying hypothesis for cosmological facts, moral facts, consciousness).
 - Fourth, address objections (logical problem of evil, the unpredictability of divine action) and show theism remains coherent and reasonably defensible.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical theists (Aquinas), Humean skeptics, modern analytic philosophers (e.g., Alvin Plantinga on free will and modal issues), critics of omnipotence paradoxes. Engages philosophical logic and metaphysics more than biblical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Divine attributes (omnipotence, omniscience, omnibenevolence, eternity, simplicity, aseity), creation (as explanation), providence and human freedom (compatibility), theodicy (coherence of divine goodness with evil).
- **Closing line:** Swinburne aims less to prove God exists than to show that classical theism is a coherent, simple, and explanatorily powerful hypothesis that survives standard philosophical objections.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong appeal to **theoretical virtues** (especially simplicity) as criteria for preferring theism among metaphysical hypotheses.
 - Treats divine predicates as unified into a single hypothesis rather than as isolated attributes to be separately proved.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors:**
 - Moves away from purely deductive "proofs" for God; instead emphasizes coherence and comparative explanatory merit against naturalistic alternatives.
 - Responds to mid-century attacks that treated divine attributes as prima facie contradictory by offering technical, analytic reconciliations (e.g., reformulations of omnipotence, modal accounts of foreknowledge and freedom).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Operationalizes classical theism within analytic metaphysics: treats attributes as theoretical entities with implicit counterfactual and modal bearings.
 - Systematizes the use of **simplicity-as-prior** in metaphysical probability assessments (precursor to his later Bayesian work).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Highly influential in analytic philosophy of religion; re-legitimized serious philosophical engagement with classical theism.
 - Sparked sustained debate over simplicity, priors, and the proper standards for metaphysical explanation.
 - Mixed reception in theological circles: welcomed by many conservative and Reformed apologists as a philosophical defense; critiqued by some theologians for downplaying historical revelation and ecclesial doctrine.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Serves as a clear, rigorous statement that classical divine attributes need not be abandoned for theism to remain viable.
 - Valuable as a methodological exemplar: how to bring analytic rigor to theology while focusing on coherence and explanatory virtues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Coherence (of theism):** Central claim that the set of divine predicates is internally consistent and intelligible.
- **Omnipotence:** Reinterpreted to avoid paradoxes (e.g., ability limited to logically possible acts), not brute absolutism.
- **Omniscience:** Treated in modal terms; reconciled with human free will by careful temporal/modal distinctions.
- **Omnibenevolence:** Considered in relation to the problem of evil; shown not to entail trivial outcomes about the absence of evil.
- **Aseity:** God's self-existence; used to ground ultimate explanations and to secure simplicity.
- **Simplicity (theoretical virtue):** Elevated to a decisive epistemic criterion for prior probability and choice between metaphysical hypotheses.
- **Explanatory power / unification:** Theism as a unifying hypothesis explaining cosmos, consciousness, moral values better than rivals.
- **Providence & freedom:** Analytic account of how divine foreknowledge and providential action could coexist with genuine creaturely freedom.
- **Modal logic / possible worlds:** Employed as tools to show compatibility and coherence of attributes.
- **Problem of Evil / Theodicy:** Treated as challenge but not decisive against coherence; argues for plausible reconciliatory strategies.
- **Prior probability:** Early deployment of probabilistic intuition about metaphysical hypotheses (anticipates later Bayesian treatment).
- **Metaphysical simplicity vs. ontological parsimony:** Distinguishes explanatory simplicity from strict ontological minimalism.
- **Theism as hypothesis:** Theistic claims presented and defended as empirically informed metaphysical hypotheses rather than purely revealed propositions.
- **Divine simplicity (classical):** Reframed to meet analytic objections while retaining theological import.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for clear analytic formulations of classical divine attributes.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in apologetics: supplies the methodological move from logical impossibility to explanatory plausibility.
- As a **polemic** against eliminativist or revisionist accounts that deem classical theism incoherent; used in curricula for philosophy of religion and systematic theology.
