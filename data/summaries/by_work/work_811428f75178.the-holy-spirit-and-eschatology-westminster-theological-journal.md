### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "The Holy Spirit and Eschatology," Westminster Theological Journal** 

(Article-length, Reformed/evangelical theological context; engages pneumatology in light of inaugurated eschatology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Mid- to late-20th-century Reformed theological debate: reaction to both neo-orthodox and charismatic emphases; conversation with Barth, Moltmann, and Pentecostal scholarship.
 - Gaffin writes from a confessional Reformed vantage shaped by Vosian biblical theology and the Westminster tradition.

- **Central thesis**
 - The Holy Spirit is the eschatological agent of the new creation whose presence is already operative in the church and believer; this presence is normative, Word-bound, covenantal, and governs our understanding of gifts, sacraments, and Scripture.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Establishes biblical and theological basis for **inaugurated eschatology**: the kingdom has come in Christ but awaits consummation.
 - Locates the Spirit as the principal eschatological power who effects the present realization of redemptive promises (life, sanctification, union with Christ) and guarantees their completion.
 - Insists on the **unity of Spirit and Word**: Spirit's work is chiefly mediated through the preached Word and sacraments, not detached private phenomena.
 - Engages controversies:
 - Cautions against unbridled charismatic individualism and experientialism.
 - Critiques extreme cessationism for failing to account for Spirit's abiding eschatological presence.
 - Concludes with implications for ecclesiology (the church as the locus of Spirit-work), sacramentology (sacraments as Spirit-ordained means), and bibliology (Spirit attests Scripture).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Uses Scripture, Reformation and post-Reformation Reformed authors (Vos, Calvin, Warfield) and dialogues with Karl Barth, Jürgen Moltmann, and contemporary charismatic/cessationist writers.
 - Interacts with philosophical-theological concerns raised by Van Til style epistemology regarding Scripture's self-attestation and the Spirit's role.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology** (primary), **Eschatology** (inaugurated/realized), **Christology** (Spirit mediates Christ's benefits; relation to hypostatic union), **Ecclesiology** and **Sacramentology**, **Bibliology** (self-attestation of Scripture), doctrines of sin and sanctification.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The Spirit is the sovereign eschatological executor of Christ's saving work: present as the pledge and power of the coming new creation, always operative in, through, and under the Word and sacraments to form the church in union with Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong, Reformed articulation of **Spirit-as-eschatological-actor** that resists neat binaries (charismatic vs. cessationist) by emphasizing Word‑and‑sacrament mediation.
 - Clear linking of **inaugurated eschatology** to ordinary means of grace rather than to exceptional experiential signs.

- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Corrects charismatic tendencies that privatize or dislocate the Spirit from covenantal means.
 - Challenges cessationist tendencies that relegates the Spirit to historical rather than present eschatological agency.
 - Contrasts with Moltmann's emphasis on future eschatology by stressing present eschatological reality in Christ.

- **Conceptual/terminological moves**
 - Reframes pneumatology within a covenantal‑eschatological grammar: the Spirit as **arrabon/pledge** and **new-creation agent**.
 - Emphasizes **Spirit-Word unity** as a normative theological axiom.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed seminary curricula and scholarly literature as a balanced model for integrating pneumatology with covenantal and sacramental theology.
 - Influential among conservative Presbyterians wrestling with charismatic renewal and biblical authority issues.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a durable exegetical and theological framework for teaching on the Spirit that honors Scripture, the confessions, and contemporary pastoral realities.
 - Serves as a bridge between strict confessionalism and pastoral responsiveness to charismatic phenomena.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - The kingdom is present in Christ's work yet awaits consummation; Spirit effects the "already" realities.
- **Already / Not Yet**
 - Tension governing sanctification, redemption, and ecclesial life; Gaffin emphasizes substantial present realities secured by the Spirit.
- **Spirit as arrabon (pledge/guarantee)**
 - The Spirit is the down‑payment of final redemption; present assurance and efficacy.
- **Spirit‑Word unity**
 - The principle that the Spirit ordinarily works through preaching and sacraments; resists privatized manifestations.
- **New creation**
 - Eschatological category: Spirit brings about new-covenant reality now.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central soteriological locus; Spirit is the personal agent effecting and sustaining this union.
- **Sacramental efficacy**
 - Sacraments are Spirit‑ordained means by which eschatological benefits are applied.
- **Charismatic gifts / Continuationism vs. Cessationism**
 - Gaffin navigates between extremes: affirms Spirit's normative presence and real gifts while restraining unchecked experientialism and denying premature doctrinal closure.
- **Self‑attestation of Scripture**
 - Spirit's role in Scripture's authority and the believer's recognition of Scripture as Word.
- **Hypostatic union / Kenosis**
 - Discusses implications of Christology for pneumatology; critiques models that dissociate Spirit from Christ's ongoing lordship.
- **Church as eschatological community**
 - The church is the present locus of Spirit's new-creation work; relates to marks and polity implicitly.

How this work is used:
- **Definition source** for a Reformed, covenantal pneumatology centered on inaugurated eschatology.
- **Polemic resource** in debates with both charismatic excesses and strict cessationism.
- **Exegetical model** for linking Pauline and Johannine texts on Spirit with covenantal and sacramental theology.
- **Conceptual pivot** in teaching union with Christ, sacramental theology, and bibliology (Spirit's role in Scripture's authority).
