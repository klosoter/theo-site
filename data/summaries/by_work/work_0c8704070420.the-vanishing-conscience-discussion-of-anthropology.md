### TITLE
The Vanishing Conscience - John F. MacArthur

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 20th-century American conservative evangelical milieu (published and circulated in the 1990s). Responds to cultural shifts from the 1960s onward: sexual revolution, legal changes (abortion, euthanasia), rising moral relativism, and therapeutic/psychiatric paradigms that displaced biblical morality. MacArthur writes as a pastor-theologian within a conservative Reformed/evangelical and dispensational context.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Western conscience is collapsing because the biblical standard for moral judgment has been displaced by autonomy, relativism, and secular humanism. The result is ethical drift, social permissiveness, and personal moral deadening; only Scripture-grounded formation can recover a healthy conscience.
- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Define conscience biblically: an internal moral faculty created by God but corrupted by sin and susceptible to reformation through Scripture and sanctification.
 - Diagnose causes of erosion: philosophical naturalism, moral relativism, therapeutic culture, modern psychology, antinomian tendencies within the church, and willful suppression of truth (cf. Romans).
 - Show moral consequences: diminished guilt, public immorality, legal changes reflecting cultural decline, and a church ill-equipped for faithful witness.
 - Prescribe remedies: robust proclamation of Scripture, pastoral accountability, catechesis in objective moral law, and disciplined sanctification that re-educates conscience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Heavy reliance on biblical texts (Pauline ethics, pastoral epistles), frequent appeal to Reformational emphases (sola scriptura, total depravity), and critique of modern secular thinkers and pastoral trends; occasional patristic/Reformation references as precedents for conscience formation.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (nature and corruption of conscience), hamartiology (sin's effect on moral perception), soteriology/sanctification (regeneration's role in reforming conscience), theology of Scripture (authority and sufficiency for conscience), ecclesiology (discipline and pastoral care), and ethics (public and private morality).
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Conscience is not an autonomous arbiter but a God-given faculty meant to be formed and governed by Scripture; without Scripture-shaped conscience, personal holiness and public morality will continue to vanish.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Popularizes the image of the "vanishing conscience" to describe cultural moral decline.
 - Stresses the forensic and formative role of Scripture in conscience reformation rather than appealing to autonomous moral intuition.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Polemically opposes liberal Protestant claims that conscience trumps textual authority and opposes modern therapeutic/psychological models that privatize morality.
 - Critiques Roman Catholic and some Anglican emphases that elevate conscience as a locus of moral authority detached from Scripture (while not engaging dense Roman Catholic moral theology in full).
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations:**
 - Recurrent use of the metaphor **"seared conscience"** (drawing on 1 Tim 4:2) as a cultural diagnosis rather than only individual pathology.
 - Frames cultural malaise as not merely ignorance but active suppression of truth (a moral-theological diagnosis).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in conservative evangelical preaching, church discipline, and cultural-apologetic ministry; resonated with pastors confronting pastoral ethics and public witness.
 - Criticized by some theologians and ethicists for insufficient nuance on conscience pluralism and for a perceived tendency toward legalism or heavy-handed pastoral prescriptions.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Practical pastoral resource on conscience formation and cultural ethics.
 - Useful as a clear evangelical model linking biblical anthropology to public morality and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Conscience:** The God-given internal moral faculty for approving or condemning actions; can be enlightened, seared, or wounded; must be formed by Scripture.
- **Seared conscience:** A conscience rendered insensitive by habitual sin or cultural forces (borrows biblical language to diagnose social moral numbness).
- **Moral relativism:** The belief that moral truth is contingent or subjective; identified as a primary cultural threat to conscience.
- **Objective moral law:** The claim that moral norms are divinely ordained and knowable; MacArthur insists conscience must align with this law as revealed in Scripture.
- **Sola Scriptura (Scripture authority):** Scripture as the definitive guide and corrective for conscience; normative in formation and adjudication of moral questions.
- **Sanctification:** The Spirit-worked process that renews conscience through instruction, discipline, and repentance.
- **Antinomianism:** The tendency to dismiss moral law under the guise of grace; treated as an internal ecclesial cause of conscience erosion.
- **Therapeutic culture:** The modern emphasis on self-fulfillment and emotional autonomy that undermines objective moral instruction.
- **Suppressing truth:** A Pauline concept (Rom) used to explain societal culpability in abandoning conscience.
- **Pastoral accountability:** Institutional mechanisms (preaching, catechesis, discipline) for conscience reformation.
- **Public morality:** The extension of individual conscience issues into law and civic policy; MacArthur links private conscience to public consequences.
- **Guilt vs. compunction:** Distinguishes mere social guilt from biblical conviction leading to repentance.
- **Formation vs. autonomy:** Contrast between a conscience formed by external revelation and a self-authored conscience.
- **Use across loci:**
 - As a definitional source for an evangelical, Scripture-centric account of conscience in moral theology.
 - As a polemic tool against moral relativism, therapeutic ethics, and ecclesial laxity.
 - As a pastoral-exegetical model for preaching on sin, repentance, and the role of Scripture in moral formation.
