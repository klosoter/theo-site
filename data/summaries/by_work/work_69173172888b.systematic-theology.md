### TITLE
**Systematic Theology** 
Author: **Unknown** (anonymous or composite); aligns with **classical Reformed Protestant** doctrinal framework. 
Site usage: five internal references applied to the loci **Visible and Invisible Church; Law-Gospel; Spirit and Union with Christ; Christ's Active and Passive Obedience; Communicatio Idiomatum**.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Anonymous work; stylistically and doctrinally situated within post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy (confessional/17th-19th century theological grammar), though precise dating and authorship are uncertain.
 - Intended for clergy and educated laity: didactic, locus-by-locus arrangement typical of systematics used in seminaries and presbyterial instruction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To present a coherent, confessional account of Christian doctrine that secures salvation by Christ alone while ordering the church and life under Scripture, especially by clarifying how law, gospel, Spirit, and Christ's obedience function together in salvation and the church.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Prolegomena and Scripture (authority and interpretation).
 - Doctrine of God and the Trinity.
 - Christology: incarnation, **communicatio idiomatum**, active and passive obedience.
 - Soteriology: union with Christ (instrumental and mystical dimensions), justification, sanctification.
 - Pneumatology: role of the Spirit in effecting and applying redemption (union, assurance).
 - Ecclesiology: visible vs. invisible church; means of grace and sacraments.
 - Moral theology: law-gospel distinction and its pastoral application.
 - Eschatology and final judgment.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Scripture, Reformed confessions (implicitly), classical scholastics and Protestant scholastic method; engages Lutheran distinctions (particularly on communicatio idiomatum and active/passive obedience), Roman Catholic soteriology, and pastoral controversies about assurance and church discipline.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture; Trinity; Christology; atonement (active/passive obedience); Spirit and union with Christ; justification by faith; sanctification; covenant theology; ecclesiology (visible/invisible church); sacramental theology; law-gospel relation.
- **Closing line**
 - Presents a confessional Reformed center of gravity: **salvation is accomplished by Christ's full obedience (active and passive), applied by the Spirit in union with Christ, received by faith, and organized visibly in the church under Scripture and the rightly distinguished law and gospel.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sharp integration of **union with Christ** as the pivot between forensic justification and experiential sanctification: union is both legal (alien-imputation/location) and vital (Spirit-wrought participation).
 - Robust distinction and pastoral application of **law and gospel**-law retains civil/reflective uses while gospel alone delivers justification.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived Lutheran conflations by clarifying communicatio idiomatum so that Christ's properties are ascribed to the person without collapsing natures.
 - Counters moralistic or works-based soteriology via insistence on Christ's **active and passive obedience** as necessary for both righteousness imputed and merit for fulfilling the covenant.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - A pragmatic taxonomy of union: **forensic union** (legal standing through federal representation) vs **vital union** (life and progressive sanctification by the Spirit).
 - Distinctive practical formulation of visible/invisible church that preserves discipline without denying invisible communion.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Though anonymously authored, the work has functioned as a digestible, seminex-style manual in Reformed seminary circles; frequently cited for its clear expositions on the five loci named above.
 - Adopted by pastors and catechists for clarity in preaching law and gospel and for teaching assurance grounded in union with Christ.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise pedagogical bridge between confessional scholasticism and pastoral theology: especially valuable for courses on soteriology, Christology, and ecclesiology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Visible Church**
 - The instituted, measurable congregation of believers and sacraments; locus of discipline and means of grace.
- **Invisible Church**
 - The elect in Christ known perfectly only to God; grounds assurance when related to union with Christ.
 - Tension: visible discipline aims to approximate invisible reality without equating the two.
- **Law-Gospel Distinction**
 - **Law**: reveals sin, restrains evil, guides believers (uses: civil, pedagogical).
 - **Gospel**: free offer of Christ's righteousness and grace; alone saves.
- **Spirit and Union with Christ**
 - Spirit is the agent effecting and certifying union; union is both forensic (status) and vital (life).
 - Union is the hermeneutical key for benefits (justification, adoption, sanctification).
- **Christ's Active Obedience**
 - Christ's full obedience to the law in life credited to believers for righteousness.
- **Christ's Passive Obedience**
 - Christ's suffering and death bearing penalty for sin; ground of pardon.
 - Both are necessary and complementary for justification.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum**
 - The interchange of properties between divine and human natures in the one person of Christ; safeguards both genuine human experience of suffering and genuine divine agency in redemption.
- **Justification**
 - Forensic declaration based on Christ's obedience and sacrifice received by faith.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive renewal by the Spirit within the union, distinct from but inseparable in experience from justification.
- **Covenant**
 - Federal framework: covenant of works (background), covenant of grace (Christ as mediator).
- **Means of Grace**
 - Word, sacrament, prayer: instruments by which Spirit applies union and its benefits.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded ultimately in Christ's obedience and Spirit-wrought union, not in subjective moral achievement.

- **Uses across loci**
 - Used as a **definition source** for Reformed formulations of active/passive obedience and communicatio idiomatum.
 - Employed as a **polemic and pastoral model**: calibrates law-gospel preaching, visible/invisible church practice, and assurance teaching.
