### TITLE
**God's Greater Glory: The Exalted God of Scripture and the Christian Faith** - Bruce A. Ware (Crossway, 2004). Evangelical Reformed, pastoral-systematic treatment emphasizing God-centered theology and doxology.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century evangelical-Reformed milieu; reaction to anthropocentric trends in theology, open theism, and pragmatic reductionism in church life.
 - Ware is a conservative evangelical systematician (Southern Baptist/evangelical circles) addressing academy and church simultaneously.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must be ordered to the **greater glory of God**: God is the highest good and ultimate end of all things; doctrine and devotion must be shaped to exalt the triune God.
 - Opposes views that domesticate God (reduce his transcendence, sovereignty, or worth) or that subordinate God to creaturely concerns.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Part I: Biblical-theological groundwork - Scripture portrays God as supremely glorious, sovereign, and worthy of worship.
 - Part II: Systematic integration - attributes of God (simplicity, immutability, omnipotence, omniscience, holiness, love, justice) presented in service of a doxological center.
 - Part III: Practical and pastoral outworkings - implications for worship, evangelism, sanctification, and the church's mission.
 - Major moves: exegetical demonstrations that Scripture intends God-centered worship; theological synthesis of classical attributes without reducing relational intimacy; pastoral application to contemporary church life.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Draws on classical and Reformed authorities (Augustine, Calvin), modern evangelical systematicians, and contemporary debates with open theism and Molinism.
 - Engages contemporary pastoral and academic critics who minimize transcendence or reframe divine sovereignty to accommodate libertarian freedom.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, attributes of God (aseity, simplicity, immutability, omnipotence/omniscience), Trinity, Christology (including **impeccability of Christ**), providence, salvation, worship and mission.
 - Explicit interest in how doctrinal loci cohere to magnify God.
- **Closing line**
 - Theological center of gravity: a doctrine of God that privileges **God's intrinsic glory** as the telos and criterion for right doctrine, worship, and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Sustained insistence that **glory-centered theology** must govern doctrinal method and pastoral praxis; not merely an attribute listing but an organizing telos.
 - Integration of classical theism with pastoral doxology-attributes explained primarily in light of God's worth and praise.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects anthropocentric tendencies: resists reducing God to a means for human flourishing or moral therapy.
 - Contrasts with open theism and certain Molinist accommodations that Ware sees as compromising divine sovereignty or reducing God's ultimate lordship.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not radical neologisms, but a consistent rhetorical and methodological reframing: evaluate doctrines by their capacity to magnify God's glory.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed/evangelical seminaries and conservative pastoral contexts as a concise defense of classical attributes oriented to worship.
 - Stimulated critique from defenders of libertarian freedom and Molinists; praised by those wanting a corrective to consumerist and pragmatic religion.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clear, doxologically-driven template for teaching doctrine of God; useful corrective where theology has become therapeutic or merely anthropological.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God's glory (doxa)** - Central telos; every doctrine is evaluated for its capacity to display and magnify God's worth.
- **Divine sovereignty** - Emphasized as intrinsic to God's glory; providence is the means by which God's purposes culminate in his praise.
- **Aseity** - God's self-existence tied to his inviolable worth and the ground of worship.
- **Simplicity & immutability** - Treated to safeguard unity of God's being and reliability for covenantal faithfulness.
- **Omnipotence / omniscience** - Interpreted not deus absconditus but as attributes that secure God's lordship and the reliability of his promises.
- **Trinitarian relations** - Glory is displayed within intra-Trinitarian life; relational language preserves both unity and distinction.
- **Christology & Impeccability of Christ** - Ware affirms Christ's **impeccability**: the incarnate Son did not and could not sin, a truth deployed to protect the holiness of redemption and the trustworthiness of mediation. Impeccability is presented as coherent with genuine human experience without positing peccability as possible in the incarnate person.
- **Providence** - God's governance ordered to his glory; providential ordering is not constrained by creaturely ultimacy.
- **Middle Knowledge / Molinism** - Ware is critical of frameworks that appeal to middle knowledge insofar as they relativize divine sovereignty by making God's will contingent on creaturely counterfactuals; he favors classical compatibilist accounts of providence that center God's lordship.
- **Holiness & love** - Held together: God's holy otherness does not cancel personal, redeeming love; both contribute to his worth.
- **Doxology (praxis)** - The practical payoff: worship, mission, and sanctification directed to magnifying God.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and concise synthesis for teaching the doctrine of God with a doxological orientation.
- As a **polemic** against open theism and Molinist moves that, according to Ware, undermine divine sovereignty.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading biblical texts through the criterion of God-centered praise and theological coherence.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in preaching and worship formation: doctrine not merely assent but orientation toward the glory of God.
