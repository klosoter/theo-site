### TITLE
Creation in Six Days - James B. Jordan

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed/Biblical-theological milieu; part of a pastoral-intellectual reaction to evolutionary and non-literal readings of Genesis.
 - Situated among conservative evangelical and Reformed interlocutors concerned with Scripture's historicity, Sabbath theology, and cultic/temple readings of the Pentateuch.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Genesis 1 reports a literal, historical six-day creation. The theological shape of the narrative (its literary and cultic features) reinforces, rather than negates, the historicity and theological significance of six consecutive 24-hour days.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Close literary and canonical reading of Genesis 1-2:
 - Emphasizes Hebrew vocabulary and narrative markers that signal ordinary day/night cycles.
 - Notes the canonical placement and function of Genesis relative to covenant and worship themes.
 - Cultic/temple motif:
 - Interprets creation week as divine priestly work culminating in Sabbath-as-sanctuary motif; the world is inaugurated as God's temple.
 - Polemic against competing models:
 - Counters day-age, framework, and concordist approaches on exegetical and theological grounds.
 - Theological consequences:
 - Links creation week to Sabbath law, covenant signs, human vocation (dominion, image-bearing), and eschatological hope.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages broadly with modern critical and conservative interpreters: proponents of framework hypothesis, day-age views, and evolutionary concordism.
 - Dialogues indirectly with traditions emphasizing priestly/temple readings of Genesis (e.g., those influenced by Klinean and other Reformed biblical-theological writers), while insisting on historical days.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Creation** (method and temporality)
 - **Revelation and Scripture** (hermeneutics and authority)
 - **Covenant** (creation as covenantal ordering)
 - **Sabbath and worship** (liturgical implications)
 - **Anthropology** (image of God, vocation)
 - **Eschatology** (creation as inaugurated kingdom)

- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity**
 - Genesis 1 is simultaneously a historical account of six ordinary days and a theological-cultic presentation of God establishing creation as his sanctified, covenantal temple, with the Sabbath as its sign and consummation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Marries literal historicity with a strong cultic/temple reading: the six-day pattern is both chronological and typological (week as liturgical microcosm).
 - Stresses the Sabbath not merely as ethical law but as covenantal sign tied integrally to the creational chronology.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Rejects purely literary or non-chronological readings (framework/day-age) that make the days a theological schema divorced from historical time.
 - Argues that cultic readings that deny historicity invert the text: cultic symbolism supports rather than replaces historical temporality.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines the language of "creation-as-temple" to insist the terminus of divine work (Sabbath) anchors the chronology; the week functions as both historical sequence and cultic pattern.
 - Develops "creational covenant" language stressing divine lordship enacted in six days.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among conservative Reformed and evangelical circles that prize canonical and liturgical readings of Scripture.
 - Used by pastors and teachers to defend a literal six-day creation while advancing richer liturgical-theological applications (Sabbath, worship formation).

- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Useful model for integrating exegetical precision with theological breadth: creation doctrine, Sabbath theology, and worship formation.
 - Provokes careful attention to how canonical and cultic motifs affect historical claims in the text.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Six-day creation**
 - The central claim: six ordinary, consecutive 24-hour days as the historical frame of Genesis 1.

- **Sabbath as covenant sign**
 - Sabbath functions as the creational covenant sign, not merely a later liturgical institution.

- **Creation-as-temple / cultic motif**
 - The cosmos is inaugurated as God's sanctuary; creation parallels the structure and function of the tabernacle/temple.

- **Historical-grammatical reading**
 - Insists on ordinary semantic force of Hebrew temporal markers unless compelling reason to do otherwise.

- **Anti-framework stance**
 - Opposes the framework hypothesis insofar as it treats the days as non-historical literary scaffolding divorced from chronology.

- **Anti-concordism**
 - Rejects attempts to harmonize Genesis 1 with modern evolutionary chronology; allows theological meaning without capitulating to scientific naturalism.

- **Creational covenant / covenantal ordering**
 - Creation is described in covenantal terms: God establishes order, assigns roles, and signs the covenant with Sabbath.

- **Priestly language / structure**
 - Notes priestly motifs (blessing, sanctifying, decreeing) embedded in the narrative, but reads them as complementary to historicity.

- **Image of God / human vocation**
 - Humans created in God's image to rule as covenantal vice-regents within the created temple-world.

- **Typology of week**
 - The seven-day pattern functions typologically, pointing forward to eschatological rest without negating its historical occurrence.

- **Canon-conscious exegesis**
 - Reads Genesis in light of its placement and function within the Pentateuch and broader canon.

- **Hermeneutical conservatism**
 - Upholds Scripture's plain sense and apostolic use as normative for doctrine and practice.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for conservative Reformed affirmation of six-day creation tied to Sabbath theology.
- As a **polemic** against framework, day-age, and concordist positions in pastoral and academic debates.
- As an **exegetical model** showing how canonical and cultic readings can reinforce, not supplant, historical claims.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching creational covenant, Sabbath formation, and the theological significance of chronology.
