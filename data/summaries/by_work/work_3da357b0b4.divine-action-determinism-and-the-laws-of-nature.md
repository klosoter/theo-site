### TITLE
Divine Action, Determinism, and the Laws of Nature - Jeffrey Koperski

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary analytic theology and philosophy of religion; engages late 20th-early 21st century debates about divine action, the metaphysics of laws, and the compatibility of providential governance with scientific explanation.
 - Situated amid interlocutors in philosophy of science (Humean vs non‑Humean law debates) and analytic theists concerned with divine causation and human freedom.

- **Central thesis**
 - Koperski advances a systematic account showing that a robust doctrine of divine action can be **reconciled** with determinism about natural processes when laws of nature are properly understood; divine governance need not be excluded by nomic regularities nor reduce to miraculous interruptions.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies distinct senses of determinism (metaphysical vs. nomic) and shows equivocation is common in theological debates.
 - Surveys competing accounts of laws of nature:
 - Humean regularity views (laws as descriptive summaries).
 - Non‑Humean/governing views (laws as ontologically robust, possibly grounded in God).
 - Develops a theistic account in which laws are connected to divine will or continual concurrence without collapsing creaturely causal efficacy.
 - Argues for a model of divine action compatible with scientific explanation:
 - God as sustaining ground or primary cause; creatures as genuine secondary causes within lawful processes.
 - Deterministic laws are not metaphysical barriers to divine causation but express regularities sustained by God.
 - Engages objections concerning freedom, miracle, and explanatory redundancy.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages with major figures in analytic philosophy of religion and science (e.g., Alvin Plantinga, Richard Swinburne, Nancy Cartwright, David Lewis via law metaphysics), and classical theistic themes from Augustine, Aquinas, and Reformed traditions implicitly through providence issues.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine action (concurrence, primary causation)
 - Providence and sustaining creation
 - The laws of nature (nomic ontology)
 - Human freedom and responsibility (compatibilist framing)
 - Miracles and non‑interventionist divine action

- **Closing line**
 - Koperski's theological center of gravity: **God's sovereign, sustaining action grounds lawful regularity rather than being precluded by it; determinism about natural processes is compatible with authentic divine causation and creaturely agency when laws are conceived theistically.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Persistent focus on definitional precision: separates kinds of determinism and senses of lawhood to avoid category errors in debates about divine action.
 - Emphasizes a middle path between miraculous interventionism and a deistic non‑interventionist God.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects simplistic portrayals of determinism as inherently atheistic or as negating providence.
 - Contrasts with reductionist Humean accounts that make laws purely epistemic; resists both Humean collapse and mystical occasionalism.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Deploys a theistic framing of "law‑grounding" (laws grounded in divine sustaining activity) without resorting to ad hoc miracles.
 - Advocates a refined notion of concurrence: God as ontological ground, creatures as causally efficacious within disciplined regularities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Modest but substantive influence in analytic theology and philosophy of religion circles; cited in discussions on theistic accounts of laws and divine action models that respect scientific methodology.
 - Used as a corrective reference against both theistic occasionalism and naturalistic eliminativism about divine agency.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful classroom resource for clarifying terms and mapping the conceptual terrain between metaphysics, philosophy of science, and theology.
 - Enduring as a bridge text-shows how classical doctrines of providence can be made intelligible in contemporary philosophy of science.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Determinism**
 - *Metaphysical determinism*: all facts fixed by prior state of world.
 - *Nomic (laws) determinism*: laws entail regular outcomes given antecedent conditions.

- **Laws of nature**
 - *Humean regularity*: laws = descriptive summaries of patterns.
 - *Non‑Humean / governing*: laws have ontic force; Koperski leans to a theistically grounded non‑reduction.

- **Divine action**
 - Encompasses concurrence, primary causation, sustaining creation without brute interventions.

- **Concurrence**
 - Model whereby God cooperates with creaturely causes such that both are truly causal; avoids causal redundancy.

- **Primary vs secondary causation**
 - *Primary*: God as ground of being and efficient cause.
 - *Secondary*: creatures as genuine causal agents operating under God's sustaining will.

- **Occasionalism**
 - Treated as a foil: problematic if it nullifies creaturely causation; Koperski resists this extreme.

- **Compatibilism (divine-human)**
 - Freedom framed compatibilistically: determinism and morally significant human agency can cohere within a theistic ontology.

- **Nomic grounding**
 - Idea that laws derive their authority from divine sustaining action rather than brute relations among events.

- **Interventionism vs non‑interventionism**
 - Distinguishes God's occasional miraculous interventions from God's persistent sustaining activity that underwrites lawful processes.

- **Modal grounding / explanation**
 - Uses grounding talk to explain modal features of laws (why laws obtain, what makes them necessary).

- **Explanation and scientific methodology**
 - Argues theological accounts of lawhood can be compatible with scientific explanation without epistemic overreach.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for theistic conceptions of laws of nature and divine concurrence.
- As a **polemic** against both naive interventionist theologies and naturalistic eliminativism about divine action.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in classes on providence, philosophy of science, and divine action where clarity about determinism and lawhood is required.
