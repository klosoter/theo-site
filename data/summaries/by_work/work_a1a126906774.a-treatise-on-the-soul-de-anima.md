### TITLE
A Treatise on the Soul (De Anima) - Tertullian (early 3rd century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Composed in the early 3rd century (c. 200-220), situated in the Latin, North African church of Carthage. Tertullian writes as a rigorously biblical apologist within an anti‑Platonic, anti‑Gnostic milieu; he aims to provide a Christian anthropology against Greco‑Roman philosophy and speculative Christian schools (notably Origenistic preexistence theories).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The soul is not an immaterial, independently immortal Platonic substance; it is psychophysically united to the body, has a material aspect, and its origin is bound up with human generation (traducianism). Natural immortality is denied; immortality is a gift of God realized in resurrection and judgment.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Scriptural exegesis: reads Genesis, Pauline passages, and Gospels to contest Platonic dualism and preexistence.
 - Philosophical refutation: challenges Plato, Stoic abstractions, and speculative metaphysics by appealing to empirical human procreation and biblical teaching.
 - Theological synthesis: argues that the soul derives from parental generation (explaining transmission of sin), is corporeal/animated matter (a "spiritus" of bodily kind), and survives only by divine will (conditional immortality).
 - Practical/pastoral moves: links anthropology to soteriology (original sin, culpability, resurrection).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Plato and Platonists, Stoics, Origen and speculative Christian teachers (preexistence), Roman medical/physiological ideas; heavy reliance on Scripture as corrective to philosophic claims.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (nature and origin of the soul), original sin and its transmission, immortality (natural vs. conditional), resurrection and judgment, polemics against preexistence and Platonic dualism.
- **Closing line capturing center of gravity:** Tertullian defends a biblical, embodied anthropology: the soul is a corporeal animating principle produced in human generation, not an independently immortal Platonic substance-immortality is bestowed by God and realized in resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong assertion of the **corporeality/animated materiality** of the soul (anima as not purely immaterial).
 - Clear advocacy of **traducianism**: soul transmitted in procreation, which supplies a theological account for the inheritance of sin.
 - Denial of **natural immortality**; immortality is a divine gift tied to eschatological resurrection.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Polemically opposes Platonic immaterialism and Origenistic preexistence, arguing that such notions undermine biblical teaching on creation, sin, and judgment.
 - Counters philosophical abstractions with a scripturally anchored, empirical account of human origin.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Advances Latin theological vocabulary for soul/spirit distinctions (anima, spiritus) and helps to shape Western theological frames for later debates about ensoulment and sin transmission.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Strong influence on later Western (Latin) tradition where traducian tendencies persisted; cited in patristic and medieval debates about ensoulment and original sin.
 - Frequently contrasted with Eastern Fathers and many medieval scholastics who favored creationism (each soul created directly by God).
 - Reappears in Reformation and post‑Reformation controversies; used variably by later thinkers as warrant for models of original sin and human nature.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - A paradigmatic early Christian anti‑Platonic anthropology and a compact exposition of why ensoulment and sin transmission matter doctrinally.
 - Useful as a primary source for understanding Latin patristic approaches to the soul, and as a polemical model for biblical theology countering philosophic abstraction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Anima:** life principle/soul; for Tertullian a bodily animating reality (not a purely immaterial substance).
- **Spiritus:** breath/spirit; often linked to bodily pneuma rather than an abstract immaterial spirit.
- **Corporeality of the soul:** the claim that soul has a material or bodily mode of existence/operation.
- **Traducianism (generatio per propagationem):** doctrine that souls are transmitted in human generation; used by Tertullian to explain original sin.
- **Creationism (creatio animae):** opposing view (each soul directly created by God); Tertullian argues against this in favor of traducianism.
- **Natural immortality vs. conditional immortality:** Tertullian denies inherent immortality of the soul; immortality is conditional upon God's gift and final resurrection.
- **Preexistence (praeexistentia):** speculative doctrine (Origen) that souls preexist bodies; Tertullian rejects it.
- **Original sin transmission:** theological problem answered by traducianism in Tertullian's scheme-parents pass on corrupt nature.
- **Psychophysical unity:** emphasis on soul‑body interdependence, not an ontological split.
- **Resurrection (resurrectio):** eschatological consummation; the arena in which immortality is ultimately realized.
- **Imago Dei:** human bearing of God's image discussed in light of embodied soul-rationality and moral responsibility without Platonic disembodiment.
- **Pneumatic/material language:** Tertullian blurs strict immaterial/material dichotomy, using pneumatic language to describe bodily functions.
- **Scriptural hermeneutic:** literal/anti‑speculative reading used to counter philosophical interpolations about the soul.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Western traducian anthropology and a primary witness against Platonic soul‑immaterialism.
- As a **polemic model** for biblical anti‑Platonic argumentation (useful in teaching patristic method).
- As an **exegetical touchstone** in debates about original sin, ensoulment, and conditional immortality; serves as a conceptual pivot in reception history.
