### TITLE
**Union with Christ: In Scripture, History, and Theology - Robert Letham**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 
 - Early 21st-century work arising within the contemporary Reformed-evangelical recovery of classical doctrine. Engages both confessional Reformed traditions and broader ecumenical historical theology. Aimed at pastors, students, and scholars seeking a comprehensive treatment of union theology across biblical, patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern loci.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** 
 - **Union with Christ is the central, integrative doctrine of soteriology**: it explains how believers are saved, justified, adopted, sanctified, receive sacramental benefit, and share eschatological life. Properly understood, union is personal, objective, and rooted in Christ's person (the hypostatic union).

- **Core argument or structure:** 
 - Careful exegesis of Pauline and Johannine texts that foreground participation (koinonia) and identification with Christ. 
 - Historical survey showing continuity and divergence from patristic, medieval, Reformation, and modern writers. 
 - Theological synthesis that situates union at the intersection of Christology, covenant theology, and sacramental theology. 
 - Practical implications for justification, sanctification, sacraments, and assurance.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Patristic authors (e.g., Athanasius, Augustine), Scholastics and medieval theologians, Reformers (especially Calvin), Reformed orthodox (e.g., Westminster tradition), and selected moderns (critical engagement with pietistic, liberal, and some evangelical accounts). Interaction with Christological categories (hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum) is constant.

- **Doctrines treated:** 
 - Christology (hypostatic union), soteriology (justification, adoption, sanctification), covenant theology (federal headship), sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesiology, eschatology, and the doctrine of revelation insofar as Scripture reveals union.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity):** 
 - Union with Christ is the doctrinal pivot that makes Christ's person efficacious for believers: through personal union believers truly share in Christ's life, death, resurrection, and benefits - a truth that must shape doctrine and devotion alike.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:** 
 - Strong insistence on the **personal and objective** character of union (not merely mystical feeling or ethical imitation). Union is grounded in Christ's person (hypostatic union) and realized objectively in the believer by the Spirit. 
 - Carefully balanced **Christological grounding**: uses classical Christology (including communicatio idiomatum) to secure how benefits are transmitted without ontological confusion.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:** 
 - Pushes back against reductionist evangelical accounts that treat union primarily as fellowship or moral influence. 
 - Corrects some scholastic or over-formal treatments that sever the experiential and sanctifying dimensions from the objective, forensic benefits.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:** 
 - Clarifies distinctions between **federal/headship union**, **personal union (to Christ)**, and **mystical participation**, while showing their interdependence. 
 - Uses Christological terminology rigorously to avoid equivocation when speaking of "participation" and "imputation."

- **Reception and influence:** 
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and by pastors for its sweep and pastoral clarity. Praised for rehabilitating historical resources; occasionally critiqued for limited engagement with Eastern Orthodox perspectives and certain newer doctrinal proposals.

- **Enduring value for study and teaching:** 
 - Serves as a comprehensive entry point to union theology that ties exegesis, history, and systematic reflection together; excellent for courses on soteriology, Christology, and sacramental theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ:** Central doctrine describing believers' participation in Christ's person and benefits.
- **Personal union (of believer to Christ):** The real, Spirit-wrought sharing in Christ's life, distinct from Christ's hypostatic union but grounded in it.
- **Hypostatic union:** Christological doctrine (divine and human natures united in one Person) used to ground how Christ's person can be the basis for believers' union.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Christological principle of attribute-communication; Letham appeals to it to show how properties of Christ's person make benefits communicable to believers (careful not to equate with deification).
- **Federal headship:** The covenantal/representative relationship by which Adam/Christ act as heads; explains legal imputation and corporate identity.
- **Imputation (forensic):** The accounting of Christ's righteousness to believers; shown to be inseparable from personal union for Letham.
- **Participation/koinonia:** New covenant participation in Christ's death and resurrection; emphasizes relational and experiential aspects.
- **Mystical union:** Letham distinguishes a historically loaded term but retains the reality of profound spiritual communion with Christ.
- **Sanctification:** The progressive transformation that flows from union; both positional and transformative in character.
- **Sacraments (baptism, Lord's Supper):** Means of grace by which union is sealed and signs that convey participation in Christ.
- **Adoption:** Status conferred through union and Spirit-wrought relation to the Father.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral consequence of union; grounded objectively in Christ more than subjective experience.
- **Eschatological consummation:** Union reaches fullness in resurrection and final glorification.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for union theology and for clarifying how Christology and soteriology interlock. 
- As a **polemic** against reductionist or purely forensic accounts of salvation that ignore participation and sanctification. 
- As an **exegetical model** for Pauline texts on participation (e.g., Romans, Galatians) and for sacramental theology that links sign and reality.
