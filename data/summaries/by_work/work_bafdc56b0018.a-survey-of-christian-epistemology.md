### TITLE
A Survey of Christian Epistemology - Cornelius Van Til

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-20th century Reformed scholar writing from Westminster Theological Seminary amid postwar theological realignments, analytic philosophy, and rising challenges from theological liberalism, empiricism, and positivism.
 - Developed within the Dutch-Reformed tradition (Kuyper, Bavinck) but in polemical encounter with modern and contemporary figures (Kant, Hume, Locke, Descartes, pragmatists, logical positivists) and intra-Reformed interlocutors (notably Gordon Clark, Karl Barth).
- **Central thesis**
 - Christian theism (the self-revealing triune God) must be the universal and explicit presupposition of all intelligible knowledge; unbelieving systems are ultimately self-contradictory because they exclude the necessary preconditions for rationality, morality, and empirical order.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Epistemology is inherently theological: knowledge presupposes the Creator-creature distinction and God's sustaining of creaturely order.
 - Human cognition is affected by sin (total depravity in cognition), so non-Christian thought cannot claim neutral, autonomous reason.
 - Scriptural revelation is the **ultimate epistemic norm**; Scripture is self-attesting as God's propositional revelation, supplying the ultimate axiom for thought.
 - Transcendental critique: show that the non-Christian worldview cannot account for the laws of logic, uniformity of nature, or moral obligations without borrowing from Christian theism.
 - Practical apologetics: indict the unbeliever's presuppositions, demonstrate inconsistency, then present Christianity as the coherent foundation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Abraham Kuyper, Herman Bavinck for theistic presuppositions; engages Kant, Hume, Locke, Descartes, neopositivists, pragmatists; polemically interacts with Karl Barth (on revelation, general revelation) and Gordon Clark (on the role of propositions and axioms).
 - Influenced and propagated by later figures in the Van Tillian school (Greg Bahnsen, John Frame).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (special and general), Providence, Trinity (as grounding of rationality), Creation (including sustaining action), Sin (epistemic dimensions of depravity), Covenant (as relational context for knowledge), Theodicy and divine justice (implications for intelligibility of evil).
- **Closing line**
 - Van Til's center of gravity: **theology (God's self-disclosure) is epistemology** - only a theistic, covenantal frame genuinely secures rationality, morality, and intelligible experience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the non-neutrality of human thought: there is no "neutral ground" between Christian and non-Christian worldviews.
 - Use of a transcendental or preconditioned argument showing Christianity as necessary for the possibility of rationality and experience.
 - Integration of covenantal categories into epistemology: knowledge is relational and rooted in God's covenantal revelation, not merely propositional assent.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Rejects classical evidentialism/natural theology that seeks neutral proofs and common ground; argues they illegitimately presuppose Christian concepts they deny.
 - Differs from Gordon Clark by emphasizing the living God (revelation and covenant) rather than merely logical axioms; differs from Barth by maintaining a robust role for general revelation and apologetic engagement.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Antithesis" as an epistemic and moral chasm between Christian and non-Christian thought.
 - Application of a transcendental critique to demonstrate the incoherence of autonomous worldviews.
 - Emphasis on Scripture as the self-attesting epistemic axiom.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundational for presuppositional apologetics; shaped Reformed seminaries and apologetical practice (Bahnsen, Frame).
 - Contested by proponents of classical apologetics, evidentialism, and some analytic philosophers; inspired sustained debate on neutrality, warrant, and the nature of religious epistemology.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies how doctrine of God constrains epistemology; sharp tool for theological critique of secular philosophies; indispensable for courses linking systematic theology, apologetics, and philosophy of religion.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presuppositionalism** - epistemic method that begins with theological presuppositions rather than neutral evidences.
- **Antithesis** - the fundamental, pervasive opposition between Christian and non-Christian frameworks.
- **Transcendental argument (TAG)** - demonstration that certain features (logic, morality, uniformity) presuppose the Christian God.
- **Self-attesting Scripture** - claim that Scripture, by virtue of divine authorship, is its own ultimate warrant.
- **Creator-creature distinction** - ontological ground for humility about human reason and for God's sovereign epistemic priority.
- **Total depravity (epistemic)** - doctrine that sin corrupts cognitive faculties and therefore undermines claims to autonomous rationality.
- **Covenantal epistemology** - knowledge as embedded in covenantal relation to God rather than mere propositional assent.
- **Common grace** - explains the possibility of true knowledge and cultural achievements outside explicit faith, yet remains subordinate to special revelation.
- **Sustaining action / Logos** - God's ongoing upholding of creation as the basis for the uniformity of nature and intelligibility.
- **Self-contradiction indict** - rhetorical/apologetic move showing internal inconsistency in unbelieving thought.
- **Revelation-as-axiom** - theistic revelation functions as the first principle in reasoning.
- **Epistemic antithesis vs. apologetic engagement** - the distinction between the theoretical divide and the everyday missionary/apologetic task of testimony and persuasion.
- **Contrast with Reformed epistemology** - Van Til insists on explicit presuppositions and transcendental demonstration rather than merely proper basicality of belief.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for Christian epistemology and apologetics - supplies terminological and methodological anchors.
 - As a **polemic** against evidentialist, naturalistic, and some neo-orthodox epistemologies - used in apologetic textbooks and debates.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking systematic doctrines (God, revelation, sin, covenant) to practical apologetics and philosophy of religion.
