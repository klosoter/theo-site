### TITLE
**God Dwells Among Us: Expanding Eden to the Ends of the Earth** - Gregory K. Beale with Mitchell Kim (2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Published 2014 within contemporary Reformed-evangelical biblical theology; follows Beale's canonical and typological method developed in The Temple and the Church's Mission and The Book of Revelation.
 - Engages current debates on Genesis interpretation, temple imagery, and missional theology amid late‑modern cultural and scientific questions.

- **Central thesis**
 - God's intention is to re‑establish his dwelling among humans by expanding the Eden/temple pattern outward through redemptive history: Eden → tabernacle/temple → Christ (true temple) → church empowered by Spirit to extend God's presence to the ends of the earth.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey of Eden and temple motifs in the Old Testament as complementary patterns of God's presence and human vocation.
 - Typological-canonical reading showing how Christ fulfills and reconstitutes Eden/temple realities (incarnational and priest-king roles).
 - Pneumatological and ecclesiological implication: Spirit indwelling creates a corporate, missional people who enact the cultural mandate.
 - Practical missiology: cultural transformation framed as expanding God's dwelling, not merely social reform.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Dialogue with canonical/biblical-theological voices (e.g., commentators on temple theology), and interaction with contemporary interpreters of Genesis (implicit engagement with approaches like John Walton's functional view and with traditional historicist readings).
 - Draws on Septuagintal and New Testament exegesis to trace typology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (OT-NT continuity), covenant, Trinity (implicit and explicit readings of God's presence), Christology (Christ as true temple/king), pneumatology (Spirit as indwelling presence), creation/new creation, image of God, vocation/dominion.

- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: the Bible narrates God's persistent initiative to dwell with his image‑bearing people, accomplished in Christ and advanced by the Spirit through the church's vocation to renew creation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reframes the cultural mandate and mission in terms of *dwelling presence*: mission is not only sending institutions but expanding God's habitation across the created order.
 - Strong canonical-typological continuity: Eden and temple are two aspects of one divine plan rather than separate motifs.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Pushes back on readings that isolate Eden as purely primordial or purely symbolic; insists on historical‑theological continuity into the NT.
 - Nuances interactions with John Walton-style functional readings: emphasizes theological-historical claims about God's presence and human vocation even while recognizing genre concerns.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - The phrase and programmatic concept of **"expanding Eden"** as a theological framework linking temple imagery, Christ's ministry, and church mission.
 - Treats **dominion/vocation** primarily as participation in God's habitation project rather than merely anthropocentric control.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical circles for preaching, mission theology, and curriculum on biblical theology.
 - Cited as a robust model for relating creation theology to mission and church identity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers an integrated exegetical model connecting Genesis-Revelation that is pedagogically useful and practically oriented toward mission and culture.
 - Serves as a corrective to both secularized cultural mandates and pietistic withdrawal from cultural engagement.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Image of God**
 - Understood as relational and representative: humans mirror God by hosting his presence and exercising delegated rule; central to vocation and dignity.

- **Vocation / Dominion / Cultural Mandate**
 - Recast as stewardship aimed at expanding God's dwelling; cultural work is service of making space for God's presence, not mere anthropocentric mastery.

- **Eden-Temple Typology**
 - Eden and the temple are homologous institutions: both are sacred spaces where God dwells with humans; typology traces fulfillment in Christ and the church.

- **God's Presence / Divine Dwelling**
 - The focal category: presence is covenantal, incarnational (Christ), and pneumatological (Spirit indwelling the church).

- **Christ as True Temple and King**
 - Christ embodies and perfects temple functions (priests, sacrifices, throne) and inaugurates the expansion of God's dwelling through resurrection and ascension.

- **Trinity - OT and NT Revelation**
 - Argues for continuity: OT temple language hints at a plurality in God's presence; NT reveals Father, Son, Spirit as participants in the dwelling, mission, and new creation.

- **New Creation / Restoration**
 - Redemptive telos: restoration of Eden's order extended to the cosmos under Christ's reign.

- **Canonical reading**
 - Methodological stance: Scripture must be read as unified narrative; typology and canonical connections govern interpretation.

- **Science & Scripture (Genesis 1-11)**
 - Treats Genesis 1-11 as the theological‑historical foundation for creation, fall, and promise; interacts with scientific questions but prioritizes redemptive‑historical and theological claims over settling technical scientific chronologies.

- **Pneumatology - Indwelling People**
 - The Spirit unites Christ and church, enabling corporate habitation and mission.

- **Mission as Expansion of Presence**
 - Mission theology reframed from outreach activities to creating loci of divine habitation in culture.

How this work is used across loci:
- Definition source for *Image of God* emphasizing representational/vocational aspects.
- Polemic against readings that separate creation theology from mission or reduce Genesis to non‑historical myth.
- Exegetical model for canonical/typological reading linking Eden, temple, Christ, and church.
- Conceptual pivot in mission theology: frames cultural engagement as enabling God's dwelling among people.
