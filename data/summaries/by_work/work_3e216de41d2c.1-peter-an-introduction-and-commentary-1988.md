### TITLE
**1 Peter: An Introduction and Commentary (1988)** - Wayne Grudem, Tyndale New Testament Commentaries (IVP)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late-20th-century evangelical exegesis; concise, pastorally oriented TNTC volume.
 - Grammatical-historical method with theological synthesis; influenced by Reformed-evangelical commitments and continuationist convictions about gifts.
 - Addresses Petrine churches in Asia Minor under social marginalization; reads them as metaphorical exiles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - God forms a holy, hopeful people through redemptive suffering; their identity in the risen Christ empowers sanctified conduct and witness in a hostile world.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - 1:1-12: Identity and hope - election, new birth, living hope, eschatological inheritance.
 - 1:13-2:10: Sanctification - be holy; new-covenant priesthood; Scripture-formed identity.
 - 2:11-3:12: Exilic conduct - submission for the Lord's sake within civic, household, and marital spheres; apologetic gentleness.
 - 3:13-4:11: Suffering and speech - Christ's atoning pattern (3:18), spirits in prison; sober-minded prayer; use of gifts (4:10-11) for God's glory.
 - Spiritual gifts clustered as speaking and serving; stewardship of grace for communal edification.
 - 4:12-5:11: Fiery trials and shepherding - rejoice in suffering; humility; vigilance against the devil; promise of restoration.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages standard Petrine scholarship (e.g., Kelly, Beare, Selwyn) and lexical/grammatical resources.
 - Distinctive interaction with 1 Pet 3:18-22 debates; draws on wider NT theology of gifts and Spirit.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation/Scripture, election and new birth, sanctification and suffering, atonement and exemplar, ecclesiology (priesthood, elders), pneumatology and spiritual gifts, anthropology (soul/spirit language; dichotomy vs trichotomy), eschatology (hope and judgment).
- **Closing line**
 - The epistle's center of gravity: a pilgrim church whose Spirit-empowered holiness and love, practiced through humble submission and exercised gifts, glorifies God amid suffering until final salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Classifies gifts in 4:10-11 as two functional groupings: **speaking** and **serving**, both dependent on divine supply, aimed at God's glory through Jesus Christ.
 - Reads 3:18 "made alive in the spirit" as mode/sphere of resurrection life, not evidence for a tripartite human constitution; cautions against trichotomist proof-texting.
 - Interprets "spirits in prison" in continuity with his broader view: Christ, by the Spirit, preaching through Noah to his contemporaries; rejects a postmortem evangelism or a literal descent to preach.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back on triumphalist or culture-war readings; the church's witness is cruciform, exilic, and hospitable.
 - Challenges trichotomy by arguing NT uses of psyche and pneuma overlap; 1 Peter's vocabulary is situational, not ontologically partitioned.
 - Warns against sensationalism in gifts; stresses sober-minded prayer and love as the matrix of charismatic ministry.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - "Stewardship of grace" frames charismata as entrusted resources for others, not personal status.
 - Functional binning of gifts (speaking/serving) becomes a pedagogical handle for local-church practice.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in evangelical circles for 1 Pet 3:18-22 and 4:10-11; oft-cited in debates on spiritual gifts continuation and on anthropology.
 - Serves as a lean, accessible counterpoint to heavier technical commentaries; shaped teaching on elder shepherding and suffering.
- **Enduring value**
 - A crisp exegetical map for preaching and catechesis; reliable on sanctification-through-suffering and on the ethics of exile.
 - Useful touchstone in systematic loci: pneumatology (gifts), soteriology (atonement and perseverance), anthropology (dichotomy).

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Elect exiles (1:1)**: Covenantal identity in dispersion; grounds holiness and hope.
- **New birth (anagennao, 1:3,23)**: Divine initiative producing living hope and obedience.
- **Living hope**: Eschatological orientation that sustains present endurance.
- **Holiness as identity and vocation**: Be what you are in Christ; conduct as public witness.
- **Submission for the Lord's sake**: Civic/household patterns that adorn the gospel amid marginalization.
- **Christ's atoning suffering (3:18)**: Substitutionary, once-for-all, exemplar for patient endurance.
- **Made alive in the spirit (3:18)**:
 - Sphere of resurrection life, not the human spirit over against body; resists trichotomy claims.
- **Spirits in prison (3:19)**:
 - Interpreted as Noah's generation addressed by the pre-incarnate Christ through the Spirit; no postmortem evangel.
- **Hidden person of the heart (3:4)**:
 - Inner life language that does not necessitate tripartite ontology; adornment of character.
- **Soul/spirit language (psyche/pneuma)**:
 - Contextual and overlapping usage; favors **dichotomy** (material and immaterial) over **trichotomy**.
- **Charismata (4:10)**:
 - Gifts as diverse expressions of God's multiform grace entrusted to the church.
- **Stewards of God's varied grace (oikonomoi, 4:10)**:
 - Gifts as fiduciary trusts; accountability and other-oriented service.
- **Speaking and serving gifts (4:11)**:
 - Two functional categories; speech must carry God's oracles; service must rely on God's strength.
- **Sober-minded prayer and love (4:7-8)**:
 - The spiritual atmosphere of sanctified gifting; love covers sins, protecting community health.
- **Elders as shepherds (5:1-4)**:
 - Exemplary, non-domineering care; hope fixed on the Chief Shepherd.

- **How this work is used**
 - As an exegetical model for sanctification under suffering and the ethics of exile.
 - As a concise, continuationist-friendly account of spiritual gifts' purpose and practice (4:10-11).
 - As a polemical and exegetical resource favoring **dichotomy** over **trichotomy** in anthropological debates.
 - As a preaching guide to frame atonement, hope, and communal stewardship of grace.
