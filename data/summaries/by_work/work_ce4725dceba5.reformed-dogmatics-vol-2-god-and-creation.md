### TITLE
**Reformed Dogmatics, Vol. 2: God and Creation (Herman Bavinck)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Late 19th-early 20th c. Dutch Neo-Calvinism; retrieval of Reformed Orthodoxy amid modern theology (Kant, Hegel, Schleiermacher) and emerging sciences. Bavinck writes as a churchly scholar integrating classical theism with cultural and scientific developments.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To articulate the doctrine of the triune God and his works ad extra (decree, creation, providence) in a way that secures the Creator-creature distinction, upholds classical attributes, and positively situates creation, culture, and science under God's providence and covenantal purposes.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Knowledge of God: incomprehensibility, names, and the analogical mode of theology; rejection of both rationalism and agnosticism.
 - Divine being and attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability, omnipresence, omniscience, omnipotence, holiness, love; communicable/incommunicable distinction refined.
 - Trinity: biblical revelation, consubstantiality, personal properties, eternal generation and spiration, missions and appropriations; opera ad extra indivisa.
 - Divine decree: one, simple, comprehensive, wise; predestination; concurrence with second causes without fatalism.
 - Creation: ex nihilo, goodness, teleology; humanity as image of God; Sabbath and cultural mandate; angels and demons.
 - Providence: preservation, concurrence, government; miracle and law; permission of sin without God as author.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors:** Scripture and ecumenical creeds; Augustine, Aquinas, Lombard, Reformed orthodox (Calvin, Turretin, Mastricht); Kuyper and Dutch tradition; in debate with Schleiermacher, Ritschl, Kantian/Hegelian idealism, pantheism (Spinoza), deism, materialism, evolutionisms.
- **Doctrines treated:** Theology proper, Trinity, decree, creation, providence, angelology, anthropology (imago Dei, covenantal order), general revelation and natural theology (as related to creation).
- **Closing line:** The living, simple, triune God freely creates and governs all things toward their sabbath consummation, and in this theater of glory humanity images God for worshipful culture under his covenant.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - **Organic motif:** revelation, church, and creation form an organism; truth is catholic and coherent.
 - **Full classical theism with vitality:** simplicity and immutability affirmed without rendering God inert; rich account of divine life and love.
 - **Imago Dei (broad/narrow):** structural capacities remain postfall; ethical likeness (true knowledge, righteousness, holiness) lost and restored in Christ.
 - **Trinitarian grammar:** strong use of missions/appropriations; ad extra indivisa alongside fitting appropriations.
 - **Providence and science:** concursus underwrites creaturely integrity; miracles are not violations but higher acts of the same sovereign God.
- **Corrections or contrasts:**
 - Against **pantheism/deism:** preserves transcendence and immanence; rejects absorption of God into world or God's withdrawal.
 - Against **liberal revisions:** maintains impassibility and immutability while distinguishing divine affections ad extra.
 - Against **Roman donum superadditum:** original righteousness belongs to creation's integrity, not an external add-on.
 - Nuances **evolutionary claims:** welcomes empirical findings within Christian teleology; rejects metaphysical naturalism.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - **Archetypal/ectypal theology** applied to creation and Trinity.
 - **Principium language:** principium essendi in God; principium cognoscendi in revelation.
 - Refined use of **communicable/incommunicable** attributes and **appropriation**.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in Reformed dogmatics; formative for Dutch Reformed, neo-Calvinist, and evangelical retrievals of classical theism; influential on Vos, Van Til, Torrance (selectively), and contemporary doctrine of God debates.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplary synthesis of confessional fidelity, historical theology, and cultural engagement; a stable reference for attributes, Trinity, imago, providence, and the Creator-creature distinction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Incomprehensibility/Knowability of God:** God is truly known, never comprehended; grounds analogical predication.
- **Analogy (archetypal/ectypal):** God's self-knowledge archetypal; our theology ectypal by revelation; guards mystery and truth.
- **Simplicity:** God is not composed of parts; attributes are identical with God's essence, distinguished by our finite conception.
- **Aseity and Independence:** God's fullness of life in and of himself; creation adds nothing to his being.
- **Immutability/Impassibility (rightly qualified):** No change in being, purpose, or blessedness; affections are covenantal revelations, not passions of need.
- **Communicable/Incommunicable Attributes:** Pedagogical distinction Bavinck refines to avoid separation in God.
- **Trinity: Processions and Missions:** Eternal generation and spiration ground temporal missions; opera ad extra indivisa with fitting appropriations.
- **Divine Decree:** Single, wise, all-encompassing; includes predestination; secures certainty while establishing secondary causes.
- **Concursus:** God's concurrent action with creaturely causes; basis for lawlike regularity and human responsibility.
- **Creation ex nihilo:** Free, teleological act; affirms goodness, order, and ultimate Sabbath goal.
- **Providence (preservation, concurrence, government):** Continuous divine care; makes room for miracle without contravening truth.
- **Imago Dei (broad/narrow):** Structural (broad) image remains; ethical (narrow) likeness lost in fall and restored in Christ.
- **Cultural Mandate/Sabbath:** Humanity called to unfold creation toward God-glorifying rest.
- **Miracle:** Intensified, extraordinary acts of the same sovereign God; signs within, not against, creation's order.
- **Common Grace (implied within providence):** Explains cultural goods and restraint of sin without saving effect.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for divine attributes, Trinity, decree, and providence.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for imago Dei, cultural mandate, and science-theology relations.
 - As a **polemical resource** against pantheism, deism, materialism, and liberal revisions of classical theism.
 - As a **synthetic model** integrating general revelation, anthropology, and Christological fulfillment of creation.
