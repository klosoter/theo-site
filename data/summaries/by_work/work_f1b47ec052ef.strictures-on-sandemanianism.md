### TITLE
**Strictures on Sandemanianism - Andrew Fuller**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late 18th-century evangelical and Particular Baptist milieu amid the wider Sandemanian controversy (the debate generated by Robert Sandeman and the Glasite tradition).
 - Context: reaction against perceived antinomian and reductionist accounts of faith that circulated among some Scottish and English sects; rise of practical evangelical piety and missionary impulse in Fuller's circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Sandemanianism reduces saving faith to bare intellectual assent; Fuller argues this both misconstrues biblical faith and undermines the covenant of grace by severing faith from trust, affection, and moral fruit.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Diagnose Sandemanian claim: faith = mere belief/assertion of facts about Christ.
 - Exegetical refutation: Scripture portrays faith as trust/reliance (with concomitant affection and obedience), not mere assent.
 - Doctrinal correction: affirm justification by faith alone while insisting that genuine faith necessarily produces good works as its fruit and evidence.
 - Pastoral and covenantal move: show practical consequences - assurance, church discipline, and sanctification - that require a richer account of faith.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal target: Robert Sandeman and his followers (Sandemanians/Glasites).
 - Fuller draws on Scripture, patristic and Reformed resources, Baptist confessional commitments, and pastoral observations.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Nature of faith (assent vs. trust)
 - Justification and assurance
 - Sanctification and good works
 - Covenant of grace and the role of works within it
 - Means and evidences of grace
- **Closing line**
 - Fuller situates true evangelical faith as trusting reliance that secures justification while inevitably producing moral fruits - thereby preserving the free meritlessness of salvation and the indispensable evidences of grace.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Insistence that faith is relational trust (fiduciary reliance) with affective and volitional dimensions, not merely cognitive assent.
 - Balanced insistence on free justification together with the necessary evidential role of good works.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Corrects Sandemanian minimalism that divorces faith from trust and obedience.
 - Also opposes soft antinomian tendencies among some hyper-Calvinists by insisting on sanctification as characteristic of covenant membership.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Clear distinction between the formal aspect of faith (knowledge of facts) and its instrumental/relational aspect (trust in Christ), with priority given to the latter for soteriology and pastoral practice.
 - Clarifies the juridical vs. moral uses of works in the covenant of grace: not meritorious for salvation, but constitutive as evidence and fruit.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among Baptists and evangelicals as a corrective to antinomianism and sterile intellectualism in religion.
 - Influenced 19th-century Baptist piety, pastoral theology, and the emerging missionary movement with its practical emphasis on holiness.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a model of pastoral polemic that is scripturally rooted, theologically nuanced, and pastorally sensitive.
 - Useful for contemporary debates on faith/assent, assurance, and the relation of justification to sanctification.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Sandemanianism**
 - The view (from Robert Sandeman) that saving faith is mere intellectual assent to gospel facts; Fuller critiques its implications.
- **Bare faith / Assent**
 - Cognitive acknowledgement of gospel truth; treated as insufficient for saving faith in Fuller's account.
- **Saving faith**
 - For Fuller: trustful reliance on Christ, involving heart and will, not just belief of propositions.
- **Trust (fiducia)**
 - Central term Fuller uses to capture the relational, trusting dimension of true faith.
- **Good works**
 - Effects/fruits and evidences of saving faith; necessary for assurance but not meritorious for justification.
- **Merit**
 - Explicitly denied as the ground of salvation in the covenant of grace; Fuller insists works are not wages but fruits and confirmations.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Fuller's theological framework: secures free justification while prescribing holiness as the covenantal goal; works function as covenantal evidence, not price.
- **Justification by faith**
 - Affirmed robustly; Fuller maintains imputed righteousness alone secures legal acceptance while faith's relational nature is decisive for applying that benefit.
- **Sanctification**
 - Progressive renewal; treated as the expected necessary consequence of true faith.
- **Assurance**
 - Grounded in Christ and the promises, confirmed by the inward and outward evidences (including good works).
- **Evidences of grace**
 - Inner affections, prayer, and outward obedience jointly provide assurance of saving faith.
- **Means of grace**
 - Fuller defends Scripture, preaching, sacraments, and prayer as ordinary instruments that produce and confirm faith and its fruits.
- **Faith and repentance relation**
 - Distinct but inseparable: repentance accompanies and evidences saving faith in the covenantal order.
- **Moral evidence**
 - Fuller's phrase for the observable ethical fruits that corroborate a profession of faith.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **polemic** against antinomian and reductionist accounts of faith.
 - As an **exegetical model** for arguing that biblical faith is trust-oriented.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in Baptist and evangelical treatments of the covenant of grace, justification, and assurance.
