### TITLE
Friedrich Schleiermacher: Between Enlightenment and Romanticism (ed. Mariña)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 19th century Germany; intellectual horizon shaped by Kantian critical philosophy, German Romanticism, Pietist devotional currents, and post-Enlightenment religio-cultural negotiation.
 - Schleiermacher as mediator: trained in Reformed/Lutheran theology, professor in Berlin; contemporaneous interlocutors include Kant, Fichte, Novalis, and Schleiermacher's Pietist forebears.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theology must ground itself not in speculative metaphysics or detached rational proofs, but in the **basic religious consciousness** - the "feeling of absolute dependence" - from which doctrine, ecclesial life, and ethics flow.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Religion is a distinct form of human knowledge centered on immediate, pre-reflective feeling; dogma and Scripture are secondary articulations that aim to make that feeling intelligible and communal.
 - Revelation:
 - General revelation: nature, conscience, and cultural-religious expression manifest the religious capacity of humanity.
 - Special revelation: Christ is the paradigmatic, historically attested instance of God-consciousness, enabling communal appropriation.
 - Soteriology and sin: sin is primarily an existential alienation from the religious self and communion; salvation is restoration through Christ-shaped religious formation and ecclesial mediation.
 - Eschatology: consummation conceived as the full realization of religious community and moral-cultural transformation (newness rooted in transformed consciousness).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Kant (critical limits of natural theology), Fichte (subjectivity and self-consciousness), Romantic poets (emphasis on individual feeling and organic wholeness), orthodox Lutheran and Reformed traditions (doctrine, sacramentality).
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (general vs. special), theology proper (God as object of absolute dependence), Christology (Jesus as archetype of religious consciousness), soteriology (regeneration as formation), doctrine of sin (guilt, alienation), eschatology (new creation as communal transformation), limited engagements with covenantal language and analogia entis/fidei debates.
- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher reorients Christian theology from metaphysical-propositional certainties to a hermeneutic of religious experience: theology as disciplined articulation of the community's felt relation to the Absolute.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of religious feeling over propositional creed; theology as descriptive and constructive of communal experience.
 - Integration of Romantic aesthetics into theological method - beauty and Bildung (formation) as theological concepts.
- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Against Enlightenment rationalist proofs: rejects natural theology as sufficient ground for faith.
 - Against metaphysical scholasticism (and analogia entis): resists constructing God in metaphysical likeness to creatures; prefers knowing God through religious self-awareness and Christ-event.
 - Against rigid voluntarist or deterministic systems: emphasizes moral and spiritual development in freedom.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - "Feeling of absolute dependence" as foundational category.
 - Recasting revelation in experiential and communicative terms (Scripture and sacrament as communal forms of appropriation rather than infallible propositional repositories).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Enormous influence on liberal Protestantism, modern historical-critical theology, and theology of religion; provoked reaction:
 - Embraced by theological liberals for subjectivizing faith and historical study.
 - Rejected or revised by Barthian neo-orthodoxy emphasizing objective revelation and divine initiative.
- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the hermeneutical and existential dimensions of doctrine; indispensable for studying modern shifts in epistemology, ecclesial identity, and the role of feeling/aesthetics in theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - foundational, pre-conceptual religious awareness; source for theological reflection.
- **Religious consciousness** - the structure of self-awareness in relation to the Absolute; central analytic category.
- **General vs. Special Revelation** - general in nature/conscience; special realized definitively in Christ and ecclesial confession.
- **Christ as paradigmatic consciousness** - Jesus as exemplar and normative model for religious selfhood, rather than merely metaphysical God-man schema.
- **Revelation as communication** - Scripture and sacrament function as forms in which the church recognizes and shapes religious feeling.
- **Sin as alienation** - emphasis on relational estrangement and moral formation rather than forensic categories alone.
- **Soteriology as formation (Bildung)** - salvation conceived as transformation of sensibility, judgment, and communal life.
- **Analogia entis / analogia fidei** - Schleiermacher tilts away from ontological analogies toward communicative, existential analogies grounded in religious life.
- **Covenant language** - utilized historically and ethically rather than as legalistic metaphysical framework; covenantal motifs serve pedagogical/communal purposes.
- **Eschatology (new heavens and new earth)** - read imaginatively as the consummation of communal religious maturation and moral-cultural renewal.
- **Authority of Scripture** - authoritative as the church's formative text, not as an inaccessible metaphysical guarantee; interpretive and historical-critical approaches legitimate.
- **Theology as critique + construction** - critical of metaphysical pretensions, constructive for ecclesial practice.
- **Freedom and responsibility** - human freedom emphasized in moral and spiritual development against deterministic schemas.
- **Aesthetic and ethical integration** - beauty and Bildung as mediums of theological formation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for modern conceptions of revelation and religious consciousness.
 - As a **polemic** against natural theology and scholastic analogies (useful in debates over analogia entis).
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings that prioritize the experiential and communal functions of Scripture and sacrament.
