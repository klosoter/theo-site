### TITLE
A. A. Hodge, "The Confession of Faith: A Handbook of Christian Doctrine" (exposition of the Westminster Standards)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid‑ to late‑19th century American Reformed/Presbyterian milieu (Princeton school). Written as a popular yet doctrinally rigorous exposition of the Westminster Confession and Catechisms for pastors, students, and laity amid challenges from revivalism, Arminianism, Unitarianism, and emerging theological liberalism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To expound, defend, and apply the Westminster Confession as the coherent, biblical expression of historic Reformed orthodoxy, showing its sufficiency for worship, doctrine, and church order in exigent modern contexts.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Systematic walk through the Confession's loci:
 - Scripture and revelation (authority and infallibility of Scripture).
 - God (Trinity, attributes, decrees, providence).
 - Creation, fall, and sin (original corruption, federal headship).
 - Christ (two natures, offices: Prophet, Priest, King; atonement).
 - Redemption (election, effectual calling, justification, adoption).
 - Sanctification and means of grace (Word, sacraments, prayer).
 - Church, sacraments, civil magistrate, and eschatology.
 - Method: exegetical support for Confessional articles, theological synthesis, pastoral application.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Westminster Divines, Reformed scholastics, Calvin.
 - Opponents/contrasts: Arminian theology, Pelagian tendencies, Roman Catholic scholasticism, Unitarian and rationalist critics, revivalist abuses.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture, Trinity, providence, creation, fall, original sin, law and gospel, election, atonement, justification, adoption, sanctification, sacraments (infant baptism, Lord's Supper), church polity, eschatology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Hodge places the **sovereignty of God** and the **sufficiency of Scripture** at the center: the Confession is both the doctrinal map and pastoral instrument for a covenantal, Christ‑centred Reformed faith.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Confessional fidelity married to pastoral clarity**
 - Hodge neither merely repeats formulas nor offers speculative additions; he reads the Confession as a practical theological handbook for ministry and catechesis.
- **Balance of scholastic precision and pastoral tone**
 - Uses technical Reformed categories (federal headship, covenant of works/grace, penal substitution) with clear pastoral implications-assurance, sanctification, means of grace.
- **Firm affirmation of penal substitution and imputation**
 - Clear rejection of moral‑influence and governmental theories of atonement; insists on objective penal satisfaction and forensic imputation in justification.
- **Covenant theology as organizing principle**
 - Systematic use of covenantal categories to connect Adam/Christ, law/evangel, sacramental signs and seals, and the continuity of God's saving purposes.
- **Correctives and contrasts**
 - Corrects semi‑Pelagian or Baxterian tendencies by reasserting sovereign election and effectual calling.
 - Opposes rationalist and Unitarian reductions of Scripture by robustly defending biblical authority and supernatural revelation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in American Presbyterian seminaries and churches; formative for the Princeton tradition and late 19th‑century confessional revival. Continues to be a standard manual for Reformed pastors and catechists.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful as a compact systematic‑exegetical synthesis of classical Reformed doctrine; a dependable teaching and polemical resource for confessional theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Westminster Confession** - The structural framework Hodge explicates and defends as authoritative within Presbyterianism.
- **Sovereignty of God** - The controlling category for providence, election, and salvation.
- **Scriptural sufficiency / authority** - Scripture as the final rule for faith and life; basis for all Confessional statements.
- **Covenant theology** - Covenant of works and covenant of grace as organizing schema linking Adam and Christ, law and gospel.
- **Original sin / federal headship** - Adam's representative role and inherited corruption; foundational for need of redemption.
- **Penal substitution / imputation** - Christ's vicarious satisfaction and the forensic transfer of guilt/righteousness in justification.
- **Justification by faith alone** - Forensic declaration received by faith; distinguished from sanctification and assurance.
- **Means of grace** - Word, sacraments (infant baptism; Lord's Supper), and prayer as the divinely ordained channels for sanctification and assurance.
- **Hypostatic union / Christ's offices** - Affirmation of the two natures united in one person and the threefold office (Prophet, Priest, King) as the basis for mediation.
- **Regulative principle of worship** - Worship governed by Scripture's positive commands and examples.
- **Assurance and sanctification** - Assurance grounded objectively in Christ's work and subjectively in effects of grace; sanctification as progressive and cooperative.
- **Church & sacraments** - The visible church as covenant community; sacraments as seals and pledges of promise.
- **Eschatology** - Resurrection, final judgment, and eternal states treated as necessary corollaries of redemptive history.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed formulations (doctrine summaries, catechetical use).
 - As a **polemic** tool against Arminianism, liberalism, and alternative atonement theories.
 - As an **exegetical‑systematic model**: textual proofing of doctrinal claims and a teaching manual for pastors and seminaries.
