### TITLE
Strong and Weak: Embracing a Life of Love, Risk and True Flourishing - Andy Crouch (2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published 2016 amid renewed evangelical interest in cultural engagement, social ethics, and leadership formation. Positioned within contemporary evangelicalism that seeks alternatives to both triumphalistic dominionism and therapeutic victimhood. Interdisciplinary engagement with sociology, disability studies, arts, and leadership literature.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Christians must recover a robust, theologically shaped understanding of **power** as capacity to cultivate flourishing - a power that is properly both **strong** (effective, cultivated capacity) and **weak** (vulnerable, dependent, sacrificial). The problem addressed is the frequent bifurcation in Christian thinking between domination-power and powerless meekness.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Diagnoses modern and church errors: domination-as-control (abusive power) and crippling anti-power (passivity, moralizing weakness).
 - Re-frames power as **capacity** (abilities, virtues, institutions) that must be **formed** and exercised in love, often involving risk and vulnerability.
 - Grounds this vision biblically: Creation mandate (vocation/dominion reframed), the Incarnation and kenosis (Christ as decisive model), and the missional life of the church.
 - Offers practical grammar for institutions and individual vocation: formation, stewardship, subsidiarity, and practices that balance strength with dependence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Broad interlocutors across evangelical cultural critics, leaders in arts and business, disability-advocacy voices, and traditional theological texts (creation narratives, Pauline kenosis). Dialogues with both classical Protestant social ethics and contemporary cultural-power critics.
- **Doctrines treated:** Creation and the cultural/dominion mandate (vocation), imago Dei, incarnation and kenosis (Christology), providence and stewardship, sin and its distortion of power, ecclesiology (church as a practicing body), teleology/eschatology implied in flourishing.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The Christian life trains capacities to shape the world for flourishing - but those capacities are truly Christian only when they are yoked to vulnerability and sacrificial service modeled by the incarnate Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Power as **capacity** rather than mere force or domination; capacity is cultivated, shared and practiced.
 - The paradoxical unity **"strong and weak"** as normative Christian posture (not a choice between opposites).
 - Practical anthropology: virtues and skills matter; vocation is formation of capacities for common flourishing.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects dominionist readings that equate the cultural mandate with domination and control.
 - Challenges pietistic and therapeutic strands that valorize vulnerability as moral superiority without responsibility to cultivate strength.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts "power" vocabulary in constructive terms (capacity, formation, stewardship) and introduces "risk" as a virtuous element of exercised love.
 - Emphasizes institutional and embodied practices (arts, craft, governance) as loci of theological formation.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Widely read in evangelical leadership and cultural engagement circles; influential for pastors, lay leaders, and seminary courses on vocation and ethics.
 - Cited in conversations about Christian social witness, disability theology, and faith-and-work formation; less a systematic theology than a practical-theological corrective.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Provocative bridge between biblical doctrine (creation/kenosis) and practical disciplines (leadership, vocational formation).
 - Serves as a pedagogical tool for rethinking Christian power, vocation, and cultural stewardship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Power (as capacity):** Ability to shape world toward flourishing; not domination but cultivated competence and influence.
- **Strong:** The formed capacities, institutions, and competencies necessary to act effectively in the world.
- **Weak:** Dependence, vulnerability, sacrifice - relational modes that prevent domination and create space for flourishing.
- **Strong and Weak (paradox):** The normative Christian stance that integrates competence with vulnerability.
- **Vocation:** Ongoing formation of capacities in particular callings to serve common flourishing.
- **Dominion / Cultural Mandate:** Reinterpreted from control to responsible stewardship and cultivation of creation.
- **Stewardship:** The faithful exercise and formation of capacities entrusted by God.
- **Kenosis:** Christological model (self-emptying) that grounds the "weak" aspect of Christian power.
- **Flourishing:** Teleological horizon - human and communal well-being oriented by God's purposes.
- **Risk:** Necessary exposure and vulnerability entailed in practicing love and exercising power.
- **Formation:** Habitual practice and institutional shaping of capacities (skills, virtues, practices).
- **Subsidiarity (implicit):** Localized, responsible exercise of power and capacity rather than centralized domination.
- **Gift economy:** Emphasis on gifts and dependence rather than pure self-sufficiency.
- **Common grace:** Theological background for cultural engagement and shared flourishing.
- **Practices / Institutions:** Bodies and practices that cultivate and discharge capacities for flourishing.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for a theological vocabulary of power and vocation in courses on Christian social ethics and vocation.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in church leadership and faith-at-work training, reframing stewardship and cultural engagement.
 - As a **polemic** against dominionist misuse of Genesis and against forms of Christian passivity that avoid responsibility.
 - As an **exegetical-practical model** linking Genesis' cultural mandate with the kenotic Christ to guide embodied Christian practice.
