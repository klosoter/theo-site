### TITLE
Systematic Theology and Biblical Theology - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (New Dictionary of Biblical Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship addressing the methodological relationship between redemptive-historical (biblical) theology and doctrinal (systematic) theology.
 - Situated in the Vosian-Biblical Theology revival within conservative Reformed circles; corrective to both reductive historicism and ahistorical systematics.
- **Central thesis**
 - Biblical theology and systematic theology are distinct yet interdependent enterprises: biblical theology furnishes the progressive, redemptive-historical content and canonical shape of revelation; systematic theology formulates that content into doctrine under the guidance of the Spirit, preserving the Bible's Christ-centered telos.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition of the distinct tasks:
 - Biblical theology: description of revelation's historical development and typological promise-fulfillment trajectory culminating in Christ (see **Typology And Fulfillment**).
 - Systematic theology: doctrinal assimilation and coherent presentation of that revelation for teaching, confession, and discipleship.
 - Defence of Christocentric hermeneutic:
 - Typology is not incidental allegory but divinely intended promise-fulfillment; Old Testament types find normative fulfillment in Christ.
 - Methodological bridge:
 - Scripture must be allowed to interpret Scripture (analogia fidei) rather than subordinating Biblical witness to philosophical a priori (criticizing analogia entis tendencies) (see **Analogia Entis vs Analogia Fidei**).
 - Practical upshot:
 - Systematic theology should not abstract biblical data from its redemptive-historical context but should present doctrines shaped by the canonical, eschatological center in Christ.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Rooted in Geerhardus Vos's conception of biblical theology as history of redemption; dialogues with Warfield's confessional systematicism and with critiques influenced by Barth and twentieth-century historical-critical separations.
 - Engages contemporary biblical-theological movements that either over-describe (descriptive-only) or under-press (eventualist/ahistorical) Scripture.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (canon, promise-fulfillment), Christology (fulfillment as hermeneutical key), covenant theology (promise and administration), eschatology (telos and consummation), pneumatology (Spirit's role in appropriation), and doctrine-formation (method in systematics).
- **Closing line**
 - Gaffin centers theology on Scripture's redemptive-historical progress: biblical theology provides the Christocentric content and canonical shape that systematic theology must faithfully and doctrinally articulate.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that typology and fulfillment are normative hermeneutical categories: the OT's meaning is settled in the eschatological person and work of Christ.
 - Prioritizes the Bible's own canonical and telic ordering over purely historical or purely dogmatic reduction.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects approaches that treat biblical theology as a merely descriptive history with no doctrinal authority; resists systematic reductions that detach doctrines from their redemptive-historical moorings.
 - Opposes analogia entis (natural theological projection of God into thought) in favor of analogia fidei (doctrine emerges from Scripture's self-attestation).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Articulates a disciplined complementarity: biblical theology supplies normative content; systematic theology supplies coherent doctrinal expression - each constrained by Scripture's Christ-centered climax.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely received in conservative Reformed academic contexts as a clarifying corrective to both loose typologizing and sterile description; shaped seminary curricula emphasizing redemptive-historical preaching and doctrinal fidelity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Durable model for integrating exegesis, canonical theology, and doctrinal construction; influential for pastors, exegetes, and systematicians seeking a scripture-shaped theological method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Biblical theology**
 - The discipline tracing the progressive, historical revelation of God's redemptive acts within Scripture; supplies canonical, Christ-centered content.
- **Systematic theology**
 - The doctrinal articulation and coherent ordering of biblical truth for teaching and confession; must appropriate biblical-theological content.
- **Typology**
 - Divinely intended correspondences in redemptive history where persons/events/rites point forward and find fulfillment in Christ.
 - Emphasized as normative (not merely illustrative) for understanding OT meaning.
- **Fulfillment**
 - Eschatological realization of promise in Christ; hermeneutical key for canonical reading.
- **Analogia fidei (analogy of faith)**
 - The principle that Scripture interprets Scripture and doctrine is governed by the Bible's own faith and revelation.
 - Preferred over speculative metaphysical analogies for grounding theology.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being)**
 - Philosophical-theological notion that human and divine being have a proportional relation; treated critically as prone to subordinating revelation to natural theology.
- **Promise-fulfillment framework**
 - Covenantal theme where God's promises progress and reach consummation in Christ; central organizing axis.
- **Canonical redemptive-historical method**
 - Approach that reads the Bible as unified, goal-directed revelation culminating in Christ.
- **Christocentric hermeneutic**
 - Interpreting all Scripture in light of the person and work of Jesus as the center and telos.
- **Pneumatological appropriation**
 - The Spirit's role in applying Christ's work and enabling theological formulation.
- **Exegetical-model**
 - Uses typology + promise-fulfillment as primary exegetical tools for connecting Testaments.
- **Dogmatic restraint**
 - Systematic theology must be disciplined by the Bible's narrative and canonical shape.
- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: to define and delimit biblical vs systematic tasks for syllabi and methodological introductions.
 - Polemic use: as a corrective against analogia entis-driven natural theology and against descriptive-only biblical theology.
 - Exegetical model/conceptual pivot: as a guiding schema for typological interpretation, canonical readings, and doctrine-formation that keeps Christ as hermeneutical center.
