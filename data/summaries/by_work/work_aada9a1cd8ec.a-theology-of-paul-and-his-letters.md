### TITLE
A Theology of Paul and His Letters - Douglas J. Moo

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary evangelical scholarship within late 20th-early 21st century Reformed/evangelical theological milieu. Written as a systematic reading of Paul that combines close exegesis with constructive theological synthesis against the backdrop of debates triggered by the New Perspective on Paul.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Paul's theology is coherent and centered on the person and work of Christ such that justification, union with Christ, the people of God, and new-creation eschatology form an integrated theological system. The book aims to show how Pauline soteriology, ecclesiology, and ethics interlock and to correct misreadings that separate forensic/legal and relational/covenantal aspects of Paul.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Letter-by-letter exegesis of Paul's major letters to establish primary data and contexts.
 - Thematic synthesis drawing out Pauline teachings on Christology, justification, sanctification, the Spirit, the people of God, law/torah, and eschatology.
 - Systematic engagement with contemporary interlocutors to defend a balanced, historically grounded evangelical reading.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive engagement with Pauline commentators and historians of recent decades; frequent critical dialogue with New Perspective proponents (E.P. Sanders, J.D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright), while dialoguing with conservative commentators (e.g., Leon Morris, John Stott) and contemporary exegetes.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation (apostolic and Christocentric), Christology (exalted and crucified Christ), justification (forensic and relational dimensions), covenant and people of God, Holy Spirit and sanctification, law/torah, ethics, sin and atonement, eschatology/new creation, ecclesiology, apostolic authority.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Paul's letters present a coherent gospel centered on union with Christ that grounds justification, community identity, ethical transformation, and inaugurated eschatology-integrating forensic proclamation and covenantal participation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses **both** forensic justification and corporate/relational dimensions (union with Christ) rather than collapsing one into the other.
 - Emphasizes **new-creation** as the telos that unites soteriology, Spirit, and ethics.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back on strong versions of the New Perspective that reduce justification to intra-Jewish boundary markers by defending classical Protestant readings while acknowledging covenantal language.
 - Corrects older pietistic readings that privatize justification apart from corporate identity and eschatological hope.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Favors language that integrates **participation** (in Christ) with **declaration** (justification) to avoid polarities.
 - Helpful insistence on reading Paul as a theologian of **peoplehood** and **new creation**, not only individual soteriology.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in evangelical seminaries as a reliable, moderate corrective to both libertarian and revisionist readings.
 - Cited in debates over justification, the New Perspective, and Pauline hermeneutics; respected for exegetical rigor and constructive clarity.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a model for integrating detailed exegesis with systematic theology and for teaching Paul as both ancient apostle and theological architect of gospel doctrines.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification:** Forensic declaration of righteousness rooted in Christ's work, interpreted in relation to union with Christ; not reduced to mere judicial fiction, nor to socio-religious status only.
- **Righteousness of God:** God's covenant faithfulness and the status he grants believers; Moo treats it as both declarative and relational.
- **Union with Christ:** Central relational category explaining participation in Christ's death, resurrection, and present-standing; grounds sanctification and eschatological hope.
- **Covenant / people of God:** Paul's theology as continuity with Israel's covenantal story; the church as the renewed/extended people of God.
- **New creation:** Eschatological framework that unites redemption, ethics, and the Spirit; the present reality and future consummation.
- **Law / Torah (works of the law):** Interpreted in light of covenantal markers; Moo critiques overly narrow sociological readings that ignore theological/legal aspects.
- **Gospel (euangelion):** The proclamation of Christ crucified/exalted bringing justification, reconciliation, and inaugurating new creation.
- **Spirit and sanctification:** The Spirit as the agent of present participation in resurrection life and moral transformation.
- **Eschatology (realized/inaugurated):** Emphasis on inaugurated eschatology-already-but-not-yet tension structuring Paul's pastoral and ethical teaching.
- **Participation / communion terminology:** How believers share in Christ's benefits (death, resurrection, life) and status.
- **Sin and death:** Universal problem overcome in Christ; expounded with forensic and ontological consequences.
- **Ethics / moral formation:** Rooted in union with Christ and new-creation imperatives, not mere rule-following.
- **Apostolic authority / canon:** Paul's letters as authoritative, pastoral, and theologically foundational.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Pauline soteriology in evangelical/Reformed curricula (balancing forensic and participatory models).
- As a **polemic** against reductive readings of the New Perspective while engaging its insights constructively.
- As an **exegetical model** for integrating letter-level study with theological synthesis and for teaching Paul across biblical-theological loci.
