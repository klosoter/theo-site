### TITLE
The Problem of Adam and the Solution of Christ - Thomas Schreiner

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Contemporary evangelical-Reformed scholarship; Schreiner writes from late 20th-early 21st century North American Reformed theology, engaging modern Pauline scholarship and debates about original sin and corporate identity.
- **Central thesis:** Adam functions as humanity's federal head whose disobedience brings culpability and death to his descendants; Christ as the new/last Adam effects the decisive reversal by his righteous obedience and imputed righteousness, so that union with Christ is the solution to the Adamic problem.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation in Pauline texts, especially **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**, reading Adam and Christ as corporate representatives.
 - Theological clarification of how sin, guilt, and death are transmitted: rejection of purely existential or non-imputational models; defense of **immediate federal imputation** (Adam's sin counted to the many).
 - Systematic articulation: connection of federal headship to doctrines of covenant, original sin, total depravity, and justification - showing how Christ's righteousness is imputed to believers through union with him.
 - Pastoral and polemical application: diagnosing contemporary evasions of original sin (Pelagian trends, modern individualism) and rehearsing the gospel remedy (union with Christ, justification by faith).
- **Figures and interlocutors engaged:** classical sources (Augustine, Calvin), Reformed interpreters (Murray, B. B. Warfield), and contemporary critics of traditional imputation theories (various New Perspective leanings, Eastern Orthodox "ancestral sin" positions, semi-Pelagian tendencies).
- **Doctrines treated:** sin and original sin, federal headship, imputation (guilt and righteousness), covenant theology (covenant of works/ covenant of grace), Christology (Christ as Second Adam), justification, union with Christ, soteriology.
- **Closing line:** The theological center of gravity is that humanity's ruin in Adam is corporate and forensic, and only the corporate, forensic remedy in Christ-union and imputation-answers the problem.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Firm defense of federal headship:** Schreiner emphasizes Adam and Christ as representative heads rather than merely exemplary figures or metaphors; representation is ontologically and legally decisive.
- **Exegesis-driven systematic theology:** Uses close readings of Paul to ground high-level doctrinal claims (notably Romans 5:12-21 and 1 Corinthians 15:21-22, 45-49).
- **Clear distinction between imputation types:** Differentiates **guilt** imputed from Adam and **righteousness** imputed from Christ, resisting conflations with mere propensity or inherited inclination.
- **Rejection of non-imputation models:** Critiques views that reduce original sin to environment, imitation, or "ancestral sin" without forensic accounting of guilt; opposes softening of penitential and forensic dimensions of sin.
- **Correction to rivals:**
 - Against Pelagian/Arminian minimization of inherited guilt: insists on inherited culpability and total depravity's soteriological consequences.
 - Against some New Perspective tendencies that treat Paul primarily as covenantal nomism critic: maintains classical reading that Adamic sin and Christ's righteousness have universal forensic effects.
 - Distinguishes from Eastern Orthodox language of ancestral consequence by reaffirming judicial imputation rather than solely ontological corruption.
- **Reception and influence:** Widely cited in Reformed seminaries and evangelical contexts as a succinct modern defense of federal theology; used in curricular treatments of soteriology and original sin. Stimulates continued debate with scholars who prefer alternative models of representation and transmission.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a compact, exegetically anchored, systematically coherent resource for teaching the classical Protestant doctrine of sin and redemption; valuable for clarifying how union with Christ functions as the antidote to Adamic ruin.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adam (federal head):** The representative first human whose act of disobedience brings legal condemnation to his progeny.
- **Christ (New/Second Adam):** The corporate representative whose obedience and death secure justification and life for those united to him.
- **Federal headship / representation:** The framework by which one person's act legally binds many; central explanatory category.
- **Imputation (guilt):** The immediate forensic counting of Adam's trespass to humanity; grounds condemnation.
- **Imputation (righteousness):** The forensic reckoning of Christ's righteousness to believers; ground of justification.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological and relational instrument by which believers partake in Christ's status (death and resurrection) and receive imputations.
- **Original sin:** The inherited corruption and guilt stemming from Adam's fall; both ontological depravity and forensic culpability are affirmed.
- **Covenant of works / covenant of grace:** The covenantal schema explaining Adam's failing and Christ's redemptive role as covenant head.
- **Total depravity:** The doctrine that sin affects all aspects of human nature, rendering human will incapable of saving righteousness apart from Christ.
- **Romans 5 exegesis:** The pivotal Pauline locus used to argue for representative, imputed culpability and remedy.
- **Representative vs. seminal headship:** Distinguishes corporate/legal representation (federal) from biological descent explanations; Schreiner tends to integrate both but centers federal representation.
- **Ancestral sin (contrast):** Eastern framing stressing consequence and mortality without the same forensic imputation; Schreiner contrasts and critiques its adequacy for Pauline theology.
- **Pelagian/Arminian critique:** Labels and corrects modern denials or mitigations of inherited guilt and radical human inability.
- **Forensic / federal anthropology:** Anthropological stance that sees human plight as juridical and covenantal, not merely biological or existential.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for federal headship and classical imputation models.
- As a **polemic** against non-imputational or softened doctrines of original sin.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 within Reformed soteriology.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on covenant theology, linking Adam-Christ typology to justification and union.
