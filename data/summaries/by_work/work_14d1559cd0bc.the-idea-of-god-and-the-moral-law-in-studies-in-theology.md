### TITLE
The Idea of God and the Moral Law - B. B. Warfield (essay in Studies in Theology)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context:** Early 20th-century Princeton theology (Warfield, professor at Princeton Seminary). Part of Studies in Theology, written amid reaction to liberal theology, evolutionary naturalism, and emergent ethical naturalism. Battles over divine attributes, authority of Scripture, and grounding of ethics form the milieu.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem:** Moral law is neither autonomous human preference nor arbitrary divine fiat but is rooted in the eternal, moral nature of God - specifically in the interplay of His **absolute** and **relative** attributes. Thus objective moral obligation obtains because it issues from God's immutable moral character and relational purposes.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Clarifies the distinction between God's absolute attributes (immutability, aseity, simplicity, holiness as intrinsic properties) and relative attributes (mercy, love, righteousness as exercised toward creatures).
 - Argues that the moral law expresses God's eternal holiness (absolute attribute) as mediated through His relational will (relative attributes); commands are not brute acts ungrounded in character.
 - Rejects moral voluntarism that makes obligation depend solely on arbitrary divine will; likewise rejects moral naturalism and subjectivism which ground obligation in feeling, reason detached from God, or social convention.
 - Maintains God's freedom and sovereignty while insisting God's will is not capricious - God's moral commands flow necessarily from His moral nature.
 - Employs biblical exegesis, classical theism, and Reformed confessional resources to argue for a theistic ontology of ethics.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors engaged:** Implied engagement with Kantian autonomy and Humean sentimentalism; critiques of theological voluntarists and ethical naturalists. Draws on Scripture, Augustine/Calvin via Reformed tradition, and scholastic categories (attributes distinction).
- **Doctrines treated:** Theology proper (divine attributes, simplicity, holiness), moral theology (law, obligation), revelation (Scripture as witness to God's character), and implications for anthropology and sanctification.
- **Closing line:** The essay centers on the conviction that objective moral law is intelligible and binding because it is the outward articulation of the eternal, holy nature of God - where His absolute attributes secure moral normativity and His relative attributes mediate obligation toward creatures.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Precise and systematic use of the **absolute vs. relative attributes** distinction to solve the tension between divine immutability and divine moral action.
 - Integration of classical theistic metaphysics with Reformed moral theology rather than reducing ethics to legalism or to abstract metaphysics alone.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Corrects simplistic voluntarism (God-as-lawgiver-as-arbitrary-will) by rooting commands in God's nature.
 - Opposes modern moral autonomy (Kantian self-legislation) and naturalistic reductionism by reasserting the primacy of divine character as normative.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts the standard scholastic attribute-talk as an ethical apologetic: the attribute distinction is not merely metaphysical but directly relevant to moral obligation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Influential within conservative Reformed and Princeton circles as a clear corrective to theological liberalism and moral subjectivism.
 - Cited in later Reformed systematic and apologetic works addressing grounding of ethics and theistic metaphysics.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models disciplined interplay of metaphysics, exegesis, and moral theory.
 - Remains useful for courses on divine attributes, ethical theory in theology, and apologetics against ethical naturalism/voluntarism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Absolute attributes:** Intrinsic, non-relational properties of God (immutability, aseity, simplicity, holiness as intrinsic). Ground the permanence and objectivity of moral norms.
- **Relative attributes:** God's properties in relation to creatures (mercy, love, providence, justice in exercise). Show how God's eternal character governs particular moral commands.
- **Moral law:** Objective normative demands that issue from God's character; not mere human convention or arbitrary decree.
- **Ground of obligation:** The metaphysical source of moral bindingness; Warfield locates this in God's moral nature rather than human will or social utility.
- **Voluntarism (theological):** View that moral law depends solely on God's will; Warfield critiques its arbitrariness.
- **Intellectualism (ethical):** View that morality is grounded in reason or eternal principles independent of God; Warfield rejects a divorcing of moral law from divine character.
- **Natural law:** The doctrine that moral truths are accessible by reason from created order; Warfield affirms a qualified natural law but insists its ultimate warrant is divine.
- **Divine holiness:** Central absolute attribute; for Warfield the primary moral predicate from which law flows.
- **Immutability:** God's unchanging nature; secures consistency of moral norms over time.
- **Sovereignty:** God's rule over creation; affirmed but constrained conceptually by God's moral nature (not caprice).
- **Revelation:** Scripture as the decisive witness to God's moral nature and concrete content of the law.
- **Eternal law:** God's unchanging moral order mirroring His character; both source and standard.
- **Moral autonomy (Kantian):** Contrasted and critiqued as inadequate to account for objective bindingness.
- **Absolute And Relative Attributes (topic cited):** Used as primary analytical lens - the essay is a locus classicus in Reformed use of this distinction to reconcile God's transcendence and moral action.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for the Reformed understanding of divine attributes and their ethical import.
- As a **polemic resource** against voluntarist and naturalistic accounts of moral obligation.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses linking theology proper to moral theology and apologetics.
