### TITLE
"Union with Christ: The Reformed Perspective" - Sinclair B. Ferguson, in Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology (2006). Short essay articulating the classical Reformed account of union with Christ and its place in soteriology, covenant theology, and sacramental practice.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century Reformed renewal; evangelical scholarly engagement with classical Reformed sources (Calvin, Owen) and contemporary debates about the structure of salvation.
 - Ferguson writes from a conservative Reformed/Wesleyan-pastoral background (Scottish, Westminster-influenced), addressing seminarians, pastors, and theologians.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Union with Christ is the central, formative reality of salvation**: it is the ontological and covenantal bond by which believers receive all soteriological benefits (justification, adoption, sanctification, glorification). Union is neither reducible to forensic imputation nor merely a consequence of other soteriological acts.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical opening: Pauline texts (esp. Romans, Galatians, Ephesians) establish the reality and primacy of union language.
 - Historical-theological survey: traces patristic, medieval, and Reformation treatments-shows continuity with Calvin and Owen while correcting modern distortions.
 - Doctrinal synthesis: locates union as the logically prior bond that grounds imputation, regeneration, and sacramental participation.
 - Practical and sacramental implications: union explains the efficacy of Word and sacrament (baptism and the Lord's Supper) as means of participation in Christ.
 - Methodological note: resists sharp separation of ordo salutis and historia salutis; insists union must inform both the logical ordering of salvation and its historical application.

- **Figures / interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary retrieval: John Calvin, John Owen, classical Reformed confessions.
 - Contemporary interlocutors: modern evangelical soteriologies that prioritize forensic accounts or that treat benefits as atomized events; engages recent treatments that split ordo salutis from objective union.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Soteriology (union, justification, sanctification, adoption)
 - Christology (person and work of Christ as the basis for union)
 - Covenant theology (federal headship, covenantal participation)
 - Pneumatology (Spirit as the bond and agent effecting union)
 - Sacramentology (Word and sacraments as means of union)
 - Ecclesiology (the church as the community of union)

- **Closing line**
 - Union with Christ is the **theological knot** tying together the objective accomplishment of Christ and the subjective appropriation of redemption; it must be privileged in both doctrinal construction and pastoral ordering of salvation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that union is **ontological/relational**, not merely forensic or nominal; it is the matrix in which all benefits are conferred.
 - Clear linkage of union to sacramental practice: sacraments are means of participation, not mere signs.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters accounts that reduce soteriology to imputation of righteousness alone; pushes back on pietistic individualism that treats sanctification and justification as disconnected.
 - Challenges sharp bifurcation between ordo salutis (logical order) and historia salutis (historical/chronological order) by arguing union must govern both.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Re-frames union as the **prior explanatory category** for imputation, regeneration, and application of redemption rather than as an after-effect.
 - Emphasizes the Spirit as the personal bond of union (not an abstract legal link).

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries and pastoral training as a corrective to overly forensic or functional accounts of salvation.
 - Helped catalyze renewed emphasis on union in evangelical systematic theology and in preaching on sacraments.

- **Enduring value**
 - Clarifies the unity of Christian soteriology; serves as a concise, pastorally sensitive synthesis linking doctrine and practice; valuable as both a scholarly retrenchment and a homiletical resource.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - the fundamental relational bond by which believers are joined to Christ; the fountainhead of all soterial benefits.
- **Imputation** - forensic accounting of Christ's righteousness; dependent upon and grounded in union rather than rival to it.
- **Ordo salutis** - the logical ordering of salvation; Ferguson insists union must be given primacy in the ordo.
 - Relation to historia salutis: Ferguson resists isolating the ordo from the historical unfolding (historia) of redemption.
- **Historia salutis** - the historical outworking of salvation events; must be read through the lens of union, not abstract chronology.
- **Federal headship** - Christ as representative/head; union is the personal-covenantal link between head and members.
- **Regeneration** - new life in Christ effected by the Spirit as part of participation in the union.
- **Pneumatic bond** - the Holy Spirit as the agent and sustaining bond of union.
- **Sacramental participation** - baptism and Eucharist as means by which believers are publicly and spiritually incorporated into Christ.
- **Sanctification** - growth in holiness that flows from and remains within the union, not a parallel or independent process.
- **Justification** - declared righteous before God; its efficacy is rooted in and explained by union with Christ.
- **Adoption** - familial status conferred through union; the social/relational consequences of being in Christ.
- **Mystical vs. forensic language** - Ferguson rehabilitates "mystical union" language while maintaining strict forensic categories where appropriate.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "union with Christ" in soteriological treatments.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist forensic-only soteriologies and against strict separation of ordo and historia salutis.
- As an **exegetical model** for Pauline union texts and for integrating sacramental theology with systematic soteriology.
