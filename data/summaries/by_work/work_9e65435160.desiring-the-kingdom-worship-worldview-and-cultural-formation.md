### TITLE
**Desiring the Kingdom: Worship, Worldview, and Cultural Formation** - James K. A. Smith

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2009 as first volume in Smith's Cultural Liturgies trilogy; emerges from late-20th / early-21st century Anglo-American Reformed and evangelical contexts.
 - Engages the "practice turn" in theology and the social sciences, reacting to faith-as-primarily-propositional models of religion and to secularization narratives in modernity.
- **Central thesis**
 - Human beings are first and foremost *desiring* animals shaped by practices (liturgies); worship (and rival liturgies) forms our loves and thereby our worldview. Christian formation must recover liturgical practices that reorder loves toward the kingdom.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: Modernity presumes that belief follows ideas; therefore formation is conceived as cognitive persuasion. This model is inadequate.
 - Anthropological claim: People are habituated through embodied practices; desires (not primarily ideas) drive action and understanding.
 - Cultural claim: All social institutions are *liturgies*-rituals and practices that inculcate loves and imaginaries (e.g., malls, universities, sports, politics).
 - Theological proposal: Christian worship (proper liturgy) is the primary formative practice for cultivating love of God's kingdom; Christian formation must attend to practices that reorder desires.
 - Pastoral implication: Evangelism and discipleship should focus less on mere propositional assent and more on shaping practices, rhythms, and liturgies that form hearts.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws heavily on **Augustine** (ordered loves), **Alasdair MacIntyre** (practices and virtues), **Charles Taylor** (secular age, social imaginaries), **Dietrich Bonhoeffer** (formation through community and worship), and contemporary practice-theory and phenomenology resources.
 - Intervenes against modern apologetic models and against the privatized, cognitive model of religion dominant in much evangelicalism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Anthropological: human desire, habit, formation.
 - Ecclesiology: church as formative community; worship as central practice.
 - Sacramental & liturgical theology: practices as means of grace and formation.
 - Epistemology/worldview: critique of "worldview as propositional" in favor of embodied formation.
 - Soteriology/ethics: sanctification as reordering of loves toward the kingdom.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: Christian truth is realized not just in correct beliefs but in reformed desires and embodied practices-worship forms the heart to desire the kingdom.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Replaces the modern primacy of cognition with an anthropology of *desire* and *habituation*; centers *liturgies* (broadly defined) as the key analytic category for cultural theology.
 - Treats secular institutions (consumerism, higher education, sports) as rival liturgies that shape discipleship as effectively as explicit religious practices.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects liberal/evangelical assumptions that conversion is primarily intellectual assent; contrasts with apologetic models that privilege propositional argument.
 - Moves beyond merely moralizing critiques of culture to analyze how practices produce inner orientations (loves, habits).
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Cultural liturgies" - an interpretive tool applying liturgical theory to secular formations.
 - Emphasis on *kinesthetic/affective* formation: attention to how bodies and rhythms inculcate desires.
 - Re-articulation of "worldview" as an embodied formation rather than only a set of beliefs.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and evangelical academic and church contexts; adopted in worship renewal, seminary curricula, and cultural theology.
 - Catalyzed further work on practices, formation, and cultural critique among pastoral theologians, ethicists, and public theologians.
 - Criticized by some for underplaying the propositional content of doctrine and for ambiguous political implications of "formation."
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust corrective to purely cognitive models of religion; offers practical vocabulary for worship and discipleship formation.
 - A durable bridge between liturgical theology, cultural critique, and pastoral practice.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Desire** - central anthropological category; drives action and interpretation; formation aims to reorder desire toward God.
- **Liturgies / Cultural liturgies** - practices and rituals (religious and secular) that form loves and imaginaries; primary unit of analysis.
- **Formation / Formative practices** - sustained communal practices (rhythms, rites, habits) that cultivate identity and orientation.
- **Ordered loves (ordo amoris)** - Augustinian motif: virtue as right-ordered love; salvation as reorientation of loves.
- **Worldview (recast)** - not merely propositional beliefs but an embodied, practiced set of habits and imaginaries produced by liturgies.
- **Worship (broad sense)** - the formative practices that constitute identity; not limited to Sunday services but inclusive of daily rhythms that shape desire.
- **Habitus / embodied cognition** - notion that the body and habits structure perception and judgment (draws on practice-theory).
- **Secularization as liturgical displacement** - modern "secular" institutions function as liturgies replacing liturgical Christian formation.
- **Imagination / social imaginary** - shared narratives and images cultivated by liturgies that shape what counts as flourishing.
- **Kingdom desire** - the telos of formation: desiring God's reign; practical orientation toward common good and justice.
- **Practice turn** - Smith's alignment with theological and social-scientific emphasis on practices over mere ideas.
- **Formation-focused evangelism** - pastoral strategy emphasizing embodied discipleship over primarily propositional apologetics.
- **Rival liturgies** - competitors to Christian formation (consumerism, nationalism, academia) that vie for ultimate allegiances.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a definitional source for an **anthropology of desire** and for doctrines of formation and ecclesial practice.
- As a polemic against **propositional apologetics** and privatized accounts of belief in pastoral theology and evangelism.
- As a practical model for **worship design, discipleship programs, and curricular formation** in seminaries and congregations.
