### TITLE
The Path of Faith: A Biblical Theology of Covenant and Law - Brandon D. Crowe

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary biblical-theological study emerging from recent canonical and covenantal conversations in evangelical and Reformed circles. Engages both historic Reformed covenant theology and post-1970s debates about the law in Second Temple and Pauline studies.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** The law (Torah/nomos) functions covenantally as a formative "path" that shapes covenant faithfulness; proper biblical theology must integrate law and covenant such that faith and obedience are covenantal correlates rather than mutually exclusive alternatives.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Part I: Conceptual groundwork - definitions of covenant, law, faith, and the metaphor of a "path" (roadway, formation, pilgrimage).
 - Part II: Old Testament witness - how the Mosaic covenant, Torah, and cultic practice function as covenantal instruction directing Israel's faithfulness and identity.
 - Part III: Intertestamental and Pauline reception - how Second Temple thought and Paul interpreted "works of the law" and covenant markers; re-assesses common readings of covenantal nomism.
 - Part IV: Christ and the New Covenant - Christ as the climactic interpreter and fulfilment of the path, reorienting law toward fulfilled covenant obedience and eschatological faith.
 - Part V: Ecclesial and pastoral implications - how churches preach law and gospel, shape discipleship, and frame sacramental life under the new covenant.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Close reading of biblical canonical texts; dialogue with Reformed figures (e.g., Calvin, Vos), contemporary biblical theologians and Pauline critics (implicitly responding to covenantal-nomism and New Perspective voices), and Second Temple parallels. Uses historical-theological and canonical-critical methods.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation, covenant (Mosaic and new), law (Torah/nomos), justification, sanctification, Christology (Jesus as fulfilment/interpreter), ecclesiology, eschatology, typology.
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** The law is best understood not as a rival to grace but as the covenantal path that forms and directs faith, completed and transformed in Christ so that genuine covenantal faith issues in covenantal obedience.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Uses **"path"** metaphor consistently to reconceive law as formative guidance rather than merely boundary or forensic charge.
 - Prioritizes canonical and covenantal continuity: law remains central after Christ, now reoriented within the new covenant.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce Torah to mere legalism or temporary regulation; also challenges simplistic antinomian or purely forensic accounts of Pauline theology.
 - Reframes elements of the New Perspective by insisting on covenantal faith as inherently tied to obedience without collapsing law into works-righteousness.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - "Covenantal path" as a technical phrase for the normative function of law across covenants.
 - Taxonomy of law reframed in relational/covenantal terms (directional, identificatory, formative) rather than only moral/ceremonial/civil.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Adopted modestly in seminary courses on biblical theology and law; appreciated as an exegetical corrective in pastors' circles concerned about law-gospel preaching.
 - Not primarily polemical; serves more as a synthesizing resource than a sharp controversion of major camps.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Clarifies pastoral implications of law's continuity and discontinuity.
 - Provides a usable canonical model for preaching, catechesis, and doctrine that keeps faith and obedience integrated.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant:** Relational framework governing God's promises and human response; primary matrix in which law functions.
- **Law (Torah / nomos):** Canonical instruction that structures covenant life; read as formative "path" rather than only legal code.
- **Path (covenantal path):** Central metaphor-law as way of life that directs faith into covenantal fidelity.
- **Faith:** Covenant response characterized by trust and covenantal fidelity; not antithetical to obedience.
- **Obedience:** Fruit and sign of covenant faith; normative for both Old and New covenant communities.
- **Fulfillment (pleroma):** Christ's interpretive and salvific completion of the law's telos; recasts law within the new covenant.
- **Works of the law:** Reassessed in communal and boundary terms; distinguished from merit-based righteousness.
- **Covenantal nomism:** Engages this category critically-accepts some descriptive value but insists on theological nuance that preserves law's formative role.
- **Typology:** Law and institutions as foreshadowing Christ's covenantal work; typological reading rather than abolitionist reading of Torah.
- **Identification markers:** How law functions to mark the covenant community (ritual/civil dimensions reinterpreted).
- **Justification & sanctification:** Forensic declaration and progressive covenantal formation both necessary; integrated in the path metaphor.
- **Canonical reading:** Methodological posture treating Old and New Testaments as a unified narrative on covenant and law.
- **Eschatological orientation:** Law points toward ultimate covenant consummation in Christ.
- **Pastoral catechesis:** Practical application area emphasizing law as guide for discipleship and community formation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for integrating law and gospel in preaching and catechesis.
 - As an **exegetical model** in courses on covenant theology or biblical theology emphasizing canonical continuity.
 - As a **polemic/resource** against both antinomian tendencies and reductive "works-based" readings of Torah in Pauline debate.
