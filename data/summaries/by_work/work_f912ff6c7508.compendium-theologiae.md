### TITLE
Compendium Theologiae - Thomas Aquinas (mid-13th century, Dominican scholastic synthesis)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-13th century scholasticism; Dominican teaching milieu; pedagogical compendium synthesizing Scripture, Augustine, the Church Fathers, and Aristotelian philosophy for university and convent instruction.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To present a compact, systematic exposition of Christian doctrine that orders creation, Christ, and sacraments toward the final end: the beatific vision. Theology integrates revealed truth with rational demonstration, centering on Christ as mediator of salvation.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Opening: God as first cause and Trinity; order of knowledge (faith and reason).
 - Creation and providence; angels and human nature.
 - Sin, grace, and justification; the economy of sacraments.
 - Christology: eternal Sonship, Incarnation, hypostatic union and offices of Christ.
 - Eschatology: death, resurrection, final judgment, and new creation; interpretation of symbolic eschatological texts (e.g., Revelation).
 - Practical pastoral conclusions for sacramental and moral life.
- **Major moves (sub-bullets):**
 - Defends **eternal generation** of the Son while distinguishing the **temporal act of Incarnation**.
 - Insists on the **Chalcedonian formula**: one Person (hypostasis), two natures (without confusion, change, division, or separation).
 - Reads apocalyptic literature largely **figuratively** where doctrine or coherence with creedal faith requires (millennium as symbolic of the Church era).
 - Balances **realized** (present reign of grace) and **future** eschatology (bodily resurrection, final consummation).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Scripture (OT and NT), Augustine, the Church Fathers, Peter Lombard, Aristotle (via Latin reception), contemporary scholastics; polemical targets include literalist millenarians and heterodox Christologies.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity, revelation, Christology (eternal Sonship, Incarnation, hypostatic union), soteriology (sin, grace, justification), sacraments, angels, eschatology (resurrection, new creation, millennium).
- **Closing line:** A concise Thomistic synthesis that locates all doctrine in the Incarnate Son ordered toward the beatific vision, combining metaphysical precision with biblical and pastoral orientation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on the **distinction between eternal relations in the Trinity and temporal acts** in redemption (e.g., Son eternally generated; Incarnation occurs in time).
 - Readily integrates Aristotelian metaphysics (act/potency, form/matter) into doctrinal explanation without subordinating mystery to philosophy.
 - Eschatology is **both realized and future**: the Church participates in Christ's reign now, yet awaits bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Explicit rejection of millenarian literalism (e.g., Joachimine or chiliasmatic readings): the thousand years of Revelation 20 are **figurative** of the Church's present dominion, not a future earthly golden age.
 - Clarifies Chalcedonian vocabulary against both Nestorian and Monophysite misreadings by rigorous distinction of person and nature.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clear deployment of the **analogia entis** and formal/real distinctions to ground talk of divine persons and human participation.
 - Application of scholastic method to compress larger works (Summa) into a teaching compendium.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in medieval classrooms and later Thomist revival; authoritative in Catholic instruction on Trinity, Christology, and sacramental theology.
 - Received cautiously by Reformed theologians: admired for clarity and biblical fidelity but critiqued on sacramental and some metaphysical grounds.
- **Enduring value:** Serves as a compact entry to Thomistic dogmatics - prized for disciplined method, exemplary fusion of Scripture and metaphysics, and prudent exegesis on contested eschatological passages.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eternal generation:** Son's origin within the Godhead; real relation distinguished from temporal begetting.
- **Incarnation:** Eternal Son assuming human nature in time; unity of person with two natures (hypostatic union).
- **Hypostatic union / Chalcedonian formula:** One Person (Christ) in two natures, unconfused and unseparated - central Thomistic Christology.
- **Person vs. nature:** Critical distinction to avoid Nestorian/Monophysite errors; person = who, nature = what.
- **Resurrection (bodily) & New Creation:** Final restoration of body and world; continuity and transformation (glorified body).
- **Millennium (Revelation 20):** Interpreted **figuratively** as the Church-age reign of Christ; not a literal earthly thousand-year kingdom.
 - Sub-bullet: "Satan bound" = restraint effected by the Gospel and sacramental order, not total absence of evil.
- **Realized vs Future eschatology:** Present participation in Christ's reign (grace, sacraments) vs. future consummation (resurrection, judgment).
- **Messianic consciousness and kingdom:** Christ consciously fulfills prophetic office; kingdom is inaugurated now and consummated later.
- **Analogia entis:** Principle allowing predication of God analogically from creatures; undergirds theological language.
- **Sacramental economy:** Means by which Christ communicates grace; connected to Incarnation and eschatological hope.
- **Final judgment / beatific vision:** Culmination and telos of all doctrine.
- **Trinitarian revelation (OT & NT):** OT prefigurations and NT explicit formulas (Baptismal Trinitarian confession; Johannine theology) support doctrine.
- **Satan's binding (eschatological role):** Pastoral-exegetical reading linking Revelation to present Church mission.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Thomistic positions on Chalcedon, eternal generation, and hypostatic union.
- As a **polemic** resource against chiliasm and heterodox Christologies.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Revelation 20 non-literalistically (present Church-age binding).
- As a **conceptual pivot** integrating metaphysics (act/potency, analogy) with biblical doctrine for teaching Trinity, Christology, and eschatology.
