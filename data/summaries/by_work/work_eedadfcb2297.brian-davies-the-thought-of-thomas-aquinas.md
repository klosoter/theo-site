### TITLE
Brian Davies, The Thought of Thomas Aquinas - a concise analytic reading of Thomas Aquinas (late 20th-century scholarly edition; modern Thomist/analytic-historical approach)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century analytic Thomism: Davies writes as a professionally trained philosopher-theologian aiming to make Aquinas intelligible to contemporary analytic and systematic theology.
 - Milieu: reaction to both historically oriented medieval scholarship and to modern analytic theology; engages scholastic sources while emphasizing conceptual clarity.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Aquinas presents a unified metaphysical-theological system in which God as pure act grounds being, knowledge and providence; theological doctrines (grace, predestination, sacraments) must be read as corollaries of metaphysical commitments.
 - Davies argues that Aquinas secures divine sovereignty and human moral responsibility without incoherence.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Method: close reading of primary Thomistic texts filtered through analytic categories (being/act, necessity/contingency, causation).
 - Major moves:
 - Establish Aquinas' metaphysical foundations: act-potency, esse/essentia, divine simplicity.
 - Derive divine attributes (omniscience, omnipotence, immutability) from those foundations.
 - Show how providence and government of creatures are compatible with secondary causality and creaturely contingency.
 - Treat moral theology: grace, merit, assurance and perseverance in system with divine decrees and election.
 - Uses case studies to resolve classic problems: foreknowledge and future contingency; theodicy; divine decrees and human freedom.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Thomas Aquinas (Summa Theologiae, Summa Contra Gentiles, Commentaries).
 - Interlocutors: Aristotle, Augustine; medievals (e.g., Bonaventure, Duns Scotus, Suárez) and modern critics from Calvinist and Molinist camps.
 - Contemporary conversation partners: analytic philosophers of religion and systematic theologians.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Metaphysics (being, essence/ existence), Trinity and divine attributes, providence, foreknowledge, Creation, sin and theodicy (privation theory), grace (sufficient vs efficacious), predestination, election and reprobation, assurance/perseverance, moral theology.

- **Closing line**
 - Davies reads Aquinas as a metaphysically grounded theologian who defends a coherent account of divine sovereignty and human freedom: God ordains and foreknows without arbitrariness, evil is privation permitted for greater goods, and perseverance depends on efficacious grace within a system of single predestination (see discussions on Divine Foreknowledge, Providence and the Problem of Evil; Assurance and Perseverance; Divine Decrees, Election and Reprobation).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Analytic precision: prioritizes conceptual unpacking (necessary vs. contingent truth, causal explanatory depth) over purely historical reconstruction.
 - Treats divine simplicity as explanatorily central rather than merely doctrinal.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Challenges readings that relativize Aquinas to later scholastic innovations (e.g., Suarez), insisting on internal coherence of Thomas rather than syncretistic summaries.
 - Contrasts with Molinist/Molinism: explains Aquinas' handling of foreknowledge and contingency without recourse to middle knowledge.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Applies modern philosophical categories (e.g., grounding, metaphysical dependence) to Thomistic terms (esse, causation), making them usable in contemporary debates.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in analytic theology and in Thomist renewal movements; influential for Protestants and Catholics seeking a philosophically disciplined Thomism.
 - Employed by Reformed scholars both as a critical foil (on predestination/reprobation) and as a resource for refining doctrines of providence and theodicy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a clear, serviceable map of Aquinas for advanced students and scholars; durable as a bridge between historical texts and current philosophical theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Esse / essentia (being / essence)** - Aquinas' core metaphysical distinction; Davies stresses esse as actualizing principle.
- **Act and potency** - Basis for explanation of change, creation, and divine immutability.
- **Divine simplicity** - God's identity with his attributes; crucial for Davies' reading of omniscience and providence.
- **Analogy of being (analogia entis)** - Limits of language about God; avoids univocity and equivocity.
- **Divine foreknowledge** - Timeless, non-temporal knowledge of all events; explained compatibly with creaturely contingency (see Davies on Divine Foreknowledge, Providence and the Problem of Evil).
- **Providence and secondary causality** - God orders ends while permitting genuine secondary causes; solution to the problem of evil via privation and ordering to goods.
- **Privation theory of evil** - Evil as lack, not positive being; moral and natural evils allowed for higher goods.
- **Grace: sufficient vs efficacious** - Distinction central to Aquinas on how grace operates; efficacious grace effects perseverance and predestination.
- **Predestination / election (single predestination)** - God's positive decree to some for glory; reprobation explained as permitted ordering to just punishment (see Davies on Divine Decrees, Election and Reprobation).
- **Certitudo fidei / assurance** - Differentiates certitude of faith (moral/infused) from absolute certitude of knowing one is elect; perseverance depends on continued grace (see Davies on Assurance and Perseverance).
- **Merit: condign and congruent** - Thomistic account of human cooperation with grace in moral reward.
- **Antecedent vs consequent will** - Helps explain God's universal salvific will vs particular efficacious decrees.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a definitional and interpretive source for Aquinas' metaphysics and doctrine of God.
 - As a polemical resource in debates about foreknowledge, providence and theodicy (countering Molinist and some Reformed positions).
 - As an exegetical-model for reading Scholastic texts in contemporary analytic categories and as a conceptual pivot in discussions of grace, election and assurance.
