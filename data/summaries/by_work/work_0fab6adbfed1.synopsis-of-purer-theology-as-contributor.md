### TITLE
Synopsis of Purer Theology (contributors: Francis Turretin et al.)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 17th century Geneva, high point of Reformed scholasticism. Turretin compiles a systematic, compact syllabus for the Genevan Academy aimed at defending confessional Calvinism against Arminianism, Socinianism, Amyraldianism and Cartesian revisions.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - To articulate and defend a precise, confessional Reformed system ("purer theology") by rigorous loci-method exposition that secures the doctrines of Scripture and the confessions against contemporary heterodoxy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Organized by loci (thematic heads): Scripture; God and his attributes; creation; providence; law; sin; Christ; redemption; sacraments; church; last things.
 - Method: short theses, objections drawn from opponents, scriptural and patristic proofs, scholastic distinctions, practical consequences.
 - Emphasis on the coherence of federal (covenantal) theology and the forensic structure of redemption (imputation, justification).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: Arminians, Socinians, Amyraldians (hypothetical universalists), Roman Catholic scholastics, Cartesian philosophers.
 - Resources: Scripture, early church fathers, Calvin, Beza, Reformed confessions (implicitly and explicitly), scholastic manuals.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; divine attributes (absolute and relative); Trinity; creation; original sin (nature and imputation); covenant theology (Covenant of Works and Covenant of Grace); Christology and atonement; justification; sacraments as means/signs and seals of grace; ecclesiology; eschatology.
- **Site usage: five topical references in the Synopsis**
 - **Sacraments As Means Of Grace** - treatment of sacraments as instrumental signs and seals (efficacy tied to Word and Spirit).
 - **Nature And Origin Of Sin** - analysis of original sin (corruption of nature, inherited guilt, federal imputation).
 - **Covenant Of Works** - defense of a prelapsarian covenant requiring perfect obedience as ground of life.
 - **Absolute And Relative Attributes** - systematic distinctions between God's incommunicable/comunicable and absolute vs relative perfections.
 - **Confessional Formulations Of Covenant** - exegesis and harmonization with Reformed confessions (Westminster/Helvetic/Belgic patterns).
- **Closing line**
 - A disciplined, confessional scholastic synthesis that makes federal theology, forensic soteriology, and sacramental instrumentality the organizing center of orthodox Reformed doctrine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Combines compact pedagogical clarity with rigorous polemical anatomy; the covenantal framework is the organizing telos.
 - Strong insistence on forensic categories (imputation, covenant stipulation) as primary theological operators.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Opposes Amyrautian hypothetical universalism by defending particular atonement and the integrity of covenant promises.
 - Rejects Socinian denial of original depravity and Cartesian tendencies that subordinate revelation to speculative reason.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Methodical use of loci-summaries with formal objections and answers makes it a durable classroom and polemical model.
 - Precise deployment of "absolute" vs "relative" attributes to navigate between divine immutability/unity and relational divine action.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in the 18th-19th century Reformed academies (notably Princeton), a standard reference for conservative Reformed orthodoxy.
 - Used by later confessionalists to resist liberalizing trends and to train pastors in scholastic precision.
- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a concise, testable compendium of classical Reformed positions; valuable for teaching covenant theology, sacramental doctrine, and historical polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Loci method** - topical arrangement: thesis, objections, scriptural proofs; pedagogical and polemical tool.
- **Covenant of Works** - pre-fall covenant requiring perfect obedience for life; functional as legal-stipulative ground in federal scheme.
- **Covenant of Grace** - successive administrations of redemption; Christ as federal mediator and head.
- **Original sin** - corruption of nature (depravity) and imputed guilt; origin traced to Adam's federal headship.
- **Imputation** - forensic transfer: Adam's guilt to posterity (and Christ's righteousness to believers).
- **Sacraments: sign, seal, means** - sacraments are external signs and seals that, instrumentally and by the Word and Spirit, convey promised grace (not mere symbols nor independent channels).
- **Absolute attributes** - perfections considered in God's relation to himself (e.g., aseity, simplicity, immutability).
- **Relative attributes** - perfections considered in God's relation to creatures (e.g., mercy, justice, wisdom as exercised toward the world).
- **Forensic language** - emphasis on legal categories (condemnation, justification, imputation).
- **Amyraldianism / Hypothetical universalism** - identified and refuted as inconsistent with particular redemption and covenantal promises.
- **Confessional harmonization** - uses and defends formulations consonant with Westminster, Belgic, and Helvetic confessions.
- **Scholastic precision** - technical distinctions employed for clarity in disputation and catechesis.

How this work is used across loci:
- **Definition source** - go-to concise formulations for doctrines (original sin, covenant, sacraments).
- **Polemic manual** - systematic refutation of Arminian, Socinian, and Amyraldian positions.
- **Exegetical-model** - pattern of argumentation (thesis/objection/proof) applied to biblical texts and doctrinal loci.
- **Conceptual pivot** - foundational resource for teaching Reformed federal theology and sacramental theology in confessional contexts.
