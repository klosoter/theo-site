### TITLE
**Redeeming Science: A God-Centered Approach to the Sciences** (2006), Vern S. Poythress

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 2000s evangelical-Reformed milieu; post-Kuhn philosophy of science; Intelligent Design debates ascendant; ongoing evangelical disputes over Genesis, inerrancy, and evolution.
 - Builds on Van Til and Frame; engages analytic philosophy of science and history of physics.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Science is a human vocation under the lordship of Christ. The very possibility, methods, and aims of science depend on God's triune speech, providence, and covenant faithfulness; sin distorts scientific knowing, and redemption in Christ reorients it.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Worldview foundations**: Scripture's supremacy and the tri-perspectival framework for knowledge.
 - **Metaphysics of creation**: Laws of nature as God's regular personal governance; unity and diversity grounded in the Trinity.
 - **Epistemology of science**: Theory-ladenness, models, and idealization assessed within a covenantal realism; critique of neutrality and methodological naturalism.
 - **Hermeneutics and Genesis**: Scripture governs, with measured discussion of genre, accommodation, and the days of Genesis; multiple faithful readings considered within doctrinal boundaries.
 - **Case studies**: Mathematics and physics as reflections of divine rationality; biology and origins debates; providence and chance; miracles and uniformity.
 - **Redemption of science**: The noetic effects of sin and sanctification of scientific practice; science in the new creation.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Reformed: Van Til, John Frame; Kuyperian streams; interaction with Dooyeweerd.
 - Philosophy of science: Kuhn, Popper, Lakatos, Polanyi, van Fraassen.
 - Science and ID: Newton, Einstein; Behe, Dembski; dialogue with young-earth and theistic evolution positions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and inerrancy; creation ex nihilo; providence and miracle; Trinity and the one-and-many; imago Dei and vocation; sin's noetic effects; Christ as Logos; eschatological hope for cultural labors.
- **Closing line**
 - The laws, logic, and limits of science are best understood as dimensions of God's covenantal speech, redeemed and redirected under Christ's lordship.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Tri-perspectival account of scientific knowledge uniting norms, world, and knower.
 - Laws of nature recast as personal, covenantal regularities of divine speech.
 - Integration of mathematics, language, and physics as reflections of the Trinity's one-and-many.
 - Redeemed practice of science as Christian vocation within the cultural mandate.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against Enlightenment neutrality and NOMA-style compartmentalization; Scripture normatively governs scientific theorizing.
 - Critical of methodological naturalism as a universal rule; allows empirical rigor without metaphysical or methodological atheism.
 - Appreciates but qualifies Intelligent Design; ultimate grounding is revelational, not probabilistic inference alone.
 - Challenges overconfident harmonizations by both young-earth scientism and theistic evolution that flatten biblical authority or scientific humility.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Covenantal laws; tri-perspectival method in science; Word-world correspondence; chance within providence; analogical description in Genesis.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely used in Reformed seminaries for worldview, apologetics, and doctrine of creation; cross-referenced in discussions of bibliology and providence; dialogued with ID proponents and Christian philosophers of science.
- **Enduring value**
 - A coherent template for integrating exegesis, doctrine, and scientific practice; equips pastors and scholars to assess science without ceding theological first principles.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Lordship of Christ over science**: Christ's authority, control, and presence regulate scientific aims and ethics.
- **Tri-perspectivalism**: Normative (God's word), situational (world), and existential (knower) perspectives mutually implicate scientific knowledge.
- **Covenantal laws of nature**: Regularities are personal expressions of God's faithful governance, not impersonal necessities.
- **Word-world correspondence**: Creation ordered by divine speech; mathematics and physical law mirror the rationality of the Logos.
- **Noetic effects of sin**: Cognitive and moral distortion affects hypotheses, interpretation, and scientific communities.
- **Methodological naturalism critique**: Denies its universality; endorses disciplined inquiry open to divine action and design without excluding God a priori.
- **Chance within providence**: Apparent randomness operates under God's meticulous sovereignty.
- **One-and-many**: Trinitarian grounding for unity of laws and diversity of phenomena; supports model pluralism without relativism.
- **Models and idealization**: Scientific models are analogical, partial, and disciplined by Scripture-informed metaphysics.
- **Miracle and uniformity**: Uniformities are God's customs, not chains; miracles are coherent acts of the same Lord.
- **Imago Dei and scientific vocation**: Human creativity and rule reflect God, legitimating science as service and worship.
- **Accommodation and genre**: Scripture's true, fitting communication uses ordinary language; hermeneutics precedes harmonization.
- **Genesis days, analogical framing**: Allows faithful readings that uphold history and theology while acknowledging literary features.
- **Two-books metaphor, ordered**: Nature speaks truly as creation; Scripture normatively interprets it.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definition source for creation, providence, and laws of nature.
 - As a polemic against naturalism and epistemic neutrality.
 - As an exegetical-hermeneutical model for Genesis and miracle.
 - As a conceptual pivot integrating Trinity, revelation, and scientific methodology.
