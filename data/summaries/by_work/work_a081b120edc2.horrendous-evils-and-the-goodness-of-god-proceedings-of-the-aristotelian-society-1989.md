### TITLE
Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God (Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1989) - Marilyn McCord Adams

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 1989 in the Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society amid late-20th-century analytic philosophy of religion.
 - Moves the problem of evil discussion from abstract, evidential disputes into the lived, moral-existential domain (Holocaust, child abuse, atrocity as motivating cases).
 - Situated at the intersection of analytic theodicy, Christian systematic theology, and pastoral concerns.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Traditional theodicies that explain evil as instrumentally necessary for greater goods often fail to address **horrendous evils** - those that threaten to make a person's life as a whole not worth living.
 - For the goodness of God to be credible against such evils, God must be able to **defeat** the horrendousness - i.e., secure a good for the person such that they can reasonably affirm their life (including the evil) as ultimately meaningful or redeemed.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define and illustrate **horrendous evil**: evils that are subjectively and objectively so devastating they undercut the value of life-as-a-whole.
 - Show insufficiency of standard replies:
 - Greater-good justifications can explain instrumental necessity but often leave the victim's subjective despair undefeated.
 - Introduce **defeat** concept: defeat is not mere explanation but a positive good or relational reality that makes the horror intelligible and bearable in a life-assessing way.
 - Argue that only a theistic option where God enters suffering (ultimately a Christological/relational good) plausibly secures such defeat.
 - Conclude that a credible theodicy must address personal identity, value of lives-as-a-whole, and God's capacity to redeem/transform horrendous suffering.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Classical theodicies (Augustinian free-will, Irenaean soul-making) criticized for not addressing subjective defeat.
 - Conversant with analytic literature on evil and justification (broadly: Plantinga-style defenses and evidential problem debates) without being merely technical.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Theodicy and divine goodness; providence; soteriology (implicit Christological emphasis on God's presence and redemption); theological anthropology (what makes life worth living).

- **Closing line capturing theological center**
 - Theodicy must do more than justify God morally; it must show that God can **defeat** horrendous evils by providing a personal, redeeming good that restores the life-as-a-whole to intelligible worth.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves the debate from abstract justificatory probability to the existential quality of victims' lives: the **subjective destructiveness** of certain evils is the central datum requiring theological response.
 - Reframes theodicy as pastoral and relational, not merely argumentative.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts with classical greater-good theodicies by insisting that instrumental explanations can leave victims' lives *undefeated*.
 - Challenges defenses that treat evil solely as a necessary condition for impersonal goods.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Coined and popularized the analytic-theological use of **"horrendous evil"** and the normatively loaded concept of **"defeat"** as a theodical criterion.
 - Introduces "life-as-a-whole" as the relevant evaluative standard for theodical adequacy.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Highly influential in philosophy of religion, spurring a large literature debating whether "defeat" is required and how it might be achieved.
 - Impacted pastoral theology and Holocaust/theology studies; provoked responses from proponents of skeptical theism, soul-making variants, and defenders of impersonal goods.

- **Enduring value**
 - Bridges analytic rigor with pastoral seriousness; supplies a durable conceptual lens for evaluating any theodical proposal against victim-centered criteria.
 - Recommended reading for anyone doing theology of suffering, pastoral care theory, or analytic theodicy.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Horrendous evil**
 - Evils that threaten to render a life-as-a-whole not worth living (subjectively and evaluatively overwhelming).
- **Defeat**
 - The theodical requirement: a positive overcoming of horrendousness so that the victim can reasonably endorse their life-including-the-evil.
- **Life-as-a-whole**
 - Evaluative standard: the worth of a whole life, not merely discrete goods or outcomes.
- **Greater-good theodicy**
 - Traditional move that explains evils as necessary for larger goods; criticized here as frequently insufficient.
- **Subjective vindication**
 - The victim's ability to affirm meaning or worth despite atrocity; central to Adams's criterion.
- **Theodical adequacy**
 - A theodicy's capacity to address both justificatory and existential demands (especially defeat).
- **Relational redemption**
 - God's personal presence/union (Christological implications) as the means to defeat horrendous evils.
- **Pastoral-theological lens**
 - Approach that privileges victims' lived assessments in theological evaluation.
- **Moral ontology of persons**
 - Emphasis on personhood and identity as relevant to whether evils defeat life's worth.
- **Analytic Christian theism**
 - Disciplinary style: analytic clarity applied to Christian doctrinal resources in response to evil.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** and analytic pivot: standard reference for what counts as "horrendous evil" in theodicy debates.
- As a **polemic**: critique of purely instrumental greater-good defenses.
- As a **pastoral-exegetical model**: informs pastoral theology and constructive responses to atrocity.
- As a **conceptual resource**: invites Christological and relational solutions in systematic and philosophical theology.
