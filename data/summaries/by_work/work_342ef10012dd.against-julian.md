### TITLE
Against Julian (Contra Julianum) - Augustine of Hippo (early 5th century)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Augustine composes Contra Julianum in the context of the Pelagian controversy (early 400s), responding to Julian of Eclanum and Pelagius/Cælestius and defending the doctrine of original sin and the necessity of grace within the Latin Western Church.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Julian attacks Augustine's teaching on original sin, grace, and predestination; Augustine replies that human nature is corrupted and guilty through Adam (necessitating divine grace), and that Christ acts as the redeeming head - his human will is not liable to sin.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical rebuttal: careful readings of Pauline texts (esp. Romans and 1 Corinthians) to show corporate solidarity in Adam and in Christ.
 - Anthropological diagnosis: human will and concupiscence are wounded and incapable of saving action apart from grace.
 - Theological construction: defenses of imputation (sin and guilt due to Adam's headship), prevenient/effective grace, election, and the uniqueness of Christ (including his impeccability after the incarnation).
 - Pastoral-legal moves: appeals to baptismal practice (infants), tradition, and the coherence of church teaching.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Julian of Eclanum (primary antagonist), Pelagius and Cælestius (broader Pelagian movement), Pauline corpus, earlier Latin Fathers (implicit and explicit appeals), and theological-philosophical categories drawn from Roman and Christian moral psychology.
- **Doctrines treated:** **Original sin and imputation** (transmission of guilt and corruption), **grace and predestination**, **Christology** (hypostatic union and the **impeccability of Christ** in temptation), and proto-federal language regarding **Christ as covenant head** (headship: "in Adam" / "in Christ").
- **Closing line:** Contra Julianum centers Augustine's claim that human beings are culpably incapacitated by original sin and saved only by divine initiative - Christ, as the saving head, supplies efficacy and righteous standing that human nature, left to itself, cannot produce.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence on **legal imputation**: Adam's sin is transferred to posterity through headship; guilt is real and not merely imitational.
 - Tight coupling of **anthropology and soteriology**: human will's disorder (concupiscence) requires supernatural rectifying grace.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Direct polemic against Pelagian optimism about human nature and Pelagius's denial of inherited guilt.
 - Challenges to any suggestion that grace is merely advisory rather than decisive and effectual.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Persistent use of corporate-headship language ("in Adam," "in Christ") that anticipates later federal formulations.
 - Nuanced account of Christ's human will: tempted but **not liable to sin** after the union - an early articulation of Christ's **impeccability** compatible with genuine temptation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Medieval and Reformation theologians (notably Augustine's doctrine of original sin and predestination) used Contra Julianum as a primary antipelagian resource.
 - Reformed theology reads Augustine as a proto-federal architect - his headship language informs the later **pactum salutis** and representative theories, though Augustine did not systematize a formal "pactum" in scholastic terms.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model of polemical theology that integrates exegesis, pastoral concern, and doctrinal defense.
 - Essential source for debates on **imputation**, the nature of concupiscence, Christ's sinlessness/impeccability, and the foundations of federal-representative salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Original sin:** Humanity's inherited corruption and liability to condemnation originating in Adam; Augustine defends both polluted nature and transmitted guilt.
- **Imputation (of Adam's guilt):** Legal/representative transfer of Adam's culpability to his descendants via headship; not mere imitation but juridical standing.
- **Seminal transmission / concupiscence:** Mechanism Augustine employs to describe how the wound (concupiscence) and corrupted will are passed to posterity.
- **Grace (prevenient and efficacious):** Divine initiation that heals will and effects salvation; Augustine opposes any notion of purely moral example-grace.
- **Predestination/election:** God's gracious choice antecedent to meritorious human action; closely tied to Augustine's anti-Pelagian argument.
- **Impeccability of Christ:** Augustine's claim that Christ's human will, united to the Word, could be tempted yet not sin - maintaining authentic humanity without susceptibility to fault.
- **Hypostatic union:** Framework Augustine uses to explain why Christ's humanity is incapable of moral failure post-union with the Word.
- **Representative head / caput:** The "in Adam" / "in Christ" motif - Christ functions as the federal head whose status is reckoned to believers.
- **Corporate solidarity:** Augustinian anthropology of persons as related through heads, foundational for later covenantal thinking.
- **Concupiscence:** Disordered desire; central to Augustine's description of fallen will and moral inability.
- **Guilt vs. penalty distinction:** Augustine often distinguishes inherited guilt (status) from the individual acts and penalties that flow from it.
- **Scriptural exegesis (Pauline center):** Romans and 1 Corinthians readings are decisive for Augustine's case against Pelagian readings.
- **Pastoral-baptismal argument:** Use of infant baptism practice to argue for early ecclesial recognition of original guilt and need for grace.
- **Proto-pactum language:** While not scholastically formulated, Augustine's language of headship and election function as a conceptual ancestor to later **pactum salutis** descriptions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Augustinian doctrines of original sin and imputation.
 - As a **polemic model** against Pelagianism and Semi-Pelagianism in historical and systematic theology.
 - As an **exegetical and conceptual pivot** for discussions of Christ's headship, imputed righteousness, and the theological roots of later covenantal (pactum) formulations.
