### TITLE
Eschatology and Anthropology: Observations on Some Recent Studies - Richard B. Gaffin Jr. (WTJ)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed scholarship, published in the Westminster Theological Journal amid renewed interest in Pauline eschatology and the "already/not-yet" motif.
 - Part of a wider corrective movement within conservative evangelicalism against both classical dualism and over-realized eschatologies influenced by existentialist or liberal trends.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Theologically responsible anthropology must be shaped by biblical eschatology: who we are (ontology) is determined by who we will be in the eschaton (resurrection and consummation). Misreads of either eschatology or anthropology produce distortions in the other.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: recent studies either minimize the future bodily resurrection in favor of an immediate, purely spiritualized existence, or collapse future consummation into present ethical experience.
 - Exegesis: close attention to Pauline texts (notably 1 Corinthians 15; Romans 8) that link bodily resurrection, the renewal of creation, and personal identity.
 - Theological synthesis: advocate for an **inaugurated eschatology** that preserves a principled continuity and discontinuity between present embodied existence and future redeemed embodiment.
 - Practical implication: Christian life and sanctification are lived in the tension of this already/not-yet - ethical and pastoral ministries must keep the future bodily hope central.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Engages contemporary exegetes and theologians who have reinterpreted Pauline anthropology (broadly construed), and implicitly dialogues with both classical Reformed figures and modern critics of bodily resurrection.
 - Draws on biblical texts, Reformed systematic categories (covenant, union with Christ), and patristic/medieval precedents on resurrection.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Eschatology (inauguration, consummation), anthropology (body-soul relation, personal identity), Christology (union with Christ as basis for resurrection), soteriology (new creation), and the doctrine of the imago Dei as ultimately eschatological.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: **human identity and destiny are eschatologically determined - the hope of bodily resurrection gives the decisive shape to biblical anthropology and guards both spiritualism and premature realization of the eschaton.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes eschatological future (resurrection/consummation) as the decisive hermeneutical key for understanding human nature.
 - Balances continuity (identity, personhood) with discontinuity (transformation, incorruptibility) in a way that preserves bodily reality without collapsing it into mere biology.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects spiritualizing tendencies that downplay bodily resurrection and corporeal continuity.
 - Counters over-realized eschatologies that effectively make present sanctification an eschatological replacement, thereby diminishing future consummation.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Strong reinforcement of "eschatological anthropology" as a deliberate category - not merely anthropology informed by ethics, but anthropology refigured by future consummation.
 - Rearticulates Pauline categories (e.g., "mortal/immortal body") as ontological not merely moral terms.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a corrective to reductionist anthropologies.
 - Influential among those developing a robust doctrine of resurrection and in debates on the practical implications of inaugurated eschatology for sanctification and ministry.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a clear, theologico-exegetical framework for linking soteriology and anthropology; valuable for pastors, biblical theologians, and systematicians teaching on hope, resurrection, and human nature.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Eschatological anthropology**
 - Definition: anthropology whose primary interpretive horizon is the consummation (resurrection/new creation).
- **Inaugurated eschatology**
 - Present kingdom realities that anticipate but do not exhaust the future consummation.
- **Already/not-yet**
 - Tension model explaining present participation in Christ and future fulfillment in resurrection.
- **Continuity and discontinuity**
 - Continuity: personal identity and bodily relation preserved; Discontinuity: transformation, incorruptibility, new order.
- **Bodily resurrection / corporeal continuity**
 - Emphasized as constitutive of true human destiny, not optional or purely symbolic.
- **Mortal/immortal body**
 - Pauline categories read ontologically: present mortality transformed into eschatological immortality.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Soteriological locus by which believers participate in Christ's resurrection and future embodied life.
- **Imago Dei (eschatological reading)**
 - The image of God finds its full realization in redeemed, bodily persons in the new creation.
- **Personal identity**
 - Preserved through resurrection - continuity of self amid radical transformation.
- **Sanctification as eschatological ethic**
 - Present holiness is lived in light of future bodily hope; ethical life is not the replacement of eschatological fulfillment.
- **New creation**
 - Cosmic and human renewal; human destiny is inseparable from the redemption of creation.
- **Use across loci**
 - As a **definition source** for eschatologically grounded anthropology in Reformed systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** against spiritualist and over-realized readings of Pauline texts.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading 1 Corinthians 15 and Romans 8 that ties resurrection, union with Christ, and human identity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** linking soteriology, anthropology, and ecclesial practice (hope-shaped ethics and pastoral care).
