### TITLE
Expositions on the Psalms - Augustine (Enarrationes in Psalmos)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Composed across late 4th / early 5th century (c. 391-426 AD) within the Western Latin Church; Augustine wrote while bishop of Hippo. The work belongs to the late antique exegetical tradition and addresses liturgical, pastoral, and doctrinal needs of a growing Christian community.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Psalter is Christocentric and serves as a primary locus for Christian meditation: the Psalms speak bodily to Christ, the Church, and the soul; they train believers in prayer, ethics, and correct eschatological hope.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Systematic verse-by-verse exegesis of many psalms with recurrent moves:
 - literal-historical reading (occasion/author) → spiritual/allegorical sense → Christological fulfillment → pastoral application.
 - Recurring emphasis on unity of Scripture: Psalms both anticipate and interpret the Gospel.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on and dialogizes with earlier interpreters (notably Origen's allegorical method, Ambrose's homiletic readings, and Hebrew-Christian typology); implicitly counters literalist or exclusively historical readings current in some contemporaries.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (psalms as prophetic speech of Christ), Trinitarian implications (prayer language directed to God who is Father, Son, Spirit), ecclesiology (the Church as psalmic community), soteriology (praise, repentance), eschatology (judgment, resurrection, kingdom), moral formation (interiority and conversion).
- **Eschatological loci - targeted usages**
 - **Christ's Messianic Consciousness and Kingdom:** Psalms read as Christ's voice and royal-sonship language; Augustine interprets royal psalms as pointing to the messianic reign now present in the Church and consummated at the Parousia.
 - **Final Judgment and Eternal States:** Psalms' imagery of reward, retribution, and eternal life are treated theologically as promises of the resurrection and final judgment shaping Christian hope.
 - **Antichrist and Man of Lawlessness:** Psalms that speak of persecutors and wicked nations are allegorically applied to end-time lawlessness and the figure(s) of Antichrist; Augustine integrates these readings with his broader eschatological schema.
 - **Delay of the Parousia:** Augustine uses psalmic texts to pastorally explain the delay of Christ's coming (discipline, church formation, divine patience) while insisting on certainty of fulfillment.
 - **Millennial Views:** Interprets "kingdom" language spiritually rather than as a future carnal thousand-year reign; Psalms support a present-but-not-yet kingdom theology consistent with what later becomes Augustinian amillennialism.
- **Closing line**
 - Augustine's Expositions make the Psalter the Church's handbook for Christ‑centred prayer, moral formation, and soberly hopeful eschatology.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Persistent claim that the Psalms are frequently the voice of Christ himself and must be read through a Christological lens.
 - Integration of pastoral therapy and mystical ascent: psalm-singing is both doctrinal formation and soul-care.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Counterbalances overly literal or purely historical readings by recovering spiritual/typological senses; differs from Origen only in pastoral restraint and Western theological priorities.
 - Moves against millenarian literalism by giving kingdom language a spiritualized, ecclesial interpretation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Refines a multi‑tiered exegesis (literal → spiritual → christological → moral), modeled later in medieval and Reformation hermeneutics.
 - Operationalizes the Psalter as a sustained witness to the "already" of Christ's reign and the "not yet" of consummation.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Deeply influential in medieval monastic exegesis and liturgy; informed Augustine's later systematic works (e.g., City of God) and shaped Western patristic readings.
 - Reformed and Protestant traditions inherited Augustine's Christocentric reading of the Psalms even when diverging on sacramental or ecclesial implications.
- **Enduring value**
 - Exemplary model for combining rigorous exegesis, doctrinal coherence, and pastoral application; indispensable for studies in patristic Christology, Psalm interpretation, and historical eschatologies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Christ as speaker of the Psalms** - Augustine's default interpretive stance: many psalm texts are read as uttered by Christ.
- **Spiritual/allegorical sense** - Scripture's deeper meaning that informs faith and conduct beyond literal history.
- **Typology** - Events and persons in the Old Testament prefigure Christ and the Church; Augustine uses this as a hermeneutical key.
- **Kingdom (regnum)** - Predominantly spiritual and ecclesial in Augustine: present in the Church, consummated at the Parousia.
- **Parousia (Second Coming)** - Certain and imminent in outcome but often delayed for divine reasons; Psalms instruct patience and vigilance.
- **Final Judgment (iudicium finale)** - Psalms' imagery of reward and punishment interpreted as teaching on resurrection and eternal states.
- **Antichrist / man of lawlessness** - Read typologically in persecuting and lawless figures described in Psalm language; part of Augustine's broader end‑time schema.
- **Delay of the Parousia** - Explained pastorally: divine forbearance, opportunity for repentance, and church formation; psalmic lament and hope frame this reality.
- **Millennial language** - Augustine reframes millennium motifs spiritually rather than literal chronological expectations.
- **Praise (laus) and penitence (paenitentia)** - Two dominant pastoral movements derived from the Psalms shaping soteriological life.
- **Ecclesial reading** - The Psalter as the Church's voice; corporate application prioritized.
- **Eschatological already/not‑yet** - Implicit in Augustine's treatment of kingdom and judgment.
- **Exegetical method** - Layered: literal → allegorical → moral; serves as a template for subsequent interpreters.
- **Pastoral hermeneutic** - Exegesis aimed at formation and consolation, not abstract speculation.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Christocentric Psalm interpretation and the spiritual sense of Scripture.
 - As a **polemic resource** against literalist millenarianism and simplistic expectations about Antichrist/the Parousia.
 - As an **exegetical model** for layered readings employed by medieval and Reformation theologians.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for linking liturgy, ethics, and eschatology around the Psalter.
