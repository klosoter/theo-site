### TITLE
The Westminster Assembly: Reading Its Theology in Historical Context - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-17th century English and Scottish context: the Westminster Assembly (1643-1653) amid Civil War, Puritan reform, and Reformed scholastic influence.
 - Theological milieu: Reformed covenant theology informed by Calvin, Bucer, and post-Reformation scholastic categories; contested by Laudian Anglicanism, Arminian and Socinian critiques.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster theology must be read in its historical, confessional, and pastoral context; central to its doctrinal system is the **Spirit-wrought union with Christ**, which integrates justification, sanctification, adoption, sacraments, and ecclesial life.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Letham reconstructs Westminster theology by tracing how Assembly divines reasoned from Scripture through covenantal categories to concrete doctrines.
 - Major moves:
 - Recover the Assembly's **pneumatology** as active and central rather than marginal.
 - Show how **union with Christ** functions as the nexus between forensic (justification) and transformative (sanctification/adoption) aspects.
 - Situate sacramental theology (baptism, Lord's Supper) as **means and seals** by which the Spirit confirms and applies union.
 - Demonstrate continuity with Reformed orthodoxy while noting distinctive emphases of the Assembly.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Principal divines: Thomas Goodwin, John Owen, John Owen-like pneumatological emphases; committee minutes and confessional texts (Westminster Confession, Larger and Shorter Catechisms).
 - Interlocutors: Calvin and Reformation predecessors, continental scholastics, English Laudians/Anglicans, Socinians/Arminians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Pneumatology**, **union with Christ**, **covenant theology**, **justification (forensic imputation)**, **sanctification**, **sacramental theology**, **ecclesiology**, **adoption**, **effectual calling**, and **mediation of Christ**.
- **Closing line**
 - The Westminster Assembly frames Christian identity and ministry around a Spirit-established, covenantal union with Christ that makes justification and sanctification two inseparable aspects of a single redemptive reality.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Reclaims the **Spirit as primary agent** in applying redemption: not an auxiliary but the executive of union with Christ and of ongoing sanctification.
 - Presents union with Christ as **both forensic and organic** - legal standing (imputation) united to vital communion (indwelling, participation).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Pushes back against readings that reduce Westminster to mere forensicism; insists the Assembly maintained robust transformative theology.
 - Contrasts with Roman Catholic notions of infused righteousness by emphasizing **imputation + Spirit-wrought transformation** rather than sacramental infusion alone.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Systematically uses covenantal language to articulate how union functions as the **nexus concept** (connector of doctrinal loci).
 - Clarifies distinctions: **instrumental vs. efficient** roles of Word and sacrament, and **legal vs. vital** aspects of grace.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in modern Reformed scholarship for re-emphasizing pneumatology and sacramental application in Westminster studies.
 - Widely adopted in seminary curricula as a corrective to caricatures of Puritan/Westminster theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching**
 - Provides a balanced, historically grounded reading that informs theological synthesis, preaching, and sacramental praxis around the theme of Spirit-initiated union.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Union with Christ** - central relational reality by which believers are legally in Christ and vitally partake of his life; the primary means the Spirit effectually applies benefits.
 - Legal (imputation) and organic (indwelling/participation) dimensions both affirmed.
- **Spirit / Pneumatology** - the personal agent effecting union, sealing believers, producing sanctification and assurance.
- **Covenant of Grace** - the structural framework; union is realized within covenantal promises and obligations.
- **Justification (imputation)** - forensic declaration grounded in Christ's merit, applied through union but distinct from sanctification.
- **Sanctification** - progressive transformation resulting from the Spirit's indwelling presence in union with Christ.
- **Sacraments as means and seals** - baptism and the Lord's Supper signify and confirm union; the Spirit uses them instrumentally.
- **Effectual calling** - the Spirit's internal call that unites elect to Christ, distinguishing mere external proclamation from saving application.
- **Adoption** - relational consequence of union; believers receive filial status and the Spirit's testimony.
- **Mediation of Christ** - Christ as head and mediator: his life and death operative for members by virtue of union.
- **Imputation vs. Infusion** - Westminster affirms imputation of righteousness while allowing for Spirit-wrought inward renewal, not sacramental infusion as in Roman theology.
- **Ecclesial union / Communion of saints** - corporate dimension of union; church as the body where union is expressed and nurtured.
- **Sealing / Assurance** - Spirit's witness to union, providing assurance through inward testimony and sacramental confirmation.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for Westminster pneumatology and the theology of union - clarifies primary texts and intent.
- As a **polemic and corrective** against reductionist forensic readings that neglect sanctification and the Spirit.
- As an **exegetical-historical model** for reading confessional documents within their theological and pastoral contexts.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking covenant, sacraments, and soteriology around the doctrine of Spirit-mediated union.
