### TITLE
Prayer: Rebelling Against the Status Quo - David F. Wells

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century evangelical and Reformed milieu; written as part of Wells's ongoing critique of contemporary evangelicalism's theological thinness and cultural accommodation.
 - Addresses trends: privatized spirituality, consumerist church practice, therapeutic religion, and certain strains of charismatic and pragmatic prayer culture.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Prayer, rightly understood, is an intentional act of theological rebellion: it resists the reigning cultural and ecclesial **status quo** by affirming God's sovereign lordship, confronting idols, and demanding corporate as well as personal transformation.
 - The problem: contemporary forms of prayer are often reduced to psychological consolation, techniques, or measurable outcomes, severed from doctrine, Scripture, and the church.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic phase: documents how cultural forces (consumerism, individualism, pragmatism) have reshaped prayer into private therapy or technique.
 - Theological re-grounding: reconstructs prayer within biblical categories - sovereignty, providence, covenant, lament, intercession - and insists on doctrinal formation as prerequisite for authentic prayer.
 - Ecclesial and pastoral implications: calls for liturgical, corporate, confessional practices that cultivate a praying church; critiques privatized "success-oriented" models.
 - Practical contours: emphasizes lament, repentance, perseverance, intercession, and dependence on Scripture as distinctives of rebellious prayer.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages broadly with historical streams of Protestant piety (Reformed confessions, Puritanism, pietism) and with contemporary evangelical practice; contrasts biblical patterns of prayer with modern adaptations.
 - Implicitly dialogues with sociological critiques of religion and with pastoral literature on prayer and spirituality.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Providence and sovereignty** (God as Lord over history and particular lives)
 - **Sin and idolatry** (what prayer must confront)
 - **Ecclesiology** (corporate vs. private prayer)
 - **Sanctification** and spiritual formation (prayer as formative discipline)
 - **Scripture and revelation** (prayer grounded in God's revealed will)
 - Secondary implications for soteriology and eschatology in how prayer enacts dependence on divine promises.

- **Closing line**
 - Prayer is not pious accessory but a doctrinal, communal, and subversive praxis: to pray faithfully is to rebel against the church's and culture's capitulation to the gods of self-sufficiency and immediacy.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats prayer explicitly as an act of resistance - theological and ecclesial - rather than mere devotion or technique.
 - Stresses the *corporate* and confessional character of prayer over privatized or purely experiential forms.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges therapeutic and pragmatic models that prioritize results, techniques, or individual feeling.
 - Recovers historical Reformed/Puritan emphases on doctrinally informed, Scripture-saturated prayer while critiquing pietistic privatization.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The framing of prayer as "rebellion" against the status quo shifts the category from passive worship to active protest rooted in theology.
 - Recasts common prayer terms (petition, intercession, lament) as modes of ecclesial critique and formation, not just individual spiritual acts.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Resonated in conservative Reformed and evangelical pastoral circles concerned with spiritual depth and doctrinal fidelity.
 - Used as a corrective resource in seminaries and churches seeking to re-shape worship and discipleship away from consumerist patterns.
 - Critiques: some have accused Wells of downplaying charismatic vitality or practical diversity in prayer practices.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provocative synthesis linking doctrine and prayer; durable as a pastoral-theological corrective.
 - Useful for forming curricula on spiritual formation, liturgy, and pastoral theology that resist privatization and pragmatism.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Rebellion** - Prayer as active resistance to cultural and ecclesial compromise.
- **Status quo** - The prevailing consumerist, therapeutic, and privatized religious culture that dilutes prayer.
- **Sovereignty (of God)** - The theological ground for petition and trust; prayer acknowledges God's lordship over events.
- **Providence** - Prayer engages God's purposive governance, not random chance or merely human agency.
- **Intercession** - Church-centered pleading that expresses communal dependence and responsibility.
- **Lament** - A central biblical form; names suffering and petition as faithful, public speech before God.
- **Corporate prayer** - Emphasized over privatized prayer; formation happens in the gathered body.
- **Confession / confessionality** - Prayer embedded in confession of sin and doctrinal truth; resists superficial piety.
- **Idolatry** - That which prayer must unmask: self-sufficiency, therapeutic idols, and cultural gods.
- **Sanctification (formation)** - Prayer as primary means of ongoing spiritual formation shaped by doctrine.
- **Scriptural prayer** - Prayer that is guided and informed by the language, promises, and categories of Scripture.
- **Pragmatism (critique)** - The reduction of prayer to success metrics or techniques.
- **Pietism (diagnosis)** - Historical root for privatized devotion that Wells critiques when divorced from doctrine.
- **Liturgical practice** - The corporate forms and rhythms that sustain rebellious, doctrinal prayer.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: reframes prayer as ecclesial and resistant practice, not merely private devotion.
 - As a **polemic**: critiques therapeutic, consumerist, or purely pragmatic models of prayer prevalent in modern evangelicalism.
 - As a **practical-exegetical model**: informs pastoral formation, liturgical reform, and curricula that aim to make prayer doctrinally grounded and communal.
