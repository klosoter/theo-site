### TITLE
**The Epistle to the Romans** (ca. AD 56-58; Corinth/Cenchreae), an apostolic letter to a mixed Jewish-Gentile church in Rome, framing the gospel as Gods righteous power to save, to unite Jew and Gentile, and to form an obedient, Spirit-led people for the nations.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Mid-first century, post-Claudius expulsion, Jewish believers returning to predominantly Gentile house-churches. Phoebe likely carrier (Rom 16.1-2); Tertius amanuensis (16.22).
 - Milieu: Scripture-saturated argument in diatribe style engaging Jewish law-observant and Greco-Roman moralist interlocutors.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - **The righteousness of God** is revealed in the gospel of the crucified and risen Christ, justifying the ungodly by faith, creating a multiethnic covenant family, and fulfilling Gods promises to Israel in an already-not-yet eschatological horizon.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - 1.1-17: Greeting, thesis. Gospel as Gods power; righteousness by faith; obedience of faith among the nations.
 - 1.18-3.20: Universal sin under wrath. Pagan idolatry, moralist hypocrisy, Jewish transgression; law silences all.
 - 3.21-4.25: Justification apart from works of the law. Christ as hilasterion; Abraham and David as witnesses; faith reckoned as righteousness.
 - 5.1-8.39: New realm in Christ and by the Spirit. Adam-Christ typology; baptismal union; sanctification; struggle with sin; Spirit adoption; assurance and unbreakable chain to glory.
 - 9.1-11.36: Israels election and Gods fidelity. Remnant by grace, hardening, Gentile ingrafting, irrevocable gifts, future fullness; doxology.
 - 12.1-15.13: Transformed ethics. Living sacrifice, love fulfills law, political submission, strong and weak, mutual upbuilding.
 - 15.14-16.27: Pauls mission to the nations, Spain plans, greetings, final doxology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy OT use (Genesis, Psalms, Isaiah, Hosea, Deuteronomy). Dialogue with Jewish boasting in Torah, Gentile moralism, and intra-church tensions.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Bibliology** (scripture fulfills and witnesses), **Christology** (Davidic Son, risen Lord), **Soteriology** (justification, redemption, reconciliation, union, adoption, assurance), **Sin** (Adamic headship, power), **Pneumatology** (indwelling, sonship), **Covenant** (promise to Abraham, new-covenant heart), **Eschatology** (already-not-yet, creation groaning, Israel mystery), **Ethics** (love, conscience, state).
- **Closing line**
 - Gods covenant-faithful righteousness creates, by the crucified and risen Christ and the Spirit, a holy, reconciled people whose obedient faith displays his mercy to Israel and the nations.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Righteousness of God** as saving, covenantal, and judicial action.
 - **Faith apart from works of the law** while establishing the law through Christ and love.
 - **Adam-Christ** two-Adam schema grounding both guilt and grace.
 - **Union with Christ** and **Spirit-adoption** as the engine of sanctification and assurance.
 - **Israel-church olive tree** with future hope for Israel.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects legalism and ethnic boundary confidence; rebukes antinomianism by union-with-Christ ethics; relativizes imperial lordship before Jesus as Lord; reframes election as mercy-driven and missional.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Forensic-plus-participatory soteriology; **hilasterion** as mercy-seat Christology; **law of the Spirit of life**; **obedience of faith** as mission aim; retooling of worship as **living sacrifice**.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Pivotal for Augustine (grace vs Pelagius), Luther and Calvin (justification by faith), Reformed federal theology (Adam-Christ), Wesleyan holiness, Barth (Christological rereading), New Perspective and apocalyptic readings (Torah and powers).
- **Enduring value**
 - Canonical template for gospel definition, sin diagnosis, grace remedy, church unity, mission to the nations, and pastoral ethics under eschatological hope.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Righteousness of God (dikaiosyne theou)**: Gods covenantally faithful, saving justice revealed in Christ; both character and action.
 - Debated genitive: righteousness from God vs Gods own righteousness; Romans uses both effects and source.
- **Justification**: Forensic declaration of righteousness by faith in Jesus Christ apart from works; present verdict anticipating final judgment.
- **Faith (pistis)**: Trustful allegiance to Christ; debate over pistis Christou (faith in Christ vs faithfulness of Christ) complements, not cancels, grace.
- **Works of the law**: Deeds prescribed by Torah (including boundary markers); incapable of justifying due to sin and flesh.
- **Law (nomos)**: Mosaic Torah; can name covenant, moral will, or a power; contrasted with the **law of the Spirit of life** fulfilled by love.
