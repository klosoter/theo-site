### TITLE
**Defining Evangelicalism's Boundaries Theologically: Is Open Theism Evangelical? - Bruce A. Ware (Beyond the Bounds, 2003)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in 2003 amid heightened intra-evangelical controversy over open theism (late 1990s-2000s).
 - Situated within a confessional, Reformed-leaning evangelical milieu anxious to maintain doctrinal boundaries against perceived innovations.
 - Responds to promin ent open theists (e.g., Clark Pinnock, John Sanders, Gregory Boyd) and to the broader evangelical identity project.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Ware argues that open theism, properly understood, departs significantly from historic evangelical commitments about God (especially divine knowledge, sovereignty, immutability) and therefore should not be counted as within orthodox evangelicalism.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define evangelical identity theologically (not merely sociologically): core commitments include biblical authority, Trinitarian theism, classical attributes of God, historic Christology and atonement understandings.
 - Expose what open theism claims: a God who does not have exhaustive definite foreknowledge of all future free acts; future partly open; God dynamically responds.
 - Trace theological consequences: erosions of omniscience, divine immutability, providence, and the character of divine promises and prophecy.
 - Test open theism against key biblical texts and evangelical theological commitments (e.g., assurance of prophecy, theology of prayer, gospel efficacy).
 - Compare alternatives within evangelicalism (classical theism, Molinism/middle knowledge, compatibilist providence) and argue they remain consistent with evangelical boundaries.
 - Conclude: open theism represents a substantial departure and should be judged non-evangelical on doctrinal grounds.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary interlocutors: open theists (Pinnock, Sanders, Boyd, Hasker).
 - Comparative interlocutors: Molinists (William Lane Craig, Thomas Flint), classical theists in Reformed and evangelical circles.
 - Uses biblical exegesis, systematic-theological categories, and confessional criteria.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Divine attributes (omniscience, immutability, omnipotence), providence, foreknowledge, human freedom (libertarian vs compatibilist), prophecy, prayer, and assurance.

- **Closing line**
 - Ware locates the theological center of gravity of evangelicalism in a classical, biblically grounded theism that affirms exhaustive divine foreknowledge and sovereign providence; open theism, he contends, falls outside those boundaries.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats evangelical identity primarily as a matter of doctrinal fidelity to classical theism rather than mere Protestant/evangelical markers (e.g., conversionism, activism).
 - Emphasizes ecclesial and pastoral costs of open theism (e.g., confidence in prayer, trust in divine promises).

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Challenges open theists' biblical readings that emphasize divine temporality and responsiveness as corrective but ultimately destructive of traditional doctrines.
 - Offers Molinism and classical compatibilism as theologically safer alternatives within evangelical orthodoxy.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Frames evangelical boundaries as theological gatekeeping based on specific attributes (exhaustive foreknowledge and immutability), sharpening an identity test rather than a sociological label.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among confessional Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a standard critique of open theism.
 - Cited in denominational credentialing debates and in syllabi for systematic theology, apologetics, and polemics.
 - Provoked continued debate; open theists responded emphasizing pastoral and biblical motives for their model.

- **Enduring value**
 - Useful concise statement of why many evangelicals see open theism as theologically problematic.
 - Serves well in teaching boundary issues, the doctrine of God, and pastoral implications tied to divine attributes.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Open Theism**
 - The view that the future contains genuine possibilities not exhaustively known by God; God knows possibilities but not definite future free choices.
- **Classical Theism**
 - Traditional view attributing exhaustive knowledge, immutability, and timelessness/eternal present to God; basis for Ware's evangelical standard.
- **Exhaustive Divine Foreknowledge**
 - The claim that God knows, definitively and infallibly, all future contingent events.
- **Molinism / Middle Knowledge**
 - Explanation of how God's middle knowledge (knowledge of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom) allows God to sovereignly providentially order history while preserving libertarian freedom.
 - Presented as an evangelical-consistent alternative to open theism.
- **Counterfactuals of Creaturely Freedom**
 - Hypothetical truths about what free creatures would do in any given circumstance; central to Molinist reconciliation of freedom and foreknowledge.
- **Divine Sovereignty / Providence**
 - God's comprehensive governance and purposeful ordering of events; Ware argues open theism weakens this doctrine.
- **Divine Immutability**
 - God's unchanging nature; Ware links open theism's dynamic God to threats against immutability.
- **Omniscience**
 - God's all-encompassing knowledge; contested locus between open theists and classical evangelicals.
- **Libertarian Freedom vs Compatibilism**
 - Ware addresses the tension and spotlights Molinism and compatibilist models as evangelical-compatible, contrasting libertarian accounts underpinning open theism.
- **Prophecy & Promise**
 - Ware stresses that biblical prophecy and divine promises presuppose exhaustive foreknowledge and definitive divine will.
- **Prayer & Divine Response**
 - Practical-theological locus: whether prayer changes God (open theism) or changes the human relation to a sovereignly providential God.

- How this work is used:
 - As a definitional source for **evangelical boundaries** on the doctrine of God.
 - As a **polemic** and teaching resource against open theism in systematic theology and pastoral classes.
 - As a conceptual pivot comparing **Molinism (middle knowledge)** and classical views against open theism when adjudicating evangelical orthodoxy.
