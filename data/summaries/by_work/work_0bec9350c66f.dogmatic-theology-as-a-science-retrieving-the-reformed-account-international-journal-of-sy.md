### TITLE
Dogmatic Theology as a Science: Retrieving the Reformed Account - Scott R. Swain (International Journal of Systematic Theology, 2014)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Early 21st-century recovery of Reformed scholastic method within evangelical and confessional Reformed theology.
 - Situated amid debates over theological method: between historicist/scholastic retrieval and modern/postmodern critiques that deny a "scientia" model of theology.
- **Central thesis**
 - Dogmatic theology properly understood is a *scientia* (a disciplined, principled science) when it rests on distinctive Reformed principia (first principles) grounded in the propositional Word of God and the church's rule of faith.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Explicate what "science" meant in the Reformed tradition: ordered, demonstrative/methodical inquiry governed by first principles.
 - Recover the Reformed principial framework (Scripture as norm and principle) that secures theological knowledge while disciplining reason.
 - Distinguish orthodox dogmatics from (a) speculative natural theology and (b) modern reductions that make theology a merely descriptive or cultural discipline.
 - Show continuity with Calvin, Reformed scholastics (e.g., Turretin), and post-scholastic voices (e.g., Bavinck), while rearticulating for contemporary methodological pressures.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positive interlocutors: John Calvin, Reformed scholastics (Turretin), Herman Bavinck, later Reformed methodologists.
 - Critics and contrasts: modern Protestant liberalism, postliberal approaches (e.g., Lindbeckian tendencies), and strains in Barthian rejection of scholastic categories.
 - Contemporary conversation partners: systematic theologians debating the legitimacy and form of theological "science."
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Doctrine of revelation and Scripture (principia).
 - Implications for Trinitarian doctrine, Christology, soteriology (grace), covenant theology, and the church as the context for dogmatic discourse.
 - Epistemological adjuncts: authority, objectivity, and the role of reason under grace.
- **Closing line**
 - Dogmatic theology, rightly constrained by Reformed principia, is a normative, disciplined scientia whose telos is truthful, ordered confession of God for the church's worship and life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Reclaims "scientia" language for theology without collapsing theology into autonomous rationalism: science of theology is Scripture-governed, not secular.
 - Stresses principialism: theology begins and is continuously ordered by divine propositional revelation as the first principle.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects modern dismissals of scholastic-style method as merely archaic or apologetic; argues for retrieval with careful reformulation.
 - Contrasts with postliberal or cultural-linguistic accounts that privatize theology's epistemic grounding; contrasts with liberal descriptive models that detach theology from normative truth-claims.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Re-articulation of classical scholastic categories (principia, scientia) in Reformed idiom, showing they can be theological and confessional rather than purely philosophical.
 - Clarifies the relation of propositional revelation to rational argument: a disciplined use of reason "under" Scripture rather than against it.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential among confessional Reformed scholars seeking methodological recovery; cited in discussions of systematic theology's legitimacy as a disciplined science.
 - Provoked engagement from theologians wary of scholasticism and from those committed to renewing doctrinal method in seminaries and confessional contexts.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, defensible model for teaching dogmatics as disciplined, normative inquiry.
 - Serves as a methodological corrective and rallying-point for renewed confessional theology in academic and church settings.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Scientia** - theology as a disciplined, ordered science; denotes methodical, principled inquiry, not naturalistic scientism.
- **Principia (first principles)** - foundational norms for theology; in Reformed account these are divine propositional revelations (Scripture and rule of faith).
- **Propositional revelation** - the view that revelation is truth-bearing propositions that function as the starting points for theological reasoning.
- **Rule of faith** - ecclesial and confessional standards that regulate theological formulations and guard orthodoxy.
- **Reformed scholasticism** - historical method and vocabulary (e.g., Turretin) retrieved and reformulated for contemporary use.
- **Analogia fidei / coherence under Scripture** - doctrine construction must cohere with the whole counsel of God and Scripture's rule.
- **Theology vs. natural theology** - theology grounded in Scripture is distinct from speculative demonstrations of God from nature.
- **Normative vs. descriptive theology** - emphasis on theology's confessional normative function (what the church should confess) over sociological description.
- **Principialism** - methodological posture insisting on authoritative theological first principles.
- **Reason under grace** - limited but robust role for human reason, functioning subordinately to revealed principles.
- **Loci theologiae** - structural points of doctrinal ordering that systematic dogmatics treats as organized knowledge.
- **Confessional ontology** - the idea that doctrinal claims are embedded in ecclesial confession and worship as formative realities.
- **Epistemic authority** - how theological claims are justified: Scripture-as-principle supplies warrant rather than purely procedural academic norms.
- **Retrieval** - methodological move to bring classical Reformed categories into conversation with contemporary theology.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for courses and syllabi on theological method and for arguing that dogmatics can be systematic/scientific.
- As a **polemic** against reductionist or postliberal approaches that deny theology normative principia.
- As a **conceptual pivot** when constructing confessional systematic theologies that integrate Reformed scholastic resources with modern concerns.
