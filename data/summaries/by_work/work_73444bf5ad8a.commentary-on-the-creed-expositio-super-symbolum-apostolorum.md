### TITLE
Commentary on the Creed (Expositio super Symbolum Apostolorum) - Thomas Aquinas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-13th century Scholastic Dominican milieu; Aquinas as student and master in Paris and Naples. Written as a pastoral-scholastic exposition for teaching and preaching rather than as a disputation treatise.
 - Engages the wider question-laden theology of the era and integrates Aristotelian metaphysics into doctrinal exposition.
 - Site usage note: referenced here for the topics **Filioque** and **Ecumenical Creeds**.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The Apostles' Creed is the compact, authoritative rule of the Christian faith; each clause encapsulates key dogmatic truths that must be explicated by Scripture, Fathers, and right reason.
 - Primary doctrinal tasks: to articulate the Trinity (and the Spirit's procession), the person and work of Christ, sacraments, Church, resurrection, and last judgment within a coherent metaphysical and pastoral framework.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Line-by-line exegesis of the Creed; each phrase receives:
 - Scriptural proof and patristic citation;
 - Philosophical clarification (distinctions of person/nature, order of causality, etc.);
 - Practical implication (piety, sacramental practice, heresy correction).
 - Major moves:
 - Establish the Creed as lex credendi and catechetical summary.
 - Defend orthodox Trinitarian formulae (including the Son's relation to the Father and the Spirit's procession).
 - Explicate Christology by tracing the incarnation, passion, and resurrection clauses into soteriology and sacramental theology.
 - Conclude with eschatological affirmation (resurrection of body; life everlasting) tied to moral accountability and ecclesial sign-structures.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Heavy reliance on Augustine, Gregory, Jerome, Ambrose; engages Peter Lombard and canonical collections; consistent appeal to Scriptural texts.
 - Implicit and explicit correction of contemporary misunderstandings (various heresies, and in the Filioque matter, Eastern objections).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (processions, relations), Christology (hypostatic union, kenosis, atonement), soteriology (merit, satisfaction), sacraments as signs and causes, Church (marks, authority), eschatology (resurrection, judgment).

- **Closing line**
 - Aquinas shapes the Creed into a systematically argued, philosophically disciplined, and pastorally oriented formula: the Apostles' Creed as the compact rule of faith, intelligible by reason and normative for the Church.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Integration of Aristotelian metaphysics for precision in theological terms (essence/accident, act/potency, causal series).
 - Emphasis on the Creed as both doctrinal summary and liturgical-catechetical instrument: theology that serves worship and moral life.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Moves beyond purely patristic exegesis by providing scholastic distinctions (e.g., nature vs. person) to resolve apparent tensions in creedal clauses.
 - Responds to Eastern critiques on the **Filioque** by specifying the manner of the Spirit's procession (from Father through the Son in the economy; eternally from Father and Son in theological formulation).

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Systematic use of causal categories (principium, processio) to articulate intra-Trinitarian relations without compromising monarchy of the Father.
 - Precise use of "procession" and "relation" to distinguish ontological eternal processions from economic missions.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received as a standard medieval Catholic manual for catechesis and doctrine; influential in Catholic seminary curricula.
 - Reformed and Protestant theologians respect its systematic clarity though often diverge on sacramental theology and some metaphysical presumptions.
 - Continues to be a touchstone in ecumenical discussions on the Creeds, especially on the Filioque controversy.

- **Enduring value**
 - Model of how to read creeds: concise, patristically rooted, philosophically informed, and pastorally directed. Essential for Trinitarian and Christological instruction.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Apostles' Creed (Symbolum Apostolorum)** - the text under commentary; treated as compact rule of faith.
- **Filioque** - clause "and the Son"; Aquinas defends its theological articulation while attempting to nuance the eternal vs. economic perspectives.
- **Procession (processio)** - technical term for the eternal origin of the divine persons; distinguished from temporal missions.
- **Person (persona) / Nature (natura)** - crucial scholastic distinction used to preserve unity of God and plurality of Persons.
- **Hypostatic Union** - doctrine of Christ's two natures in one person; Aquinas clarifies operations and appropriations.
- **Merit / Satisfaction** - soteriological categories linking Christ's passion to human justification and sacramental economy.
- **Sacrament (sacramentum)** - sign and instrument of grace; Aquinas ties Creedal affirmations to visible ecclesial rites.
- **Resurrection of the body** - eschatological affirmation connected to creation, redemption, and final justice.
- **Eternal vs. Economic Order** - distinction for intra-Trinitarian relations versus salvific actions in history.
- **Principium / Causa** - causal language to explain relations among divine Persons.
- **Lex credendi** - the Creed as normative rule of belief; anchor for doctrinal formulation.
- **Sensus fidei** - implicit appeal to the Church's collective grasp of truth via the Creed.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source**: authoritative articulation of basic doctrines for Catholic theology and catechesis.
 - As a **polemic tool**: defense of Western positions (notably the Filioque) in East-West debates.
 - As an **exegetical model**: exemplar of line-by-line creed commentary integrating Scripture, Fathers, and philosophical theology.
 - As a **conceptual pivot**: a primary medieval resource for Trinitarian metaphysics and sacramental theology.
