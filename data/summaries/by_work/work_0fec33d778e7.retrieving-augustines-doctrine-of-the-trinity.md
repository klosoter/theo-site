### TITLE
**Retrieving Augustine's Doctrine of the Trinity - Gavin Ortlund (IVP Academic, 2019)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary evangelical retrieval movement (IVP "Retrieving the Tradition" ethos), addressing late 20th-21st century Trinitarian debates (classical vs social Trinitarianism).
 - Author: Gavin Ortlund, evangelical pastor-theologian seeking pastoral and doctrinal recovery of Augustine for modern churches.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Augustine offers a balanced, biblically rooted, pastorally formative account of the Trinity that corrects both modern individualistic readings and social-Trinitarian excesses; his use of psychological analogies must be understood as analogical, not literal identifications.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Survey and exegetical unpacking of Augustine's principal trinitarian texts (De Trinitate, Confessions, sermons).
 - Historical placement: shows Augustine's debt to Scripture and Cappadocians but also his methodological and theological distinctives.
 - Theological rehabilitation: explicates Augustine's account of personhood, relations of origin, procession, and the imago Dei as the key to Christian life.
 - Pastoral application: Augustine's Trinity shapes worship, prayer, sanctification, and the Christian mind.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Augustine (De Trinitate, Confessions, sermonic corpus).
 - Secondary interlocutors: Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa), opponents in contemporary debate (various proponents of social Trinitarianism), and modern evangelical readers.
 - Engages contemporary scholars and popularizers of the social Trinity to show where Augustine corrects or complements them.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (immanent/economic distinction, persons as relations of origin, procession, filioque implications).
 - Imago Dei and anthropological analogies (memory, understanding, will).
 - Revelation and biblical exegesis (John, Pauline strands).
 - Pastoral theology: prayer, worship, sanctification rooted in Trinitarian life.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Augustine furnishes a classical Trinitarianism that is both relational and monarchical in divine unity, offering a pastoral, biblical, and philosophical synthesis urgently needed for contemporary gospel-shaped worship and thought.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Stresses Augustine as a pastoral theologian: doctrine is aimed at sanctified affections and prayerful knowledge of God, not merely metaphysical abstraction.
 - Reclaims Augustine's psychological analogies as corrective analogies that protect divine unity rather than endorse a tri-personal "sociality" of three separate centers.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Challenges modern social-Trinitarian positions that read Augustine as endorsing a three-subject model; insists Augustine grounds personhood in relations of origin, not isolated centers of consciousness.
 - Pushes back on reductive uses of Augustine by both hyper-Western metaphysicians and relativizing modern pluralists.

- **Conceptual / terminological moves**
 - Reframes Augustine's "memory-understanding-will" triad as an imago Dei paradigm for Christian formation rather than a literal psychological proof of three persons.
 - Emphasizes relational ontology rooted in procession and origin rather than existentially individualized persons.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well received in evangelical circles seeking historical retrieval of doctrine; used as a bridge between patristic fidelity and contemporary pastoral concerns.
 - Provokes discussion among social-Trinitarian advocates and patristic scholars about proper linguistic boundaries for "person" and "relation."

- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, readable guide to Augustine's trinitarian method and pastoral implications; valuable for pastors, students, and scholars wanting a usable Augustinianism for worship and discipleship.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Immanent Trinity** - God as God is in himself (relations of origin: begetting and procession).
- **Economic Trinity** - God's actions in history (revelation, redemption, Spirit's work).
- **Relations of origin** - Father as source, Son as begotten, Spirit as procession; personhood defined by relational origin in Augustine.
- **Procession / procession (processio)** - The internal derivation (begetting, spiration) that grounds distinction without division.
- **Ousia / Hypostasis** - Unity of divine essence (ousia) and distinct subsistences/persons (hypostases) as Augustine employs Latinized categories.
- **Psychological analogy (memory, understanding, will)** - Augustine's inner-triad analogy for human image of Trinity; analogical, not identity-based.
 - Emphasis: analogies illuminate connectivity of unity and distinction; avoid literalizing into three minds.
- **Imago Dei** - Human reflection of triune life; basis for ethical and spiritual formation.
- **Perichoresis (mutual indwelling)** - Augustine affirms interpenetration affirming unity and relationality without modalism.
- **Filioque** - Implicitly present in Augustine's formulations on the Spirit's procession from Father and Son; addressed with historical sensitivity.
- **Classical Trinitarianism** - Single divine subject with three persons; Augustine as primary articulator for the West.
- **Social Trinitarianism** - Contemporary model emphasizing distinct centers of personhood; Ortlund critiques its naïve readings of Augustine.
- **Person (persona)** - For Augustine, relational designation tied to origin and procession rather than autonomous individualism.
- **Biblical exegesis (John, Pauline corpus)** - Augustine's scriptural starting point for theological construction; Ortlund follows this method.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a concise historical-theological definition source for Augustinian Trinitarian categories in preaching and doctrine.
 - As a polemical resource countering social-Trinitarian readings in contemporary evangelical theology.
 - As an exegetical-pastoral model: exemplifies how patristic exegesis can form worship, prayer, and spiritual formation.
