### TITLE
A Pauline Take on the New Perspective (Credenda/Agenda) - Douglas Wilson

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published in Credenda/Agenda (late 20th century), a conservative Reformed/neo-Calvinist journal associated with Douglas Wilson and the New Geneva movement.
 - Appears amid intensified debates over the New Perspective on Paul (NPP), and contemporaneous controversies over covenant theology and the emergent Federal Vision discussions.
 - Audience: pastors, Reformed laity, and scholars sympathetic to confessional Protestantism but engaged with recent Pauline scholarship.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Wilson contends that many NPP claims misconstrue Paul by overemphasizing boundary markers and second-temple Judaism's ethnic boundary-maintenance, thereby weakening the classical Protestant doctrine of justification by faith.
 - He seeks a Pauline reading that preserves forensic justification and union with Christ while taking seriously corporate/covenantal dimensions of Paul's thought.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Starts with survey of NPP claims: justification as covenant membership language, works as boundary-keeping rather than meritorious righteousness.
 - Moves to Pauline exegesis: key passages (e.g., Romans, Galatians) re-read to show forensic verdict language and personal imputation remain central.
 - Argues for a synthetic model:
 - **Forensic verdict**: God declares sinners righteous on account of Christ's merit imputed to believers.
 - **Covenantal union**: Justification must also be understood within covenantal incorporation - believers are members of Christ's body; baptism and church life are significant markers.
 - **Anti-legalism**: Opposes legalistic readings but emphasizes that good works remain necessary evidences, not grounds, of justification.
 - Concludes that a properly Pauline theology preserves sola fide while rectifying some oversimplifications in older Protestant polemics and some excesses of the NPP.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Direct interlocutors: proponents of the New Perspective (e.g., E.P. Sanders, James D.G. Dunn, N.T. Wright implicitly as representative).
 - Historical sources: classical Reformers (Paul, Luther, Calvin) used as touchstones for forensic language.
 - Contemporary Reformed debates: Federal Vision advocates and critics are implicitly or explicitly engaged.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Justification** (primary focus): forensic imputation, faith as receiving righteousness, role of works as fruit/evidence.
 - **Covenant**: corporate/covenantal categories emphasized as necessary context for Paul.
 - **Union with Christ**: as complementary to forensic declaration.
 - **Ecclesiology and sacraments**: baptism and church membership as covenantal signs related to Pauline language.
 - Secondary touches: anthropology (sin and faith), soteriology (imputation vs. infusion of righteousness).

- **Closing line**
 - Wilson's theological center of gravity: defend forensic justification by faith as the core Pauline message while integrating covenantal, corporate realities so that sola fide is neither eviscerated nor naïvely individualized.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Emphasizes a disciplined synthesis: retain classical forensic categories but refuse to flatten Paul into purely individualistic or purely communal schemas.
 - Stresses pastoral implications: assurance, church discipline, and sacramental practice must coherently reflect justification doctrine.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects perceived NPP overcorrections that make justification merely an issue of ethnic inclusion or covenant status.
 - Contrasts with some Federal Vision emphases that risk conflating justification and sanctification; Wilson insists on a maintained distinction even while stressing covenant union.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses "forensic-covenantal synthesis" as a working heuristic: two analytic categories held together rather than pitted against one another.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Held traction among conservative Reformed readers who wished to engage NPP without abandoning confessional commitments.
 - Provoked critique from NPP scholars for underestimating their historical claims; provoked caution among Federal Vision critics who saw Wilson as too willing to collapse distinctions.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact model for pastors and teachers wanting a pastoral, confessional response to the NPP that also takes covenantal language seriously.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Justification by faith**
 - Forensic declaration by God, central Pauline doctrine that Wilson defends against reductionist readings.

- **New Perspective on Paul (NPP)**
 - Modern movement reframing Second Temple Judaism and Paul; treated as primary interlocutor.

- **Forensic imputation**
 - Christ's righteousness credited to believers; emphasized as non-negotiable.

- **Covenantal union / corporate election**
 - Paul's corporate language for members in Christ; used to nuance individualistic readings.

- **Works (as evidence vs. grounds)**
 - Distinction stressed: works are necessary fruits and evidences, not meritorious grounds for justification.

- **Sacraments (baptism)**
 - Covenant signs that reflect incorporation into Christ and should be read into Pauline practice.

- **Assurance**
 - Pastoral correlate of justified status; tied to covenantal markers and objective imputation.

- **Forensic-covenantal synthesis**
 - Wilson's heuristic: hold forensic declaration and covenantal incorporation together.

- **Federal Vision (contextual relation)**
 - Debated movement within Reformed circles; Wilson's essay is read as engaging FV anxieties without endorsing conflationist errors.

- **Boundary markers**
 - NPP term for Jewish identity practices; Wilson critiques overemphasis when applied to justification language.

- **Imputation vs. infusion**
 - Reaffirms imputation (Protestant) over infusion (medieval/Roman) while acknowledging sanctifying realities.

- **Pauline exegesis (Romans, Galatians)**
 - Primary loci for Wilson's method and arguments.

- **Legalism / Antinomianism**
 - Poles Wilson seeks to avoid by balancing forensic declaration and covenant ethics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **polemic** against reductive readings of the NPP and against readings of Federal Vision that collapse justification/sanctification.
- As an **exegetical model** for pastors: close reading of Romans/Galatians that preserves forensic language while employing covenantal categories.
- As a **teaching resource** in Reformed contexts to defend sola fide without neglecting ecclesial and sacramental dimensions.
