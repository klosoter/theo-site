### TITLE
The Biblical Doctrine of Salvation - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Product of late 19th / early 20th-century Princeton Calvinist scholarship. Warfield writes within the conservative, confessional Reformed milieu reacting to liberal theology, Ritschlianism, and higher criticism while consolidating post-Reformation scholastic categories with rigorous biblical exegesis.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Salvation is an objective, covenantal work of God accomplished in Christ and applied to sinners by sovereign grace; justification is forensic imputation, not a transformation that constitutes initial acceptance before God.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Clarifies biblical categories (guilt, pollution, death) to ground the need for penal substitution.
 - Defines the covenantal framework: federal headship (Adam/Christ) and the continuity of covenantal order (covenant of works vs covenant of grace).
 - Explicates Christology for soteriology: Christ's active and passive obedience as meritorious grounds for justification.
 - Distinguishes the objective work of redemption (historia salutis) from the subjective application (ordo salutis), insisting the former is prior and determinative.
 - Articulates the mechanics of justification: forensic declaration, imputation of Christ's righteousness, faith as instrumental (not meritorious).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages Scripture centrally (especially Pauline epistles), the Reformers (Calvin), Augustine, Princeton predecessors (Hodge), and contemporary opponents in liberal theology and moralistic interpretations of atonement.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation (Scripture authority), sin (total depravity; guilt and pollution), covenant theology (covenant of works and grace), Christology (vicarious obedience), atonement (penal substitution), justification (forensic/imputation), faith and repentance, sanctification, assurance.
- **Closing line**
 - Warfield's work centers Reformed soteriology on an objective, forensic, covenantal accomplishment in Christ that is mysteriously effectuated by sovereign grace in the believer.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence on the forensic/legal vocabulary of justification: declaration and imputation are central, not merely moral renewal.
 - Clear separation and ordering of historia salutis (what Christ has done objectively) and ordo salutis (application in the believer), with the former given theological priority.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects pietistic or ethical reductions of salvation that make justification dependent on subjective morality or religious experience.
 - Opposes Ritschlian and liberal theologies that domesticates atonement as moral influence or mere exemplarism.
 - Reaffirms classical federalism against tendencies that collapse federal headship into sociological or communal definitions of covenant.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reapplies scholastic categories (imputation, merit, active/passive obedience) with renewed biblical exegesis rather than purely systematic formulations.
 - Nuances the covenant of works vs covenant of grace distinction by careful attention to "substance" (the principle of law/merit) versus "administrations" (Mosaic, Adamic, etc.).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in 20th-century Reformed and evangelical scholarship as a standard statement of classical soteriology; frequently cited in debates on imputation, penal substitution, and the priority of Christus Victor/legal categories.
 - Used as a resource against modern revisionist interpretations (e.g., New Perspective critiques) and by conservative seminary curricula.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models rigorous exegetical-theological integration, defends the coherence of forensic justification, and supplies conceptual clarity for covenantal soteriology used in teaching and polemics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Forensic justification / imputation**
 - Justification as a legal declaration by God; Christ's righteousness is reckoned to the believer.
- **Penal substitution**
 - Christ endures the penal consequences of sin; Warfield grounds this in biblical categories of guilt and divine justice.
- **Active and passive obedience**
 - Active: Christ's perfect law-keeping; Passive: Christ's suffering and death - both necessary for full justification.
- **Covenant of works**
 - The principle of law/merit operative in Adamic headship; Warfield distinguishes its substance from particular covenantal administrations.
- **Covenant of grace**
 - Covenantal arrangement wherein salvation is accorded through Christ as federal head.
- **Federal headship**
 - Representative solidarity (Adam/Christ) explaining imputation of guilt and righteousness.
- **Total depravity / total inability**
 - Human inability to effect saving righteousness; necessitates sovereign, effectual grace.
- **Faith and repentance**
 - Faith is the instrumental means of receiving justification; repentance accompanies but does not merit justification.
- **Historia salutis vs Ordo salutis**
 - Historia: the objective historical accomplishment of redemption in Christ; Ordo: the application sequence in the believer - Warfield insists on the priority of historia.
- **Guilt, pollution, and death**
 - Threefold consequences of sin that justify penal and substitutionary atonement.
- **Sanctification vs Justification**
 - Distinct loci: sanctification is progressive renewal; justification is instantaneous forensic acquittal.
- **Scriptural exegesis as normative**
 - Warfield uses careful exegesis to secure doctrinal categories rather than importing philosophical presuppositions.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - As a definitional source for classical Reformed accounts of justification and imputation.
 - As polemic material against liberal, moralistic, or subjective reworkings of atonement and justification.
 - As an exegetical-model exemplar for integrating Pauline exegesis with systematic categories in teaching covenantal soteriology.
