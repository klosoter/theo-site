### TITLE
Barth and Covenant Theology (Michael Allen, in The Oxford Handbook of Karl Barth)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Late 20th / early 21st-century engagement with Karl Barth within analytic and Reformed scholarship. Allen writes as a contemporary Reformed theologian surveying Barth's relation to classical federal (covenant) theology.
 - The chapter appears in a synthetic handbook aimed at reconstructing Barth's theological significance for modern theology and for Reformed traditions.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Allen argues Barth both recovers and revises classical covenant theology: he retains the covenantal framework as constitutive for God-human relations but rejects key elements of the traditional articular schema (notably a prelapsarian Covenant of Works "as to substance") and re-centers covenant in the person and work of Christ.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: classical federalism posits two primary covenants (Works and Grace) with strong juridical and forensic categories; this tradition situates a Covenant of Works with Adam that is foundational for later soteriology.
 - Correction: Barth critiques the ontologizing and metaphysical assumptions behind a substantive Covenant of Works; for Barth, any covenantal reality is located in God's act in Christ rather than in a created legal status.
 - Retrieval: Barth retains the covenant schema because it best captures relational, historical, and revelatory dimensions of God's dealings with humanity - yet always as a Christological, redemptive-historical event.
 - Application to Mosaic covenant: Allen shows Barth treats the Sinai economy as a redemptive-historical administration (and as a witness/provisional form) rather than as evidence for a separate works-based covenant that secures status before God.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary focus: Karl Barth (as interpreted by Michael Allen).
 - Interlocutors: classical Reformed federal theologians (Calvin, the Westminster divines, later federalists who defended Covenant of Works), and Barth's contemporaries (e.g., Emil Brunner; broader neo-orthodox debates).
 - Secondary sources: Scripture (especially Genesis and Sinai texts), Barth's Church Dogmatics (esp. the treatment of creation, covenant, law, and Christ).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, law and gospel, creation, Christology, election, revelation, justification (forensic categories), and the Mosaic covenant's place in salvation history.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Barth reappropriates the covenantal form but relocates its substance in the decisive, Christocentric self-disclosure of God: covenant is not a juridical status established with Adam, but the living, reconciling relation God effects and sustains in Jesus Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - **Christocentric covenantality**: covenant is grounded in Christ's person and work rather than a proto-legal Adamic pact.
 - **Dialectical retrieval**: keeps the covenantal language while insisting on God's freedom and initiative; avoids natural theology readings of covenant.
 - **Redemptive-historical reading of Mosaic law**: Sinai is an administration/disciplinary stage, not proof of a works-based soteriology.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects classical federalism's ontologizing of a Covenant of Works "as to substance"; opposes readings that make Adam's covenant the ontological ground of later grace.
 - Critiques tendencies to reduce covenant to a moral-legal framework independent of Christ.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Moves from covenant-as-contract to covenant-as-divine-act/event: the covenant is God's active self-binding in Christ.
 - Emphasizes promise-command interplay in a Christological key rather than static covenantal statutes.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential among neo-orthodox and Barthian-reformed circles for recentering covenantal discourse on Christ.
 - Controversial among confessional federalists who see Barth as undermining systematic uses of the Covenant of Works; spurred renewed essays on Adam, creation, and covenant in Reformed theology.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes reexamination of covenant categories, stimulates Christ-centered hermeneutics of law and promise, and serves as a corrective to legalistic or metaphysical readings of federal theology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant (Bund)** - relational framework for God-human dealings; for Barth a dynamic, Christ-centered event.
- **Covenant of Works** - classical doctrine positing an Adamic covenant entailing obedience-for-life; Barth (per Allen) rejects its substantive ontological status.
 - **"As to substance"** - phrase in federal theology meaning the covenant's essential content; Allen notes Barth resists treating Adamic status as substantive ground for soteriology.
- **Covenant of Grace** - God's covenant of redemption administered in redemptive history; Barth preserves this but centers it in Christ alone.
- **Mosaic Covenant** - Sinai administration in redemption history; Barth treats it as provisional, pedagogical, and witness-bearing rather than foundational for soteriology.
- **Christocentrism** - theological orientation making Christ the decisive locus of covenantal reality and revelation.
- **Law and Gospel** - law functions pedagogically (to reveal sin and point to Christ); gospel is the promise fulfilled in Christ.
- **Election** - divine choosing that anchors covenant; Barth emphasizes God's sovereign election in Christ.
- **Creation vs. Covenant** - Barth resists a created "covenant" prior to revelation, preferring covenant as God's redemptive act.
- **Forensic / juridical categories** - traditional frames (status, imputation) are re-evaluated; Barth retains some forensic language but subordinates it to relational/event-centered categories.
- **Redemptive-historical administration** - way Barth reads biblical covenants as successive administrations of one saving act in Christ.
- **Promise-command interplay** - covenant as promise fulfilled and command interpreted in Christ's obedience.

How this chapter is used across loci:
- As a **conceptual pivot**: to reframe covenant theology around Christ rather than Adam or legal categories.
- As a **polemic**: entry-point for contesting classical formulations of the Covenant of Works (useful in debates over prelapsarian covenant).
- As an **exegetical model**: reading Sinai and Mosaic law as provisional administrations in salvation history.
- As a **definition source**: for courses examining modern receptions and revisions of Reformed covenant theology.
