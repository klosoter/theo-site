### TITLE
**Westminster Confession of Faith: A Guide (2013) - K. Scott Oliphint**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2013 amid a resurgence of confessional Reformed study and increased interaction between historical theology and analytic philosophy. Oliphint writes as a confessional Reformed theologian and analytic philosopher seeking to make the 1646 Westminster Confession intelligible and defensible for contemporary readers.
 - Milieu: post-Enlightenment ecclesial disputes, modern challenges to classical theism (open theism, process thought), and intra-evangelical debates (Arminianism, pietistic anti-confessionalism).

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The Westminster Confession is a coherent, God-centered theological system; understanding it requires attention to classical theistic doctrines (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) and the covenantal framework that orders doctrine and life.
 - Oliphint aims to show the confession's ongoing theological utility and to clarify misunderstandings arising from modern categories.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Stepwise exposition of the Confession's chapters, clarifying theological terms and logical relations.
 - Emphasis on the confession's starting point: the sovereignty and attributes of God as ground for covenant, revelation, and redemptive history.
 - Persistent defense of classical attributes against contemporary objections, showing their pastoral and doctrinal necessity.
 - Interweaving of doctrinal exposition with polemical correction (e.g., responding to open theism, Arminian readings).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Primary: Westminster divines (symbolically), Calvin and earlier Reformed theologians.
 - Secondary interlocutors: modern critics of confessionalism, open theists, process theologians, Arminians, and Roman Catholic claims; analytic philosophers used for conceptual clarification.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - God and divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility)
 - Revelation and Scripture, covenant theology (works and grace), Trinity, Christology, justification, sanctification, sacraments, church polity, and eschatology.

- **Closing line capturing center of gravity**
 - The Confession, rightly read, is a theocentric, covenantal system in which the classical attributes of God ground its doctrine and praxis.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong articulation of the confession as fundamentally about God's nature and covenantal relations rather than merely a set of propositional statements about salvation.
 - Clear, sustained defense of classical theism (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility) as integral to Reformed orthodoxy.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against readings that domesticate or sentimentalize the Confession; resists reduction to pietistic or solely soteriological concerns.
 - Corrects modern reinterpretations that compromise divine transcendence (e.g., open theism's revision of immutability/impassibility).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Uses analytic philosophical tools to clarify early modern scholastic categories within the Confession, making the doctrine of attributes less obscure for contemporary theology students.
 - Reframes covenantal logic to show how aseity and simplicity underpin divine action and promise.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Well-received in confessional Reformed circles and used as a seminary supplement; valued for clarity and apologetic utility.
 - Influential in contemporary defenses of classical theism among Reformed apologists and pastors seeking a readable guide to the WCF.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a bridge between seventeenth-century confessional formulations and twenty-first-century theological and philosophical concerns; ideal for teaching doctrine with precision and pastoral awareness.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine simplicity**
 - God is not composite; attributes are identical with God's essence. Oliphint insists this is essential to the Confession's portrayal of God.

- **Aseity**
 - God's self-existence and independence; grounds divine sovereignty and the reliability of covenant promise in Oliphint's reading.

- **Immutability**
 - God does not change in His being, decrees, or promises; used to defend God's faithfulness and to rebut process/open-theist claims.

- **Impassibility**
 - God does not suffer passively; Oliphint affirms a version consonant with the WCF while allowing for appropriate biblical language of divine emotion in a manner that preserves divine freedom and sovereignty.

- **Covenant of works / Covenant of grace**
 - Central organizing framework; God's attributes ground the moral and redemptive architecture of these covenants.

- **Revelation and authority of Scripture**
 - Scripture as the reliable, sufficient rule of faith; Confessional claims about Scripture are read in light of God's incommunicable attributes.

- **Predestination / election**
 - Viewed as a sovereign, gracious act coherent with God's immutable will and aseity.

- **Justification by faith**
 - Forensic declaration anchored in covenantal promise and God's unchanging righteousness.

- **Sacraments as seals**
 - Baptism and Lord's Supper function as signs and seals within covenantal administration.

- **Trinity**
 - One divine essence in three persons; Oliphint stresses this as not undermining divine simplicity or aseity.

- **Law and gospel**
 - Distinct but related loci ordered by covenant: law's role in convicting and gospel's role in effecting reconciliation.

- **Church and keys**
 - Ecclesial structure as covenant community governed by the word and sacraments; polity derives from doctrinal commitments.

- **How this work is used across loci**
 - Definition source: precise definitions of classical attributes and confessional formulations for classroom use.
 - Polemic: resource against open theism, process theology, and anti-confessional readings.
 - Exegetical model and conceptual pivot: analytic clarifications that model how to read confessionally while engaging modern philosophical questions.
