### TITLE
Karl Barth and Evangelical Theology: Convergences and Divergences (ed. Sung Wook Chung)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary ecumenical and confessional conversation (late 20th-21st century scholarship) aimed at reassessing Barth's legacy within historically Protestant evangelical and Reformed circles. The volume collects essays that map points of contact and contention between Barthian theology and various strains of evangelical theology (confessional, neo-evangelical, presuppositional).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To clarify where Karl Barth's theology can be integrated with, reformulates, or rightly opposes evangelical commitments-especially on revelation, the doctrine of God, and theological method-and to test whether Barth is friend or foe to evangelical identity.
- **Core argument or structure:** The book proceeds by (a) diagnosing major Barthian commitments (Word-event, election, Christocentrism, critique of natural theology), (b) placing them alongside key evangelical convictions (Scriptural authority/inerrancy, propositional revelation, soteriological emphases, apologological method), and (c) exploring convergences and divergences through case studies and doctrinal loci.
 - Major moves typically include: explicating Barth's rejection of autonomous natural theology; interrogating the doctrine of election as Christ's election; comparing Barthian revelation (Word-event) with evangelical propositionalism; assessing pastoral and ecclesial consequences.
 - A notable interlocutor included is Cornelius Van Til via the topic "Van Til's One Person Language and Its Critique," which is treated as a touchstone for debates about theological language, divine-human analogies, and presuppositional apologetics.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Karl Barth (primary), selected evangelical theologians (e.g., Carl F. H. Henry, J. I. Packer, Cornelius Van Til), classical Reformed sources (Calvin), and contemporary interpreters. Secondary scholarship on analogia entis, revelation, and Barthian exegesis is mobilized.
- **Doctrines treated:** Revelation/Word, Christology, election, Trinity (implicit in doctrine of Word and election), natural theology vs. revealed theology, apologology (including presuppositionalism), Scripture and authority, covenantal language.
- **Closing line capturing the work's theological center of gravity:** The volume frames Barth as a profoundly Christ-centered corrective to certain evangelical tendencies while insisting that fruitful engagement requires careful parsing of Barthian method and evangelical commitments rather than wholesale acceptance or rejection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents Barth as both corrective and resource: his emphasis on the **Word of God as event** reframes evangelical notions of propositional revelation without eliminating propositional content.
 - Highlights Barth's radical **transcendence and discontinuity** (no autonomous natural theology) as decisive for apologology and doctrine.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters naive forms of natural theology and purely rationalistic apologetics common in some evangelical circles.
 - Contrasts Barth's election-as-Christ with individualistic predestinarian readings prevalent in some Reformed-evangelical traditions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Reframes apologological language via engagement with Van Til's **"one-person language"** debate-examining whether theological language must be wholly derivative from God's self-revelation and whether Barth supplies a more dynamic account of divine-human predication.
 - Uses the category of the **Word-event** to mediate between existential encounter and doctrinal propositionality.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Prompted renewed interest among evangelicals in Barth's theology as a resource for robust Christocentric theology and for resisting accommodation to modernist natural theology.
 - Provoked critical pushback from defenders of biblical inerrancy and classical apologetics, but encouraged some neo-evangelicals and confessional Reformed theologians to re-evaluate Barth selectively.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise dossier for students on where Barth and evangelical theology meet or part ways; valuable for methodological reflection in preaching, apologetics, and systematic theology classrooms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Word-event (das Wort):** Barthian claim that revelation is an event of God's self-giving in Christ and preaching; used to challenge static propositionalism.
- **Revelation vs. Propositional Revelation:** Tension between evangelical insistence on propositional content and Barth's emphasis on eventful encounter.
- **Election (Christocentric):** Barth's doctrine that election is God's election of Jesus Christ and thus includes humanity in him; contrasts with individual-centered predestinarian models.
- **Analogia entis (analogy of being):** Rejected or circumscribed by Barth; the volume examines implications for natural theology.
- **Natural theology:** The contested category; Barth's general critique is foregrounded as corrective to common evangelical reliance on natural religion.
- **Presuppositionalism / Van Til's "one-person language":** Van Til's claim that all true theological language must proceed from God's self-revelation and that human language about God is derivative; the book engages critiques and continuations of this position.
 - Relation to Barth: both stress dependence on divine revelation, but Barth maintains distinctive Christocentric and dialectical emphases.
- **Dialectical theology:** Barthian method stressing paradox, judgment, and encounter; contrasted with conciliatory or evidentialist approaches.
- **Christocentrism:** Central ordering principle-doctrine and Scripture interpreted through the person and work of Christ.
- **Divine transcendence and discontinuity:** Emphasis on God's otherness; informs critique of human theological autonomy.
- **Apologology (evangelical vs. Barthian models):** The volume maps how Barthian critique reshapes evangelicals' defense of faith.
- **Scriptural authority:** Explored as mediator between Barth's theological exegesis and evangelical inerrancy claims.
- **Covenant language:** Used to bridge ecclesial and soteriological implications of Barth's thought.
- **Methodological pivot:** Barth's Word-event functions as a pivot for reorienting doctrines of revelation, Scripture, and apologetics.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for articulating Barthian categories (Word-event, Christocentric election) in evangelical syllabi.
- As a **polemic and dialogue partner** in debates over natural theology, inerrancy, and presuppositional apologetics (notably vis-a-vis Van Til).
- As an **exegetical-method model** for integrating dogmatic theology with preaching and pastoral practice.
