### TITLE
The Humanity and Divinity of Christ - B. B. Warfield

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 19th-early 20th century Princeton Reformed theology; Warfield writes as defender of confessional orthodoxy against liberal historicism and speculative theologies. Engages patristic, medieval, and Reformed sources in conversation with contemporary biblical scholarship and German criticism.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christ is fully God and fully man in one Person; any account that diminishes either nature (kenotic reductions, functionalist or merely moral-exemplar accounts) undermines redemption. The work is an apologetic and dogmatic clarification of how the two natures co-exist without confusion, change, division, or separation.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical grounding: careful reading of key New Testament texts that predicate divine and human properties of Christ.
 - Historical-theological synthesis: retrieval and appropriation of Chalcedonian and patristic norms to frame biblical data.
 - Doctrinal correction: critique of modern errors (kenoticism, adoptionism, modernist symbolism) and of simplistic attempts at commingling natures.
 - Systematic consequences: implications for atonement, mediation, resurrection, and the communication of attributes.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Appeals to Jesus texts (Paul, John, Hebrews), patristic authorities (Athanasius, Cyril), Chalcedonian Definition, Reformed scholastics (e.g., Turretin), and opponents including kenotic proponents and modern critical theologians.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology primarily; intersects with Trinity (the eternal Son), soteriology (atonement requires both natures), revelation (God incarnate as final self-disclosure), and occasional anthropology (true humanity of Christ).
- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - The hypostatic union secures redemption: the eternal Son assumed true human nature without losing divine identity, so that one Person can effect atonement through a fully divine yet genuinely human life, death, and resurrection.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Precision in predication: Warfield insists that biblical attributive language must be read with an eye to **personal** predication (what belongs to the Person) versus **natural** predication (what belongs to a nature).
 - Defense of historical creedal language (Chalcedon) as the proper hermeneutical-locus for interpreting Christological texts.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects predecessors who either blur the distinction (monophysitism, certain mystical identifications) or covertly divide the person (Nestorian tendencies). Strong refutation of kenoticism (the idea that the Son emptied essential divine attributes).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Renewed precision in deploying the communicatio idiomatum: clear taxonomy of the ways properties are ascribed to Christ (idioms of deity vs. idioms of humanity; personal vs. local predication).
 - Emphasizes methodological interplay of exegetical detail and dogmatic guardrails - not novel theological vocabulary but disciplined technical usage.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely influential in Reformed and conservative evangelical circles as a robust defense of Chalcedonian Christology against modernizing trends. Served as a touchstone in 20th-century orthodox responses to kenotic and liberal Christologies.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a compact, disciplined model for teaching classical Christology that marries New Testament exegesis with creedal formulation; valuable for apologetics, systematic theology, and pastoral catechesis.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union** - the union of two complete natures (divine and human) in one Person (the Son); central explanatory category.
- **Chalcedonian Definition** - the creed Warfield repeatedly appeals to as normative: Christ is to be confessed "in two natures, without confusion, without change, without division, without separation." (Site usage: Chalcedonian Definition And Two Natures Doctrine)
- **Communicatio Idiomatum** - the communication of properties; Warfield distinguishes forms of predication so that divine and human attributes can be ascribed to Christ without category mistake. (Site usage: Communicatio Idiomatum)
- **Person / Hypostasis** - emphasis on personal predication: properties can be said of the one Person who unites two natures.
- **Nature (Physis)** - full divinity and full humanity maintained; each nature retains its own properties.
- **Kenoticism** - the theory that the Son 'emptied' or relinquished divine attributes in the incarnation; Warfield rejects this as destructive of deity and soteriology.
- **Impassibility / Passibility** - discussion of how Christ's suffering relates to divine impassibility; Warfield protects divine immutability while allowing the Person to suffer in his human nature.
- **Extra Calvinisticum (implicit concern)** - maintaining that the divine Logos is not exhausted by the human nature; avoids requiring confinement of deity to the human nature.
- **Atonement implications** - insistence that both natures are necessary: only a true human could represent humanity; only a true divine could bear infinite warrant for sin.
- **Personal predication vs. natural predication** - analytic tool for parsing Scripture.
- **Union without mixture** - reiteration that union does not blend natures into a third nature.
- **Scriptural exegesis as normative** - Warfield's method: exegetical claims must be read within creedal categories, not vice versa.
- **Orthodox polemic tone** - uses dogmatic firmness to correct modern errors without abandoning critical engagement.

How the work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source**: authoritative articulation and defense of Chalcedonian two-natures Christology in Reformed teaching.
- As a **polemic**: standard rebuttal to kenotic and modernist Christologies.
- As an **exegetical model**: demonstrates careful handling of New Testament predications of Christ for doctrine-building.
