### TITLE
The Person of Christ (2013) - Robert Letham

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary Reformed/evangelical Anglican theological milieu (early 21st century). Written as a systematic, historically-informed defense of classical Christology amid renewed interest in patristic sources and renewed challenges from kenotic, liberal, and some process-theological readings of the incarnation.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Letham argues that authentic Christian theology requires upholding the Chalcedonian hypostatic union: Jesus is one person with two complete natures (divine and human). This includes a sober defense of **Christ's impeccability** - his genuine temptability and suffering without the possibility of sin - as essential to soteriology and orthodox Trinitarian doctrine.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical base: careful reading of key NT texts (e.g., Hebrews, the Synoptic temptations, John, Pauline Christology) to show Jesus' genuine humanity, temptation, knowledge, and sinlessness.
 - Historical-theological survey: patristic, medieval, Reformation and modern loci to recover consensus and diagnose deviations (Chalcedon, Cyril, Augustine, Aquinas, Calvin).
 - Doctrinal synthesis: articulation of the person-nature distinction; account of communicatio idiomatum and the limits of attributing properties across natures.
 - Systematic implications: implications for atonement, mediation, priesthood, and the doctrine of God (impassibility, immutability).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** extensive appeal to patristic authors (Athanasius, Cyril), medieval scholastics (Aquinas), Reformers (Calvin), and modern theological opponents (kenotic theologians, certain strands of liberal and existential Christology). Dialogues with contemporary evangelical scholarship seeking to reconcile vulnerability and classical orthodoxy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (person and natures), Trinity (implications for incarnation), incarnation/kenosis, impeccability vs. temptability, atonement (substitutionary and representative aspects), soteriology, communicatio idiomatum.
- **Closing line:** Letham's theological center: a robust Chalcedonian Christology that preserves **full deity and full humanity in one person**, sustaining genuine human experience (temptation, suffering) while affirming Christ's sinless and therefore **impeccable** mediatorial role.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Stresses that **impeccability** does not entail inauthentic humanity; Christ is truly tempted and free but morally incapable of sin because of the union with the divine person.
 - Careful boundary-work on communicatio idiomatum: affirms legitimate property attribution without collapsing natures or endorsing ontological change in the divine nature.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects kenotic proposals that require divine self-emptying as ontological diminution of deity; insists kenosis must be understood in relational/volitional terms within the divine will, not as alteration of divine attributes.
 - Counters liberal/existential accounts that prioritize Jesus' humanity to the detriment of his divine salvific efficacy.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Nuanced use of classical categories (e.g., "personal properties" vs. "natural properties") to avoid confusion in describing what belongs to the person versus what belongs to each nature.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely used in Reformed and evangelical seminaries as a clear, historically-rooted textbook on Christology; valued by pastors and academics seeking orthodox synthesis between patristic testimony and Reformed doctrine.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Exemplary model of historically-conscious, biblically-grounded Christological theology; particularly valuable for teaching on **impeccability**, the communicatio idiomatum, and practical implications for soteriology and preaching.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hypostatic Union:** One person (hypostasis) of the Son united to two complete natures (divine and human) without confusion, change, division, or separation - central Lethamian axiom.
- **Impeccability of Christ:** Christ's moral sinlessness; Letham affirms inability to sin as compatible with genuine temptability and freedom.
 - Distinguishes moral inability (due to union with divine person) from mere lack of temptation.
- **Communicatio Idiomatum:** Legitimate attribution of properties from each nature to the one person, used carefully to avoid ascribing divine properties to the human nature in a way that implies ontological change.
- **Chalcedonian Definition:** The classic formula Letham defends as normative for orthodox Christology.
- **Incarnation/Kenosis:** Affirms incarnation as real self-emptying in role and function, but rejects kenotic accounts that imply subtraction from divine essence.
- **Temptation & Passibility:** Maintains Christ is passible (suffers, is tempted) in his human nature while the divine person remains immutable; suffering is real and salvifically efficacious.
- **Personal vs. Natural Properties:** Employed to clarify how attributes belong to the person (e.g., acting) vs. to natures (e.g., omniscience, human growth).
- **Soteriological Implications:** Christ's impeccability is necessary for representative, substitutionary atonement; a sinning savior would invalidate mediation.
- **Mediator:** Christ as single mediator whose two natures enable him to represent both God and humanity.
- **Ontological Change:** Rejected as incoherent for the divine nature; Letham insists on divine immutability and impassibility properly understood.
- **Historical Continuity:** Emphasis on patristic and Reformation consensus as corrective to modern novelty.
- **Two Natures, One Person:** Recurrent formula stressing non-confusion and personal unity.
- **Moral Freedom:** Christ's freedom is real yet aligned perfectly to the divine will, enabling genuine obedience.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for orthodox Chalcedonian formulations in seminary Christology.
- As a **polemic resource** against kenotic theology, liberal collapses of deity/humanity, and contemporary proposals that diminish impeccability.
- As an **exegetical model** for reading temptation texts and Hebrews in ways that preserve both authentic humanity and sinlessness.
- As a **conceptual pivot** linking Trinitarian doctrine to practical soteriology (why Christ's sinlessness matters for atonement and mediation).
