### TITLE
**Systematic Theology (1938)** - Louis Berkhof 
A compact, confessional Reformed synthesis, integrating classic scholastic categories with pastoral clarity. Final, enlarged edition combining earlier prolegomena and loci into a single volume.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Late interwar era; Dutch-American Reformed milieu (CRC), post-Kuyper/Bavinck synthesis in English.
 - Written against liberal Protestantism, revivalist subjectivism, and rising dialectical theology; pedagogical text for seminary catechesis.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - To present a coherent, confessional Reformed dogmatics grounded in Scripture, ecclesial symbols, and catholic orthodoxy, ordering all doctrines around God's glory in the covenant of redemption and grace.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - **Prolegomena**: Nature/possibility of theology; revelation (general/special); inspiration, inerrancy, canon; method and principia.
 - **Theology Proper**: Being and attributes of God (incommunicable/communicable; absolute/relative); Trinity; decrees; creation; providence.
 - **Anthropology**: Image of God; dichotomy vs trichotomy; covenant of works; original righteousness.
 - **Hamartiology**: Nature and origin of sin; guilt, pollution, death; imputation (federal headship).
 - **Christology**: Person (two natures, one person); states and offices; active and passive obedience.
 - **Soteriology (Ordo Salutis)**: Pactum salutis; calling (general/effectual); regeneration; conversion (repentance and faith); justification; adoption; sanctification (decisive and progressive); perseverance. Includes **common grace** and preparatory operations.
 - **Ecclesiology & Means**: Invisible/visible church; marks; offices; discipline; means of grace (Word, baptism, Lord's Supper; Reformed spiritual presence).
 - **Eschatology**: Personal (death, intermediate state); general (parousia, resurrection, judgment, new creation); rejects chiliastic schemes.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Positively: Scripture; ecumenical creeds; Reformed confessions (Belgic, Heidelberg, Dort, Westminster); Augustine, Calvin, Turretin, Hodge, Bavinck, Kuyper.
 - Critiques: Pelagius/Semi-Pelagianism, Socinianism, Arminianism, Roman Catholic sacramentalism/merit, Lutheran ubiquity in eucharist, perfectionism, dispensational premillennialism, aspects of modernism and dialectical theology.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and Scripture; doctrine of God and Trinity; creation and providence; humanity and sin; covenants (works, grace, redemption); person/work of Christ; atonement (penal substitution); application of redemption; church and sacraments; last things.

- **Closing line**
 - The center of gravity is the triune God's self-glorification in covenantal grace, executed by Christ the federal head and applied by the Spirit through Word and sacrament.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Federal-covenantal frame**: pactum salutis grounding Christ's mediatorial headship; covenant of works and grace as structural.
 - **Attribute taxonomies**: incommunicable/communicable and **absolute/relative** attributes together, with divine simplicity and aseity foregrounded.
 - **Hamartiology**: dual emphasis on **guilt and pollution** culminating in death; immediate imputation under federal headship.
 - **Sanctification**: treats a decisive breach with sin alongside ongoing growth, resisting perfectionism.
 - **Common and preparatory grace**: distinguishes non-saving restraint/enlightenment from special grace and effectual calling.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Against trichotomy; defends **dichotomy** of body-soul.
 - Against moral influence or governmental atonement; asserts penal substitution and satisfaction.
 - Against visible-church reductionism; maintains **invisible/visible** distinction and marks.
 - Against chiliastic eschatologies; amillennial reading.
 - Moderates natural theology claims under the noetic effects of sin; upholds analogical knowledge and divine incomprehensibility.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Not novel but a disciplined English-language condensation of Bavinck/Kuyper with scholastic precision; consistent use of federal terms and ordo salutis as teaching scaffolds.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Standard mid-20th-century Reformed textbook; catechetical baseline in many seminaries; shaped pastors and laity.
 - Later complemented and sometimes critiqued by biblical-theological approaches; still valued for clarity and confessional fidelity.

- **Enduring value**
 - Reliable definitions, crisp taxonomies, and fair historical sketches; a stable reference across loci for teaching and doctrinal exams.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Pactum Salutis (Covenant of Redemption)**: Intra-trinitarian counsel establishing Christ as federal head securing the elect's salvation.
- **Covenant of Works / Covenant of Grace**: Adamic probation with promised life; postlapsarian administration of saving grace in Christ.
- **Absolute and Relative Attributes**: God as He is in Himself (aseity, simplicity) and as He relates to creation (justice, mercy), alongside incommunicable/communicable.
- **Divine Simplicity and Immutability**: Attributes undergirding the coherence of all God's perfections and the reliability of the decrees.
- **Dichotomy vs Trichotomy**: Human constitution as body-soul unity; trichotomy (body-soul-spirit) rejected as exegetically and theologically unstable.
- **Original Sin: Guilt and Pollution**: Forensic liability and moral corruption inherited from Adam; death as penal consequence.
 - Imputation: immediate, federal; corruption: propagated to all.
- **Common Grace and Preparatory Grace**: Non-saving restraint, order, cultural good; Spirit's common operations disposing but not effecting regeneration.
- **Effectual Calling and Regeneration**: Sovereign summons producing new life; distinguishes external call and inward work.
- **Justification and Adoption**: Forensic declaration based on Christ's righteousness (active and passive obedience); filial status granted.
- **Sanctification: Definitive and Progressive**: Once-for-all breach with sin's dominion and lifelong growth in holiness; denies perfectionism.
- **Perseverance of the Saints**: God preserves; saints persevere; pastoral assurance grounded in divine promise and means.
- **Visible and Invisible Church**: External covenant community and the assembly of the elect; tied to marks, offices, and discipline.
- **Means of Grace**: Word as primary; sacraments as signs and seals; spiritual presence in the Supper; infant baptism on covenant grounds.
- **Eschatology (Amillennial)**: Single return of Christ, general resurrection and judgment, new creation; millennium symbolic of present reign.

- **How this work is used**
 - As a **definition source** for exams, catechesis, and confessional alignment across loci.
 - As a **polemic baseline** against Pelagian/Arminian soteriology, trichotomy, perfectionism, and sacramental errors.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** for covenantal framing of Christology and soteriology, and for attribute taxonomies in theology proper.
