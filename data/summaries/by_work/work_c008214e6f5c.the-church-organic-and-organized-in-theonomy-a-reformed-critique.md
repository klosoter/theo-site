### TITLE
**Richard B. Gaffin Jr., "The Church: Organic and Organized" (in Theonomy: A Reformed Critique)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late 20th-century Reformed response to the rise of theonomy/Christian Reconstructionist proposals about law, church, and state. Gaffin writes from a confessional Westminster/Reformed perspective and as participant in ongoing debates about covenant, polity, and the role of civil magistrates.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The church must be understood as both an **organic** communion (the spiritual body of believers united to Christ) and an **organized** institution (visible congregation with offices, sacraments, and discipline). Conflating, subordinating, or reversing these dimensions distorts biblical ecclesiology and produces theological and practical errors.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Define and locate the **organic** element: union with Christ as the ontological ground of the church; salvation, election, and spiritual communion are realized in Christ and by the Holy Spirit.
 - Define and locate the **organized** element: instituted means (Word, sacraments, ordained ministry, discipline) serve to give visible form and accountability to the church in history.
 - Show the theological relation: the organized church derives authority and significance from the organic reality but is not reducible to it; both are necessary and properly ordered.
 - Critique of theonomist and other revisionist tendencies: resist attempts to make the civil magistrate or Mosaic civil law determinative for the church's constitution and discipline; resist tendencies to spiritualize away the visible, constituted nature of the congregation.
 - Articulate implications for ministry, sacraments, discipline, and the visible/invisible distinction: the presence of unbelievers in the visible church and the need for marks and discipline; the priority of Word and sacrament in constituting congregational life.
- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Engages the theonomic movement broadly (proposals linking Mosaic civil law to contemporary church and state practice) and reclaims classic Reformed resources (Westminster Confession, early Reformed theologians) and biblical-theological materials.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Ecclesiology, covenant theology, sacraments (ordinances), ministry and church offices, discipline, union with Christ, visible vs. invisible church, relation of church to civil magistrate.
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center: faithful Reformed ecclesiology preserves the priority of union with Christ (the church's organic reality) while affirming the essential, God-ordained reality of the organized church (Word, sacraments, offices, discipline) without capitulating either to spiritualizing abstraction or to civilizing conflation.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong insistence that **union with Christ** is the ontological ground of the church - not merely a helpful notion but determinative for how ecclesial offices and ordinances are understood and practiced.
 - Rigorous balance: neither privatizing the church as merely mystical nor reducing it to visible social/civil structures.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Corrects theonomist tendencies that collapse ecclesial identity into civil-legal categories or grant the civil magistrate undue authority over ecclesial matters.
 - Pushes back against purely voluntaristic or purely institutional accounts by integrating biblical union and historical institution.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - The clear pairing and sustained argument for an **organic-organized** dyad as mutually constitutive but theologically ordered; gives a theological grammar useful for confessional Reformed argument.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued within conservative Reformed and evangelical circles as a corrective to Reconstructionist/theonomic overreach; often cited in discussions about the limits of civil authority and the nature of church discipline.
- **Enduring value**
 - Useful for pastors and theologians who need a succinct, confessional articulation of how spiritual reality and instituted church life cohere; remains a go-to corrective in debates about visible/invisible church and church-state relations.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Organic church**
 - The spiritual body of believers united to Christ by the Holy Spirit; the ontological ground of ecclesial identity.
- **Organized church**
 - The visible congregation with instituted offices, sacraments, polity, and discipline; the historical expression of the organic reality.
- **Visible church**
 - The external, public assembly where the Word is preached and sacraments administered; includes both true believers and nominal members.
- **Invisible church**
 - The totality of the elect known perfectly only to God; corresponds most closely to the organic aspect.
- **Union with Christ**
 - Central theological principle grounding the church's existence and the efficacy of Word and sacraments.
- **Marks of the church**
 - Preaching of the Word, proper administration of the sacraments, and (implicitly) orderly discipline that indicate a true church in the visible realm.
- **Sacraments / ordinances**
 - Means instituted by Christ that mediate and certify union with Christ within the organized church; not mere symbols nor civil rites.
- **Discipline**
 - The organized church's practical means of preserving purity and witness; distinguished from civil coercion and to be exercised according to biblical norms.
- **Civil magistrate / church-state relation**
 - Rejected as the decisive determinant of church order; civil law cannot substitute for ecclesiastical authority and means.
- **Theonomy (as locus)**
 - The movement critiqued; used as a foil to clarify proper boundaries between civil law and ecclesiastical practice.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for the classical Reformed distinction between the visible and invisible church and the normative pairing of organic/organized.
- As a **polemic** against theonomic/Reconstructionist proposals that conflate ecclesial and civil spheres.
- As an **exegetical-model** touchstone for preaching, sacramental theology, and the practice of church discipline within confessional Reformed settings.
