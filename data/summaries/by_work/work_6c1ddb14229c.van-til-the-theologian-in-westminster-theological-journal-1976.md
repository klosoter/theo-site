### TITLE
Van Til: The Theologian - John M. Frame, Westminster Theological Journal (1976)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** 1976 essay by John M. Frame appearing in Westminster Theological Journal; situated in mid-20th-century Reformed scholarship shaped by the legacy of Cornelius Van Til, the rise of presuppositional apologetics, and renewed interest in Trinitarian and epistemological theology within evangelical/Reformed circles.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Frame diagnoses and defends Van Til's distinctive theological method while focusing on a contested verbal habit-what critics call Van Til's **"one-person language"**-and argues that this language, properly understood, is a systematic move to preserve divine unity and revelation rather than a covert Christological or modalist error.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Reconstructs Van Til's theological commitments: radical divine transcendence, the priority of God as the ultimate epistemic presupposition, and the inseparability of doctrine and apologetics.
 - Identifies critics' charge: that Van Til's language sometimes appears to collapse personal distinctions in the Trinity or to overemphasize unity in a way suggestive of modalism.
 - Offers exegetical-analytical defense: distinguishes Van Til's rhetorical and methodological emphases from formal doctrinal denial; shows how his emphasis on **God-as-one-knower** serves apologetic and epistemic functions without denying three persons.
 - Clarifies terminological and theological adjustments needed to read Van Til in continuity with classical Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Cornelius Van Til (primary subject); interlocutional attention to classical Reformed sources on Trinity and revelation (Patristic/Scholastic touchpoints implicit), and to contemporary critics within Reformed circles who worry about Christological and Trinitarian orthodoxy.
- **Doctrines treated:** Trinity (persons vs. being), Christology (incarnation and personhood), revelation (priority of divine self-disclosure and Word-centered epistemology), theology proper (divine unity and attributes), apologetics and epistemology (presuppositional method, antithesis).
- **Closing line capturing theological center of gravity:** Frame locates Van Til at the intersection of rigorous Trinitarian conviction and uncompromising presuppositional epistemology: his provocative language aims to safeguard God's absolute authority as the presupposition of knowledge and faith, and must be interpreted within that theological project rather than as a straightforward Christological redefinition.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Prioritizes **God's epistemic primacy**: God is not merely an object of knowledge but the condition for knowledge; this drives Van Til's verbal stress on divine unity.
 - Treats apologetics as inherently theological: apologetic method is a species of systematic theology, not a subsidiary enterprise.
 - Rhetorical compression: willing to use terse, startling phrases (e.g., one-person locutions) to force recognition of divine transcendence and revelation.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Contra critics who read Van Til as modalist, Frame insists his moves correct Enlightenment assumptions about creaturely autonomy, not orthodox Trinitarian categories.
 - Distinguishes Van Til from classical evidentialism: the latter treats evidence as neutral; Van Til insists on theological presuppositions.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasting theological language around **epistemic categories** (knower, knowledge, presupposition) rather than purely metaphysical ones.
 - Using "one-person language" diagnostically: a shorthand for a strategy that stresses divine unity as the ground of revelation.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - The essay helped legitimize Van Til as a systematic theologian, not merely an apologist, and influenced subsequent efforts to integrate Van Tilian apologetics with orthodox Trinitarian theology.
 - It became a reference point in intra-Reformed debates over proper Trinitarian formulations and the boundaries of presuppositional rhetoric.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Models careful exegetical-theological charity toward a provocative thinker.
 - Provides a compact case-study in how theological method, language, and apologetics interrelate-useful for seminars on doctrine, method, and Van Tilian studies.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **One-person language:** Van Til's rhetorically forceful way of speaking that emphasizes divine unity; Frame reads it as methodological, not modalist.
- **Presuppositionalism:** The view that Christian faith furnishes the necessary presuppositions for intelligible knowledge; central to Van Til and explicated sympathetically by Frame.
- **Antithesis:** Sharp opposition between Christian and non-Christian thought; Van Til's epistemic antithesis is defended and clarified.
- **Epistemic priority of God:** God as the ultimate condition for knowledge; a pivot for Van Til's theology and Frame's interpretation.
- **Trinity - persons vs. being:** The theological locus where critics pressed Van Til; Frame insists on distinguishing rhetorical emphasis from doctrinal denial.
- **Revelation (Word-centered):** Emphasis on Christ as the center of divine self-disclosure; explains why Van Til foregrounds unity in communicative acts.
- **Modalism (critique):** The charge addressed; Frame shows that linguistic compression does not equal doctrinal modalism.
- **Analogy and transcendence:** Van Til's stress on God's qualitative otherness and the analogical nature of creaturely knowledge.
- **Theology-apologetics integration:** The methodological claim that apologetics is a functional expression of systematic theology.
- **Rhetorical compression/paradox:** Acceptable theological practice for Van Til to use paradoxical language to dislodge false presuppositions.
- **Covenantal epistemology:** Underlying framework that links covenantal revelation to epistemic dependence.
- **Use in loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for reading Van Til's methodological vocabulary (one-person language, epistemic priority).
 - As a **polemic resource** to rebut modalist readings and to defend the coherence of presuppositionalism with orthodox Trinitarian doctrine.
 - As an **exegetical-model** for integrating theological method and doctrinal substance in teaching doctrine of God, Christology, and apologetics.
