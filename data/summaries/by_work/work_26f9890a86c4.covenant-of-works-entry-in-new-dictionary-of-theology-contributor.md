### TITLE
**Covenant of Works - Vern Poythress (New Dictionary of Theology, contributor)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed-evangelical reference work (New Dictionary of Theology, InterVarsity/IVP milieu). Poythress writes from a Reformed, confessional background with technical philosophical and biblical-theological sensibilities.
 - Engages both classical formulations (Reformation, Puritans, Westminster) and late 20th-early 21st century debates (analytic, historical, and biblical-theological critics).

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - The entry explains and evaluates the doctrine that God made a covenant with Adam (a "covenant of works" or "covenant of life") in which obedience merited life and disobedience merited death; it seeks to establish the biblical, theological, and historical warrant for that formulation and its relation to the covenant of grace.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exegetical anchors: Genesis 2:16-17 and covenantal language across Scripture; use of Pauline theology (Romans 5; 1 Corinthians 15) to connect Adam and Christ.
 - Theological analysis: definition of "works" covenant as a law-promise-penalty legal framework mediated by federal headship; role of *merit* and *imputation* made precise.
 - Historical survey: traces major articulations (Reformation, Puritans, Westminster, Reformed scholastics) and notes recent defenses and critiques.
 - Synthetic move: situates covenant of works vis-a-vis covenant of grace-both continuity (one redemptive-historical economy) and discontinuity (different parties, promises, and mediators).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Cites classical Protestant sources (Calvin, Westminster divines, Puritans), modern proponents (John Murray, Meredith Kline), critics from various trajectories, and topical treatments such as Poythress's own consideration of hypotheticals ("What If Adam Had Not Sinned").

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology, original sin, federal headship, imputation, Christology (Christ as second/representative Adam), soteriology (law/merit vs. grace), anthropology, biblical interpretation.

- **Closing line**
 - The entry centers the covenant of works as the biblically grounded, theologically necessary framework that locates Adam's federal responsibility and frames Christ's redemptive obedience as the rectifying, covenantal counterpart.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Careful lexical and covenantal distinction: highlights legal‑forensic aspects (promise/penalty structure) without collapsing the covenant into mere contract or modern moralism.
 - Attends to the hypothetical question (e.g., "What If Adam Had Not Sinned") to clarify the nature of promised life as reward vs. intrinsic created immortality.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Pushes back against accounts that either spiritualize away a concrete Adamic covenant or that make the covenant primarily ritualistic; insists on a robust federalist reading anchored in canonical theology.
 - Moderates extremes: neither automatic identification of every divine command as covenantal nor an overly schematic, system-building use of the category.

- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Distinguishes carefully between related labels: covenant of works, covenant of life, covenant of creation, and probation; clarifies *merit* vs. *meritoriousness* as applied to Adamic obedience.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Regarded as a clear, balanced dictionary treatment; used widely in Reformed seminaries and by students seeking a concise, reliable orientation to contested aspects of covenant theology.
 - Cited by those defending traditional federal formulations as well as by scholars who wish to map contested boundaries between covenant structures.

- **Enduring value**
 - Serves as a compact, exegetically aware primer that aids both historical orientation and contemporary debate; valuable for teaching the covenantal logic that connects creation, fall, and Christ.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works** - A covenant in which Adam, as federal head, would obtain life by perfect obedience; violation incurs death.
- **Covenant of Life** - Synonymous label emphasizing the promised reward rather than the juridical form.
- **Federal Headship / Representation** - Adam acts as representative; his status and actions are imputed to his descendants.
- **Imputation** - Transferal of Adam's guilt and Christ's righteousness to others; central to the covenantal account.
- **Merit / Reward** - The doctrine distinguishes merit as earned reward under a works covenant from salvation by grace.
- **Law / Command / Penalty** - Structural elements: command issued, obedience required, penalty for breach.
- **Covenant of Grace (contrast)** - Divine arrangement for salvation after the Fall where promise, not merit, secures life through Christ.
- **Second Adam / Typology** - Christ as the restorative representative who fulfills the covenantal demands Adam failed.
- **Probation** - The probationary aspect of Adam's state: the testing that determined continuance in life.
- **Hypothetical Obedience** - The thought-experiment (What if Adam had not sinned?) used to probe what the covenant entailed materially.
- **Covenant of Creation** - Broader frame linking the works-covenant to created order and divine purpose.
- **Imputed Righteousness vs. Infused Righteousness** - Clarifies forensic imputation (Reformed emphasis) against other soteriological accounts.
- **Historical Formulations** - Labels the main eras: Reformation, Puritan/Westminster, modern defenders (Murray, Kline), and critics.

- How this entry is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** - clear, compact working definition for classroom and lexicon.
 - As an **exegetical model** - points students to canonical proof-texts and hermeneutical moves linking Adam and Christ.
 - As a **polemic/pivot** - used both to defend classical federalism and to delimit debates with revisionist covenant theologians.
