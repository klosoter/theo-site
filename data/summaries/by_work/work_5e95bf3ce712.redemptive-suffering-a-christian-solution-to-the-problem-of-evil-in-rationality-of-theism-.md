### TITLE
"Redemptive Suffering: A Christian Solution to the Problem of Evil" - Marilyn McCord Adams, essay in Rationality of Theism (2004). 
Concise identification: analytic-theological theodicy arguing that Christian soteriology, centered on Christ's suffering, provides a distinctive solution to horrendous evils.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century analytic-theological engagement with the problem of evil; intersects analytic philosophy of religion, pastoral theology, and Christian doctrinal resources. Appears in a collected volume addressing rationality and faith.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Traditional theodicies that justify evil by appeal to greater goods fail to address **"horrendous evils"** - evils that can defeat a person's reason for living. Adams' thesis: only **redemptive suffering** rooted in the Incarnation and Christ's participation in human pain can render horrendous evils non-defeating and so provide the Christian solution to the problem of evil.
- **Core argument or structure**
 - Define and locate the problem: identify horrendous evils and why they resist standard greater-good accounts.
 - Critique of prevailing responses:
 - Free-will and soul-making theodicies insufficient because they explain instrumental goods but not the existential defeat of persons.
 - Appeals to overall world-optimality or moral balance do not restore the meaning of a sufferer's life.
 - Positive proposal:
 - God, in Christ, **enters** into human suffering, thereby offering a unique, personal good - redeeming relationship with God - that can outweigh or neutralize the defeat inflicted by horrendous evils.
 - Redemption is not merely consequential (a later good compensates earlier evil) but **transformative** of the evil's meaning because God personally shares and heals the suffering.
 - Implications for divine justice and providence: divine vindication and reparation are fundamentally soteriological rather than exclusively justificatory.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Engages analytic theodicy literature (notably free-will defenses and greater-good arguments), and interlocutes with classical figures implicitly (Augustine, Irenaeus) and contemporaries (e.g., Alvin Plantinga, proponents of soul-making).
 - Uses biblical witness (Job, Passion narratives) and Christology as central resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Christology (Incarnation and divine suffering), soteriology (redemption as meaning-restoration), providence, divine omnibenevolence and justice, moral psychology (reasons for living).
- **Closing line**
 - The theological center of gravity: **theodicy must be reconceived as a Christ-centered, soteriological account in which God's personal engagement with suffering redeems the very meanings that horrendous evils threaten to destroy.**

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Moves the debate from abstract justificatory calculus to **existential meaning** and personal defeat; foregrounds relational goods and God-as-companion.
 - Treats Christ's suffering not as a metaphysical balancing act but as the decisive means by which evil's meaning is transformed.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Contrasts with Augustine/Leibniz-style best-of-possible-world explanations and with purely voluntarist free-will defenses that neglect the victim's lived perspective.
 - Challenges soul-making approaches by insisting that some evils do not simply instrumentally produce goods but can annihilate reasons for living unless personally redeemed.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Popularized analytic use of **"horrendous evils"** and the notion of an evil being **defeating** (i.e., undermining a person's reasons for existence).
 - Introduces **redemptive suffering** as a theological category distinct from mere compensation or consequential goods.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in contemporary philosophy of religion and pastoral theology; spurred renewed interest in Christological responses to theodicy and in pastoral implications for sufferers.
 - Influential beyond Anglican/Reformed divides because of analytic clarity and pastoral sensitivity.
- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a durable corrective to purely justificatory models; valuable for ethics, pastoral care, and ecumenical discourse about suffering and divine action.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Horrendous evils** - evils that can defeat a person's basic reasons for living (e.g., extreme suffering, atrocities).
- **Defeat / Defeating** - the power of an evil to render life meaningless or to remove reasons for continued existence.
- **Redemptive suffering** - God's transformative engagement with suffering, making it non-defeating by imparting a surpassing relational good.
- **Serious good** - goods of such depth (not merely instrumental) that they can outweigh horrendous evils; chief example: personal relationship with God.
- **Christological solution** - the claim that only the Incarnation and Christ's passion uniquely enable redemption of horrendous evils.
- **Existential theodicy** - treating theodicy as recovery of meaning and personhood rather than primarily as moral justification of God.
- **Free-will defense (critique)** - Adams accepts limits of free-will accounts: they may explain some evils but not the defeat of persons by horrendous evils.
- **Soul-making theodicy (contrast)** - contrasted as inadequate where evil is not merely instrumental for moral development.
- **Theodicy vs. defense** - reorients debate from proving God's permissibility of evil to showing how God heals victims.
- **Divine vindication** - God's restorative justice that vindicates sufferers through soteriological means.
- **Personal goods vs. impersonal goods** - distinction between relational/participatory goods (central for Adams) and abstract goods often appealed to in classical theodicies.
- **Accompaniment / Divine presence** - God's empathetic presence in suffering is an ontological contributor to redemption.
- **Kenosis / divine suffering** - theological frame for how God can suffer and redeem without compromising divine perfection.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "horrendous evils" in philosophy of religion and theology.
- As a **polemic** against classical justificatory theodicies and as a corrective emphasizing soteriology.
- As a **pastoral and pastoral-theological model** for ministering to sufferers by prioritizing relational goods and divine accompaniment.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about divine suffering, kenosis, and the proper aims of theodicy.
