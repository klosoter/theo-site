### TITLE
Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (De Fide Orthodoxa) - John of Damascus (c. 7th-8th century). 
Also known as part of the Fountain of Knowledge; systematic catechetical summa of Eastern Nicene orthodoxy.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** composition mid-8th century within Byzantine monastic and iconodule milieu; reaction to iconoclasm and to lingering Arian/Macedonian variants; aimed to sum up patristic teaching for clergy and laity in accessible systematic form.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** to articulate and defend classical Nicene faith in a systematic, philosophically-aware register - especially the Trinity and the Incarnation - against heresy and confusion about persons and natures.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Book I: doctrine of God (names, attributes, Trinity, eternal generation and procession), metaphysical categories (ousia/hypostasis).
 - Book II: catalogue and refutation of heresies (from Marcion through iconoclasm-related positions).
 - Book III: liturgy, sacraments, Christian life and morals.
 - Major moves: define terms (essence/person), secure divine monarchy (Father as arche), maintain consubstantiality of Son and Spirit while preserving distinct hypostases, and establish the reality of the Incarnation without confusion or division (hypostatic union).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** heavy use of Augustine, Athanasius, the Cappadocians (Basil, Gregory of Nyssa, Gregory Nazianzen), the Nicene-Constantinopolitan formulae; engages Arians, Apollinarians, Nestorians, Monophysites, and Macedonians.
- **Doctrines treated:** revelation, Trinity (eternal generation, spiration), Christology (Incarnation, hypostatic union, communicatio idiomatum), soteriology as consequence of Incarnation, ecclesiology and sacramental practice.
- **Closing line:** John aims to hold together the **oneness of God and the distinctness of persons**, and the **fullness of both natures in the one Person of the Word**, thereby safeguarding orthodox worship and pastoral life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Clear, pedagogical presentation using philosophical categories (ousia/hypostasis) made accessible for clerical instruction.
 - Strong insistence on the monarchy of the Father while affirming eternal generation of the Son and the Spirit's procession (without Filioque).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Corrects Arian denial of Son's consubstantiality; rejects Macedonian denial of Spirit's deity; rejects both Nestorian separation of persons and Monophysite confusion of natures.
 - Opposes Western Filioque by maintaining single source (Father) in procession language (important for Eastern-Western divergence).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Systematic pairing of Greek metaphysical terms with pastoral exposition; influential in stabilizing the technical distinction between essence (ousia) and person/hypostasis.
 - Early, clear treatment of **communicatio idiomatum** (how attributes of both natures are ascribed to the one Person).
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Canonical in Eastern Orthodox theology and liturgy; principal patristic source for later Byzantine dogmatics.
 - Used in the West as a patristic authority (quoted by medieval theologians and scholastics), though filtered by disputes over procession (Filioque).
 - Limited direct use in Reformed theology; cited as patristic witness for Christological formulations and for terminology, but Reformed interlocutors often prioritize western scholastic sources for loci like communicatio idiomatum.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Teaches how to do pastoral systematic theology that is simultaneously doctrinally robust and accessible; indispensable for studies of Trinity, Incarnation, and patristic method.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Ousia (essence):** the divine being shared by Father, Son, Spirit; John emphasizes one ousia with three hypostases.
- **Hypostasis (person/real subsistence):** the distinct personal reality - Father, Son, Spirit - preserved without division.
- **Eternal Generation:** the Son is *eternally begotten* of the Father; a real relation within the Godhead that secures Son's deity (see Trinity material, Book I).
 - Used to rebut Arianism and to ground the Son's personal relation to the Father.
- **Spiration / Procession:** the Spirit proceeds (ekporeusis) from the Father; John affirms procession from the Father alone (important for Filioque debates).
- **Hypostatic Union:** the union of two natures (divine and human) in the one Person (hypostasis) of the Word; preserves distinction of natures without separation or confusion (Incarnation material, Book I).
- **Communicatio Idiomatum (communication of properties):** the theological rule by which properties of both natures are predicated of the one Person - e.g., "God suffered" in the sense that the one Person who is God suffered in his humanity.
 - John uses this to explain how scriptural ascriptions to Christ make sense without collapsing natures.
- **Consubstantial (homoousios):** sameness of essence; asserted for Son and Spirit with the Father.
- **Physis (nature):** human and divine natures; John keeps the distinction yet insists on their real union in the Word.
- **Prosopon / Person:** public/relational face/role; John navigates terminology to avoid Nestorian prosopic separations.
- **Idiomata (properties/attributes):** characteristics belonging to a nature, deployed in communicatio idiomatum.
- **Theotokos:** implicit and explicit defense by affirming that the Word became flesh (protects Marian confession against Nestorianism).
- **Heresy catalogue:** John's systematic refutations remain a go-to summary for identifying and naming Christological/Trinitarian errors.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for Trinity and Incarnation vocabulary (ousia/hypostasis; eternal generation; procession).
 - As a **polemic and refutation model** against historical heresies and for clarifying modus loquendi in Christological claims (communicatio idiomatum).
 - As an **exegetical and pedagogical model** for teaching pastors and seminarians how to translate patristic metaphysics into catechetical instruction.
