### TITLE
Sōma in Biblical Theology (1976) - Robert H. Gundry

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-1970s evangelical and academic milieu. Reaction to mid‑20th century form/semantic criticism (e.g., Bultmannian existential readings) and rising reevaluation of Pauline language; prefigures debates later labeled the New Perspective on Paul (NPP).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Gundry examines the semantic range and theological function of Greek sōma ("body") and argues that careful lexical-historical attention to sōma clarifies key Pauline loci-anthropology, Christology, ecclesiology and soteriology-and bears directly on debates over **justification** and **forensic imputation** vs. participatory readings.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Lexical survey: LXX and Hellenistic usages to show flexibility (physical body, corporate body, instrumentality, social embodiment).
 - Gospels and Paul: tracing continuity and distinctive Pauline moves (e.g., body language applied to Christ, church, believer).
 - Theological synthesis: sōma as both concrete bodily reality (resurrection body) and corporate locus (body of Christ) that undergirds representation and participation language in Paul.
 - Doctrinal implication: a theologized sōma permits a reading that honors forensic imputation while also accounting for union with Christ and corporate identity.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Extensive use of LXX, classical Greek parallels, Paul's letters (esp. Romans, 1 Corinthians, Ephesians), interaction with Bultmannian scholarship and emergent social readings of Paul; anticipatory engagement with themes later raised by Sanders, Dunn and Wright.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (body/spirit), Christology (incarnation, representative body), Soteriology (justification, imputation, participation), Ecclesiology (body of Christ), Eschatology (resurrection body), hermeneutics (lexical-historical method).
- **Closing line:** Gundry situates sōma as the pivotal theological grammar by which Paul can simultaneously teach union with Christ and the reality of Christ's representative action - a resource that preserves forensic imputation without reducing Pauline soteriology to mere legal abstraction.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Insistence on disciplined lexical-historical exegesis of sōma across Testaments as decisive for theological interpretation.
 - Emphasis that bodily language in Paul is not merely metaphorical or existential; it often marks *concrete corporate realities* with juridical consequences.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushback against purely existential Bultmannian readings that desomatize Paul.
 - Corrects social/participation-only readings by showing how corporate body language supports both participation and representation/imputation.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Elevates the category **"corporate sōma"** as a theological pivot that links Christ's bodily action to communal and forensic effects.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in conservative and confessional circles as a lexical and exegetical corrective to approaches that either sentimentalize "the body" or evacuate legal categories.
 - Cited by later Pauline interpreters who seek to integrate forensic and participatory motifs; occasionally used as a foil by proponents of the NPP who emphasize covenantal/nomistic matrices.
- **Enduring value:**
 - Durable resource for students needing a precise account of Pauline body-language.
 - Useful bridge-work for scholars seeking to negotiate between classical Reformed forensic categories and newer sociological/participation emphases.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **sōma (body):** core semantic field - physical body, corporate body, instrumental body; Gundry insists on context-driven determination.
- **soma Christou (body of Christ):** corporate expression that grounds ecclesial identity and mediates Christ's representative efficacy.
- **union with Christ / participation (koinonia):** relational union expressed through bodily language; not opposed to forensic categories but complementary.
- **forensic imputation:** legal/representative accounting of Christ's righteousness; Gundry argues sōma-language can underpin this idea without flattening it.
- **justification:** treated as a theological locus combining legal declaration and participation in Christ's body; Gundry defends retention of forensic language.
- **representation / corporate personality:** the mechanism by which Christ's bodily action is reckoned to believers; corporate sōma supplies the imagery for representation.
- **resurrection body:** affirmation of bodily continuity and eschatological embodiment-contra overly spiritualized readings.
- **ecclesiology (mystical body):** church as concrete soteriological organism, not merely moral community.
- **lexical-historical method:** Gundry's recommended hermeneutical tool for sōma studies.
- **participation vs. imputation tension:** Gundry frames this as resolvable through careful attention to body-language rather than adopting an either/or posture.
- **LXX usage:** demonstrates extended meanings carried into NT usage.
- **anthropology (body/spirit interplay):** stresses embodied personhood as theological starting point.
- **atonement imagery:** bodily motifs (death, resurrection, sacrifice) as loci for understanding substitution and representation.

- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition/source** for contested Pauline body-language and to ground lexical claims in preaching, commentary, and systematic theology.
 - As a **polemic** or corrective against both extreme forensic-reductionism and participation-only (NPP-style) accounts of justification.
 - As an **exegetical model** for integrating Pauline Christology, ecclesiology, and soteriology through a single semantic field (sōma).
