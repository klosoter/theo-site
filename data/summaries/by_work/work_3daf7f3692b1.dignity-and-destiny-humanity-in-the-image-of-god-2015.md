### TITLE
Dignity and Destiny: Humanity in the Image of God (John F. Kilner, 2015)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2015 amid renewed interdisciplinary interest in theological anthropology and bioethics; addresses debates in evangelical, Catholic, and secular bioethical literature about human worth, personhood, and rights.
 - Kilner writes as a theologian and bioethicist, aiming to bridge biblical exegesis, systematic theology, and practical ethics in medical and social settings.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The theological meaning of the *imago Dei* must account simultaneously for human **dignity** (present moral worth) and **destiny** (telos/fulfillment in God); a robust account integrates biblical, doctrinal, and ethical dimensions and resists reduction to a single feature (e.g., rationality, function, or relationality alone).

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Survey of historical and contemporary models of the image of God (substantive, relational, functional, vocational).
 - Biblical-theological exegesis of Genesis and New Testament witness, with Christological and eschatological framing (Christ as perfect image; restoration as destiny).
 - Systematic synthesis offering an **integrative/multidimensional account**: the image is embodied, relational, moral, and vocational - grounding dignity and orienting toward destiny.
 - Practical extension into bioethics, social policy, and pastoral implications (medical practice, human rights, disability, beginning/end of life issues).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scriptural focus: Genesis 1-2, Pauline and Johannine Christology.
 - Historical interlocutors: early church (Irenaeus), Augustine, Aquinas, Reformation figures (e.g., Calvin), modern theologians (Barth, Moltmann), and contemporary bioethicists and philosophers.
 - Dialogues with secular moral theory and human-rights discourse.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Creation and anthropology (imago Dei), sin and alienation, Christology (Christ as image and pattern), sanctification and restoration, eschatology (destiny), ethics (moral status and duties), ecclesiology (community as locus of restored image).

- **Closing line**
 - Kilner centers the imago Dei as a theologically grounded, multidimensional basis for human dignity and vocational destiny, connecting creation, incarnation, and eschatological renewal to concrete ethical concerns.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong insistence on an **integrative** model that refuses to reduce the image to any single attribute; marries dignity (status) with destiny (teleology).
 - Emphasis on **embodiment and sociality** - the image is corporeal and communal, not merely spiritual or conceptual.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors**
 - Rejects both narrow substantive accounts (e.g., reason alone) and purely functionalist accounts (image as dominion only); critiques overly abstract liberal human-rights treatments for lacking biblical telos.
 - Reorients some modern relational readings by reintroducing embodied vocation and eschatological renewal.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Use of paired categories **"dignity and destiny"** as a mnemonic and organizing principle linking present moral status with future restoration.
 - Frames the image as a **multidimensional construct** (embodiment, relationality, morality, vocation) rather than a single essence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely cited in evangelical and ecumenical bioethical discussions; used as a clarifying resource in theological anthropology courses and ethics seminars.
 - Praised for practical utility and interdisciplinary reach; critiqued by some specialists who prefer more sharply defined philosophical criteria for personhood or who argue Kilner's synthesis risks being ecumenically generic.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a teachable, theologically rich framework for pastors, ethicists, and policymakers confronting medical and social issues.
 - Durable as a bridge between biblical theology and applied ethics, especially in debates over dignity, disability, and human rights.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Imago Dei** - central theological category; Kilner treats it as multidimensional and the grounding for dignity and destiny.
- **Dignity** - present moral worth grounded in creation; secures prohibition of dehumanization and basic rights.
- **Destiny** - teleological aspect: human flourishing and restoration in Christ; eschatological orientation for ethics.
- **Embodiment** - stress on physicality: the image is incarnate, not merely a disembodied soul.
- **Relationality** - humans as created for communal reflection of the triune God; social ontology matters for ethics.
- **Vocation** - task-oriented dimension (work, stewardship, loving service) tied to divine purpose.
- **Restoration/renewal** - sin has marred the image; redemption in Christ restores and perfects human destiny.
- **Christ as Image** - Christology anchors the normative pattern and future telos of humanity.
- **Multidimensional/integrative model** - methodological term to describe Kilner's synthesis against one-dimensional accounts.
- **Moral status** - application-oriented term linking theology to bioethical judgments about personhood.
- **Intrinsic vs. relational dignity** - Kilner balances intrinsic worth (ontological claim) with relational expressions (how dignity is manifested and protected).
- **Teleology (telos)** - theological-scientific term used to orient ethics toward final purposes.
- **Social ontology** - emphasizes church, family, and institutions as loci for image-bearing life.
- **Practical bioethics** - applied domain Kilner addresses through case studies and policy implications.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for theological courses on the imago Dei and human dignity.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in bioethics to ground policies on personhood, disability, and end-of-life care.
 - As an **exegetical-model** that integrates Genesis and Christology for pastoral ethics and public theology.
