### TITLE
The Extent of the Covenant of Works: A Review of Recent Literature - G. Michael Thomas

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context:** Contemporary Reformed theology; engagement with late 20th-early 21st century scholarship on covenant theology. Positioned within ongoing debates over federal headship, the nature of Adam's probation, and the continuity/discontinuity between the covenants.
- **Central thesis/doctrinal problem:** How far does the covenant of works reach - is it confined to Adam as a unique probationary arrangement for a federal head, or does it have broader, ongoing purchase in human life, law, and covenant administrations? The work surveys and assesses recent arguments on the covenant's scope and theological consequences.
- **Core argument/structure:**
 - Exposition of the classical Reformed formulation of the covenant of works (conditions, promise of life, federal representation).
 - Survey of recent treatments: proponents who defend a robust, narrowly Adamic covenant; critics who minimize or reinterpret its scope; mediating positions that limit the covenant's normative status but preserve its typological/constitutional import.
 - Analysis of the implications for imputation, Christology (Christ as new Adam), the Mosaic law (republication thesis), and pastoral/theological practice.
 - Evaluation of exegetical claims (Genesis narratives, Pauline anthropology, covenant language in Scripture) and of systematic-theological coherence.
 - Concludes by recommending a guarded, historically-informed affirmation of a covenant of works as essential to classical federal theology while acknowledging necessary qualifications in application and typology.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical Reformed authorities (Calvin, Owen, Bavinck, Murray) as heirs and touchstones; recent covenant-theologians and critics across contemporary scholarship; juridical and suzerain-vassal treaty models are weighed alongside biblical exegesis.
- **Doctrines treated:** Covenant theology broadly; specifically federal headship, imputation (of Adam's sin and Christ's righteousness), Christology (Christ as representative), law and gospel distinction, anthropology (original righteousness/innocence), and covenant administrations (republication thesis).
- **Closing line:** Affirms that a historically-rooted covenant of works is the most coherent way to account for Adamic probation, corporate representation, and the logic of redemption, provided its scope is carefully delimited to preserve both biblical exegesis and pastoral application.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Emphasis on historical-contextual fidelity:** Thomas stresses recovering the covenant of works as taught in the classical Reformed corpus, resisting modern reductions that collapse the covenant into mere moral law or mythologize it as anachronistic.
- **Balanced critique of extremes:** Offers a corrective to both the maximalist extension (that the covenant of works functions unchanged across all administrations) and the minimalist collapse (that there was no covenantal arrangement at Eden).
- **Typological restraint:** Maintains Christ as the antitype/new Adam without simply replicating Edenic terms into later covenants; distinguishes representational mechanics from later administrative forms.
- **Integration of exegetical and systematic concerns:** Rather than privileging either discipline, Thomas insists on their mutual correction: exegesis must inform covenant formulation and systematic categories must account for canonical breadth.
- **Reception and influence:** Useful within conservative Reformed circles aiming to shore up classical federal theology; serves as a measured resource for seminaries and advanced study, often cited in syllabi addressing covenant theology disputes.
- **Enduring value:** Provides a concise, judicious survey of recent literature and a clear statement for those seeking a historically responsible defense of the covenant of works while avoiding polemical overreach.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Works:** The pre-fall covenant between God and Adam stipulating obedience as condition for life; primary subject of the work.
- **Federal Headship / Representation:** The doctrine that Adam acted for the human race; central to debates about the covenant's extent.
- **Imputation:** Transfer of righteousness or sin from head to members - how Adam's disobedience and Christ's obedience are accounted.
- **Adamic Probation:** The hypothesis that Eden was a trial wherein obedience would have secured life; a defining element of the covenant of works.
- **Covenant of Grace:** The complementary covenant securing salvation through Christ; Thomas examines its relation to the covenant of works.
- **Republication Thesis:** The claim that Mosaic law republishes the covenant of works; Thomas reviews defenses and limitations of this idea.
- **Typology / Antitype:** The use of Adam as a type of Christ; Thomas insists on analogical but non-identical application.
- **Suzerainty / Treaty Models:** Political-legal analogies used to describe covenant form and sanctions; evaluated for exegetical fit.
- **Law/Gospel distinction:** The interpretive framework for how covenant terms function ethically and soteriologically.
- **Merit vs. Grace:** The tension between works-based covenant promise and the gracious rescue of sinners in Christ; crucial for pastoral theology.
- **Covenant of Creation:** The broader backdrop against which some argue the covenant reaches beyond Adam to created order.
- **Corporate solidarity:** Social/ontological basis for representation and imputation.
- **Admonitory vs. Covenantal Law:** Differentiating legal functions to avoid conflating moral law with covenantal sanction.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** for seminary treatment of the covenant of works, giving a measured classic formulation.
- As a **polemic resource** against both eliminative and overextended readings of the covenant in contemporary theology.
- As an **exegetical-model reference**, especially on Genesis and Pauline passages tied to federal headship.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in courses on systematic theology where the costs and benefits of covenantal schemas are compared.
