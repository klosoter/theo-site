### TITLE
Practices of Belief: Selected Essays (2015) - Nicholas Wolterstorff

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Published 2015 as a collected volume of Wolterstorff's essays spanning several decades.
 - Situated at the intersection of analytic philosophy of religion, social epistemology, and Reformed Christian thought.
 - Responds to late 20th-early 21st century debates about evidentialism, testimony, and communal knowledge formation.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - Religious belief is best understood and evaluated as a set of *practices* embedded in communities; epistemic assessment must attend to these practices (testimony, worship, memory, reading Scripture), their norms, and responsibilities rather than only to isolated propositional evidence.
 - Theology of knowledge of God must account for testimony, trust, and communal formation without collapsing into either naive fideism or strict evidentialism.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Critique of individualistic evidentialism: epistemic justification cannot be reduced to private evidential calculations detached from social practices.
 - Positive proposal: a practice-sensitive epistemology that:
 - recognizes testimony and social transmission as primary sources of belief,
 - locates warrant in epistemic norms internal to practices,
 - emphasizes doxastic responsibility, integrity of testimony, and corrective obligations when injustices distort testimony.
 - Application across cases: religious testimony, ecclesial knowledge, apologetics, and the ethics of belief formation in communities.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Dialogues with mainstream analytic epistemologists and philosophers of religion (including the legacy of Alvin Plantinga and Reformed epistemology broadly).
 - Interaction with social epistemology literature on testimony, trust, and epistemic injustice.
 - Theological resources drawn from Reformed commitments to Scripture, tradition, and ecclesial formation, though arguments are framed philosophically.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation and testimony (how divine disclosure is mediated socially).
 - Authority and communal reception (ecclesial epistemic practices).
 - Epistemic responsibility and virtue (how believers ought to form and transmit belief).
 - Implicit Christological and covenantal shape-belief as formed within covenantal communities-even when not developed as systematic Christology.

- **Closing line**
 - Theologically, Wolterstorff anchors knowledge of God in accountable, communal practices: belief is a socially embedded, norm-governed activity that must be defended and reformed in light of justice, testimony, and faithful practices.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Treats belief primarily as *practice* rather than merely propositional assent; practices carry norms and forms of warrant.
 - Brings moral and social dimensions (justice, care for the vulnerable) into epistemic evaluation of religious belief.

- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals**
 - Contrasts with atomistic evidentialism and with purely individualistic versions of Reformed epistemology by stressing social transmission and communal norms.
 - Complements and sometimes critiques Plantinga-style properly basic belief proposals by insisting on the normative ecology of belief-formation.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Strategic use of "practices of belief" as analytic category linking theological formation and social epistemology.
 - Emphasis on testimony-as-practice (not merely as information transfer) and on corrective duties when testimony is suppressed.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Widely read among Christian philosophers and theologians as a bridge between analytic religious epistemology and social/ethical concerns.
 - Influential for courses on religious epistemology, testimonial justice, and ecclesial formation; prompts further work on communal epistemic virtues.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a robust model for integrating doctrinal concerns about revelation with contemporary epistemology.
 - Serves as a corrective to purely evidentialist or purely internalist accounts and remains a go-to resource for thinking about testimony, faith formation, and epistemic responsibility.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Practice / Practices of belief**
 - Believing construed as routinized, socially embedded actions governed by norms.

- **Testimony**
 - Primary vehicle for religious knowledge; evaluated as a practice with integrity, reliability, and moral dimensions.

- **Epistemic responsibility**
 - Duty to form, transmit, and critically assess beliefs in ways that respect truth and persons.

- **Warrant (practice-relative)**
 - Justification located in the functioning of epistemic practices, not only in isolated evidence.

- **Evidentialism (critique)**
 - The view Wolterstorff opposes insofar as it ignores the social/communal grounding of most belief.

- **Proper basicality (contextualized)**
 - Accepts that some beliefs can be non-inferentially rational but situates such basicality within communal practices.

- **Social epistemology**
 - Framework for analyzing how groups transmit and sustain beliefs; central to Wolterstorff's method.

- **Epistemic injustice**
 - Attention to how social power and prejudice distort testimonial exchange and thereby deform religious knowledge.

- **Ecclesial knowledge**
 - Knowledge as produced and sustained within the church's practices (worship, reading Scripture, catechesis).

- **Doxastic virtues**
 - Character traits that promote reliable belief formation (honesty, humility, attentiveness to testimony).

- **Trust**
 - A normative stance foundational to accepting testimony and sustaining communal epistemic life.

- **Formation**
 - Processes by which communities inculcate beliefs; central to assessing epistemic quality.

- **Authority (practical)**
 - Authority of testimony and tradition viewed as practice-grounded rather than merely hierarchical.

- **Truth vs. justice (implicit tension)**
 - Balancing concern for true belief with concern for just testimonial practices and protection of vulnerable speakers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "practice-based epistemology" in religious contexts.
- As a **polemic** against atomistic evidentialism and individualistic epistemologies of religion.
- As an **exegetical/ministerial model** for thinking about ecclesial formation and the transmission of faith.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates about testimonial injustice and the ethics of belief in theological education.
