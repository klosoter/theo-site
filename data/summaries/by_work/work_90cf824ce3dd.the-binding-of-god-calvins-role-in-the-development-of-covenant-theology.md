### TITLE
**The Binding of God: Calvin's Role in the Development of Covenant Theology** - Peter A. Lillback

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / Publication Context**
 - Late 20th-early 21st century reassessment of Reformation roots of covenant theology within conservative Reformed scholarship; interacts with scholarship that locates robust federalism later than Calvin.
 - Milieu: reaction to both minimalist readings of Calvin and modern critiques from open theism and secular historiography.

- **Central thesis**
 - Calvin is a principal architect of covenant theology because he consistently presents God as *bound* by promise and oath - a doctrine that secures divine faithfulness without surrendering sovereignty.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnostic: surveys pre-Reformation and contemporaneous medieval scholastic accounts of divine law, promise, and obligation.
 - Exegetical: reads Calvin's commentaries and Institutes to demonstrate persistent appeal to covenantal language and the concept of divine obligation (oath/promise).
 - Systematic: shows how Calvin integrates **absolute and relative attributes** of God so that divine immutability and freedom coexist with a moral obligation to keep promises.
 - Historical-theological: traces how Calvin's covenantal emphases shaped subsequent Reformed formulations (federal theology) and corrected certain errors (e.g., simplistic legalism or Pelagian tendencies).

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: John Calvin (commentaries, Institutes).
 - Interlocutors: medieval scholastics, Luther, later Reformed theologians (post-Calvin federalists).
 - Modern interlocutors: historians skeptical of Calvin's centrality to covenant theology; proponents of open theism.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Covenant** (of Grace and implications for Covenant of Works),
 - Divine attributes (absolute vs. relative),
 - Revelation and promise,
 - Christology (Christ as federal head and surety),
 - Soteriology (justification within covenantal promise),
 - Divine condescension and theodicy.

- **Closing line**
 - Lillback locates Calvin's theological center of gravity in the conviction that God freely and irrevocably binds Himself by covenant and oath, making divine faithfulness the foundation of covenantal salvation while preserving God's absolute lordship (see also Covenant Of Grace; Absolute And Relative Attributes).

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Presents the notion of God as *bound* not as a limitation of power but as a normative self-binding rooted in God's will and oath - a juridical and relational concept combined.
 - Stresses continuity between Genesis covenantal structure (Covenant Of Works) and New Testament promissory structure (Covenant Of Grace) in Calvin's thought.

- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Counters narratives that depict Calvin as non-federal or primarily forensic; argues Calvin's language and theology are foundational for later federalist clarity (Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition).
 - Pushes back against open theist readings by highlighting Calvin's appeal to divine oath and binding promise as incompatible with a radically indeterminate future (see Open Theism And Divine Condescension).

- **Conceptual innovations**
 - Clarifies the interplay of **absolute** versus **relative attributes**: sovereignty and immutability provide the basis, while relational attributes (faithfulness, covenant-love) provide the mode of divine action.
 - Reframes "binding" as theological vocabulary that secures both divine obligation and gracious condescension.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Instrumental in conservative Reformed circles to reassert Calvin's priority in the formation of federal theology.
 - Used in pedagogical settings to teach covenantal continuity and to defend orthodox views of divine immutability against processive or open-theist models.

- **Enduring value**
 - Offers a compact, polemically aware resource for understanding Calvin's covenantal commitments and for deploying Calvin against modern distortions of divine freedom and obligation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Covenant of Grace** - Calvin's central soteriological framework: salvation by promise and Christ's surety (referenced throughout; cf. Covenant Of Grace).
- **Covenant of Works** - Prelapsarian legal covenant; Lillback shows Calvin's implicit acceptance of a works-constituted relationship with Adam.
- **Binding of God** - Theol. claim that God binds Himself by promise/oath; normative self-limitation that secures faithfulness.
- **Absolute attributes** - Divine immutability, sovereignty; provide ontological basis for covenant acts (see Absolute And Relative Attributes).
- **Relative attributes** - God's communicable/relational traits (faithfulness, mercy) expressing covenantal character.
- **Oath / Promise** - Central juridical instrument in Calvin's theology that guarantees divine fidelity.
- **Federal head / Surety** - Christ functions as representative for elect in the covenantal structure.
- **Federalism (Covenant Theology)** - The architecture of redemptive history constructed on covenants; Lillback situates Calvin as formative (Covenant Theology In Reformed Tradition).
- **Divine Condescension** - God's voluntary self-emptying in covenant; reconciles sovereignty and approachability (see Open Theism And Divine Condescension).
- **Immutability & Faithfulness** - Tension resolved by God's commitment in oath: unchanging will committed to promise.
- **Promise-Predication** - Method for reading Scripture as a chain of divine promises.
- **Law / Gospel distinction** - Recast within covenantal terms: law in covenant of works, gospel in covenant of grace.
- **Human responsibility** - Covenant includes obligations; Calvin preserves human accountability within divine promise.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for Calvin's covenantal vocabulary and the notion of God's self-binding.
 - As a **polemic** resource against open theism and views that divorce divine sovereignty from covenantal obligation.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading Calvin on Genesis-Christ typology and for tracing Federal Headship across Scripture.
