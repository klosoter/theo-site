### TITLE
The Church as a Family: The Lord's Supper and Church Discipline - Vern Poythress (online essays)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Contemporary Reformed/Presbyterian context (late 20th-early 21st century). Online essay series by Vern Poythress, a conservative Reformed biblical theologian working within covenantal, confessional circles (Westminster tradition and Van Til/Frame intellectual milieu).
 - Pastoral-theological aim: to bring biblical theology to bear on sacramental practice and congregational order.

- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem**
 - The local church should be understood and ordered as a familial household; this metaphor governs sacramental admission (the Lord's Supper), baptismal practice, and the exercise of church discipline. Sacraments and discipline function as covenantal means by which the family identity of the church is protected, nurtured, and transmitted.

- **Core argument or structure**
 - Exegetical grounding: biblical household and family imagery (OT household of faith, NT ekklesia as family) underpin ecclesial practices.
 - Sacramental logic:
 - Baptism is the covenantal initiation into the household (sign and seal), to be interpreted in light of household inclusion (infant children of covenant households considered).
 - The Lord's Supper is a family meal marking covenant membership and spiritual communion with Christ (affirmation of a real/spiritual presence and communal participation).
 - Fencing and admission:
 - Communal rites must be fenced to preserve covenant identity and holiness; admission to the Lord's Supper is rightly managed by the gathered family via eldership and discipline.
 - Discipline as familial correction: pastoral correction aims at restoration into the household, not merely punitive exclusion.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Scripture (broad biblical-theological exegesis). Reformed confessions and pastoral practice (Westminster Confession/Directory for Public Worship implicitly present).
 - Classical sacramental disputants (Calvinian spiritual presence vs. Zwinglian memorialism; contrasted with Roman sacramentalism).
 - Contemporary Reformed interlocutors on paedobaptism, open vs. closed communion, and Presbyterian polity.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (household/covenant inclusion), sacraments (baptism and Lord's Supper), Christology (presence in the supper), ecclesiology (church government, offices, discipline), pastoral theology.

- **Closing line**
 - The church's identity as God's household requires sacramental practice and discipline to be governed by familial covenant logic: signs and meals both include and form a disciplined, visible family centered on Christ.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Persistent use of the family/household metaphor as the primary hermeneutical key for sacramental and disciplinary practice.
 - Integration of fencing the table with pastoral restoration: discipline is not merely punitive boundary-marking but formative family care.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects individualistic or purely private notions of communion (open-table practices) by insisting on communal adjudication and covenant membership.
 - Pushes back against both Romanist sacramental automatism and Zwinglian reductionism: affirms a real, spiritual presence while denying transubstantiational metaphysics.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Framing "fencing and admission" in household language-treating communion admission as family permission rather than mere congregational hospitality.
 - Describing baptism primarily as household initiation with attendant promises and responsibilities.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Received among conservative Reformed and Presbyterian pastors and theologians as a practical, biblically anchored resource for sacraments and discipline.
 - Used in discussions on communion practice (closed vs. open), and as a corrective in congregational life to lax admission and discipline.

- **Enduring value**
 - A clear, pastoral synthesis of covenant theology, sacramental theology, and ecclesial order-useful for pastors, presbyteries, and students seeking an integrated praxis of worship and discipline.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Church as family / household of God**
 - Primary interpretive lens; church life understood as parental and sibling relations, with duties and privileges.
- **Covenant sign and seal**
 - Baptism (primarily) as signifying and sealing covenant inclusion; not magical but covenantal efficacy.
- **Fencing the table**
 - Practice of delimiting who may partake of the Lord's Supper to preserve covenant purity and pastoral care.
- **Admission**
 - Elders/sessions authorize table participation as family recognition rather than mere private profession.
- **Presence of Christ (spiritual/real presence)**
 - Christ is truly present to communicants in a spiritual manner (Calvinian emphasis), not merely symbolic.
- **Lord's Supper as family meal**
 - Eucharist functions as covenant feast that expresses and shapes family identity.
- **Paedobaptism vs. credobaptism**
 - Baptism discussed in covenantal terms supporting household inclusion of infants; contrasted with believer-only baptism models.
- **Baptismal efficacy**
 - Efficacy understood covenantally and sacramentally (grace signified/sealed), not as automatic regeneration.
- **Presbyterian polity / eldership**
 - Government by elders, sessions responsible for admission and discipline; polity justified by family metaphors and apostolic practice.
- **Church discipline**
 - Correction aimed at restoration into the family; exercised publicly by officers when necessary.
- **Offices (elder/minister/deacon)**
 - Roles as pastoral family functions-teaching, ruling, caring.
- **Household catechesis**
 - Instruction of covenant children as part of family formation and sacramental preparation.
- **Communion of saints**
 - Mutual belonging and mutual accountability within the family framework.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for sacramental theology framed by household/covenant categories.
 - As a **polemic** against open-communion and purely memorialist positions.
 - As an **exegetical model** for reading household texts (OT/NT) into ecclesial practice and polity.
 - As a **practical pivot** for pastoral formation: guiding sessions on admission, baptismal instruction, and restorative discipline.
