### TITLE
The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson's Trinitarian Theology (Scott R. Swain, 2016)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2016 amid renewed attention to Trinitarian theology in Anglican, Lutheran, and Reformed circles.
 - Addresses the trajectory of late 20th‑/early 21st‑century "narrative" and "postliberal" theological moves associated with Robert W. Jenson and his reading of Barth and patristic sources.
 - Swain writes from a Reformed systematic perspective, engaging Jenson as a major contemporary locus for debates about God's attributes.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Jenson offers a robustly Trinitarian theology that prioritizes the narrative, temporal life of God; Swain both appreciates Jenson's recovery of the Trinity and critiques how Jenson's account reconfigures classical divine attributes (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility).
 - The problem: can a Trinitarian, narrative theology retain classical divine attributes without contradiction?

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition: sets out Jenson's key moves - God as historical actor, particularity of the divine life, and a temporally ordered divine life that resists timelessness.
 - Analysis: traces implications of Jenson's emphases for traditional attributes:
 - **Simplicity:** Jenson's emphasis on real distinction within the Trinity and on personal creaturely relations threatens classical simplicity.
 - **Aseity:** Jenson's portrayal of God as essentially related to creation (God's life as event) raises questions about aseity.
 - **Immutability & Impassibility:** Jenson affirms divine change and passibility in relation to God's action in history; Swain queries whether such claims undermine God's essential constancy.
 - Evaluation: balances commendation (Jenson's doctrinal attention to the economic Trinity, Christocentric focus, and scriptural narrativity) with a sustained defense of classical theistic categories reinterpreted in triune terms.
 - Conclusion: argues for a Trinitarian account that preserves the theological force of Jenson's narrative insights while recovering a coherent account of divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Robert W. Jenson.
 - Other interlocutors: Barth (influence on Jenson), Augustine and classical patristry, Aquinas/classical theism, contemporary Reformed thinkers, and proponents of the "passible God" (e.g., Moltmann).
 - Scriptural exegesis deployed to test theological claims about God's life and action.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (central), attributes of God (simplicity, aseity, immutability, impassibility), revelation, Christology (as central to Jenson's economic focus), and the relation of immanent and economic Trinity.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - The book presses for a Trinitarian theology that takes Jenson's narrative recovery seriously but insists that a biblical and classical account of God must safeguard divine simplicity, aseity, immutability, and impassibility so that God remains truly God in both immanent life and historical action.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Treats Jenson not merely as a creative theologian but as a systematic challenger to classical attributes; emphasizes methodological consequences for systematic theology.
 - Moves beyond polemic: constructive effort to show how Trinitarian doctrine can incorporate relationality without collapsing into creaturely dependence.

- **Corrections / contrasts to predecessors**
 - Contrasts Jenson's temporal, event‑centred God with Augustinian/Aquinian classical theism's emphasis on simplicity and eternality.
 - Offers a Reformed corrective to Jenson's sympathy with a passible, narratively constituted God (contrasting with Moltmann and some Barthian readings).

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Reframes classical attributes in explicitly Trinitarian idiom: e.g., arguing for a notion of simplicity that is compatible with intra‑Trinitarian distinction and economic action.
 - Articulates a nuanced account of divine passibility that protects aseity and immutability.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Positioned as a key Reformed response to contemporary Trinitarian revisionism; used in seminary dialogue on God's attributes and in debates over divine temporalism.
 - Cited where conservative theologians need a careful engagement with Jenson without caricature.

- **Enduring value**
 - Models careful interaction between historically minded Trinitarianism and classical theism.
 - Valuable for teaching the contested relation between doctrine of God and biblical narrative.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Divine Simplicity**
 - Classical doctrine that God's attributes are identical with His essence; Swain defends a Trinitarianly sensitive simplicity against Jenson's real distinctions.

- **Aseity**
 - God's self‑existence and independence; problematized by Jenson's portrayal of God's life as essentially relational to creation, defended by Swain as non‑negotiable.

- **Immutability**
 - God's unchanging being; treated as compatible with divine action, critiquing Jenson's stronger claims about divine change.

- **Impassibility**
 - Traditional claim that God does not suffer or undergo alteration from creaturely events; Swain pushes back against Jensonian passibility while allowing relational responsiveness in a non‑constitutive way.

- **Perichoresis**
 - Mutual indwelling of Father, Son, Spirit; Jenson emphasizes dynamic, particular relations; Swain insists perichoresis must preserve ontological unity.

- **Persona / Personhood (Trinitarian)**
 - Jenson's person‑centered language gives primacy to persons as loci of God's life; Swain explores how this interacts with simplicity.

- **Narrative Theology / Temporalism**
 - Theology that reads God's being through redemptive history; Swain values the method but resists its relocation of divine being into time.

- **Economic vs. Immanent Trinity**
 - Debate about priority of revealed (economic) over immanent life; Swain critiques Jenson's economy‑to‑immanent moves and argues for a doctrine that preserves both.

- **Particularity**
 - Jenson's stress on the particularity of God's acts (e.g., Christ as unique event); Swain asks how particularity sits with universal divine aseity.

- **God-as-event / God's life as history**
 - Jensonian motif that God's identity is manifested in historical acts; Swain reframes so that events reveal, not constitute, divine being.

- **Use across loci**
 - Definition source: used to define contemporary challenges to classical attributes in Trinitarian terms.
 - Polemic and exegetical model: deployed as a careful critique of narrative/temporalist readings and as a model for reading Scripture through a guardedly Trinitarian lens.
