### TITLE
Comments on an Old-New Error (Westminster Theological Journal 41, 1978) - Meredith G. Kline

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Late-1970s Reformed academy; Kline at Westminster Theological Seminary addressing recurring confusions in covenant theology and public theology amid renewed debates over Christian political responsibility (theonomy, reconstructionist pressures, and postwar federal theology reassessments).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Kline diagnoses an "old-new error" that improperly treats the Old and New Covenants as either wholly identical or wholly discontinuous in ways that distort the proper relationship of church and state and misapply Mosaic institutions to the Christian commonwealth.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Identification: defines the specific error - a faulty move in theological inference from continuity/discontinuity between covenants to concrete prescriptions for civil magistracy and ecclesial discipline.
 - Exegesis: marshals redemptive-historical texts and covenantal categories to show what is preserved in substance and what changes in administration between covenants.
 - Systematics: distinguishes *substance* of the covenant of grace (continuity) from *administration* and *civil status* (discontinuity), refusing simplistic threefold-law or plain moralism readings.
 - Practical-correlate: draws consequences for church-state relations - who exercises coercion, what norms govern civil law, and what belongs properly to ecclesial discipline.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged**
 - Implicit contrasts with both antinomian and rigid theonomic/reconstructionist tendencies; engages broader Reformed federal theologians and recent commentators pressing Mosaic civil law into New Testament polity.
 - Uses Scripture, Reformed confessions and typical federalist categories rather than polemical contemporary figures by name.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Covenant theology (covenant of grace/works), law (moral/ceremonial/civil issues reframed covenantally), church, state (magistrate), redemptive history, typology, and ecclesiastical discipline.
- **Closing line**
 - Kline insists theologically disciplined covenantal exegesis preserves redemptive-historical continuity while respecting administrative discontinuity - a balance necessary for a biblically faithful doctrine of church and state.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Strong use of redemptive-historical categories: the centrality of covenantal *substance-vs-administration* as the decisive hermeneutical key.
 - Refusal to reduce the Old-New relation to a mere moral/ceremonial/civil taxonomy; instead, grounds distinctions in covenantal administrations.
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects both a careless continuity that transfers Mosaic civil institutions intact into the Christian commonwealth and a careless discontinuity that denies any normative carryover of the covenantal structure.
 - Pushes back against theonomy-style claims that the Mosaic civil code should be enforced by modern magistrates without accounting for redemptive-historical transformation.
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Clarifies and reinforces the useful technical distinction between *substance* of the covenant (what is promised/secured) and *administration* (how the covenant is worked out historically), applying it specifically to public/political implications.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Valued among conservative Reformed scholars for methodological rigor; cited in subsequent debates over theonomy and magistrate authority as a measured corrective.
 - Used by both critics of extreme reconstructionism and proponents of covenantal public theology who want a disciplined middle course.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a concise, methodologically careful model for translating covenantal theology into church-state ethics; remains a recommended short corrective in courses on political theology and covenantal hermeneutics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Old-New Error** - the mistaken theological inference about how Old and New Covenant relations determine civil and ecclesial practice.
- **Covenant of Grace (substance vs administration)** - substance: the one promise of salvation across covenants; administration: the historical forms and civil arrangements that differ between epochs.
- **Covenant of Works** - background juridical-covenantal contrast that helps define continuity in human obligation and divine promise.
- **Redemptive-historical reading** - interpretive method emphasizing covenantal development over isolated law lists; Kline's hermeneutical stance.
- **Magistrate / civil coercion** - delineates the proper scope of state authority vis-a-vis ecclesial discipline, cautioned against uncritical importation of Mosaic civil measures.
- **Typology / fulfillment** - Old covenant institutions as types whose substance is fulfilled, not simply repeated, in the New.
- **Theonomy / Reconstructionism (as interlocutory target)** - movements that press for direct contemporary application of Mosaic civil law; Kline provides a critical corrective without antinomianism.
- **Threefold law schema (moral/ceremonial/civil)** - used cautiously; Kline prefers covenantal taxonomy to avoid oversimplification.
- **Administrative discontinuity** - concept highlighting that forms of social ordering can change while covenant substance remains.
- **Ecclesial discipline** - Church's internal governance, which Kline distinguishes from state coercive jurisdiction.
- **Typological civil institutions** - Mosaic civil laws as typological, requiring principled rather than literal transfer to modern polity.
- **Redemptive continuity** - what must be preserved for theological consistency across covenants.
- **Exegetical temperance** - Kline's recommended posture: careful, covenant-shaped exegesis before drawing political prescriptions.

- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for disciplined covenantal distinctions (substance vs administration) in courses on covenant theology.
 - As a **polemic** and cautionary brief against uncritical theonomic appropriation of Mosaic civil law.
 - As an **exegetical model** for applying redemptive-historical method to church-state questions and for defensible boundaries between ecclesial and civil jurisdiction.
