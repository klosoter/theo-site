### TITLE
Production Of Presence: What Meaning Cannot Convey - Hans U. Gumbrecht (Stanford Univ. Press, 2004)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context**
 - Early 21st-century humanities debate (published 2004). Response to dominant hermeneutic and meaning-centered approaches in literary studies and philosophy.
 - Emerges from continental influences (Heideggerian/phenomenological attention to Being, Benjaminian notions of aura) and the institutional moment when cultural studies sought alternatives to purely interpretive practice.
 - Author: Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht, literary theorist advocating renewed attention to materiality, affect, and "presence" in cultural artifacts.

- **Central thesis**
 - **Meaning (hermeneutic interpretation) systematically fails to capture certain experiential qualities.** Some aspects of human encounter with texts, objects, and events are not reducible to semantic content; they are forms of presence that are produced, attended to, and felt.
 - Scholarship should develop modes of description and practice that account for the *production of presence*-how things become phenomenally present independent of their conveyed meanings.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: dominant academic practice privileges interpretation and historical-contextual meaning, marginalizing experience, bodily affect, and material resonance.
 - Conceptual move: distinguish two registers-**meaning** (representational, communicative) and **presence** (phenomenal, affective, corporeal).
 - Methodological proposal: cultivate close attention to "presence effects" in texts, objects, events; develop descriptive vocabularies and practices (archaeologies of experience, attention to atmosphere, staging, and material techniques).
 - Practical examples: readings of literature, visual arts, performance that foreground sensory impact, temporality, and embodiment rather than semantic explication.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Heidegger (Being, presence), Walter Benjamin (aura), phenomenology (Husserlian moods/intentionality), and critical responses to Gadamer and Ricoeur (hermeneutic tradition).
 - Engages broader debates in literary theory, cultural studies, and aesthetics rather than explicit theological interlocutors.

- **Doctrines treated (theological relevance)**
 - Not explicitly doctrinal, but intersects with theological themes: **revelation**, **sacramentality**, **incarnation**, **presence/absence**, and **liturgical temporality**.
 - Offers resources for thinking about how the divine or sacred is experienced as presence beyond propositional content.

- **Closing line (theological center of gravity)**
 - Gumbrecht reframes a theological question: before and beyond what is said or believed, human communities encounter forms of presence that must be produced, attended to, and theorized-thus sacramental and incarnational theologies need an account of presence that meaning alone cannot supply.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Prioritizes **affect, materiality, and atmosphere** over representational meaning; sees "presence" as a cultural technique to be produced and studied.
 - Argues for methodological pluralism: interpretation complemented by descriptive practices attuned to sensory and temporal effects.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Explicit corrective to Gadamerian/Ricoeurian hermeneutics: interpretation is necessary but insufficient; it occludes non-semantic existences and experiences.
 - Contrasts with deconstructive/linguistic turns that reduce phenomena to texts or signs.

- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Coined and systematized the phrase **"production of presence"** as both descriptive and prescriptive scholarly stance.
 - Systematic use of **"presence effects"** and attention to **"atmosphere"** as analytic categories.

- **Reception and influence**
 - Significant in literary and cultural studies; adopted in aesthetics, performance studies, and liturgy scholarship.
 - Limited direct uptake in traditional Reformed systematic theology but increasingly cited in sacramental theology, practical theology, and interdisciplinary theological aesthetics.

- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes theologians to attend to non-propositional dimensions of faith practices (sacraments, worship, iconography).
 - Useful corrective in pastoral theology and liturgical design where sensory and temporal shaping matter.
 - Stimulates cross-disciplinary methods for describing how the sacred is enacted as presence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Presence effects** - sensory, temporal, or atmospheric impacts that make an object/event phenomenally present; resist semantic reduction.
- **Meaning** - representational, interpretive content; the domain Gumbrecht argues is overprivileged.
- **Production** - active cultural techniques, staging, or practices that instantiate presence (not merely passive reception).
- **Aura** (Benjaminian resonance) - singularity or immediacy of an object that conveys presence; deployed as analogical resource.
- **Atmosphere / Stimmung** - mood or ambient quality that situates bodies and yields a felt presence.
- **Materiality** - physical features (texture, weight, timbre) that contribute to presence; stresses body and object.
- **Embodiment** - the subjectivity of experiencing presence; bodily modes of attunement, perception, and affect.
- **Eventness** - presence as temporally bounded event rather than enduring semantic content.
- **Post-hermeneutic** - methodological stance: supplementing, not denying, hermeneutics with presence-oriented practices.
- **Staging / performance** - practices (liturgical, theatrical, artistic) that enact presence through arrangement and timing.
- **Non-propositional** - modes of meaninglessness in the sense of not reducible to propositional truth-claims, yet theologically salient.
- **Immanence vs. Transcendence** - implicit resource for rethinking divine encounter: presence emphasizes immanent experience without nullifying doctrinal transcendence.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for "presence" vs "meaning" in theological aesthetics and liturgical studies.
- As a **polemic** against exclusively propositional theology or interpretive methods that ignore sensory dimensions.
- As an **exegetical model** in homiletics and worship design: guide for reading texts for performative and atmospheric effect.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in sacramental and incarnational theology to argue for attention to how the holy is enacted materially and temporally.
