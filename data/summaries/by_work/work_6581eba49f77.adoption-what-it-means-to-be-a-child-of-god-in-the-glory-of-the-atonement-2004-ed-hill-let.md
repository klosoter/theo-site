### TITLE
Adoption: What It Means to Be a Child of God - Robert A. Peterson (essay in The Glory of the Atonement, 2004)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Essay in a 2004 Reformed/evangelical volume on the atonement (Hill & Letham, eds.). Situated in early-21st-century Reformed renewal: careful biblical theology of soteriological benefits with pastoral concern for assurance and worship.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Adoption is a distinct, essential benefit of the atonement that secures believers' change of legal status and confers filial privileges; it cannot be reduced merely to justification or to a generic relational experience.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Exegetical foundation: Pauline and Johannine sonship language (e.g., Romans 8, Galatians 4, Ephesians 1) shows adoption as both a juridical grant and present relational reality.
 - Theological synthesis: Adoption flows from union with Christ and the atoning work; it is effected by the Spirit and grounded in divine redemption.
 - Distinction from related doctrines: Clarifies how adoption relates to justification, reconciliation, and sanctification without collapsing them.
 - Pastoral implications: Adoption undergirds assurance, prayer, worship, Christian identity, and hope for inheritance.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Primary engagement with Scripture; dialogue with classical Reformed writers (Calvin, confessional tradition) and modern Reformed theologians (e.g., John Murray and other 20th-century soteriologists), and contemporary exegetical literature on huiothesia and Pauline theology.
- **Doctrines treated:** Soteriology (atonement, justification, adoption), pneumatology (Spirit as guarantor/witness), covenant theology (rights/privileges within covenant family), Christology (union with Christ as basis), ecclesiology and eschatology (inheritance and hope).
- **Closing line:** Adoption, rooted in the atonement and effected by the Spirit through union with Christ, is the sovereign, covenantal grant of filial status and privileges that transforms believers' legal standing and daily identity.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Strong insistence that adoption is both forensic (change of legal status) and relational (real, present filial privileges), held together rather than contrasted.
 - Emphasizes adoption as a direct fruit of the atonement rather than merely an outcome of regeneration or justification alone.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Pushes back on views that reduce adoption to psychological or purely relational language (i.e., relational regeneration without legal grounding).
 - Distinguishes from treatments that make adoption merely the decorative outcome of justification; Peterson stresses genuine, covenantal entitlement (inheritance, name, access).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Careful use of biblical terms (huiothesia) mapped onto forensic-covenantal categories without collapsing biblical imagery into a single modern technical term.
 - Balances "privileges" language with legal categories to preserve both experiential and objective dimensions.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Valued in Reformed circles for clarifying adoption's place in ordo salutis and pastoral theology; often cited in discussions that seek to integrate covenantal and forensic motifs.
- **Enduring value:**
 - A concise model for teaching adoption that is theologically dense yet pastorally oriented; useful for preaching on assurance, catechesis, and integrating soteriological loci.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Adoption (huiothesia):** The divine act granting believers filial status - legal adoption into God's family with attendant privileges.
- **Union with Christ:** The ontological and relational ground of adoption; through union believers receive status and blessings.
- **Atonement:** The redemptive work of Christ that secures the basis for adoption; adoption is presented as an effect or benefit of the atonement.
- **Justification:** Distinguished from adoption - justification changes legal guilt, adoption changes familial status and privileges.
 - Relation: Both are forensic benefits of Christ, often contemporaneous but conceptually distinct.
- **Reconciliation:** Addresses breach between God and sinners; adoption addresses entrance into covenantal family and rights.
- **Pneumatology / Spirit as witness:** The Spirit effectuates and testifies to adoption, guaranteeing inheritance and enabling filial experience.
- **Inheritance / eschatological hope:** Adoption confers guarantee of future inheritance and present access to covenant promises.
- **Filial privileges:** Access to God as Father, prayer, worship, discipline, and familial intimacy - not merely metaphorical.
- **Forensic vs. Relational language:** Peterson insists on holding both - legal status change + ongoing relational realities.
- **Covenant theology:** Adoption situated within covenantal structures: God as Father of a covenant people.
- **Assurance:** Pastoral implication - adoption provides objective grounds for assurance grounded in God's sovereign act.
- **Sonship language:** Masculine idiom in Scripture used corporately; Peterson addresses implications and pastoral framing.
- **Soteriological benefits:** Adoption named among Christ's benefits along with justification, sanctification, glorification.
- **Pastoral application:** Emphasizes teaching adoption to foster assurance, prayer life, corporate worship identity.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a succinct **definition source** for adoption within Reformed soteriology and ordo salutis treatments.
- As an **exegetical-model** for reading Pauline sonship texts that preserves both forensic and relational dimensions.
- As a **pastoral/theological pivot** in preaching and catechesis when linking atonement benefits to assurance, prayer, and Christian identity.
