### TITLE
**Fred Sanders, "Trinity Talk, Again" (First Things, 2017)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - 2017, in the wake of renewed evangelical debate about the Trinity (post-2016 EFS controversy), within a broader retrieval of pro-Nicene theology.
 - First Things audience: ecumenical, attentive to doctrinal precision and public theology.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Contemporary trinitarian discourse often confuses economic and immanent trinitarianism, misuses rules of speaking, and adopts non-classical terminology; Sanders urges a return to pro-Nicene grammar for clarity in doctrine, worship, and teaching. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Diagnosis: recurring cycles of Trinity talk generate confusion through collapse of immanent into economic or by speculative projections from economy into essence.
 - Retrieval: restate the classical pattern - one divine essence, three hypostases; inseparable operations; missions reveal processions; Scripture-guided confession.
 - Rules of speaking: affirm Rahner's Rule with guardrails; acknowledge Barth's revelational insights while warning against identity-collapses. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]
 - Terminological cautions: avoid calling the Trinity a single person; resist idiosyncratic formulas like Van Til's "one person" for the Godhead; keep predicates properly distributed. [Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique]
 - Practical counsel: prefer creed-formed confession over speculative or analogical elaborations; catechetical discipline before application.

- **Figures / sources / interlocutors**
 - Patristic and scholastic: Cappadocians, Augustine, Aquinas (backgrounded as norms of grammar).
 - Moderns: Karl Rahner, Karl Barth; evangelical debates (EFS/ERAS); Cornelius Van Til (as a cautionary example). 
 - Doctrinal standards: Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed; classical axioms such as opera ad extra indivisa.

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Trinity (essence-persons, processions-missions, inseparable operations, appropriations).
 - Revelation and economy-immanence relation.
 - Christology (eternal generation as doctrinal anchor for Sonship).
 - Divine simplicity and perfection.

- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Speak of the one God as Father, Son, and Holy Spirit by Scripture and creed, letting the economy norm our confession without collapsing it into the divine life.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - Strong re-centering on inseparable operations as the safeguard against social-trinitarian and subordinationist moves.
 - Clarifies that missions reveal and fit the processions without exhausting the divine life.
 - Pedagogical stress on predicate discipline: who is one, who are three; what is common, what is proper.

- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - To Rahner: uphold the rule while resisting readings that erase the immanent/economic distinction. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]
 - To Barth: appreciate his focus on God-in-revelation yet prevent identity formulae from becoming a metaphysical collapse.
 - To Van Til: reject calling God "one person" alongside "three persons" as a breach of Nicene grammar and a source of catechetical confusion. [Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique]
 - To evangelical pragmatism: discourage analogy-driven or application-first Trinity talk detached from dogmatic discipline.

- **Conceptual or terminological innovations**
 - Crisp restatement of classical guardrails (inseparable operations; missions/processions) for contemporary pedagogy.
 - Rules-of-thumb for safe speech: confess, then explain; distinguish essence vs hypostasis; economy interprets but does not determine essence.

- **Reception and influence**
 - In Reformed and evangelical circles, cited as a stabilizing voice post-EFS; used to critique non-classical person-language and to recalibrate uses of Rahner and Barth.
 - Wider ecumenical utility as a readable pro-Nicene refresher.

- **Enduring value**
 - A compact guide to trinitarian grammar for teachers and pastors; a checkpoint against conceptual drift; a model of retrieval without polemical excess.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic vs immanent Trinity**: God as revealed in redemptive history vs God in eternal triune life; related without identity-collapse.
- **Rahner's Rule**: The economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa; rightly read as a hermeneutical guideline, not a metaphysical reduction. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]
- **Barth's reformulation**: Emphasis on revelation as God's self-communication and being-in-act; helpful for christocentric focus but needs distinction safeguards. [Rahners Rule And Barths Reformulation]
- **Inseparable operations (opera ad extra indivisa sunt)**: All external works of God are undivided; personal distinctions manifest by order, not by partition.
- **Missions and processions**: Temporal sendings of Son and Spirit fittingly reveal eternal generation and spiration without exhausting them.
- **Homoousios / consubstantial**: The Son and Spirit share the identical divine essence with the Father.
- **Hypostasis / person**: Three really distinct persons; person-language belongs to the three, not to the one essence.
- **Divine simplicity**: God is not composed; underwrites inseparable operations and prohibits tritheist readings.
- **Appropriations**: Attributions of common works to one person for teaching, governed by Scripture and tradition.
- **Taxis (order of persons)**: Theological order rooted in processions; not a ladder of dignity or a warrant for eternal subordination.
- **Van Til's "one person" language**: An atypical Reformed proposal to call God "one person" as well as three; Sanders warns it confuses classical grammar and should be set aside. [Van Tils One Person Language And Its Critique]
- **Social trinitarianism**: Models that project human society into God; resisted by appeal to unity of essence and operations.
- **Doxological rule**: Let liturgical-confessional speech set the bounds of theological elaboration.

- **Uses across loci**
 - As a doctrinal-grammar primer for Trinity and revelation courses; a definitional checkpoint for economy/immanence and inseparable operations.
 - As a polemical reference against misapplications of Rahner and Barth and against Van Til's "one person" idiom.
 - As a pastoral-catechetical guide to shape preaching, catechesis, and doxology with pro-Nicene clarity.
