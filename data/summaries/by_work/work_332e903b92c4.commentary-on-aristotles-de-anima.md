### TITLE
Commentary on Aristotle's De Anima - Thomas Aquinas (mid-13th century scholastic commentary; hylomorphic anthropology and the immaterial intellect)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Mid-13th century scholasticism (University of Paris/Naples milieu). Part of Aquinas's program to reconcile Aristotelian natural philosophy with Christian doctrine using Latin translations of Aristotle plus Arabic commentators (Avicenna, Averroes) and patristic resources (Augustine, Boethius).
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** To explicate Aristotle's account of the soul while resolving tensions between Aristotle's naturalism and Christian claims about the soul's immateriality, personal survival, and the requirements of resurrection. The theological problem: how to hold both the unity of the human person and the immortality/subsistence of the intellect without collapsing into Platonic dualism or a materialist reductionism.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Exegetical unpacking of Aristotle's De Anima book-by-book: nature of soul, soul as principle of life, faculties/powers (vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, locomotive, intellective).
 - Hylomorphic account: soul is the substantial form of a living body (one composite); this explains life, unity, and organic operation.
 - Distinction of faculties: vegetative/sensitive vs intellectual; the intellect's operations are immaterial and require special treatment.
 - Defense of the intellectual soul's immateriality and subsistence (hence personal persistence), while maintaining that the human person is essentially a body-soul composite requiring resurrection for full human flourishing.
 - Philosophical-theological corrections to Averroist and Avicennian readings (especially on the agent intellect and the separability of intellect).
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Aristotle (primary), Averroes and Avicenna (commentators), Augustine and Boethius (patristic), Peter Lombard (scholastic), later medieval commentators derived from Aquinas.
- **Doctrines treated:** Anthropology (nature of person), soul (anima) and faculties, intellect (active/passive), immortality and subsistence of the soul, relationship of soul to body, imago Dei implications, and the theological doctrine of resurrection.
- **Closing line:** Aquinas locates the theological center of gravity in a **hylomorphic unity**: a single substantial soul that grounds personal identity and moral agency, whose immaterial intellect secures personal survival and theological hope in resurrection without endorsing a separable, independent "spirit" in the trichotomist sense.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Firm articulation of **hylomorphism**: soul as substantial form rather than a separate "thing" that merely inhabits the body.
 - Careful distinction between the plurality of powers and the unity of the soul as a single substantial principle.
 - Balance between natural-philosophical explanation and theological commitments (e.g., resurrection).
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Rejects Platonic/Cartesian dualism that makes soul a wholly separable substance in ordinary cognition and life.
 - Critiques Averroes' identification of the active intellect as a separate universal intellect; insists the active intellect belongs to the soul's power while preserving its immateriality.
 - Diverges from any simplistic trichotomist parsing that posits three ontologically distinct subsistences (body, soul, spirit).
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Clarifies "subsistence" vs "separability": intellectual operations are immaterial and capable of subsisting, yet the human person remains essentially composite until resurrection.
 - Nuanced use of "soul" to denote both formal principle and a subject of immaterial acts.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Massive influence on Catholic scholasticism and Catholic anthropology; assimilated into later medieval and early modern theological training.
 - Received with caution in Reformed circles; some Reformed scholastics engage Aquinas's nuanced hylomorphism selectively, while Protestant traditions often preserve dichotomous language but may adopt Thomistic arguments against crude dualism.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Exemplary model integrating philosophical rigor with theological commitments.
 - Central resource in debates about personhood, immortality, and the theology of the body/resurrection.
 - Crucial corrective to both materialism and simplistic dualisms in contemporary theological anthropology.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Hylomorphism:** Doctrine that substances are composites of matter (hyle) and form (morphe); soul is the form of a living body.
- **Substantial form:** The principle that makes a body a living individual; not a separate ghost but the organizing principle of the organic whole.
- **Soul (anima):** Single substantial form encompassing vegetative, sensitive, and intellectual powers.
- **Faculties/powers:** Vegetative (nutrition, growth), sensitive (perception, appetite), locomotive, and intellective (intellect and will).
- **Intellectus agens (agent intellect):** The active aspect of intellect; Aquinas insists it is an immaterial power of the soul, not an external universal intellect.
- **Intellectus possibilis (possible intellect):** The receptive, potential aspect of intellect that abstracts intelligible forms.
- **Subsistence vs separability:** Key distinction-intellectual soul can subsist (remain after bodily death) without implying absolute separability in the way Platonic dualism claims.
- **Immateriality of intellect:** Argument that intellectual operations are immaterial, grounding personal immortality.
- **Composite human (compositum):** Human person as body-soul unity; full human existence requires bodily resurrection.
- **Image of God (imago Dei):** Located primarily in the rational faculties (intellect and will) within the unity of the soul.
- **Resurrection:** Theological completion of human nature; preserves Thomistic insistence on embodied personhood.
- **Trichotomy vs Dichotomy:** Aquinas rejects the trichotomist insistence on three ontologically distinct substances (body, soul, spirit). He is closer to a **dichotomy only insofar as** he distinguishes corporeal vs incorporeal operations, but primarily defends a **unified hylomorphic soul** that undermines modern dualist/trichotomist schemas.
- **How this work is used across loci:**
 - As a **definition source** for classical Christian anthropology (precise philosophical terms for "soul" and "form").
 - As a **polemical resource** against Platonic/Cartesian dualism and modern trichotomy claims.
 - As an **exegetical/philosophical model** for connecting natural philosophy and theological doctrines (immortality, resurrection, imago Dei).
