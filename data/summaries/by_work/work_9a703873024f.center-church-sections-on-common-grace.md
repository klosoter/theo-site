### TITLE
Center Church - sections on Common Grace (Timothy Keller)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Published within Center Church (2012) as part of Keller's program for gospel-centered urban ministry. Written from an American evangelical/Reformed vantage, addressing pastors and church leaders ministering in pluralistic, post-Christian cities. Dialogues with Kuyperian public theology, modern evangelical apologetics, and civic engagement movements.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** How can Christians faithfully engage and cooperate with a non-Christian cultural order while maintaining gospel distinctiveness? Keller uses **common grace** to justify cultural partnership and to limit both cultural triumphalism and pietistic withdrawal.
- **Core argument / structure:**
 - Define and ground common grace in biblical teaching (creation, providence, general revelation).
 - Distinguish common (general) grace from special (saving) grace; show distinct theological and pastoral implications.
 - Trace practical consequences for cultural engagement: cooperation with non-Christians on civil goods, use of natural theology for apologetics, critique of culture rather than wholesale embrace.
 - Apply to ministries: arts, business, social justice, education, public policy - arguing for a gospel-shaped but cooperative public presence.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** 
 - Positive debt to **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** on common grace and sphere-sovereignty.
 - Engages evangelical voices on apologetics (classical and presuppositional strains) and critiques radical two-kingdom readings.
 - Implicit counterpoints include pietistic separatism and cultural accommodationist syncretism.
- **Doctrines treated:** common/general grace, special/saving grace, creation and imago Dei, providence, general revelation/natural theology, sin (total depravity articulated as limiting but not abolishing cultural good), Christ's lordship over culture, mission and ecclesiology, public theology.
- **Closing line (center of gravity):** Keller locates theologically robust cultural engagement within a Reformed account of common grace: Christians are called to cooperate with non-Christians for limited goods because God sustains created order and restrains sin, while remaining committed to the gospel as ultimate hope and critique.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Presents common grace as a **practical hermeneutic** for ministry in pluralistic cities - not merely a doctrinal sidebar but a ministry strategy.
 - Balances critique and cooperation: affirms cultural goods without conferring salvific status.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors/rivals:**
 - Pushes back against strict "two kingdoms" separatism that forbids meaningful cooperation with non-Christians.
 - Also critiques naïve cultural accommodation that equates cultural success with kingdom advance.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Recasts classic Kuyperian categories into pastoral praxis language (e.g., translating "sphere sovereignty" into actionable partnerships across sectors).
 - Emphasizes the **limit** of common grace - functional social goods vs. transformational salvation - as a recurring practical hinge.
- **Reception and influence:**
 - Widely influential among evangelical pastors seeking a Reformed framework for public engagement; used in sermons, leadership training, and church planting curricula.
 - Criticized by some confessionalists for downplaying boundary markers and by some postliberals for overemphasizing natural theology.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a concise template linking Reformed doctrine to urban ministry practice.
 - Valuable for teaching how doctrine informs cultural ethics, apologetics, and ecclesial strategy without reducing theology to programmatics.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Common grace:** God's non‑saving favor that sustains creation, restrains sin, and allows moral and cultural goods to exist apart from faith.
- **Special (saving) grace:** The particular, effectual grace that redeems and transforms persons by the Spirit - distinguished from common grace.
- **General revelation / natural theology:** Knowledge of God accessible through creation and reason; used cautiously as a basis for apologetics and public witness.
- **Cultural mandate:** The commission in Genesis (to steward and cultivate creation) interpreted as normative for Christian cultural engagement.
- **Restraint of sin:** The idea that God limits the effects of sin socially and politically, enabling ordered civic life and cooperation.
- **Sphere sovereignty (Kuyperian influence):** The principle that different cultural spheres have distinct responsibilities and authorities - adapted by Keller for partnership rather than separation.
- **Two-kingdom models (contrast):** Keller opposes overly rigid two-kingdom separations that prohibit cooperation; he affirms one cosmic Lord with distinct redemptive vs. cultural domains.
- **Public theology:** The practice of applying theological convictions to public life; Keller uses common grace to argue for responsible, nonsectarian engagement.
- **Civic/common good:** Shared goods (justice, education, art) that Christians may pursue with non-Christians under common grace.
- **Natural law (functional relation):** Implicitly appealed to as part of general revelation permitting moral reasoning in public discourse.
- **Imago Dei:** Grounds human dignity and explains why non-believing cultural achievements matter and merit Christian care.
- **Apologetics (practical use):** Natural theology and common grace supply starting points for rational engagement and moral persuasion.
- **Cultural critique vs. cooperation:** Distinction stressed - cooperate for limited goods, critique non-Christian worldviews as ultimately incomplete.
- **Use across loci:**
 - Pastoral practice and ecclesiology: as a **definition source** for how churches engage cities.
 - Apologetics/public theology: as a **conceptual pivot** to justify shared civic action and reasoned witness.
 - Polemical context: used **against** separatist two-kingdomism and against cultural accommodationism in preaching and church strategy.
