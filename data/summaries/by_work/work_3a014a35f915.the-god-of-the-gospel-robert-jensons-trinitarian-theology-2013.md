### TITLE
**The God of the Gospel: Robert Jenson's Trinitarian Theology (Scott R. Swain, 2013)**

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Published 2013; part of contemporary North American theological discourse engaging European systematicians (Jenson, Barth, Moltmann) and Reformed constructive concerns.
 - Milieu: renewed interest in Trinitarian theology after Barthian revival, conversation with analytic and historical theology, and debates about theological method (narrative vs metaphysical).
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Clarifies and assesses Robert W. Jenson's claim that the **Trinity is to be known and defined by the economy (God's acts in history, especially in the gospel)** and that that economy constitutes divine being - a proposal Swain reads as both constructive and problematic for Reformed orthodoxy.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Exposition: Jenson's theological grammar - narrative ontology, Christological normativity, the resurrection as constitutive for God's being.
 - Analysis: Jenson's collapse (or re-ordering) of the ontological/economic distinction and the implications for divine immutability, creation, and revelation.
 - Defense and criticism: Swain commends Jenson's recovery of the gospel-centered Trinity but raises concerns about grounding the doctrine so heavily in historical economy without adequate metaphysical safeguards.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Primary: Robert W. Jenson (systematic trajectories). Interlocutors: Karl Barth, Hegelian influences on Jenson, Augustine and classical Trinitarian tradition, Reformed theologians (e.g., Calvin) as corrective resources.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - **Trinity** (central), **Christology**, **revelation**, **ontology of God**, **eschatology**, **creation** and implications for **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**.
- **Closing line (center of gravity)**
 - Swain positions Jenson as a provocative and resourceful proponent of a gospel-shaped Trinitarian ontology: the God of the gospel is triune in and through the economic act, but this priority must be balanced with classical ontological safeguards to preserve divine reality beyond mere historical narration.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Elevates the **narrative/economic** articulation of God - the gospel event (incarnation, passion, resurrection) is the decisive revelation that *constitutes* divine identity.
 - Emphasizes **Christological normativity**: Jesus' history is the interpretive key to who God is ontologically.
- **Corrections / contrasts**
 - Contrasts with classical formulations that maintain a strict ontological/economic distinction (God's inner life prior to revelation). Swain points out where Jenson's move corrects abstract metaphysics that detaches doctrine from redemptive history.
 - Critiques Jenson where his reordering risks collapsing personhood into historical events or understating divine immutability and the reality of creation distinct from the economy.
- **Conceptual innovations**
 - "Narrative ontology": being-as-history rather than static metaphysical substance.
 - Prioritizing **resurrection** as the ontological pivot of God's identity (not merely a soteriological fact).
- **Reception and influence**
 - Influential in recent Trinitarian revival; taken seriously in Reformed circles for forcing a gospel-centered reading of God.
 - Provoked methodological debates: helpful impetus for evangelical and confessional theologians to rethink revelation; contested by defenders of classical ontological distinctions.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provokes assessment of how systematic theology must remain tethered to gospel events; stimulates careful recovery of the economic Trinity as normative while insisting on ontological coherence.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Economic Trinity**
 - God as revealed in God's actions toward creation and redemption; Jenson gives this priority as constitutive of divine being.
- **Ontological Trinity**
 - God as God in God's inner life; Jenson reinterprets this in light of economic revelation; Swain presses for retained ontological distinctives.
- **Narrative ontology**
 - The claim that God's being is best understood narratively (as history) rather than as ahistorical substance.
- **Christological normativity**
 - The idea that Christ-event norms doctrine of God; Jesus' life, death, resurrection define divine identity.
- **Resurrection-centrism**
 - Resurrection is the decisive disclosure/constitutive act of God's being and eschatological reality.
- **Revelation as self-attestation**
 - God's acts (especially in the gospel) are God's self-disclosure that grounds theological claims.
- **Divine immutability (concern)**
 - Traditional attribute challenged by a strongly economic-based ontology; Swain insists on a rearticulation that avoids making God contingent on temporal events.
- **Perichoresis (implied)**
 - Jenson's triune relations are historically realized; Swain insists perichoresis must retain ontological depth beyond story.
- **Creation and creaturely distinction**
 - Risk in Jenson: subordinating creation's ontological reality to the drama of redemption; Swain urges maintenance of Creator-creature asymmetry.
- **Theological method / Nature and Task of Theology**
 - Swain uses Jenson to argue that theology must be disciplined by Gospel narrative while also employing classical metaphysical categories for coherent doctrine.
- **Ontological vs Economic Trinity (topic citation)**
 - Central analytic frame: Jenson collapses or reorders the distinction; Swain evaluates the theological payoffs and dangers.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definition source** for a gospel-centered, narrative Trinitarian ontology (useful in Trinitarian and Christological loci).
- As a **polemic** and corrective resource against purely abstract metaphysics in systematic theology (methodology and revelation discussions).
- As an **exegetical model** for reading Scripture as constitutive of doctrine (esp. in biblical theology and doctrine of revelation).
- As a **conceptual pivot** in debates over the ontological/economic Trinity, prompting revisions that attempt to keep biblical economy and classical ontology in tension rather than collapse.
