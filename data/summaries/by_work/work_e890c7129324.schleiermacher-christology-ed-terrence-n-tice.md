### TITLE
Friedrich Schleiermacher - Christology (ed. Terrence N. Tice)

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting/publication context**
 - Early 19th-century German Protestant theology; Romantic and post-Kantian intellectual milieu. Schleiermacher writes as a corrective to both Enlightenment rationalism and confessional orthodoxy, shaping what became modern liberal theology.
 - The Tice volume collects Schleiermacher's Christological treatments (lectures, essays, selections) to display his method and doctrinal reworking.

- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - Christology must be grounded in the analysis of religious consciousness: Jesus is the one in whom the feeling of absolute dependence on God reaches its fullest concrete manifestation (the supreme "God-consciousness"), and thus functions as the unique mediator of religion for humanity.
 - Reframes classical questions (incarnation, atonement, offices) from metaphysical/ontological categories to experiential, ethical, and ecclesial ones.

- **Core argument / structure**
 - Start from the universal datum: religious feeling as "absolute dependence."
 - Historicize: discern in the person of Jesus the exemplary and normative realization of that feeling.
 - Elucidate Christ's mediatorial function: not as metaphysical hypostatic union but as the embodiment and communicative center of religious life.
 - Reinterpret classical loci (incarnation, atonement, resurrection, offices) within the categories of consciousness, influence, and community formation.

- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Explicit interlocutors: Kantian critical philosophy, Fichtean subjectivism, contemporary rationalist critics, conservative orthodox theologians.
 - Draws on New Testament exegesis but reads it through phenomenology of religious experience.
 - Anticipates and provokes later figures (Hegel in a different key; 20th-century liberal and dialectical theologians such as Barth in polemical response).

- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, incarnation (reinterpreted), atonement, resurrection, mediatorship, ecclesiology, ethics of discipleship, and the munus triplex (threefold office).

- **Closing line**
 - Schleiermacher's Christology centers on Christ as the perfected human achievement of religious consciousness who, by exemplary and communicative mediation, grounds the church's life rather than by metaphysical fusion with the divine.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases**
 - Priority of religious feeling ("Gefühl der schlechthinnigen Abhängigkeit") as theological starting point.
 - Christology as psychological-ethical and communicative: Jesus as the normative manifestation of God-consciousness that educates and forms believers.
- **Corrections/contrasts**
 - Rejects classical metaphysical formulations of the hypostatic union and ontological infusion of divinity into Christ; opposes penal-substitution and forensic atonement models.
 - Challenges pietistic voluntarism and Enlightenment deism by preserving a distinctively religious center while demythologizing metaphysics.
- **Conceptual/terminological innovations**
 - Recoding "divinity of Christ" into degrees of God-consciousness rather than metaphysical substantial categories.
 - Treats revelation in terms of communicative presence and ethical persuasion rather than propositional deposition.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Major formative influence on 19th- and 20th-century liberal Protestantism, historical-critical exegesis, and theology of religion.
 - Provoked sustained critique from confessional and later neo-orthodox theologians (e.g., Barth) who accused Schleiermacher of subjectivizing revelation.
- **Enduring value**
 - Provides a robust model for Christology that connects religious experience, ethics, and community; indispensable for studies in modern historical theology, theological method, and the rearticulation of offices like the munus triplex in non-metaphysical terms.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **God-consciousness (Gottesbewußtsein)** - Central datum: the awareness/feeling of dependence on God; Christ is the fullest human realization of this.
- **Feeling of absolute dependence** - Foundational religious category; methodologically prior to doctrine.
- **Mediator (Vermittler)** - Role of Christ conceived as communicator and exemplar of religion, not as ontological union.
- **Incarnation (reinterpreted)** - Not metaphysical hypostasis but the historical perfection of God-consciousness in a human life.
- **Atonement (moral influence model)** - Emphasis on transformative ethical and religious impact rather than juridical satisfaction.
- **Munus triplex (prophet-priest-king)** - Recast as functional descriptions:
 - Prophet: Christ as supreme revealer/teacher of God-consciousness.
 - Priest: Christ as representative and formative center for communal piety (not sacrificial expiation).
 - King: Christ as ethical and communal leader forming the church's life.
- **Revelation as communicative presence** - Revelation happens insofar as the divine reality is embodied and persuasive in Jesus' life.
- **Piety / ecclesial formation** - Church is locus where Christ's God-consciousness is reproduced by communal worship and ethical imitation.
- **Historicity / critical method** - Emphasizes the historical Jesus as the accessible locus of revelation, studied via critical exegesis and experiential reflection.
- **Exemplar theory** - Christ as moral-religious exemplar whose life invites conversion.

- How the work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for experience-based, non-metaphysical Christology and for translating classical offices into functionalist terms.
 - As a **polemic** against ontological/forensic accounts of the incarnation and atonement, often cited by critics and defenders of liberal Christology alike.
 - As an **exegetical model** for readings that prioritize the historical Jesus as normative religious exemplar rather than metaphysical mystery.
 - As a **conceptual pivot** in teaching theological method: demonstrates a theology rooted in anthropology of religious experience that reshapes doctrinal loci.
