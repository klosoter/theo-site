### TITLE
The Impeccability of Christ - Andrew Loke

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting or publication context:** Contemporary analytic-theological intervention (21st century). Situated in current Christological debates across analytic philosophy of religion, systematic theology, and evangelical scholarship; interacts with patristic, medieval, Reformation, and recent philosophical treatments of ability, freedom, and metaphysical possibility.
- **Central thesis or doctrinal problem:** Defends the **impeccability of Christ** - that in his incarnate state Christ could not sin - and aims to show this is coherent with true humanity, genuine temptation, and meaningful freedom.
- **Core argument or structure:**
 - Conceptual analysis of "ability" and modalities (logical, metaphysical, moral); distinguishes *could have sinned* in various senses.
 - Exegetical-theological argument from biblical portraits of Christ (sinlessness, temptations, obedience).
 - Christological-philosophical argument using the **hypostatic union**: the personal union of divine and human natures entails constraints on volitional possibilities.
 - Engagement with alternatives (peccability, compatibilist accounts, kenotic readings) and rebuttals via metaphysics of persons and divine attributes.
 - Pastoral and soteriological implications: how impeccability secures representative atonement without collapsing into docetism or denying real human experience.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors engaged:** Classical figures invoked include Augustine, Athanasius, Thomas Aquinas, and Reformers (e.g., Calvin) insofar as they bear on sinlessness and union; contemporary interlocutors include analytic philosophers of religion and theologians who defend peccability or emphasize kenotic models.
- **Doctrines treated:** Christology (hypostatic union, kenosis), Trinity (implications of divine immutability/impassibility), soteriology (representative obedience and atonement), anthropology (human freedom, temptation), philosophical theology (modal metaphysics, ability).
- **Closing line:** The work argues that Christ's inability to sin, grounded in his personal union with the divine Logos and a precise analysis of modalities and freedom, preserves both authentic humanity and the doctrinal necessity of a sinless Mediator.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations:**
 - Tight analytic parsing of different senses of "could": logical, metaphysical, moral, and circumstantial - applied systematically to Christ's choices.
 - Use of metaphysical personhood (one person with two natures) to show how divine properties constrain volitional possibility without abolishing human experience.
- **Corrections or contrasts to predecessors or rivals:**
 - Counters kenotic or radical peccability proposals that treat the incarnate Son as epistemically or morally defeasible in the same way as fallen humans.
 - Challenges accounts that equate genuine temptation with the genuine capacity to sin in the libertarian sense, offering compatibilist-friendly alternatives where temptation remains real but sin is impossible.
- **Conceptual or terminological innovations:**
 - Distinguishes **non-ability** (intrinsic inability due to nature/person) from coercion or lack of freedom; clarifies "moral inability" vs. "moral necessity."
 - Proposes working definitions for "temptation" that preserve experiential realism without implying peccability.
- **Reception and influence in Reformed and wider theology:**
 - Resonates with traditions emphasizing classical Christology and the necessity of a sinless mediator (broadly attractive to some Reformed and evangelical readers).
 - Provokes debate among scholars who prioritize kenosis, model of divine self-limitation, or libertarian freedom - functions as a focal text in contemporary imprimatur for impeccability arguments.
- **Enduring value for study and teaching:**
 - Serves as a clear, analytically disciplined statement of the impeccability position; useful in seminars bridging philosophy of religion and systematic theology.
 - Models how modal metaphysics can be responsibly brought to bear on historical doctrinal issues.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Impeccability:** The thesis that Christ, in his incarnate person, could not sin.
- **Peccability:** The opposing thesis that Christ could have sinned; Loke critiques this view.
- **Hypostatic union:** One person (the Son) with two natures; central explanatory vehicle for why divine properties affect human volitional possibilities.
- **Communicatio idiomatum:** Doctrine of the communication of properties; used to show how divine attributes relate to incarnate acts without confusion of natures.
- **Kenosis:** Christ's self-emptying; engaged and limited as an explanation for ethical/historical variation but not as entailment of moral defeasibility.
- **Temptation:** Defined in a way that preserves experiential genuineness (real solicitation) while not presupposing genuine capacity to sin.
- **Modal distinctions (logical/metaphysical/moral ability):**
 - Logical ability: absence of contradiction.
 - Metaphysical ability: what is possible given the nature of things.
 - Moral ability: agency under moral considerations and constraints.
- **Non-ability vs coercion:** Non-ability is intrinsic inability due to the person's nature; coercion removes freedom - Loke emphasizes the former for Christ.
- **Compatibilist freedom:** Freedom compatible with determinative constraints - invoked to reconcile impeccability with meaningful choice.
- **Representative obedience:** Soteriological role dependent on Christ's sinless obedience; impeccability secures its validity.
- **Divine impassibility/immutability:** Attributes considered for how divine nature informs incarnate possibilities; not treated monolithically but integrated into the person-nature account.
- **Sinlessness:** Moral perfection of Christ; both an outcome and explanatory datum for impeccability.
- **Moral necessity:** Theologically qualified necessity that still allows for real, non-coerced agency.
- **Ability-talk (analytic):** Precise use of "can/could" to avoid equivocation in Christological claims.

How this work is used across loci:
- As a **definitional source** in Christology classes for clarifying modes of ability and the doctrinal claim of impeccability.
- As a **polemic** against contemporary peccability and radical kenotic readings.
- As an **exegetical-conceptual model** for interpreting Gospel temptations and Pauline claims about Christ's obedience.
- As a **conceptual pivot** in discussions linking metaphysics of modality to soteriological and Trinitarian commitments.
