### TITLE
Calvin's Calvinism (Baker edition) 
Author: John Calvin 
Focus: Canonical exposition of Reformed theology as articulated in Calvin's Institutes, sermons, and commentaries; modern Baker edition collects/synthesizes Calvin's emphases for contemporary readers.

### OUTLINE NOTES
- **Setting / publication context**
 - Mid-16th century Reformation, Geneva as ecclesial laboratory; reaction against Roman Catholic sacramental and merit-based soteriology and against medieval scholasticism.
 - Calvin writes within an Augustinian trajectory but reconfigures doctrines for Protestant confessional identity.
- **Central thesis / doctrinal problem**
 - God's absolute sovereignty in redemption: salvation is initiated, accomplished and applied by God through Christ and the Spirit; human will is enabled only by divine grace.
- **Core argument / structure**
 - Scripture-centered systematic theology: revelation (God's Word) → person and work of Christ → application by the Spirit (calling, regeneration, faith) → forensic justification and progressive sanctification.
 - Predestination frames the economy of salvation: election explains the efficacy of calling and perseverance.
 - Emphasis on union with Christ as the ontological ground for all benefits (justification, adoption, sanctification).
 - Pastoral-legal interplay: doctrinal precision serves pastoral assurance and church order.
- **Figures, sources, interlocutors**
 - Draws on Augustine for grace and depravity; engages Luther on justification; opposes scholastic casuistry and Roman sacramentalism; anticipates debates with later Arminianism.
- **Doctrines treated**
 - Revelation, Scripture authority, Trinity, Christology, atonement (sufficient and efficacious), justification by faith, sanctification, predestination/election, covenant theology, sacraments (Baptism, Lord's Supper), ecclesiology, pastoral theology.
 - Two topical emphases cited in this dossier: **Regeneration and Effectual Calling** (site usage 1) and **Historia Salutis vs Ordo Salutis** (site usage 2).
 - On **Regeneration & Effectual Calling**: Calvin distinguishes external call (preaching, sacraments) from the inward, efficacious calling by the Spirit which effects regeneration and true faith; regeneration precedes and enables faith.
 - On **Historia vs Ordo Salutis**: Calvin's theology privileges the historical acts of God in Christ (historia salutis) while also employing logical ordering; he resists abstract separations that detach doctrinal order from God's saving acts in history.
- **Closing line**
 - Calvin's theology centers on the God-wrought union with Christ: by sovereign grace God unites sinners to Christ, secures their justification and sanctification, and orders salvation as an accomplished historical work applied effectually by the Spirit.

### DISTINCTIVES
- **Unique emphases or formulations**
 - **Union with Christ** as the organizing principle of soteriology (not merely juridical categories).
 - **Efficacious calling**: grace that actually brings about conversion - not merely persuasive or prevenient in a semi-Pelagian sense.
 - Strong pastoral concern for **assurance** grounded in objective acts of God (promises, sacraments, election).
- **Corrections or contrasts**
 - Corrects medieval merit/works-righteousness by radicalizing sola fide and sola gratia; differs from Luther by more developed doctrine of ecclesial discipline and sacramental signs.
 - Opposes any account that places ultimate causal power in the human will (Arminianism).
- **Conceptual / terminological innovations**
 - Shifts language from scholastic categories to biblical motifs: "effectual calling," "union with Christ," "participation in Christ" as explanatory keys.
 - Blends **historia salutis** sensitivity (God's saving acts in history) with ordered doctrinal exposition without treating them as rival frameworks.
- **Reception and influence**
 - Foundation for classical Reformed orthodoxy, later Calvinistic scholasticism, and modern Reformed confessions; key resource in debates on predestination, assurance, and the nature of grace.
- **Enduring value**
 - Models integration of exegesis, doctrine, and pastoral care; indispensable for teaching on calling, regeneration, and the relation of God's historical acts to systematic ordering of salvation.

### KEY TERMS & USES
- **Effectual calling** - the Spirit's inward, efficacious summons producing regeneration and faith; not identical to external preaching.
- **Regeneration (new birth)** - sovereign, Spirit-wrought renewal enabling true repentance and faith; precedes and grounds faith.
- **Union with Christ** - ontological union that grounds justification, adoption, sanctification, and perseverance.
- **Predestination / Election** - God's eternal decree to save some; the theological backdrop for assurance and the efficacy of calling.
- **Reprobation** - the correlative decree concerning those left in judgment; used polemically and pastorally.
- **Forensic justification** - declarative righteousness imputed by faith, grounded in Christ's obedience and atonement.
- **Sanctification** - progressive renewal produced by union with Christ and the Spirit; morally transformative but distinct from justification.
- **Historia salutis** - the historical sequence of God's saving acts (creation, fall, covenant acts, incarnation, atonement, resurrection, ascension).
 - Relation: Calvin emphasizes historia as the concrete locus of God's saving work; theological ordering (ordo salutis) must not abstract from these acts.
- **Ordo salutis** - logical ordering of salvation's elements (calling, regeneration, faith, justification, sanctification, glorification).
 - Calvin's use: heuristic and pastoral; he resists treating it as a mechanistic sequence divorced from God's single saving work.
- **Efficacious grace / irresistible grace** - grace that effectively achieves its end in the elect; Calvin's language often anticipates later terms.
- **External call** - proclamation and sacraments as means; necessary but insufficient without the Spirit's inward work.
- **Assurance** - confidence grounded in God's promises, Christ's work, and the Spirit's witness, not in subjective introspection alone.
- How this work is used across loci:
 - As a **definition source** for classical Reformed doctrines of calling, regeneration, and union with Christ.
 - As a **polemic and pastoral model** against semi-Pelagian and Roman Catholic accounts of cooperation, and as an exegetical exemplar for anchoring doctrine in gospel history rather than speculative order.
