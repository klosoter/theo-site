### TITLE
John Calvin gives the Reformed churches a Scripture-saturated, God-centered architecture of doctrine in which union with Christ, the duplex gratia, and the sovereignty of God in salvation and worship cohere with a catholic yet reforming vision of the church.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **John Calvin** (1509–1564) ministers in the high **Reformation** amid the consolidation of Lutheran and Reformed identities, especially in **Geneva** and the French-speaking world.
- Formed in the **humanist** milieu of **Erasmus** and trained in law, he stands within the broader **magisterial Reformation** that contests late medieval **Scholastic** theology and papal authority.

- His method is rigorously **Scripture-principled**, treating the **Word of God** as the external means by which the Spirit creates and governs faith and the church.
- He affirms a limited but real use of **reason** and **natural revelation**, yet subordinates all philosophy to the spectacles of **Holy Scripture** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**.
- His theology is pastoral and ecclesial, using a clear **didactic** method in the **Institutes** to catechize magistrates, ministers, and lay believers toward piety and assurance.

- The **Institutes of the Christian Religion** (1536, expanded 1559) systematize Protestant doctrine around **knowledge of God and of ourselves**, union with Christ, and the sovereignty of divine grace.
- His **Commentaries** on nearly every book of **Scripture** (1540s–1560s) embody his conviction that theology must be expository and text-driven, not speculative.
- The **Genevan Catechism** (1541) and **Form of Church Prayers** (1542) shape Reformed **worship** and **catechesis**, especially a Word-and-sacrament pattern governed by the Regulative Principle in seed form.
- His polemical treatises like the **Reply to Sadoleto** (1539) and **Treatises against the Anabaptists and Libertines** articulate a Reformed doctrine of **church**, **sacrament**, and **civil order** over against Rome and radicalism.

- Calvin is decisive for **Scripture and revelation** as the principium of theology, especially his doctrine of the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** and the self-authenticating Word.
- He is central for **soteriology** and **union with Christ**, developing the **duplex gratia** of justification and sanctification, the absolute priority of grace, and unconditional **election**.
- He shapes **ecclesiology and sacraments**, formulating a Reformed account of the visible and invisible **church**, the marks of the church, discipline, and a real spiritual **presence** in the Supper.
- His handling of **providence and culture** frames a Reformed approach to vocation, civil government, and the limits of Christian freedom in worship and life.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to show continuity between **Calvin** and later **Reformed orthodoxy**, not a Calvin-versus-Calvinists narrative, especially on **predestination** and **covenant**.
- You must articulate how **Calvin** is both a catholic and a reforming theologian, affirming classical **Trinitarian** and **Christological** dogma while reshaping late medieval views of grace, church, and Scripture.

- Be ready to compare **Calvin and Augustine** on **grace**, **predestination**, and the church, noting development yet strong continuity.
- Be ready to compare **Calvin and Luther** on **justification**, the **Lord’s Supper**, and the Christian life, as well as **Calvin and the Reformed scholastics** on Scripture and **covenant theology**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**John Calvin**, born in 1509 in **Noyon** in Picardy, comes of age in the ferment of late medieval **Roman Catholicism**, French humanism, and the early **Reformation**. Educated first in the arts, then law in **Orléans** and **Bourges**, he imbibes the **humanist** ad fontes impulse associated with **Erasmus**, especially the study of Scripture and the fathers in the original languages. His early work, the commentary on **Seneca’s De Clementia** in 1532, reveals a legally trained, rhetorically skilled humanist rather than yet a Protestant theologian. Sometime in the mid 1530s, likely 1533–1534, he experiences what he later calls a *sudden conversion* to the evangelical faith, breaking with Rome and aligning with the emerging **Reformed** movement.

Calvin lives and labors primarily in **Geneva**, with a significant exile interlude in **Strasbourg** under **Martin Bucer** from 1538 to 1541. His first arrival in Geneva in 1536, where **Farel** presses him into ministry, plunges him into the concrete problems of church reform: doctrine, liturgy, discipline, and the relation of church and magistrate. Exiled due to resistance to his reforms, he matures under Bucers influence, then returns to Geneva in 1541 to establish a more stable **Reformed** order. Theologically he operates against the background of **Luther**, **Zwingli**, and the controversies with **Rome**, **Anabaptists**, and **Libertines**, as well as intra-Protestant disputes over the Lord’s Supper and predestination.

The driving problem of Calvin’s theology is how the holy and sovereign **God** makes himself savingly known to sinful humans through **Christ**, by the **Spirit**, through **Scripture**, creating a rightly ordered church and a rightly ordered Christian life. His opening line in the **1559 Institutes** that our wisdom consists almost entirely of the knowledge of **God** and of ourselves frames the whole project: the human condition is one of ignorance, idolatry, guilt, and impotence, and the triune God must reveal himself and reconcile sinners through sovereign grace. Against Rome, his problem is a church that eclipses Christ with human traditions, merits, and sacerdotal structures, and against the radicals, a spirituality that severs **Word** and **Spirit** and dissolves the visible church. His theology aims to re-establish the **lordship of Christ** by the Word in doctrine, worship, piety, and polity.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Calvin’s method is rigorously **Scripture-principled**, yet not biblicist, and is shaped by **humanist** exegesis and a strong doctrine of the **Holy Spirit**. In the **Institutes** and his **Commentaries** he affirms a twofold **revelation** of God: first, **general revelation** in creation and providence, which leaves humans without excuse; second, **special revelation** in Scripture that alone suffices to lead us savingly to Christ. Echoing **Psalm 19** and **Romans 1**, he insists that God has sown in human hearts a *sensus divinitatis* and a *semen religionis*, yet due to **sin** this knowledge is always distorted into idolatry. Thus any natural theology is strictly non-salvific and must be corrected and governed by **Holy Scripture**. This is consonant with later **Reformed** confessional teaching that Scripture is necessary, sufficient, and perspicuous in matters of salvation.

For **Calvin**, reason has a ministerial role. He does not despise **philosophy** or civil learning; his legal training and use of **Augustine**, **Chrysostom**, and even certain **Scholastics** show a critical appropriation of tradition. Yet he is clear in the **Institutes** that human reason, though capable in earthly matters, is blind to the right knowledge of God as Father in **Christ**. The famous spectacles image in the Institutes, where **Scripture** is the lens by which we see God rightly in the theater of the world, encapsulates his epistemology: creation and providence are genuinely revelatory, yet only when read through the canon. Here later **Van Til** and **Bavinck** see a profound anticipation of a **Reformed** revelational epistemology.

Central to his method is the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**, the inward witness of the **Holy Spirit**. In the Institutes book 1 he denies that the authority of Scripture rests on the church or rational proofs; rather, Scripture is *autopistos*, self-authenticating as the voice of God, and the Spirit seals this authority in the hearts of believers. Calvin happily uses external evidences such as **prophecy** and **miracles**, but he subordinates them to the Spirits internal persuasion. This is not subjectivism; for Calvin the **Spirit** never speaks apart from the **Word**, and the Word never works efficaciously apart from the Spirit. That dialectic of Word and Spirit becomes standard in **Reformed** orthodoxy and lies behind confessional statements on the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture.

Ecclesially, Calvin reads Scripture within the **church** and the catholic tradition, yet under Scripture as norm. He appeals constantly to **Augustine** and the fathers as witnesses to biblical exegesis against innovations of late medieval **Roman** theology. History is read providentially: God preserves a remnant, and the **Reformation** is a renewal rather than a new church. A Westminster examiner may press that Calvin does not articulate the principium notion in the scholastic vocabulary of **Turretin**; nevertheless, in substance he operates with Scripture as principium cognoscendi, the triune God as principium essendi, and uses **reason** and **experience** ministerially under revelation.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic baseline is that God reveals himself in creation and in Scripture, and that Scripture is the inspired and authoritative canon for faith and life. Calvin develops this in a distinct **Reformed** key by emphasizing both the clarity and the self-authenticating nature of **Scripture** through the **Spirit**. In **Institutes** I.6–10 he argues that while general revelation reveals God as Creator, only Scripture reveals him as Redeemer in **Christ**. Against **Rome**, he denies that the churches later traditions stand alongside Scripture as an independent source; rather, the church is founded on the prophets and apostles and is called to be the obedient hearer of the Word. Calvin stresses the *autopistia* of Scripture, arguing against **Cardinal Sadoleto** and later **Roman** appeals to the churches authority that the authority of Scripture is intrinsic, and that church recognition of the canon is an effect, not a ground, of its divine origin. His doctrine of the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** shapes later Reformed confessions like the **Westminster Confession of Faith** chapter 1, though later scholastics like **Turretin** will refine its epistemological status and its relation to external evidences.

Second, in the locus of **soteriology and union with Christ**, the confessional baseline is justification by faith alone through the imputed righteousness of **Christ**, grounded in Gods eternal decree and applied by the Spirit. Calvin makes decisive contributions here with his robust doctrine of **union with Christ** and the **duplex gratia**, the double grace of justification and sanctification. In **Institutes** book 3 he insists that as long as Christ remains outside us he is of no value to us; salvation consists in being spiritually united to **Christ** by the **Spirit**, from which flow in distinct yet inseparable ways both forensic justification and transformative sanctification. Against **Rome**, he denies any infusion of inherent righteousness as the ground of justification; against **Osiander** he resists grounding justification in the indwelling divine nature of Christ rather than his once-for-all obedience. Calvin also deepens Augustinian **predestination**, especially in Institutes book 3 and sermons on **Ephesians** and **John**, affirming unconditional election and reprobation rooted in Gods sovereign good pleasure. Later debates with **Pighius** and **Bolsec** sharpen his articulation, and while some have charged that later **Reformed scholastics** harden what Calvin keeps pastoral, writers like **Bavinck** and **Muller** show substantial continuity between Calvin and later confessional teaching on election.

Third, in the locus of **Christology and the Lord’s Supper**, the confessional baseline is the Nicene and Chalcedonian doctrine of **Christ**, and a sacramental theology that affirms a real communion with Christ in the Supper without a carnal or local presence. Calvin fully embraces **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon**, using **Athanasius** and **Leo** against both **Arian** and **Nestorian** tendencies. His peculiarity lies not in Christology as such but in how it undergirds his sacramental theology. In the **Institutes** book 4 and his **Short Treatise on the Lord’s Supper** he rejects both **Lutheran** consubstantiation and **Zwinglian** memorialism, arguing that believers truly feed on the body and blood of **Christ** by the **Spirit**. Christ remains bodily in heaven according to his human nature, so the mode of presence is spiritual, not local, and the Spirit lifts believers up to Christ rather than bringing Christ down into the elements. Calvin insists that this is no bare sign; the sacrament truly communicates Christ himself to faith. His polemics with **Westphal** and other Lutherans, and his collegial closeness to **Bucer**, shape this mediating yet distinctively **Reformed** view, which informs later confessional statements on the Supper such as in the **Belgic Confession** and the **Westminster Standards**.

Fourth, in the locus of **church, worship, and culture**, the confessional baseline is that Christ governs his **church** by Word and Spirit, through ordinary means, with a clear distinction between church and state yet a providential use of civil authority. Calvin’s **Institutes** book 4 and the **Ecclesiastical Ordinances** of Geneva give classic **Reformed** shape to this. Against **Rome**, he defines the church by the marks of pure preaching of the Word and right administration of the **sacraments**, with **discipline** as a necessary support. He distinguishes the invisible church of the elect from the visible church that contains hypocrites, yet he insists on the necessity of visible communion under ordained ministry. In **Reply to Sadoleto** he defends the **Reformation** as catholic reform of doctrine and worship according to Scripture. In worship he lays down the seeds of the **Regulative Principle**, insisting that God should not be worshiped according to human imagination but only as he commands in **Scripture**, and he strips away images and unscriptural ceremonies. On culture and civil order, Calvin affirms civil **magistracy** as a good gift of God, advocates for a mutual yet distinct relation of church and state, and offers a doctrine of vocation that sanctifies ordinary work. Later Reformed reflection on **two kingdoms**, Christian liberty, and the place of law in the Christian life owes much to his synthesis.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Later **Reformed orthodoxy** largely receives Calvin as a principal architect rather than as an outlier, though it develops his insights with more explicit scholastic precision. Figures like **Beza**, **Polanus**, and **Turretin** systematize loci where Calvin was more pastoral and occasional, especially **covenant theology** and detailed prolegomena on principia. **Bavinck** insists that Calvin is not a lonely genius but stands within and helps to shape a broader **Reformed** tradition that includes Zurich, Strasbourg, and later Dutch and English theologians. On Scripture and revelation, the **Westminster Confession**’s articulation of the authority of Scripture, the self-evidence of its divinity, and the internal work of the **Spirit** is a direct heir of Calvin’s **testimonium** doctrine. On soteriology, union with **Christ**, justification by faith alone, and unconditional **election** are constants, though later confessions expand federal categories that in Calvin are present but nascent.

A Westminster examiner will want you to resist older twentieth-century narratives that sharply oppose **Calvin** and the later **Calvinists**, especially the claim that Calvin had a warm, Christocentric, and limited doctrine of predestination while later scholastics turned it into a cold central dogma. Recent scholarship by **Richard Muller** and **Paul Helm** shows that Calvin himself puts **predestination** at the service of assurance and piety, not as a speculative centerpiece, and that later Reformed thinkers often follow that pattern. There are, however, points where one must qualify Calvin. On the **Sabbath**, for instance, Calvin sometimes sounds less strictly confessional than later Puritan and Westminster formulations. On **church polity**, his quasi-presbyterial but magistrate-dependent Geneva differs somewhat from later Presbyterian clarity on the spiritual independence of church courts. Yet these are refinements rather than rejections. A Reformed theologian can and must learn from Calvin’s profound integration of **exegesis** and **systematics**, his insistence that every doctrine serve piety and doxology, and his clear subordination of all church authority to the **Word**. At the same time, Reformed orthodoxy will press beyond him in explicit **covenant theology**, sacramental precision, and principial method, not as a betrayal but as a legitimate maturation of his project.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, a safe opening line is that **John Calvin** is the principal architect of classic **Reformed** theology, whose **Institutes** give a Scripture-saturated and pastorally oriented synthesis of doctrine ordered around the knowledge of God and ourselves. It is also safe to say that Calvin unites **Augustinian** sovereignty of grace with a strong doctrine of **Scripture** and church, and that his theology aims at piety and assurance rather than speculation. You can safely describe his view of Scripture using the language of the **self-authenticating Word** and the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**, and to speak of his soteriology in terms of **union with Christ** and the **duplex gratia** of justification and sanctification. These formulations reassure a Westminster examiner that you have internalized distinctively Reformed categories rather than generic Protestant slogans.

You must avoid or qualify certain phrases. You should not oppose **Calvin** to the **Reformed scholastics** by saying that later orthodoxy betrayed his warm, Christ-centered theology with cold logic, since this plays into an outdated historiography that a Westminster committee will distrust. You should not suggest that Calvin denies **reprobation** or that predestination is merely a marginal theme. When speaking of natural theology, avoid saying that Calvin rejects **natural revelation** or reason; instead, note that he affirms a true though non-salvific knowledge of God in creation that sin always corrupts, so he subordinates it to **Scripture** and **Spirit**. Avoid language that Calvin is essentially **Lutheran** on the Supper, or that he is simply a middle way between Luther and Zwingli; instead, stress his positive **Reformed** doctrine of real spiritual presence. Also take care with **two kingdoms** language; Calvin is not an Erastian, yet he does give civil magistrates a significant role in church life, so you should distinguish his position from both medieval papalism and modern separationism.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings about Calvin. Students may think Calvin is only about **predestination**, so be ready to show how his entire system is organized not around the decree but around **knowledge of God**, **Scripture**, and union with **Christ**. Others may caricature him as anti-sacramental; you should highlight his strong doctrine of **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** as true means of grace and his insistence on weekly communion in Geneva. Some may think Calvin is indifferent to the **church**, but you should point to Institutes book 4 and his strenuous work on church discipline, polity, and catechesis. Conversely, do not romanticize him as a proto-democrat; his views on magistracy, discipline, and persecution of heresy such as the case of **Servetus** require sober acknowledgment. A Westminster examiner will appreciate a candid yet confessional reading that honors Calvin’s profound contributions while recognizing that the **Reformed** tradition did not freeze with him but grew through and beyond him in a way largely faithful to his own instincts.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, **John Calvin** is to be embraced as a foundational **Reformed** theologian whose doctrines of **Scripture**, **God**, **Christ**, and **salvation** are substantially in line with later confessional orthodoxy and whose emphases on the self-authenticating Word, the internal testimony of the Spirit, union with Christ, and the duplex gratia remain paradigmatic. We affirm his robust **Trinitarian** and **Christological** commitments, his Augustinian account of sin and sovereign grace, his high view of the church and the means of grace, and his insistence that theology aims at piety and the glory of God. We must, however, deny any attempt to use Calvin against the **Reformed confessions**, whether on predestination, covenant theology, or worship, and we must reject historiographical schemes that pit Calvin’s Christocentricity against the scholastic precision of later orthodoxy. If asked where we land, we would say that we stand with **Calvin** as received and clarified by the **Reformed confessions**, grateful for his exegetical brilliance and pastoral theology, while recognizing that the mature Westminster standards represent not a departure from but a faithful development of his biblical vision.
