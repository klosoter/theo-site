### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Craig L. Blomberg, born 1955, emerged within the ferment of late twentieth-century **evangelicalism**, where **inerrancy** and the **historical Jesus** came to define public debate. Trained at **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School** under **D. A. Carson** and completing a PhD in New Testament at **Aberdeen** under **I. Howard Marshall** in 1982, he absorbed a distinctive blend of **exegetical rigor** and **critical engagement**. His early teaching at Palm Beach Atlantic College and long tenure at **Denver Seminary**, beginning 1986, unfolded against the rise of the **Jesus Seminar**, the populist skepticism of **Bart D. Ehrman**, and the retrieval of **ancient historiography** in Gospel studies. Blomberg consciously forged an **evangelical critical realism** that rejects both naive biblicism and corrosive skepticism, insisting that responsible **historical-grammatical exegesis** welcomes **source**, **form**, and **redaction criticism** while refusing their naturalistic reduction. The controlling aim is the **historical reliability of the New Testament**, secured through genre-sensitive reading and a cumulative case that grants the **Gospels** the status of serious ancient **bioi** within a providential account of **revelation**.

At the methodological level, Blomberg advances a chastened confidence in the **criteria of authenticity** and in **multiple attestation**, **coherence**, and **embarrassment**, yet he resists treating these tools as rigid algorithms. He stresses *ipsissima vox* over *ipsissima verba*, arguing that ancient authors paraphrased responsibly and employed accepted **compositional devices** such as conflation, telescoping, and thematic arrangement. His approach to **inerrancy**, aligned with the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy**, is thoroughly **genre** and **convention** sensitive. Apparent divergences are measured against the flexible truth-telling norms of **Greco-Roman historiography** rather than anachronistic modern reportage. The result is a moderate and confident hermeneutic in which **miracle**, **resurrection**, and **prophecy** are live options within a coherent **historical** narrative shaped by Israel’s **eschatological** hopes.

#### 2. The reliability project: Gospels, John, and the New Testament
Blomberg’s signature achievement begins with **The Historical Reliability of the Gospels**, 1991, revised 2007 and again in an expanded form in 2022. Here he confronts **radical form-critical** skepticism and the **Jesus Seminar** through a careful survey of **manuscripts**, **archaeology**, **non-Christian witnesses**, and the internal plausibility of the **Gospel traditions**. He contends that the **Synoptic Gospels** represent stable, community-vetted memories shaped by eyewitness testimony and reliable oral transmission, anticipating later emphases on **eyewitnesses** found in **Richard Bauckham**. The work devotes sustained attention to alleged contradictions, proposing **complementary harmonizations** that honor both **redactional** distinctiveness and a common core. Against charges of tendentiousness in **John**, **The Historical Reliability of John’s Gospel**, 2001, argues that the Fourth Gospel preserves independent access to **historical memory**, with distinctive **theological interpretation** that does not contravene facticity. The broader **The Historical Reliability of the New Testament**, 2016, extends the defense to **Acts**, **Pauline letters**, and **Revelation**, contesting claims of pervasive pseudonymity and aligning **canon** with authentic apostolic witness.

A centerpiece of this reliability project is Blomberg’s insistence that **ancient biography** accommodated paraphrase, compression, and topical reordering without deceit. He explains apparent discrepancies in **chronology**, **speech reports**, and **narrative detail** by reference to the expectations of first-century readers schooled by **Thucydides**, **Polybius**, and **Plutarch**. His sympathetic interaction with **Michael Licona** on **Greco-Roman compositional devices** generated controversy with **Norman Geisler**, which Blomberg addresses in **Can We Still Believe the Bible**, 2014. He argues that a confessionally robust **inerrancy** must be elastic enough to incorporate these literary practices. The same volume offers robust replies to **textual criticism** scare tactics, contending with **Bart D. Ehrman** that New Testament variants are numerous but theologically insignificant, supported by the work of **Daniel Wallace** and the stability of the **manuscript tradition**. The result is a cumulative case that unites **apologetics** and **exegesis**, with genre-aware realism.

#### 3. Jesus and the parables, synoptic method, and hermeneutics
In **Interpreting the Parables**, 1990, revised and expanded 2012, and in **Jesus and the Gospels**, 1997, revised 2009, Blomberg extends his method to the heart of **Jesus’ teaching**. He resists the tendency to allegorize every detail while also criticizing an oversimplified single-point rule, arguing instead for a constrained plurality where **parables** typically carry one main point per major character. The interpretive horizon is **kingdom of God** proclamation with an **already and not yet** eschatology that structures ethics, mission, and ecclesial identity. His introduction to the **Synoptic Problem** shows careful sympathy for **Markan priority** and the **Two-Source Hypothesis**, while highlighting the fragility of overly confident reconstructions of **Q**. He often argues for moderate dating and cautions against harmonistic overreach that ignores **redactional aims**.

With **Contagious Holiness**, 2005, on Jesus’ meals with sinners, Blomberg exemplifies socio-historical sensitivity deployed to theological ends. In **A Handbook of New Testament Exegesis**, 2010, with **Jennifer F. Markley**, he systematizes a pedagogical pathway that moves from **textual criticism**, through **literary and discourse analysis**, to **biblical theology** and **application**. The tools are anchored in **historical-grammatical** method but open to refined **narrative** and **social-scientific** insights. Across these volumes his interpretive stance aims to refuse both **fundamentalist prooftexting** and **postcritical suspicion**, seeking instead a confessional reading that plays fair with the data and receives **Scripture** as simultaneously **historical** and **theological** witness.

#### 4. Pauline studies, Acts to Revelation, and canonical scope
Although best known for Gospel studies, Blomberg’s **From Pentecost to Patmos**, 2006, second edition 2021, furnishes introductions to **Acts** through **Revelation** that complement his earlier **Jesus and the Gospels**. He argues for the historical verisimilitude of **Acts**, drawing on **Colin Hemer** and subsequent confirmations of local knowledge, and he provides pastoral-theological trajectories for **Pauline ethics**, **justification**, and **ecclesiology**. His **NIV Application Commentary** on **1 Corinthians**, 1994, bridges careful exegesis and contemporary application, highlighting issues such as **sexual ethics**, **spiritual gifts**, and **Christian freedom** under the lordship of **Christ**. These works reveal a consistent commitment to reading the New Testament as diverse witnesses within a coherent **canonical theology**, where **redemptive history** provides the unifying arc from **Israel** to **church**, and where **eschatology** orders Christian praxis.

The canonical scope also informs his judgments on **pseudonymity** and **authorship**. Blomberg is skeptical of the routine assignment of letters like **Ephesians** or **Pastorals** to pseudonymous authors, arguing that ancient standards of **truthfulness** and the early church’s **canonical criteria** make widespread pseudonymity implausible. He prefers explanations involving **amanuenses**, **co-authorship**, and occasion-specific vocabularies. This posture preserves both the **integrity of apostolic witness** and the realistic texture of the **New Testament documents** as occasional writings to real communities.

#### 5. Wealth, possessions, and kingdom economics
Blomberg’s most distinctive contribution in **biblical theology** outside historical reliability is his sustained treatment of wealth in **Neither Poverty nor Riches**, 1999, and **Christians in an Age of Wealth**, 2013. He surveys **Torah**, **Wisdom**, **Prophets**, **Gospels**, **Acts**, and **Paul**, concluding that Scripture resists both **ascetic absolutism** and **prosperity theology**. The controlling categories are **stewardship**, **generous justice**, and **kingdom priorities**. He foregrounds the **Jubilee** and **Sabbath economics** of the Old Testament, the **kingdom ethic** of Jesus in **Luke-Acts**, and the Pauline call to **equitable relief** in **2 Corinthians 8 to 9**. The thesis is that God entrusts resources to be leveraged for **mission**, **mercy**, and **worship**, while warning against idolatrous **mammon**.

Blomberg operationalizes these claims through concrete proposals on **tithing**, **graduated giving**, and **global poverty**, all under an **already and not yet** eschatological frame that resists utopianism. He argues that the New Testament commends **voluntary generosity** catalyzed by the **gospel**, not coerced redistribution, while also indicting structural injustice. In doing so he positions evangelical ethics as simultaneously compassionate and prudent, indebted to **Reformation stewardship** and open to **public engagement** for the common good.

#### 6. Scripture, canon, and public apologetics
The capstone of Blomberg’s public-facing apologetic on Scripture is **Can We Still Believe the Bible**, 2014. Here he addresses six contested questions concerning **textual variants**, **canon formation**, **translations**, **archaeology**, **contradictions**, and **miracles**. He disputes sensationalist claims about hundreds of thousands of changes by showing that the vast majority are spelling or stylistic, with no impact on **doctrine**. He explains the formation of the **Old Testament** and **New Testament** canons in terms of **recognition** rather than invention, guided by apostolicity, orthodoxy, and catholic reception. On translations he defends both **formal equivalence** and **dynamic equivalence** as legitimate strategies guided by linguistic science and missional aims.

The same volume engages critics like **Bart D. Ehrman** and responds to conservative polemics represented by **Norman Geisler**, especially regarding **Michael Licona** and apocalyptic features in **Matthew 27**. Blomberg calls for a principled **inerrancy** that honors **ancient genre conventions**, reinforcing his appeal to **Greco-Roman historiography** and *ipsissima vox*. His later **Can We Still Believe in God**, 2020, broadens the scope to **theism**, **problem of evil**, **religious pluralism**, and **science**, with an even-tempered apologetic that refuses strawman caricatures. This public voice exemplifies a pastoral-apologetic vocation that seeks to shore up evangelical confidence without retreating from the mainstream of **biblical scholarship**.

#### 7. Gender, church order, and evangelical unity
In the contested arena of gender and ministry, Blomberg contributed to **Two Views on Women in Ministry**, 2001, second edition 2005, alongside **Thomas R. Schreiner**, **Linda Belleville**, and **Craig Keener**. He articulates a nuanced or limited **complementarianism**, arguing from **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 14** for male eldership while affirming broad participation of women in **teaching**, **prophecy**, and **leadership** under scriptural parameters. His approach features rigorous **exegetical analysis** of key texts, careful attention to **Greco-Roman household codes**, and willingness to revisit traditional applications in light of **redemptive-historical trajectories**. The argumentative style is consensual and irenic, committed to evangelical unity while seeking faithfulness to **canonical patterns**.

This ecclesial work dovetails with his broader **ethical** and **hermeneutical** commitments. He reads prohibitions as contextually embedded yet theologically principled, and he resists both hard-edged cultural traditionalism and revisionist readings that dissolve **apostolic authority**. The result is a pastoral exegesis that seeks to preserve the complementarity of gifts while foregrounding the primacy of **mission** and **edification** in the gathered **church**.

#### 8. Eschatology, historical premillennialism, and evangelical horizons
Blomberg’s eschatological posture comes into focus with his co-edited volume **A Case for Historic Premillennialism**, 2009, with **Sung Wook Chung**. He distances historic **premillennialism** from pop **dispensationalism**, arguing that a post-tribulational, Christocentric millennium coheres with **Revelation 20** read within **canonical eschatology**. His essays and editorial vision exhibit the same moderate-exegetical ethos that marks his work elsewhere, seeking ground between **amillennial** and **dispensational** poles and deploying **already and not yet** categories to guard against both triumphalism and despair. This stance reinforces his consistent emphasis on the public plausibility and moral urgency of **Christian hope**.

Eschatology also functions as a hermeneutical guide in his ethics of **wealth**, his view of **miracles** as signs of the inaugurated **kingdom**, and his understanding of mission in **Acts**. The practical horizon of hope impacts his advocacy for **generosity**, **holiness**, and **witness**, underscoring that historical reliability and doctrinal coherence serve the living obedience of the church.

#### 9. Influence, teaching, and scholarly networks
Across four decades at **Denver Seminary**, Blomberg mentored generations of evangelical scholars and pastors, integrating **rigorous exegesis** with churchly application. He contributed to translation and commentary enterprises, including the **New American Commentary** on **Matthew**, 1992, and the **NIV Application Commentary** on **1 Corinthians**, 1994, modeling how **commentary** can bridge **academic** and **pastoral** domains. He has been a frequent interlocutor with **D. A. Carson**, **Darrell Bock**, **Craig Keener**, and **Richard Bauckham**, and a public critic of the **Jesus Seminar**, **John Dominic Crossan**, and **Marcus Borg**. His reliability volumes, especially in 1991, 2001, 2016, and 2022, remain standard evangelical responses to **skeptical** treatments of the **New Testament**.

Reception of his work is marked by appreciable breadth. Many evangelicals have adopted his **genre-sensitive inerrancy** and *ipsissima vox* emphasis. His defense of **Licona** and his openness to **Greco-Roman compositional devices** have sparked intra-evangelical debates, yet have also catalyzed a more historically literate apologetic. In public, he exemplifies civility without capitulation, producing a body of work that grounds confidence in **Scripture** with historical and theological dexterity.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a confessional **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Blomberg’s corpus offers significant strengths and identifiable tensions. Positively, his defense of the **historical reliability of the Gospels** and the **New Testament** serves the church’s confession of **Scripture’s veracity**, his **genre-sensitive inerrancy** coheres with classic doctrines of **accommodation**, and his **redemptive-historical** instincts in parables, Acts, and ethics resonate with **Geerhardus Vos** on the unfolding **kingdom of God**. His theology of **wealth and stewardship** aligns with Reformed **diaconal theology** and a catholic concern for the poor. Yet a Van Tilian critique notes that his **critical realism** sometimes leans on putatively neutral **historical method** as a ground for epistemic confidence. The Reformed tradition would reassert **Scripture’s self-attestation**, the **Spirit’s internal testimony**, and the **covenantal** frame of knowledge as principia, using history as corroboration rather than foundation. His acceptance of **Greco-Roman compositional devices** is compatible with inerrancy rightly defined, yet calls for tight doctrinal guardrails to avoid incremental erosion under skeptical pressure. His limited **complementarianism** will find broad sympathy at Westminster, though specific exegeses of **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 14** may be queried regarding created order and ecclesial office. Finally, his **historic premillennialism** diverges from classical Reformed **amillennialism**, suggesting an area for continued intramural conversation about the structure of **covenant history** and the nature of **Christian hope**. In sum, Blomberg is a reliable ally for a historically grounded and confessionally serious doctrine of **Scripture**, best received when nested within Reformed principia that keep **revelation**, not autonomous history, as ultimate court of appeal.
