### TITLE
Karl Barth is the towering twentieth‑century dogmatician whose Christocentric reconstruction of all theology both recalled the church from liberalism to the Word of God and simultaneously displaced Reformed orthodoxy on Scripture, election, and the atonement.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Karl Barth** (1886–1968) emerged from late nineteenth‑century **liberal Protestantism** in Germany and Switzerland and reacted against the legacy of **Schleiermacher** and **Ritschl**.
- His mature work develops across the crisis of **World War I**, the interwar **Dialectical Theology** movement, and the struggle with **National Socialism** in the 1930s.

- Methodologically **Barth** advances a radically **Christocentric** and **revelation‑centered** approach that rejects natural theology and religion as starting points.
- He treats **revelation** as a free event of Gods self‑speaking in **Jesus Christ**, rendered in the witness of **Scripture** and the proclamation of the **church**.
- His dialectical method in **Römerbrief** and the early **Kirchliche Dogmatik** deploys sharp **Nein/Ja** contrasts to expose both human religion and metaphysics as incapable of reaching God.

- In the second **Römerbrief** (1919/1922) Barth uses apocalyptic **Romans** exegesis to oppose liberal historicism with the radical *ganz Andere* of God.
- In **Fides Quaerens Intellectum** (1931) he re‑reads **Anselm** as a model of faith seeking understanding grounded in Gods self‑revelation.
- In **Church Dogmatics** I/1–I/2 (1932–38) he articulates his doctrine of **revelation** and **Scripture** as the threefold Word of God.
- In **Church Dogmatics** II/2 (1942) he offers his famous revision of **election** and **reprobation** in terms of **Jesus Christ** as the electing God and elected man.

- Barth is decisive for doctrines of **revelation and Scripture**, redefining inspiration and inerrancy through the dynamic concept of the threefold **Word**.
- He is central for modern **Trinity and Christology**, especially the relation of the **incarnation** to election and the person and work of **Christ**.
- He significantly reshapes **election, atonement, and grace**, and offers a distinctive theology of **church and culture** in opposition to **natural theology**.
- His stance in the **Barmen Declaration** and his ecclesial politics shape ongoing debates about **church, state, and ideology**.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to contrast **Barth** with classic **Reformed confessionalism** on **Scripture**, **election**, and **atonement** while acknowledging his critique of liberalism.
- You must be able to affirm his stress on **Gods freedom and Christocentrism** yet clearly reject his views on **biblical authority** and his near‑**universalism**.

- Be ready to compare **Schleiermacher vs Barth** on the locus of **revelation** and the problem of religion.
- Be ready to compare **Barth vs Bavinck** or **Calvin** on **election and Scripture**, and **Barth vs Van Til** on **revelation and natural theology**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Karl Barth was born in 1886 in Basel, trained under leading German liberals such as **Harnack** and **Herrmann**, and served as a pastor in **Safenwil** during the years leading up to **World War I**. Immersed in the culture of **Ritschlian** moral theology and **Schleiermacherian** religion of feeling, he initially preached a softened ethical gospel shaped by modern historicism. The outbreak of the war in 1914, and especially the pro‑war **Manifesto of the Ninety‑Three** signed by his former teachers, shattered his confidence in liberal theology as an ally of the kingdom of God. For Barth the catastrophe exposed how a theology grounded in culture, history, and religious consciousness could be co‑opted by **nationalism** and ideology rather than stand prophetically under the **Word of God**.

In this crisis Barth turned back to **Scripture**, especially the Epistle to the **Romans**, and rediscovered the radical otherness of Gods righteousness and grace. The early editions of his **Römerbrief** in 1919 and 1922 announced what came to be called **Dialectical Theology**, a movement centered in figures like **Brunner**, **Gogarten**, and **Thurneysen** that set up a stark dialectic between God and humanity, revelation and religion, grace and sin. Barth took up a professorship in **Göttingen** in 1921 and then in **Münster** and **Bonn**, where he deepened his engagement with **Reformed orthodoxy**, **Anselm**, and the **church fathers**. His driving problem became how to proclaim the living God who speaks anew in **Jesus Christ** without surrendering theology to modern culture, philosophy, or religious experience.

This concern intensified under the rise of **National Socialism**, when Barth played a central role in drafting the **Barmen Declaration** of 1934, which confessed Jesus Christ as the one Word of God against the false doctrine of the **German Christians** and the Führer principle. For Barth the political crisis made explicit the underlying dogmatic issue: whether **revelation** is a free act of God in Christ that judges all human words, or whether theology can be grounded in some stable human capacity such as reason, culture, or national destiny. His life work in the **Church Dogmatics** is thus driven by a single problem: how to let the **self‑revelation of the triune God in Christ** be the sole principle of theology and thereby re‑found dogmatics beyond both liberalism and traditional scholasticism.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Barth famously insists in **Church Dogmatics I/1** that Christian dogmatics begins with Gods self‑revelation in **Jesus Christ** and nowhere else. He rejects both a **natural theology** that would ascend from creation to God by way of an *analogia entis* and a subjectivist theology that would start from religious consciousness, experience, or culture. Revelation for Barth is a sovereign event: God speaks, God is heard, God is known, in the one history of **Jesus Christ**, mediated by **Scripture** and **preaching**. In **Fides Quaerens Intellectum** he interprets **Anselm** as a paradigm of this method: faith, given by Gods Word, seeks understanding on the basis of that same Word, never on the basis of neutral reason. Theology is therefore for Barth an act of **critical reflection** on the content of the **churchs proclamation**, testing whether it conforms to the Word that God speaks.

In setting out this method Barth develops his influential doctrine of the **threefold Word of God**. In **CD I/1** he distinguishes the eternal **Word** who is Jesus Christ, the written **Word** that is Holy Scripture, and the proclaimed **Word** that is church preaching. All three are truly the Word of God, yet Scripture and proclamation are such only as God freely uses them to bear witness to Christ. This leads Barth to speak of **Scripture** as a fallible human witness that becomes Gods Word in the event of divine self‑attestation. He strongly resists any notion of a static **inerrant text** that would be divine in itself, since that, in his judgment, would subject God to human control and collapse revelation into a religious object. His insistence on the event‑character of revelation and the dynamic nature of the biblical witness marks a sharp tension with the **Reformed confessional** doctrine of verbal inspiration and the abiding authority of the canonical text.

Barth also reconfigures the roles of **reason, experience, and church history** in theology. Reason is not autonomous; it is a creaturely instrument placed under the judgment and renewal of **revelation**. Experience is never foundational, as in **Schleiermacher**, but is always an echo or effect of Gods prior speech in Christ. The history of **doctrine and confessions** is significant as the fallible but privileged history of the churchs attempt to bear witness to the gospel. Thus Barth engages deeply with **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and **Luther**, often retrieving classical formulations such as **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon**, yet he insists that even the creeds stand under the ongoing critique of the living **Word of God**. This gives his method a distinctly dynamic and provisional character which, while formally affirming dogmatic norms, in practice relativizes all human formulations, including confessions cherished by the **Reformed** tradition.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline holds that Gods special revelation is inscripturated in the **Holy Scriptures**, which are inspired, inerrant, and sufficient, and that preaching is authoritative only as it faithfully expounds this written Word. Barth, by contrast, relocates revelation primarily in the person and history of **Jesus Christ** and only secondarily in **Scripture** and **proclamation** as witnesses. In **CD I/1** and **CD I/2** he argues that the Bible is a human document, containing errors and contradictions, yet uniquely commissioned as the normative witness to Gods revelation in Christ. Scripture is thus the **Word of God** in a derivative and eventful sense; it becomes Gods Word as the Spirit uses it to confront us with Christ. Barth opposes the **Princeton** doctrine of inerrancy, represented by **Warfield**, as an illegitimate objectification of revelation. His interlocutor **Emil Brunner** in the famous **Nein!** debate highlights how both men reject classic natural theology yet diverge over the remaining capacity of human nature to receive revelation, which for Barth is entirely determined by Gods free act, not by any inherent *Anknüpfungspunkt*.

Second, in the doctrine of the **Trinity and Christology**, the Reformed confessions affirm one simple divine essence in three persons and the **incarnation** of the eternal Son as true God and true man, with two natures united in one person without confusion. Barth strongly reaffirms the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** tradition in **CD I/1** and **CD I/2**, insisting on the **homoousios** of the Son with the Father and the full deity and humanity of Jesus Christ. Yet he radicalizes the Christological center by treating all divine attributes through the lens of the incarnate **Jesus**, so that election, revelation, and even the being of God are determined in and by Christ. In **CD II/1** he speaks of Gods being in act, so that the eternal Trinity is known only in the self‑revelation of Father, Son, and Spirit in the history of salvation. His opponents here are not only **Arian** or liberal Christologies but also some classical **scholastic** expositions, which he regards as too static or abstract. This yields a powerful, worship‑evoking doctrine of the **triune God** but introduces tension with classical **divine simplicity** and the conviction that God would be fully triune and perfect even without the economy of redemption.

Third, in the locus of **election, atonement, and grace**, the Reformed baseline confesses unconditional election of some sinners to salvation and reprobation of others to perdition in **Christ**, grounded in Gods sovereign good pleasure, with the **atonement** understood as Christ bearing the penalty due to the elect alone. In **CD II/2** Barth offers his most famous and controversial revision. He identifies **Jesus Christ** as both the electing God and elected man, so that election is primarily Gods gracious self‑determination to be God for humanity in Christ. On this basis Barth redefines **reprobation** as Gods gracious self‑rejection borne by Christ in our place. Election is no longer a decree that divides humanity into two classes prior to Christ; it is a decision in Christ that includes all humanity as the object of divine favor. While Barth denies being a universalist, he speaks of a universal **objective reconciliation** of all in Christ in **CD IV/1–3**, with the subjective realization left in a kind of hopeful suspense. Against classic **Supralapsarian** or **Infralapsarian** schemes represented by **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and later **Bavinck**, Barth thus displaces the decretal particularism of Reformed orthodoxy with a Christocentric, near‑universalist conception of grace.

Fourth, in the area of **church, culture, and natural theology**, Reformed orthodoxy holds that the church is the visible assembly of the elect gathered by the Word and sacraments, and that there is a real though limited **natural revelation** of God in creation that leaves humanity without excuse. Barth, particularly in his **Nein!** to **Brunner** in 1934 and his role in the **Barmen Declaration**, rejects any positive role for **natural theology** as a basis for knowledge of God. For him such appeals to creation and reason had underwritten the capitulation of German Protestantism to **Nazism**. The church in **CD IV/1–2** is instead the community gathered where God speaks afresh in **proclamation**; it exists wherever Christ is truly present in the event of the Word, not as an institution with clear visible boundaries defined by sacramental order. Barth affirms a strong **Christ against culture** stance at critical moments, yet later nuances this into a theology of **witness** in public life. His opponents include not only **Brunner** but also **Roman Catholic** advocates of the *analogia entis* and Protestant natural theologians like **Brunner** in his more positive moods, while his influence shapes later political and liberation theologies that see in his **Barmen** stance a model for resistance.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Barth stands in a paradoxical relation to **Reformed orthodoxy**. On the one hand, he consciously retrieves **Calvin**, **Zwingli**, and the **Reformed confessions**, and he often sounds like a modern **Bavinck** in his insistence that all theology must be grounded in the self‑attesting Word of the **triune God**. In rejecting **Schleiermacher** and liberal historicism, he recovers central dogmatic topics such as **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **atonement**, and he restores confidence in dogmatics as a disciplined enterprise. Many Reformed thinkers, including **Torrance** and later some strands of evangelical theology, have drawn from Barth a renewed sense of the centrality of **Christ** and the primacy of divine grace.

On the other hand, major Reformed voices such as **Van Til**, **Machen**, and later **John Murray** sharply criticize Barth as a new modernism. **Van Til** in particular argues that Barths dialectical method and his doctrine of the **Word of God** represent a sophisticated form of **Kantian** or **idealistic** thought in which God never truly speaks in inerrant propositions, so that the historical Christ and the biblical text are never fully identical with Gods self‑communication. From a Westminster standpoint at least two objections are non‑negotiable. First, Barths doctrine of **Scripture** in **CD I/2**, which affirms real error and fallibility in the biblical text and treats inspiration as an event rather than a property of the text, stands in direct conflict with the **Westminster Confession** on biblical authority and inerrancy. Second, his doctrine of **election** and the virtually universal scope of reconciliation in **CD II/2** and **CD IV** undermine the particularistic structure of covenant, election, and atonement set forth in classic **Reformed** soteriology.

Yet there are also points where a Reformed theologian can learn fruitfully from Barth. His relentless insistence on the **God‑centeredness** of theology, the sovereign freedom of God in **revelation and grace**, and the centrality of **Jesus Christ** as the content and criterion of doctrine can function as a salutary critique of both liberal and conservative domestications of God. His role in the **Barmen Declaration** models a confessional resistance to idolatrous state ideologies that a Reformed ecclesiology of the **church** under the Word can affirm. Moreover, his retrieval of the **Trinity** and **Christology** as central dogmatic loci has helped rescue these doctrines from marginalization, even if his specific formulations require careful critique and correction by the standards of **classical theism** and Reformed confessions.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam setting, it is safe to open by saying that **Karl Barth** is the most influential twentieth‑century Protestant dogmatician who sought to re‑found theology on the self‑revelation of the **triune God in Jesus Christ** over against both liberalism and natural theology. Another safe sentence is that Barth recentered modern theology on **Christ**, **Scripture**, and the **Trinity**, though he did so in ways that depart significantly from classical Reformed orthodoxy on Scripture, election, and the atonement. These lines signal both appreciation and critical distance, which a Westminster examiner will appreciate.

You must avoid unqualified praise such as calling **Barth** simply a defender of orthodoxy or saying that he restored a fully **Reformed** doctrine of grace. Phrases such as **universalism**, **vicarious humanity**, or *analogia entis* require careful handling. You should not casually label Barth a universalist, since he explicitly rejects dogmatic universalism in **CD II/2**, yet you should say that his doctrine of **election and reconciliation** tends strongly in a universalist direction and that from a Reformed standpoint this is a serious concern. When speaking of his rejection of the *analogia entis* in his famous remark that it is an invention of the **Antichrist**, you should add that he thereby also rejects the classic **Reformed** affirmation of a true though analogical **knowledge of God from creation**, going beyond the **Westminster Confession** at this point.

Students are often tripped up by two misunderstandings that examiners may exploit. First, some treat Barth as simply the opposite of **Schleiermacher**, as if he eliminated all role for human subjectivity, while in fact Barth still speaks of faith, encounter, and event in ways that resonate with certain **existentialist** currents. You should be ready to say that he preserves a strong event character to **revelation** and does not return to a purely scholastic propositionalism. Second, others imagine that Barth is a straightforward ally for **evangelical** inerrancy and penal substitution just because he criticizes **liberalism**. You must be clear that he denies the classic **inerrancy** of Scripture, that he reconfigures **atonement** primarily as the history of Christs humiliation and exaltation in which all humanity is judged and reconciled, and that he relativizes confessions and ecclesial structures more than the **Reformed** tradition would allow. Examiners may also probe your grasp of **Van Til vs Barth**; you should be able to say that Van Til charges Barth with a dialectical theology where God and man are in an ultimate tension such that revelation is never identical with clear, authoritative human words, a critique that underscores Westminster concerns about Barths doctrine of **Scripture**.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective one should affirm in **Karl Barth** his uncompromising insistence that theology begins and ends with the self‑revelation of the **triune God in Jesus Christ**, his rejection of liberal reductions of the gospel to ethics or experience, and his courageous ecclesial stand in the **Barmen Declaration** as an example of the church under the Word resisting idolatrous states. Yet one must firmly deny his event‑based doctrine of **Scripture** that allows for real error in the biblical text, his effective denial of a stable natural revelation grounded in the *imago Dei*, his nearly universalist revision of **election** and the atonement in **CD II/2** and **CD IV**, and his tendency to treat all doctrinal formulations, including confessions, as endlessly revisable under an open‑ended Word. If asked where I land, I would say that Barth is a providentially important, deeply learned yet deeply flawed modern interlocutor who can sharpen Reformed theology on the **Christocentricity** and freedom of God, but whose dogmatic system as a whole cannot be adopted within a confessional **Reformed** framework without surrendering core commitments on Scripture, election, and the particularity of redeeming grace.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Karl Barth** is the twentieth‑century Protestant dogmatician who sought to re‑found theology on the self‑revelation of the **triune God in Jesus Christ** against both liberalism and natural theology.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1886 in **Basel**, converted from liberalism after **World War I**, and taught in **Göttingen**, **Münster**, **Bonn**, and finally **Basel** until his death in 1968.
- The second **Römerbrief** (1919/1922) announced his **Dialectical Theology** with an apocalyptic reading of **Romans** against liberal historicism.
- **Church Dogmatics** I–IV (1932–1967) is his unfinished magnum opus, with key volumes on **revelation** (I/1–2) and **election** (II/2).

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Barth grounds all theology in Gods free **revelation** in **Jesus Christ**, rejecting both **natural theology** and religious experience as starting points.
- He articulates a **threefold Word of God** (Christ, **Scripture**, preaching) where the Bible is a fallible human witness that becomes Gods Word in the event of divine self‑attestation.
- He treats **reason, experience, and church history** as subordinated and continually judged by the living **Word of God** rather than as neutral foundations.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In **CD I/1–2** Barth relocates **revelation** in the person of Christ and treats **Scripture** as a human text that God sovereignly uses as his Word.
- In **CD II/1** he develops a dynamic doctrine of the **Trinity**, emphasizing Gods being in act and reading all attributes through the incarnate **Jesus**.
- In **CD II/2** he redefines **election** so that Jesus Christ is both electing God and elected man, with reprobation borne by Christ himself.
- In **CD IV/1–3** he expounds the **atonement** as the history of Christs humiliation and exaltation that entails a universal objective reconciliation in **Christ**.
- Through the **Barmen Declaration** and his **Nein!** to **Brunner**, he rejects **natural theology** and models a church standing under the one **Word of God** against ideology.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- His event‑based doctrine of **Scripture** and denial of inerrancy conflict with the **Westminster Confession** on biblical authority.
- His universalizing doctrine of **election and reconciliation** in **CD II/2** undermines classic **Reformed** particularism in grace and atonement.
- His rejection of **natural theology** goes beyond the Reformed affirmation of **general revelation** in creation and conscience.
- His dynamic, Christocentric account of Gods being in act raises questions about **divine simplicity** and the independence of God apart from the economy.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Schleiermacher vs Barth on revelation**: religious experience and feeling versus Gods sovereign Word in **Christ**.
- **Barth vs Bavinck on election**: Christ as the locus of a universalizing election versus a decree with definite, particular objects.
- **Aquinas and Reformed scholastics vs Barth on natural theology**: *analogia entis* and true knowledge from creation versus Barths **Nein!** to natural theology.
- **Van Til vs Barth on Scripture and revelation**: self‑attesting, inerrant **Word of God** in propositional form versus dynamic, fallible biblical witness that becomes Word in event.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Barth is a monumental and often salutary critic of liberalism who reinvigorates **Trinity** and **Christology**, yet his doctrines of **Scripture**, **election**, and **atonement** ultimately place his system outside the bounds of confessional Reformed theology.
