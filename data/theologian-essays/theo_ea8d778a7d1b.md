### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andrew Purves emerges as a late twentieth-century **Reformed** theologian whose distinctive contribution is to reorder pastoral practice around **Christology**, particularly the **ascension and session** of Jesus Christ. Trained in the **Scottish Reformed** milieu and serving for decades at **Pittsburgh Theological Seminary** as the Hugh Thomson Kerr Professor of **Pastoral Theology**, Purves writes against the background of a North American ministry culture beset by **therapeutic** individualism, bureaucratic **managerialism**, and pragmatic **technique**. His ecclesial setting within the **Presbyterian Church** and his academic placement in a mainline seminary pressed him to ask whether ministers serve out of their own competency or as participants in the **ongoing ministry of the living Christ**. The question is not simply sociological but dogmatic: Who ministers when the church ministers? Purves answers with a clear Christological claim, shaped by **T. F. Torrance** and **James B. Torrance**, that it is first and last the **triune God** who ministers through the **vicarious humanity of Christ** in the **power of the Spirit**.

Purves situates his method as **practical dogmatics**, a retrieval of **patristic** and **Reformed** sources to recalibrate practice. Rather than a **correlational** method that negotiates between Christian symbols and contemporary experience, he adopts a **theological interpretation of ministry** advanced by figures like **Barth** and the **Torrance** school, where ministry is an *ad extra* extension of God’s *ad intra* life revealed in Christ. This yields a theological ontology of pastoral action: the church’s **proclamation**, **sacramental celebration**, and **cure of souls** are not human initiatives seeking divine assistance, but **participations** in the **prophetic, priestly, and kingly** offices of the **ascended Lord**. The pastoral agent is thus primarily a **witness** and **servant** within the **economy of grace**, rather than an autonomous professional manager of religious goods.

Two further method commitments mark Purves. First, a resolute **Christological concentration**: soteriology is not merely the application of benefits but **union with Christ**, such that **justification** and **sanctification** flow from sharing in the Son’s relation to the Father by the **Spirit**. Second, a robust doctrine of the **ascension and session**, where Christ’s **priestly intercession** and **royal reign** ground the church’s confidence that ministry is not absent of Christ but under the active rule of the **risen Lord**. These emphases cohere with the **Torrance** stress on the **vicarious humanity** of Christ and an anti-**Pelagian** posture toward ministry’s agency.

#### 2. Early retrieval: Pastoral Theology in the Classical Tradition (2001)
Purves’s **Pastoral Theology in the Classical Tradition** distills five exemplars of the *cura animarum* to argue that authentic pastoral care is doctrinally thick. He canvasses **Gregory of Nazianzus** on the gravity of the **pastoral office**, **Gregory the Great** on **pastoral rule**, **Martin Bucer** on **reformation ecclesiology** and the **munus triplex**, **Richard Baxter** on the disciplined **cure of souls**, and **Friedrich Schleiermacher** on **practical theology** as the church’s science. The thesis is that classic voices locate pastoral identity not in technique but in **communion with the triune God** through **Word and sacrament**. By retrieving **Bucer** and **Baxter**, Purves signals a settled **Reformed** conviction: pastoral leadership is a ministry of **the Word**, ordered to **catechesis**, **discipline**, and **sacramental fidelity** as extensions of Christ’s **prophetic** and **kingly** work. In invoking **Schleiermacher**, he both acknowledges the birth of modern **practical theology** and resists its drift toward **experience** as norm, insisting that **dogmatics** must regulate practice.

This retrieval accomplishes two things. First, it locates Purves within a broad **ressourcement** movement, akin to **Barth** and **Torrance**, where **patristic** and **Reformational** witnesses rehabilitate pastoral confidence in **divine action**. Second, it frames his later dogmatic moves: the center of pastoral theology is the **living Christ**, the **ascended High Priest** whose **intercession** secures the church’s ministry. By grounding *cura animarum* in **doctrine** rather than **psychology** or **management**, Purves establishes an ecclesial grammar in which pastoral care is essentially **soteriological participation**.

#### 3. Christological foundation: Reconstructing Pastoral Theology (2004)
In **Reconstructing Pastoral Theology: A Christological Foundation**, Purves articulates his core dogmatic claim. Drawing explicitly on **Athanasius**, **Calvin**, **Barth**, and especially **James B. Torrance**, he advances the **vicarious humanity of Christ** as the basis for pastoral identity. Jesus Christ, the true human, lives our response to the Father on our behalf. Pastoral ministry then is not the church offering its own faith, repentance, or love, but the church’s **Spirit-enabled sharing** in Christ’s perfect **filial obedience** and **priestly intercession**. The key terms are **union with Christ** and **participation**: all *munera* of ministry derive from the **munus triplex** of Christ. Ministers proclaim because Christ the **Prophet** speaks; they preside at the table because Christ the **Priest** offers himself and intercedes; they govern because Christ the **King** rules.

Methodologically, this book critiques **correlationist practical theology** as insufficiently **theocentric**. Figures like **Don Browning** and **Edward Farley** are engaged as emblematic of an empirical or praxis-first approach that tacitly presumes human agency as basic. Purves instead insists on **revelation** and **soteriology** as primary: we know pastoral action by knowing **who Christ is** and **what Christ is doing**. This has implications for categories: the **ordo salutis** becomes less a sequence of discrete benefits and more a **participatory union** with corresponding **forensic** and **transformative** dimensions as twin aspects of being in Christ. The upshot is a pastoral theology that is resolutely **Trinitarian** and **Christocentric**, with the **Spirit** as the **bond of union** who incorporates the church into the Son’s relation to the Father.

#### 4. The cross and the end of managerialism: The Crucifixion of Ministry (2007)
With **The Crucifixion of Ministry**, Purves strikes a pastoral nerve. He frames contemporary ministry as addicted to **technique**, enslaved to **success metrics**, and governed by a **theologia gloriae**. The antidote is the **theologia crucis**: our ministries must be crucified so that only the **ministry of Jesus** lives. The theological engine is the **vicarious agency of Christ**. Pastors must renounce the presumption that outcomes depend on their ingenuity, learning instead to **bear witness** to what the **ascended Lord** is already doing among his people. This is neither quietism nor romanticism. It is a concrete recommitment to **prayer**, **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **pastoral visitation** as the loci where Christ promises to act by the **Spirit**.

The contrast between **managerial pragmatism** and **participatory ministry** functions as a sharp diagnostic. On the one hand, Purves exposes a soft **Pelagianism** that assumes grace supplements self-sufficient programs. On the other, he proposes a pastoral habitus of **repentant dependence** on **divine initiative**. The cruciform posture re-centers authority in **Word and sacrament**, aligns expectations with **Christ’s weakness and power**, and tempers triumphalism with **eschatological hope** grounded in the **cross** and **resurrection**. The pastoral task is not to make Christ present but to announce, enact, and discern the **presence and action** of the living **High Priest**.

#### 5. Hope and the presence of the risen Lord: The Resurrection of Ministry (2010)
In **The Resurrection of Ministry**, Purves complements cruciform renunciation with **resurrection hope**. If ministry is first crucified, it is also **raised** as participation in the life of the **risen Christ**. The ascended Lord’s **royal reign** and **priestly intercession** continue and therefore animate the church’s practices. Purves argues that pastoral discouragement and burnout often stem from a functional **absent Christology**, where Jesus is a memory rather than an active Lord. Robust confession of the **resurrection** and **ascension** transfigures expectations: preaching becomes **hearing the living Word**, pastoral care becomes **encounter with the Shepherd**, and leadership becomes **service under the King**. The stress on the **Spirit** remains vital. It is the **Holy Spirit** who binds the church to Christ, making the church’s acts genuine **means of grace** because they echo and share in Christ’s **own acts**.

This text deepens Purves’s **Trinitarian practical ontology**. Ministry is eschatologically shaped; it is ordered by the **already-not yet**. The church awaits consummation yet lives now under the **session** of Christ. Purves thus integrates **eschatology**, **Christology**, and **ecclesiology**: the pastoral office signifies Christ’s **royal governance**, the preached **gospel** signifies his **prophetic speech**, and the **Eucharist** signifies his **priestly self-offering** and ongoing **intercession**. The net effect is to re-describe ministry in terms that are **confidently God-centered** and **pastorally realistic**.

#### 6. Union as the grammar of the Christian life: Union in Christ (2014)
**Union in Christ: A Guide to the Life of Faith** distills Purves’s soteriology for church use. The governing claim is that **union with Christ** is not a metaphor but the **ontological ground** of **justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **perseverance**. Echoing **Calvin’s duplex gratia**, Purves frames saving benefits as twin gifts within a single **Christological reality**: to be in Christ is to be declared righteous and to be renewed by the **Spirit**. He underscores **participation** without abandoning **forensic** language, yet the accent falls on the **personal relation** with the Son as the site where the **benefits** are received. The **vicarious humanity** theme ensures that even our faith and obedience are **derivative** of Christ’s own.

In this account, the **ascension** remains decisive. Because Christ is **ascended and seated**, believers live from his **intercession**. The Christian life is anchored in the **objective work** of the Mediator and subjectively realized through **Spirit-wrought union**. Pastoral implications abound: assurance rests in Christ’s **priestly office**, sacraments become **participatory signs**, and spiritual disciplines are practices of **sharing** in Christ’s **communion** with the Father. Purves’s Reformed contours remain visible in his esteem for **preaching**, **sacramental realism** without confusion, and the centrality of **Scripture** as the Spirit’s instrument of **Christ’s self-communication**.

#### 7. Ascension, session, and the shape of ministry
Throughout his corpus, Purves amplifies the relatively neglected doctrines of **ascension** and **session**. Influenced by **Athanasius** on the *homoousios* and the patristic **Christology** that anchors soteriology in who Christ is, and guided by **Barth** and **Torrance** on the **objective reality of reconciliation**, Purves construes the **ascension** not as absence but as **lordly presence**. Christ’s human life is not discarded but exalted. This bears on ministry in at least three ways. First, it affirms **the church’s confidence** that Christ is **actively present** in Word and sacrament by the **Spirit**, thus preventing a **deistic** drift in pastoral expectations. Second, it secures the uniqueness of **Christ’s priesthood**, guarding against sacerdotal **overreach** even as it authorizes priestly **intercession** in pastoral prayer as **participation**, not duplication. Third, it situates pastoral governance within **Christ’s kingship**, discouraging both **authoritarianism** and **anarchy** by reminding leaders that authority is **ministerial** and **derivative**.

This ascension-centering resonates with the **extra Calvinisticum**, in the sense that Christ’s divine life is not circumscribed by his human nature, and yet, following **Reformed** Christology, his human nature remains localized and therefore sacramental presence is mediated by the **Spirit** rather than by a **ubiquity** of the human nature. Purves does not turn this into polemic, but the **Reformed** instinct shapes his sacramental and pastoral claims: Christ is **really present** by the **Spirit** as the church gathers under **Scripture** and at the **Table**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and practical outcomes
Purves’s main argument unfolds in dialogue with **practical theology** as a modern discipline. He appreciates **Friedrich Schleiermacher** for dignifying practice as theology’s crown, yet resists the tendency, in **Browning** and **Farley**, to reverse the **norming relation** of **dogmatics** to practice. He engages **pastoral counseling** paradigms critically, grateful for **psychological** insight while insisting on **theological agency**: the minister counsels as one who stands within Christ’s **priestly compassion**. He converses positively with **Calvin** and **Bucer** on **discipline** and **catechesis**, with **Baxter** on **oversight** and **visitation**, and with the **Torrance** tradition on **Trinitarian participation** and **vicarious obedience**.

Practically, Purves’s program reorients pastoral curricula and congregational life toward **Word and sacrament**, **prayer**, and **catechesis** as the essential sites of **participatory ministry**. He encourages ministers to name, in sermon and session meeting alike, the **presence and action of Christ**, and to evaluate programs not by **measurable outcomes** alone but by fidelity to **Christ’s mission**. In pastoral care, he recommends classic **penitential** and **assurance-giving** practices, understood not as moralism but as exercises in **union**. In leadership, he counsels a **derivative authority**, accountable to **Scripture**, under the **ascended Lord**.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis and abiding contribution
Across two decades of writing, Purves’s theological synthesis is coherent and pastorally fertile. The nodes of **union with Christ**, **vicarious humanity**, **ascension and session**, and **munus triplex** provide a grammar for re-describing the church’s life in resolutely **God-centered** terms. His retrieval of **classical pastoral theology** aligns practices with **dogmatics**, and his criticism of **managerial** and **therapeutic** reductions exposes subtle **Pelagianisms**. Purves’s originality lies less in novel doctrine than in re-suturing the **practice of ministry** to the **doctrine of God** and **Christ**, thereby offering ministers a way to speak honestly about failure and hope under the **cross** and **resurrection** of the Lord. He does so in a recognizably **Reformed** key, with **Scripture** as norm, **preaching** at the center, and **sacramental** life ordered to the **ascended Christ**.

Finally, Purves’s stress on the **Spirit’s agency** in uniting the church to the Son, and on the **ascended Lord’s intercession**, gives a compelling account of pastoral assurance. Ministry is not a human project seeking divine blessing but the **mission of the triune God** in which the church shares. This account motivates resilient prayer, bold proclamation, and persevering care, as the church participates in the **ongoing ministry of Jesus**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **confessional Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Purves’s work is a salutary retrieval of **union with Christ**, **ascension**, and **theologia crucis** for a weary ministry culture. His insistence that ministry is **derivative participation** in Christ’s **munus triplex** and anchored in **Word and sacrament** coheres with **Reformed orthodoxy** and deserves wide reception. Yet tensions surface at several points of doctrinal proportion. First, the **participationist** idiom, shaped by **Torrance** and **Barth**, can eclipse the **forensic** dimension of salvation when it reframes the **ordo salutis** primarily in **ontological** terms. A WTS corrective would reaffirm that **imputation** and **penal substitution** as acts of God’s **covenant justice** are not simply corollaries of union but constitutive, with **federal headship** in Adam and Christ clarifying the legal ground of **justification**. Second, the emphasis on **vicarious humanity** risks rhetorical imprecision regarding the **extent of atonement** and the subjective appropriation of benefits. While Purves does not teach universalism, the grammar of universal **objective reconciliation** should be paired with confessional clarity about **particular redemption** and the **Spirit’s effectual call** within the **covenant of grace**. Third, in pastoral agency, the appeal to Christ’s **ongoing priesthood** must guard the uniqueness of his **once-for-all sacrifice** and the **ministerial** not **mediatorial** character of pastoral acts, lest participation language blur **sacerdotal** boundaries. Finally, to strengthen his program within classical **Reformed** boundaries, one may integrate Purves’s **union** focus with **duplex gratia**, maintain the **law-gospel** distinction in preaching, and articulate how **covenant theology** frames the church’s practices as **means of grace** under the **Word-Spirit** economy. With these calibrations, Purves’s project remains a powerful ally for Reformed ministry, keeping ministers low under the **cross**, lifted by the **ascension**, and grounded in **Christ’s present ministry**.
