### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Andrew S. Malone belongs to the contemporary wave of **evangelical biblical theologians** who, since the 1990s and into the 2010s, have sought to read Scripture as a coherent canon while maintaining exegetical discipline and doctrinal fidelity. Teaching in Australia and associated with institutions shaped by the renaissance of **canonical biblical theology** in the Anglophone world, Malone writes within the orbit of the **New Studies in Biblical Theology** series edited by **D. A. Carson**, a venue that prizes **exegetically grounded**, **theologically constructive** studies. The two pillars of his contribution are the themes of **priesthood and mediation** and the question of **Christophany**, that is, how one ought to identify the subject of Old Testament appearances of God and the **Angel of the LORD**. Malone’s work is best construed as a constructive retrieval of **biblical mediation** and a hermeneutical admonition regarding **progressive revelation**. He stresses **authorial intention**, an ordered movement from promise to fulfillment, and a chastened use of **typology** that respects both **human authors** and the **divine author** of Scripture.

Malone’s method reflects a conscious refusal of both atomistic exegesis and speculative system-building. He moves within a tradition catalyzed by **Geerhardus Vos’s** diachronic sensibilities and more recent canonical syntheses by **G. K. Beale** and **Peter Gentry and Stephen Wellum**, yet he insists on the slow work of careful exegesis in **Hebrew and Greek** texts before drawing christological lines. He champions **progressive revelation** in the thick sense that later canonical texts legitimately clarify earlier ones, sometimes reframe them, yet do not license a-historical imposition of later **Nicene** or **Chalcedonian** idioms upon ancient Israel’s discourse in a way that bypasses the Old Testament’s own **sanctuary, holiness, and atonement** grammar. This hermeneutical patience, repeated across his works, is supported by his diplomatic engagement with **patristic**, **medieval**, **Reformation**, and modern readings of theophanies and priesthood, which he audits for their exegetical warrant and doctrinal yield.

#### 2. Knowing Jesus in the Old Testament? Cautious Christophany
Malone’s 2015 volume, **Knowing Jesus in the Old Testament? A Fresh Look at Christophanies**, is the signature statement of his hermeneutic. The provocation is straightforward: many Christian readers have identified the **Angel of the LORD** or various Old Testament appearances as the **preincarnate Son**, concluding that Jesus is repeatedly and directly visible throughout the Old Testament prior to the **incarnation**. Malone surveys the classic arguments from **Justin Martyr** through **Tertullian**, and later **John Owen**, who with confidence discerned the **Logos** active and visible in patriarchal narratives, **Exodus**, and **Judges**. He then turns to **Augustine’s De Trinitate**, which insists that Old Testament theophanies involve created media, including angels, as divinely commissioned vehicles of revelation rather than hypostatic self-disclosures of any divine person. Malone aligns broadly with the **Augustinian** caution, arguing that the textual markers surrounding the **malak YHWH** point to angelic agency bearing the **divine Name**, speaking with **divine prerogatives**, and receiving worship as a function of authorized representation. For Malone, such episodes speak truly of God’s presence without collapsing the **Creator-creature distinction** or prematurely specifying which **divine person** is present.

Exegesis secures his argument. He treats **Genesis 16** and **Genesis 22**, **Exodus 3** and the **burning bush**, **Joshua 5** with the **commander of the LORD’s army**, and **Judges 6 and 13** with repeated appearances of the **Angel of the LORD**. The narratives show fluid alternation between angelic messenger and divine speech, the so-called **messenger formula** in which the envoy speaks as the sender. Malone contends that this phenomenon is an ancient near-eastern and biblical convention of **agency** rather than evidence for a distinct personal identity of the **Son** manifesting *ad hoc* prior to Bethlehem. He reads the **Name theology** of **Exodus 23** and the sanctuary presence in **Deuteronomy** as strengthening the notion that God’s presence is mediated through emissaries and cultic structures, not to be confused with an ontological unveiling of a particular **hypostasis**. The cumulative case cautions against confident identifications of **Christophany** where the text supports a textured theophany grounded in **angelic mediation**.

Malone’s conclusion is not an anti-christological reading of the Old Testament but a disciplined **christotelic** posture. He underscores that the Old Testament witnesses to the **triune God** and ordered expectations that find their **telos** in **Jesus Christ**, yet insists that the trail from **Torah**, **Prophets**, and **Writings** to the **Gospels** runs by way of **typology, promise, and covenant**, not by retrojecting the contours of **incarnational visibility** into every theophanic narrative. He counsels a reverent distinction between saying that the **Son** was at work in all Old Testament revelation, which is true in the order of **opera Trinitatis ad extra**, and saying that the **Son** appeared as such in those narratives, which must be exegetically demonstrated text by text. This distinction yields a hermeneutic that honors **Trinitarian orthodoxy**, **divine accommodation**, and the **progress of redemptive history** without disabling rich **christological fulfillment**.

#### 3. God’s Mediators: Reframing priesthood across the canon
If the Christophany volume delineates hermeneutical boundaries, Malone’s 2017 study, **God’s Mediators: A Biblical Theology of Priesthood**, fills the field with positive substance. The thesis is programmatic: the Bible’s story turns on **mediation**, and **priesthood** is broader and richer than the **Aaronic-Levitical** institution. Malone traces a canonical arc from **Genesis** to **Revelation** in which God orders his **presence**, **holiness**, and **blessing** to reach his people through divinely appointed **mediators**, culminating in the unique **high priesthood** of **Jesus Christ** and the derivative **priesthood of all believers**. He begins with **Eden** as a prototypical sanctuary, noting the priestly resonance of Hebrew verbs like *abad* and *shamar* in **Genesis 2**, the eastward orientation and guarded access, and parallels with later **tabernacle** and **temple** motifs. Adam is cast as a royal-priestly figure whose failing makes later **cultic mediations** necessary. From the patriarchs who build altars, to **Moses** as covenant mediator, to **Israel** called a **kingdom of priests** in **Exodus 19**, Malone discerns a widening and narrowing of priestly vocation in Israel’s history.

Malone rightly locates **Leviticus** as the epicenter of the Old Testament’s priestly grammar. He reads the **sacrificial system** as orchestrating access to a holy God, focusing on **atonement** not merely as penal substitution but as a complex of **purification, ransom, and communion**. The **Day of Atonement** embodies both the removal of impurity and the covering of guilt, thereby safeguarding God’s **indwelling presence** among a redeemed yet still sinful people. The **Levites** safeguard holy space, the **high priest** bears names and blood into God’s presence, and sacrificial blood, as life, accomplishes **cleansing**. Malone then tracks the development into **Davidic** and **Solomonic** settings, with **kings** and **prophets** functioning as mediators in distinctive registers: kings represent the people in corporate righteousness and justice, prophets prosecute the covenant and speak God’s word with authority, all oriented around temple-centered **holiness**. The exilic and post-exilic periods sharpen the longing for a final mediator who will unite priestly and royal vocations.

The christological center is the **Epistle to the Hebrews**, which Malone treats as the canonical capstone for **priesthood**. Christ is the singular **high priest** according to the order of **Melchizedek**, who offers himself once for all, enters the **heavenly sanctuary**, and continues **intercession** at the Father’s right hand. The new covenant is marked by the fulfillment and surpassing transformation of the old cultus: sacrifices cease because the one sacrifice is sufficient, the veil is opened because the mediator is inviolably holy and permanently effective, and priesthood is concentrated in the person of **Christ**. Yet, and this is crucial for Malone’s ecclesial application, this concentration does not abolish **priesthood** but reconfigures it, yielding the **priesthood of all believers** who offer spiritual sacrifices, mediated participation in God’s presence, and intercessory service in the world. The Church’s priestly identity is derivative, non-atoning, and communal, constituted by union with the **high priest** and animated by the **Spirit**.

#### 4. Mediation, atonement, and ecclesial implications
Malone’s biblical theology of **mediation** carries significant doctrinal implications. On **atonement**, he presses readers to read **Leviticus** and **Hebrews** together, reserving conceptual space for both **penal substitution** and **purification**. The **blood** that cleanses sancta and sinners alike is not magic but sacramental sign and divinely appointed means for restoring **holiness**. This leads to a richer view of **sin** as both guilt and defilement, of **redemption** as both forgiveness and cleansing, and of **reconciliation** as restored access. On **sanctuary**, he leans into the cosmic-temple impulse associated with **G. K. Beale**, but he resists flattening all symbols into a monolith; he keeps the **tabernacle-temple** nexus grounded in Israel’s real cult while pointing to **Christ** as the true temple and the **church** as the living temple.

Ecclesially, Malone’s account of the **priesthood of all believers** guards against two opposite errors. Against clerical overreach, he emphasizes that the church’s priesthood is widely distributed and fundamentally oriented to **prayer, witness, and holiness**, not sacrificial atonement. Against egalitarian flattening that forgets ordered ministry, he maintains that derivative priesthood is anchored in and limited by the once-for-all **high priesthood** of **Christ**, whose office is inimitable. The result is a catholic evangelical mapping in which congregations embody **mediated presence** through the **Word and Sacrament**, corporate intercession, and sanctified community life. The posture becomes missional: the church exists as a royal-priestly people before the nations, echoing **Exodus 19** and anticipating the **Revelation** vision of a kingdom of priests who reign with the Lamb.

#### 5. Interlocutors, polemics, and constructive tensions
Malone’s work inhabits and interrogates the evangelical consensus on **christological hermeneutics**. He is appreciative of **Calvin’s** doctrine of **divine accommodation** and shares the reformer’s suspicion of overconfident claims about seeing the divine essence, yet he disagrees with those strands of Reformed and patristic interpretation that equate the **Angel of the LORD** with the **preincarnate Christ** as a default. His interlocutors include **Justin Martyr**, whose **Logos** theology readily read the angelic envoy as the Son, and **John Owen**, who, reading **Hebrews**, tended to locate the Son intensively across the Old Testament economy. In modern debates, Malone stands apart from popular angelological reconstructions, such as those associated with **Michael Heiser**, that multiply personified hypostases in Second Temple texts. He also interacts implicitly with figural exegesis under the influence of **Richard Hays**, welcoming its attention to **intertextual echoes** but warning that figuration must be tethered to **canonical context** and textual signals.

Constructively, Malone profits from **Augustine’s** sober theophany doctrine, receiving the patristic insistence that divine manifestations are mediated through created signs or agents. He also draws from **Gentry and Wellum’s** work on **kingdom through covenant**, using covenantal sequencing to structure the rise and transformation of **priesthood**. His dialogue with the **Beale**-inspired **temple** thesis refines the integration of **Eden**, **tabernacle**, and **church** without collapsing all mediation into a metaphor. In Hebrews studies, Malone aligns with scholarship that emphasizes **Jesus’ heavenly session** and **ongoing intercession**, such as **David Peterson** and **Gareth Cockerill**, embracing a robustly cultic reading of Christ’s present ministry. The through-line in all these engagements is Malone’s programmatic commitment to let **biblical categories** set the agenda and to resist pressure to deliver christological conclusions that cannot be textually earned.

#### 6. Doctrinal integration: Trinity, revelation, and history
Though working primarily as a biblical theologian, Malone’s proposals invite and sustain doctrinal integration. On the **Trinity**, the Christophany project is a case study in distinguishing **opera ad extra** from **personal missions**. All that God does outside himself is the common work of the **triune God**, yet the **incarnation** and **Pentecost** are unique missions of the **Son** and **Spirit**. To claim multiple preincarnate missions of the **Son** as visible angelic appearances risks unwittingly normalizing what the New Testament treats as singular. Malone therefore advocates describing Old Testament theophanies as mediated revelations by which the triune God engages his people through angels, glory, or cultic signs, while acknowledging that the **Son** is eternally the mediator within the Trinity and therefore the archetype of all historical mediation. On **revelation**, Malone encourages reading backward without reading past, bringing **Hebrews** and **John** to bear while refusing to erase the **Mosaic** and **prophetic** idioms.

On **redemptive history**, Malone’s braided story of **priesthood** and **mediation** foregrounds covenantal sequence and the maturation of **access to God**. The Old Testament’s sacral economy is neither mistake nor foil but a divinely instituted pedagogy of **holiness** that culminates in **Christ**. The **new covenant** does not cancel mediation but perfects it by uniting the office of mediator with the person of the **Son**, enthroned as **priest-king**. The church’s life thus becomes an arena of derivative mediation through the **Spirit**, translating Old Testament cultic categories into **spiritual sacrifices**, **intercession**, and **communion**. Malone integrates these themes with a practiced balance of continuity and discontinuity that helps readers avoid both supersessionist disdain for the old economy and ritualistic nostalgia.

#### 7. Pastoral and pedagogical payoffs
As a teacher and writer for the church, Malone aims at recalibrating evangelical instincts about **Christ in the Old Testament** and about the **church’s priestly calling**. He equips preachers to preach **Christ** from the Old Testament by honoring **textual horizons**, tracing **typology**, and letting **Hebrews** determine the language of priestly fulfillment rather than finding **Christophanies** under every significant tree in **Genesis** and **Judges**. He equally equips congregations to own their **priesthood of all believers**, moving beyond clerical proxies toward corporate **intercession**, **holiness**, and mission as a **kingdom of priests**. His work thus presses a retrieval of **sacred presence** and **mediated grace** at the heart of ordinary church life, renewing attention to **Word and Sacrament** as loci of divine access and to the ethical stakes of living as a holy people.

The pedagogical posture embodies a wise catholicity within evangelicalism. Malone speaks sympathetically of **traditioned readings** while giving Scripture the final say. He considers the strength of **patristic** and **Reformed** instincts to see Christ everywhere, then asks whether the text warrants that claim or whether a stronger **christotelic** reading would do better. He refuses the false choice between cold historicism and exaggerated figuration, offering instead a **canonical realism** in which symbols, institutions, and agents carry real divine meaning through time and across covenants.

#### 8. Reception and influence
Malone’s projects have been welcomed as clarifying contributions within the evangelical ecosystem. The NSBT platform gave **God’s Mediators** wide circulation in seminaries and among pastors, where its careful taxonomy of **priesthood** has been deployed in courses on **Pentateuch**, **Hebrews**, and **ecclesiology**. The Christophany book has sparked edifying debate in classrooms and churches, especially where older catechesis equated the **Angel of the LORD** with a **preincarnate Christ** as a matter of course. Malone’s dual emphasis on **mediated presence** and **progressive revelation** resonates with the instincts of **biblical-theological preaching** associated with the redemptive-historical tradition, even as it restrains some of its more adventurous christological claims.

Influence is also evident in cross-disciplinary conversations. Systematicians have used Malone’s categories to reframe the **munus sacerdotale** of Christ in light of **Levitical** purity and temple logic, and practical theologians have drawn on his account of the **priesthood of all believers** to retool liturgical participation and pastoral care as corporate **intercession**. At the same time, Malone’s name appears in footnotes where debates about **sensus plenior** and **trinitarian exegesis** are adjudicated, since his hermeneutic forces the question of how far the **divine author**’s intent extends beyond the human author in articulating **christological fulfillment**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage point, much in Malone invites hearty affirmation. His canon-wide attention to **covenant**, **typology**, and **progressive revelation** tracks closely with **Vosian** biblical theology. His robustly cultic reading of **Hebrews**, his careful mapping of **atonement** as both **substitution** and **purification**, and his ecclesial retrieval of the **priesthood of all believers** cohere with **confessional Reformed** commitments to **Christ’s once-for-all priesthood**, **Word and Sacrament**, and a holy people under covenant. The WTS tradition can thus readily commend Malone’s central theses about **mediation** and the church’s derivative priestly vocation.

The principal point of tension is Malone’s cautious stance on **Christophany**, which can appear, to some Reformed readers, as an under-realized **trinitarian exegesis** or a throttled **christocentric reading** of the Old Testament. The Westminster tradition, drawing on **Calvin**, **Owen**, and a strong doctrine of **divine authorship**, is apt to argue that the **Angel of the LORD** is best construed as a theophanic manifestation of the **mediatorial Son** in anticipation of the incarnation, supported by the analogy of faith and the **unity of the covenant of grace**. Here a Reformed alternative would press a principled distinction: one can identify the **Angel** as a theophanic manifestation of the **Son** economically, in light of the Son’s eternal role as mediator and the **autotheos** of the Son, without claiming ontological visibility of the divine essence or erasing **created mediation**. This avenue preserves Malone’s salutary emphasis on **agency** and **accommodation** while strengthening a canonical, trinitarian rationale for identifying key theophanies as **economies of the Son**. Likewise, a fuller Reformed account of **sensus plenior** could acknowledge a divine authorial surplus that warrants christological readings even where the human author’s horizon is limited. The upshot is not dismissal but development: Malone’s disciplined exegesis and theology of **mediation** supply a sturdy framework that the Reformed tradition can inhabit, qualifying his caution on **Christophany** with a thicker **covenantal christology** informed by the **analogía fidei**.
