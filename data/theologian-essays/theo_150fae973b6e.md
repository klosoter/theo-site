### ESSAY
Sheila Jasanoff, born in 1944 and trained in both **law** and **linguistics** at **Harvard**, came of age intellectually as the certainties of **positivism** gave way to the interpretive turn in **science and technology studies**. Her academic path through **Cornell**, where she founded the STS department, to the **Harvard Kennedy School** in 1998 traced the institutional maturation of an inquiry into how **knowledge**, **expertise**, and **governance** cohere in modern polities. The historical context of late twentieth-century **regulatory science**, **biotechnology**, and **environmental risk** furnished her with empirical theaters in which the epistemic and the civic refracted one another. From the outset, her method was resolutely **comparative** and **jurisprudential**, attentive to how the *lex* of science policy materializes distinctive **civic epistemologies**, and how states discipline the social life of **truth**. This formation grounds her signature claim that **science and social order are co-produced**, not in a flattening relativism, but in an analytic that binds human **normativity** to the material **world-making** of modern technoscience.

The methodological center of Jasanoff’s corpus is the framework of **co-production**, articulated most programmatically in **States of Knowledge, 2004**, with the manifesto-like opening, Ordering knowledge, ordering society. The thesis is that the stabilization of **facts**, **identities**, **institutions**, and **norms** unfolds together, such that work on any one axis implicates the others. Co-production displaces the older separation of **context** and **content**, refusing the posture that treats bare nature as an autonomous **norma normata** to which society subsequently adapts. Instead, she insists that the processes that make the world legible also **constitute** modes of political community. A second methodological pillar is the concept of **civic epistemologies**, elaborated in **Designs on Nature, 2005**. Civic epistemologies are the culturally settled ways by which polities test claims, authorize experts, and render knowledge publicly acceptable. They comprise repertoires of **reason-giving**, **publicity**, **accountability**, and **expert judgment**, differentially configured across nations and legal orders. Her third pillar, **sociotechnical imaginaries**, developed with Sang-Hyun Kim in **Dreamscapes of Modernity, 2015**, names the collectively held visions of desirable futures that animate projects of technical change and entrench **power**.

The early book **The Fifth Branch, 1990** sets the horizon. There Jasanoff shows that scientific advisers, placed at the nexus of **regulatory agencies** and **policy**, function as a de facto fifth branch of government, performing not only technical analysis but also **value-laden** judgments under uncertainty. Case studies in **risk assessment**, **toxicology**, and **environmental regulation** disclose how experimental protocols, default assumptions, and uncertainty factors encode **policy choices** while presenting as neutral science. The core argument reframes expertise as **institutionalized judgment** under contestable normative constraints. Rather than decrying this impurity, she asks how the institutional design of **advisory committees**, **peer review**, and **public comment** might better align with democratic **accountability**. This early contribution is a sustained challenge to the myth of a detachable realm of **pure science**, an anchor point for her later reflections on **technologies of humility** as virtues of governance.

In **Science at the Bar, 1995**, written in the wake of the **Daubert** decision of 1993 on admissibility of expert evidence, Jasanoff turns to the encounter between **law** and **science**. She argues that American adjudication, with its adversarial **proceduralism** and jury-based fact-finding, cultivates a distinctive style of **knowledge testing**, one that differs sharply from academic peer review. Rules of evidence, standards like general acceptance or reliability, and the craft of cross-examination instantiate a civic epistemology in which lay **citizenship** and expert **authority** meet in structured confrontation. The analysis yields an enduring lesson: there is no simple translation from **laboratory certainty** to **legal adequacy**. Courts perform their own normatively inflected work of fact-making, and the Daubert trilogy effectively reconfigured the role of judges as **gatekeepers** of science. This engagement with the **law-science interface** deepened her claim that institutional arrangements produce specific modalities of **public reason**.

The edited volume **States of Knowledge, 2004** installs **co-production** as a common language across STS. The essays track how **classification**, **measurement**, and **standardization** furnish the scaffolding for **order**, while simultaneously forging the very kinds of subjects and objects that populate that order. Jasanoff’s own chapters press the idea of **constitutional moments** in technoscience, episodes in which crises force the renegotiation of how **sovereignty**, **responsibility**, and **rationality** interlock. The trope of constitutionalism signals her deep commitment to **comparative public law**, while also reminding readers that knowledge regimes are never simply epistemic. They are always also **juridical**, **moral**, and **political**, distributing burdens of **proof**, forms of **liability**, and expectations of **care**. Co-production here functions less as a slogan and more as a methodological grammar for tracing those linkages.

The comparative monograph **Designs on Nature, 2005** is her most sustained explication of **civic epistemologies**. Through parallel investigations of **biotechnology governance** in the **United States**, **United Kingdom**, and **Germany**, she shows that each polity enacts distinct tests of **legitimacy** in the face of techno-scientific novelty. The United States leans toward **adversarial legalism**, market-mediated decisions, and a rhetoric of **individual liberty**, producing contentious regulatory pathways in areas like **genetically modified organisms** and **stem cell research**. The United Kingdom crafts **public reason** through officially sanctioned deliberation, **Royal Commissions**, and social trust in technocratic accountability, yielding a more **managerial pluralism**. Germany manifests a **precautionary constitutionalism**, with deep entanglement of **dignity**, **risk** and corporatist negotiation, rooted in the **Grundgesetz** and the historical memory of past technological harms. The theoretical point is not cultural determinism but the demonstration that modes of **public justification** shape the uptake and trajectory of science, embedding substantive **values** in technical design and regulatory practice.

With **Reframing Rights, 2011**, Jasanoff extends the inquiry to **bioconstitutionalism**, the process by which advances in **biomedicine** alter the content and form of **rights**, **personhood**, and **obligations**. Issues like embryo status, tissue property, and genetic privacy become sites where old **constitutional settlements** are reinterpreted in light of new capacities to intervene in life. The shift from mechanical inventions to living systems pushes law and polity to rethink the grounds of **dignity**, **consent**, and **injury**. This work registers her enduring interest in how concepts native to **jurisprudence** and **political theory** are re-specified by scientific practice, and how those re-specifications feed back into the organization of **expertise** and **authority**. The book also displays her attention to **ethics as governance**, a phrase that anticipates the thematic sweep of **The Ethics of Invention, 2016**.

The collection **Science and Public Reason, 2012** gathers and sharpens her articulation of **technologies of humility**. In contrast to technocratic **hubris**, which promises mastery through prediction, she commends institutionalized practices of **anticipation**, **participation**, **integration**, and **reflection**. Anticipation requires humility about unknown unknowns and the temporal distribution of **risk**. Participation extends the circle of **accountability** beyond credentialed experts to affected publics. Integration resists siloing, insisting that **ethics**, **law**, and **social knowledge** cohabit with technical analysis. Reflection keeps the purposes and **imaginaries** of governance under scrutiny. Technologies of humility do not foreclose science but direct it under conditions of **pluralism** and **uncertainty**, cultivating governance as a morally accountable form of practical **wisdom**. This normative move gives Jasanoff’s thought its constructive temper, offering a disciplined alternative to both **technocracy** and **populist suspicion**.

The co-edited **Dreamscapes of Modernity, 2015** posits **sociotechnical imaginaries** as the energy that mobilizes collectivities toward particular technological futures. Imaginaries are not mere utopias. They are performative, underwriting **infrastructure**, **funding**, **standards**, and **institutions**, while shaping the self-understanding of **nations** and **communities**. The idea accounts for the stability of projects like **nuclear power**, **space exploration**, or **bioeconomies**, even where epistemic uncertainty persists. It also provides a lens for diagnosing how visions of **progress**, **security**, or **sustainability** authorize particular sacrifices and distributions of **benefit** and **harm**. By seating imagination within the apparatus of rule, Jasanoff again exhibits the co-productive circuitry between **knowledge-making** and **world-making**, bringing theological resonances of **hope**, **telos**, and **providence** into contact with the secular grammar of public futures.

**The Ethics of Invention, 2016** and **Can Science Make Sense of Life?, 2019** bring to a head Jasanoff’s concern that modern societies have outpaced their democratic **practical reason**. The first surveys the **hidden injuries of infrastructure** and the lag of **liability** regimes behind complex networks of harm, arguing that breathless innovation frequently externalizes costs onto the least empowered. The remedy is not a brake on invention but the embedding of **responsibility**, **repair**, and **care** within design and policy. The second book interrogates the promissory claims of **molecular biology**, especially gene-centric accounts that presume science can adjudicate the meaning of **life**. Jasanoff defends the irreducibility of **meaning** to measurement, urging that plural **value-languages** must be honored alongside biological explanation. In both works, a recurring anchor is **public reason**, understood not as an abstract consensus device in the Rawlsian sense, but as an ensemble of situated practices through which communities deliberate about **ends** and **means** under conditions of partial knowledge.

Across this corpus, Jasanoff’s interlocutors are both canonical and field-defining. She stands with **Thomas Kuhn** in denying that science progresses by simple accumulation, and with **Ian Hacking** in treating **classification** as world-making, yet she resists the antinomies sometimes imputed to **Bruno Latour’s** symmetry by insisting on the constraining force of **institutions** and **law**. From **Brian Wynne** and **Harry Collins** she learns the socialization of expertise and the limits of the deficit model, while her comparative tilt positions her to engage **Habermas** and **Beck** on deliberation and risk society without reclining into grand theory. The result is an approach that is empirical and hermeneutical at once, a jurisprudence of **knowledge** where the felt textures of **policy** and the formal structures of **authority** are treated as mutually illuminating. Her later reflections on climate, including A New Climate for Society in 2010, press the same point: **climate knowledge** is inseparable from **climate politics**, so governance requires redescription of both.

Method, concept, and case converge on a practical proposal. If **co-production** is the anthropological constant of modern technoscience, then democratic orders must cultivate **technologies of humility** to pattern the traffic between experts and citizens. If **civic epistemologies** are plural, then transnational governance must reckon with **incommensurable** repertoires of **legitimacy**, rather than presuming a unitary rationality. If **sociotechnical imaginaries** steer investment and identity, then critique must also be **poetic**, a contest over the public **imagination** of the good. The political theology implicit here is that of a bounded but real human agency, an *ordo* in which the shape of knowing is a function of the shape of **life together**. The normative residue is substantial: humility as a civic **virtue**, precaution as an institutional **discipline**, and public reason as a social **practice** that deserves as much care as any laboratory instrument.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation begins with substantial resonance. Jasanoff’s insistence on the socially embedded nature of **knowledge** coheres with the Reformed doctrine of the **noetic effects of sin**, which denies a neutral standpoint and calls for **accountable** communities of inquiry. Her emphasis on **humility**, **prudence**, and **participatory judgment** aligns with classic **Protestant** ethics of vocation and **prudential governance**, while her critique of technocratic hubris comports with a theology of **creaturely limits** under **providence**. Yet tensions remain. The thesis of **co-production**, if untethered from **creational givenness**, risks sliding toward a constructivism that cannot finally acknowledge an order of **nature** received under **covenant**. The Reformed anchoring of public reason in **Scripture as norma normans**, together with **natural law** as a mode of general revelation, demands more than procedural **civic epistemologies** can provide for adjudicating ultimate **ends**. A Kuyperian **sphere sovereignty** would also press Jasanoff’s state-centered comparisons toward thicker accounts of family, church, and intermediary associations as sites of **expertise** and **authority**, moderating both market and magistrate. A WTS-style **presuppositional** critique would welcome her demolition of neutrality but insist that all governance imaginaries be tested against the **antithesis** between worship and idolatry, lest **sociotechnical imaginaries** become rival eschatologies. A constructive Reformed appropriation would therefore receive Jasanoff’s **technologies of humility** as common-grace wisdom, embed them in a covenantal **epistemology** disciplined by the Word, and couple **precaution** with hopeful **providence**, so that the governance of technoscience serves justice without baptizing either scientism or skepticism.
