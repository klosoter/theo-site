### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to devotion
The career of **Larry W. Hurtado** 1943–2019 unfolds within the late twentieth-century realignment of **historical-critical New Testament studies**, marked by sustained reassessment of **Second Temple Judaism** and the origins of **early high Christology**. Trained in **textual criticism** with a celebrated study of **Codex W in Mark** 1981, Hurtado taught at the **University of Manitoba** 1975–1996 before becoming Professor of **New Testament Language, Literature and Theology** at **Edinburgh** 1996–2011. He founded the **Centre for the Study of Christian Origins**, positioning his scholarship at the intersection of **exegesis**, **material culture**, and the **history of early Christian worship**. Against the lingering influence of **Wilhelm Bousset’s Kyrios Christos** thesis that Hellenistic cults birthed Christian worship of Jesus, Hurtado developed a historical picture that locates the decisive developments in the **Jerusalem and Pauline** circles of the 30s and 40s. In dialogue with **Martin Hengel** on precocious **Christological developments**, and against incrementalist proposals associated with **James D. G. Dunn**, Hurtado articulated a clear thesis: the earliest churches manifested a **dyadic devotional pattern** that is both thoroughly **monotheistic** and yet centered on the **Lord Jesus** as rightful recipient of **cultic devotion**.

Hurtado’s historical world is the reappraised landscape of **Second Temple Jewish monotheism**, understood not as abstract metaphysics but as **exclusive worship practice** directed to the one **God of Israel**. Within this field of strong **iconic and cultic boundaries**, the earliest believers included **Jesus** in acts of worship that Jews reserved for God alone. This move, Hurtado argued, is best described as a **mutation in worship** rather than an importation of **pagan veneration**. His guiding concern is not merely the semantics of **christological titles** but the concrete **cultic repertoire** of the earliest congregations. In this move from words to worship, Hurtado’s scholarship reframed the question of **Christology**: not primarily, what ontological categories did Christians confess, but whom did they **invoke**, **sing to**, **pray to**, and **confess** in their assemblies. The answer, evidenced across the **Pauline letters**, **Revelation**, and early hymnody such as **Philippians 2.6–11**, is the striking centrality of **Jesus as Lord**, integrated into **Jewish monotheistic devotion** without surrender of **divine uniqueness**.

#### 2. Method: artifacts, practice, and the bracketing of metaphysics
Hurtado’s method is avowedly **historical-critical**, combining exegesis of **New Testament texts** with the analysis of **material artifacts**. In **The Earliest Christian Artifacts** 2006, he argues that features like **nomina sacra** and the early Christian preference for the **codex** rather than the roll are not quaint scribal trivia but indicators of **Jesus-devotion** and communal identity. The contracted divine names **IHS**, **KS**, **THS**, and others function as visual reverence markers, and the **codex** signals an intense **bookishness** oriented to Scripture and apostolic writings. These **manuscript phenomena** both evidence and reinforce a **devotional culture** in which **Jesus** is confessed, invoked, and honored.

This methodological choice entails a principled bracketing of **post-biblical metaphysics**. Hurtado does not deny later **Nicene** refinements, yet he insists that the historian must account for what can be shown from first-century **practice**. He therefore privileges cultic acts such as **prayer in Jesus’ name**, the **Lord’s Supper** as a meal oriented to the **risen Lord**, **baptism into Christ**, the acclamation **Maranatha**, and **confessional formulas** like 1 Corinthians 8.6. Explanations for these practices draw on **religious experience** of the **risen Jesus** and the **Spirit**, along with early **scriptural exegesis** that rereads **Israel’s Scriptures** Christologically. His disciplinary posture is that **devotion drives doctrine**, so that the sustained worship of **Jesus as Lord** created the conceptual pressure that later yielded conciliar definitions of *homoousios* and **triune confession**.

#### 3. One God, One Lord and the articulation of dyadic worship
The seminal work **One God, One Lord** 1988, revised 1998, sets the agenda. Hurtado contests **Bousset’s** thesis that the title **Kyrios** and cultic veneration were Hellenistic grafts, proposing instead an origin within early **Jewish-Christian** circles. He highlights how passages such as **Philippians 2** and **1 Corinthians 8.6** reconfigure **Israel’s monotheistic confession** around **Jesus** without compromising the one **God the Father**. The central construct is the **dyadic devotional pattern**: God and Jesus together receive cultic honor, which in Jewish practice belonged only to God, with the **Spirit** often present as empowering agent rather than recipient of worship. This dyadic pattern is not a late development but is stabilised in the earliest strata we can access, thereby overturning evolutionary schemas that move from prophet to demigod to deified Lord.

Hurtado treats **hymns**, **prayers**, and **invocations** as the primary witnesses to this dyadic phenomenon. He notes how **YHWH texts** are applied to **Jesus** in **early Christian exegesis**, and how acclamations like **Jesus is Lord** signal more than honorifics. The shift is cultic and social, evident in **baptismal practice**, **Eucharistic confession**, and the **renunciation of idols** that **Destroyer of the Gods** 2016 later explores. For Hurtado, these practices express a robust **exclusive monotheism** in which **Jesus** is uniquely distinguished from all creatures and integrated into the **worship of the one God**, a move that stands without precedent in **Second Temple Judaism** and that calls for an historical account adequate to its speed and depth.

#### 4. Lord Jesus Christ: thick description of earliest devotion
The magisterial **Lord Jesus Christ** 2003 expands the thesis through a comprehensive mapping of **Jesus-devotion** across first- and early second-century sources. Hurtado catalogs the recurring elements of the **cultic repertoire**: collective **prayer to Jesus** 1 Thessalonians 3.11–13, 2 Thessalonians 2.16–17, **hymn-singing** directed to Christ, **invocation of the name** for healing and exorcism, **prophetic oracles** in which the risen **Jesus** addresses congregations as in **Revelation**, and the **sacral meal** understood as fellowship with the **Lord**. He reads **Paul** as presupposing an already **high Christology** and argues that by the 50s the churches operate with an **institutionalized worship** of Jesus, which is further diffused by **mission** and **letter-exchange**.

A notable feature is Hurtado’s unembarrassed appeal to **religious experience** as part of the historical explanation for such rapid development. Early believers testify to **visions of the risen Christ**, to the **Spirit’s charismatic work**, and to providential signs, all mediated by an intense **scriptural hermeneutic** that rereads **Isaiah**, **Psalms**, and **Zechariah** in light of the crucified and exalted **Kyrios**. For Hurtado, the interplay of **experience** and **exegesis** rendered it not merely possible but inevitable that communities would offer **cultic worship** to **Jesus** while insisting they were not abandoning **monotheism**. The result is a crystallized **dyadic pattern** that functions with remarkable stability across diverse settings, from **Jerusalem** to **Antioch** to **Corinth**.

#### 5. Artifacts and social distinctiveness: manuscripts, codices, and exclusivity
In **The Earliest Christian Artifacts** 2006 and the cultural study **Destroyer of the Gods** 2016, Hurtado widens the lens to show how **manuscript culture** and **social practices** cemented **Jesus-devotion**. The unusually early preference for the **codex** suggests a self-conscious **book culture** that bundled **Scripture**, **Gospel**, and **apostolic letters** into portable collections for reading and catechesis. The **nomina sacra** bear a twofold witness, signaling reverence and standardizing a distinct **scribal convention** around the divine **Name** and the **Lord Jesus**. These material features testify that devotion was not only spoken and sung but **inscribed** and **handled**, providing an embodied dimension to **Christological confession**.

Hurtado’s social analysis underscores how **exclusive monotheism** sharpened Christian difference in the **Roman religious marketplace**. Refusal to honor the gods, rewriting of loyalty scripts around **Jesus as Kyrios**, and the formation of translocal **associations** with distinctive **ethics** confronted the empire with a novel religious subject. This early exclusivity, Hurtado argues, is unintelligible apart from the dyadic orientation of **worship**. In these studies he offers a corrective to accounts that render **doctrine** the primary driver of social boundary-making, insisting that **devotional practice** and **material culture** are historically determinative.

#### 6. God in New Testament Theology and the limits of dyadic language
In **God in New Testament Theology** 2010, Hurtado clarifies that **Theos** in the New Testament most commonly designates **the Father**, and that **Jesus** is not a second God but the unique **Lord** who shares the **divine prerogatives** and receives **cultic honor**. He emphasizes **triadic patterns** in benedictions and formulas, while maintaining that the earliest **cultic focus** is **dyadic**, with the **Spirit** as the empowering presence rather than an explicit recipient of worship. This does not deny the trajectory toward **Nicene trinitarianism**, but it situates the historian’s account within the textual phenomena of the first century.

Hurtado repeatedly resists simplistic binaries of **functional versus ontological Christology**. He argues that sustained **cultic practice** implies robust claims about **Jesus’ status**, yet he does not frontload later **metaphysical categories**. The import is methodological. The historian demonstrates that the earliest churches worshiped **Jesus** in ways previously reserved for **God**, and that this **worship** was understood as faithful to **Jewish monotheism**. The theologian may go on to draw **ontological inferences**, but the intervening step is to see how **practice**, **scriptural rereading**, and **experience** generated a durable **devotional configuration** that demanded conceptual articulation in later centuries, for which *homoousios* would eventually serve as a hermeneutical crystallization.

#### 7. Interlocutors: Bousset, Dunn, Bauckham, and beyond
Hurtado’s constructive edge is sharpened by sustained engagement with **Wilhelm Bousset**, whose **Kyrios Christos** had placed the origins of **Jesus-devotion** in Hellenistic cultic syncretism. Hurtado’s critique shows that the decisive innovations arise within **Jewish-Christian** communities shaped by **Scripture** and **exclusive monotheism**. In debate with **James D. G. Dunn’s** **Christology in the Making** 1980, Hurtado resists a gradualist account that sees initial **exaltation Christology** with later divinization, insisting that the early 30s and 40s already show **cultic worship** of **Jesus**. With **Richard Bauckham’s** **divine identity Christology**, Hurtado shares an affirmation of **early high Christology** yet differs in emphasis. Bauckham reads **1 Corinthians 8.6** as Jesus’ inclusion in the **divine identity**, whereas Hurtado prioritizes the **devotional repertoire** as the most probative evidence of inclusion. Their approaches are complementary, a **conceptual identity model** and a **cultic devotion model**, each offering distinct heuristics for the same canonical data.

Engagements with **Bart D. Ehrman** and others show Hurtado’s capacity for public-facing defense of **early high Christology**. In **How on Earth Did Jesus Become a God?** 2005 and **Honoring the Son** 2018, he distills his thesis for broader audiences, emphasizing the suddenness and distinctiveness of **Jesus-devotion** vis-a-vis **pagan emperor cults** and **Jewish angel veneration**. Hurtado argues that neither **angelology** nor **heavenly intermediaries** account for the **cultic worship** of **Jesus**. The early communities reconfigure the **Shema** in their practices, as seen in acts of worship and **YHWH texts** applied to Christ, and they do so while maintaining the singularity of **the God of Israel**.

#### 8. Doctrinal import and limits: from devotion to dogma
For **systematic theology**, Hurtado’s work establishes a crucial historical datum: the **worship of Jesus** belongs to the **earliest stratum** of Christian practice, is grounded in **Jewish monotheism**, and is not the byproduct of **Hellenistic deification**. This datum strengthens the plausibility of later **Nicene and Chalcedonian** articulations, since dogma then functions as the disciplined conceptualization of an already entrenched **devotional reality**. Hurtado’s language of a **devotional mutation** in **monotheism** accounts for how theology could move quickly from **Pascha** to **cultic veneration**, and from **apostolic exegesis** to stabilized **confessional patterns**. His work thereby presses the theological claim that confession of **Jesus as Kyrios** is inseparable from **worship**, making **christology** immediately **doxological** and **ecclesial**.

At the same time, the method’s reticence about **ontology** yields limits. Hurtado underscores **dyadic worship** more than fully articulated **trinitarian doxology**, and he locates the **Spirit** primarily as the empowering presence within worship rather than as a co-recipient of **cultic honor**. He is aware of **triadic formulas**, yet his explanatory framework privileges those practices most densely evidenced in the first century. Theologians drawing upon his work must therefore move from **cultic data** to **metaphysical judgments**, recognizing that **early worship** and **later dogma** are not competitors but different orders of **Christian truth**, one **historical and liturgical**, the other **doctrinal and metaphysical**. Hurtado’s legacy is an invitation to read the **New Testament** as a field of **worshipful praxis** whose logic demands robust **trinitarian confession**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation: revelation, ontology, and devotion
Reformed theology, especially in a **Westminster** stream, can warmly receive Hurtado’s central claim that **Jesus is worshiped** at the origins of the church and that this worship arises within **biblical monotheism**. This aligns with a **Vosian** emphasis on **redemptive history** and the canonical unity of **revelation**, and it challenges evolutionary narratives that undermine **Christ’s lordship**. Yet a **Reformed** critique will note the methodological bracketing of **revelation’s principium** and the reluctance to state **ontological conclusions**. By foregrounding **religious experience** and **practice** as historical causes, Hurtado under-weights the primacy of **inscripturated revelation**, the **self-authentication of Scripture**, and the covenantal structure of worship in the **covenant of grace**. In classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, worship of the **Son** entails confession of the **Son’s consubstantiality** with the **Father** and the **Spirit**, not as a later overlay but as the necessary entailment of the biblical **analogia fidei**. The early **dyadic repertoire** should be read as a triune economy already in motion, with the **Spirit** as agent and recipient of **glory**, and with **Christ’s mediatorial office** grounding the church’s **cultus**. Hurtado’s account provides indispensable historical scaffolding; the **Reformed alternative** would anchor the same data more explicitly in **special revelation**, the **lordship of the triune God**, and the inferential necessity of **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** ontology for the church’s confessed and enacted **worship**.
