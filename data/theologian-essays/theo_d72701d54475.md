### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul K. Jewett, 1920 to 1991, stands as a representative voice of **neo-evangelical** theology shaped by the ferment of mid-twentieth-century American Protestantism, the rise of **Fuller Theological Seminary**, and a critical yet faithful appropriation of **Barth** and **Brunner**. Situated within the Fuller project that sought scholarly credibility without surrendering **evangelical** conviction, Jewett pressed for a dogmatics responsive to **historical consciousness**, scientifically literate, and ecclesially accountable. His location within the Fuller faculty from the 1950s until his death placed him amid the well-known intramural disputes over **biblical inerrancy**, **hermeneutics**, and the mission of the seminary, and he consistently argued for a **Christocentric** method of **revelation** in which the **incarnation** norms the mode of Scripture as **divine speech in human words**. In this context he adopted a chastened confidence in **historical-critical exegesis**, rejecting both positivist **biblicism** and liberal skepticism, and he articulated a robust **accommodation** motif that aligned both with **Calvin** and in measure with **Barth** on Scripture as a human witness taken up by the **Spirit**.

Methodologically Jewett wove together the *analogia fidei* as rule of faith with a disciplined sensitivity to the **cultural-linguistic** horizons of biblical authors, yielding what he called **limited inerrancy** or **infallibility in matters of faith and practice**, and he insisted that the **gospel kerygma** bears normative authority even where its historical-clothing proves time-bound. This epistemic stance shaped his entire corpus, from his work on **revelation** and **creation** to controversial theses concerning **gender**, **ordination**, and **baptism**. He was neither a fideist nor a rationalist, but a **critical realist**, holding that **God's self-disclosure** comes through creaturely media that neither collapse divine truth into human error nor erase human historicity, an approach that enabled engagement with **Berkouwer** on **dogmatische problemen** and conversation with **Carl F. H. Henry** on **revelation** while resisting fundamentalist formulations.

#### 2. God, creation, and the doctrine of revelation
Jewett's mature dogmatic voice is most fully heard in **God, Creation, and Revelation, 1991**, the first volume of a planned multi-volume dogmatics. Here he set forth a **trinitarian theism** in which the **self-revealing God** discloses himself through **Word** and **Spirit** in the economy of **creation** and **redemption**. He affirmed **creatio ex nihilo**, divine **providence**, and the **imago Dei** as the theological grammar of creaturely existence, and he linked the **knowledge of God** to the economy of **revelation** ordered to Christ. The book's most debated pages treat **Scripture and inspiration**, where Jewett synthesized **Calvin's accommodation** with a modern sense of **textual plurality**. He defended the **truthfulness of Scripture** as reliably communicating saving truth, while granting **incidental historical or scientific error** where the Spirit has not pledged indefectibility. For Jewett, inerrancy is indexed to the **teleology of revelation**, the gospel's intent to bear witness to **Jesus Christ**, not to satisfy modern canons of **empirical precision**.

Within this doctrine of **revelation** Jewett articulated a functional **canon within the canon** without adopting Bultmannian existentialism, privileging the **kerygmatic center** anchored in the **death and resurrection**. The **analogy of faith** regulated exegesis, but he also urged attention to **genre**, **intertextuality**, and **redemptive-historical development**, engines that permit both robust doctrinal formation and an honest reckoning with **cultural conditioning**. In constructive form this yielded a doctrine of **God** marked by the **goodness** and **freedom** of the Creator, a theology of **creation** that welcomes scientific description under **providence**, and a model of **revelation** that is materially evangelical and formally dialogical with modern knowledge.

#### 3. Man as male and female, evangelical egalitarianism, and apostolic fallibility
Jewett's most influential and controversial book, **Man as Male and Female, 1975**, argued for **evangelical egalitarianism** grounded in **creation**, **redemption**, and **eschatological new creation**. He read **Genesis 1 to 2** as portraying the **imago Dei** equally shared by man and woman, the mandate to exercise **dominion** as co-stewardship, and the naming and helping motifs as mutuality rather than hierarchy. He then interpreted **Galatians 3:28** as a decisive **soteriological and ecclesiological** declaration that relativizes status distinctions in the body of Christ, the foretaste of new creation. The household codes in **Ephesians** and **Colossians** and the prohibitions in **1 Corinthians 14** and **1 Timothy 2** are treated as **culturally conditioned applications** of the gospel within patriarchal settings, not as timeless law.

The crux of Jewett's argument was his thesis of **limited apostolic fallibility** on social and ecclesial roles. He contended that the apostle's **rabbinic formation** and ambient **patriarchy** shaped certain prescriptive statements such that they fall short of the **creation-redemption** ideal revealed in Christ. This claim, joined to his **kerygma-culture distinction**, licensed the **ordination of women** and full **ministerial reciprocity** in church and home. Jewett engaged **Thomas Aquinas** on natural hierarchy, **Calvin** and **Hodge** on domestic order, and contemporary **complementarianism** emerging in evangelical circles. He offered a pastoral hermeneutic with rules for discerning **abiding principle** and **passing application**, urging churches to enact the **eschatological equality** of sons and daughters prophesied in **Joel 2** and manifest at Pentecost. The book became a touchstone for **Christians for Biblical Equality** and a lightning rod in debates over **biblical inerrancy**.

#### 4. Baptism, covenant, and the critique of paedobaptism
In **Infant Baptism and the Covenant of Grace, 1978**, Jewett turned the same **Christological and covenantal** lens upon **sacramentology**, arguing that **credobaptism** best corresponds to **new covenant** realities. He critiqued the classic **Reformed** argument that links **circumcision** and **baptism** as coextensive signs of one **covenant of grace**, engaging **John Murray**, **Pierre Marcel**, **Louis Berkhof**, **B. B. Warfield**, and **Calvin**. Jewett contended that **Jeremiah 31** and **Ezekiel 36** mark a decisive **eschatological intensification** of the covenant, relocating membership from **genealogical** inclusion to **regenerate** participation, thereby reconfiguring the **sign** to follow rather than precede **faith**. Household baptisms in **Acts** are, in his view, hermeneutically indeterminate as to infant inclusion, while apostolic paraenesis uniformly presses baptism as a personal, **confessional** act.

Jewett marshaled **Barth's** critique of **infant baptism** as an act lacking **subjective confession**, yet he remained more exegetically oriented than Barth's dogmatic polemic. He argued that **covenant continuity** is real, yet **new covenant** discontinuity in the administration of **sacramental signs** is decisive. The church is thereby composed of the **believing community**, and baptism functions as **sign and seal** of **union with Christ** for those who confess. He answered appeals to **household solidarity** and **apostolic practice** by insisting on the **normativity of apostolic teaching** on faith's primacy in baptismal identity, while admitting the prudential charity owed to paedobaptist churches. This treatise sharpened a distinctly **Baptist** covenantal account, dislodging infant baptism from the **Reformed** synthesis and linking the sacrament to **discipleship** and **ecclesial discipline**.

#### 5. The Lord's Day and Christian freedom
With **The Lord's Day, 1971**, Jewett addressed the **Sabbath-Sunday** question, locating Christian worship on the **first day** as a **resurrection** event rather than a simple transposition of the **fourth commandment**. He criticized **Puritan sabbatarianism** for importing Mosaic **Sabbath** strictures into Christian practice without adequate **redemptive-historical** warrant. In his view, the **Lord's Day** is a **gift of grace** for worship and rest, grounded in **new creation** rather than in the coercive structures of the Mosaic economy. He upheld the abiding moral wisdom of **Sabbath rest** while resisting the construal of Sunday as a **Christian Sabbath** with codified prohibitions.

This position cohered with his broader pattern: the **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ reframes legal continuities, generating **freedom of conscience** under the **Lordship of Christ**. He engaged **Lutheran** and **Reformed** debates on the **third use of the law**, urged pastoral prudence in setting communal patterns of worship and rest, and affirmed that the **Spirit** leads the church into practices that witness to **resurrection life**. His stance appealed to evangelicals wary of legalism and troubled **sabbatarian** advocates who saw in his approach an erosion of **creation-command**. In all this, Jewett kept a consistent focus on **Christological fulfillment**, **ecclesial unity**, and the **mission** of the church in complex societies.

#### 6. Anthropology, dignity, and depravity
After his death, Jewett's notes were edited by **Marguerite Shuster** into **Who We Are** volumes in the mid-1990s, notably on **human dignity** and **human depravity**. Here Jewett developed the **imago Dei** as royal-sonship and relational vocation under **covenant**, integrating biblical motifs of **dominion**, **community**, and **worship**. He affirmed **human dignity** as intrinsic, grounded in **creation** and confirmed in **incarnation**, and he connected **human rights** discourse to theological claims about **grace** and **neighbor-love**. At the same time, he elaborated **hamartiology** in Augustinian terms of **culpa** and **corruption**, treating **sin** as both **rebellion** and **bondage** with personal and structural dimensions.

Jewett resisted reductionist **Pelagian** or **determinist** accounts, expounding **original sin**, **concupiscence**, and the social deformation of **powers and principalities**. His anthropology kept a strong **Christological** axis, reading human destiny in light of the **image-renewal** in the **Second Adam** and the **Spirit's** conforming work. He interacted with **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and modern figures like **Kierkegaard** and **Reinhold Niebuhr**, all toward a pastoral theology that holds together **honor** for human persons and sobriety about **depravity**. These volumes show the same methodological signature: a normative **biblical center**, generous use of **historical theology**, and an openness to engage contemporary culture without ceding doctrinal grammar.

#### 7. Debates on inerrancy and evangelical identity
Jewett's stance on **limited inerrancy** placed him at the heart of the **evangelical** identity discussion in the 1960s to 1980s. At **Fuller Seminary**, disputes over the seminary's doctrinal basis and the meaning of **biblical authority** involved faculty like **Harold Lindsell** and administrators committed to classical **inerrancy**. Jewett contended that a viable doctrine of **inspiration** must affirm the **truthfulness** of Scripture in its divine purpose while acknowledging **phenomena** that defy a **mechanical** view of accuracy. He appealed to **Calvin's accommodation**, the **incarnational analogy**, and the role of **genre** and **ancient historiography**, arguing that insisting on modern **precisionism** risks a **docetic** bibliology. His formulation influenced many students and provoked critique from the **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy**, which viewed his position as a concession undermining **biblical authority**.

These debates exposed Jewett's central conviction that **Christological truth** and **gospel proclamation** carry the norming weight. He believed that the **Spirit** speaks reliably through all of Scripture, yet that the **apostolic word**, as human, exhibits **cultural-linguistic** features, including occasional **misapplication** on contingent social arrangements. The sharpest test case was his claim of **apostolic fallibility** on **gender** roles, which many evangelicals regarded as incompatible with any coherent inerrancy. Jewett pressed that the alternative risked absolutizing **patriarchal** mores as divine law, thereby obscuring the **eschatological horizon** of **new creation**. The ensuing literature, including **Piper and Grudem's** complementarian manifesto in the early 1990s, often named Jewett as a leading contrary voice, and the exchange clarified a fault line between **hermeneutical development** and **canonical fixity** within evangelicalism.

#### 8. Reception and influence across evangelical and Reformed landscapes
Across his career Jewett influenced evangelical discussions of **ordination**, **marriage**, **sacrament**, and **worship**, and he modeled a way of doing **systematic theology** attentive to **biblical exegesis**, **historical theology**, and **cultural analysis**. His **egalitarian** project equipped generations of pastors and scholars to read **Genesis** and **Paul** in light of **Christ**, and his baptismal work empowered **Baptist covenantalists** to mount exegetically serious critiques of **paedobaptism**. In the academy his dogmatic method, on display in **God, Creation, and Revelation**, showed how a **Trinitarian** metaphysic can coexist with a **critical** stance toward Scripture's human mediation, an approach comparable in some respects to **Berkouwer's** cautious correlationism and distinct from **Henry's** propositionalism.

In the **Reformed** world, reception was mixed. Paedobaptist theologians found his treatment of **covenant continuity** too discontinuous and his reading of **Jeremiah 31** over-realized. Confessional advocates of **Westminster** style **inerrancy** saw in his limited inerrancy and **apostolic fallibility** a rupture with the **analogia scripturae**. Yet many Reformed evangelicals appreciated his **Christocentric** focus, his defense of **creatio ex nihilo** and **providence**, and his pastoral use of **new creation** to frame **ethics**. His student **Marguerite Shuster** and others extended his theological legacy in **pastoral theology** and **homiletics**, while **Christians for Biblical Equality** and allied scholars often cite **Man as Male and Female** as a progenitor text for **evangelical feminism**. Thus Jewett's name remains a reference point wherever **evangelical** identity, **Scripture**, and **social ethics** intersect.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and especially **Westminster** vantage, Jewett's work offers both salutary emphases and serious tensions. Positively, his **Christocentric dogmatics**, his insistence on **revelation** as divine self-disclosure, and his robust commitment to **creatio ex nihilo**, **providence**, and the **imago Dei** resonate with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. His appeal to **Calvin's accommodation** can serve a chastened doctrine of **inspiration**, and his attention to **redemptive history** aids ethical discernment. Yet three fault lines remain. First, his **limited inerrancy** and especially his thesis of **apostolic fallibility** undercut the **self-attesting** and **self-interpreting** character of Scripture articulated as **analogia scripturae** and **inerrantia** within the **Westminster Standards**. The Reformed alternative would welcome **phenomenological** diversity, recognize **accommodation**, and deploy **organic inspiration** as in **Bavinck** and **Warfield**, without conceding that apostolic prescriptions can be doctrinally errant. Second, his **egalitarian hermeneutic** risks prioritizing an **eschatological ideal** over the **covenantal order** embedded in creation and expounded by **Paul**, where headship and help are construed not as fallen domination but as **order with reciprocity**. A Reformed response would read **household codes** as wise, redemptive-historical applications that remain normatively instructive, with local adaptations but not wholesale annulment. Third, his **credobaptist** critique of **paedobaptism** fails, in this view, to do justice to the **one covenant of grace**, the **corporate shape** of redemptive administration, and the biblical pattern of including **believers and their children** under the **visible church**. Reformed alternatives would reaffirm **baptism** as **sign and seal** to the covenant community, rooted in **Genesis 17** and **Acts**'s household horizon, and would construe **Lord's Day** practice within a **creation-command** sabbatarian frame. In sum, Jewett compels Reformed theologians to refine their account of **revelation**, **covenant**, and **ethics**, even as they decline his key departures on **inerrancy**, **gender**, and **baptism**.
