### ESSAY
Michael W. Goheen has emerged as a leading contemporary voice for a **Neo-Calvinist missional theology** that reads Scripture as a unified **narrative of the kingdom of God** addressed to late modern peoples. Formed amid the collapse of **Christendom** in the West and the rise of a polycentric, global church, his central claim is that the **Bible is the true story of the whole world**, a canonical drama that summons the church to a missionary vocation in every sphere of life. He draws deeply from **Abraham Kuyper’s** integral vision of **creation-fall-redemption**, from **Herman Bavinck’s** catholic Reformed synthesis, and above all from **Lesslie Newbigin’s** insistence that the gospel is **public truth** confronting Western culture’s idols. In the 1990s and 2000s, teaching in Canada and the United States and serving institutions shaped by Reformational thought, he helped consolidate a missional turn that integrates **worldview analysis** with **biblical theology**, challenging sacred-secular dualisms and privatized faith.

Goheen’s academic formation culminated in doctoral work on **Newbigin’s missionary ecclesiology**, later distilled as **The Church and Its Vocation** in 2018, where he set the axis of a **Trinitarian missio Dei** and an ecclesiology defined as **sign, instrument, and foretaste** of the reign of God. The influence of **Michael Polanyi’s** tacit knowledge, mediated by **Newbigin**, supports Goheen’s epistemic stance that Christian knowing is a committed participation in a **publicly testable** story rather than neutral observation. From **Al Wolters** and the **Reformational philosophy** of **Dooyeweerd**, he absorbed a critical account of **idolatry** as structural and religious at once, informing his analysis of modernity’s false absolutizations. From **Geerhardus Vos** and the **biblical theology** tradition, he appropriated the redemptive-historical arc that resists proof-text fragmentation and underwrites a **canonical** reading attentive to **kingdom** and **covenant**. These sources converge in his method: a narrative-canonical, missionally attuned **worldview** approach that acknowledges the church as a community sent into and for the world.

The platform for Goheen’s wide influence is a series of pedagogically savvy texts coauthored and authored between 2004 and 2018. With **Craig Bartholomew**, he published **The Drama of Scripture** in 2004, sketching a **six-act biblical drama** — creation, fall, Israel, Jesus, church, new creation — and inviting the church to improvise faithfully within the canonical script. The companion volume, **The True Story of the Whole World** in 2009, compresses the thesis for broader use, while **Living at the Crossroads** in 2008 applies **worldview** analysis to late modern culture, contrasting the biblical story with the rival gospels of **consumerism**, **nationalism**, and **technological progress**. In 2011, **A Light to the Nations** articulated a biblical-theological **missionary ecclesiology**, contending that Israel’s vocation and the church’s identity are seamlessly missional. **Introducing Christian Mission Today** in 2014 offers a map of global missiology, and **Reading the Bible Missionally** in 2016 provides hermeneutical warrants for a **missional reading** of canon. Coordinated with his earlier Newbigin work in **The Church and Its Vocation** in 2018, these books define a program: the gospel as **public truth**, Scripture as **mission narrative**, the church as **missionary people**, and culture as the arena of **kingdom witness**.

Central to Goheen’s biblical-theological contribution is a reframing of **mission** not as a department of ecclesial life, but as the church’s identity under the **missio Dei**. He recovers the **Abrahamic promise** of Genesis 12 as the structural center, arguing that God’s election of Israel is missional in teleology, aiming at the **blessing of the nations**. He traces this through **Isaiah’s** servant songs and Zion visions, through Jesus’s kingdom proclamation in the Synoptics, and into **Luke-Acts**, where the Ascended Christ sends a **Spirit-filled** community to the ends of the earth. He foregrounds **John 20:21** — As the Father has sent me, I am sending you — as the paradigmatic text, integrating **Christology** and **ecclesiology** within a participatory mission. **Paul’s** letters become, in his reading, not only doctrinal treatises but mission-shaping pastoral instruction that forms communities as visible embodiments of the **new creation**. The **Great Commission** is thus neither a thin call to proselytism nor a vague activism, but the comprehensive summons to live and announce the **kingdom of God** in word and deed.

The hermeneutical core of this program is a **missional hermeneutic** of Scripture. In **Reading the Bible Missionally**, Goheen argues that the canon’s unity is not merely literary but teleological: the plot of **creation-fall-redemption-new creation** renders the gospel a comprehensive **worldview** that rivals modern master narratives. He resists both proof-text biblicism and purely historical-critical dispersal by insisting on a **canonical** reading that is at once historically credible and ecclesially formative. Influenced by **Christopher J. H. Wright**, he reads the Old Testament as a **mission document**, not a dispensable preface. Drawn by **N. T. Wright’s** historiography, he underscores the reality of the **resurrection** as the decisive apocalyptic event authorizing a public claim about history. The church must therefore teach the Bible as a **true story** that can be embodied, tested, and proclaimed in public, refusing the **privatization** of faith characteristic of late modern Western societies.

As the narrative has public purchase, it also unmasks idols. Goheen’s cultural analysis, indebted to **Wolters** and **Dooyeweerd**, emphasizes **idolatry** as the root of cultural deformation: the absolutizing of creaturely goods such as market, nation, state, or technology. In **Living at the Crossroads**, he contrasts **biblical worldview** with the **Enlightenment** project and with **postmodern** fragmentation, showing how each erects rival soteriologies. The antidote is not retreat but **cultural discipleship**: a Kuyperian vision of **vocation** across spheres guided by the **lordship of Christ**. Here Goheen retrieves **Kuyper’s** notion of **sphere sovereignty** without baptizing any existing institution, commending the church’s formation of disciples who can inhabit politics, economics, education, and art as arenas of **kingdom witness**. He warns that **consumer liturgies** catechize the heart and so insists on ecclesial practices that cultivate a counter-public.

Goheen’s ecclesiology flows from **Newbigin’s** triad: the church as **sign, instrument, and foretaste** of the **kingdom of God**. In **A Light to the Nations**, he argues that the church is a distinctive people, formed by **Word and Spirit**, whose communal life interprets the gospel to the world. Against **Christendom**, he resists the presumption of cultural dominance; against **sectarianism**, he resists withdrawal into private piety. The local congregation becomes a **hermeneutic of the gospel** through hospitality, sacrificial love, justice, and verbal proclamation. The **sacraments** function as enacted signs of the kingdom’s reality; **preaching** locates the community in the canon’s dramatic plot; **catechesis** equips for missionary presence in workplaces and neighborhoods. The ecclesial shape is exilic and diasporic, echoing **Jeremiah 29**: seek the peace of the city while awaiting the **new creation**. This is neither a triumphal progressivism nor a despairing quietism, but an **already–not yet** eschatological stance.

Goheen’s synthetic clarity owes much to his dialogical posture toward modern missiology. With **David Bosch**, he appropriates the shift from church-centered to **missio Dei**-centered frameworks, yet he seeks a stronger canonical tether than some ecumenical theologies. With **Christopher Wright**, he affirms a **biblical mission** rooted in Israel’s election, but he accents ecclesial concreteness more strongly. Engaging **N. T. Wright**, he intensifies the narratival ethic for communal formation and public life. In a different register, he overlaps with **Stanley Hauerwas** on the church as an alternative polis, yet Goheen resists a purely sectarian politics by retaining **Newbigin’s** emphasis on **public truth** and missionary engagement. He also resonates with **Van Til’s** **antithesis** in worldview conflict while maintaining **common grace** space for cultural collaboration, a balancing act inherited from **Neo-Calvinism**.

Theologically, Goheen’s use of **missio Dei** is unapologetically **Trinitarian** and **Christocentric**. God the Father purposes the renewal of creation, God the Son embodies and inaugurates the **kingdom**, and God the Spirit gathers and empowers a people to participate as **witnesses**. The church’s mission is derivative and participatory rather than instrumentalizing God for human projects. This stance guards against both activism and pietism by defining **mission** as sharing in the triune life ad extra. In this register, Goheen re-centers the **gospel** as both announcement and embodied practice: not reducible to private salvation, nor swallowed by social programs, but a **public truth** that reconciles persons to God and renews the structures of life. His prose repeatedly insists that evangelism and justice, proclamation and presence, belong together in a properly **kingdom** vision.

Pedagogically, Goheen has been a bridge-builder, crafting curricula for congregations, seminaries, and lay education that translate **biblical theology** into **mission practice**. **The Drama of Scripture** and **The True Story of the Whole World** equip churches to inhabit the **six-act** story; **Living at the Crossroads** exposes the liturgies of **consumerism** and **technocracy**; **Introducing Christian Mission Today** orients readers to migration, urbanization, Islam, and the global South in the twenty-first century; **Reading the Bible Missionally** gives leaders hermeneutical tools to align preaching, catechesis, and communal practices with **missional identity**. In all of this, his refrain is consistent: the **church** does not have a mission; the **God of mission** has a church, so the agent of witness is not a program but a people whose whole life is subsumed into the **kingdom**.

Goheen’s constructive proposals have also generated debate. By framing the **gospel** as story, he risks, critics say, diluting doctrinal specificity into narrative form. He replies that **dogma** and **story** are mutually implicative, for the creeds summarize the plot and guard its grammar. By recovering **Kuyperian** themes, he is charged with **transformationalism** that over-extends ecclesial responsibility. He answers by maintaining the **already–not yet** eschatology and the pilgrim posture of **exile**, with the church as **sign** more than manager of culture. Likewise, his appropriation of **missio Dei** could be read as flattening the difference between God’s sovereign action and ecclesial participation. He insists instead on derivation: mission is given, not possessed. These tensions are not bugs but features of a project that refuses both quietism and over-realized triumphalism.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. From a classical **Reformed** vantage, especially as shaped by **Westminster** confessional commitments and **biblical theology**, Goheen’s work offers major gains and certain pressures. Positively, his **canonical** focus, redemptive-historical **kingdom** emphasis, and critique of **autonomous reason** echo **Vos** and **Van Til**; his diagnosis of **idolatry** and appeal to **common grace** resonate with **Bavinck** and **Kuyper**. His centering of **Christ’s resurrection** as public truth strengthens apologetic and ecclesial confidence. Yet pressures remain. First, the rhetoric of **missio Dei** can obscure the primacy of the church’s **ordinary means of grace**. A Westminster-shaped corrective would insist that **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **prayer** are not merely internal nurture but the appointed instruments of **mission**, ensuring that cultural engagement does not displace proclamation. Second, the robust **worldview** program may risk collapsing the distinction between the church as a pilgrim people and the **common kingdom** order, a distinction developed by some **Two Kingdoms** Reformed voices. A constructive alternative is a chastened **transformationalism** that honors **sphere sovereignty** while preserving the church’s proper boundaries and maintaining a theology of vocation under **providence** rather than ecclesial management. Third, the narrative accent can eclipse precise **ordo salutis** articulations, especially **justification by faith** as the legal ground of reconciliation. Here an explicit retrieval of confessional soteriology alongside the **narrative** would secure evangelical clarity. None of these tensions undermine the achievement. Properly integrated, Goheen’s **missional hermeneutic** can be harmonized with classical **Reformed** orthodoxy: Scripture as a unified **covenant** drama, the church as a **witness** through Word and sacrament, disciples dispersed as **salt and light** in all callings, and the **kingdom** awaited in hope rather than engineered by strategy.
