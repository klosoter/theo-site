### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Peter Sanlon emerges within **contemporary Anglican** evangelicalism as a theologian-priest whose distinctive contribution is to retrieve **Augustine** for the life of the pulpit, pressing **classical theism** into the practical grammar of preaching. His intellectual world is defined by late-modern **secularization**, the contested authority of Scripture within Anglican structures, and the global reconfiguration represented by **GAFCON**. Against the drift toward experiential subjectivism and managerial pragmatism in congregational life, Sanlon reads **patristic theology** as a school of pastoral wisdom, insisting that **doctrine** clarifies and orders love, and that **homiletics** must be saturated with the reality of the **simple, triune God**. His method is a deliberate **ressourcement**: he returns to **Augustine's De doctrina christiana**, the **sermones**, and the *ordo amoris* tradition to shape evangelical Anglican preaching, and he sets that retrieval within the authoritative horizon of the **39 Articles** and the **Book of Common Prayer**.

This **Augustinian** orientation makes his method both metaphysical and rhetorical. Metaphysically, Sanlon defends **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, arguing that the grammar of Christian confession requires these to preserve **Creator-creature distinction**. Rhetorically, he treats **preaching** as the ordained means to mediate the **res** of Scripture, the reality of God in Christ, through the **signa** of human speech, subordinated to **Scripture's sufficiency** and the **analogia fidei**. Theologically he favors classical **Pro-Nicene trinitarianism** with **eternal generation** and **procession**, correlating **inseparable operations** with Christological focus on **homoousios** and the economy of salvation, while resisting **social trinitarianism** and **process theism** that project creaturely passions into God.

#### 2. Augustine's Theology of Preaching: desire, rhetoric, and the God of the Gospel
Sanlon's monograph **Augustine's Theology of Preaching (2014)** argues that Augustine's sermons display a coherent theology in which preaching reorders **desire** toward God through the beauty and authority of the **Word**. In Augustine's idiom, disordered loves are cured by the right enjoyment of God, *frui Deo*, and by rightly using created goods, *uti*, within a new **ordo amoris**. Sanlon reads **De doctrina christiana** alongside the **Enarrationes in Psalmos** and **sermons on John** to show that rhetoric, when chastened by Scripture, becomes a **sacramentum verbi**, a tool through which the Spirit unites hearers to the **simple, immutable God** revealed in **Christ**. The claim is not that preaching is sacramental in the strict technical sense of the **Articles**, but that the preached Word instrumentally mediates the **res** of the promises, thereby forming **habitus** fit for holiness.

A key polemical note is sounded against modern homiletical tendencies that prioritize narrative technique, therapeutic validation, or pragmatic effectiveness. Sanlon argues that without **classical theism** the pulpit cannot sustain genuinely God-centered proclamation, because a God imagined as complex, passible, or temporal inevitably conforms to consumer expectations. By mapping **Augustine's** metaphysics of **simplicity** and **impassibility** onto pastoral rhetoric, Sanlon crafts a critique of **open theism** and **relational theism**, urging a recovery of preaching as the site where **doctrine** addresses desire and redirects the moral psychology of the church to the **triune** life.

#### 3. Simply God: classical theism for worship, prayer, and proclamation
In **Simply God (2016)**, Sanlon offers a constructive exposition of **classical theism** for parish life. He retrieves **aseity** as God's from-himselfness, **simplicity** as God's undivided actuality, **immutability** as faithful constancy, and **impassibility** as sovereign fulness rather than apathy. These attributes are set within a creedally bounded **Trinity** where **eternal generation** and **procession** safeguard the relations of origin, and **inseparable operations** secure the unity of divine action in creation and redemption. Sanlon engages **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and **Aquinas** to show that Christian speech about God is anchored in revelation yet disciplined by metaphysical grammar that prevents the collapse of **Creator and creature**.

The pastoral telos of **Simply God** is plain: worship must be regulated by who God is, prayer must be patterned by divine **perfections**, and preaching must begin with God rather than human felt needs. Sanlon applies **simplicity** to prayer by urging petitions that aim at God himself, not merely at gifts; he applies **impassibility** to suffering by reframing divine compassion as effective mercy rather than emotional fluctuation; and he applies **immutability** to assurance by grounding promises in God's unwavering being. He does so while appealing to the doctrinal form of the **39 Articles** and the **Prayer Book** collects, showing that historic **Anglicanism** presupposes a robust **classical theism** that fuels doxology and mission.

#### 4. Scripture, Anglican formularies, and the church's speech about God
Sanlon consistently places **Scripture's sufficiency** within the ecclesial scaffolding of **Anglican formularies**. He contends that the **Articles**, the **Book of Common Prayer**, and the **Homilies** render a normative doctrinal environment that aligns with **Augustinian** convictions about grace and with Reformation commitments to **sola Scriptura**. In polemics over doctrine of God, he resists revisionist readings of **Hooker** that domesticate metaphysics, arguing instead that **Richard Hooker** presupposes **divine simplicity** and **eternal generation** while clarifying the relation of nature and grace. The **analogia fidei** functions for Sanlon as a hermeneutical check on speculative excess, while the **analogia servilis** of creaturely language underscores that all predicates of God are analogical, anchored in revelation and circumscribed by the **Creeds**.

Within this framework, he argues that the church's public speech about God must be catechetical and homiletical at once. Catechesis supplies the stable conceptual grammar of **classical trinitarianism**, while preaching deploys that grammar to address concrete sins of disordered love. The result is a strategic integration of **dogmatics** and **homiletics** where doctrines like **aseity** and **simplicity** are not esoteric axioms but the living core of proclamation and prayer, echoing **Augustine's** insistence that right teaching heals and elevates desire.

#### 5. Culture, desire, and moral formation under late modernity
A distinctive feature of Sanlon's project is his Augustinian diagnosis of late-modern desire. He reads contemporary **therapeutic moralistic deism** as the liturgy of consumer capitalism and digital distraction, a catechesis into self-reference that requires a counter-catechesis of the **Word**. For Sanlon, **preaching** becomes the weekly site where disordered loves are named and redirected toward the **triune God** whose **simplicity** is beauty and whose **immutability** is peace. By retrieving **Augustine's** account of **concupiscence** and **gratia preveniens**, he insists that proclamation must be grace-saturated, exposing the will's bondage and announcing the liberating life of **Christ**.

Here Sanlon allies with **Reformed** moral theology at crucial points, though he articulates it in an **Anglican** idiom. Virtue is understood as **habitus caritatis**, a Spirit-wrought stability of love formed by the rhythms of **Scripture**, **Prayer Book** liturgy, and the preached **Gospel**. He is wary of moralism and valorizes the **means of grace**, especially preaching, as the primary engine of sanctification. This yields a pastoral strategy grounded in **classical theism** and the **economy of salvation**, resisting reduction of ethics to activism or identity politics by re-centering the church in the **beatific** trajectory of desire.

#### 6. Interlocutors and disputes: analytic, relational, and patristic options
Sanlon's constructive work engages several contemporary debates. Against **open theism** and **process thought**, he defends **impassibility** and **immutability** as evangelical doctrines that secure the trustworthiness of God and the efficacy of the cross. Against **social trinitarianism**, he argues for **Pro-Nicene** accounts of unity and distinction, grounding relations in **eternal generation** and **procession** and invoking **inseparable operations** to block projection of creaturely society into the Godhead. He is sympathetic to **Aquinas** in the doctrine of God yet maintains a Protestant insistence on **Scripture's principium** and the reformational corrections represented by **Calvin** and the **Articles**.

Regarding **analytic theism**, Sanlon appropriates its clarity while warning that without **classical metaphysics** analytic models risk fragmenting the doctrine of God. He contrasts analytic appeals to maximal compossible properties with **Augustinian** insistence on **simplicity** and the priority of biblical naming governed by **analogia fidei**. Within Anglican debates, he resists readings influenced by **Radical Orthodoxy** or certain modern Anglican proposals that aestheticize or historicize doctrine of God, contending instead for a steady **patristic** and **Reformation** consensus as the river in which evangelical Anglican theology must swim.

#### 7. Ecclesial location and the Anglican present
Sanlon's ecclesial identity as an evangelical **Anglican** has shaped his theology and public ministry, especially amid the turbulence of the 2010s surrounding doctrine and practice in the **Church of England**. He has ministered in parish contexts in the south of England and contributed to strategy and encouragement among orthodox clergy connected with the **GAFCON** movement and cognate realignment efforts. This ecclesial struggle is not incidental to his theology; it intensifies his commitment to **classical theism**, **creedal orthodoxy**, and **preaching** as the means of sustaining congregations under pressure. For Sanlon, fidelity to the **Articles**, the **Prayer Book**, and the **Creeds** is not nostalgia but the pastoral path through contested terrain, undergirded by Augustinian confidence in **grace** and **providence**.

In this setting he frames ministerial courage as a theological virtue formed by the vision of God. The **simple**, **impassible** God frees pastors from fear of institutional volatility, and the **triune** God who acts inseparably in the gospel empowers proclamation that defies cultural capture. Sanlon's public writing and teaching thus weds **doctrine of God** to **ecclesiology**, counseling evangelical Anglicans to stay tethered to **Scripture** and the formularies while extending fellowship within the global orthodox Anglican family.

#### 8. Synthesis: pastoral dogmatics in an Augustinian key
Across his corpus, Sanlon offers a coherent project: a **pastoral dogmatics** in an **Augustinian** key that retrieves **classical theism** for the sake of preaching. The pivot is always the pulpit, where the **simple, triune God** is named and loved, and where the Spirit forms **habitus** through the **Word**. By uniting **divine simplicity**, **eternal generation**, and **inseparable operations** with the **ordo amoris** and a robust **grace**-centered anthropology, he assembles a toolkit that is metaphysically serious and pastorally concrete. He insists that the grammar of **Pro-Nicene** faith is not a museum but a workshop for contemporary proclamation, catechesis, and consolation.

Sanlon's lasting contribution is to make abstruse doctrines audible. **Simplicity** becomes the ground for undivided devotion, **impassibility** the foundation for resilient hope, **immutability** the anchor of assurance, and **aseity** the humbling summons to worship. In this way, his work stands in the confluence of **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Reformed** Anglicanism, pressing doctrinal retrieval into congregational life through the everyday work of exegesis and sermon craft governed by **Scripture** and the **Articles**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/Westminster** vantage, Sanlon's retrieval of **classical theism** and his elevation of **preaching** as a means of grace resonate deeply with the **Westminster Confession** and catechetical tradition. His commitments to **simplicity**, **aseity**, **impassibility**, **eternal generation**, and **inseparable operations** accord with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, and his **Augustinian** anthropology of disordered desire coheres with doctrines of **total depravity** and **effectual calling**. Strengths include his Scripture-governed use of **patristic** grammar and his insistence that the **Word preached** is central in sanctification. Yet two tensions invite caution. First, where Sanlon occasionally leans on broad **natural theology** commonplaces to commend **classical theism**, a Westminsterian approach would foreground **archetypal-ectypal** distinction and a more thoroughgoing **analogy** of knowledge, wary of any independent **analogia entis** and insisting that all true theology is disciplined by the **covenant** form of revelation. Second, Anglican liturgical instincts sometimes broaden what counts as the **means of grace**, whereas the **regulative principle** in Reformed practice urges tighter scriptural warrant for worship and cautions against extending sacramental idiom to the sermon beyond confessional usage. On **autotheos**, Sanlon's strong affirmation of **eternal generation** is compatible with classical Reformed teaching when joined to **Calvin's autotheos** as to essence, and Westminster readers can welcome his stress on unity and relations provided the Son's personal origin is not opposed to the one simple essence. In sum, Sanlon offers a richly usable retrieval; Reformed theology can appropriate his **Augustinian** pastoral metaphysics while pressing more explicitly the **Scripture principium**, **covenant theology**, and the **regulative** shape of worship.
