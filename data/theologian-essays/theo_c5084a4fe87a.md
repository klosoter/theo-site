### ESSAY
T. David Gordon emerged as a distinctive Reformed voice by joining **media ecology** to **exegetical and confessional rigor**, arguing that the health of preaching and worship depends upon the media-shaped habits of readers and hearers as well as upon sound doctrine. Ordained in the **Presbyterian Church in America**, trained in the **Westminster** tradition that prizes **grammatico-historical** and **redemptive-historical** method, and teaching over decades at institutions such as **Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary** and **Grove City College**, he forged a vocation at the intersection of **pastoral theology**, **New Testament exegesis**, and **cultural critique**. The ordeal of life-threatening illness in 2003 lent existential urgency to his project, clarifying for him the non-negotiables of **textual discipline**, **covenantal preaching**, and the **ordinary means of grace**. From this crucible came a body of work that treats **preaching**, **worship**, and **Pauline theology** as a single field where form and content, medium and message, must cohere under the **Westminster Standards**.

Gordon’s method is a synthesis of **Postman’s media ecology** and **Vosian redemptive-historical** exegesis, executed with **Silva’s lexical and discourse sensitivity**. He contends that every medium inculcates habits of attention and judgment; therefore, the shift from a print-sustained culture to an image- and screen-saturated environment has impaired the church’s capacities for **close reading**, **coherent composition**, and **theological argument**. Drawing from **McLuhan** and **Ong** on the dynamics of orality and literacy, and from **Ellul** on the totalizing drive of technique, he argues that pastoral formation must consciously cultivate a counter-habitus if it is to sustain **expository**, **Christocentric** proclamation. His epistemic posture is chastened and confessional: reason serves **revelation**, exegesis is bound to the text’s grammar and history, and the church’s **creedal and catechetical** inheritance supplies tested conceptual tools such as **law-gospel**, **imputation**, and **covenant of grace**. The upshot is not cultural despair but disciplined retrieval, an ascetical program of reading and prayer ordered to the **ordinary means**.

Published in 2009, **Why Johnny Can’t Preach: The Media Have Shaped the Messengers** is Gordon’s pastoral manifesto. Its thesis is plain and unsettling: the decline in **preaching** owes less to homiletical technique and more to a generation ill-formed by **television** and **digital media** for the arts of **reading** and **writing**. He parses two core competences that robust preaching presupposes: the ability to read a text attentively, that is, to discern an author’s argument, tone, and structure, and the ability to compose a cogent essay, which is the skeleton of any responsible sermon. In a media environment hostile to sustained linear thought, sermons devolve into **moralistic anecdotes**, **therapeutic platitudes**, or **running commentaries** devoid of unity. Against this, Gordon proposes a recovery of the **classical rhetoric** of invention, arrangement, and style under the discipline of **redemptive-historical** exegesis that moves from text to **Christ** to the church. The result is theologically substantive **exposition** that refuses both mere information transfer and pragmatic entertainment.

At the level of pastoral habit, Gordon prescribes countercultural disciplines shaped by **media ecology**. Because our media train us to skim, scan, and react, he advocates slow reading of **Scripture**, **poetry**, and sturdy **prose** to recalibrate perception and judgment. He urges pastors to write often, by hand if possible, to recover the muscularity of **composition**, and to take as models the coherence of the **Pauline epistles**, the density of the **prophets**, and the ordered theology of **catechisms**. He critiques homiletical approaches that treat sermons as stringed pearls of insights or applications, calling instead for a clear **argument** that conveys a **text’s telos** in the economy of **redemption**. While appreciative of evangelical homileticians such as **Haddon Robinson** for insisting on textual big ideas, he contends that without the structural grammar of **covenant** and **eschatology**, such methods drift toward anthropocentric application rather than **Christocentric proclamation**.

Gordon extended his media-ecological critique to worship in **Why Johnny Can’t Sing Hymns: How Pop Culture Rewrote the Hymnal** in 2010. Here he argues that **contemporaneity as a value** has displaced **catholicity** and **objectivity** in congregational song, with **pop idioms** forming expectations that are affectively private, temporally ephemeral, and commercially driven. He contends that musical form is not neutral; it tutors desire and construals of God. Thus, the idioms of commercial pop, by privileging immediacy, novelty, and self-expression, are ill-suited to the **regulative principle of worship**, to **covenantal address**, and to **psalm-like** robust content. Traditional **hymnody** and **metrical psalmody** exhibit a form-content unity that sustains **doctrinal density**, **corporate memory**, and participation ordered by **lex orandi lex credendi**. Gordon’s diagnosis is not nostalgia but a theological aesthetic: the church’s song should be intelligible, catholic across generations, and capable of bearing **Trinitarian**, **Christological**, and **soteriological** weight without collapsing into private sentimentality.

If the media work diagnoses cultural liturgies that deform pastors and congregations, **Promise, Law, Faith: Covenant-Historical Reasoning in Galatians** 2019 supplies the exegetical ballast. Building on earlier **Westminster Theological Journal** essays, Gordon contends that **Galatians** must be read by what he calls **covenant-historical reasoning**: **promise** refers to the **Abrahamic** covenant that announces the **gospel beforehand**, **law** designates the **Mosaic economy** in its temporary and custodial role, and **faith** names the instrument by which those in Christ receive the promised **inheritance**. His careful engagement with the Greek text clarifies that the law in view is not law as moral principle but the Mosaic covenant as **paidagogos**, a guardian until **Christ**; that **pistis Christou** should be read as the believer’s **faith in Christ** rather than Christ’s own faithfulness as the primary genitive sense, thus safeguarding the **instrumentality** of faith; and that **imputation** is essential to Paul’s appeal to **Abraham** in Galatians 3. Gordon thereby defends the **forensic** character of **justification** and the priority of the **Abrahamic promise** over the Mosaic administration, while integrating this with **union with Christ** and the eschatological arrival of the **Spirit**.

In contesting the **New Perspective on Paul**, Gordon grants the historical insight that Second Temple Judaism included patterns of **covenantal nomism**, yet denies that this dissolves Paul’s indictment of universal human guilt under **law** or reduces **works of the law** to mere boundary markers such as circumcision and food laws. Rather, in **Galatians 3–4**, the apostle treats the Mosaic law covenant as an epoch of the **covenant of grace** with a defined, temporary purpose that cannot confer life and righteousness. Gordon disputes **N. T. Wright’s** construal of justification as primarily **ecclesiological** identification and **Richard Hays’s** emphasis on the **subjective genitive** of faith. He aligns with **Vos** and **Kline** in maintaining that the **Abrahamic** promise is the gospel in proleptic form, that the Mosaic **law** intensifies transgression and magnifies the need for **Christ**, and that the **Spirit’s** gift signals the inaugurated **eschaton**. Against **Federal Vision** proposals that blur **imputation** and **instrumental faith** within the visible covenant, he insists on the confessional grammar of **justification by faith alone**.

Gordon’s exegetical posture is shaped by the **grammatico-historical** method as refined by **Silva**. He foregrounds lexical and syntactic precision, cautions against fallacious appeals to word studies, and integrates **discourse analysis** to trace argument flow. Yet his exegesis is not atomistic: he situates Pauline argument within the **redemptive-historical** movements from **Abraham** through **Sinai** to **Christ**, holding together **forensic** and **participatory** soteriology by ordering them under **covenant**. This yields pastoral dividends. Preaching **Galatians** must neither collapse into antinomianism nor retreat to moralism; it must declare the **curse-bearing** obedience of **Christ**, the **imputed righteousness** received by faith, and the **Spirit-wrought** renewal that empowers the **third use of the law** as gratitude. The law’s civil and pedagogical functions differ from its normative role within the new covenant community, whose ethical life is spirited by **union with Christ** rather than animated by the **Sinaitic guardianship**.

The media-theological strand and the Pauline strand of Gordon’s work converge in his vision of pastoral formation. If **technique** and **speed** are the liturgies of our age, pastors must cultivate a counter-liturgical habitus that prizes **prayer**, **lectio continua**, **catechesis**, and **sacraments**. Gordon thus advocates curricular attention to **English composition**, **classical rhetoric**, and **literary reading** alongside Greek and Hebrew, and sustained practice in **redemptive-historical preaching**. He warns that strategies of church growth that mimic **entertainment media** undermine the church’s ability to maintain **ordinary means** ministry. His proposal is retrieval, not retreat: reestablish the **psalter** and **hymnody** as the church’s songbook, re-center worship on **Word and sacrament**, and resist the formative power of media that habituate the church away from **doctrinal fullness** and **catholic memory**.

Reception of Gordon’s work has been strongest within **Reformed** and confessional **evangelical** contexts. Pastors in the **PCA** and **OPC** welcomed **Why Johnny Can’t Preach** as a bracing word, often adopting his practices of reading widely, writing short essays weekly, and structuring sermons with clear textual arguments. **Why Johnny Can’t Sing Hymns** fed into ongoing debates about **contemporary worship**, with some praising his theological aesthetics and others charging him with insufficient attention to **cultural diversity** and the **missional** benefits of contextualization. In the academy, **Promise, Law, Faith** was noted for exegetical clarity and confessional candor, though those committed to the **NPP** and to a **pistis Christou** subjective genitive remained unconvinced. Gordon’s perch at **Grove City** rather than an R1 university kept him from setting large scholarly agendas, but his essays and books have quietly shaped cohorts of pastors and teachers who orbit **Westminster**, **Gordon-Conwell**, and allied ministries.

Reformed and Westminster evaluation. Gordon’s contribution is salutary where he binds **media ecology** to **covenant-historical** exegesis, preserving the **law-gospel** distinction, **imputation**, and **instrumental faith**, while summoning pastors to resist liturgies of **speed** and **spectacle** that erode **Word-centered** ministry. Two tensions remain. First, his critique of **pop idioms** in worship rightly flags form-content unity, but risks overstating a single aesthetic norm for catholicity. Classical **Kuyperian** accounts of **common grace** and **sphere sovereignty** could nuance his case by differentiating cultural forms without equating contemporaneity with triviality, while **Van Til’s antithesis** reminds us that form is never neutral. Second, in **Galatians** his strong epochal reading guards the **Abrahamic-Mosaic** contrast but can be read as minimizing the **third use of the law** if detached from his own pastoral clarifications. A full-orbed **Westminster** synthesis will keep his covenant-historical exegesis, maintain the forensic priority of **justification**, and yet articulate the Spirit’s **new obedience** with equal clarity. The alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is not aesthetic relativism or doctrinal dilution, but a principled catholicity in worship and a robustly eschatological ethic in preaching, so that medium and message together serve the **glory of Christ** and the **edification of the church**.
