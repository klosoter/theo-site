### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Felicia W. Song emerges as a contemporary Christian sociologist whose work is addressed to the formative power of the **attention economy** and the pervasive reach of **digital liturgies**. Teaching at a Christian liberal arts institution in the United States, she writes within the lived ecology of evangelical churches and classrooms shaped by the post-2007 smartphone world. The release of the iPhone and the ascendency of **platform capitalism** transformed not only communication but also the habits of perception, desire, and communal belonging. Song’s enduring thesis is that digital systems are not neutral tools but catechisms of a rival love, and that faithful discipleship requires recovering **personhood, presence, and place** as gifts to be stewarded rather than resources to be optimized.

Methodologically, Song blends **qualitative sociology** with a reflective **theology of technology**, turning to ethnographic interviews and cultural analysis to describe how people actually inhabit their devices. She situates her work within **media ecology** in the line of **Neil Postman** and **Marshall McLuhan** while drawing on **political economy of platforms** to name the structural forces that monetize attention. Theologically, she is Augustinian: desire orders perception, and the heart’s *ordo amoris* underwrites the mind’s attentional habits. Thus she rearticulates **theological anthropology** in a register attuned to habituated practices, leaning on **liturgical anthropology** popularized by **James K. A. Smith** to argue that the liturgies of swipe, like, and share are thick pedagogies of love.

Her intellectual formation moves from civic and communal concerns to explicitly theological diagnostics. Early engagement with the fragmentation described by **Robert Putnam’s Bowling Alone** sets the stage for Song’s first monograph, **Virtual Communities: Bowling Alone, Online Together** in 2009, where she tests whether online networks repair or intensify social atomization. She reads alongside **Sherry Turkle’s Alone Together** and **Nicholas Carr’s The Shallows**, but resists both simplistic **technological determinism** and naive optimism. Her procedural stance is chastened realism: technologies possess **affordances** that nudge behavior and perception in patterned ways, yet communities can cultivate **counter-liturgies** that redirect desire toward a thicker common life.

#### 2. Major works and doctrinal development
In **Virtual Communities: Bowling Alone, Online Together** (2009), Song probes the promise and peril of online sociality through empirical research and interpretive theory. She sees **networked individualism** simultaneously increasing contact and thinning commitment. The book’s constructive proposal calls for a renewed moral ecology in which practices of **place-based belonging** and **embodied presence** are not displaced by network participation. Her operative anthropology assumes that the **imago Dei** entails dialogical agency in time and space, not simply the capacity to signal and perform. The early volume thereby foreshadows her later insistence that devices exercise a liturgical pull on our loves, scripting us into the roles of content producers in an economy of attention and self-display.

The argument matures in **Restless Devices: Recovering Personhood, Presence, and Place in the Digital Age** (2021), where Song narrates how **surveillance capitalism** trains the self to be always on, always optimizing, and always available. She characterizes the smartphone as a portable sanctuary for a counterfeit **soteriology of control**, one in which the restless self seeks frictionless efficiency and perpetual affirmation. The book integrates **Shoshana Zuboff’s** analysis of data extraction with Augustinian moral psychology, pressing the claim that the crisis is not merely cognitive overload but disordered love. In this framing, the **attention economy** is a catechism that hails us as users whose value lies in click-through rates and predictive legibility.

Song’s signature contribution is to treat the gestures of contemporary media use as **digital liturgies**. Swiping rehearses impatience, endless scroll normalizes acedia, the curated profile shapes a **performative self**, and notifications punctuate life with pseudo-sacramental bells. By mapping these practices, she articulates a diagnosis of **restlessness** that is spiritual before it is technical. Here she interacts constructively with **James K. A. Smith’s** cultural liturgies while adding a political-economic layer absent in some ecclesial accounts: the rival liturgies are profitable. Accordingly, she resists boutique **digital minimalism** when it reduces the problem to personal time management, engaging **Cal Newport** appreciatively but insisting that ecclesial and institutional responses are necessary.

This insistence on communal response yields a practical ecclesiology centered on **presence and place**. Song commends a **rule of life for technology** that is not privatized technique but shared **ecclesial practice**. She advocates for Sabbath-keeping, technology-free zones in worship, rhythms of silence and face-to-face confession, and renewed attention to the **table and font** as loci of divine address. Theologically, these proposals rely on an analogical vision of **means of grace** where God’s redemptive presence dignifies created media like words, water, bread, and wine. While Song does not write as a dogmatic theologian, her program leans toward a sacramentally alert **doctrine of creation** and a pastoral **cura animarum** that treats attention as an expression of love of God and neighbor.

Beyond spiritual formation, Song broadens her horizon to the moral architecture of institutions. She names the structural power of **platform capitalism** to dictate defaults and incentivize addiction, reading with **Evgeny Morozov** against naive **solutionism** that imagines an app can heal the problems an app created. She calls churches and schools to enact **institutional accountability**, from procurement policies that avoid surveillance tech to pedagogies that prioritize slow reading and communal discernment. The aim is not a return to a pre-digital idyll, but the cultivation of **thick communities** that can resist the commodification of attention by embedding members in practices of shared patience and mutual availability.

At the level of Christian moral philosophy, Song tacitly reworks the classic triad of **faith, hope, and love** by refracting them through the triad of **personhood, presence, and place**. Personhood signals an anti-instrumental account of the **imago Dei**, resisting the reduction of the self to data exhaust. Presence names a rehabilitated temporality in which attention is a form of charity, echoing Augustine’s claim that love is a weight that carries us to our rest. Place accents finitude and locality, honoring the limits through which vocation and community take root. These emphases intersect with **Benedictine stability** and **Wendell Berry’s** agrarianism, yet Song reframes them for the algorithmic age where placelessness is profitable.

#### 3. Interlocutors, debates, and practical upshot
Song’s work proceeds in dialogue with a wide array of interlocutors. From **Neil Postman** she inherits suspicion toward **technopoly** and the erosion of cultural coherence; from **Marshall McLuhan** she borrows the maxim that the medium reconfigures social relations; from **Charles Taylor** she appropriates the language of **social imaginaries** to describe the taken-for-granted plausibility structures that normalize perpetual connectivity. She reads **Sherry Turkle** and **Nicholas Carr** as diagnosticians of fragmentation, but deepens their accounts with an Augustinian register that treats our distractibility as an **ordo amoris** problem. With **Shoshana Zuboff** and **Tim Wu’s The Attention Merchants**, she absorbs a political economy that renders love measurable and salable, which is why repentance must be communal and often institutional.

In ecclesial terms, Song’s vision aligns with **Jamie Smith’s** argument that we are storied and habituated before we are rationally persuaded, yet she adds a critical note: rival liturgies are not only cultural but engineered for profit. Where **Andy Crouch** casts a compelling vision of households as centers of **tech-wise** wisdom, Song stresses the need for congregational and educational rules that remove temptation from the default. Where **Cal Newport** counsels **digital minimalism** focused on individual craft and solitude, Song underscores that Christians are baptized into a body whose shared disciplines should be ecclesially led. The practical upshot is a set of **counter-liturgies**: analog Sabbath, device-free tables, shared silence, the recovery of craft, and liturgical worship that immerses bodies in a different time.

These **counter-liturgies** are not ends in themselves but pedagogies toward a revalued **imago Dei**. By training attention as love, believers relearn the grammar of availability that undergirds **neighbor-love** and hospitality. Song’s prose returns to the language of **restlessness** not to valorize productivity but to expose its captivity to a false telos. She calls for pastors, teachers, and parents to articulate a catechesis that names smartphone use as a moral practice susceptible to vice and virtue, and to organize shared experiments in simplicity that dislodge shame and cultivate hope. The detail that matters for systematic theology is not an exhaustive doctrine of technology but a textured account of how **providence** and **sanctification** unfold in the time-bound practices where God addresses his people.

#### 4. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed standpoint, Song offers valuable correctives and some tensions. Her Augustinian reading of the **attention economy** as a school of disordered love richly complements **Reformed doctrines of sin and idolatry**, clarifying that technologies are never neutral in a fallen world and that the **antithesis** runs through our tool use. Her summons to recover **presence and place** resonates with the Reformed conviction that God works through **ordinary means of grace**, where divine speech rightly claims our attention in preaching and sacrament. The emphasis on **Sabbath** aligns with a creational command intensified by redemption, anchoring device resistance in covenant time rather than lifestyle preference. Yet three cautions are in order. First, a Reformed **sola Scriptura** impulse will ask that the grammar of practices be ruled by explicit **revelation** so that counter-liturgies do not devolve into technique untethered from the **Word**. This requires transposing Song’s program into a catechesis that centers Christ’s mediatorial presence and the Spirit’s sanctifying agency, lest formation be confused with self-improvement. Second, a **two kingdoms** prudence will differentiate ecclesial practice from civil policy, urging pastors to lead by Word and sacrament while laity pursue just regulation of **platform capitalism** through common grace and natural law without collapsing church and world. Third, a robust **doctrine of vocation** will refuse both withdrawal and naive embrace, commending a discerning stewardship of technology under the **cultural mandate**. In short, the Reformed reception will prize Song’s diagnosis of **digital liturgies** and her summons to **counter-liturgies**, but will situate them within covenantal worship, Sabbath rest, and the sufficiency of Scripture as the rule for faith and life.
