### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andrew Gabriel emerges as a contemporary **Pentecostal-charismatic** theologian whose work sits at the intersection of academic theology and pastoral formation in Canadian evangelical settings, especially within the **Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada**. Writing across the 2010s and 2020s, his corpus answers the practical crises and aspirations of congregations shaped by **global Pentecostalism**, by the contested legacy of the **Third Wave**, and by public polemics such as **John MacArthur’s Strange Fire** 2013. The atmosphere is one of heightened expectation of **charisms** yet fatigue with sensationalism. Gabriel frames a response that he names in effect a **critical-charismatic** posture: openness to **prophecy**, **healing**, and **deliverance**, disciplined by a canonical rule of faith, communal accountability, and sober doctrinal testing. Theologically he operates with a **pneumatological realism** that insists the Spirit acts in the present, but his realism is chastened by the **already-not-yet** eschatology learned from New Testament studies and classic Pentecostal mission discourse. His method integrates **biblical theology**, **systematic reflection**, and pastoral praxis, treating *lex orandi, lex credendi* as mutually informing without collapsing doctrine into experience.

Within this frame Gabriel privileges the canon as norma normans for **charismatic discernment**, while recognizing the Spirit’s internal testimony, the *testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum*, as the Spirit’s witness in the conscience and community. He does not invoke the inner witness to underwrite novelty but to undergird sanctified perception within the church’s ordinary ministries of the **Word and Spirit**. His prose is intentionally accessible, but the architecture is dogmatic: he asks how **Spirit Christology**, **participation in Christ**, and **sanctification** condition a safe and fruitful pursuit of **spiritual gifts**. The result is a style of practical dogmatics that resists both thin pragmatism and unmoored enthusiasm.

#### 2. Major works and thematic architecture
The popular-theological volume **Simply Spirit-Filled: Experiencing God in the Presence and Power of the Holy Spirit** 2019 distills Gabriel’s constructive program. It surveys contemporary claims about **prophecy**, **tongues**, **healing**, **dreams and visions**, **angels and demons**, and **spiritual warfare**, situating them against a careful reading of Scripture and the catholic tradition. The book’s dominant aim is demystification with devotion: Gabriel lowers the rhetorical heat around charisms while raising the doctrinal depth by which they may be received. He insists that the Spirit’s **sanctifying presence** is as central as the Spirit’s empowering signs, and that **love as the telos of gifts** 1 Corinthians 13 must order all pursuit of manifestations. The book’s pastoral inflection is not an anti-intellectual move but the outworking of a **Pentecostal practical theology** that understands doctrine as wisdom for congregational life.

Alongside this, Gabriel’s more academic monograph **The Lord Is the Spirit: The Holy Spirit and the Christian Life** 2012 uses **2 Corinthians 3:17** as a hermeneutical locus for a Pauline account of **participation** and **sanctification**. In continuity with **Gordon D. Fee’s** reading of Paul’s **pneumatology**, Gabriel argues that the Spirit is the personal presence of the risen **Kyrios** mediating the benefits of Christ and transforming believers from glory to glory. The accent falls on **Spirit Christology** and on **union with Christ** as the matrix in which gifts, ethics, and community are cohered. The doctrinal lineaments of this book govern his later pastoral counsel: empowerment for mission and conformity to Christ are inseparable, because **missio Dei** and holiness are the two hands of the same Spirit.

#### 3. Scripture, tradition, and epistemic humility
Methodologically, Gabriel reads the Bible with a **canonical sensus plenior** that refuses proof-texting yet resists historicist paralysis. He uses biblical theology to map **Luke-Acts on Spirit baptism**, **Paul on the charisms**, and the **Johannine Paraclete** as a living pedagogy, and he places these within the regula fidei of the church. His engagement with **Simon Chan** pushes toward thinking of Pentecostal worship under the light of **ancient-future ecclesiology**, where the Spirit sanctifies time and bodies through patterned prayer, not merely through spontaneous eruption. At the same time he borrows from **Wayne Grudem** the distinction between canonical revelation and congregational **prophecy** as fallible, non-Scripture speech addressed to edification. Here his emphasis is epistemic humility: the community must weigh, test, and sometimes reject purported words using Scripture, wisdom, and the **discernment of spirits**.

Gabriel’s posture toward tradition is appreciative but non-romantic. He learns **discernment** from the desert fathers, **expectancy** from Wesleyan **sanctification**, and **missionary pragmatism** from early Pentecostalism. Yet he also warns against importing speculative demonologies or triumphalist healing theologies detached from **the cross** and **suffering**. The touchstone is the **already-not-yet** kingdom: all gifts are firstfruits, not consummation. This yields a pastoral ethic of patience, gratitude, and order that seeks the Spirit’s gifts while honoring the **ordinary means** of growth in **Word, prayer, and sacramental life**.

#### 4. Spirit baptism, tongues, and mission
On **Spirit baptism**, Gabriel navigates between rigid subsequence and reduction to conversion. He receives the classical Pentecostal impulse that **Spirit baptism** empowers witness in line with **Acts 1:8**, but he refuses to make a universal rule of experiential sequence, recognizing diverse patterns in **Luke-Acts** and the broader New Testament. He does not treat **tongues** as the necessary initial evidence, though he affirms glossolalia as a legitimate and edifying practice when interpreted and shepherded under **1 Corinthians 12–14**. Empowerment is clustered with **mission** and **holiness**, not detached as a discrete upgrade to individual spirituality. The Christological center from **The Lord Is the Spirit** reappears here: the Spirit’s baptism is participation in the risen **Lord’s** mission and character.

This integrative move is sharpened against both **cessationism** and uncritical revivalism. Against **MacArthur-style cessationism**, Gabriel marshals the biblical **charismata** catalogues and the continuity of the church’s testimony to gifts. Against revivalist excess, he insists that **love**, **order**, and **edification** are the Spirit’s own marks, so that any purported display that eclipses the **gospel** or divides the **body** betrays its source. Theologically, **Spirit baptism** for Gabriel is the intensification of our **union with Christ** for service, not the addition of a new salvific layer. This aligns empowerment with **sanctification** and prevents gifts from becoming badges of status.

#### 5. Prophecy, discernment, and fallibility
Gabriel’s considered account of **prophecy** is among his most pastorally consequential contributions. With **Grudem**, he distinguishes **infallible Scripture** from **fallible congregational prophecy**, the latter being authentic but non-canonical Spirit-prompted speech that must be weighed. He builds practical protocols for churches: leaders cultivate a culture of **discernment**, require that prophecies cohere with **Scripture** and the settled **gospel**, insist on edifying tone, and reject precise predictive claims that bind consciences without corroboration. The goal is not to mute the **charisms** but to foster maturity so that **1 Thessalonians 5** hold fast to what is good is realized in communal form. 

At the same time, Gabriel treats **dreams and visions** with pastoral sobriety. He acknowledges that the Spirit may subjectively guide through impressions, but he challenges techniques that promise guaranteed accuracy or manipulative certainty. He frames discernment under **wisdom** and **counsel**, inviting shared testing and the recognition of human psychology. This cautious reception of supernatural guidance is part of his broader **critical-charismatic** method: expect the Spirit, distrust theatrics, and submit experiences to the **canon** and the **church**.

#### 6. Healing, suffering, and the cross
In the domain of **healing and deliverance**, Gabriel threads hope through the needle of **theologia crucis**. He confesses that Jesus the **healer** continues to minister through his **Spirit** and his **body**, that prayer for the sick is normal, and that deliverance ministry has a place within pastoral care. Yet he resists reading partially healed bodies as failures of faith or unconfessed sin. The **already-not-yet** kingdom means that signs point forward without guaranteeing fullness now. This eschatological sobriety protects congregations from cycles of guilt and fosters solidarity with the suffering. He also unpacks **spiritual warfare** in a non-sensational key, emphasizing **resistance**, **truth**, and **steadfast prayer** over elaborate demon taxonomies. 

In this register he benefits from dialogue with **Craig Keener** on miracles and with **Frank Macchia** on **Spirit baptism** as an encompassing soteriological reality. The practical upshot is a holistic healing theology: ordinary medicine as God’s gift, intercessory prayer as love in action, and communal care as the Spirit’s embodied compassion. Gabriel frames the church as a field hospital sustained by **Word and Spirit**, not a stage for performative power.

#### 7. Church, worship, and formation
Gabriel’s ecclesiology is implicitly **charismatic-catholic**: the **Spirit** gifts the whole body for service, and the church’s worship is the matrix where the **charisms** are learned, tested, and integrated. He draws on **Simon Chan** to commend intentional patterns of prayer and catechesis, so that spontaneity is tutored by **Scripture** and the **creed**. Corporate order under **1 Corinthians 14** is neither a bureaucratic brake nor a quenching of the Spirit, but the atmosphere of mutual edification. He urges pastors to teach on gifts regularly, to model humble testing of impressions, and to normalize failure as part of learning discernment. 

Christian formation, then, is Spirit-driven and church-shaped: **sanctification as participation** in Christ is formed by habits of **hearing the Word**, **praying in the Spirit**, **sharing the table**, and **serving the neighbor**. The pattern is missional. The Spirit distributes gifts for the **common good**, for the church’s witness in the **missio Dei**, and for the love of the least. Here the hallmark of Gabriel’s work appears: a refusal to let **charismatic identity** drift from **discipleship**, and a refusal to let **discipleship** forget the Spirit’s generous power.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates
Gabriel’s dialogue partners are ecumenically broad within the evangelical-charismatic world. With **Gordon Fee**, he shares a Pauline center that makes the **Spirit** the experienced presence of the risen **Christ**. With **Frank Macchia**, he affirms the **Spirit’s baptism** as ecclesial and missional, though Gabriel’s pastoral register keeps the doctrine tethered to congregational learning. With **Amos Yong**, he appreciates a widened **pneumatological imagination**, yet he is more guarded about strong claims for the Spirit’s presence in other religions apart from **Christ** and the **gospel**. With **Wayne Grudem**, he accepts the fallibility of contemporary **prophecy** and the primacy of **Scripture**, though he pushes further in spelling out congregational safeguards. Against **John MacArthur’s** **cessationism**, he argues that the New Testament’s **charismata** never receive an expiration date and that the church’s history contains persistent if uneven testimonies to the Spirit’s gifts.

His academic writing in **Pneuma** and the **Journal of Pentecostal Theology** shows a theologian conversant with the guild yet committed to the church. He leverages exegesis, retrieval, and pastoral case studies to argue for **discerned openness**, an ethic that is both epistemically humble and practically courageous. This is, in effect, a proposed common sense for Pentecostal-charismatic ecclesial life: celebrate gifts, canonize none, and let **love** and **truth** govern.

#### 9. Contribution and reception
The enduring contribution of Gabriel’s work is a **critically charismatic** grammar that pastors, lay leaders, and scholars can share. By structuring **charismatic practice** under **Christological participation**, **canonical norms**, and **communal discernment**, he offers a path beyond the stalemates of polemic. His synthesis gathers the insights of **Pentecostal theology** and addresses the wounds of charismatic excess. Reception has been strongest among pastors and teachers in Canadian and North American contexts who seek a stable, biblically serious **charismatic spirituality**. The 2019 book’s accessible idiom and the 2012 monograph’s Pauline depth together model how contemporary Pentecostal theology can be both **popular** and **scholarly**, an integration once characteristic of early Pentecostal evangelists who were also Bible readers of formidable intensity.

The ripple effect is a renewed Pentecostal catechesis: congregations learn to articulate why they seek **healing**, how they weigh **prophecy**, and where **suffering** belongs in a Spirit-filled life. Gabriel thereby secures space for charismatic practice that is catholic in spirit and evangelical in content, under the authority of **Scripture** and for the upbuilding of the **church**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Gabriel’s theology presents both welcome convergences and principled tensions. The convergences are real: his insistence on the **sufficiency of Scripture**, his stress on **Word–Spirit inseparability**, his centering of **union with Christ**, his recognition of the **already-not-yet**, and his wariness of **triumphalism** all resonate with Reformed dogmatics. His nuanced account of **prophecy** as fallible and always subordinate to the canon aligns with a Reformed doctrine of revelation that refuses any parity with Scripture. His pastoral sobriety about **healing** and **suffering** coheres with a **theologia crucis** that resists prosperity distortions. The tensions, however, persist around the ontology and normativity of **continuing charisms** and **Spirit baptism**. A Westminster theologian would caution that even fallible prophecy easily functions as new revelation in practice, pressuring the doctrine of **Scripture’s sufficiency** and the **regulative principle of worship**. Moreover, the very category of subsequence in **Spirit baptism**, however modestly Gabriel employs it, risks obscuring that the Spirit is given in full in **effectual calling** and **union with Christ**, and that empowerment flows from ordinary communion with Christ through the **ordinary means of grace**. A Reformed alternative would welcome Gabriel’s call to discerned openness but would relocate guidance into **wisdom** and **providence** rather than into revelatory impressions, would ground mission empowerment in **Word, sacrament, and prayer** as sufficient instruments, and would read the **charismata** of the apostolic age as foundational and thus non-normative today, while allowing that God in sovereignty may grant extraordinary mercies. Within these principled differences, Gabriel’s **critical-charismatic** model still offers practical wisdom that Reformed pastors can adapt under their own theological convictions: pursue **love**, prize **order**, consolidate **Word–Spirit** unity, and weigh all things by the **canon** for the building up of Christ’s **body**.
