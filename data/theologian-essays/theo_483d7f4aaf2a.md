### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Scot McKnight, born in 1953, emerged within late twentieth-century **evangelicalism** marked by the rise of **historical Jesus studies**, the **New Perspective on Paul**, and debates over **biblicism** and **postconservatism**. Trained in New Testament at the **University of Nottingham** under **James D. G. Dunn** in the mid-1980s, he imbibed a **Second Temple Jewish** frame for Jesus and Paul that rebuked ahistorical readings of **justification** and **law**. His teaching posts at **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School**, **North Park University**, and **Northern Seminary** positioned him between church and academy, a liminal role mirrored in his blog and public scholarship at the **Jesus Creed** site. The shape of his ministry is best read as a consistent attempt to re-narrate **gospel** and **kingdom** so that spiritual formation, ecclesial practice, and academic exegesis converge.

McKnight’s methodological signature is a **narrative-historical hermeneutic** that treats Scripture as the unfolding **Story of Israel** climaxing in **Messiah Jesus**. Against foundationalist biblicism, he commends in **The Blue Parakeet** a **hermeneutic of listening** that locates authority in Scripture’s canonical discourse rather than in decontextualized proof texts. He self-consciously embraces a **postfoundational** posture that values history, tradition, and community while rejecting both modernist **inerrantist rationalism** and postmodern **relativist suspicion**. The governing categories are **kingdom**, **gospel-as-story** rather than **soterian plan**, and the church as the concrete social body where **salvation** is embodied. This method is indebted to **N. T. Wright** on **history and narrative**, to **Dunn** on **works of Torah**, and to **Anabaptist** convictions about the **church as polis** under the **lordship of Christ**.

#### 2. The Jesus Creed and spiritual formation
McKnight’s entry into broad evangelical consciousness came through **The Jesus Creed** 2004, which centers Jesus’ summary of Torah as love of **God and neighbor** as the scaffolding for Christian spirituality. Here the **kingdom** is not a disembodied ideal but the lived ethic of a community schooled by the **Shema** and the **Second Great Commandment**, which requires practices of **forgiveness, table fellowship, and enemy love**. The book’s thesis anticipates later work: the **gospel** is not a private transaction but a **royal summons** shaping a people. Works like **One.Life** 2010 and **Fellowship of Differents** 2015 extend this vision by treating the local church as the theater of **holiness**, **reconciliation**, and **mission**, offering an ecclesiology that resonates with **Anabaptist** habits yet remains within a broad **evangelical** orbit.

The pastoral edge of this formation agenda sharpened with **A Church Called Tov** 2020, coauthored with **Laura Barringer**, where **tov** goodness is proposed as an ecclesial culture resisting **clergy power abuse**, **celebrity dynamics**, and **institutional self-protection**. The theological spine is the **kingdom ethic** of the **Sermon on the Mount** read as community formation, not merely personal piety. The result is a practical ecclesiology where **virtue ethics**, **pastoral theology**, and **biblical narrative** converge, pressing the claim that a true understanding of **atonement** and **justification** can never be abstracted from a people who enact **Christ’s kingship**.

#### 3. Gospel and kingdom redefined
McKnight’s programmatic revision appears in **The King Jesus Gospel** 2011 and **Kingdom Conspiracy** 2014. He argues that much **evangelicalism** has traded the **euangelion** for a **soterian** reduction: a plan of salvation to secure individual destiny. The biblical **gospel**, by contrast, is the **royal announcement** that Jesus is **Messiah and Lord**, the crucified and risen **Davidic king** who fulfills **Israel’s story**. The appropriate response is **allegiance** and **baptismal incorporation** into his **kingdom people**. In this scheme, **justification** is a benefit of the **gospel**, not the **gospel** itself, and **kingdom** is not a free-floating social ideal but the concrete community gathered to King Jesus, that is, the **church**.

In **Kingdom Conspiracy** McKnight resists two misdirections. He opposes the **plebiscitary politicization** of kingdom language that identifies it with generic **social justice projects**, and he challenges ecclesial quietism that postpones the **kingdom** to a purely future reign. The kingdom is the **people-of-God-under-King-Jesus**, formed by Word and Table, practicing **justice, peace, and holiness** in a way that is eschatologically charged and historically located. The conceptual anchors are **Irenaean recapitulation** as a narrative frame, **missio Dei** as ecclesial vocation, and a pastoral insistence that **discipleship** is the necessary form of **faith**. The category of **allegiance** sits close to the Greek *pistis*, shading toward the contemporary discussion of **pistis Christou** as **Messiah’s faithfulness** that evokes and elicits human faith-fullness.

#### 4. Paul, justification, and the New Perspective
As a student of **James D. G. Dunn**, McKnight’s Pauline proposals belong within the **New Perspective** family. In **The Paul Debate** 2015 he maps the fault lines between the **Old Perspective**, the **New Perspective**, and emerging **apocalyptic** and **participationist** readings. The anchor claims are familiar: **works of the law** signifies Jewish boundary markers rather than generic moral effort; **justification** is God’s declaration of who belongs to the covenant family; and **union with Christ** is the lifeworld in which **sanctification** and **ecclesial identity** cohere. In **Reading Romans Backwards** 2019 he foregrounds the social fractures of **Rome’s house churches** and reads **Romans 12–16** as interpretive keys for **Romans 1–11**, thus centering **reconciliation, hospitality, and unity** in the letter’s argument.

McKnight’s posture toward more **Reformed** interlocutors such as **John Piper** is irenic yet revisionary. He agrees that **justification by faith** is non-negotiable but insists that the **gospel** is the royal proclamation of Jesus’ **lordship**, of which **justification** is a saving implication. He prizes participation and ecclesial belonging as central Pauline themes and accents **pistis Christou** as the **Messiah’s faithful obedience**, which relativizes purely **forensic individualism**. His **NICNT James** commentary 2011 exemplifies his sensitivities, treating **James** not as a problem for **Pauline grace** but as an apostolic calibration of **works** as the enacted wisdom of **faith** within a redeemed community.

#### 5. Atonement, sacraments, and ecclesial practices
In **A Community Called Atonement** 2007 McKnight rejects single-theory reductionism. Drawing on **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, **Anselm**, and **the Reformers**, he proposes a **kaleidoscopic atonement** in which **penal substitution**, **Christus Victor**, **moral exemplar**, and **recapitulation** each contribute to the church’s grasp of the cross. The integrating image is the church as a community that participates in and displays the reconciling work of **God in Christ**. This approach is pastoral and liturgical, urging worship and **Eucharist** as the habitual reception of the cross’s victory and forgiveness.

A notable sacramental turn appears in **It Takes a Church to Baptize** 2018, where McKnight defends **infant baptism** within a thick ecclesial and covenantal frame. He argues that **baptism** is incorporation into the **kingdom people** and that the church’s catechetical life must surround the baptized for maturation into **discipleship**. Though emerging from a broadly **evangelical** context, this move reflects a catholic retrieval of **sacramental realism** and pushes beyond low-church **memorialism** toward a participatory account of the means of grace. Together with an emphasis on **Eucharist** in his ecclesial writings, the picture is of salvation as God’s **covenantal embrace** embodied in a people who eat, drink, and live the **story of Jesus**.

#### 6. Scripture, women, and reading practices
McKnight’s **Blue Parakeet** 2008, revised 2018, offers his most sustained hermeneutical reflection. Against **ahistorical biblicism**, he urges a **narrative authority** approach that sees the Bible teaching us to live the **Story** rather than to mine texts for timeless rules. The watchwords are **listening**, **discernment in community**, and recognition of the Bible’s **storied diversity** that converges on **Christ**. He applies this method with force to the question of **women in ministry** in **Junia Is Not Alone** 2011 and ensuing essays, contending on exegetical grounds that **Romans 16** names **Junia** as an apostle and that the **New Testament** witnesses legitimate female leadership. Theologically he frames this within the **eschatological people of God** where **Pentecost** democratizes the gifts of the **Spirit**, pressing for practices that align with the **kingdom**.

The same hermeneutic appears in his engagement with science and origins. In **Adam and the Genome** 2017, with geneticist **Dennis Venema**, McKnight contends that **evolutionary creation** is compatible with Christian faith and that the doctrine of **original sin** requires reconsideration. He argues that **Augustine’s** reading of **Romans 5** can be differentiated from Paul’s, and he suggests adopting an **ancestral sin** model that acknowledges universal human fallenness without requiring a single **monogenetic pair** as progenitors. Here his posture is both historical-critical and ecclesially concerned: safeguarding the **gospel** from fragile scientific claims while retaining a robust account of **sin**, **death**, and **grace** focused on the **Messiah’s saving work**.

#### 7. Apocalypse, empire, and public discipleship
McKnight’s recent **Revelation for the Rest of Us** 2023, with **Cody Matchett**, exemplifies his pastoral-apocalyptic sensibility. He reads **Revelation** as a manual for **dissident discipleship** that unmasks **empire** and summons the church to **worshipful resistance**. The interpreter’s task is not to decode timetables but to cultivate **faithful presence** under the **Lamb’s reign**, thereby confronting idolatry in economics, politics, and culture. The book integrates his earlier themes: **kingdom** as an embodied community, **Eucharistic worship** as counter-formation, and **mission** as public holiness rather than culture-war triumphalism.

A related translational and pedagogical project appears in **The Second Testament** 2023, McKnight’s fresh translation of the **New Testament** aiming to let Scripture’s own **voice and cadence** be heard in new ways. The project exemplifies his commitment to the **church’s hearing of Scripture** and his confidence that renewed attention to words like *euangelion*, *kyrios*, and *dikaiosyne* can reshape how congregations imagine **salvation**, **lordship**, and **justice**. His publishing rhythm thus sustains a dual vocation: equipping pastors and lay readers while pressing scholarly debates on **Paul**, **gospel**, and **kingdom**.

#### 8. Integrations and through-lines
Across genres, McKnight’s through-line is consistent: the **gospel** is the royal story culminating in **Jesus the King**; the **kingdom** is the **church** under his rule; the **Bible** is a **narrative** to be inhabited; and **salvation** is personal and social, **forensic** and **participatory**, oriented to the formation of a **holy people**. His retrieval of **Irenaean recapitulation** supplies narrative integrity, while his debts to **Dunn** and **Wright** supply historical density for **Paul** and **Jesus**. On contested loci he presses for both-and resolutions: **justification** within **union with Christ**; **atonement** as a mosaic instead of a monopoly; **sacrament** as ecclesial practice not mere symbol; and **mission** as ordinary holiness rather than programmatic triumph.

At the level of ecclesial practice, this yields consistent emphases: **baptismal identity**, **Eucharistic formation**, **women’s leadership**, **tov culture**, and **pastoral accountability**. At the level of doctrine, it yields a re-centering of **Christology** and **ecclesiology** as the grammar in which **soteriology** makes sense. McKnight’s oeuvre thus functions as a sustained catechesis in **kingdom realism** for a disoriented evangelical public, insisting that the answer to crisis is not less church but a more deeply **kingdomed** church.

#### 9. Interlocutors and positions in debate
McKnight’s constructive work is constantly in conversation with **Dunn** and **Wright** on **Paul** and **gospel**, with appreciative yet critical engagement of **John Piper** and Reformed **forensicism** on **justification**, and with **Anabaptist** ecclesial instincts on **discipleship and nonviolence**. He retrieves **Irenaeus** for the expansive scope of **salvation** and revisits **Augustine** on **sin** and **grace** in light of contemporary science. He is also conversant with **Dallas Willard** on **discipleship**, **Michael Gorman** on **cruciformity**, and recent **missional ecclesiology** on **witness**. The cumulative effect is a proposal that is neither antitraditional nor naively progressive, but a thickened **evangelical catholicity** with a distinctly **narrative** and **ecclesial** center.

Disagreements crystallize where **forensic reductionism**, **ahistorical proof-texting**, or **individualist soteriology** dominate. McKnight’s critique is not simply polemical; it is structural. If the **gospel** is the **royal announcement**, then **justification** must be framed within a larger **kingdom economy**. If **Scripture** is **canon as story**, then ecclesial practices of **interpretation** must reckon with context, genre, and community. If **the cross** is many-sided, then the church must inhabit multiple **atonement metaphors** in preaching and catechesis. In each case, the constructive alternative is a thicker church, a fuller narrative, and a sanctified imagination.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed and WTS-style appraisal will warmly affirm McKnight’s re-centering of **Christ’s kingship**, his insistence that **gospel** outstrips a narrow **soterian** script, his ecclesial focus on **Word and Table**, and his integration of **union with Christ** with **justification** and **sanctification**. These emphases resonate with **Reformed catholicity**, with **Calvin’s** stress on **union with Christ** as the duplex gratia and with **Kuyperian** instincts about the **lordship of Christ** over all of life. Yet significant tensions remain. First, the reframing of **gospel** risks demoting the **forensic** center of **justification by faith alone**, where the Reformed, following the **Westminster Standards**, insist that the **gospel** principally announces God’s free justification of sinners on the basis of **Christ’s obedience and satisfaction** imputed and received by **faith alone**. Second, the proposal in **Adam and the Genome** to abandon a historical **Adam** and to reconceive **original sin** as merely **ancestral sin** strains the federal grammar of **Romans 5** and the **covenant of works** that undergirds **imputation**, threatening the coherence of **substitutionary atonement** as more than metaphor. Third, the **kaleidoscopic atonement** risks functionally relativizing **penal substitution** from the center to one option among many, whereas classical **Reformed orthodoxy** orders the metaphors around **satisfaction** and **penal substitution** as the judicial ground of reconciliation. Fourth, the **narrative authority** model in **The Blue Parakeet**, though salutary against proof-texting, can under-specify **Scripture’s perspicuity and sufficiency** and is vulnerable to ecclesial subjectivism unless normed by confessional **systematic theology**. Fifth, the identification of **kingdom** with **church** in **Kingdom Conspiracy** can be sharpened by a Reformed distinction of **twofold kingdom** and the already-not yet, protecting the church’s spiritual means even as believers engage public life under **natural law** and **vocation**. Finally, on **women’s ordination**, McKnight’s egalitarian exegesis remains contested within a confessional Reformed reading of **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 14**, where ecclesial office is ordered by **creational patterns**. The Reformed alternative would receive McKnight’s royal, ecclesial, and participatory emphases but would re-anchor them in a federal, forensic, and covenantal frame: the **gospel** as Christ’s once-for-all obedience imputed, **justification** as the article by which the church stands or falls, **union with Christ** as the encompassing grace, **penal substitution** as atonement’s dogmatic center, **Scripture** as perspicuous and sufficient in its own categories, and **kingdom** as both churchly and creational under the ascended **Christ**.
