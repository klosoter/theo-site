### ESSAY
#### 1. Contemporary formation and confessional orientation
Bryan Holstrom emerges as a contemporary teacher within the **Reformed** stream who responds to the pastoral and intellectual disarray of the early twenty-first century, a moment marked by the aftershocks of the **New Perspective on Paul**, the **Federal Vision** controversy, and the pragmatic minimalism of seeker-driven ecclesiology. His abiding aim is the recovery of **gospel clarity** through confessional catechesis, convinced that confusion over **justification by faith alone** and the nature of **repentance and faith** has pastoral costs in conversion, assurance, and church discipline. Positioned in the North American milieu shaped by **Calvin**, the **Westminster Standards**, and a broad Puritan retrieval, Holstrom seeks to teach ordinary Christians the apparatus of **confessional orthodoxy** so that they can resist both antinomian laxity and neonomian legalism. Theologically, his horizon is set by the canonical primacy of **Sola Scriptura** and the ecclesial authority of the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, within which he frames questions of salvation, church order, and spiritual experience.

Holstrom’s method exhibits a practical synthesis of **grammatical-historical exegesis** and pastoral casuistry, the latter understood in the older Reformed sense of wisdom for souls rather than casuistic legalism. He displays the Puritan instinct that clear doctrine serves tender consciences, so doctrines such as **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**, **union with Christ**, and the **ordo salutis** are not treated as scholastic curios but as pastoral instruments. The apologetic horizon is recognizably **Van Tilian presuppositionalism**: he rejects the neutral ground of autonomous reason and insists that **Scripture’s self-authenticating authority** must frame all appeal to conscience and culture. His voice participates in the ongoing Reformed retrieval that honors **John Owen**’s precision, **Thomas Boston**’s attention to the heart, and popular catechetical clarity exemplified by **J. I. Packer** and **R. C. Sproul**. In short, his epistemic stance is confessional, his hermeneutic is canonical, and his pedagogy is catechetical, all in service of a robust **evangelical** proclamation.

#### 2. The gospel centered in justification and union
At the doctrinal core of Holstrom’s project stands the nexus of **justification by faith alone** and **union with Christ**. He insists, with **Calvin’s duplex gratia**, that believers receive both the forensic grace of **justification** and the renovative grace of **sanctification** through union with the **homoousios** Son by the Spirit. Against reductionist slogans of cheap grace, he emphasizes that the ground of acceptance is exclusively the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, sometimes parsed in classic terms of **active and passive obedience**, and that this righteousness is received through **fiducia** that rests on Christ alone. Here Holstrom aligns deliberately with **Westminster Confession** 11 and 13, pressing home the difference between the instrumental causality of faith in **justification** and its evidential role in **assurance**. His catechetical materials rehearse the Reformed triad for saving faith as **notitia**, **assensus**, and **fiducia**, warning that mere assent apart from trust cannot justify, while also warning that introspective analysis of faith’s quality easily detours assurance.

Yet Holstrom does not abstract **justification** from the story of redemption. He appeals to the **historia salutis** in the death and resurrection of Christ as the eschatological event grounding the **ordo salutis**, echoing **Romans 4–5** and **Galatians 2–3**. By pressing the believer’s participation in the crucified and risen Lord, he holds together the **indicative** and **imperative**, ensuring that sanctification flows from union and not from self-generated moral resolve. In this way he resists both the **antinomian** tendency to collapse obedience into optional extras and the **neonomian** habit of turning gospel conditions into qualifying works. The baseline remains a classically Reformed **penal substitutionary atonement**, without which the language of imputation lacks anchorage.

#### 3. Repentance and faith as evangelical grace
Holstrom devotes sustained attention to the character of **repentance and faith** as evangelical graces granted within the **covenant of grace**. He retrieves the older Reformed description of repentance as **turning from sin unto God** with grief and hatred for sin and the purposeful resolution to walk in new obedience. His expositions often draw on the **Shorter Catechism** and **Westminster Confession** 15 to distinguish between attrition and contrition, warning against a purely horizontal sorrow that leaves the **holiness of God** unregarded. By pairing repentance and faith, he seeks to avoid the pietistic sequencing that conditions faith upon prior moral reform; instead, he teaches that faith unites to Christ and repentance follows as the Spirit-given disposition that reorients the heart’s loves.

In spelling out **faith**, Holstrom presses the integral role of **fiducia**. He is wary of decisionism that handles faith as a punctiliar act detached from ongoing reliance upon Christ through the **ordinary means of grace**. Thus, he sets **Word, sacraments, and prayer** at the center of the Christian life, not as human contributions to acceptance with God, but as instruments of communion with the living Christ. That emphasis aligns with the **Reformed** sacramental conviction that the **Lord’s Supper** and **baptism** are means whereby the Spirit applies the benefits of **the covenant of grace** to believers, strengthening faith as it feeds on Christ crucified.

#### 4. Assurance, conscience, and pastoral casuistry
A hallmark of Holstrom’s catechesis is his account of **assurance**. He follows **Westminster Confession** 18 in naming three grounds: the divine promise in **Christ’s objective work**, the **internal testimony of the Spirit**, and the fruit of **grace** discernible in life. He criticizes both perfectionist accounts that make assurance a right of every believer simply by logical deduction from justification, and mystical models that bypass the Word’s promises. For Holstrom, the architecture of assurance is evangelical and covenantal: Christ for us provides the ground, Christ in us by the Spirit provides the witness, and Christ through us by fruit of faith provides corroborating evidence. Yet he cautions that subjective evidence must never displace the primacy of **imputation** and **substitution**, lest tender consciences be driven back upon themselves.

This pastoral watchfulness is visible in his treatment of spiritual doubt. Holstrom distinguishes between **temptation** and **apostasy**, encouraging Christians to bring accusations of conscience under the light of **Romans 8:1** and the high-priestly intercession of **Hebrews**. He commends ecclesial tools such as faithful preaching, ordinary catechesis, and **church discipline** as protections for assurance, arguing that assurance matures best in the communion of saints under shepherds rather than in isolated reflection. In the register of **Puritan** physicians of the soul, his counsel is experiential without lapsing into subjectivism.

#### 5. Church, discipline, and the ordinary means of grace
Holstrom habitually locates the Christian life within a robust **ecclesiology** shaped by the **ordinary means of grace**. He contends that the church’s health depends on the weekly ministry of **Word and sacrament** administered by called officers, and that **discipline** is a gospel ordinance aimed at restoration. Against the consumerist liturgies of the age, he retrieves the **Lord’s Day** as a covenantal gift that frames Christian time around the resurrection. His practical prescriptions therefore commend membership vows, catechumenate-like instruction for new believers, and a trellis of elders and deacons that supports discipleship.

This ecclesial focus flows from his reading of the **covenant of grace**. Holstrom emphasizes that God ordinarily mediates saving benefits through visible means within a visible society. He critiques both rugged individualism that treats faith as a private intuition and sacramentalism that treats rites as efficient ex opere operato. In a characteristically **Reformed** register, he maintains that Christ is present by the Spirit through preaching and sacraments, not physically localized yet truly communicated to faith, echoing the **Calvin**-**Bucer** line against both Zwinglian memorialism and Roman transubstantiation. The church, then, is the Spirit’s school for repentance, faith, and steady assurance.

#### 6. Covenant, Scripture, and biblical-theological horizon
While Holstrom’s idiom is frequently **ordo salutis** oriented, he frames that soteriological sequence within the larger **historia salutis** of the covenants. Creation, fall, promise, and fulfillment mark his storyline, with the **Abrahamic** and **new covenant** relation in **Galatians** and **Hebrews** serving as interpretive poles. He leverages the **covenant of grace** to safeguard the gratuitous character of salvation across redemptive epochs, while noting pedagogical differences under law and gospel. This approach guards against the extremes of **dispensational** disjunction and undifferentiated covenantal flattening.

Hermeneutically, Holstrom is indebted to the Reformed **grammatical-historical** method tempered by a **Christocentric** reading shaped by texts like **Luke 24**. He seeks the plain sense while honoring typology, reading Israel’s exodus, sacrificial system, and kingship as adumbrations that find their telos in Christ. Though he does not major on the technical discourse of modern **biblical theology**, he acknowledges the Vosian insight that eschatology is seeded in protology and that history progresses to consummation in **Revelation 21–22**. This permits him to hold together the already and not yet in his account of **sanctification** and **assurance**.

#### 7. Atonement, law-gospel, and the challenge of revisionist soteriologies
Holstrom’s soteriology is consciously anchored in **penal substitutionary atonement** and the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, positions he defends against both **NPP** rereadings of Paul and the **Federal Vision**’s covenantal objectivism that blurs the instrumental role of faith. He stresses that the **law-gospel** distinction is hermeneutically crucial: law commands and condemns sinners in Adam, gospel announces what God has done in Christ for the ungodly. In preaching and catechesis, he favors a systematic pattern of exposing the sinner’s plight under the **moral law** and directing them to the crucified and risen Jesus, so that sanctification arises from gratitude rather than from a vain pursuit of legal life.

He engages the therapeutic moralism of contemporary spirituality as a thin Pelagianism that trades the **holiness of God** for self-actualization. Against this, Holstrom places **Christus pro nobis** as the keystone: only a crucified substitute who bears wrath and fulfills the law can release the conscience and reorder loves. Romans 5:12–21 and 2 Corinthians 5:21 supply his exegetical axes for this exchange. He thereby positions the Reformed doctrine of justification as both doctrinal granite and pastoral balm.

#### 8. Apologetics, mission, and public theology
In apologetics Holstrom operates within **Van Tilian presuppositionalism**, arguing from **Romans 1** that unbelief is not ignorance but culpable suppression of truth. He counsels evangelists to expose the borrowed capital of secular reason and to commend the **self-attesting Christ of Scripture**. While he recognizes the value of evidences, he refuses their elevation to epistemic arbiter status. The missionary implication is straightforward: preach **Christ crucified**, trust the Spirit’s sovereign work, and invite repentance and faith with the full authority of the **Word**.

His public theology is modest and ecclesial. Rather than elaborate a comprehensive program, Holstrom grounds social witness in the Ten Commandments as a summary of **natural and revealed law**, with particular emphasis on truth-telling, chastity, and Sabbath wisdom. The church’s task is not to manage history but to be faithful in **Word and sacrament**, manifesting an alternative polis shaped by grace. Here the influence of **Lloyd-Jones** and the pastoral sobriety of the **Puritans** can be seen in his refusal to substitute activism for holiness.

#### 9. Reception, use, and interlocutions
Within the **Reformed** world, Holstrom is received as a trusted catechist whose materials stabilize congregations buffeted by algorithmic confusion and theological fads. His essays and guides on **repentance and faith**, **assurance**, and the **ordinary means of grace** circulate in small groups, membership classes, and officer training, supplementing the **Westminster Standards** with accessible expositions. Pastors find his treatment of **church discipline** useful in reintroducing corrective and formative discipline as expressions of gospel love. Lay readers appreciate his careful path between **antinomianism** and **legalism**, as well as his repeated insistence on **imputation** and the comfort of the **intercession of Christ**.

Critically, interlocutors influenced by more pronounced **biblical-theological** paradigms sometimes suggest that Holstrom’s prose risks over-formalizing the **ordo salutis** into discrete steps that can harden into introspection. Others note that the rhetorical weight assigned to **penal substitution** can eclipse the broader victory and recapitulation motifs within classic atonement dogmatics. Holstrom’s own responses reiterate his commitment to keep first things first for the sake of troubled consciences, while affirming that a full-orbed **union with Christ** includes participation in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection, not merely juridical transfer.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and especially **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Holstrom’s project is commendably aligned with **confessional orthodoxy** and the pastoral burden of retrieving the **ordinary means of grace**. His insistence on **Sola Scriptura**, **imputation**, **justification by faith alone**, and a **Van Tilian** account of reason resonates with WTS’s tradition of principled presuppositionalism and confessional fidelity. The main tension is not one of substance but of accent. A WTS critique would urge a more explicit integration of **union with Christ** as the architectonic category that orders the **ordo salutis**, so that justification and sanctification remain distinct yet inseparable gifts within the one bond, and a fuller **Vosian biblical theology** that situates soteriology within the unfolding **historia salutis** without flattening redemptive history. Likewise, care is needed to ensure that rhetoric about **assurance** privileges Christ’s **objective work** while robustly articulating the Spirit’s eschatological down payment in the church’s **sacramental** life. Alternative but compatible accents in classical Reformed orthodoxy would stress the covenantal drama of **promise and fulfillment**, the ecclesial centrality of **preaching and sacraments** as the primary theater of the Spirit’s ministry, and the doxological horizon of **divine simplicity** and **immutability** that anchors all pastoral counsel in God’s unchanging character. Within those parameters, Holstrom’s catechetical clarity functions as a needed corrector of contemporary vagueness, and his work can be deepened by a richer biblical-theological and sacramental texture without losing its evangelical center.
