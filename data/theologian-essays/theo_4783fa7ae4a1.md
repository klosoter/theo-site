### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, city, and school
The figure of **Cyril of Alexandria**, bishop from 412 to 444, emerges from a city where **imperial politics**, **inter-episcopal rivalry**, and **aftershocks of Arianism** shaped the theological stage. His Alexandrian context was marked by the legacy of **Athanasius** on the **Nicene confession** of the Son’s *homoousios* with the Father, a deep confidence in **allegorical exegesis** as a ladder to Christological truth, and an institutional rivalry with **Constantinople** and the **Antiochene school**. His governance included clashes with **Orestes** the prefect, the tragic turmoil around **Hypatia**, and policies that sought consolidation of ecclesial authority, which framed his later leadership during the **Nestorian crisis**. As a churchman of the **Alexandrian school**, Cyril fused **scriptural catenae**, **conciliar canons**, and the earlier soteriology of **Athanasius** into a coherent project whose aim was the defense of the **unity of Christ** for the sake of the **salvation of the world**.

Cyril’s method combined **biblical exegesis**, **patristic appeal**, and **dogmatic reasoning** ordered by the rule of faith. He read the Gospels through **Alexandrian figural interpretation**, especially **Luke** and **John**, yet insisted that exegesis be governed by the **identity of Christ** confessed at **Nicaea**. The key to his epistemic stance is the soteriological axiom that only the one who is truly **God** can save, hence only if the very **Word of God** is the acting subject of Jesus can the **cross** and **resurrection** be salvific. The Alexandrian practice is not free speculation, but a disciplined reading in the **ecclesial canon**, where the analysis of terms like *hypostasis*, *physis*, and *prosopon* must secure the **one concrete subject** of the Incarnation, the **divine Word**.

#### 2. Method and rule of faith
The hallmark of **Cyril’s method** is the harnessing of **Scripture’s soteriological plot** to shape technical **Christological grammar**. He appeals incessantly to **Nicene authority**, reads **Athanasius** as a guide to both **Trinity** and **Incarnation**, and marshals a chorus of **fathers** as a rule of interpretation. His **allegorical exegesis** does not negate the historical narrative, but uncovers its ontological subject, the **one Lord Jesus Christ**, true **God** and true **man**. Cyril insists on the biblical **Theotokos**, Mary as God-bearer, because the identity of the child determines the identity of the passion and the efficacy of the **atonement**. He therefore links **terminology** to **soteriology**: impious word-choices about Christ dismember the **Gospel**. It is in this vein that he articulates the **communicatio idiomatum**, the communication of idioms, not as a mere verbal trope, but as an index of the **hypostatic union** where the one subject, the **Word**, truly assumes human attributes and experiences suffering in the flesh.

This method is unified by the conviction that **confession regulates predication**. The church confesses **one Son**, thus the predicates of divinity and humanity belong to the **same who**, not to two parallel persons or a moral conjunction. The much-debated formula **μία φύσις τοῦ Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη**, one incarnate nature of God the Word, was Cyril’s way of safeguarding a single concrete subject, the **Word** in and through whom human nature is assumed. For Cyril, *physis* here signifies concrete existent nature as hypostatic reality, not a mere abstract essence. This is not a denial of the **two natural sets of properties**, but a denial that there are two sons or two subjects, which would fracture the **Gospel**.

#### 3. The Nestorian crisis and Ephesus
The proximate catalyst of **Cyril’s doctrinal synthesis** was the preaching of **Nestorius**, enthroned in **Constantinople** in 428, who hesitated to call Mary **Theotokos** and preferred **Christotokos**, arguing for an association of the man Jesus with the divine Word. Cyril responded with **Letters to Nestorius** in 429 and 430, culminating in the **Third Letter** and the **Twelve Anathemas** in 430, where he targeted the **prosopic union** model associated with **Theodore of Mopsuestia**. The Anathemas assert that if anyone divides the **one Christ** into two sons, disjoins the **union** into mere conjunction, or denies that the **Word** suffered in the flesh, let him be anathema. The rule is not rhetorical excess but the grammar of a **saving union**.

At the **Council of Ephesus** in 431, over which **Cyril** presided, Nestorius was condemned and deposed, and the title **Theotokos** was affirmed. The council ratified Cyril’s **letters** as normatively orthodox documents, thus canonizing his **hypostatic union** language. The process was fraught with imperial suspicions and Antiochene dissent. **John of Antioch** arrived late, held a counter-synod, and denounced Cyril. Yet through imperial negotiation and continuing correspondence, a formula of rapprochement emerged that shows the elasticity and precision of Cyril’s project under pressure.

#### 4. The Formula of Reunion and the scope of unity
In 433 the **Formula of Reunion** reconciled **Cyril** and **John of Antioch**, acknowledging a confession of **two natures**, divine and human, united without **confusion**, **change**, **division**, or **separation**. Cyril accepted the language of two natures as long as the **one subject** remained decisive. This acceptance reveals the deep continuity between Cyril’s **μία φύσις** formula and later **Chalcedonian** grammar, for he did not wish to absorb or confound the human, but to assert the non-competitive union of **natural properties** in the **one hypostasis** of the **Word**. His **Scholia on the Incarnation**, from 431 to 433, clarify that the **Word** assumed a complete human nature, a rational soul and body, thereby repudiating **Apollinarianism** while maintaining the personal unity.

The decisive doctrinal task is to move from negations to the positive confession of a **communicating subject**. Cyril insists that **divine operations** and **human experiences** are predicated of one and the same **Lord**. Hence he defends the sense in which God suffered, namely the **Word suffered in the flesh**. This is the heart of the **communicatio idiomatum**. It grounds the liturgical proclamation, the **Eucharistic epiclesis**, and the spiritual life of the faithful. The **one who** saves is the one who is worshiped, and thus the worship of Jesus without reservation witnesses to the **hypostatic union**.

#### 5. Major works and doctrinal elaboration
Cyril’s corpus supplies the scaffolding for this doctrinal edifice. The **Third Letter to Nestorius** and the **Twelve Anathemas** form the conciliar spine, but later expository works cultivated constructive clarity. **On the Unity of Christ**, compiled from the mid-430s to his death in 444, is a dialogical defense of the **single-subject Christology**, arguing that predicates belong to the one **person** of the **Word** and that the **human nature** has no independent personhood apart from its union with the **Word**. This anticipates later technical terms such as *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia*, the human nature of Christ having no separate hypostasis yet being truly personal in the hypostasis of the **Logos**.

In the **Commentary on John**, finished roughly between 428 and 441, Cyril reads the Fourth Gospel as a revelation of **divine identity** through **economic descent** and **saving ascent**. The prologue shows the eternal **Word**, *homoousios* with the Father, assuming flesh in order to make the Father known. The signs of the Gospel display the **unity of acting subject**, the same one who raises Lazarus is the one who will lay down his life. In **Against Julian**, written in the later 430s, Cyril defends the **Old Testament’s** divine inspiration and its Christological fulfillment against pagan critique, underscoring the unity of **covenant** and the **Word’s economy**. His **Glaphyra on the Pentateuch** reads the law through Christ, displaying typical Alexandrian **figural typology** in service of **doctrine**.

#### 6. Antiochene interlocutors and posthumous reception
The sharpest exchanges occurred with **Theodoret of Cyrus**, who attacked the **Twelve Anathemas** and defended a stricter **two-nature** language. Cyril answered by clarifying that acknowledgment of **distinction of natures** is bound to affirmation of **one subject**. He rejected any **prosopic union**, a merely moral or conjunctive relation, and he maintained that **will** and **energy** belong to Christ according to both natures without a split subject. The delicate issue of double predication and single subject is already present, anticipating the later **dyothelite** settlement that will guard **two wills**, divine and human, in the **one Christ**.

Cyril died in 444, but his Christology set the terms for **Chalcedon** in 451 and for later disputes. The **Definition of Chalcedon** reads as a translation and measure of **Cyrilline Christology**, held together with the **Tome of Leo**. It affirms one and the same Son, **perfect in divinity and humanity**, consubstantial with the Father and with us, in two natures without **confusion** or **division**. Non-Chalcedonian traditions claimed Cyril as their doctor of **miaphysis**, while Chalcedonians insisted that his **Formula of Reunion** and the **two natures** language locate his ecclesial intention. The best reading sees **Cyril** as the architect of **single-subject Christology**, whose formulae admit a Chalcedonian interpretation when the semantic range of *physis* is kept in view.

#### 7. The Theotokos, soteriology, and theosis
For **Cyril**, the **Theotokos** title is not an honorific for Mary but a cipher for **Christological identity**. If the one born of Mary is the **Word** made flesh, then the predicates of human vulnerability belong to the **Lord of glory** by virtue of the **hypostatic union**. This secures the **soteriological principle** that the cross is the act of **God** in the flesh, not of a separate human person. Cyril’s soteriology is not a forensic scheme alone, though he speaks of **expiation** and **victory**. It is fundamentally **participatory**, the **exchange formula** by which the **Word** became what we are, that we might become what he is, a logic of **theosis** grounded in the **Incarnation** and enacted through the **Spirit**. The **Spirit’s** role for Cyril is to unite believers to the **incarnate Word**, making the **saving properties** of Christ effective in the faithful.

This participatory vision is sacramentally focused. In the **Commentary on John**, especially on John 6, Cyril teaches a robust **Eucharistic realism**. The bread and wine, through the **epiclesis** and the promise, are truly the **life-giving body and blood** of the **Word**, whose flesh gives life because it is the flesh of **God**. The communicant receives not bare sign but **vivifying communion**, which advances **theosis** by participation in the humanity of the **Word**, inseparable from his divinity. The logic remains **christocentric** and **pneumatological**. The **Spirit** unites to the **Word**, and the **Word’s** flesh is the instrument of life. This sacramental thread binds Cyril’s **soteriology** to his **Christology** without collapsing creature into Creator, and yet it presses as far as possible the claim that salvation is communion with **God** through the **incarnate Son**.

#### 8. Trinity and the economy of revelation
Although renowned for **Christology**, **Cyril** also stands in the Athanasian line on **Trinitarian doctrine**. He confesses one **ousia**, three **hypostaseis**, the **Father**, **Son**, and **Holy Spirit**, with a strong sense of **inseparable operations** in the economy. The **Spirit** proceeds from the **Father** and is sent through the **Son**, a through-Son relation that later debates would parse with respect to the **filioque**. For Cyril, the **Spirit’s** procession and mission secure the believer’s union with the **Son**, and through the **Son** with the **Father**. The **Trinity** is not an isolated locus but the deep grammar of **Incarnation** and **salvation**. The **Word’s** assumption of flesh is the work of the **Trinity**, and the **Spirit** is the bond that brings the **benefits of Christ** to the church.

His **biblical theology** reiterates the unity of the **Old** and **New Testaments**, the one **Word** active in both. In **Against Julian** he defends the **Mosaic law** and the **prophets** as forward-driving witnesses to Christ, undercutting pagan critiques by a robust vision of **providence** and **history**. In **Glaphyra**, his **typology** renders the **Passover**, the **manna**, and the **temple** as anticipations of **Christ’s body** and the **Eucharist**. The **church** is thus the locus where Scripture, **sacrament**, and **dogma** converge, as the **single-subject Christology** anchors revelation’s unity and the believer’s **participation** in divine life.

#### 9. Integrated assessment and legacy
The abiding contribution of **Cyril of Alexandria** is a fully integrated **single-subject Christology** that binds **soteriology**, **sacrament**, and **Trinity** into one doctrinal act. He secures the **identity of Jesus** as the **Word** in person, guarantees the **efficacy of the cross**, and directs all predication to the **one Lord**. His language of **μία φύσις τοῦ Θεοῦ Λόγου σεσαρκωμένη** must be read in harmony with his acceptance of **two natures** in the **Formula of Reunion**, lest later categories be imposed anachronistically. The center of gravity is clear. No division of sons, no reduction to moral conjunction, no eclipse of the human. The **Word** assumes and heals, the **Spirit** unites, the **church** confesses, and the **Eucharist** nourishes.

From a **Reformed and WTS evaluation**, the strengths are commanding. The **hypostatic union** as single subject, the **Theotokos** as doctrinal safeguard, and the careful **communicatio idiomatum** are foundational to **Reformed Christology** as codified in **Chalcedonian orthodoxy** and echoed in classic confessions. The Reformed can also affirm Cyril’s anti-Nestorian **soteriological principle**, that God himself acts in the flesh for our salvation, and can appropriate his use of **patristic consensus** as an interpretive rule under **Scripture’s** primacy. Yet cautions arise. His **allegorical exegesis** must be disciplined by grammatical-historical reading within the **covenantal** structure of redemptive history. His strong **Eucharistic realism** presses beyond the **spiritual presence** affirmed by the Reformed, who secure **real participation** by the **Spirit** without localizing Christ’s body. The language of **theosis** can be welcomed when read as **union with Christ** by the **Spirit** and participation in **communicated benefits**, rather than an ontological elevation. Finally, Cyril’s **μία φύσις** formula is best received through **Chalcedon’s** two-natures clarity, with **anhypostasia** and **enhypostasia** serving as technical clarifiers that preserve his single subject while protecting the integrity of Christ’s **human nature**. In sum, the **Reformed** embrace the **Cyrilline core** yet translate it through a **covenantal, pneumatic, and confessional** grammar that resists both **Nestorian disjunction** and **Eutychian confusion**.
