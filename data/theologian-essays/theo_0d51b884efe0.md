### ESSAY
Jonathan D. Trigg emerges in late twentieth-century debates as a lucid reader of **Luther’s** sacramental voice, committed to showing how **baptism** functions as the concrete event of **promissio** that grounds **justification**, **assurance**, and Christian vocation. His signature monograph, **Baptism in the Theology of Martin Luther** published in 1994, stands as a programmatic retrieval of the reformer’s early and mature writings on the sacraments. Trigg writes from within an Anglophone context shaped by **Heiko Oberman’s** insistence on Luther’s medieval embeddedness, by the post–Vatican II ecumenical re-opening of **Tridentine** issues, and by the analytic clarity of scholars such as **Alister E. McGrath** on **iustitia extra nos**. The core of Trigg’s contribution is neither a novel constructive system nor a polemical manifesto, but a disciplined, historical-theological clarification of **Luther’s** sacramental realism, accessed through the conceptual triad of **verbum**, **promissio**, and **fides**.

#### 1.
Trigg’s method is overtly historical and textual, yet oriented by dogmatic questions. He practices a hermeneutic of **promissio** that reads **Luther’s** reform of sacramental language as a re-centering of the gospel’s address to the sinner. This approach foregrounds **law and gospel** as interpretive poles, treats the sacraments as **verbum visibile** rather than quasi-magical rites, and tracks **Luther’s** shifting vocabulary across genre and decade. Trigg carefully situates **Luther** among **Augustine**, **Hugh of St. Victor**, and the **Lombard**, where the **sacramentum-res** distinction helped maintain the integrity of signs without collapsing them into mere signs. He presses beyond older binaries of either **ex opere operato** efficacy or subjective memorialism by recovering **Luther’s** claim that God binds himself to signs through the **Word**, and thus that sacramental efficacy is the objectivity of the divine **promise** enacted and received by **faith**. In this frame, **Scholastic** categories are not discarded but soteriologically reconfigured, and **philological** attention serves doctrinal clarity.

Trigg’s 1994 study unfolds as a developmental reading of **Luther’s** baptismal theology across key documents. He follows the trajectory from the **Sermon on the Blessed Sacrament of the Holy and True Body of Christ** in 1519 and the **Babylonian Captivity of the Church** in 1520, through the polemics **Against the Heavenly Prophets** in 1525 and **Concerning Rebaptism** in 1528, to the **Large Catechism** and **Small Catechism** in 1529. The thesis is crisp: for **Luther**, baptism is not an occasional ordinance appended to **justification**; it is the concrete form of the gospel’s **promissio** as it seizes the sinner, slays the old Adam, and raises the new through **mortificatio et vivificatio**. Trigg stresses that Luther’s hallmark cry, I am baptized, functions as external **certitudo** under **Anfechtung** because the sacrament is God’s pledge not ours. This renders **assurance** an aspect of the divine act, not an introspective achievement, while binding the believer’s ongoing life to baptism’s once-for-all yet daily appropriated drama.

A central Triggean motif is the inseparability of **Word** and **element**, captured by the classic **verbum visibile** axiom. He reads **Luther** to insist that water does not justify nor does naked faith justify; rather, God justifies by his **promissio** attached to water and received through **fides passiva**, passive faith awakened by the **Spirit** through the **Word**. In this way Trigg both blocks **ex opere operato** and resists a psychological reduction of faith to interior states. Baptism remains a means of grace because the **verbum** is constitutive of the rite, and faith is instrumental because it is receptive to the divine **promissio**. On infant baptism, Trigg highlights **Luther’s** flexible use of **fides infantium** and **fides aliena** without turning either into a precondition. The child is not justified by sponsors but by God’s **promise** that, through the church’s **prayer** and ongoing catechesis, lays claim to the person and brings forth faith in God’s time.

#### 2.
The historical background matters for Trigg’s reading of **Luther**. He tracks how late medieval sacramental theology, especially **Aquinas’s** careful distinction between the instrumentality of signs and the primacy of divine causality, both constrains and provokes **Luther’s** moves. He notes how **Donatist** concerns reappear in Reformation polemics, where the validity of baptism is secured by Christ’s **institution** rather than ministerial worthiness. He also reads Reformation debates with the **Anabaptists** as a test-case in sacramental objectivity. For Trigg, **Luther’s** rejection of rebaptism stems from the sufficiency of the once-given **promissio**, even if later appropriation goes awry, for the problem is unbelief not sacramental defect. By engaging **Trent** in the background, Trigg shows that while **Luther** rejects grace as a habit infused by the rite, he does not thereby deny sacramental efficacy. Rather, he replaces a metaphysic of infused quality with the performative force of **promissio**, an account later echoed in **Oswald Bayer’s** speech-act approach.

In the 1994 monograph, Trigg devotes sustained attention to the **catechisms**. He argues that the **Large Catechism** provides the most systematic account of baptism’s identity and use, where the threefold logic of divine **name**, daily **repentance**, and attached **promise** shapes Christian life. Here **mortificatio et vivificatio** functions as the daily exercise of baptism, such that the baptized lives under the sign of **cross** and **resurrection** as their basic ethic. Trigg notes that this integrates **sanctification** into baptism’s logic without compromising **sola fide**. The good works that follow are not conditions of baptism’s efficacy but the creaturely shape of the **Spirit’s** vivificatio. The **Small Catechism’s** simple Q and A becomes, in Trigg’s hands, evidence of Luther’s pedagogical strategy to let the **promissio** govern all Christian instruction.

Trigg’s analysis of **assurance** is equally careful. He reads Luther’s I am baptized as the paradigmatic external **witness** that interrupts cycles of introspective despair. Under **Anfechtung**, the believer is directed away from self-scrutiny to the **Word** bound to water, so that **justification** rests on the alien righteousness of Christ rather than on a perceived state of grace. Trigg here engages modern debates represented by **McGrath** on **forensic righteousness** and by **Mannermaa** on **union with Christ**. He judges that **Luther** holds both: **forensic** acquittal and real participation, but the order is governed by **promissio**. The presence of Christ is not a metaphysical transformation of the soul but the eschatological nearness of Christ who promises to be for you in the sacramental sign. Trigg thus resists exclusive readings that would make **unio cum Christo** displace the juridical or render **imputation** a bare legal fiction.

A hallmark of Trigg’s exposition is his refusal to let sacramental theology become a silo. He threads **ecclesiology**, **catechesis**, and **discipline** through the baptismal argument. Baptism grants a public name in the **triune** God and incorporates into a community that renounces the **devil**, confesses the **creed**, and prays the **Lord’s Prayer**. This communal frame means baptism is not a private transaction but the church’s identity-forming liturgy. Trigg highlights **Luther’s** insistence that the baptized return to the font daily by remembering the **creed** and practicing **repentance**, thereby tying liturgy to **ethics**. The vocation of the baptized is cruciform, entailing patience, neighbor-love, and confession in a world still under the **law**. The sacrament functions as an eschatological **seal** amid history’s ambiguity, embedding sanctification in the promise rather than in a ladder of merit.

Beyond the 1994 book, Trigg’s essays consolidate his profile as a reader who advances clarity over partisanship. He revisits **infant baptism** debates to show that **Luther** deploys multiple rationales, all ordered by divine **agency** through the **Word** and the church’s **prayer**. He engages the **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification** of 1999 as an ecumenical scene where baptismal language can illuminate otherwise intractable disputes about **grace**, **faith**, and **renewal**. He probes **assurance** not as a psychology but as a participation in the church’s sacramental memory, aligning with **Bayer’s** emphasis on performative promise while keeping close to **catechetical** sources. The cumulative effect is a stable portrait of **Luther’s** sacramental center, resistant to easy syntheses yet unmistakably structured by **promissio**.

Trigg’s interlocutions with the Reformed tradition are careful and charitable. He notes **Calvin’s** description of baptism as **sign and seal**, his insistence that the **Spirit** makes the sacrament effective in due season, and his concern to avoid tying regeneration to the time of the rite. Trigg recognizes a broad consonance on **sola fide** and **Word-Spirit** primacy, while identifying divergences regarding sacramental **objectivity** and the sign-thing relation. He contrasts **Zwingli’s** more memorial emphasis with **Calvin’s** richer sacramental realism, and he reads **Luther** as still pressing further on the concreteness of **promissio** bound to an instituted sign. For Trigg, the stakes are pastoral: assurance that rests on a divine pledge externally given will better withstand **Anfechtung** than assurance built on the vagaries of inward inference.

If there is a signature conceptual contribution, it is Trigg’s disciplined insistence that **baptism** is justification’s form as enacted **promissio**. That claim avoids two errors. It avoids collapsing justification into an interior change by safeguarding **alien righteousness** that comes from outside. It also avoids treating baptism as an optional symbol by showing how the **verbum** attached to an element is the grammar in which the gospel ordinarily reaches its object. This patently **Lutheran** move is historically accountable and theologically generative. It also offers a hermeneutic for reading other loci. **Ecclesiology** becomes the community gathered around instituted **promises**. **Sanctification** becomes the daily enactment of baptismal dying and rising. **Assurance** becomes liturgically grounded. **Mission** becomes the extension of the **name** given in baptism among the nations.

In a Reformed and Westminster Seminary evaluation, several convergences and tensions emerge. There is rich agreement on **sola Scriptura**, **sola fide**, **monergistic grace**, and the **Word-Spirit** primacy that rules out any magical **ex opere operato**. Trigg’s reading of **promissio** as constitutive of the sacrament aligns with **Calvin’s** conviction that the **Word** gives the sign its meaning and efficacy. Yet the Reformed tradition, shaped by **covenant** theology and the **Westminster Standards** on sacraments, would urge sharper distinctions at key junctures. First, the relation of **sign and thing signified** must preserve the freedom of the **Spirit** to apply Christ in his time and mode, so that baptism does not risk being heard as normatively regenerating in or with the rite. Second, the instrumentality of **faith alone** must not be obscured by appeals to **fides infantium** or to communal **fides aliena**, lest assurance be tied to an ecclesial act rather than to Christ received by faith. Third, the Reformed will prefer to ground **assurance** covenantally, with the sacraments as confirmatory **seals** that strengthen faith but do not constitute its being. Within classical Reformed orthodoxy, alternatives such as **Calvin’s** sign-seal grammar and the **Westminster Confession** on baptism’s efficacy to the elect provide a way to incorporate Trigg’s pastoral insight about external **promissio** while more firmly subordinating sacramental efficacy to the **Spirit’s** sovereign application through the **Word** in the ordo salutis.
