### ESSAY
I. Howard Marshall, born 1934 and deceased 2015, emerged as a leading voice in **British evangelical New Testament scholarship**, shaping two generations through his long tenure at the **University of Aberdeen** and his service to the **Tyndale Fellowship**. Formed in the aftermath of **postwar critical debates**, Marshall pursued a mediating posture between continental **historical criticism** and confessional **evangelical theology**, a posture he framed as a critical-realist commitment to the historical referentiality of the **gospel** and the theological unity of the **New Testament**. Against the persistently anti-historical strategies of **Bultmannian** existentialism and the schematic **salvation-history** reconstructions of **Conzelmann**, he argued that historically disciplined exegesis and ecclesially confessed theology are mutually implicative. His early training in Greek and exegesis led him to a methodological blend of **grammatical-historical analysis**, cautious **redaction criticism**, and sustained attention to **canonical coherence**, culminating decades later in his programmatic **New Testament Theology: Many Witnesses, One Gospel** in 2004. Throughout, Marshall insisted that evangelical commitment to **Scripture’s authority** must be tested in the crucible of close textual work rather than safeguarded by insulating dogma.

#### 1. Luke-Acts as theology of history, Spirit, and mission
Marshall’s first major foray into Lukan studies, **Luke: Historian and Theologian**, 1970, set the tone for his career by rejecting the stark dichotomy between **history** and **theology** in **Luke-Acts**. He engaged **Hans Conzelmann’s** thesis that Luke neutralized eschatology into a middle period of **salvation history**, arguing instead for an inaugurated **eschatology** that preserved imminence while highlighting divine patience and **mission**. The argument matured in his **NIGTC** commentary **The Gospel of Luke** in 1978, where the narrative shape of the gospel is read as a coherent **heilsgeschichte** that binds the ministry of **Jesus**, the activity of the **Spirit**, and the formation of a **missional church**. He defended Lukan reliability in names, places, and sequence without reducing the evangelist to a stenographer, arguing that Luke is both a competent ancient historian and a pastor-theologian whose redaction serves the **kerygma**. The hallmark themes of **forgiveness**, **discipleship**, and the **Holy Spirit** appear as theologically structured history rather than as dogmatic overlay.

From Luke to Acts, Marshall’s reading emphasized the continuity of **resurrection** and **Pentecost** as the engine of **witness to the nations**. In his **TNTC Acts** commentary, 1980, he pressed against attempts to domesticate Acts into mere church order, highlighting instead its theological architecture around **promise and fulfillment**, **Spirit empowerment**, and the **Word of God** conquering geographical and cultural barriers. The Lukan program in his hands offered evangelical theology an integrated vision of **Christology**, **pneumatology**, and **ecclesiology**, in which the church is the Spirit-driven community that actualizes the **mission of God** in history.

#### 2. Historical Jesus and the plausibility of the gospel
Marshall confronted the skeptical atmosphere of the **historical Jesus** debate in **I Believe in the Historical Jesus**, 1977, rejecting both naive harmonization and radical reduction. He defended the historical credibility of the **resurrection** and **miracles**, critiqued the overreach of **form criticism**, and re-situated criteria of authenticity within a broader **historical realism**. While appreciating the heuristic role of tradition history and **redaction criticism**, he insisted the canonical **Gospels** are our primary access to Jesus as proclaimed **Lord**. Marshall’s method strove to make a public case for the plausibility of the **gospel** without surrendering its confessional claims, integrating apologetic aims with the **kerygmatic** content of the texts. His work thus became a model of evangelical engagement that refuses both fideism and the secular enclosure of historical method.

#### 3. Johannine ethics of truth and love
In **The Epistles of John, NICNT**, 1978, Marshall combined lexical precision with theological synthesis to illuminate **Christological confession** and **moral transformation** in the Johannine communities. He read the tests of truth, righteousness, and love as mutually interpreting marks of authentic **fellowship** with God. The letters oppose incipient **docetism** or secessionist **heresy** by equating denial of the **incarnation** with ethical failure in love of the brethren. Marshall’s catechetical clarity on **assurance** is striking: assurance is grounded in the **atoning advocacy** of **Jesus Christ** and authenticated in Spirit-enabled obedience. Here he connected Johannine pastoral strategy to a broader New Testament pattern in which **faith and obedience** are distinguishable yet inseparable, a theme that would become crucial in his soteriological reflections on **perseverance** and **final judgment**.

#### 4. Perseverance, assurance, and the shape of salvation
Marshall’s early monograph **Kept by the Power of God**, 1969, canvassed the warning and assurance texts from the **Synoptics**, **Paul**, **Hebrews**, and **John**, arguing that the New Testament depicts salvation as a dynamic covenantal relationship sustained by divine power yet requiring persevering **faith**. He rejected simplistic **once saved, always saved** slogans, concluding that apostasy texts address real possibilities rather than hypothetical alarms. Nevertheless, he resisted Pelagian readings by stressing the primacy of **grace**, the enabling agency of the **Spirit**, and the ecclesial means of grace in sustaining believers. Marshall defined **assurance** as assurance of God’s faithfulness anchored in the **promises of the gospel**, not as presumption about one’s future irrespective of moral response. His later **Aspects of the Atonement**, 2007, complemented this by affirming a multi-dimensional **atonement** with a robust **penal substitution** at the center, set within **Christus Victor** and participatory motifs, thereby connecting objective reconciliation with the subjective pattern of cruciform discipleship.

#### 5. Paul, James, and justification according to works
Marshall’s contribution to debates on **justification** is distributed across essays and his integrative **New Testament Theology**, 2004. He sought to hold together the **forensic** language of **justification by faith** with the consistent New Testament teaching of a **final judgment according to works**. Engaging **E. P. Sanders**, **James D. G. Dunn**, and **N. T. Wright** on the **New Perspective**, he welcomed corrections to caricatures of Second Temple **Judaism** as works-righteousness while maintaining that **Paul** opposed any soteriological boasting and that **faith** is receptive trust in Christ rather than shorthand for covenantal badge. He read **James** as addressing dead orthodoxy rather than opposing Paul, arguing that living faith is intrinsically **operative in love**. The upshot is a soteriology that refuses antinomian distortions of **sola fide** without collapsing justification into moral transformation. For Marshall, the **Spirit** unites believers to Christ, and this union manifests in obedience that will be acknowledged at the **last day**, an approach he believed was already resident in **Paul’s** own rhetoric of sowing and reaping.

#### 6. Ecclesiology, order, and sacrament
Marshall’s exegesis fed a concrete **ecclesiology** shaped by **mission**, **teaching**, and **sacrament**. His **Acts** work underscored patterns of **Word and Spirit**, collegial leadership, and outward-facing witness, anticipating later mission studies that prize narrative theology. In **The Last Supper and the Lord’s Supper**, 1980, he argued for a robustly evangelical understanding of the **Eucharist** as proclamation and participation. He rejected **transubstantiation** and memorialism alike, offering a **Spirit-mediated presence** in which the risen **Christ** nourishes faith through the signs. He also devoted major attention to church order in **The Pastoral Epistles, ICC**, 1999, produced with the assistance of **Philip Towner**. Marshall treated authorship with measured conservatism, allowing the plausibility of Pauline authorship through an amanuensis within the complexities of early Christian letter production, though he also left room for composition by a close associate soon after **Paul’s** death. More decisively, he argued that the Pastorals present **sound teaching** that issues in **godliness**, where leadership is assessed in terms of character, teaching competence, and missional integrity. This constructive retrieval countered the tendency to read the Pastorals as late and merely institutional.

#### 7. Scripture, method, and evangelical confidence
Marshall’s views on **Scripture** and hermeneutics found programmatic expression in **Biblical Inspiration**, 1982, and in his edited volume **New Testament Interpretation**, 1977. He affirmed the **infallibility** of Scripture in accomplishing its divine purpose and the trustworthiness of the texts in their historical claim-making, while cautiously declining to align with American-style **inerrancy** formulations that flatten genre and ancient conventions. His editorial leadership recruited voices to clarify **historical-grammatical** method, the legitimate possibilities and limits of **redaction criticism**, and the theological claims embedded in narrative forms. As co-editor of the **Dictionary of Jesus and the Gospels**, 1992, with **Joel Green** and **Scot McKnight**, he curated essays that model the integration of critical scholarship with confessional stakes. The throughline in these projects is an evangelical confidence that Scripture’s **truth** is best displayed by sustained engagement with the text’s literary shape, ancient context, and theological intent.

#### 8. Pedagogy, collaboration, and the shape of New Testament theology
The integrative impulse culminated in **New Testament Theology: Many Witnesses, One Gospel**, 2004, where Marshall sought to respect the distinctive voices of **Matthew**, **Luke-Acts**, **Paul**, **John**, and others while articulating their shared **gospel** center. The controlling metaphor is many witnesses converging on one **euangelion**: God’s saving action in the life, death, and resurrection of **Jesus Christ**, effected and applied by the **Spirit**, generating communities of **faithful obedience**. The book’s structure avoids imposing a systematic **ordo salutis** from without, instead allowing textual patterns to yield categories like **kingdom**, **new covenant**, and **Spirit-empowered mission**. Alongside this magnum opus, his co-authored **Exploring the New Testament** volumes with **Stephen Travis** and **Ian Paul** disseminated these gains pedagogically, modeling an evangelical scholarship that is hospitable, textually rigorous, and alert to theological stakes. Marshall’s career thus functioned as a bridge between church and academy, and between exegesis and **systematic theology**.

Marshall’s steady public presence included editorial work with **Evangelical Quarterly**, leadership in the **British New Testament Society**, and mentorship of scholars such as **Joel Green** and **Philip Towner**, who extended his emphases on **narrative theology**, **mission**, and the **Pastorals**. He remained a churchman, attentive to preaching, catechesis, and global **mission**, embodying the conviction that New Testament scholarship serves the **edification** of the people of God. His death in 2015 marked the close of a remarkably productive vocation, but his corpus continues to guide evangelical reflection on **Luke-Acts**, **soteriology**, and **biblical authority**.

In assessment from a Reformed and Westminster Seminary perspective, Marshall offers substantial gifts alongside real tensions. Positively, his exegesis of **Luke-Acts** deepens Reformed emphases on **Word and Spirit**, **mission**, and the **kingdom** as the eschatological horizon of **covenant** promise. His defense of the historical **resurrection** and the unity of **New Testament theology** fortifies **sola Scriptura** and keeps doctrinal formulation tethered to exegesis. His account of the **Lord’s Supper** aligns with a robust **spiritual presence**, consonant with **Calvin’s** sacramental theology. Yet his **conditional perseverance** and stress on the real possibility of apostasy sit awkwardly with classic **perseverance of the saints**, **effectual calling**, and **definite atonement** within a monergistic **covenant of grace**. His articulation of **final judgment according to works** is biblically necessary, but requires careful calibration to protect **sola fide** and the imputation of Christ’s **righteousness**, lest evidential works language drift into a second-stage justificatory logic. Finally, his preference for **infallibility** language over stronger **inerrancy** formulations may undercut the confessional clarity prized in **Warfieldian** trajectories, though his genre-sensitive trust in Scripture’s truthfulness can be harmonized with a Reformed doctrine of Scripture when thickly stated. The best Reformed appropriation receives Marshall’s exegetical rigor, missionary **ecclesiology**, and multi-dimensional **atonement** while answering his soteriological cautions by reaffirming the triune initiative in **salvation**, the preserving **grace** of God in the **covenant of redemption**, and the instrumental character of works as Spirit-wrought fruit rather than co-causes of final acceptance.
