### ESSAY
William P. Alston, 1921 to 2009, stands at the crossroads of **analytic epistemology**, **philosophy of language**, and **philosophical theology**, forging a distinct path through the debris of mid-century **logical positivism** and toward a renewed **realism** about religious knowledge. Trained in the analytic tradition and teaching at institutions such as Michigan, Rutgers, Illinois, and Syracuse, he helped pivot American philosophy of religion from defensive apologetic postures toward constructive accounts of **knowledge of God**. The organizational marker of this turn was his leadership in the **Society of Christian Philosophers** and the journal **Faith and Philosophy**, but the intellectual core was his insistence that the same categories that make **sense perception** rationally authoritative can, mutatis mutandis, make **religious experience** rationally authoritative. In place of thin verificationism, Alston placed **doxastic practices** near the center of epistemic life; in place of irenic irrealism, he defended **a realist conception of truth**; and in place of purely inferential theism, he argued for the **perceptual model** of experiencing God.

Alston’s method is anchored in **externalist reliabilism** refined through the social and historical embeddedness of **belief-forming practices**. Against the legacy of **Roderick Chisholm’s** internalist foundationalism and **Laurence BonJour’s** coherentism, he argued in essays later collected in **Epistemic Justification** 1989 that justification cannot be primarily deontological. The attempt to equate epistemic excellence with fulfilling duties of careful belief management fails because epistemic access to our own compliance is limited and because deontological categories mislocate the normativity of belief. Instead, Alston locates justification in participation in reliable **doxastic practices** such as sense perception, memory, introspection, and basic rational intuition. This is an externalist turn, but it is not blind reliabilism; the social practice frame structures the permissive but defeasible status of beliefs, and the evaluative focus shifts to the **reliability** of the practice rather than to immediate access to reasons. The result is a carefully hedged **permissivism** about rational belief: one may rationally trust a socially established practice in the absence of undefeated defeaters.

The pivotal monograph **Perceiving God** 1991 advances this method into philosophical theology by developing a **perceptual model of mystical experience**. Alston distinguishes between **M-experiences** experiences as of the presence and activity of God and the resultant **M-beliefs** formed within the Christian mystical practice. The argument is parity based. If we treat **sense perception** as a socially sustained, prima facie reliable practice even though we cannot escape a degree of **epistemic circularity** when trying to certify its reliability, then consistency requires that we treat the Christian **mystical doxastic practice** with like generosity, absent strong defeat. Alston specifies **defeater conditions** including internal incoherence, sustained failure under reflection, or pervasive conflict with other undefeated practices. He acknowledges that cross-practice disagreement, for example between Christian and non-Christian mystical traditions, generates a form of **overrider** pressure. His response is not to paper over disagreement but to situate it within a broader permissive externalism that allows continued practice under conditions of rational scrutiny, much as contemporaneous science proceeds despite unresolved underdetermination. The core claim is that there is no principled reason to deny **prima facie justification** to beliefs formed by disciplined attentiveness to God’s presence in prayer and worship.

Alston’s earlier and adjacent work in general epistemology underwrites this move. **The Reliability of Sense Perception** 1993 defends direct realism about perceptual awareness and refines the criteria by which a practice can be deemed reliable. Through detailed attention to **perceptual psychology**, error types, and practice internal checks, he offers a model that transposes into the religious domain in **Perceiving God**. Along the way, he clarifies **epistemic circularity**. Attempts to vindicate an ultimate practice without some appeal to that practice are doomed, but such circularity can be non-vicious because it arises at the level of the **deep basis** of cognition. Sense perception cannot be discursively certified without at some point relying on perception. The same structure holds, Alston argues, for memory, rational intuition, and the mystical practice. This shared predicament of practices licenses a **position of parity** rather than a double standard that insulates the secular while demanding impossible validation from the religious. Here Alston’s interlocutors include **Alvin Goldman** on reliabilism, **Ernest Sosa** on virtue-theoretic refinements, and **Nicholas Wolterstorff** on rationality and religious belief, with whom Alston shares a constructive recovery of **the rationality of Christian belief** outside evidentialist strictures.

Alongside epistemology, Alston produced significant essays in **philosophical theology** on **religious language** and **divine attributes**, gathered in **Divine Nature and Human Language** 1989. Against the claim that theological predications must be either equivocal or merely analogical in a way that deprives them of cognitive content, Alston argues for a measured **literalism** he often calls univocal predication within limits. The key tool is the **determinable-determinate** relation. Predicates like being good or being powerful pick out determinables that admit radically different determinates in God and creatures. The semantic sense is preserved univocally at the level of the determinable, while the metaphysical realization diverges without sliding into sheer equivocation. On this account, talk of **divine goodness** and **divine power** retains conceptual grip while acknowledging the **Creator-creature distinction**. Alston is respectful toward **Aquinas’s analogia entis** but judges the Thomist apparatus of proportionality and attribution insufficiently clear at the level of linguistic practice. His proposal is thus a semantic alternative to analogy that safeguards **cognitive content** while building in metaphysical modesty. This complements his insistence on **alethic realism** that theological claims aim to be true of God as God is.

The book **A Realist Conception of Truth** 1996 crystallizes Alston’s response to the late twentieth century trend toward **antirealism** and **verificationism**. Truth, he argues, is a **correspondence** relation that is mind independent, though our access to it is mediated by fallible practices. He resists both deflationary minimalism and robust inflationary metaphysics that overspecify correspondence. Theologically, this stance underwrites the meaningfulness of doctrinal assertion about **God’s triunity**, **incarnation**, and **providence** by refusing to reduce truth to consensus, coherence, or pragmatic success. The later volume **Illocutionary Acts and Sentence Meaning** 2000, though not a theological treatise, reinforces the point by grounding **meaning** in **speech act** theory. Building on **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, Alston explains how what is said, asserted, promised, or commanded goes beyond mere sentence form. This has downstream importance for **Scripture** and doctrinal discourse, since theological language is replete with illocutionary complexity. Alston’s emphasis on assertoric content within speech acts holds open a robust space for **doctrinal assertion** that is neither purely expressive nor merely performative.

Alston also engaged the metaphysics of **divine attributes**, asking in a widely discussed essay whether **God has beliefs**. He argues that if **omniscience** is maximal epistemic excellence, God does not stand in our doxastic state of believing but knows directly and infallibly. The analysis protects divine perfection by declining to model God’s cognition on human propositional attitudes. In adjacent work he scrutinizes strong **divine simplicity** insofar as it threatens to collapse all distinctions in God into one undifferentiated identity, which could render predication vacuous. While he does not deny the classical motives for simplicity, such as safeguarding **aseity** and **immutability**, he urges precision about what is intended by identity claims across divine attributes. This intersects his determinable strategy for language. We can preserve meaningful talk of **divine knowledge**, **will**, and **power** without entailing creaturely composition in God, if we restrict ourselves to modest claims about how determinable properties are supremely realized in the **ipsum esse** of God. The point is not to resolve classical debates by fiat but to secure predication so that beliefs formed within a **mystical practice** have doctrinal content to which they answer.

Interlocutors across Alston’s career sharpened his positions. With **Alvin Plantinga**, he shares an **externalist** diagnosis of evidentialism’s failure, though Plantinga’s **proper function** and **sensus divinitatis** proposal supplies a teleological design plan that Alston’s **practice** model leaves more open. With **Richard Swinburne**, he contrasts a **perceptual** grounding of theism with inductive confirmation: Swinburne recommends cumulative probabilities, whereas Alston invites us to treat **awareness of God** as fundamentally experiential. Against **Wittgensteinian fideists**, Alston insists on **realist truth** and cognitive content beyond form of life descriptions. Against **non-realist pluralism** as in **John Hick**, he rejects the move to a noumenal Real that dissolves doctrinal content while conceding that practice parity across religions requires careful handling of disagreement and defeat. In epistemology he disputes **BonJour’s** regress arguments for internalism, urging that any escape strategy that trusts memory, perception, or intuition will mirror his own **practice** permissivism. In philosophy of language he revises analytical accounts of **meaning** to better fit actual **illocutionary** usage, with implications for how theology hears the **assertions** of Scripture and tradition.

The cumulative picture is a theologian-philosopher who reconceives how we may rationally come to know the **living God**. The heart is the idea that a human life shaped by liturgy, prayer, and obedience can host **perceptual awareness** of God. That claim is fitted to a framework that declines impossible demands for grounding clarity and refuses to be satisfied with deflationary understandings of truth or language. The web includes **doxastic practices** as the scaffolding of cognition, **epistemic circularity** as an honest concession about deep bases, **prima facie** status as a defeasible rational permission, and **realist truth** as the goal toward which assertions aim. This synthesis allowed Alston to answer the question after positivism: what does it mean to say Jesus is Lord and God is present. It means we are licensed to take our practiced perception with utmost seriousness, to confess truth as correspondence, and to speak of God with conceptual integrity. These claims made Alston a central architect of the late twentieth century revival of **analytic philosophical theology**.

Criticisms of Alston’s project tend to cluster around three pressure points. First, the claim of parity across **doxastic practices** raises the specter of intractable **religious disagreement**. Alston replies with defeater theory and practical rationality, but some worry that this yields an overly permissive pluralism. Second, the **perceptual model** is protested by some who fear it domesticates divine transcendence or confuses **grace** with natural cognitive powers. Alston counters that the model is analogical and content laden, not a simple extension of sense perception. Third, in **religious language**, his determinable strategy is challenged by Thomists who prefer **analogical** predication and by analytic theists who fear a slide toward **theistic personalism** through overly univocal language. Alston’s reply is that his semantic account respects divine transcendence while preserving the possibility of doctrinal truth. These exchanges sharpen the sense that his project is neither fideist nor evidentialist, but a distinctive via media that seeks to do justice to the rational life of faith.

The Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation must begin with gratitude for Alston’s defense of **alethic realism**, his careful **externalist** critique of deontological evidentialism, and his insistence that the Church’s **doxastic practices** can be rational without illicit neutrality. His work allies naturally with a **Reformed epistemology** that invokes the **sensus divinitatis** and the **self-authenticating** authority of **Scripture** as principium cognoscendi. Nevertheless, two tensions appear. First, Alston’s parity strategy risks leveling the covenantal distinction by placing Christian **mystical perception** on the same justificatory plane as rival practices; a Reformed alternative would weight practices by their relation to the **covenant Word**, locating the primary norm in the Spirit’s **illumination** of Scripture rather than in comparably structured experiences. Second, his guarded reservations about strong **divine simplicity** and his preference for a modest univocity in **religious language** can tilt toward **theistic personalism**, whereas classical Reformed orthodoxy affirms simplicity as a metaphysical confession of **aseity** and construes predication under the **analogia fidei** governed by revelation. The constructive path, then, is to appropriate Alston’s **externalist warrant**, **defeater** discipline, and **realist truth** while subordinating the permissive parity of practices to the canonically normed **covenantal practice** of Word and sacrament, and to receive his linguistic clarity as a supplement to, not a substitute for, the church’s confessional grammar of the **simple, triune God**.
