### ESSAY
Brad Gregory is a contemporary **Roman Catholic** historian whose work has pressed theological questions into the center of early modern historiography. Trained as a specialist in **Reformation** and **post-Reformation** Europe and teaching at **Stanford** before moving to **Notre Dame** in 2003, Gregory emerged during the late twentieth-century reassessment of **secularization** that had already complicated the classic **Weberian** and **Tawneyan** narratives. His intellectual formation bears the imprint of **Alasdair MacIntyre’s** account of tradition-constituted rationality and of **Charles Taylor’s** mapping of the modern **immanent frame**, while his own normative orientation is unapologetically **Thomistic**. The result is a historical method that is both genealogical and teleologically alert, arguing that the fracture of Christian moral and metaphysical unity after the sixteenth century generated a durable **hyperpluralism** that secularized the West. Within that analysis his Catholic commitments surface as a constructive wager on **sacramental ontology**, **natural law**, and the adjudicative role of the **magisterium**.

His first major book, **Salvation at Stake** 1999, already combined narrative vigor with conceptual ambition. Examining **martyrdom** among **Anabaptists**, **Lutherans**, **Reformed**, and **Catholics** from the 1520s into the seventeenth century, Gregory contends that the martyrs’ choices were rational within coherent though rival **soteriological** and **ecclesiological** frameworks. Drawing on **MacIntyre**, he resists the flattening of martyrdom into sociological epiphenomena or psychological aberration and insists instead on the integrity of **tradition-shaped practical reason**. The book integrates theological claims central to the Reformation conflicts such as **justification**, **sacramental efficacy**, and **church discipline** into a textured social history, highlighting how **confessionalization** linked doctrine, praxis, and polity. That analysis implies an incipient thesis that contested claims to **truth** do not evaporate under modern scrutiny but rather harden into intractable differences absent an authoritative adjudicator.

The normative edge emerges in full in **The Unintended Reformation** 2012. Gregory’s core claim is that the sixteenth-century religious revolution unleashed processes that secularized society not by design but by cumulative consequence. The book unfolds across six domains that double as chapter themes: **Relativizing Doctrines**, **Controlling the Churches**, **Subjectivizing Morality**, **Manufacturing the Goods**, **Secularizing Knowledge**, and **Excluding God**. At each point he ties theological fracture to sociopolitical transformations, arguing that the rejection of a unified **sacramental metaphysics** and of a common **natural law** moral grammar produced a Western **hyperpluralism** in which rival comprehensive claims cannot be rationally arbitrated. While the analysis is historical, its evaluative thrust points toward the necessity of a recovered **Thomistic metaphysics** and the institutional authority of the **Catholic magisterium** if truth, moral order, and intellectual integration are to be sustained.

A critical background feature in Gregory’s story is the late medieval turn to **nominalism** and **voluntarism**. Following **Heiko Oberman**, he reads the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as marked by a weakening of **metaphysical realism** and an accent on divine will that eroded confidence in **analogia entis** and in the participatory grammar of **sacramental realism**. This intellectual shift generated pastoral distortions such as the abuse of **indulgences**, set the stage for reformist crisis, and made the **Protestant** appeal to **sola scriptura** more plausible as a corrective. Yet, for Gregory, the Protestant cure proved worse than the disease. The principle of **Scripture alone** coupled with the denial of a living **magisterium** fostered the fragmentation of doctrinal adjudication, while the harnessing of confessions to princes accelerated the politicization of **church authority** within emergent state structures. The net effect was not principled liberty but institutional competition and entrenched conflict.

Gregory’s chapter on **Secularizing Knowledge** offers a genealogy of the modern university. He contends that medieval **sacra doctrina** had oriented the disciplines within a hierarchically ordered vision whose apex was **theology**, understood as scientia about God and all things in relation to God. With post-Reformation conflict, and through battles over **confessional universities**, knowledge became compartmentalized. By the nineteenth century, the **Humboldtian research ideal** and the exclusion of **metaphysics** had yielded a secular academy policed by epistemic norms that bracket transcendent truth. Gregory aligns here with **Taylor’s** account of the **immanent frame** but adds that the loss is not only procedural but metaphysical. He advocates a return to a unitive **sapiential** vision in which the university recovers **integrative knowledge** anchored in **Thomistic metaphysics**, even as he recognizes the practical challenges posed by pluralism and intellectual specialization.

Equally programmatic is the analysis of **Subjectivizing Morality** and **Manufacturing the Goods**. Gregory rejects a simplistic **Weberian** causal link between ascetic Protestantism and capitalism, arguing instead that the collapse of shared **teleology** relocated moral authority to individuals and polities, clearing space for consumption to function as a surrogate summum bonum. Without a public **natural law** grammar adjudicated by an authoritative **church**, ethics devolved into negotiated interests, while expanding markets channeled desire toward **consumer capitalism**. This narrative offers a theological critique of modern economic life that resonates with **Catholic social teaching** and implies the need for institutions capable of forming the virtues commensurate with **beatitude** rather than affluence. The emphasis on **sacramental ontology** underwrites a vision of moral formation as ecclesially mediated participation in Christ, in sharp contrast to procedural ethics or expressive individualism.

In **Rebel in the Ranks** 2017, Gregory translated his arguments for a broader audience through a focused account of **Martin Luther**. He presents Luther as a theologian of compelling conscience whose protest against indulgences and late medieval penance found rapid expansion through **print culture**, political opportunity, and spiritual hunger. Yet the book’s through line remains the refrain of unintended outcomes. Luther’s insistence on **biblical authority** without an authoritative interpreter, combined with the empowerment of territorial rulers, precipitated doctrinal multiplicity and confessional states. The result, per Gregory, was an enduring pattern in which religious truth claims migrated into private conviction while public space became secular by default. The popularization does not dilute the thesis but clarifies the pastoral stakes that, for Gregory, can only be met by a renewed **Catholic** synthesis of truth, worship, and moral life.

Gregory’s work sits amid and against major interpretive schools. He appropriates **MacIntyre’s** notion that rationality is tradition-embedded to rebut liberal narratives of neutral reason. He draws on **Newman’s** insight into **doctrinal development** to argue that historical continuity does not demand stasis but ecclesially governed growth. He intersects with **Radical Orthodoxy** in his critique of secular autonomy and in his call for **sacramental participation**, though he is more historically granular and institutionally **magisterial**. His debts to **Oberman** and **Bossy** appear in attention to late medieval religious culture and the effects of **pastoral practice**. With **Taylor**, he maps the pathways to modern secularity yet insists more forthrightly on the need for **metaphysical realism**. Across these interlocutions Gregory contends that the battered but coherent **respublica Christiana** was replaced not by rational consensus but by contested sovereignties and private credenda.

Reception has been vigorous. Historians sympathetic to **confessionalization theory** and critical of grand narratives have queried the breadth of Gregory’s generalizations, alleging that **The Unintended Reformation** sometimes reduces the diversity of **Protestant** moral thought and collapses complex trajectories into a single arc of decline. Scholars have noted the presence of a strong **Catholic** desideratum, namely a renewed **magisterium** capable of resolving doctrinal indeterminacy, and have asked whether such a proposal attends sufficiently to **Catholic** failures and pluralities, including Jesuit and Dominican controversies. Protestant theologians have protested the representation of **sola scriptura** as interpretive anarchy, pointing to robust **confessional hermeneutics** and to the continuity of **classical theism** and **natural law** within **Reformed** and **Lutheran** orthodoxy. Gregory replies, in effect, that the durable fact of **hyperpluralism** and the secularity of public institutions instantiate his claim that Protestantism cannot provide a publicly binding, metaphysically rich common good.

Gregory’s constructive implication is not a bare nostalgia for medieval uniformity but a principled retrieval of **Thomistic metaphysics**, **sacramental ontology**, and **natural law** adjudicated by an authoritative **magisterium**. He envisions universities reintegrated under a sapiential conception of **theology**, polities ordered by the common good discerned through **ratio** elevated by **gratia**, and churches that mediate participation in the divine life. In that sense his historical narrative functions as political and moral theology aimed at the renewal of **Catholic integralism** in a chastened key. The wager is that only such a thick metaphysical and institutional account can rescue truth and moral order from the centrifuge of modern **pluralism**.

From a **Reformed** and Westminster Seminary perspective, one welcomes Gregory’s penetrating diagnosis of **hyperpluralism**, his critique of **expressivist individualism**, and his insistence that theology orders knowledge. Yet serious divergences remain. First, his portrayal of **sola scriptura** as inherently fragmenting overlooks a **covenantal epistemology** in which the **self-authenticating Word** with the **Spirit’s** internal testimony and the church’s **confessional** rule together furnish principled adjudication. Second, his appeal to **analogia entis** and **Thomistic natural law** prescinds from a **Reformed** insistence that all true **natural law** knowledge is covenantally situated and normed by **Scripture** as principium. Third, his call for a renewed **respublica Christiana** runs against the **two kingdoms** and **sphere sovereignty** doctrines that resist sacralizing the saeculum while honoring **Christ’s** comprehensive lordship. Finally, the Reformed can affirm **classical theism** and **divine simplicity** while rejecting a return to **magisterial** infallibility, proposing instead a chastened **Reformed catholicity** in which churches exercise discipline, cultivate virtue by Word and sacrament, and pursue common grace engagement without conceding the myth of religious neutrality. Gregory thus provokes salutary questions yet presses toward a solution that the **Reformed** tradition cannot, for principial reasons of revelation and covenant, embrace.
