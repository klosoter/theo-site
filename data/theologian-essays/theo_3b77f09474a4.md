### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Stephen B. Chapmans career is anchored at **Duke Divinity School**, a setting where **postliberal theology**, **canonical exegesis**, and **ecclesial hermeneutics** converged after the pivotal work of **Brevard S. Childs** and **Hans Frei**. In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, when discourse on **biblical authority** fractured between a skeptical historicism and a defensive fundamentalism, Chapman took up the task of reuniting **Old Testament studies** and **theological interpretation** under the rubric of the **canon**. He stands within a broad **evangelical** orbit but works self-consciously in the academy’s mainstream, learning from **historical criticism** even as he constrains it by **final-form** commitments and the **Rule of Faith**. The basic wager is methodological: **canon** is not simply a settled list but a **rule of reading** enacted in the church, so that Scripture’s identity is textual and ecclesial at once. This hybrid stance situates **The Law and the Prophets (2000; 2010)** alongside the canonical tradition of **Childs** and the exegetical theology of **Christopher R. Seitz**, with significant debts to **George Lindbeck’s** cultural-linguistic account of doctrine as rule, and with an ear for **Karl Barth’s** insistence on Scripture’s witness to the **self-revealing God**.

From the outset Chapman treated **method** as an ecclesial discipline. He has argued that the **final form** of the **Masoretic Text** is the proximate base for Christian reading, while also making room for **textual pluriformity** evidenced by the **Septuagint** and **Qumran**. The aim is neither to absolutize one textual tradition nor to dissolve normativity in plural texts. Instead, **canon** provides the theological form within which textual differences can be adjudicated as the church hears **Israel’s Scriptures** as **Christian Scripture**. This is not a retreat from history but a thickening of historical description by **theological teleology**: Israel’s Scriptures were gathered, used, and normed within communities whose practices of prayer, instruction, and juridical discernment produced a Scripture with coherent **scope** and **sense** for Christian doctrine.

The postliberal setting sharpened Chapmans attention to **language, rule, and practice**. He favors **figural reading** and **sensus plenior** when disciplined by canonical constraints. While sharing **Brevard Childs** suspicion of historicist fragmentation, he does not jettison **diachronic inquiry**; rather, he subordinates source and redaction theories to the theological claim that the **canonical form** is the Spirit’s providential instrument for the church. Thus, the **analogia fidei** coordinates exegesis and dogmatics, not by imposing doctrine on the text, but by recognizing the canon’s own self-organizing grammar around **election**, **covenant**, **promise**, and **kingdom**.

#### 2. The Law and the Prophets: canon formation as theological history
Chapman’s signature monograph, **The Law and the Prophets: A Study in Old Testament Canon Formation** first published in 2000 and reissued in 2010, makes the conceptual move that defines his oeuvre: **canon** must be described as a historical process that is itself theological. Against the minimalist chronology favored by some moderns, including **James Sanders** and at points **John Barton**, who stressed a late and fluid closure, Chapman draws together evidence from the **Sirach Prologue**, **Josephus**, the **Dead Sea Scrolls**, and rabbinic memory to argue for a substantive and relatively early canonical consciousness. He does not claim a fully fixed tripartite list in the Persian period, as **Roger Beckwith** sometimes suggests, but he shows that **Torah** and **Prophets** functioned early as authoritative corpora, with the **Writings** coalescing over time into a third segment that was treated as Scripture prior to its tight closure. The book’s thesis presses a middle path: **canon formation** is neither late and merely sociological nor pristine and instantaneous, but rather an extended practice of reception where communities recognize the **voice of God** through Israel’s authoritative traditions in ways that gradually yield a **tripartite canon**.

Central to this argument is the distinction between **canon as list** and **canon as rule**. By canon as list Chapman means the delimitation of authoritative books. By canon as rule he means the corporate practices of reading, interpreting, and adjudicating that render the list operational within the community’s life. The **Qumran** library’s textual pluriformity, including **proto-Masoretic**, **pre-Samaritan**, and **LXX-like** forms, reveals not canonical chaos but canonical work under way. Different textual forms participate in a recognizably authoritative tradition that is already normed by the **Torah** and guided by prophetic and sapiential frames of discernment. Thus, the church’s acceptance of **Israel’s Scriptures** is not an alien imposition but a continuation of Israel’s own canonical labor now oriented toward **Christ**. This yields a theologically freighted historiography: the **Spirit’s providence** presides over the emergence of a material text and a constraining rule of use.

The book is also a methodological intervention in the debate between **historical criticism** and **canonical criticism**. Chapman insists that the data require both tools: historical analysis to describe the growth and transmission of textual collections, canonical analysis to explain how those collections attain **normative status**. He is willing to disagree with **Beckwith’s** early-closure confidence while pushing **Sanders** and **McDonald** to concede the force of the early dual-division **Law and Prophets** and the structured movement toward a third. In so doing, he reframes canonical talk for Christian dogmatics: **Scripture’s authority** is not merely posited by inspiration but recognized by a Spirit-led people who learned how to read these writings as **God’s Word** under the **Rule of Faith**.

#### 3. Text, pluriformity, and the problem of stability
An abiding contribution of Chapman’s work is his nuanced treatment of **textual pluriformity** and **canonical stability**. The discovery of textual diversity at **Qumran** unsettled earlier assumptions that a single fixed **Masoretic Text** governed Second Temple reading. Some scholars concluded that canon could not yet exist without textual uniformity. Chapman disputes the inference. He argues that communities can and did maintain **canonical identity** through stable content and recognizable literary shape even amid textual variation. The **Septuagint** functions here not as a rival Bible but as a permissible and sometimes clarifying witness to the same authoritative traditions. Theologically, this allows the church to receive the **Old Testament** in more than one textual instantiation while sustaining a conviction that God has preserved the **Scripture** sufficient for **teaching, reproof, and training in righteousness**.

This stance enables a constructive account of **providence** without imposing a brittle theory of **inerrant autograph** retrieval. The canon’s authority is not located in a hypothesized perfect text but in the **Spirit-governed economy** by which texts and interpretive norms converge to form a coherent Scriptural voice. Chapman likewise resists an easy relativism. He regards the **Masoretic tradition** as primary for Christian liturgy and theology while granting the **LXX** a derivative but sometimes normatively instructive role, especially where New Testament writers employ it. The result is a **canonical realism** that treats Scripture as a determinate set of writings with determinate shapes, open to textual criticism and yet more than the sum of variants.

#### 4. Theological interpretation and Christian reading of the Old Testament
Chapman is a leading voice in the contemporary movement for **theological interpretation of Scripture**. His essays in the **Dictionary for Theological Interpretation of the Bible (2005)** and in the **Scripture and Hermeneutics Series (2006)** argue that exegesis belongs to the dogmatic and liturgical life of the church. Scripture, in his account, is ordered by God to yield **wisdom** for **discipleship**, not only historical information. Thus he retrieves **figural reading** conditioned by the **canon** and executed under the **Rule of Faith**, a stance resonant with **Augustine**, enriched by **Aquinas**, and sharpened by **Childs** modern canonical sensibilities. Key notions like **sensus plenior** are treated carefully. He stresses that fuller spiritual senses are not private revelations but the fruit of the canon’s own compositional and editorial trajectories, culminating for Christians in **Christ** who gathers up Israel’s story without erasing Israel’s ongoing witness.

Here Chapman’s debt to **Christopher Seitz** is evident. Seitz’s insistence on the **continuing voice of the Old Testament** as Old Testament helps Chapman avoid collapsing Israel’s Scriptures into mere preparation for a New Testament center. For Chapman the **Old Testament’s testimony** to **covenant**, **election**, **holiness**, and **kingdom** continues to norm Christian faith beyond its explicit christological appropriation. The **church** learns fundamental theological grammar from Torah and Prophets that stabilizes doctrine and resists both antinomianism and moralism. This ecclesial orientation renders his work pastorally potent in seminaries and judicatories hungry for a responsible way back to **Scripture as Scripture**.

#### 5. 1 Samuel as Christian Scripture: exegesis under the Rule of Faith
In **1 Samuel as Christian Scripture: A Theological Commentary** published in 2016, Chapman exemplifies his method on the terrain of royal narrative. The commentary treats **monarchy**, **divine election**, **prophetic authority**, and **Davidic promise** as doctrinal knots that must be untied within the **canon’s** literary and theological shape. He reads **Hannah’s song** as a theological overture setting themes of **reversal**, **holiness**, and **kingly power**; he construes **Saul’s tragedy** not as an object lesson in psychological pathology but as a canonical reflection on **obedience**, **sacrifice**, and the danger of **instrumental piety**; and he hears in the **Davidic narrative** a figural pattern that opens toward **messianic kingship** without collapsing **David** into **Christ**. 

Crucially, Chapman’s commentary integrates **historical-critical awareness** with **final-form** attention to literary structure. He acknowledges redactional seams and compositional complexity, yet he treats the extant form as the Spirit-given arena for theological judgment. The **Rule of Faith** functions not as a Procrustean bed but as an orientation device: it signals that the God who speaks in 1 Samuel is the **one God of Israel**, creator and redeemer, who brings his promises to their telos in **Jesus Christ** and by the **Spirit** forms a people whose polity and worship stand under the judgment and promise of **kingship**. The commentary therefore models the kind of doctrinally thick exegesis that can serve preaching, catechesis, and moral discernment, making **Scripture’s authority** concrete in the church’s life.

#### 6. Scripture, church, and authority: canon as a rule of reading
Chapman’s writings consistently articulate **canon** as the nexus where **Scripture**, **church**, and **authority** meet. He resists the binary that pits **sola Scriptura** against **tradition** by retrieving a Protestant account in which Scripture is materially sufficient while ecclesial **rules of faith** guide its reading. The canon becomes a **rule of reading** that stabilizes meaning by constraining interpretive options according to the church’s baptismal confession of the **Triune God**. He thus draws on **Lindbeck’s** grammatical analogy: the canon is like the language of faith whose usage is trained by community practices, creeds, and liturgy. 

In this register Chapman often functions as a constructive mediator in debates about **biblical inerrancy**, **inspiration**, and **the sufficiency of Scripture**. He emphasizes that **inspiration** is best confessed with respect to the **canonical writings** in their final form, not reconstructed autographs, and that **truthfulness** is a theological property of Scripture’s capacity to accomplish God’s ends in the church. He is cautious about imposing late-modern precisionism on ancient texts, but he is equally wary of a loose pluralism that vacates Scripture’s normativity. Authority emerges from the Spirit’s providential act of joining texts and ecclesial use into a living **canon**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates: between Beckwith and Sanders, beyond Brueggemann
Chapman’s canon theory positions him between **Roger Beckwith** and **James Sanders**. From **Beckwith** he accepts the strength of early canonical consciousness and the principled ordering of books; from **Sanders** he receives the insight that **canon** is a process inseparable from community use. But he resists **Beckwith’s** sometimes rigid closure claims and **Sanders’** tendency to relativize normativity. With **John Barton** he shares a distaste for confessional overreach in historical description, yet he argues Barton underestimates the theological shape of reception. In dialogue with **Lee Martin McDonald** he underlines that historical indeterminacy need not entail theological ambivalence. And in conversation with **evangelical** proposals like **Michael Kruger’s** self-authenticating model for the New Testament, Chapman proposes a complementary emphasis: the **Old Testament canon** displays self-attesting qualities within and through **ecclesial recognition** rather than apart from it.

He also engages the theological readings of **Walter Brueggemann**, whose rhetorical pluralism celebrates Israel’s contested speech. Chapman appreciates the descriptive power of that approach but finds it insufficiently canonical. The canon does not silence contest but arranges Israel’s polyphony around a governing confession of **YHWH’s holiness, righteousness, and steadfast love**, giving the church criteria for **judgment** and **hope**. In this way he aligns more closely with **Christopher Seitz’s** account of the Old Testament’s continuing voice and with **Childs’** theological introduction that treats the **Masoretic canon** as the primary vehicle of scriptural witness.

#### 8. Theology through exegesis: God, election, and Israel-church relations
Chapman’s doctrinal proposals arise through exegesis rather than through standalone dogmatic treatises. His handling of **monotheism**, **election**, and **covenant** in historical books and prophetic literature stresses the **unity of God’s action** and the **continuity of God’s people**. He rejects reductive **supersessionism** by attending to the ongoing witness of Israel within the canon and by reading **Christological fulfillment** as a deepening rather than a displacement. At the same time he insists that Christian confession of **Jesus as Messiah** is the hermeneutical key that unlocks the canon’s **sensus plenior**. 

On ethical and political questions he reads the **monarchy** of Israel as a cautionary and promissory sign. The king stands under **Torah**, and the life of God’s people is structured by **holiness**, **justice**, and **mercy** as expounded in prophetic critique. This theological shape guards against both sacral nationalism and an anemic privatization of faith. The **church**, learning Israel’s grammar, bears witness to the **kingdom of God** as a polity defined by the **Word**, the **Spirit**, and the **sacraments**, whose authority is normed by the **canon** that gave it speech in the first place.

#### 9. Contributions, limits, and a Reformed/WTS evaluation
The durable contribution of Stephen B. Chapman is the rearticulation of **canon** as both list and rule, a move that reunites **Old Testament scholarship** and **dogmatics** without collapsing one into the other. He has shown how **textual pluriformity** can coexist with **canonical stability**, how the **Masoretic Text** and **Septuagint** can be received within a single theological economy, and how **figural reading** can be practiced responsibly under the **Rule of Faith**. In a scholarly world tempted either by historicist reduction or by confessional insulation, his work invites a chastened, ecclesially located confidence: the church can read **Israel’s Scriptures** as **Christian Scripture** with intellectual integrity and spiritual fruitfulness.

From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, appreciations and cautions come together. Positively, Chapman’s **canonical approach**, attention to the **final form**, and affirmation of the Old Testament’s continuing voice resonate with **covenantal theology**, **autopistia Scripturae** in the sense that Scripture bears its own divine marks, and **redemptive-historical unity** that moves from promise to fulfillment. His rule-governed **figural reading** aligns with the classic **analogia fidei**. Yet tensions remain. By casting **authority** primarily in terms of ecclesial **canon as rule**, he risks blurring the ontic primacy of the **Word of God** speaking in Scripture over the church’s recognizing act, where the **Westminster Confession** accents Scripture’s **self-authentication**, **inspiration**, **perspicuity**, and **providential preservation** of the text. His willingness to live with robust **textual pluriformity** can sound to Reformed ears like a concession that destabilizes the confessional claim of a sufficiently stable and norming text. Finally, while he champions **christological fulfillment**, his theological method could integrate more explicit commitments to **verbal plenary inspiration** and to Scripture’s **truthfulness** in all that it affirms, thereby clarifying how canonical process serves rather than founds divine authority. A Reformed alternative would press the priority of God’s **covenantal speech-act** that constitutes the canon’s authority, employ **self-authenticating** criteria that are intrinsic rather than primarily communal, and articulate **providence** not only over canonical reception but also over the preservation of a materially stable text norming the church’s hearing of **Christ**.
