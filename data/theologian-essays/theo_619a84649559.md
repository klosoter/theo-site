### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Douglas Farrow emerged as a leading contemporary Roman Catholic voice shaped by **late-modern secularism**, a Canadian civic context, and the ressourcement impulse associated with **Henri de Lubac** and **Joseph Ratzinger**. Teaching at **McGill University** in Montreal, he works where **public philosophy** and **dogmatic theology** intersect, addressing not only the academy but legislatures and courts on matters like **marriage**, **religious liberty**, and the **common good**. His intellectual home is the patristic and scholastic tradition of **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and **Thomas Aquinas**, deployed to recover a robust **sacramental ontology** against the **immanent frame** analyzed by **Charles Taylor**. In this matrix, Farrow’s signature conviction is that the **Ascension** and **heavenly session** of Christ provide the metaphysical and political horizon for the church’s life, a horizon that reorders cosmology, ecclesiology, and moral reasoning.

The methodological hallmark is a deliberately **christological-cosmological method**: dogmatics begins with the **rule of faith**, follows the **economy** of the Son from **incarnation** through **ascension**, and reads the world through the **heavenly session** in which Christ now reigns. Farrow makes constant use of **recapitulation and theosis**, treating the Son’s ascent not as epilogue but as the cosmic enthronement that conditions **sacrament**, **liturgy**, and **mission**. He insists on **divine simplicity** and the integrity of **Trinitarian processions** while practicing a ressourcement correction of neo-scholastic **pura natura**, holding instead a **nature and grace** relation in which creation is destined for **beatific vision**. The result is a thick **sacramental realism** that resists modern **nominalism** and a political ethic that treats **Christus Victor** and **Kyrios** as public, not merely private, truths.

Farrow’s method is as much political as it is dogmatic, juxtaposing **auctoritas and potestas** to expose the state’s tendency toward sacralized **sovereignty**. Following **Augustine’s two cities**, he contends that the church’s **auctoritas** flows from the **ascension** and must not be eclipsed by the state’s **potestas**. This reframing is central to his critique of both liberal statism and postmodern ecclesiologies that dissolve **apostolic succession**, **magisterium**, and **sacrament** into sociological forms. His tools include **analogia entis** understood christologically, **analogia fidei** for scriptural reception, and a keen sense of the **eschatological reserve** that marks the church’s pilgrim status.

#### 2. Ascension and ecclesiology
Farrow’s early monograph **Ascension and Ecclesia** (1999) set the trajectory. There he argues that the **ascension and heavenly session** are not optional articles but the pivot on which **ecclesiology** and **cosmology** turn. The church is configured by the risen Lord’s absence and presence: his **real bodily absence** from the terrestrial realm establishes both the transcendence of his lordship and the conditions for **sacramental presence** mediated by the **Spirit**. Drawing on **Athanasius** and **Augustine**, Farrow depicts the **Eucharist** as the site where the ascended Christ communicates himself under sacramental signs, while the church’s mission participates in his **royal priesthood**. The claim that **cosmos** is now ordered around Christ’s **session** entails a re-reading of space and time as liturgically open to the **civitas Dei**, a theme that recurs in his later **liturgical theology**.

In **Ascension Theology** (2011), he consolidates this **ascension hermeneutic** and clarifies the delicate balance between **real absence** and **sacramental presence**. Against modern immanentism and certain eucharistic misreadings, he insists that the **ascended humanity** of Christ retains its spatially finite integrity. Here Farrow enters classic debates between **Calvin’s extra Calvinisticum** and **Lutheran communicatio idiomatum**, arguing that Christ’s **bodily location** at the right hand of the Father is the very condition for his universal Lordship and sacramental self-giving. The **Spirit** is not a substitute for Christ but the **personal medium** who unites the faithful to the **ascended Christ** in word and sacrament. This safeguards both **Christological orthodoxy** and the **objectivity of the Eucharist**, while preventing a collapse of presence into ubiquitous immanence.

This ascension-centric pattern yields a distinctive **ecclesiology**: the church is truly catholic because it is stretched between altar and throne, between **anamnesis** on earth and **parousia** from heaven. **Apostolic succession** and **magisterial authority** function to preserve contact with the ascended Lord through **traditio** of the **regula fidei**. The church’s unity is not merely federated consensus but participation in the **one body** governed from the heavenly session. The **communio** tradition of **de Lubac** and **Ratzinger** informs Farrow’s insistence that the Eucharist makes the church even as the church celebrates the Eucharist, with the **ascension** ensuring that this mutuality remains ordered by the Lord who is both **absent in body** and **present in mystery**.

#### 3. Soteriology, anthropology, and sacramentality
In **Theological Negotiations: Proposals in Soteriology and Anthropology** (2018), Farrow gathers essays that display his integrative instincts across **atonement**, **original sin**, **bodily resurrection**, and **theosis**. He rejects reductive theories by harmonizing **Anselmian satisfaction** with **Christus Victor** and **sacrificial substitution**, identifying the Cross as the judgment and mercy of the ascended Judge enacted in time. His anthropology is adamic and christocentric: **recapitulation** in the second Adam entails not merely moral renovation but participatory **deification**, secured by incorporation into the ascended Christ through **baptism** and **Eucharist**. He is unembarrassed by **original sin** as both guilt and corruption, though he nuances juridical language with **Augustinian** accounts of disordered love and **Aquinas’s** metaphysics of habitus.

Farrow’s **sacramental ontology** grounds his view of the human as liturgical animal ordered to **beatific vision**. He resists **pura natura** by following **de Lubac** in denying that there is a closed natural end divorced from the supernatural. Nature is graced from origin, yet grace is not nature’s possession. In his account, **analogia entis** is not a metaphysical ladder but a christologically stabilized participation, made ecclesially concrete in **sacrament** and **liturgy**. The implication for moral theology is decisive: anthropology cannot be reconstructed by **bioethics**, **gender theory**, or civil statute without reference to the **ascended Lord** who now determines the human telos. Hence his resistance to technocratic manipulations of the body and his defense of sexual difference as creational gift sanctified in **marriage**.

This defense took public form in **Nation of Bastards: Essays on the End of Marriage** (2007), where Farrow criticized the state’s redefinition of **marriage** as an act of religious self-assertion by **potestas** against the **auctoritas** of nature and revelation. He argued from **natural law** and **sacramentum** that conjugal union orders procreation, family, and polity, and that ecclesial witness must be prepared to suffer civil marginalization rather than capitulate. The same logic underwrites his wider interventions on **religious liberty**, where he frames coercive neutrality as a myth that displaces the **kingship of Christ** with a jealous sovereignty of the state.

#### 4. Political theology and public witness
Farrow develops these public themes programmatically in **Desiring a Better Country: Forays in Political Theology** (2015). There he mines **Augustine’s two cities**, **Aquinas’s** account of law, and **New Testament** claims about **Kyrios** to argue that political order must remain penultimate under the **heavenly session**. The state’s **potestas** is legitimate but limited by the church’s **auctoritas**, and both are subordinated to the ascended Christ who judges nations. Farrow faults both **liberal proceduralism** for sacralizing neutrality and **integralist shortcuts** for confusing eschatological tempo; he calls instead for a **martyrial politics** that witnesses liturgically and doctrinally to a kingdom not of this world yet decisively for this world.

In this political theology, the **Eucharist** is public: it re-forms space and time as a prophetic counter-polity, not by violence but by doxology. Farrow’s reading of **temple-cosmos** through the **ascension** yields a critique of sovereign territoriality and a theology of borders hospitable to the **pilgrim people**. He navigates debates with **John Milbank** and **Radical Orthodoxy**, appreciating their metaphysical retrieval while warning against romanticized visions of Christendom insufficiently chastened by **eschatological reserve**. His use of **auctoritas and potestas** clarifies why the church’s catechesis must not be subordinated to state pedagogies, particularly in education and family policy, and why **conscientious objection** belongs to the grammar of faithful citizenship.

Farrow also presses a de-idolization of the academy. The **immanent frame** as described by **Charles Taylor** is for Farrow a construal to be unlearned through **ascension**. Theology, for him, is not simply religion’s reflection within the frame but the intellectual extension of worship of the **ascended Christ**. This entails a metaphysics of participation that disallows methodologically naturalist constraints on truth claims about **creation ex nihilo**, **providence**, and **miracle**. It also underwrites a hermeneutic that resists reducing **Scripture** to historical criticism, defending **canon**, **tradition**, and **magisterium** as the proper ecology for reading under the **Spirit**.

#### 5. Interlocutors and doctrinal debates
Farrow’s chief allies are the Fathers and the ressourcement theologians, but his work often sharpens itself against **Protestant** and **modern** proposals. He engages **Karl Barth** on **revelation** and **Christology**, appreciating Barth’s centering of the Word while querying the tendency to collapse **analogia entis** into sheer **analogia fidei**, which Farrow fears jeopardizes **sacramental objectivity** and **natural law**. With **Jürgen Moltmann**, Farrow contests speculative **trinitarian kenosis** that risks fracturing **divine simplicity** and turning the **ascension** into mere narrative flourish rather than ontological enthronement. His dialogue with **John Milbank** registers sympathy for metaphysical retrieval but insists that the **ascension and heavenly session** provide clearer coordinates than nostalgia for Christendom.

Eucharistic debates draw him into classical confessional territory. Farrow wishes to avoid a **ubiquitarian** reading of the **communicatio idiomatum** as found in some **Lutheran** treatments while preserving the fullness of **real presence** more robustly than minimal **Reformed** accounts sometimes allow. He deploys **Calvin’s extra Calvinisticum** positively, not to deny presence but to insist that the **ascended humanity** is the source and measure of eucharistic participation. This yields a refined **transubstantiation** that insists on Christ’s bodily absence with sacramental presence through **Spirit-mediated conversion of the elements**, thereby safeguarding both **Christology** and **sacrament** under the **ascension**.

On **nature and grace**, Farrow follows **de Lubac** in repudiating **pura natura** and aligns with **Ratzinger’s** communio ecclesiology, yet he attempts to maintain **Aquinas’s** integrity of created causes and **natural law**. The result is a nuanced **analogia entis** that is not an autonomous metaphysical bridge but a covenantal participation opened by the **Incarnation-Ascension**. He anchors this in **Irenaeus’s recapitulation**, such that anthropology, ethics, and politics all take their shape from the **ascended Christ**, who reconfigures human ends without destroying creaturely goods. The outlook is eschatological without escapism, public without triumphalism, sacramental without magic.

Farrow’s style is unapologetically **dogmatic and polemical**, yet often pastoral. He returns again and again to the **ascension** as theologically generative, making of it a kind of **regulative principle** for ecclesiology and public theology. His voice resonates with readers weary of **immanentist reduction** and eager for a Christianity that confesses **Christ’s kingship** in the liturgy and in civil society. He succeeds in showing that doctrine, rightly ordered, is public truth with civic consequence, and that **church and world** can only be healed by the One who reigns from heaven.

#### 6. A single integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Farrow’s centering of the **ascension and heavenly session** is a salutary rebalancing of modern dogmatics, aligning with **two-kingdoms** instincts that relativize civil **potestas** under Christ’s **auctoritas**. His chastened **political theology**, resistance to **immanentism**, and affirmation of **creation ex nihilo**, **divine simplicity**, and a strong **doctrine of sin** commend themselves. Yet tensions remain. First, his **sacramental ontology** and refined **transubstantiation** risk reintroducing a metaphysical necessity that the Reformed prefer to tether to the **covenantal Word-Spirit** economy rather than to ontological conversion of elements; a robust **real spiritual presence** could secure ascension-ordered communion without committing to **transubstantiation**. Second, his use of **analogia entis**, even christologically chastened, can appear to the Reformed as an epistemic overreach that underestimates **noetic effects of sin** and the sufficiency of **analogia fidei**. Third, his appeal to **magisterial authority** and **apostolic succession** is viewed as displacing the primacy of **Scripture’s self-authentication** and the church’s ministerial authority under the **Word**. Finally, his **nature and grace** synthesis, while rightly rejecting **pura natura**, still tilts toward a **sacramental metaphysics** that may blur the covenantal distinction of **law and gospel** and the pilgrim character of the church’s polity. A Reformed alternative would appropriate Farrow’s **ascension hermeneutic** and **public Christology**, deepen it through **covenant theology** and **Word-Spirit** centrality, and locate ecclesial authority in the ministerial service of Scripture, thereby preserving his political insights while reconfiguring his sacramental and epistemic claims.
