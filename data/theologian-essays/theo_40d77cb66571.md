### ESSAY
#### 1. Context, formation, and method
Emerging from the Australian Anglican evangelical tradition centered on **Moore Theological College**, **David G. Peterson** belongs to the cohort of late twentieth-century scholars who rebuilt the credibility of evangelical **biblical theology** within the academy. His early formation integrated rigorous Greek exegesis and canonical sensibility fostered by postwar British evangelicals like **F. F. Bruce** and **I. Howard Marshall**, even as he maintained a pastorally inflected ecclesial orientation. The historical context was one of contested hermeneutics as the age of redaction criticism widened into sociological and rhetorical readings of **Second Temple** texts, while confessional voices insisted that theological integrity must flow from the canon’s unified witness. Against this background, Peterson’s self-conscious method is a canonical, salvation-historical approach that privileges the intratextual coherence of Scripture on themes such as **holiness**, **worship**, and **new covenant**. He calibrates historical-critical tools to serve rather than rule theological judgment, and he consistently interprets the New Testament within the already-not-yet **eschatological** horizon, a move that structures his accounts of **sanctification**, **worship**, and **mission**.

Peterson’s epistemic stance is that of evangelical realism: Scripture is the normative voice of the living God, the **Word** that creates and defines the people to whom the **Spirit** gives access to the Father through the Son. The idiom of *latreia* and *proskynein* is not frozen in ancient cultus but is redefined by the cross, resurrection, and Pentecost. His exegetical procedure combines lexical-semantic analysis with discourse-level tracing of themes across corpora, notably **Hebrews**, **Paul**, **John**, and **Luke-Acts**. The result is a theological physiognomy of the New Testament that orders ethics beneath ontology, insisting that Christian doing rests on God’s prior act of consecration in Christ. This methodological axiom recurs in his signature contribution: **definitive sanctification** as the ground of progressive transformation.

#### 2. Hebrews and the grammar of access
Peterson’s academic debut, **Hebrews and Perfection** 1982, set the trajectory for his career by reframing the contested term *teleiosis* in **Hebrews**. Rather than moral flawlessness, *teleiosis* denotes cultic realization: access to God, cleansed conscience, and unimpeded approach through the high-priestly ministry of **Jesus Christ**. He argues that the once-for-all sacrifice achieves definitive removal of barriers, with *parrhesia* to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus as the hallmark of the new order. The argument is not a merely lexical correction; it is a theological realignment that locates Christian perfection in the **new covenant** reconstitution of worship around the heavenly high priest, not in incremental ethical achievement. The result is a matrix in which **sanctification**, **worship**, and **assurance** are correlative: to be sanctified is to be set apart for access; to worship is to exercise that access; to persevere is to hold fast to that access amid trials.

In engaging rival accounts, Peterson resists both moralistic readings that turn **Hebrews** into a ladder of virtue and perfectionist schemes inflected by **Wesleyan** holiness movements. He converses with major interpreters like **C. K. Barrett** and later with **Harold Attridge** and **William Lane**, arguing that the epistle’s cultic logic must control the moral discourse, not the reverse. The warnings of Hebrews are thereby situated within covenantal access: apostasy is not defect of performance so much as abandonment of the priestly access granted in Christ. This thesis anticipates his mature claims in **Engaging with God** and **Possessed by God**, where holiness is first a status conferred by union with Christ and only then a vocation of transformation by the Spirit.

#### 3. Worship as gospel-driven life
In **Engaging with God: A Biblical Theology of Worship** 1992, Peterson makes a programmatic claim: the New Testament relocates **worship** from place and ritual to person and gospel. Here he traces the movement from tabernacle and temple to the crucified-and-risen **Messiah** and the **Spirit**-constituted community. Key texts include **John 4** on worship in Spirit and truth, **Romans 12** where *logikē latreia* denotes whole-of-life presentation to God, and **Hebrews 10–13** where sacrificial language is spiritualized into confession, praise, and doing good. Peterson insists that gathered assembly is vital but is not itself the exclusive site of worship; rather, corporate meetings equip the people of God for comprehensive **latreia** in the world. Theologically, this move dissolves nostalgia for cultic replicas and rebukes consumerist eventism, centering the **Word** and **gospel** as the vehicles of God’s presence.

Interlocutors include liturgical and evangelical voices such as **James F. White**, **Robert Webber**, and apologetic conversation with the retrieval of patristic and medieval rites. Peterson accepts the catholic insight that worship is participation in the Son’s priestly self-offering but resists any re-sacralization of time, space, or ordained performance that would obscure **Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice**. He elevates congregational edification, intelligibility, and mutual ministry, interacting with **1 Corinthians 14** to commend Word-led, prayerful gatherings animated by the **Spirit**. The stress on the priesthood of all believers reframes music, sacraments, and preaching as means of gospel engagement rather than quasi-cultic appeasements. The leitmotif is clear: acceptable **worship** is evangelical before it is aesthetic or ceremonial, a thesis that has decisively shaped evangelical practice.

#### 4. Sanctification as consecration and transformation
Peterson’s **Possessed by God: A New Testament Theology of Sanctification and Holiness** 1995 buttresses his worship thesis with a concentrated account of **sanctification**. Mining Pauline and wider New Testament usage of *hagiazō* and *hagiasmos*, he argues that sanctification is primarily definitive, an act of divine consecration that transfers a people into **God’s possession**. This relational holiness is then the platform for progressive renewal by the **Spirit**, so that imperative grows organically from indicative. Peterson dialogues with **John Murray’s** seminal essay on **definitive sanctification**, aligning with Murray’s insistence that union with Christ includes a once-for-all breach with sin’s dominion. He further engages **James D. G. Dunn** and **E. P. Sanders** where covenantal nomism might blur the forensic and the transformative, contending that the New Testament maintains both a definitive sanctifying act and a Spirit-wrought process of renewal.

Theologically, the book corrects two opposite missteps. Against **perfectionist** strands, he denies a post-conversion second blessing that eradicates sin; against **quietist** piety, he disallows a passivity that mistakes consecration for completion. The church is holy because it belongs to God, and therefore it must become in practice what it already is by status. Peterson’s synthesis weaves **union with Christ**, **adoption**, and **temple-presence** into a coherent sanctification schema: the Spirit indwells as down payment, fulfilling **Ezekiel 36** and **Jeremiah 31**, so that the people who have access in **Hebrews** now embody holiness in concrete obedience. His pastoral accent is unmistakable: assurance rests on consecration accomplished by Christ, while urgency arises from the Spirit’s enabling presence.

#### 5. Luke-Acts: the mission of the word and the Spirit
The commentary **The Acts of the Apostles** in the Pillar New Testament Commentary 2009 distills Peterson’s convictions into a narrative frame of **salvation-history**. He highlights the **word of God** as the active agent that grows and prevails, reading programmatic summaries such as Acts 6:7 and 12:24 as theological signposts. The **Spirit** is not a detachable power but the eschatological gift who equips witness to the crucified and risen **Jesus** in continuity with **Luke’s** gospel. Peterson argues for substantial historical reliability of the speeches, differentiating rhetorical adaptation from fabrication, and converses with **C. K. Barrett**, **F. F. Bruce**, and **Ben Witherington** on historical and literary method. The Jerusalem Council is treated as a decisive recognition of **Gentile inclusion** without the imposition of Torah boundary markers, the outworking of prophetic promises like **Amos 9**.

Ecclesiologically, Acts supplies a pattern of Word-centered assemblies, elder leadership, and sacraments that serve the gospel rather than confect it. Peterson reads *kerygma*, *didachē*, and fellowship as interwoven marks of the mission church. He resists a pneumatic triumphalism that severs **Spirit** from **Scripture**, and he tempers restorative narratives with sober recognition of suffering and opposition. Theologically, Acts functions as the hinge text that ties his accounts of **worship** and **sanctification** to **mission**: the holy people who have access in **Hebrews** and present their bodies in **Romans 12** are precisely those propelled into public witness through the spread of the **word**.

#### 6. New covenant ministry and ethical transformation
In **Transformed by God: New Covenant Life and Ministry** 2012, Peterson revisits **2 Corinthians 3**, **Jeremiah 31**, and **Ezekiel 36** to articulate a theology of **new covenant** existence. The veil is lifted, the heart inscribed by the Spirit, and the ministry of righteousness eclipses the old covenant ministry of condemnation. This argument reinforces his earlier claims: transformation is real, rooted in definitive consecration, and realized through the illuminating work of the **Spirit** who turns to the Lord. Peterson contests readings that flatten continuity or deny abiding moral norms; he argues that new covenant freedom is the freedom to obey, not the liberty to dismiss **God’s law**. Here he wrestles implicitly with **N. T. Wright** and **James D. G. Dunn** on the shape of Pauline ethics and explicitly with pastoral tendencies to instrumentalize grace as license.

The work also refines his account of ministry. Ministers are stewards of the **gospel** whose competence is from God, not proprietors of sacramental power. He warns against managerial and entertainment paradigms of church leadership and returns to **1 Corinthians 3–4** to underline the cross-shaped pattern of apostolic service. Throughout, Peterson’s consistent hermeneutic surfaces: the new covenant is not a mystical erasure of form but a Spirit-given capacity for the obedience of faith, in which **Word** and **Spirit** operate inseparably to produce Christlike character.

#### 7. Consolidation: Hebrews anew and pastoral-theological synthesis
Peterson’s late-career **Hebrews** volume in the Tyndale New Testament Commentaries 2020 consolidates decades of research on **temple**, **access**, and **perseverance**. The commentary is marked by exegetical economy and pastoral clarity, parsing the epistle’s rhetorical progression from Christ’s superiority to priestly efficacy and community endurance. He revisits *teleiosis*, *synēdēsis* conscience, and *parrhesia*, arguing that assurance of **access** anchors the exhortations to hold fast and not shrink back. The notorious warning passages are interpreted through the lens of covenantal privilege: to despise the Son’s priestly mediation after receiving the knowledge of the truth is to forfeit the very **sanctification** once enjoyed in the community, a sober call to perseverance rather than speculative soteriology.

The volume also refines positions on **Sabbath rest** in Hebrews 3–4, commending an inaugurated-escalated rest that is entered now by faith and consummated eschatologically. He maintains that the cultic abolition achieved by **Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice** renders any return to temple ritual theologically incoherent, a conclusion that safeguards his core thesis about **worship** as gospel-shaped life. In sum, the TNTC Hebrews crystallizes Peterson’s integration: consecration yields access; access issues in worship; worship flowers into perseverance and ethical fruit.

#### 8. Doctrinal architecture: belonging, beholding, becoming
Across his corpus, Peterson offers a threefold architecture that binds **sanctification**, **worship**, and **mission**. First, belonging: by union with **Christ** and the gift of the **Spirit**, believers are definitively sanctified, transferred into God’s possession, and granted unhindered access. Second, beholding: in gathered assembly and dispersed vocation, the church engages the living God through the **Word**, prayer, praise, and mutual upbuilding, not to make God present but because God has made himself present in the gospel. Third, becoming: the same Spirit who confers status progressively transforms character into the image of **Christ**, fulfilling the **new covenant** promises and enabling public witness to the **kingdom**. This architecture is framed by an eschatological horizon: the church lives between the times, already perfected with respect to access, not yet perfected with respect to moral completion.

Peterson’s doctrine of Scripture and the **Word** underwrites the whole. In **Acts** and across his theological syntheses, the Word is living and active, the seed of the new creation. The church does not stand over the Word as master of ceremonies; it stands under the Word as the place where God addresses his people. This perspective guards the primacy of preaching and catechesis while honoring the sacraments as enacted Word. It also grounds his critique of performative worship cultures and moralistic sanctification schemes. Theologically, the through-line is a robust evangelical confidence that the **gospel** announces reality before issuing demands, and that obedience is the free activity of those who are already holy in **Christ**.

#### 9. Interlocution and influence
Peterson’s dialogues with **F. F. Bruce**, **I. Howard Marshall**, and **Gordon Fee** exhibit his shared commitment to the **Spirit** and the **Word** within a rigorous exegetical discipline. His friendly debates with **James D. G. Dunn** and the **new perspective on Paul** reflect his reluctance to collapse sanctification into membership badges or to recode holiness as mere boundary maintenance. In liturgical theology, he stands in creative tension with renewal movements associated with **Robert Webber**, appreciative of retrieval yet wary of re-ritualization that could veil **Christ’s sufficiency**. His synergy with **John Murray** on **definitive sanctification** signals compatibility with classical Reformed soteriology, even as his Anglican location gives his ecclesiology a broad-evangelical elasticity.

Influentially, **Engaging with God** has become a standard evangelical primer on worship, reframing church practice toward intelligibility, edification, and gospel centrality. **Possessed by God** has corrected pietist imbalances by recovering belonging as the basis for becoming, while the **Pillar Acts** commentary serves pastors and scholars with a balanced historical-theological reading of Luke’s narrative. The net effect is a coherent evangelical vision: access by the Son, empowerment by the **Spirit**, formation by the **Word**, and vocation in **mission** until the eschaton.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster perspective, Peterson’s project largely harmonizes with **union with Christ**, **definitive and progressive sanctification**, and a **Word-and-Spirit** ministry. His reading of **Hebrews** on *teleiosis* and access resonates with **Calvin’s** account of priestly mediation and with confessional insistence on the once-for-all character of **Christ’s sacrifice**. His sanctification thesis dovetails with **Westminster** on the priority of the indicative and the inseparability of justification and sanctification without confusion. Two tensions invite dialogue. First, on **worship**, Peterson’s expansive whole-of-life emphasis rightly dethrones ritualism, yet Reformed advocates of the **regulative principle** may press for stronger articulation of the Lord’s Day assembly as the covenantal center where the instituted means of grace, especially **preaching** and the **sacraments**, are not merely instrumental helps but Christ’s appointed conduits of communion. Second, on **new covenant** ethics, some formulations in **2 Corinthians 3** could be heard as heightening discontinuity; a Westminster reading would stress the abiding validity of the **moral law** while celebrating the Spirit’s enabling power. These are adjustments within substantial agreement. Peterson’s enduring gift to Reformed theology is to restate, with exegetical precision, that in the economy of grace belonging precedes behaving, and that the church’s priestly access fuels both gathered worship and dispersed mission under the sovereign **Word**.
