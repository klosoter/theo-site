### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul Helm emerges from the late twentieth-century British analytic milieu as a distinctively **Reformed Augustinian** philosopher-theologian, committed to **classical theism** and the confessional grammar of **Calvin** and the **Westminster Standards**. Trained in philosophy and teaching at the University of Liverpool, and then as Professor of the History and Philosophy of Religion at **King's College London** in the 1990s before later work at **Regent College** in Vancouver, Helm inhabits the intellectual space where careful logic, historical retrieval, and doctrinal construction meet. The Oxford-influenced school of analytic philosophy of religion, shaped by figures like **Basil Mitchell** and later engaging **Alvin Plantinga**, supplied Helm with tools to clarify claims about **divine attributes**. Yet unlike analytic streams prone to revisionism, Helm deploys analysis to recover the metaphysical backbone of **Reformed orthodoxy**: **aseity**, **simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and the **timeless eternity** of God.

The method is both descriptive and argumentative: descriptive in its close readings of **Calvin** and the **Reformed scholastics**, argumentative in its defense of a strong **Augustinian compatibilism** over against **libertarian freedom**, **Molinism**, and **open theism**. Helm treats theological propositions as candidates for conceptual analysis, but always within the ordering horizon of **Scripture** read with **analogia fidei** and the canons of confessional dogmatics. In place of a modernist suspicion of metaphysics, he follows **Aquinas** and **Boethius** in construing biblical teaching about God through an ontology of **pure act** and **simple aseity**. This yields a hermeneutical posture where the grammar of **Creator-creature distinction** and the logic of *ad intra* and *ad extra* operations govern claims about divine action, providence, and incarnation.

Helm's distinctive contribution is the insistence that the Reformed are not beholden to a modern, temporalist picture of God. Against the suggestion that biblical personalism excludes **divine timelessness**, he retrieves **Boethius's** doctrine of eternity and integrates it with **Calvin's** convictions about **God's decree** and **meticulous providence**. In so doing, he models a Reformed analytic approach in which philosophical disputation clarifies theological theses without muting confessional content. The watchwords are **conceptual clarity**, **historical continuity**, and **doctrinal stability**.

#### 2. Eternal God: God without time
Helm's early and defining text, **Eternal God: A Study of God Without Time** 1988, 2nd ed. 2010, offers a full-throated defense of **divine timelessness** and thus of **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **simplicity** as a coherent family of doctrines. He appropriates **Boethius's** definition of eternity as the whole, perfect, simultaneous possession of interminable life, arguing that God does not exist in time either as an **A-series** tensed sequence or a **B-series** tenseless ordering. Against **William Lane Craig's** A-theoretic presentism and proposals of divine time, and against **process theism's** temporal mutability, Helm maintains that temporality is a feature of creatures and of the created order, not of **aseity** itself. The architecture of the argument links **simplicity** to timelessness: if God is without metaphysical parts and without unrealized potential, then intratemporal succession would compromise **immutability** and render **impassibility** unintelligible.

A perennial difficulty is how a timeless God can know tensed facts and act in a temporal world. Helm replies with a tenseless analysis of truth predication and with a doctrine of **eternal decree** coordinating **secondary causes** by **concurrence**. God knows all truths not by accumulating information through successive temporal states but by a single, timeless act that grounds every temporal event. The divine will determines the history of the world in one comprehensive decree, while creaturely actions are real and morally significant through the ordained means. Here the compatibility of **meticulous providence** and **human responsibility** becomes a bridge to Helm's Augustinian moral psychology. He opposes the claim that foreknowledge and freedom are incompatible by denying the premises that require a libertarian account of freedom. Instead, freedom is the power to act according to one's strongest motive or inclination within the patterns ordained by God. The timeless God need not fore-see in a temporal sense, because what is known and willed by God is the complete order of temporal reality *sub specie aeternitatis*.

Philosophical interlocutors such as **Brian Leftow**, **Eleonore Stump**, and **Norman Kretzmann** are treated with respect but often corrected in the direction of a stricter **Boethian** thesis. Helm appreciates their efforts to clarify **eternity** and **simultaneity**, but resists solutions that smuggle in temporal sequence at the level of divine cognition. He also scrutinizes **simple foreknowledge** and **middle knowledge**, arguing that **Molinism** depends on contingent counterfactuals of creaturely freedom that lack a truthmaker under classical **aseity**. The upshot is a Reformed classical theism secure in **immutability** and **timelessness**, yet insistently compatible with meaningful **prayer**, **petition**, and **obedience** as ordained means within the **decree**.

#### 3. Providence, freedom, and moral responsibility
In **The Providence of God** 1993, Helm gathers biblical and philosophical strands to present **providence** as comprehensive, wise, and holy, under the hallmark of **meticulous sovereignty**. He invokes the Reformed triad of **preservation**, **concurrence**, and **governance**, insisting that nothing, from the casting of lots to the decisions of kings, falls outside the counsel of God. Against **open theism** as advocated by **Clark Pinnock**, **John Sanders**, and **William Hasker**, Helm argues that divine uncertainty is a theological wound that lacerates **omniscience**, undermines **trust in promise**, and disintegrates **petitionary prayer**. God's exhaustive knowledge of the future is not a limitation imposed by settled possibilities but an entailment of **aseity** and **omniscience** grounded in the one **eternal decree**.

Moral responsibility, on Helm's account, is secured through **compatibilist freedom**, a position he receives through **Augustine** and **Jonathan Edwards**. The will chooses in line with the agent's nature and strongest motive; responsibility tracks the agent's own reasons-responsive capacities, not an ability to choose otherwise in a libertarian sense. Helm draws on **Edwards's** analysis of causation and moral necessity to argue that Scripture's ascriptions of blame and praise presuppose divine **sovereignty** rather than threaten it. He sharpens the asymmetry the Reformed place between **election** and **reprobation**: while God efficaciously calls and regenerates the elect, he does not infuse evil desires into the reprobate but passes them by, ordaining to permit their sins for just ends. This asymmetry protects divine **holiness** and rejects the charge that the decree makes God the author of sin.

The book also attends to providence's pastoral edges. Helm defends **impassibility** as the perfection securing the reliability of God's covenant love, not an absence of compassion. He treats **prayer** as a divinely appointed means whereby God brings about the very ends he has decreed, refusing both fatalism and open contingency. Here analytic clarity serves to interpret biblical narratives, holding together texts on **God's repentance** and **relentings** with canonical assertions of **immutability** and **truthfulness** without collapsing into anthropomorphism. The net effect is a theologically thick **providence** that is neither deistic nor processual, but rigorously **Augustinian** and **Reformed**.

#### 4. Calvin without caricature: history and retrieval
A major strand of Helm's oeuvre reassesses **Calvin** and the **Reformed scholastics**. In **Calvin and the Calvinists** 1982, he contests the thesis of **R. T. Kendall** and **T. F. Torrance** that a fissure opened between Calvin's evangelical theology of faith and later scholastic preoccupation with **decree**. Helm argues that on matters such as **assurance**, **particular redemption**, and the relation of **union with Christ** to **ordo salutis**, there is substantive continuity between Calvin and the high orthodox. Calvin's own use of **accommodation**, his explicit commitments to **predestination**, and his deployment of **autotheos** in the Son all resonate with later Reformed developments rather than stand in antithesis to them. Against romantic historiographies, Helm restores Calvin to the metaphysical convictions common to the catholic West, including **simplicity** and **impassibility**.

This historical case is deepened in **John Calvin's Ideas** 2004 and **Calvin at the Centre** 2010, where Helm offers a synoptic map of Calvin's conceptual commitments. He treats **Scripture's perspicuity**, **sensus divinitatis**, **accommodation**, **Christ's two states**, **sacramental presence**, and **church polity** with the same conceptual rigor he brings to **eternity**. Crucially, Helm frames Calvin's **autotheos** not as a proto-social trinitarian innovation but as a precision statement of **aseity** with respect to the Son's divine nature *ad intra*, consistent with eternal **generation** and **consubstantiality**. The Son's deity is from himself, as God, while his person is eternally from the Father; the careful distinctions of person and essence, relation and essence, guard against both subordinationism and modalism. Helm thus joins the modern **Reformed scholastic** retrieval, often associated with **Richard Muller**, in rejecting simplistic dichotomies between biblical and metaphysical Calvin.

Helm's historical retrieval also engages debates over **assurance** and **faith**. Against the claim that Calvin offers a robust, immediate assurance severed by later theologians, Helm shows that both Calvin and the orthodox bind assurance to **Word**, **Spirit**, and **sacrament**, with a pastoral realism about temptation and doubt. Similarly, on **atonement**, he resists readings that make Calvin a universalist or hypothetical universalist, arguing that Calvin's logic coheres with **definite atonement** even if his rhetoric sometimes emphasizes the sufficiency of Christ's death. These historical judgments serve Helm's wider program: the modern Reformed need not choose between biblical piety and metaphysical clarity, because the tradition never so chose.

#### 5. Reason, faith, and epistemic responsibility
Alongside metaphysics and historical theology, Helm has worked at the intersection of **epistemology** and **theology**. In **Faith and Understanding** 1997 and in later essays, he probes the rational status of **Christian belief**, engaging **Reformed epistemology** and the analytic debates about **warrant**, **evidence**, and **doxastic responsibility**. Helm is sympathetic to **Plantinga's** externalist thesis that belief in God can be properly basic, grounded in a functioning **sensus divinitatis**, yet he presses for the ongoing need of **theology** to articulate the content of that belief through **Scripture** and tradition. He also resists any anti-evidentialist triumphalism by reaffirming the instrumental role of **arguments**, **apologia**, and the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**.

Within this frame, Helm explores **faith and reason** as interlocking cognitive virtues. The authority of **Scripture** orders rational inquiry by setting the parameters of what counts as faithful reasoning about God and the world, while philosophical analysis clarifies how doctrinal claims hang together. He is wary of a thin fideism that isolates belief from intellectual virtue, as well as of a rationalism that subordinates **revelation** to a foreign canon of plausibility. Thus, he recovers older Protestant themes such as **perspicuity**, **self-authentication** of Scripture, and **accommodation**, while remaining alert to modern hermeneutical questions. The aim is not to escape philosophy but to discipline it, so that confidence in Christ and his Word produces a proportionate confidence in carefully stated doctrine.

Helm's epistemic posture also shapes his ecclesial instincts. He favors confessional stability and the role of **creeds and confessions** as secondary norms. They serve as guardrails for communal rationality, protecting the congregational reception of **simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **providence** from the tides of theological fashion. In this sense, Helm's analytic work is ecclesially productive: it supplies pastors and teachers with logically ordered accounts of deeply traditional commitments.

#### 6. Incarnation, Trinity, and doctrinal coherence
Although not primarily a constructive trinitarian or Christological author, Helm addresses **Trinity** and **incarnation** as they intersect with **simplicity** and **timelessness**. He defends the classic **homoousios** and the procession relations, stressing that **simplicity** secures the unity of divine operations and the indivisible agency of Father, Son, and Spirit. The doctrine of **inseparable operations** follows from simplicity: there are no separate sets of powers in the persons, only the one divine power subsisting in three relations. This allows Helm to resist proposals that infer personal subordination from economic roles, keeping **autotheos** for the Son coordinated with eternal **generation** and the Father's **paternity**.

On the **incarnation**, Helm leans on the two-natures formula to protect genuine human development in Christ while denying any change in the divine nature. The Word assumes a complete human nature in hypostatic union without compromising **immutability** or **impassibility**. The communicatio idiomatum is treated with Chalcedonian care: predications about Christ must be attributed to the person, not to the natures confounded or divided. The result is a Christology that fits snugly within his overarching commitment to **classical theism** and Reformed dogmatics, reinforcing his claim that these older commitments are not philosophical add-ons but the grammar of biblical confession.

#### 7. Time, prayer, and pastoral theology
Helm is aware that **timeless eternity** and **meticulous providence** can seem pastorally remote. His solution is not to dilute the doctrines but to show their pastoral leverage. A God who is **immutable** and **impassible** is unalterably faithful; his covenant does not oscillate with creaturely moods. A God who decrees the ends and the means renders **prayer** potent rather than precarious; petitions are woven into the fabric of providence as ordained instruments by which God effects his will. For Helm, the doctrine of **secondary causes** is the great pastoral bridge: responsibility is not canceled by sovereignty but established, because God's concurrence elevates and sustains creaturely actions. This yields confidence in ordinary means, confidence in **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **obedience**, and confidence that even in suffering, divine wisdom orchestrates for good.

Here Helm also revisits the problem of evil. He adopts the **Augustinian** privation account and emphasizes the asymmetry of God's willing: he efficaciously brings about good, and he permits evil, setting its bounds and directing its outcomes without endorsing its moral deformity. The doctrine of **reprobation** is treated soberly, with emphasis on divine justice and the opacity of the decree to creaturely inspection. The pastoral counsel is to flee to Christ, in whom the decree meets the gospel. This tone matches Helm's larger program: conceptual precision must answer to doxology and discipleship.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates in analytic theology
Helm's work intersects with the flowering of **analytic theology** and contemporary philosophy of religion. He contends with **William Lane Craig** over the metaphysics of time, showing that Craig's postulation of divine time and denial of **timelessness** trades away traditional safeguards of **immutability** and **impassibility**. He evaluates **Stump** and **Kretzmann's** accounts of **eternity**, sometimes adopting their clarifications but rejecting any concession that imports sequence into God. Against **Molinists** like **Thomas Flint**, Helm argues that **middle knowledge** depends on brute contingencies that undermine **aseity** and render divine **providence** reactive. With **Plantinga**, he is friendly yet critical, endorsing **proper basicality** but warning that **Reformed epistemology** must be tethered to robust **dogmatics** lest it drift into mere theistic externalism.

Within Reformed historiography, Helm stands alongside **Richard Muller** in defending the continuity of **Calvin** with later **Reformed scholasticism**. He resists **Torrance's** and **Kendall's** narratives of degeneration, arguing that attention to scholastic distinctions clarifies rather than corrupts evangelical substance. He often writes with economy and sharpness, especially in essays and reviews, and his online presence has continued this polemical charity. The constant theme is that **classical theism**, far from being a speculative overlay, is the doctrinal grammar that makes Christian confession coherent.

Final Reformed/WTS evaluation
Helm's enduring contribution is to demonstrate that **classical theism** and **Augustinian compatibilism** are the native idioms of **Reformed orthodoxy**, and that they can be articulated with analytic clarity and historical fidelity. The strengths are manifest: a rigorous defense of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **timeless eternity**; a coherent account of **providence** and **compatibilist freedom**; a compelling case for the continuity of **Calvin** with the **Reformed orthodox**; and an epistemic posture that honors **Scripture's authority** while employing disciplined reason. Tensions arise where analytic tidiness might seem to minimize the idiom of **covenant** and the asymmetrical, history-embracing shape of **redemptive economy**. Some Reformed theologians, including voices within the **Westminster** tradition, prefer to speak of God's eternity as atemporal without committing to the complete denial of any kind of duration, or they fear that strong **timelessness** and a tenseless theory of truth could abstract biblical discourse. Others would frame **simplicity** more apophatically, emphasizing **Creator-creature distinction** and **archetypal-ectypal** knowledge to avoid over-specification. A constructive alternative within classical Reformed bounds is to hold Helm's metaphysical theses while more explicitly coordinating them with **covenantal condescension**, the organic unity of **history** in **Bavinck's** sense, and the **Van Tillian** emphasis on analogical reasoning. By his own lights, Helm largely achieves this synthesis, and his work remains a reliable guide for confessional theology to think metaphysically without surrendering biblical particularity.
