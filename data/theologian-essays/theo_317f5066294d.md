### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John D. Currid emerges as a contemporary Reformed Old Testament theologian whose project unites **grammatico-historical exegesis** and **Ancient Near Eastern studies** within a confessional doctrine of **Scripture’s inerrancy**. Educated at the **University of Chicago** in the late 1980s amid the dominance of critical **ANE philology** and comparative religion, and formed pastorally and confessionally at **Reformed Theological Seminary**, he learned to read Israel’s texts with both philological precision and covenantal sensibility. His classroom and field experiences in **biblical archaeology** refined a **maximalist historiography** that resists minimalist reconstructions of Israel’s past. The intellectual horizon included the legacies of **Wellhausen’s Documentary Hypothesis**, the ongoing revision of **Pentateuchal source criticism**, and evangelical debates over **hermeneutics and history**, particularly following the so-called Chicago statements on **inerrancy**. Currid’s response was neither retreat into fideism nor capitulation to critical skepticism but the articulation of a **polemical theology** in which the Old Testament confesses **YHWH’s lordship** precisely by subverting the claims of **Egyptian and Mesopotamian deities**.

This context led Currid to a particular methodological blend: the **grammatico-historical method** as the ordinary mode of exegesis, a **canonical-biblical theological** eye trained on covenantal development, and the discipline of **archaeology** as auxiliary to the textual witness. The approach aims to preserve the **Creator-creature distinction** while attending to the real **intertextual frictions** between Israel and its neighbors. For Currid the Old Testament is not innocent of ANE forms or motifs, but its literary dependence is never theological dependence; rather, the patterns are recoded to declare **YHWH’s uniqueness**, a stance that mirrors a **Van Tilian antithesis** between **covenant loyalty** and **idolatry**. His work thus displays a confessional confidence that the biblical text is both historically responsible and theologically polemical.

#### 2. Major works and constructive theses
Currid’s construction can be traced through his major publications. In **Ancient Egypt and the Old Testament** 1997, he argues that the exodus narrative and broader Pentateuchal material reflect a sustained **anti-Egyptian polemic**, wherein the plagues target the pantheon and cultic stability of **Pharaonic ideology**. He reads episodes such as the Nile turning to blood, the darkness, and the death of the firstborn as rhetorical blows against gods like **Hapi**, **Ra**, and **Pharaoh-as-divine-son**, expositing **Exodus** as theological warfare. The argument, while indebted to Egyptological data, is hermeneutical in its aim: the purpose of the text is to magnify **YHWH’s supremacy** through **public judgment** on the gods. This thesis is extended in **A Study Commentary on Exodus** 2000–2001, which complements the polemical reading with the defense of the **early date of the exodus** 1446 BC, identifying the likely pharaonic candidates as **Thutmose III** as the oppressor and **Amenhotep II** as the exodus king. In that commentary Currid underscores the covenantal structure of **sinai-theophany**, **law**, and **tabernacle**, framing Israel’s constitution as a liturgical polity devoted to **divine holiness**.

His commentaries on **Genesis** 2003 give fuller doctrinal scope to creation and primeval history. Currid defends **six ordinary days**, the historicity of **Adam**, and the **global flood**, reading **Genesis 1–11** as deliberately countering ANE cosmogonies through **ex nihilo** creation, the **imago Dei**, and **providence** ordered by divine speech. He is especially concerned to rebut readings that render Genesis 1 as **functional ontology** without material claims. Against **John H. Walton**, Currid insists that the text affirms actual material origination as well as temple imagery, and that the *toledoth* structure advances a historical-providential frame. A related, popular-level synthesis appears in **Against the Gods** 2013, where the theme of **polemical theology** is generalized across the canon: the creation account parodies the **cosmic egg** and **primordial sea** motifs; the **Leviathan** texts demythologize chaos monsters; the **prophets** mock idol manufacture; and **wisdom literature** retools proverbial forms while repudiating **manticism**. The aim here is to instruct pastors and students in a hermeneutic that recognizes cultural contact yet underscores **revelation’s antithetical edge**.

Currid’s work on archaeology further anchors his theological program. **Doing Archaeology in the Land of the Bible** 1999 synthesizes field methods and interpretive prudence, training students to read strata and ceramics without speculative overreach while correlating data with **biblical historiography**. As coeditor of the **ESV Archaeology Study Bible** 2018, he curates notes and essays that set **epigraphic evidence**, **material culture**, and **historical geography** alongside the canonical text. Later, in **The Case for Biblical Archaeology** 2020, he argues that material discoveries, while not proving theology, provide **coherent plausibility structures** for the Bible’s historical claims and resist **minimalist reconstructions** from Iron Age Israel backward. This archaeological agenda supports his maximalism with respect to the **patriarchal narratives**, **exodus-conquest sequence**, and **monarchical history**.

Finally, **Calvin and the Biblical Languages** 2006 articulates a practical and theological vision for **pastoral exegesis**. Currid retrieves **John Calvin’s insistence** that ministers know **Hebrew and Greek** if they would handle the **ipsissima verba** of divine revelation. Here exegesis is a spiritual discipline, and linguistic realism guards the church against both **clerical anti-intellectualism** and **scholarly skepticism**. The programmatic upshot for Currid’s overall corpus is clear: the church needs **linguistically and historically competent readers** who are covenantally bound to **Scripture’s authority**.

#### 3. Doctrinal development and contested fronts
Across these works, several doctrinal through-lines emerge. First is a robust doctrine of **Scripture**. Currid’s insistence on **inerrancy**, **infallibility**, and **self-attestation** anchors his resistance to hermeneutical models that dilute **Mosaic authorship** or fragment the canon. He grants the possibility of minor **editorial glosses** but rejects the evolutionary scaffolding of **Documentary Hypothesis** reconstructions. Second is an account of **creation and providence** that foregrounds **divine speech**, **sabbath sanctification**, and **Adam’s federal headship**. The six-day structure is for him a created rhythm of work and worship, not a mere pedagogical device. Against the claim that Genesis is primarily liturgical or functional, he contends that the text delivers both **ontology** and **teleology**, integrating material origin and temple symbolism under the sovereignty of **YHWH**.

Third, Currid’s exodus theology unites **redemption and revelation**. The **plagues** and **Passover** are not simply national liberation but revelatory acts whereby **YHWH makes his name known among the nations**, a theme that regulates the **Decalogue** and the **tabernacle**. The cultic system is construed as a pedagogy of holiness that culminates in **covenant presence**, anticipating the priestly and prophetic fullness realized in **Christ**. Fourth, his archaeology underwrites a doctrine of **history** in which God’s acts are public, dateable, and culturally situated. This does not collapse **revelation** into archaeology, but it does insist that the church should expect **coherence** between text and world, given the unity of **truth**.

These doctrinal emphases sharpen Currid’s debates with contemporaries. Against **Peter Enns’s accommodation model**, which suggests the Old Testament participates in ANE mythic discourse in a way that relativizes historicity, Currid replies with **polemical inversion**: Israel’s Scripture enters the arena precisely to contradict the gods and myths of the nations. Against **John Walton’s functional creation** thesis, he maintains that material origin and cosmic temple themes are both present, an instance of **both-and** rather than **either-or**, with the Creator’s *fiat* speech as the efficient cause. Against **minimalism** in archaeology represented by figures like **Israel Finkelstein**, he argues for the **plausibility of the biblical timeline**, not by harmonistic force but by cumulative correlation. In each case, the doctrinal stake is the integrity of **revelation as word-and-deed**, where **special revelation** interprets the historical record and calls for covenantal trust.

#### 4. Intertext, ANE, and the architecture of polemic
Currid’s signature contribution is the category of **polemical theology** applied systematically to the Old Testament. He refuses both naive isolationism and syncretistic assimilation. Instead he proposes that biblical authors, aware of the **cultural scripts** and myths around them, intentionally borrow forms and motifs to execute **theological reversals**. Examples include the demotion of **sun, moon, and stars** to mere lights in **Genesis 1**, the subjugation of **sea and serpent** imagery in **Exodus 14** and **Psalm 74**, and prophetic satires of **idol manufacture** in **Isaiah 40–48**. Even **wisdom literature**, while sharing affinities with Egyptian and Mesopotamian instruction, reconfigures the moral order around **the fear of YHWH**. Currid thus reads the canon as a sustained controversy in which **YHWH’s lordship** is declared against **the gods** and their cultures.

The hermeneutical payoff is twofold. First, **comparative study** is not a threat but a servant to theological clarity; the closer the parallels, the brighter the contrast. Second, polemic protects the **Creator-creature distinction**. If ANE myths threaten to collapse deity into nature, Israel’s Scriptures deny **emanation** and insist upon **creation ex nihilo**. If ANE kingship tends toward the **divinization of the sovereign**, Israel enthrones **YHWH alone** and subjects the king to **Torah**. If fate governs in pagan cosmologies, **providence** and covenant promise structure history for Israel. In this way **polemical theology** functions as an apologetic without becoming a mere defense; it is integral to the text’s own doxological aim.

Currid knows the risks of over-reading parallels and therefore argues for **textual control**. In **Against the Gods** 2013 he cautions that similarity does not entail dependence, and dependence does not entail identity of meaning. He commends a criterion of **subversion** rather than **syncretism**, asking whether a shared form is used to dismantle rival claims. This is particularly evident in his treatment of **the plagues**, where the rhetoric targets specific domains of Egyptian divine authority, and in his reading of **flood traditions**, where **Noah’s narrative** distinguishes covenant grace from **capricious pantheons**. The method thus disciplines comparative work with theological aim and textual specificity.

#### 5. Scripture, canon, and pastoral exegesis
A practical dimension runs through Currid’s publications: the retrieval of **pastoral exegesis** that is philologically serious and ecclesially accountable. In **Calvin and the Biblical Languages** 2006, he argues that confessional Protestantism stands or falls with the **original languages**, urging ministers to pursue lifelong facility in **Hebrew and Greek**. This retrieval is not antiquarian; it is an ecclesial strategy to secure sermons and catechesis rooted in **Scripture’s verbal plenary inspiration**. Currid’s commentaries, especially on **Genesis** and **Exodus**, model **text-driven homiletics** that move from lexical observation to theological synthesis and pastoral application. The point is clear: the doctrine of **Scripture** must be embodied in the labor of reading, and biblical theology must finally serve the church’s **worship and obedience**.

This pastoral telos shapes his canon sensibility. Currid reads **Torah, Prophets, and Writings** as a unified **covenantal witness** climaxing in **Christ**, without flattening the text into proof-texts or dissolving it into thematic generalities. His alignment with **Reformed biblical theology** emphasizes promise and fulfillment, type and antitype, law and gospel, all under the sovereignty of **covenant grace**. The Old Testament’s **polemical edge** therefore prepares for the New Testament’s proclamation that **Christ disarms the powers** and unveils the idolatry of the nations. Currid’s insistence on historical referentiality remains intact, even as he reads the canon as a single drama of **redemptive history**.

#### 6. Archaeology, history, and the plausibility of Scripture
Currid’s archaeology is disciplined by two principles: the **priority of the text** in theological claims and the **instrumental utility** of material culture for historical plausibility. In **Doing Archaeology in the Land of the Bible** 1999 he introduces stratigraphy, pottery typology, and site interpretation, warning against both sensationalism and cynicism. As editor of the **ESV Archaeology Study Bible** 2018, he fosters a public pedagogy in which inscriptions, geography, and ancient lifeways inform reading. In **The Case for Biblical Archaeology** 2020 he contends that while archaeology rarely yields demonstration, it often yields **underdetermination that is text-friendly**. The cumulative weight of settlement patterns, inscriptions, and cultic installations supports the broad **narrative arc** of Israel’s emergence, exodus-conquest trajectory, and monarchy.

In this register Currid stresses that **divine acts in history** are public and therefore in principle **correlatable**. This guards against a false dichotomy between **faith** and **history**. Yet he also insists that **revelation interprets history**, not vice versa. Material evidence can correct misreadings and refine chronology, but theological meaning is given by **God’s speech**. The two affirmations keep faith and scholarship in fruitful tension: material culture is the stage, **revelation** is the script, and **covenant history** is the play.

#### 7. Interlocutors and intramural disputes
Currid’s interlocutors range across critical and evangelical spectra. He opposes **Documentary Hypothesis** revisions that undermine **Mosaic authorship of the Pentateuch**, arguing for literary unity with allowance for minor redactional touches. He engages **Peter Enns** by refusing an incarnation-analogy that normalizes myth and error in Scripture; for Currid, *accommodatio* never yields **untruth**, only **pastoral condescension** of form. He challenges **John Walton** on the ontological status of Genesis’s creative acts, welcoming temple imagery but insisting on **material origin**. He stands close to **Kenneth A. Kitchen** and **James K. Hoffmeier** in treating the **exodus** as historically anchored and in dating it to the fifteenth century BC. In debates over **archaeological minimalism**, he contests **Israel Finkelstein** and similar reconstructions that compress Israel’s emergence into a late Iron Age development.

Within Reformed circles, Currid enters intramural dialogue over **Genesis days** and hermeneutics. He argues for **six ordinary days**, opposing **analogical day** or **framework** proposals associated with **Meredith G. Kline** or later advocates. He maintains that textual markers and sabbath theology favor ordinary days tied to **creational rhythm**. His readings emphasize **historical particularity** alongside typology, guarding against flattening the text into pure symbol. On ANE parallels he insists that the dominical principle is **antithetical polemic**, though he also acknowledges the richness of **common grace** in cultural forms. The debates are cordial yet substantive, reflecting core Reformed concerns about **revelation, nature, and grace**.

#### 8. Contribution and synthesis
The enduring contribution of Currid’s scholarship is the coordinated deployment of **polemical theology**, **maximalist historical reasoning**, and **confessional exegesis**. By demonstrating how **Israel’s Scriptures** engage and invert **ANE myth and cult**, he provides pastors and scholars with a tool to navigate similarities without theological compromise. By integrating **archaeology** at the level of plausibility and context, he strengthens the church’s confidence in **public truth**. By retrieving **Calvin’s linguistic rigor**, he links doctrine of **Scripture** to pastoral practice. The synthesis is not novel in its individual parts, but its coherent packaging for the contemporary church is distinctive: a model of how to be **anciently informed, canonically tethered, and confessionally bold**.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Currid’s strengths align closely with classic **Reformed orthodoxy**: the **self-authenticating Word**, **Creator-creature distinction**, **covenant history**, and a Van Til-ting **antithesis** that frames **polemical theology**. His defense of **Mosaic authorship**, **inerrancy**, and **historical referentiality** serves the church admirably. Tensions arise at two points. First, his pervasive use of **polemical readings** risks becoming the dominant lens, at times overdetermining texts where the canonical authorial aim may be more priestly-cultic or sapiential than adversarial; a Vosian **biblical theology** would counsel calibrating polemic within broader **covenant epochs** rather than making it the controlling grammar. Second, his firm commitment to **six ordinary days** and an **early exodus date**, though exegetically argued, is not the only confessional option. Within the same Reformed commitments, **analogical day** or **framework** readings and a **thirteenth-century exodus** proposal have been defended on textual and archaeological grounds by other confessional scholars. A WTS-shaped alternative would commend maintaining Currid’s **anti-syncretism** and **maximalist historiography**, while allowing greater elasticity on **chronology** and **creation days** under the regulative control of **Scripture’s clarity** and **catholic Reformed consensus**. Even with these cautions, the net effect of Currid’s corpus is salutary: he equips the church to read the Old Testament as a public, historical, and theologically antithetical witness to **YHWH’s exclusive lordship**.
