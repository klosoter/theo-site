### TITLE
Stephen Coleman offers a warmly ecclesial, historically rooted, and confessionally bounded account of the Christian life that fruitfully integrates **Puritan spirituality** with **Reformed pastoral theology** while raising questions about method and the scope of **systematic theology**.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Contemporary **Stephen Coleman** works in a late modern, post-1960s evangelical and Reformed setting shaped by the rediscovery of **Puritanism** and debates over **piety** and **practice** in confessional churches.
- As a Westminster **practical theology** and **Systematic Theology** contributor, he stands within the legacy of **Van Til** and **Vos**, yet self-consciously addresses a generation formed by American **evangelicalism** and postmodern **individualism**.

- Methodologically, Coleman works as a pastor-theologian whose epistemic stance prioritizes **Scripture** in its redemptive-historical and covenantal form, read within the confessional **Reformed tradition** and applied to the life of the church.
- He tends to treat theology as essentially **ecclesial** and **practical**, insisting that knowledge of God is oriented to worship and **holiness**, not to speculative construction or detached academic **systematics**.
- In his method there is a strong retrieval of **Puritan** habits of soul examination and covenantal self-knowledge, yet consistently governed by **Westminster Standards** and classical **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- In work on **piety** and sanctification, such as essays on **assurance** and Puritan **experiential Calvinism**, Coleman argues that Reformed orthodoxy has always linked doctrinal precision with heart religion and the means of grace.
- In his teaching on **church leadership** and pastoral ministry, he expounds a theology of **eldership** and **shepherding** that draws from **Acts 20** and **1 Peter 5**, stressing ordinary means of grace and biblical qualifications.
- In his contributions to preaching and **homiletics**, he emphasizes **Christ-centered**, text-driven exposition shaped by redemptive history, yet sensitive to the affections and spiritual condition of hearers.
- In his broader reflection on **Christian ethics** and cultural life, Coleman stresses ordinary, vocation-shaped faithfulness, resisting culture-war triumphalism while also rejecting pietistic **withdrawal**.

- Coleman is especially important for loci of **sanctification** and assurance, since he integrates **union with Christ**, the means of grace, and the Puritan tradition of spiritual self-examination.
- He also significantly addresses **ecclesiology** and the office of elder, insisting that Christ rules his church through ordained **officers**, Word, sacrament, and discipline.
- His work impinges on **Scripture and hermeneutics**, since he aligns with a **redemptive-historical** and Christocentric reading that resists moralistic preaching while still pressing specific **application**.
- In **practical theology** he labors to hold together doctrinal fidelity, historical rootedness, and pastoral usefulness in a way continuous with **Westminster** and **Reformed scholastic** instincts.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to present Coleman as a positive example of **confessional Reformed piety** and pastoral method, not as a speculative innovator in **dogmatics**.
- The committee will also expect you to show how his use of **Puritan** sources and focus on **experience** remain subordinate to **Scripture**, avoiding both mysticism and therapeutic evangelical **subjectivism**.

- For comparison, you should be ready to contrast Coleman with **Schleiermacher** on the role of religious **experience** and with **Barth** on the churchly location of theology and the nature of **preaching**.
- You should also compare his retrieval of **Puritan piety** and assurance with **Calvin** and the **Westminster Confession**, and if pressed, distinguish his pastoral method from the more speculative **systematics** of **Bavinck**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Stephen Coleman is a contemporary **Reformed** theologian and pastor, teaching in the orbit of **Westminster Theological Seminary** in the early twenty-first century, and deeply shaped by the rediscovery of early modern **Puritanism** within conservative Presbyterian circles. He stands downstream of the recovery of **Reformed orthodoxy** by figures like **J. I. Packer** and the work at Westminster by **Harvie Conn**, **Edmund Clowney**, **Richard Gaffin**, and **Sinclair Ferguson**, all of whom insisted that doctrine and doxology belong together. Coleman ministers and writes in a late modern context marked by fragmentation of the church, evangelical anti-intellectualism, and a deep spiritual hunger often met by therapeutic or consumerist forms of religion rather than by robust confessional **Christianity**.

The driving problem in Colemans work is how to cultivate genuinely **Reformed piety** and ecclesial life in a distracted, experience-saturated age without collapsing into either introspective legalism or doctrinal formalism. He perceives that modern evangelicals have often severed **systematic theology** from the ordinary life of the church, so that doctrine is either a hobby for specialists or a set of slogans, while **sanctification** and pastoral care are outsourced to pop psychology. At the same time, he knows that a shallow appeal to experience can function as a substitute **authority** in place of Scripture and confessional standards. His theology therefore aims to retrieve historic **Puritan** and Reformed patterns of spirituality in which the **Word**, sacraments, and prayer shape the believers affections, assurance, and obedience, while keeping those patterns under the governance of the **Westminster Confession** and a high view of the institutional church.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Coleman operates with a classically Reformed conviction that **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi of theology, the ruling principle of our knowledge of God, while reason, experience, and history function ministerially and not magisterially. He drinks deeply from the **Westminster Standards**, which describe Scripture as the sufficient, clear, and authoritative rule of faith and life, and he reads the Bible in a redemptive-historical and covenantal way influenced by **Vos** and **Gaffin**. For Coleman, the primary context in which revelation is received is the gathered **church**, where the Triune God addresses his people through the public reading and preaching of the Word, the administration of the sacraments, and corporate prayer. This gives his method an ecclesial and liturgical texture, distinct from both rationalist **scholasticism** severed from worship and from modern academic theology detached from the church.

In regard to reason and experience, Coleman follows a **Van Tillian** instinct: human **reason** is covenantal and dependent, never neutral, and must be subordinated to Gods self-attesting revelation in Christ and Scripture. Yet he also insists, in line with **Puritan experiential Calvinism**, that the believer truly knows God by the Spirit through a transformed experience of the heart. He resists both Enlightenment rationalism and postmodern subjectivism, asserting that Christian **experience** is derivative, Spirit-wrought, and normed by Scripture, not a freestanding authority alongside it. Historically he mines **Puritan** and Reformed sources, treating the churchs tradition as a subordinate standard and a school of wisdom, never as an equal authority with Scripture, but as a tested interpretation of Scripture in specific conflicts and pastoral circumstances.

A notable feature of Colemans method is his integration of **systematic theology**, biblical exegesis, and pastoral theology. He does not treat systematics as a speculative construction built on abstract philosophical principles, but as a disciplined effort to confess what **Scripture** teaches, for the sake of preaching, counseling, and congregational life. This is consonant with the older **Reformed scholastic** understanding of theology as *doctrina Deo vivendi*, teaching about God for living to God. Yet the possible tension, from a Westminster perspective, is that by emphasizing the practical and pastoral telos of theology, later readers might mistake him as reducing theology to practical concerns and underplaying the architectonic function of dogmatic **loci** such as Trinity and Christology. A careful exam answer should note that his actual practice maintains the primacy of classical doctrines while aiming them relentlessly at the sanctification and comfort of the saints.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **sanctification and assurance**, Coleman works explicitly within the confessional baseline of the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, which teaches that those effectually called and united to Christ are further sanctified in a real though imperfect way, and that assurance is of the essence of faith in one sense, yet may be diverse and assailed in another. Coleman retrieves **Puritan** accounts of sanctification that place **union with Christ** at the center and that interpret growth in holiness as a Spirit-driven, Word-saturated, and church-mediated process. In his treatments of assurance, he follows the classic triad of the **promises of God**, the internal testimony of the **Spirit**, and the evidences of grace, and he intentionally counters both Keswick-style perfectionism and modern evangelical doubts about the legitimacy of self-examination. His interlocutors include more therapeutic readings of the Christian life in contemporary **evangelicalism**, and he sides instead with the likes of **Thomas Goodwin** and **John Owen** in insisting that genuine assurance is compatible with a profound sense of indwelling sin, yet it is grounded not in introspection but in Christ and his covenant promises.

Second, in the locus of **ecclesiology and pastoral office**, Coleman stands on the confessional claim that Christ, as head and king of the church, governs his people by his Word and Spirit through ordained **officers** and the ordinary means of grace. He develops a theology of eldership and pastoral ministry that emphasizes biblical qualifications in **1 Timothy 3**, **Titus 1**, and **1 Peter 5**, and he resists contemporary attempts to professionalize ministry according to secular management models. In teaching on church leadership and shepherding, Coleman stresses that elders are called to guard doctrine, oversee worship and discipline, and care for souls through the Word, which requires deep acquaintance with **systematic theology** and historic Reformed doctrine. An implicit dialogue partner is the church-growth movement influenced by **Willow Creek** and entrepreneurial evangelical models, and he deliberately presses the Reformed alternative of a Word-governed, elder-led **presbyterian** polity in which spiritual oversight rather than market metrics defines faithfulness.

Third, regarding **Scripture, preaching, and hermeneutics**, Coleman is firmly rooted in the Reformed confessional account of **revelation**, which affirms Scripture as the inspired, inerrant, and sufficient Word of God. In his teaching on preaching and exegesis he aligns with the **redemptive-historical** movement from **Vos** and **Clowney**, insisting that Christ is the center of Scripture, and that preaching must proclaim the person and work of Christ from all of Scripture, not merely offer moral exhortations. At the same time, Coleman is keenly aware of the risk of a merely formal Christocentrism that fails to press specific, concrete **application** on the conscience. His homiletical contribution is to keep together robust exegesis, redemptive-historical sensitivity, and **Puritan** concern for the affections and conscience of hearers. His interlocutors include both moralistic preaching that ignores redemptive history and certain forms of redemptive-historical preaching that minimize direct address, and he argues that faithful preaching must be doctrinal, Christ-centered, and pastorally searching.

Fourth, in the area of **Christian ethics and culture**, Coleman applies a Reformed doctrine of vocation and the **Lordship of Christ** to modern questions of cultural engagement. The confessional baseline here is the Reformed affirmation that Christ is king over every sphere of life, that believers are called to live as pilgrims in the world, and that the **moral law** remains a rule of gratitude. Coleman discourages both culture-war triumphalism and separatist pietism, calling instead for ordinary faithfulness in family, work, and civic life, grounded in the Decalogue and expounded through wise pastoral application. He pushes back against therapeutic identity politics in broader **culture** and in the church, urging Christians to see their primary identity in union with Christ and membership in the covenant community. His conversation partners include both transformationalist **neo-Calvinism** when it becomes triumphalist and quietist forms of fundamentalism, and he labors to retrieve a sober, pilgrim-minded ethic reminiscent of **Calvin** and the **Puritans**.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Coleman deliberately aligns himself with the stream of **Reformed orthodoxy** represented by **Calvin**, the **Westminster divines**, **Turretin**, and more recently by **Bavinck** and **Vos**, especially in his insistence that doctrine and piety must never be divorced. In his approach to sanctification and assurance, he echoes **Calvin**s duplex gratia, the double grace of justification and sanctification in **union with Christ**, and he integrates the triadic grounds of assurance in a way that resonates with the **Westminster Confession** and the best of **Puritan** experiential theology. In ecclesiology he follows **Turretin** and classic Reformed polity in treating eldership and presbyterian governance as Christ instituted means of shepherding and guarding the flock. In his hermeneutics and homiletics he extends the line from **Vos** and **Clowney**, affirming the unity of Scripture and its Christological center, yet always in service to the preaching ministry and the cure of souls.

At several points, however, a Westminster examiner must be alert to potential overstatements in reception. First, if Colemans emphasis on experience and piety is misunderstood, it might be taken as endorsing a quasi-**Pietist** method in which internal states become the primary criterion of theological truth. The Reformed candidate must insist that for Coleman, as for **Van Til**, experience is covenantally interpreted and normed by the self-attesting **Scripture**, never the other way around. Second, by stressing the pastoral and practical telos of theology, there is a risk that readers might downgrade the independent importance of dogmatic loci such as **Trinity** and **Christology**, as though they are valuable only insofar as they yield direct application. A Westminster answer should note that classical Reformed scholastics, like **Bavinck**, held together contemplation of God for its own sake and its necessary fruit in piety, and that Coleman is best read as retrieving that integration, not as collapsing theology into pastoral technique.

At the same time, there are clear areas where Reformed theologians can learn from Colemans work. His retrieval of **Puritan** spiritual wisdom can correct a modern Reformed tendency toward cold confessionalism that treats the **Westminster Standards** as merely boundary markers rather than as a guide to lived communion with God. And his insistence that preaching be both redemptive-historical and experientially searching can sharpen Reformed homiletics that sometimes falls into either abstract doctrinal lectures or shapeless narrative exposition. Overall, his reception within confessional Presbyterian circles has been positive, as a contemporary example of the **pastor-theologian** who keeps together the older Reformed commitment to orthodoxy, ordered worship, and experimental religion.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, the safest way to begin speaking about Stephen Coleman is to say that he is a contemporary **Reformed pastor-theologian** who exemplifies the **Westminster** conviction that true theology is both doctrinally precise and experientially fruitful in the life of the church. That opening sentence underlines his confessional commitments, his pastoral orientation, and his continuity with the Reformed tradition, and it will immediately signal to the committee that you are not treating him as a speculative innovator on the level of **Barth** or **Schleiermacher**. Another safe line is to say that Coleman retrieves **Puritan** experiential Calvinism in a way that is rigorously subordinated to Scripture and the **confessions**, thereby resisting both evangelical subjectivism and bare intellectualism.

There are several phrases you should avoid or carefully qualify. Do not describe Coleman as adopting a **Pietist** or experience-first method, since that would suggest a **Schleiermacher**-like move where religious feeling becomes the source of doctrine. If you speak of his emphasis on **experience** or heart religion, immediately tether it to the **Spirit** applying Scripture in the church through Word and sacrament. Likewise, do not say that he deconstructs or relativizes classical **dogmatics**; instead, say that he insists that dogmatics is ordered to the churchs worship and sanctification. Avoid language that suggests he is a culture-war theologian or a quietist; if you address his ethics, emphasize his balanced **Reformed** pilgrim ethic of ordinary vocation and obedience under Christs kingship.

A typical misunderstanding students have about Coleman is to assume that because he is located in practical or pastoral theology, he is somehow methodologically looser than historical **Reformed scholastics**. An examiner may press you here, asking whether his appeal to experience undermines **Sola Scriptura**. You should respond that he follows the classic Reformed threefold use of experience: as the sphere in which the Spirit applies the Word, as a confirmatory evidence of grace under Scripture, and as a pastoral datum to be interpreted by the **Word**, not as a coequal source of revelation. Another misunderstanding is to flatten his redemptive-historical homiletics into a kind of Christocentric moralism. If pressed, you should say that in continuity with **Vos**, Coleman treats the Bible first as a history of special revelation focused on **Christ**, and only then as a moral guide, and that his moral application flows from union with Christ and the indicatives of the gospel, rather than as free-floating exhortation.

An examiner might also explore whether Colemans focus on eldership and local church shepherding risks parochialism, as if serious theology is confined to the consistory room. Here you should clarify that he stands with **Calvin** and **Bavinck** in seeing the local church as the primary theater of Gods saving work and of theological reception, yet he understands that theology as catholic and world-embracing, not as a narrow sectarian project. Finally, a landmine would be to treat Coleman as if he were a major architect of new Reformed dogma; it is better to present him as a significant contemporary witness to the living use of classical **Reformed orthodoxy** in preaching, piety, and church life.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Stephen Coleman is to be affirmed as a contemporary **Reformed** theologian who faithfully embodies **confessional** commitments in the sphere of piety, preaching, and pastoral ministry, retrieving **Puritan** experiential wisdom and redemptive-historical exegesis in a way that strengthens rather than weakens classical orthodoxy; we must deny any reading of his emphasis on experience or pastoral application that would allow **experience** to function as an independent norm alongside Scripture, or that would reduce **systematic theology** to pragmatic technique, and we should insist instead that, in continuity with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck**, contemplation of the Triune God in his saving works possesses its own intrinsic worth while necessarily bearing fruit in holiness and ecclesial faithfulness; if asked where I land, I would say that Colemans integration of doctrine, piety, and pastoral practice represents a salutary model of how the **Westminster Standards** ought to be lived and preached today, provided we jealously guard the primacy of Scripture and the central dogmatic loci of **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **union with Christ** as the governing framework for all experiential and practical theology.
