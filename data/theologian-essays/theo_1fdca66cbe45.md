### TITLE
Evolutionary creation as providence: Denis Alexander’s critical-realist integration of biology and evangelical doctrine

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century British evangelicalism**, Cambridge-based laboratory science, and the post-Darwin culture wars form the historical frame of **Denis Alexander** and the **Faraday Institute for Science and Religion**.
- Method marked by **critical realism**, **two-books** epistemology of **general revelation** and **special revelation**, and multilayered **divine action through secondary causes** rather than interventionist gaps.
- Key works: **Rebuilding the Matrix** (2001), **Creation or Evolution: Do We Have to Choose?** (2008; rev. ed. 2014), **Rescuing Darwin** with **Nick Spencer** (2009), **Genes, Determinism and God** (2017), **Is There Purpose in Biology?** (2018).
- Central categories: **evolutionary creation** or **theistic evolution**, **Homo divinus** model for **Adam and Eve**, **imago Dei** as moral-relational capacity, **federal headship** without genetic bottleneck, **teleonomy vs teleology**, **multi-level causation** against **genetic determinism**.
- Interlocutors and influences: dialogue and critique of **Richard Dawkins**, **Stephen Jay Gould**, **Intelligent Design** theorists; affinities with **John Polkinghorne** and **Alister McGrath**; retrieval of **Augustine** on **accommodatio** and **Aquinas** on **secondary causes**.
- Reformed reception cue: strong resonance with **providence and concursus**, but pressure points regarding **special creation of Adam**, **original sin and imputation**, **Scripture’s clarity**, and **anthropological dualism** in classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and **Westminster standards**.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and intellectual posture
The life-work of **Denis Alexander** unfolds at the intersection of modern laboratory science and **evangelical theology**, with Cambridge institutions providing both scientific and ecclesial gravitas. Trained in **molecular biology** and **immunology**, and later serving as founding Director of the **Faraday Institute for Science and Religion** at **St Edmund’s College, Cambridge** in 2006, Alexander inhabits the late-modern setting in which **Darwinian evolution**, **genomics**, and broader secular narratives contest Christian accounts of **creation**, **providence**, and **human uniqueness**. His editorship of the journal **Science and Christian Belief** and his global laboratory appointments locate him in the hybrid space where **empirical method** and **dogmatic confession** must be negotiated. Theologically, he is an evangelical Anglican voice committed to **biblical authority**, yet he adapts **Augustine’s accommodatio** and leans into **Aquinas’s secondary causation**, integrating **scientific realism** with an **ecclesial reading** of Scripture. The public polemical scene of **Dawkins-style scientism**, **Gould’s NOMA**, and the rise of **Intelligent Design** sharpened his program: he rejects conflict and separation alike, insisting that **critical realism** permits a coherent account of **two books** under one **providence**.

#### 2. Method: critical realism, two books, and divine action
Alexander’s method is governed by **critical realism**: reality is mind-independent, yet human knowing is partial, corrigible, and theory-laden. Within this horizon he articulates a **two-books** epistemology, where the **book of nature** read by the sciences and the **book of Scripture** read by the church speak truthfully in their proper idioms under the **Lordship of Christ**. He explicitly resists both **scientism** that would colonize theology and **fideism** that would sequester doctrine from empirical learning. The lynchpin is a doctrine of **providence and concursus**: God’s **primary causality** grounds and operates through **secondary causes**, so that evolutionary processes, including genuine stochasticity, are encompassed within **divine wisdom**. Alexander argues that no additional **causal joint** between God and the world is needed; the very **laws, constraints, and contingencies** that characterize biology are modes of **God’s governance**. Randomness signals creaturely freedom within ordered systems, not metaphysical indeterminacy beyond the scope of **providence**. This multi-level causation yields his consistent critique of **reductionism** in favor of explanatory pluralism: genes, organisms, populations, and ecological niches offer distinct, non-competing descriptions compatible with **theological teleology**.

#### 3. Rebuilding the Matrix: the Christian soil of science
In **Rebuilding the Matrix** (2001), Alexander constructs a historical-apologetic case that modern science grew within the **Judeo-Christian matrix** of a rational, contingent, and orderly creation sustained by a faithful **Creator**. He challenges **post-Enlightenment** myths of autonomous reason by revisiting the symbiosis of **doctrine of creation**, **imago Dei**, and the moral-spiritual motivations that animated early modern natural philosophers. The book targets **scientism** and moral relativism, recommending **critical realism** as the common philosophical ground where empirical method and theological confession can cohabit. Here Alexander appropriates **Calvin’s sensus divinitatis** as a moral-epistemic backdrop for scientific trust while distinguishing it from a full **natural theology** that would claim salvific sufficiency. He also retrieves **Augustinian** and **Aquinas**-inflected accounts of **secondary causes**, arguing that nature’s intelligibility encourages scientific vocation without collapsing **Creator-creature distinction**. The work’s thesis is cultural and theological: a Christian ontology of **creation and providence** underwrites and corrects scientific practice, while the sciences supply the church with refined descriptions of the **book of nature**.

#### 4. Creation or Evolution: evolutionary creation and biblical interpretation
With **Creation or Evolution: Do We Have to Choose?** (2008, rev. 2014), Alexander offers his most programmatic case for **evolutionary creation**, arguing that robust **common ancestry**, population genetics, and paleobiology should not be construed as threats to **biblical authority**. He deploys a hermeneutic that honors the **ancient Near Eastern** setting of **Genesis 1–3**, reads **Genesis 1** as doxological cosmology rather than scientific sequence, and discerns historical particularity in **Genesis 2–3** tied to the origin of human sin. Central is his **Homo divinus** model: at a particular stage in hominin history, God established a real pair, **Adam and Eve**, within a wider population, conferring unique **imago Dei** vocation and entering into covenantal relation. On this view **federal headship** and **original sin** are historically grounded, yet no universal genetic bottleneck is posited. Animal death and predation long before Homo sapiens are interpreted as features of a dynamic, good creation, while **Romans 5** is read as attributing human spiritual death to Adam’s trespass rather than teaching universal biological death as postlapsarian innovation. The revised edition addresses developments in **population genetics** and strengthens the exegetical-theological framing of **imputation** and **corporate solidarity**.

#### 5. Adam, sin, and the shape of providence
Alexander’s **Homo divinus** proposal aims to preserve the theological architecture of **covenant, fall, and redemption** within an evolutionary history. He contends that the **imago Dei** is best construed as the God-given capacity and calling for worship, moral responsiveness, and relationality, not a discrete biological trait. In this frame, **original sin** concerns the spread of disobedience through **headship** and enculturation rather than through genetic inheritance. While he resists **Gould’s** sharp separation of magisteria, he is equally critical of linking doctrinal claims to refuted scientific hypotheses, urging that **federal theology** is metaphysical-moral rather than genetic. Alexander has welcomed conversations about **genealogical Adam** proposals that show how a recent universal ancestry could overlay deep population structures, although his own emphasis remains on covenantal-historical headship rather than de novo **special creation** of the first pair. Natural evil and the so-called costliness of creation are interpreted within a broader **Augustinian** frame in which a world ordered by **law-like regularities** and open-ended processes is the fitting theater for **creaturely freedom**, anticipating the **Christocentric** healing of creation.

#### 6. Genes, Determinism and God: freedom, responsibility, and nonreductionism
In **Genes, Determinism and God** (2017), Alexander prosecutes a sustained case against **genetic determinism** and the crude sociobiological claims associated with **Dawkins** or sweeping neuroscientific determinists. He marshals contemporary molecular biology, **epigenetics**, developmental systems theory, and population genetics to show that gene expression is context-sensitive, multi-directional, and embedded in organism-environment loops. Human behavior, on this account, cannot be reduced to single-gene explanations; explanatory power tracks **multi-level causation** and complex systems. Theologically, the implications favor a robust account of **moral responsibility**, consonant with biblical teaching on sin and judgment, and with an **imago Dei** that includes representational and moral agency. Alexander affirms **nonreductive physicalism** as a best current account of human constitution, insisting that mental states are emergent and causally efficacious without violating physical regularities. This position aims to maintain responsibility without invoking occasionalist divine action, thereby deepening his earlier appeal to **concursus** and secondary causes. The book’s polemic is thus both scientific and theological: determinism is empirically inadequate and theologically corrosive, undermining the grammar of **covenant**, command, and faith.

#### 7. Is There Purpose in Biology?: teleonomy, finality, and providence
In **Is There Purpose in Biology?** (2018), Alexander interrogates the oft-repeated claim that biology knows no **teleology**, only blind processes. He distinguishes **teleonomy** at the level of biological function and design-like features from meta-level **teleology** rooted in **creation and providence**. Evolutionary pathways exhibit constrained novelty, channeling variation through **physical law** and developmental architectures; this constraint-coincidence pattern sits naturally within a theistic narrative of **final causes**. Yet Alexander resists triumphalist progressivism: evolutionary history is not a steady ascent but a branching process that sometimes yields rational beings capable of knowing God. The reality of suffering, predation, and extinction is treated as the natural costliness of a world fit for complex life, given divine intent to create a theater of **love and freedom**. Here he retrieves a cruciform motif, arguing that the **God of love** who creates a law-like world also redeems it in **Christ**, promising consummation. The upshot is a chastened, theologically thick account of purpose: biologically, purposes are functions and selected effects; theologically, purposes are embedded in **providence**, disclosed in **Scripture**, and climax in **eschatology**.

#### 8. Public theology and interlocutors: beyond conflict and gaps
Alexander’s public posture navigates between the twin errors of **conflict** and **compartmentalization**. In the pamphlet **Rescuing Darwin** (2009, with **Nick Spencer**), he argues that evolution does not entail atheism, challenging **New Atheism**’s cultural authority while warning Christians against facile rejections of well-attested science. He is a sustained critic of **Intelligent Design** at the level of strategy and theology, judging it to lean on **God-of-the-gaps** reasoning and to risk conflating **methodological criticism** of evolutionary mechanisms with metaphysical conclusions about **agency**. His positive alternative is a thick **providence** that uses secondary causes without anxiety, echoing **Aquinas** and **Polkinghorne**. Interdisciplinary dialogue marks his audiences and influences: the Faraday Institute convenes philosophers, theologians, and scientists to reform discourse around **creation**, **human uniqueness**, and **ethics**. Alexander engages **Gould**’s **NOMA** to expose its inadequacy, pushing instead for a **critical realist** common ground where Scripture’s claims about the world and science’s claims about its processes can be adjudicated without mutual excommunication.

#### 9. Doctrinal threads: Scripture, creation, humanity, and sin
Doctrinally, Alexander holds to the **authority of Scripture** and reads **Genesis** with attention to **ANE** idioms and canonical development. His doctrine of **creation** emphasizes continuous **providence and concursus** rather than episodic interruptions, with **randomness** situated under the decree as creaturely contingency. His anthropology is a nonreductive **imago Dei** account: humans are covenantal worshipers whose rational, moral, and relational capacities constitute their vocation. He affirms a historical **fall**, **federal headship**, and **original sin**, but redeploys them to fit deep hominin time and population structures, rejecting a **genetic** model of sin-transmission in favor of **covenantal-solidarity**. On **natural evil** he advances an **Augustinian** reading that protects divine goodness by locating the world’s costliness in the gift of law-like, fruitful processes that are nevertheless ordered to **eschatological** healing. Throughout, Alexander aligns with **Aquinas** on secondary causes, appreciates **Calvin’s accommodatio**, and retrieves **Warfield** as an evangelical precedent for nuanced openness to **evolutionary creation** under the sovereignty of God.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS**-shaped vantage point, Alexander’s strengths are considerable: a robust **providence and concursus** that refuses deism or occasionalism; a disciplined **two-books** posture that rejects **scientism**; a defense of **moral responsibility** against **genetic determinism**; and a constructive effort to preserve **federal headship** and a historical **fall**. Yet fault lines remain. First, on **creation and anthropology**, the **Westminster Confession of Faith 4.2** teaches the immediate and special creation of humanity; Alexander’s **Homo divinus** model, which embeds Adam and Eve within an evolved population, strains that confessional specificity even if a **genealogical Adam** could be layered in. Second, on **Scripture and method**, his heavy reliance on **ANE** background and current science in reading **Genesis 1–3** risks moving scientific models from ministerial to quasi-magisterial use, where textual claims about the order, miracle, or historicity of events could be thinned by extra-textual considerations rather than adjudicated by **analogia fidei**. Third, on **original sin and imputation**, relocating transmission dynamics from Adamic generation to culture and covenant may inadvertently attenuate the forensic dimension of **imputation** and the gravity of inherited corruption guarded by **Reformed orthodoxy**. Fourth, on **anthropology**, Alexander’s **nonreductive physicalism** sits uneasily with the classical **body-soul** distinction favored in Reformed scholasticism, where **immaterial soul** language secures personal identity across death and underwrites a robust eschatology. Reformed alternatives would include: retaining a ministerial science posture while affirming **special creation** of Adam and Eve; anchoring **original sin** in both **federal representation** and a mysteriously real propagation from Adam as humanity’s root; and receiving evolutionary accounts of providential processes without revising creational and anthropological loci confessed in **Westminster Standards**. Even so, Alexander’s careful appeal to **concursus**, his rejection of **ID** gaps in favor of thick **providence**, and his anti-determinist defense of moral agency mark him as a significant ally on key doctrines, even as confessional Reformed theology will press him on **creation**, **anthropology**, and **Scripture’s principium**.
