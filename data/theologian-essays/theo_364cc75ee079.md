### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Graham A. Cole is a contemporary **evangelical Anglican** whose theological voice was forged within the distinctive **Australian evangelical** ecosystem and then amplified in the North American **evangelical academy**. Educated and early formed in the **Moore Theological College** tradition, Cole absorbed a rigorous commitment to **grammatical-historical exegesis**, the **unity of Scripture**, and the program of **biblical theology** flowing from **creation, fall, redemption, new creation**. His decades of teaching in Australia, especially at **Ridley College, Melbourne**, matured into transcontinental leadership when he joined **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School** in 2011 and served as **Dean** from 2013 to 2019. This move brought his work squarely into debates over **atonement**, **pneumatology**, and **method** among **evangelicals** wrestling with secularization and pluralism. Cole’s intellectual mentors include **J. I. Packer** on **evangelical catholicity**, **Leon Morris** on **atonement**, and **D. A. Carson** on **biblical theology**, alongside a deep retrieval of **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and **Calvin**.

Cole’s method is marked by a Scripture-first posture that honors **sola Scriptura** without adopting a biblicist naivete, using the **regula fidei** to shape doctrinal judgment while maintaining the **analogia fidei** as hermeneutical ballast. He insists that **systematic theology** must be tethered to the canon’s theodramatic plot and that dogmatic synthesis should not be a speculative metaphysic but what he calls theology for **doxology** and **mission**. The result is an integrative method that takes **exegesis** and **biblical theology** as its springboard, draws on **historical theology** for guardrails, and aims at contemporary **pastoral-practical** wisdom. His theological grammar leans on **Trinitarian ontology**, **inseparable operations**, and a carefully stated **filioque**, with a teleology of **shalom** that frames salvation as restorative peacemaking in Christ.

Cole writes out of a late twentieth-century context in which **evangelicalism** sought catholic depth against both **liberal historicism** and **fundamentalist reductionism**. Against the backdrop of arguments over **inerrancy**, **atonement plurality**, and **charismatic renewal**, he advances a calm, canonical proposal. Theological claims must be exegetically warranted, he argues, but must also speak in the church’s **confessional** idiom. His prose is deliberately lucid, serving **catechesis** and **homiletics**, yet it is conceptually weighty: he engages **Karl Barth** on the **Trinity**, **Jürgen Moltmann** on the **Spirit of life**, and **Clark Pinnock** on **openness** and **pneumatology**, while retaining classical commitments such as **divine simplicity** and a chastened **impassibility**.

#### 2. He Who Gives Life and evangelical pneumatology
Cole’s major dogmatic contribution begins with **He Who Gives Life: The Doctrine of the Holy Spirit** (2007), a full-scale **pneumatology** in the Foundations of Evangelical Theology series. The book proceeds canonically, attending to the **Spirit** in **creation**, the **Spirit** in **Israel’s life**, the **Spirit** in the **ministry of Jesus**, and the **Spirit** in the **apostolic witness**, before drawing systematic conclusions. He argues for the **personhood** and **deity** of the Spirit with exegetical care, insisting that the Spirit’s operations are **inseparable** from those of the **Father** and **Son** *ad extra*, even as the Spirit possesses a hypostatic profile marked by missions that reveal his **procession**. Cole defends a Western **filioque** as a faithful gloss of the biblical economy, yet he counsels irenic phrasing that recognizes the East’s concern to protect the **monarchy of the Father**.

The constructive core of Cole’s pneumatology lies in mapping the Spirit’s agency across the full economy of God. In **creation**, the **Spirit** both vivifies and orders, safeguarding the good of **nature**. In **revelation**, the **Spirit** inspires Scripture and illumines the church, effecting **faith** through the **Word** and enabling the **analogia fidei**. In **Christology**, he highlights a robust **pneumatological Christology**, tracing the **anointing of Jesus**, the **Spirit’s role** in the **incarnation**, and the **resurrection** as a climactic **Spirit-of-Holiness** act. In **soteriology**, Cole expounds **union with Christ** as the encompassing gift mediated by the **Spirit**, unfolding **regeneration**, **justification**, and **sanctification** as Spirit-wrought participations in the Son’s saving benefits.

Cole enters contested terrain on **charismata**, **guidance**, and **spiritual warfare** by distinguishing the centrality of the **Spirit’s sanctifying and missionizing presence** from debates over the **sign gifts**. His posture has been described as **open but cautious**, affirming that the **New Testament** does not teach a hard **cessationism**, while warning against constructing an expectation of normative **apostolic phenomena** detached from the church’s **Word-sacrament** life. He interacts appreciatively yet critically with **Gordon Fee** and **Max Turner** on **Pauline pneumatology**, with **James D. G. Dunn** on **Spirit-baptism**, and with **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** scholarship more broadly. Throughout, his retrieval of **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and **Owen** situates contemporary practice within **classical Trinitarian** and **Reformed** insights about the Spirit’s ministries.

#### 3. Atonement as shalom and the kaleidoscopic cross
In **God the Peacemaker: How Atonement Brings Shalom** (2009), Cole addresses the modern fracturing of **atonement doctrine**, particularly in the wake of public critiques of **penal substitution** within British evangelicalism. Drawing on **Leon Morris**, **J. I. Packer**, and the canon’s legal-cultic and royal-prophetic idioms, he argues that Scripture’s rich metaphors coalesce around the reality that God in **Christ** makes **peace** by the **blood** of the cross, restoring **shalom**. The controlling claim is not that one model displaces the others but that **penal substitution** functions architectonically within a **kaleidoscopic** nexus that includes **Christus Victor**, **expiation-propitiation**, **reconciliation**, and **moral transformation**.

Cole’s canonical approach tracks atonement lines from **Leviticus** to **Isaiah 53** and through the **Gospels** and **Paul**, resisting revisionist reductions. He answers **N. T. Wright’s** kingdom emphasis by insisting that **forgiveness of sins** and **justification** are not merely byproducts of the kingdom but constitutive of the gospel’s **peace-making**. He defends the righteousness of divine judgment against charges of **cosmic child abuse**, clarifying **divine impassibility** as moral steadfastness rather than emotional stasis and underscoring **Trinitarian** agency: the **Father** sends the **Son**, the **Son** offers himself through the **eternal Spirit**, and God’s holiness and love meet in the cross. The teleology of **shalom** permits him to integrate **personal salvation** and **cosmic renewal**, tying the cross to **new creation** without conceding ground on the forensic heart of **justification**.

Cole does not neglect the ecclesial and sacramental horizon. Atonement yields a reconciled **church**, called to embody **peace** through **forgiveness** and **mission** in a violent world. He pushes back against secularized ethics that treat **peacemaking** as merely humanitarian, contending that the church’s **eucharistic** and **baptismal** practices are enacted signs of reconciliation. The result is an **evangelical** doctrine of the cross shaded by the whole counsel of God, ordered to **doxology**.

#### 4. Incarnation, angelology, and a re-enchanted creation
With **The God Who Became Human: A Biblical Theology of Incarnation** (2013), Cole again leverages canonical method to secure the **incarnation** as the climactic act in the triune economy. He traces anticipations of divine presence and agency through the **Angel of the Lord**, **Wisdom**, and **Immanuel** motifs, arguing that the **New Testament** identifies Jesus as the enfleshment of Israel’s God without collapsing Creator and creature. The work culminates in concise dogmatics: the **homoousios** of the Son, the two natures in the **hypostatic union**, and the **communicatio idiomatum** are expounded in service of preaching Christ. Cole engages **Athanasius** and **Chalcedon**, rebuts **Arian** and **Socinian** tendencies, and rejects **kenotic** Christologies that jeopardize **immutability** and **impassibility** even as he grants the reality of Christ’s **kenosis** as the assumption of servanthood, not a divestment of deity.

Cole’s work on the **incarnation** is pastoral and missional: God’s descent secures not only **atonement** but also the paradigm for **mission** and **holiness**. He highlights the **Spirit’s** role in the son’s mission, reinforcing a **pneumatological Christology**. The emphasis on **theosis** is restrained and reformed: participation in God is by **union with Christ** through the **Spirit**, never an ontological absorption but a filial adoptive share in the Son’s life. Here again, the governing telos is **shalom**, the restoration of fellowship with God that anticipates **new creation**.

In **Against the Darkness: The Doctrine of Angels, Satan, and Demons** (2019), Cole answers the modern loss of the **invisible world** by providing a careful **angelology** within the doctrine of **creation** and **providence**. Angels are ministering spirits who serve God’s reign; **Satan** and **demons** are real, personal agents of opposition. Cole corrects sensationalism by rooting **spiritual warfare** in the ordinary means of grace while acknowledging the need for discernment, intercession, and the church’s confidence in **Christus Victor**. He converses with **C. S. Lewis** on a sane supernaturalism, challenges **Walter Wink’s** reduction of powers to socio-political structures, and once more exhibits canonical reserve combined with dogmatic clarity. The world is **re-enchanted** in an evangelical key that refuses both credulity and skepticism.

Cole’s concise primer, **Faithful Theology: An Introduction to Systematic Theology** (2020), distills his method and aims. He frames **dogmatics** as answering five basic questions about **God**, **creation**, **sin**, **Christ**, **salvation**, and **church**, always under the norm of **Scripture** and the guidance of the **creeds** and **confessions**. He presents theology as the **church’s** act of faithful understanding for **worship** and **mission**, returning to the refrain that right doctrine serves **doxology**. The volume models his preference for canonical synthesis, historical retrieval, and pastoral application.

#### 5. Methodological threads and interlocutions
Across his corpus, Cole demonstrates a consistent theological grammar marked by **Trinitarian** confidence, **canonical** patience, and **pastoral** intent. He deploys **inseparable operations** to safeguard the unity of divine action while preserving hypostatic distinctness through **missions** that reveal **processions**. He defends **divine simplicity** and a nuanced **impassibility**, resisting process and open theist revisions while allowing the biblical language of God’s **affections** to function analogically. He reads the canon through a **biblical-theological** lens while refusing to collapse dogmatics into narrative alone, thus keeping doctrinal propositions in service of **preaching** and **catechesis**.

Cole’s interlocutors range from the **Fathers** to contemporary biblical and systematic theologians. With **Gordon Fee** and **Max Turner**, he considers how **Pauline pneumatology** situates the **Spirit** in the economy of salvation; with **James D. G. Dunn**, he contests reconstruals of **Spirit-baptism** detached from **union with Christ**. He receives **Karl Barth**’s insistence on the priority of God’s **self-revelation** while countering Barth’s reluctance about **natural theology** with an affirmation of **general revelation** grounded in **Romans 1**. He appreciates **Jürgen Moltmann**’s attention to the **Spirit of life** and **new creation** yet rejects any speculative **trinitarian process** that would compromise **aseity**. Against **Clark Pinnock** and openness theologians, Cole argues that the **triune God** is sovereign, omniscient, and faithful in covenant, upholding classical **providence**.

At the same time, Cole is thoroughly **evangelical** in tone, regularly citing **Packer**, **Stott**, and **Morris** for conceptual clarity on **atonement**, **holiness**, and **Scripture**. His engagement with **N. T. Wright** is appreciative on **kingdom** and **new creation** but insistent that **justification** and **penal substitution** are essential to the gospel’s grammar of **peace**. He retrieves **Calvin** and **Owen** on the **Spirit** and **sanctification**, and he nods to **Jonathan Edwards** on the **Spirit** as the bond of love, though he stops short of speculative trinitarian psychology. This dialogical style illustrates his **evangelical catholicity**, a readiness to learn across traditions while testing all claims by **Scripture**.

#### 6. Theology for doxology and mission
A persistent motif in Cole is that theology must end in **doxology** and flow into **mission**. He frames doctrines of **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **atonement** as the grammar of praise and the charter for **evangelism** and **holiness**. In **He Who Gives Life**, the Spirit’s person and work are not abstract loci but the living reality that empowers **preaching**, **sacramental** life, **prayer**, and **sentness** into the world. In **God the Peacemaker**, the cross is not merely an individual soteriological solution but God’s **cosmic peacemaking** that calls the church to embody **reconciliation**. In **The God Who Became Human**, the **incarnation** is the missionary logic of divine descent, the pattern of **humility** and **service** in the power of the **Spirit**.

Cole’s pastoral instinct appears in practical treatments of **guidance**, **assurance**, and **spiritual discernment** in **Engaging with the Holy Spirit**. He tackles questions such as how to recognize the **Spirit’s voice**, how to evaluate **impressions**, and how to pursue **holiness** in ordinary vocation. His balance is characteristically canonical and cautious: the **Word** rules, the **Spirit** illumines, and the ordinary disciplines of the **church** are God’s appointed instruments of formation. Even his foray into **angelology** and **demonology** aims at wise pastoral practice that neither sensationalizes nor trivializes the **powers**.

#### 7. Doctrinal development and systematic coherence
Cole’s doctrinal development exhibits coherence across loci. His **Trinitarianism** underwrites his **pneumatology**, his **Christology**, and his **soteriology**, with **inseparable operations** ensuring coordination across the economy. The **filioque** functions not as a Western shibboleth but as a hermeneutical key for reading the **missions** in Scripture. His **atonement** theology is anchored in the forensic core of **penal substitution**, yet he refuses to truncate the biblical witness by treating other motifs as optional. His doctrine of **sanctification** is Reformed, centered on **union with Christ** and the **Spirit’s** progressive work, with due attention to **mortification** and **vivification**. His **ecclesiology** is free-church friendly yet retains **Anglican** instincts about the church’s public worship and ordered ministry, with the **creeds** and **confessions** as pedagogical tools.

Importantly, his theological vision is integrative in an explicitly canonical way. He repeatedly shows how **Genesis** and **Revelation**, **Leviticus** and **Hebrews**, **Isaiah** and **Romans**, form the tectonic plates under Christian doctrine. The outcome is a **systematics** that reads like sustained exegesis and a **biblical theology** that lands in doctrinal clarity. Cole’s proposals are thus serviceable for **preachers**, **catechists**, and **academics** alike, a rare triangulation in contemporary **evangelical** theology.

#### 8. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** standpoint, much in Cole’s work commends itself. His uncompromising commitment to **sola Scriptura**, his defense of **Trinitarian** orthodoxy with **inseparable operations**, his robust affirmation of **penal substitution** at the center of atonement, and his emphasis on **union with Christ** resonate strongly with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. His canonical method harmonizes with **Geerhardus Vos’s** biblical theology and with a covenantal reading of **redemptive history**, even when he does not foreground covenant as his primary macro-structure. His doxological teleology of **shalom** aligns with Reformed attention to **gloria Dei** and **new creation**.

Two areas invite principled discussion. First, Cole’s **open but cautious** approach to **charismata** differs from classic **cessationism** associated with the **Westminster Confession**’s sense of the cessation of extraordinary revelatory gifts. He mitigates this tension by subordinating experiences to **Scripture** and embedding practice in the church’s ordinary means, yet Westminster readers will press for a clearer confessional boundary. Second, his nuanced account of **divine impassibility** and affective language is friendly to recent classical retrievals but will provoke questions about precision: Westminster divinity emphasizes God’s **immutability** and **impassibility** without qualification, whereas Cole, following **Aquinas** and **Reformed scholastics**, reframes impassibility as the perfection of divine love’s constancy, not apathy. On **covenant theology**, one might wish for a more explicit deployment of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** as the canonical superstructure for his shalom motif, which could sharpen law-gospel relations and sacramental ecclesiology in a Westminster frame. These are family conversations rather than fault lines. On balance, Cole’s canonical dogmatics offer Reformed readers a constructive ally who strengthens confessional commitments to **revelation**, **atonement**, and **Trinity**, while inviting careful debate about **gifts**, **impassibility**, and the organizing role of **covenant**.
