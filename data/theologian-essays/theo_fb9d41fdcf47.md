### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
James J. Cassidy emerges as a contemporary **Reformed pastor-theologian** whose work inhabits the ecclesial and academic networks of the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** and **Westminster Theological Seminary**. His formation unfolds within a late modern American landscape where **Barthian actualism**, **analytic revisions of classical theism**, and evangelical biblicism converge and conflict. Against this backdrop, Cassidy aligns with the **Reformed Forum** project, active since 2008, which cultivates retrieval of **Herman Bavinck** and **Geerhardus Vos** alongside a renewed appreciation for **Reformed scholastic** precision. The controlling motif of Cassidy's theology is the **Creator-creature distinction** articulated through **Van Tilian** principia and the **archetypal-ectypal** model. That model sets the order for theological knowing: God in his **archetypal knowledge** knows himself comprehensively, while creatures receive **ectypal knowledge** by divine **covenantal condescension**, a pattern that secures both epistemic humility and dogmatic confidence in the **self-authenticating Scripture**.

Cassidy's method draws explicit boundaries using **Van Til's antithesis** between belief and unbelief while avoiding an anti-intellectual posture. His constructive impulse employs the classic **analogia fidei** rather than a metaphysical **analogia entis**, but he does so with careful attention to metaphysics as ordered by dogmatics. The result is a principled **revelational epistemology** that refuses autonomous reason yet positively appropriates the **scholastic distinctions** of **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. Cassidy's ecclesial vocation as an OPC minister disciplines his academic voice: doctrine is for preaching and catechesis, the **ordinary means of grace**, and the formation of confessional churches, not merely for scholarly exchange. That pastoral anchor gives his critiques of **Barth** and modern theology a measured urgency, since at stake are the Trinity, Christology, covenant, and the church's proclamation.

#### 2. The Barth project: time, eternity, and actuality
The focal point of Cassidy's published academic work is the monograph **God's Time For Us: Barth on the Reconciliation of Eternity and History (2016)**. There he undertakes a sympathetic yet exacting reading of **Karl Barth**, especially the Church Dogmatics on **God's eternity**, **God's time**, and the **history of Jesus Christ**. Barth speaks of God as the Lord of time who has his own time, with the incarnation as the decisive event wherein eternity and time are reconciled, inflecting eternity with a Christological shape. Cassidy registers the force of Barth's protest against timeless deism and emergent historicism, but he diagnoses a deeper shift in Barth's ontology toward **actualism**, where God is what he does, and election in **Jesus Christ** becomes definitive of divine identity. For Cassidy, the Barthian idiom risks collapsing **aseity** into history, even as it disavows classical **divine simplicity** and **immutability**.

To assess this shift, Cassidy retrieves **Boethius's definition** of eternity as the simultaneously whole and perfect possession of interminable life, as received in **Thomas Aquinas** and reconfigured by **Reformed scholastics** such as **Francis Turretin** and **Amandus Polanus**. On this account, **divine timelessness** names God's mode of life *ad intra*, while the biblical economy unfolds *ad extra* by **covenantal condescension** without alteration in God. Cassidy argues that this classical grammar, mediated by **Bavinck**, protects the **Creator-creature distinction** and sustains the **extra Calvinisticum**, the confession that the eternal Son remains beyond the flesh even in the hypostatic union. He then reads **Barth** as attempting to safeguard God's lordship and grace but ultimately revising these doctrines by positing a divine temporality grounded in the history of Jesus. The outcome, Cassidy contends, is a theological short circuit: **metaphysics** is not suspended by revelation but normed and rearticulated by **revelation**, and the classically Reformed distinction between God's **archetypal** knowledge and our **ectypal** reception is indispensable to avoid reifying history into deity.

Cassidy's sustained analysis of **Bruce McCormack's** interpretation of **Barth** strengthens his case. If actualistic ontology reads God as constituted by the act of election, then the doctrines of **immutability** and **impassibility** must be refitted to dynamic patterns that render divine life intrinsically historical. Cassidy resists this trajectory, insisting that the Reformed way forward is not to evacuate **history** but to affirm a robust economy grounded in the **pactum salutis** and the **covenant of grace**, where **redemptive-historical** progression is real without ontologizing history into God. The safeguard is a careful deployment of **inseparable operations** and a clear delineation of the **ad intra** and **ad extra** works of the Trinity.

#### 3. Christology, covenant, and redemptive history
Cassidy's Barth study opens into a broader constructive portfolio in which **Christology**, **covenant theology**, and **redemptive-historical hermeneutics** interlock. Christologically, he foregrounds **anhypostasia/enhypostasia** to maintain that the human nature of Christ has no independent hypostasis but subsists in the eternal person of the Son. Along with **Calvin's autotheos** and the **extra Calvinisticum**, this secures the transcendence of the Son while honoring the true humanity of Jesus. Such grammar, Cassidy argues, checks **Barth's** tendency to make the history of Jesus an index of divine being, by insisting that deity is not expanded by the incarnation, nor humanity divinized, but that the one person acts according to both natures, a point safeguarded by **Chalcedonian** conciliar boundaries and Reformed scholastic precision.

Covenantally, Cassidy advocates the classical pair of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, a scheme he reads through **Vos** and **Kline** as intrinsically eschatological. The **covenant of works** in Adam is not legalistic Pelagianism but the ordained pathway to eschatological life that Christ, as second Adam, fulfills. The **covenant of grace** administers that eschatological gift in history through promises, types, and sacraments, climaxing in Christ's priestly work. Barth's distaste for a prelapsarian **covenant of works** thus reflects, in Cassidy's judgment, a broader reluctance to receive Scripture's law-gospel structuring and to honor federal headship. Cassidy underscores that this covenantal ordering deepens the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**, clarifies **union with Christ** as the fountain of benefits, and orders the **ordo salutis** within the **historia salutis**.

Here **redemptive-historical hermeneutics** functions as a bridge. Cassidy, following **Vos**, reads Scripture as an organically unfolding revelation whose typological architecture is God-given. The **temple** motif, **Sabbath** rest, and the **land** promise are not mere moral tales but eschatological signs fulfilled in Christ and his church. This hermeneutic rejects **Biblicist** proof-texting and **Barthian** flattening of typology into existential encounter. Instead, it confesses a covenantal unity of Scripture that preserves discrete administrations and upholds the **means of grace** as covenantal instruments. The pastoral upshot is a preaching regimen centered on Christ in all of Scripture, ordered by **law and gospel**, and attentive to the church's pilgrimage status between the ages.

#### 4. Epistemology and apologetic posture
At the level of prolegomena, Cassidy's commitments reflect a confident **Van Tilian** stance, refined by historical-theological retrieval. The **self-authenticating Scripture** is the principium externum, and the **Spirit's internal testimony** is the principium internum. This entails a **presuppositional** apologetic that denies neutrality and insists on the **circularity** of ultimate authority while differentiating between vicious and virtuous circularity. Cassidy tempers this with the **scholastic doctrine of principia**, which allows theological reasoning to be rigorous without granting autonomy to reason. Reality is covenantally structured, so natural revelation is not uncreated light but the created theatre of God's glory, readable truly yet suppressible in sin, and requiring **special revelation** for redemptive knowledge. Cassidy thus resists both **rationalism** and **fideism**, and he warns that concessions to an independent **natural theology** often reinstall the very **analogia entis** that the Reformed rejected as compromising the **Creator-creature distinction**.

Nevertheless, Cassidy is not allergic to metaphysics. He positively retrieves **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as catholic and Reformed doctrines, defended exegetically and dogmatically. In conversation with contemporary classic-theist retrievals, he contends that metaphysical grammar must be chastened and governed by Scripture's covenantal narrative. The safeguard is the **archetypal-ectypal** distinction: theological names of God signify truly but not comprehensively. In this light, Cassidy disputes proposals that modify **impassibility** into passibility or that adopt **temporalism** to bridge God and world. The pastoral conviction undergirding this stance is that stable doxology depends on stable doctrines of God, and that **liturgical** and **sacramental** fidelity follows dogmatic clarity.

#### 5. Ecclesial practice, catechesis, and media
Cassidy's setting within the **OPC** shapes his practical theology. He emphasizes **confessional subscription** to the **Westminster Standards** and the centrality of the **ordinary means of grace**. His pastoral writings commend robust **catechesis**, classical **Sabbath** piety, and simple, Word-centered **worship** that conforms to the **regulative principle**. These commitments are not incidental but flow from his doctrinal architecture: the God who is simple and impassible speaks covenantally by Word and sacrament, and the people who live between the times are sustained by those means. Cassidy's ecclesiology thus resists **pragmatic evangelicalism** and **consumerist** liturgies as tacitly at odds with **Reformed catholicity**.

The **Reformed Forum** platform amplifies this pastoral-intellectual project. Through podcasts, seminars, and essays from 2009 to 2024, Cassidy helps curate a school of retrieval that unites **Bavinckian** dogmatics, **Vossian** biblical theology, and **Klinean** covenantal insights. The result is a living conversation that situates **Barth** and modern theology within a larger rehearsal of Reformed identity. This digital pedagogy is significant: the mediation of theological discourse by online media refracts method and audience, and Cassidy has leveraged it to form pastors and lay readers in the grammar of **classical Reformed theism**.

#### 6. Doctrinal integrations: Trinity, Scripture, and history
Cassidy's integration is most visible where **Trinitarian theology**, **bibliology**, and **history** are intertwined. He articulates **inseparable operations** of the Trinity to clarify that the missions of the Son and Spirit reveal the eternal processions without collapsing them. This secures the unity of the divine will and underwrites a **Christocentric** yet **Trinitarian** reading of Scripture. The doctrine of Scripture itself is not a detached prolegomenon but the canonical form of God's **covenant** address. Scripture is a **covenantal document**, inspired and inerrant, that defines the church's speech and structures its sacramental life. History, then, is not a metaphysical substrate but the arena of **redemptive-historical** action, governed by **eschatology** from the beginning. In such a frame, Cassidy contends, **Barth's** claim that revelation is act rather than deposit is too stark. Revelation is both act and deposit: the triune God acts and speaks, and the inscripturated Word is a fitting and sufficient mode of covenant address.

This integration yields a hermeneutic in which **typology** and **promise-fulfillment** patterns are canonically discerned. The church reads from **creation to consummation** under Christ's headship. Cassidy links this to the formative category of **sabbath eschatology** common in **Vos** and **Kline**, where the seventh day anticipates the eschaton. Such themes gather dogmatic and exegetical strands and provide a stable alternative to **Barthian** actualism by locating divine action within covenantal arrangements that do not modify God's **simple** being. Cassidy holds that this resolves the pressure that many modern theologies feel to render God temporal in order to guarantee divine involvement with history.

#### 7. Ethics and the two-kingdoms question
While ethics is not Cassidy's primary publication stream, his covenantal ontology yields a recognizable **Reformed moral theology**. The **moral law** as summarily comprehended in the **Decalogue** abides, with the **Sabbath** command receiving creational and redemptive grounding. Civil and ceremonial laws are read in their typological and temporary functions within the **covenant of grace** administration. On the relation of church and world, Cassidy's proximity to **Klinean** trajectories invites a measured **two-kingdoms** sensibility that distinguishes the cultic kingdom of Christ administered by Word and sacrament from the common kingdom in providence. He resists both ecclesial overreach into cultural dominionism and privatized pietism, arguing instead for pilgrim holiness ordered by the **means of grace** and faithful vocation.

This ethical posture connects to a pastoral habitus. Catechizing households, guarding the **Lord's Day**, and forming consciences by the law-gospel dialectic are not mere applications but the covenantal embodiment of doctrine. Cassidy observes that departures from **classical theism** and **confessional** boundaries often cash out in liturgical experimentation and ethical confusion. His counsel remains steady: preach Christ, administer the sacraments, discipline in love, and wait for the city to come.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and constructive tensions
Cassidy's polemical and constructive work takes shape against key voices. With **Van Til**, he presses the antithesis against **Barth** yet engages Barth carefully enough to avoid caricature. With **Bavinck**, he embraces catholicity and the organic motif of revelation, insisting on doctrinal retrieval rather than repristination. With **Vos** and **Kline**, he reads history eschatologically and covenantally. Alongside these influences, Cassidy converses with contemporary defenders of **classical theism** such as **James Dolezal** and interpretive historians like **Richard Muller**. He agrees that **simplicity** and **immutability** are non-negotiable but frames their reception within a covenantal scripturalism that averts speculative excess.

Debate gathers around his reading of **Barth**. Some Barth scholars, informed by **McCormack** or **Webster**, will claim that Cassidy underestimates Barth's insistence on divine freedom or misreads Barth's talk of "God's time" as a metaphysical thesis rather than a Christological safeguard. Cassidy counters that the exegetical and dogmatic consequences of Barth's actualism remain the same in practice: an unstable doctrine of **immutability**, a reticence about the **covenant of works**, and a revisionist account of **election**. Likewise, advocates of a rehabilitated **natural theology** may object to Cassidy's presuppositional guardrails. He responds by admitting a principled place for **natural revelation** and **theistic proofs** subordinated to Scripture's principia, but he refuses any **analogia entis** that would place God and creatures on a shared ontological scale.

#### 9. A single integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Cassidy's contribution is salutary: he stabilizes prolegomena by reaffirming **Van Tilian** principia, fortifies **classical theism** through **Reformed scholastic** retrieval, and corrects **Barthian** actualism with a covenantal ontology grounded in **archetypal-ectypal** theology. The strengths are plain: a thick **Creator-creature distinction** that protects the doctrines of **simplicity**, **immutability**, and the **extra Calvinisticum**; a coherent **covenant theology** that orders law and gospel, **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**; and a pastoral program centered on **ordinary means**, **confessional** discipline, and **redemptive-historical** preaching. Potential tensions include the need to state with full clarity how divine **timelessness** relates to robust biblical depictions of God acting in time *ad extra*, lest rhetoric of timelessness be heard as static rather than as confessing God's plenitude of life. Further, while Cassidy carefully subordinates metaphysics to dogmatics, his Van Tilian suspicion of **natural theology** can be nuancingly calibrated so as to appropriate a ministerial use of metaphysics in the mode of **Bavinck** and **Turretin**, without conceding an **analogia entis**. Finally, in invoking **Vos** and **Kline**, Cassidy should continue to clarify how eschatology structures covenant without occluding catholic commitments to **nature-grace** integrity under providence. Even with these cautions, the overall judgment is strongly positive: Cassidy models a **confessional** retrieval that is catholic, Trinitarian, and covenantal, offering a coherent alternative to modern revisionisms while nurturing the church's life before the face of the triune God.
