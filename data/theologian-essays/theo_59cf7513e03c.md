### ESSAY
Hubert L. Dreyfus emerged as a decisive twentieth-century voice insisting that human understanding is grounded in **embodied skill** and **background practices**, not in detached **mental representations**. Born in 1929 and teaching at MIT and then the University of California, Berkeley from 1968 until his death in 2017, **Dreyfus** stood at the crossroads of **phenomenology**, the rising **cognitive sciences**, and the cultural authority of **technological modernity**. His early formation combined analytic rigor with existential insight, drawing on **Martin Heidegger**’s *Seinsfrage*, **Maurice Merleau-Ponty**’s account of **motor intentionality**, and **Ludwig Wittgenstein**’s **forms of life**. Against the mid-century confidence of **AI pioneers** and representationalist epistemologies, he insisted that the world shows up through **world-disclosing practices** that are socially shared, historically sedimented, and affectively charged. This fundamental thesis set the trajectory for his engagement with **Heidegger’s being-in-the-world**, his critique of **GOFAI** or Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence, and his late reflections on **nihilism** and **technology**.

Methodologically, **Dreyfus** deployed a descriptive **phenomenology of everyday coping** that granted primacy to **ready-to-hand** involvement rather than to **present-at-hand** theorizing. For him, human agents are first and foremost agents-in-a-world, attuned by **moods**, solicited by **affordances**, and guided by **practical holism** rather than by explicit rules. The key claim of **anti-representationalism** is that intelligent action does not depend on internal models of the external world but on **absorbed coping** within a shared **background**. His reading of **Wittgenstein** on rule following reinforced this point: rules presuppose **forms of life** that already imbue situations with sense. His appropriation of **Merleau-Ponty** showed how **embodied intentionality** and **motor skills** present us with a world of solicitations before reflective awareness. And his exposition of **Heidegger** clarified how practices disclose a **totality of involvements**, where equipment, aims, and communal norms hang together in an intelligible whole. This method made **Dreyfus** both a critic of epistemic foundationalism and a champion of **practical know-how**.

The polemical focal point of this method was **What Computers Can’t Do** in 1972, later expanded as **What Computers Still Can’t Do** in 1992. Confronting the optimism of **Herbert Simon**, **Allen Newell**, and **Marvin Minsky**, **Dreyfus** argued that **symbolic AI** cannot capture **common-sense know-how** because it lacks access to the **background** of shared practices. He highlighted the **frame problem**, the challenge of determining relevant information in open-ended contexts, and the **symbol-grounding problem**, the inability of symbols to acquire meaning absent already meaningful worldly contact. He diagnosed the **combinatorial explosion** that results when rule-based systems attempt to enumerate context variables. While conceding that specialized domains like chess might yield to brute-force computation, he insisted that general intelligence depends on **situated, embodied skill**, not on formal representations. His critique remains germane in the era of **machine learning** and **large language models**, which display statistical prowess yet still rely on humanly curated **backgrounds** and struggle with the **mooded attunement** and **norm-governed responsiveness** that enliven ordinary life.

In **Mind Over Machine** in 1986, coauthored with Stuart Dreyfus, he developed the influential **Dreyfus model of skill acquisition**, articulating five stages from **novice** through **advanced beginner**, **competent**, **proficient**, to **expert**. The model describes a trajectory from detached **rule-following** to **intuitive, context-sensitive coping**, where the expert responds to **solicitations** without explicit deliberation. This account of **expertise** offered a normative picture of human excellence consonant with **Aristotelian phronesis**, practical wisdom cultivated in **traditions** and **communities of practice**. It scaled across domains, from piloting and medicine to athletics and pedagogy, and in theological terms it resonated with the craft-like formation required for **pastoral ministry**, **liturgical leadership**, and **virtue ethics**. The core insight remained stable: truly intelligent action is not a matter of applying abstract rules but of being attuned to a field of significance through **trained embodiment**.

His major expository achievement was **Being-in-the-World** in 1991, a commentary on **Division I of Heidegger’s Being and Time**. There **Dreyfus** clarified **worldhood** as the holistic web of **equipmental relations**, distinguished **ready-to-hand** involvement from **present-at-hand** observation, and unpacked the role of **moods** as **attunements** that disclose how things matter. He treated **breakdown** as a revelatory event that forces explicit thematization of what normally remains tacit in **absorbed coping**. Engaging analytic interlocutors such as **Robert Brandom** and **John McDowell**, **Dreyfus** defended **nonconceptual content** and argued against the priority of rational articulation, contending that conceptual inference rests upon a **preconceptual background** of practical intelligibility. This debate about **conceptualism** and **nonconceptual content** bears theological importance for **hermeneutics**, suggesting that biblical interpretation presupposes **pre-understandings** embedded in ecclesial life, and that **doctrine** refines rather than replaces **practices of discipleship**.

The critique of modern technology animated **On the Internet** in 2001 and 2009, and informed his ongoing appeals to **Heidegger’s enframing**. **Dreyfus** warned that online mediation promises frictionless access while eroding the **risk, resistance, and apprenticeship** that sustain **skill** and **meaning**. Disembodied presence, he argued, undermines the **solicitations** that arise within face-to-face practices and attenuates the **mooded attunement** through which communities share significance. His concerns parallel allied critiques such as **Albert Borgmann’s device paradigm**, though **Dreyfus** remained resolutely Heideggerian, asking how technological ordering renders things **standing-reserve** and so levels value. The point was not nostalgia but the recovery of **excellence** through committed **practices** that bind agents to standards internal to activities, whether in art, craft, or worship. In the register of theology, this provides a sharp lens for the **liturgical impoverishment** that accompanies pragmatic technocracy and consumerism.

Two late works expanded his horizon from critique to constructive cultural diagnosis. In **All Things Shining** in 2011, coauthored with **Sean D. Kelly**, **Dreyfus** traced Western shifts from **Homeric polyphony** to **Christian inwardness** to modern **nihilism**, arguing for a renewed receptivity to multiple **sources of meaning**. He commended a cultivated **piety of skill** that discerns moments when things **shine**, offering examples from **Homer**, **Aeschylus**, and **Melville**. The book faced criticism for its endorsement of a **polytheism of values** and for its thin account of normativity, yet it forced a reckoning with the spiritual vacuum of late modern life and proposed **ritual attentiveness** as a way beyond cynicism. In **Retrieving Realism** in 2015, with **Charles Taylor**, he articulated a **contact theory of knowledge** against mediational **representationalism**, proposing that agents are already in **contact** with a meaningful world through **embodied action** and that reflective articulation arises as a **second-order** practice. This **non-inferential realism** bolstered his lifelong claim that the **background** is not a mythology but the condition of intelligibility, and it offered allies in theology who seek a **sacramental realism** without capitulating to modern skepticism.

Conceptually, several tools define **Dreyfus**’s legacy. The notion of **background practices** names the historically sedimented, socially shared know-how that confers intelligibility on situations. The pair **affordances and solicitations** captures how the world invites action for a skilled agent. **Practical holism** asserts that meanings hang together within totalities of involvement, not as atomistic facts. **Mooded attunement** insists that affect is not subjective froth but an existential way in which a world is disclosed. **Absorbed coping** holds that expertise is largely nonrepresentational and nonreflective, though open to reflective breakdown and articulation. These concepts counter both **intellectualism** in epistemology and **proceduralism** in ethics, proposing instead that normativity is internal to **traditions of practice** and that excellence is grasped by participation in practices governed by **standards of worth**. Though not theology, this framework provides a phenomenology of how **worship**, **catechesis**, and **virtue formation** might be understood as training in **responsive attunement** to God’s world.

Theological readers have often appropriated **Dreyfus** to illuminate ecclesial formation, especially through conversations about **liturgy**, **habit**, and **virtue ethics**. His emphasis on **embodied know-how** underscores that Christian life is not a mental assent to propositions alone but a **patterned participation** in **means of grace** that calibrate attention, desire, and action. Sermon and sacrament can be redescribed as **world-disclosing practices**, where the **Word** names reality and the **Spirit** attunes hearts in **mooded gratitude**. The **Dreyfus model** suggests that sanctification involves movement from **novice obedience** through **competent discernment** toward **expert Christlikeness**, where the agent responds intuitively to the **solicitations** of the law of love. His analysis of **technological enframing** helps diagnose the flattening of worship into **consumer experience**, pressing churches to recover **risk, resistance, and apprenticeship** within thick communities of practice. Even **biblical hermeneutics** can be reframed in terms of **pre-understanding** and **tradition-constituted inquiry**, where doctrine refines the **background** of ecclesial life rather than floating free from it.

Yet **Dreyfus** is not a theologian, and his proposals raise clear theological questions. His story in **All Things Shining** gestures to a **polytheism of meanings** at odds with **classical monotheism**, and his immanent **world-disclosure** leaves little room for **revelation** that confronts and judges. His **anti-representationalism** rightly resists Cartesianism, but Christian confession still requires **truth-apt propositions** about God and the gospel. His account of **normativity** as internal to practices risks **relativism**, whereas Christian moral order rests on **divine law** and **covenantal grace** that can reform corrupt practices. And while **Retrieving Realism** supplies a needed antidote to skepticism, theology must ground such **contact** in **Creator–creature distinction**, **imago Dei**, and **providence**, not only in anthropological structures of skill. These tensions define the task of discerning appropriation.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, the evaluation is both appreciative and critical. **Dreyfus** offers a bracing correction to **representationalist epistemology** and an invaluable account of **embodied, communal knowing** that coheres with **covenantal epistemology**, **noetic effects of sin**, and **means-of-grace formation**. His critique of **technological enframing** strengthens Reformed wariness toward cultural idolatries and aligns with reformational analyses of **structure and direction**. Yet his **immanent disclosure** and **polysemous piety** cannot substitute for **Sola Scriptura**, **Word–Spirit revelation**, and the **law–gospel** grammar of sanctification. A constructive Reformed alternative receives his insights into **background practices** and **skillful coping**, but anchors them in **covenantal realism** where Scripture normatively discloses reality, the **Spirit** renews attunement, and the church’s **liturgy** and **catechesis** form experts in **faith working through love**. In this key, **Dreyfus** becomes a sharpened instrument for ecclesial wisdom rather than a substitute for theological first principles.
