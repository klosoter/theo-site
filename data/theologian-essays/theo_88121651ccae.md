### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, postconciliar context, and method
Ian Boxall emerges as a contemporary Catholic biblical theologian whose vocation is forged within the post–Vatican II settlement of **Dei Verbum** and the ensuing struggle to reunite **historical-critical exegesis** with **theological interpretation**. Educated in the Oxford ecosystem and teaching for years at **St Stephen's House, Oxford**, before moving to the **Catholic University of America** in the 2010s, Boxall inhabits an academic and ecclesial space where the **canon**, the **liturgy**, and the **church's tradition** are not competitors but coordinates for reading Scripture. His methodological center of gravity is **Wirkungsgeschichte** reception history, allied to **canonical reading** and an explicitly **ecclesial hermeneutic** shaped by the Catholic grammar of **Scripture and Tradition**. Influenced by **Hans-Georg Gadamer's** hermeneutics and exemplified in biblical studies by **Ulrich Luz**, Boxall treats the ongoing interpretive life of texts as a theologically significant manifestation of the **Spirit's guidance** of the **sensus fidelium**. This does not dismiss **philology**, **socio-historical analysis**, or **textual criticism**; rather, it places them within a larger account of how **the Word** unfolds in the **church's worship**, **visual culture**, and **doctrinal reflection**.

The methodological wager shows through early: Boxall consistently argues that the **Book of Revelation** and **Matthew's Gospel** traffic in symbolic worlds that cannot be reduced to ancient context alone. For him, **intertextual echoes** of Israel's Scriptures, the **liturgical performance** of texts, and the **visual imagination** in iconography and art comprise legitimate exegetical evidence. This broad-but-ruled approach reflects the renewed Catholic insistence after **Dei Verbum** that the **literal sense** includes the intentions of canonical shaping and ecclesial reception and that the **spiritual sense** emerges from the text's Christological and ecclesial telos. The result is a method that is historical without historicism, theological without romanticism, and reception-attentive without relativism.

#### 2. Revelation as vision, symbol, and doxology
Boxall's first sustained foray, **Revelation: Vision and Insight** (2002), framed the Apocalypse not as a cryptogram of future events but as a theologically charged pedagogy in **seeing**. The controlling claim is that Revelation is an apocalypse of perception: by repeated cycles of **vision and audition**, it trains the church to discern the Lamb's sovereignty amid imperial pretension. In conversation with **Richard Bauckham's** insistence on **monotheistic worship** and with **Elisabeth Schussler Fiorenza's** socio-political reading of **anti-imperial rhetoric**, Boxall emphasizes Revelation's thick **symbolic universe**. The book is a piece of **theological aesthetics** as much as **prophetic critique**, and so its reading must register **intertextuality** with Exodus, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Daniel, while tracking how **worship** functions as counter-politics. He aligns with the broad scholarly consensus locating Revelation in a late first-century **Domitianic** setting, giving due weight to the **imperial cult**, the language of **martyr-witness**, and the pastoral aim of **patient endurance**.

The fuller exegetical payoff arrives in **The Revelation of Saint John** in the **Black's New Testament Commentary** series (2006). Here Boxall offers a balanced, pastorally sensitive commentary that combines **narrative progression** with **rhetorical strategy**. He resists both totalizing **preterism** and speculative **futurism**, arguing for the genre's polyvalence under the rubric of **proleptic eschatology**: the future is disclosed in images that seize present moral imagination. By treating **the throne-vision of Revelation 4–5** as theological fulcrum, he foregrounds **Christological monotheism** and the **doxological** structure of divine sovereignty. Interlocutors such as **David Aune** and **G. K. Beale** are engaged appreciatively but critically; Boxall prefers to let the **liturgical scenes** and **OT echoes** govern the reading, cautioning against atomistic lexical grids or exhaustive source catalogs. The commentary exemplifies a hallmark of his craft: disciplined attention to the Greek text married to a confidence that **worship**, not speculation, is the primary theological outcome of Revelation.

#### 3. Patmos and the hermeneutics of place
With **Patmos in the Reception History of the Apocalypse** (2013), Boxall advanced a striking thesis about **place-memory** and **interpretation**. The island of **Patmos** functions not merely as a geographical footnote but as a node of **Wirkungsgeschichte** that has shaped how Revelation has been heard, seen, and enacted. Exploring **Byzantine** liturgy, **monastic** devotion, pilgrimage narratives, and modern artistic renderings, he argues that **Patmos** is a hermeneutical icon: a physical site that condenses the book's **prophetic witness** and **contemplative seeing**. The study exemplifies **visual exegesis** and the claim that reception is not a late accretion but integral to the text's **performative identity**. While honoring **historical-critical** cautions about anachronism, Boxall shows how **sacred geography** can be exegetically productive in Catholic theology, where **sacramentality** and **pilgrimage** belong to the church's interpretive habitus.

This approach yields case studies in how **the New Jerusalem**, **the Harlot Babylon**, and **the Lamb** have been depicted and venerated. In mosaics, icons, and Western paintings, the Apocalypse has generated a **visual canon** that in turn informs doctrinal imagination about **ecclesiology**, **eschatology**, and **political theology**. Boxall's proposal is not that art trumps exegesis, but that the **Spirit's economy** of interpretation includes the **liturgical arts** as non-trivial testimony. This widens the archive for theological exegesis to include ordo, architecture, chant, and pilgrimage, an extension entirely consonant with **Dei Verbum's** insistence on Scripture's life in the **Church**.

#### 4. Matthew as canonical memory and ecclesial charter
Parallel to his work on Revelation, Boxall has become a significant voice in **Matthean studies**. In **Discovering Matthew: Content, Interpretation, Reception** (2004; 2nd ed. 2014), he introduces Matthew as a carefully composed narrative that simultaneously remembers Jesus and **catechizes** the Church. The five-discourse architecture, **fulfillment citations**, and the programmatic **Emmanuel Christology** are treated as clues to the Gospel's **canonical** self-understanding. He presses the **intertextual** claims of the text, especially Matthew's rereading of **Torah** in the **Sermon on the Mount** and its framing of **ecclesial authority** in chapters 16 and 18. Reception history enters via patristic voices like **Augustine** and **Chrysostom**, medieval readers like **Aquinas**, and Reformation figures from **Luther** to **Calvin**, together evidencing Matthew's function as a **church order** and **moral catechesis** across centuries.

In **Matthew: A Guide for the Perplexed** (2011) and later in **Matthew Through the Centuries** (2019), Boxall consolidates the reception-historical program. The latter, in the **Blackwell Bible Commentaries** series, is a curated anthology of how the Gospel has been appropriated in **theology**, **preaching**, **art**, and **music**, from the early church to modernity. Key cruxes such as **the Beatitudes**, **the antitheses**, **the binding and loosing** logia, **the parables of the kingdom**, and **the Great Commission** are interpreted through a kaleidoscope of Christian memory. Boxall's theological accent remains steady: the **canon** and **liturgy** norm and enliven the Gospel's ongoing significance, and the church's manifold listening is not noise but a structured polyphony under the **analogia fidei**. He is alert to modern concerns about **supersessionism**, **Jewish-Christian relations**, and the ethical demands of **discipleship**, reading Matthew's **Israel-church** relation as fulfillment without erasure and his halakhic radicalization in 5–7 as the form of **messianic Torah**.

#### 5. Thematic synthesis: worship, witness, and wisdom
Boxall's twin foci cohere in an identifiable theological profile. In **Revelation**, he prioritizes **doxology** and **witness** as the two forms of ecclesial existence under the ascended Lamb. In **Matthew**, he foregrounds **wisdom** and **discipleship** under the teacher who is Emmanuel. The integration of **worship** and **ethics** is a recurring note: where Revelation summons liturgical loyalty against **Babylon**, Matthew articulates the shape of **kingdom righteousness** that resists the hypocrisy of **religious performance** and the seductions of **mammon**. Both texts are treated as **ecclesial charters** for communities under pressure, which is why Boxall invests so heavily in **liturgical hermeneutics**. Lectionary placement, feast-day associations, and the **rhythm of the church year** are not peripheral; they are the sites where Scripture addresses the Church and configures her **habitus**.

Under this synthesis lies a robust sense of **intertextuality** as theological logic. Revelation's images of **exodus**, **new creation**, and **temple** and Matthew's Mosaic typology draw Israel's story to **eschatological fulfillment** in Christ. Boxall deploys this intertextuality as more than scholarly cataloguing; it is the vehicle for **Trinitarian doxology** in Revelation 4–5 and for **Christological** claims in Matthew's Emmanuel inclusio. Theology, for Boxall, does not sit above exegesis; it crystallizes from within the structured echo-chambers of the canon received and prayed.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates
Boxall conducts this work in substantial dialogue with leading scholars across confessional lines. With **Ulrich Luz**, he affirms that **reception history** is not a modern hobby but intrinsic to how texts live. With **Richard Bauckham**, he underscores Revelation's **monotheistic worship** and **political-theological** bite. With **G. K. Beale**, he shares a commitment to **OT resonance**, while demurring from over-systematization that flattens Revelation's **symbolic polyvalence**. He draws on **David Aune's** historical detail without allowing genre taxonomy to displace **theological stakes**, and he appreciates **Craig Koester's** literary sensitivity and attention to **worship**. In Matthew studies, his conversation partners include **Davies and Allison** on **Jewish backgrounds**, **R. T. France** on **narrative flow**, and **Dale Allison** on **eschatology** and **ethics**, even as he extends their work into **liturgical** and **artistic** reception.

The debates Boxall enters are predictable and productive. On **Revelation**, he resists the binary of **preterist** versus **futurist** readings by arguing for a **liturgical-temporal spiral**, where past, present, and future are held in sacramental tension. On **authorship** and **date**, he opts for a late first-century setting with **John the seer** distinct from the Fourth Gospel's author, a consensus position that frees up theological analysis of the book's **visionary rhetoric**. On **Matthew**, he navigates the contested terrain of **ecclesiology** in 16 and 18, emphasizing communal **binding and loosing** while acknowledging the symbolic weight of **Peter's keys** in Catholic tradition. He is concerned to avoid **supersessionist** readings, maintaining the integrity of **Israel's election** within Matthew's **fulfillment** logic and welcoming recent **Jewish-Christian** dialogue as a salutary check.

#### 7. Ecclesial anchoring and the theological interpretation of Scripture
If there is a single constructive claim running through Boxall's corpus, it is that the **theological interpretation of Scripture** must be both **canonical** and **ecclesial** in order to be genuinely theological. The canon's final form is not merely a convenience; it is the Spirit-given horizon within which **intertextuality** is meaningful. The **church's worship**, catechesis, and artistic production are not marginal; they are constitutive enactments of Scripture's sense as **sacramentum audibile**. This is not a rejection of **historical-critical** rigor but a call to embed it within **traditioned** dispositions capacious enough to recognize how Revelation's **visions** and Matthew's **parables** continue to generate **doctrine**, **ethos**, and **hope**.

Boxall's Catholic commitments here are explicit. He invokes **Dei Verbum** on the unity of **Scripture and Tradition**, the role of the **Magisterium** in guarding the deposit, and the **sensus fidelium** as a corporate charism for reading. His work frequently cites the **Pontifical Biblical Commission's** 1993 document, "The Interpretation of the Bible in the Church," especially its commendation of **canonical exegesis**, **rhetorical analysis**, and **reception history**. Within that frame, Boxall models a generous, ecumenically porous scholarship that nevertheless treats **liturgy**, **creed**, and **art** as primary theological interlocutors for the exegete.

#### 8. Doctrinal dividends: Revelation's Lamb and Matthew's Emmanuel
The doctrinal dividends of Boxall's program are tangible. In **Revelation**, the focus on **worship** yields a robust **Christology** wherein the **Lamb** shares the divine throne, grounding a practical **Trinitarian doxology**. The **martyr-witness** motif shapes an ecclesiology of **faithful presence** and **public holiness**, while the critique of **Babylon** furnishes a grammar for **Christian political discernment**. His attention to **theodicy** reframes divine judgments as reparative acts ordered to **new creation**, and the **New Jerusalem** becomes an ecclesial icon of **sacramental communion** rather than an escapist fantasy. In **Matthew**, Boxall's reading clarifies **kingdom ethics**, the continuity and transfiguration of **Torah** under Jesus' authority, and the dynamics of **mission** in the **Great Commission** where baptism, teaching, and Emmanuel-presence coinhere. The **Petrine** and communal **keys** texts are set within a broader vision of an **ekklesia** formed by mercy, discipline, and instruction.

These doctrinal trajectories are not culturally neutral; they are ecclesially formative. By relocating exegesis within **liturgy**, Boxall invites communities to let Revelation's **hymns** form their prayer and Matthew's **Sermon** discipline their ethics. By recovering **visual exegesis**, he encourages pastors and theologians to see art, architecture, and hymnody as repositories of the Word's **Wirkungsgeschichte**, and thus as sources for **doctrinal reasoning**. The cumulative effect is a theological interpretation that is spiritually nourishing, historically literate, and aesthetically alive.

#### 9. Influence, pedagogy, and scope
Boxall's influence flows through multiple channels. As a commentator in major series like **Black's New Testament Commentary** and **Blackwell Bible Commentaries**, he has placed a **reception-rich** yet **exegetically responsible** model before students and clergy. At the **Catholic University of America**, his pedagogy folds **Greek exegesis**, **intertextual method**, and **visual culture** into a single curriculum, showing how Revelation and Matthew can be taught as living texts for **catechesis** and **homiletics**. In conferences and essays, he collaborates across confessional lines with scholars like **Craig Koester**, **Bauckham**, and **Beale**, demonstrating by practice that **tradition-conscious** exegesis does not foreclose critical conversation. His work has been taken up by liturgists, pastors, and artists who find in it a theological charter for integrating **exegesis**, **worship**, and **beauty**.

The scope of Boxall's project is intentionally moderate and ecclesial rather than revolutionary or system-building. He is not inventing a new doctrine of Scripture; he is retrieving, within a Catholic frame, the church's longstanding confidence that the **canon** is best understood when it is read, sung, pictured, and obeyed in the Church. Within contemporary debates over the **theological interpretation of Scripture**, his voice is a calm insistence that **reception history** is not a detour from theology but one of its roads home.

In Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Boxall's gains and pressures can be stated together. Positively, his commitment to **canonical exegesis**, rich **OT intertextuality**, and the centrality of **worship** in **Revelation** resonates with a **redemptive-historical** hermeneutic that prizes Scripture's unity and Christological telos. His resistance to speculative **futurism** and his insistence that Revelation forms ethical witness align with **covenantal** readings that locate the church's life under the lordship of the **Lamb**. The pressure points concern normativity and authority. Where Boxall leans into **Wirkungsgeschichte** and **liturgy** as constitutive of meaning under **Scripture and Tradition**, a Reformed **sola Scriptura** will insist on the primacy of the **analogia Scripturae** and **authorial discourse intent** for doctrinal norming, granting reception evidential value but not rule. In **Matthew 16**, Boxall's openness to a Catholic **Petrine** accent contrasts with a Reformed construal of the **keys of the kingdom** as lodged in the **ministerial church** under Christ, with no unique Petrine primacy; similarly, his sacramental and liturgical framing of **New Jerusalem** may, at times, risk diluting the textual emphasis on **new-creational** consummation in favor of present **ecclesial** actualization. Finally, on **Israel and the church**, a Reformed covenantal approach may press for more programmatic articulation of **covenant continuity** to guard against latent **supersessionism**, even in mitigated form. A Reformed alternative, exemplified by **Beale** on Revelation and **covenant-theological** readings of Matthew, would affirm Boxall's canonical instincts while tightening hermeneutical controls around **Scripture's self-interpretation** as the regulative norm for doctrine, worship, and polity.
