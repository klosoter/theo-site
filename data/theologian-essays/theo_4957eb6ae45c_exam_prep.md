### TITLE
Martin Luther is the explosive catalyst of the Reformation whose law–gospel hermeneutic and justification by faith alone remain indispensable, even as his sacramental and churchly commitments require careful Reformed correction.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Martin Luther** (1483–1546) stands at the heart of the sixteenth‑century **Reformation**, reacting against late medieval **scholasticism** and the crisis of Christendom in the **Holy Roman Empire**.
- Trained in **Erfurt** and active in **Wittenberg**, he moves from Augustinian **monasticism** to evangelical reform under the pressures of **indulgences** and the **Diet of Worms** in 1521.

- Luther does theology as **oratio, meditatio, tentatio**, a spirituality of prayer, meditation, and trial, insisting that true knowledge of God comes through **Scripture** in the crucible of **Anfechtung**.
- His method is a polemical **theologia crucis** over against a **theologia gloriae**, using biblical exegesis, pastoral concern, and sharp dialectic rather than speculative **metaphysics**.
- He relativizes unaided **reason** in theology, calling it the devil's whore when it invades the domain of **revelation**, yet employs it vigorously as a tool in exegesis and disputation.

- The **95 Theses** (1517) attack the abuse of **indulgences** and redefine **penance** as repentance rather than a sacramental work.
- The **Heidelberg Disputation** (1518) articulates the **theology of the cross**, where God is known in suffering and the hiddenness of **Christ crucified**.
- The treatises of 1520, especially **The Freedom of a Christian** and **The Babylonian Captivity of the Church**, redefine **justification** and the **sacraments** against Rome.
- The **Bondage of the Will** (1525), written against **Erasmus**, defends monergistic **grace** and the impotence of the human will in matters of salvation.

- Luther is decisive for **soteriology**, especially **justification by faith alone** and the law–gospel distinction, as received in the **Augsburg Confession** and **Formula of Concord**.
- He is central for **Scripture and revelation**, especially **sola Scriptura**, translation, and the clarity and sufficiency of the **Word of God**.
- His **Christology** and **sacramental theology**, particularly the **Lord's Supper** and ubiquity of Christ's human nature, shape Lutheran identity and provoke Reformed critique.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to affirm Luther's **justification by faith alone**, his insistence on **sola Scriptura**, and his **theologia crucis**, while clearly rejecting his **Eucharistic** ubiquitarianism and some aspects of his **two-kingdoms** doctrine.
- You should position **Calvin** and classic **Reformed orthodoxy** as heirs who refine Luther's insights into a more coherent doctrine of **covenant**, **church**, and **sacraments**.

- Be ready to compare **Luther vs Calvin** on **Lord's Supper** and **law and gospel**, especially the third use of the **law**.
- Be ready to compare **Luther vs Erasmus** on **free will**, and **Luther vs Trent** on **justification** and **Scripture**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**Martin Luther** was born in 1483 in Eisleben and educated in **Erfurt**, entering the Augustinian **monastery** after a crisis in a thunderstorm. His early formation was in late medieval **scholasticism** and **nominalism**, especially **Gabriel Biel**, yet as an Augustinian friar he also absorbed **Augustine** on sin and grace. In **Wittenberg**, under **Johann Staupitz**, Luther lectured on the **Psalms** and **Romans**, wrestling with the problem of a righteous God who judges sinners. The presenting crisis of the **indulgence** controversy in 1517, with Tetzel's preaching and the **95 Theses**, forced him to ask how sinners find a gracious God and what authority the **papacy** and **councils** actually hold. His theological drive is to resolve the problem of an anxious conscience before the **justice of God** and to liberate that conscience from the machinery of late medieval **penance** and ecclesiastical power.

Luther's so‑called **tower experience**, where he came to see in **Romans 1:17** that the righteousness of God is a gift in Christ rather than a standard for judgment, reframed his reading of **Scripture** and his view of **justification**. The crucial biographical moments, from the **Heidelberg Disputation** in 1518, through the **Leipzig Disputation** in 1519, to the **Diet of Worms** in 1521, trace his break with **Rome** and his emerging conviction that the **Word of God** alone binds the conscience. Theologically the driving problem is twofold: first, how can a sinner stand righteous before a holy **God**; second, where is that God to be found and on what basis is his voice authoritative over against **church tradition** and scholastic reasoning. His mature answer is the **theologia crucis** and the doctrine of **justification by faith alone**, grounded in Christ's alien righteousness imputed through the Word and received by faith.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Luther's method is encapsulated in the triad of **oratio, meditatio, tentatio**, especially evident in his **Preface to the Wittenberg Edition of his Works** and his exposition of **Psalm 119**. For **Luther**, theology arises from the encounter with **Scripture** in prayerful meditation and in real spiritual trial, what he calls **Anfechtung**, the assaults of Satan, conscience, and despair. Over against scholastic systems, he insists that true **revelation** takes place where God addresses the sinner in the **Word**, and that knowledge of God as Redeemer is bound to **Christ crucified**. This is the burden of the **Heidelberg Disputation**, where he contrasts the **theologia crucis**, which calls things what they are, with the **theologia gloriae**, which constructs speculative accounts of God from observed works and philosophical ideas.

On **Scripture**, Luther affirms **sola Scriptura** but in a way shaped by his pastoral and Christocentric instincts rather than by later Reformed **prolegomena**. In his **Address to the Christian Nobility** and his polemics against **Cajetan** and **Eck**, he insists that popes and councils can err, while **Scripture** cannot. Yet he also employs a robust **Scripture interprets Scripture** approach, privileging certain books that most clearly preach **Christ** and **justification**, such as **Romans** and **Galatians**, which he calls the bride of his soul. His famous comments on **James** as an epistle of straw show his functional canon within the canon, which later **Lutheran orthodoxy** tends to restrain, but they remind us that his criterion is the clarity of Christ in the **gospel**.

Regarding **reason** and **philosophy**, Luther is sharply critical of speculative **metaphysics** in theology, mocking **Aristotle** in the **Disputation against Scholastic Theology** and calling reason the devil's whore when it invades the domain of **revelation**. Yet he is not irrationalist; he uses careful arguments in **The Bondage of the Will** against **Erasmus**, appeals to grammar and logic in exegesis, and affirms that **natural law** written on the heart gives real though limited moral knowledge. Experience in Luther always means existential confrontation with **God** in Christ, particularly the experience of **law and gospel**, rather than Romantic feeling. Church and **history** function as witnesses rather than as norms; he will appeal to **Augustine** and the early councils, yet he subordinates them rigorously to the written **Word of God**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
On **revelation and Scripture**, the confessional baseline is that God reveals himself in the **incarnate Word** and in the **written Word**, which is inspired, sufficient, and the final norm for faith and life. Luther heightens the immediacy and sufficiency of **Scripture** against **Rome**, arguing in the **Leipzig Disputation** and later writings that councils and popes have erred, and that only **Scripture** can bind conscience. His principle of **sola Scriptura** is not a naked biblicism; he translates the **Bible** into German, preaches lectio continua on books, and sees the canon as a unified witness to **Christ**. His tension with Reformed orthodoxy emerges in his more flexible view of canon order and his willingness to rank books according to their clarity in preaching **Christ**, as seen in his prefaces to **Hebrews**, **James**, and **Revelation**. Nonetheless, Reformed theologians such as **Calvin** and later **Bavinck** recognize in Luther's Scripture principle a decisive break from **tradition** as a parallel authority.

In **soteriology**, and especially in **justification**, the catholic baseline is that God justifies the ungodly on the basis of **Christ's** work, through grace and by faith. Luther's decisive contribution is to make **justification by faith alone** the articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae, the article by which the church stands or falls, as reflected in the **Augsburg Confession** and later in the **Formula of Concord**. In his **Lectures on Romans** and **Galatians**, as well as in **The Freedom of a Christian**, he articulates the double exchange, where Christ takes our sin and gives us his **alien righteousness**, imputed and not infused. Over against **Trent** and the medieval **via moderna**, Luther denies that any human preparation or cooperation contributes to justification, so that faith is a purely receptive instrument. In **The Bondage of the Will** against **Erasmus**, he defends monergistic **grace**, insisting that the human will is bound in sin and that God alone regenerates and grants faith, a line that the Reformed will later develop into a more explicit doctrine of **effectual calling** and **definite atonement**.

Concerning **Law and Gospel** and **sanctification**, the Reformed baseline affirms three uses of the **law**: civil, pedagogical, and normative for the believer. Luther's distinctive contribution is his sharp hermeneutical and existential distinction between **law** as that which commands and condemns, and **gospel** as the pure promise of forgiveness in **Christ**, a distinction visible in his sermons and in the **Galatians Commentary**. For Luther, this distinction is not merely historical but perennially operative in the believers life, as the Word both kills and makes alive. He clearly acknowledges civil and theological uses of the **law**, but his language can at times sound suspicious of an abiding third use as a guide for the regenerate, which becomes a point of later Lutheran controversy. The **Formula of Concord** affirms the third use, but Reformed theologians like **Calvin** and **Turretin** systematize it more clearly, in part to answer Lutherans who feared a return to a **theologia gloriae** under the guise of moral law.

In **Christology and the sacraments**, the Chalcedonian baseline confesses one person in two natures, divine and human, without confusion, change, division, or separation, and the broader catholic baseline affirms real participation in **Christ** in **baptism** and the **Lord's Supper**. Luther robustly affirms **Chalcedon**, but his sacramental theology, particularly in the **Lord's Supper**, leads him to a distinctive understanding of the communication of properties. Against **Zwingli** at **Marburg** and in his **Confession Concerning Christs Supper** (1528), Luther insists on the real, bodily presence of **Christ** in, with, and under the bread and wine, on the basis of the words of institution, "This is my body." To underwrite this, Lutheran theology comes to affirm a genus maiestaticum, where the human nature of **Christ** participates in divine ubiquity, a view the Reformed reject as a confusion of the natures. Luther also maintains baptismal regeneration and the objectivity of the **Word** in the sacrament, yet he strongly rejects ex opere operato and insists on the necessity of **faith**, placing the accent on **promise** rather than on sacramental causality. Reformed theology appreciates his insistence on the objective promise and real communion, yet denies the ubiquitarian implication as undermining the finite–infinite distinction that **Chalcedon** protects.

On **church and two kingdoms**, the baseline catholic view sees the **church** as the people of God gathered around Word and sacrament, with a distinct spiritual authority, while recognizing the civil magistrate. In his **Address to the Christian Nobility** and later political writings, Luther redefines the **church** around the preaching of the **gospel** and right administration of the sacraments, undercutting the **clericalism** of late medieval Rome. At the same time, he articulates a **two-kingdoms** doctrine in which God rules the spiritual kingdom by **Word** and sacrament and the temporal kingdom by **law** and the sword, urging Christians to submit to authorities even when they are harsh, as evident in his controversial stance in the **Peasants War**. Later **Lutheranism** can tend toward a sharper dualism between church and politics, whereas Reformed thinkers like **Calvin** and **Vos** deploy a more integrated covenantal vision of **kingdom**, creation, and redemption, while still distinguishing spiritual and civil jurisdictions.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians such as **Calvin**, **Beza**, **Turretin**, and later **Bavinck** receive Luther as the initial fountain of evangelical recovery of the **gospel**, yet they also regard their own work as a needed dogmatic clarification and expansion of his insights. On **justification**, the **Institutes** echo Luther's emphasis on imputed **righteousness** and faith as instrument, and **Turretin** explicitly aligns with **The Bondage of the Will** in rejecting **Erasmian** synergism. On **Scripture**, Reformed scholastics systematize **sola Scriptura** and its implications for **inspiration** and **inerrancy**, lines that are consonant with Luther's deep instinct that the **Word of God** is self-authenticating and supremely authoritative. At the same time, Reformed orthodoxy rejects Luther's sacramental ubiquitarianism and his doctrine of Christ's **bodily presence** in the Supper, arguing instead, with **Calvin**, for a real spiritual presence through the **Holy Spirit** and the ascended humanity of **Christ** remaining in heaven.

A Westminster examiner must object at least to two points in Luther. First, the Lutheran development of Christological **ubiquity** and its entailment for the **Eucharist** is incompatible with classic Reformed **Christology** and the extra Calvinisticum, which guards the integrity of both natures and the transcendence of the **Logos**. Second, some Lutheran articulations of **law and gospel**, when detached from a robust third use of the law, can tend toward antinomian misunderstandings that Reformed confessions, such as the **Westminster Standards**, strongly resist. Yet a Reformed theologian should learn from Luther's relentless focus on **Christ crucified**, his existentially serious account of **Anfechtung** and conscience, and his insistence that the center of the Christian life is the repeated hearing of the **gospel** rather than introspective analysis of sanctification. Modern Reformed voices like **Vos** and **Van Til** can also appropriate Luther's **theologia crucis** as a protest against any natural theology that bypasses **Christ**, while still maintaining a properly Reformed doctrine of **general revelation** and **common grace**.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam the safest opening line to use is something like: **Martin Luther** is the initial architect of the Reformation, whose recovery of **justification by faith alone** and a **theology of the cross** reshaped Western Christianity. That lets you foreground his positive contribution and signal that you see him as foundational but not final. Other safe sentences include: Luther teaches a sharp **law–gospel** distinction as a hermeneutical and existential key; Luther affirms **sola Scriptura** as the only infallible rule for faith and life; and Luther's **Bondage of the Will** is arguably his most theologically important work because it protects monergistic **grace** against **Erasmus**. When you discuss his sacramental theology, a safe formulation is: Luther insists on the real presence of **Christ** in the Supper and roots it in the words of institution, though the Reformed must reject the later Lutheran doctrine of Christ's **ubiquity**.

There are also phrases you must avoid or carefully qualify. Do not say that Luther rejects **natural theology** without qualification; instead say that Luther is deeply suspicious of speculative **reason** in theology and of a **theologia gloriae**, yet he still affirms **natural law** and a genuine though limited knowledge of God as Creator. Avoid saying Luther denies the third use of the **law**; better to say that his emphasis on the condemnatory function of law sometimes overshadows its normative role, which later **Lutherans** debate, while the Reformed clarify the third use. Do not casually endorse a **Lutheran two-kingdoms** doctrine without distinguishing it from a Reformed **two-kingdoms** or **two-ages** framework, and be ready to distance yourself from Luther's harsh rhetoric in the **Peasants War** and his late **anti-Jewish** writings as inconsistent with a biblical **ethic**. You should also avoid giving the impression that Luther is anti-church; instead stress that he redefines **church** around Word and sacrament rather than hierarchy and canon law.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings about Luther that students bring. One common error is to portray Luther as purely individualistic, as if justification were a private event detached from **church** and sacrament, whereas he actually maintains a strong doctrine of the preached **Word** and the gathered congregation. Another misunderstanding is to assume that Luther is less doctrinal or systematic than **Calvin**; while his writings are more occasional and polemical, Luther does operate with coherent doctrinal commitments evident in the **Catechisms** and confessional documents like the **Augsburg Confession**. A third landmine is to conflate Luther with later **liberal Protestantism** simply because of his experience of **Anfechtung**; you must insist that his norm is the external **Word of God** and that he decisively rejects any **Schleiermacher**-style grounding of theology in feeling. If pressed, you can also contrast Luther positively with modern existentialism, since his **theologia crucis** is grounded in a real historical **Christ** and an objective atonement, not in subjective authenticity.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Luther is gratefully received as the first great evangelical voice who recovers **sola Scriptura**, **sola fide**, and a robust **theologia crucis**, and who teaches us to preach **law and gospel** to wounded consciences with relentless Christocentric focus, yet we must firmly deny his sacramental ubiquity, any weakening of the abiding normativity of **God's law**, and any functional canon within the canon that could undercut the plenary authority of the whole **Scripture**, so my own position is that we stand with Luther on justification and Scripture as against **Rome** and **Erasmus**, while following **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Standards** in refining his insights into a more coherent system of covenantal **Christology**, sacramental presence, and law–gospel balance that preserves both the free grace of God in Christ and the comprehensive lordship of Christ over every sphere of life.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Martin Luther** is the foundational Reformation theologian whose recovery of **justification by faith alone** and a **theology of the cross** reshaped Western Christianity and still shapes our doctrine of salvation and Scripture.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- 1483–1546: **Luther** is born in Eisleben, studies at **Erfurt**, teaches at **Wittenberg**, and sparks the **Reformation** with the **95 Theses** in 1517.
- 1518–1521: From the **Heidelberg Disputation** through the **Diet of Worms**, Luther breaks with **Rome** over indulgences, authority, and **justification**.
- 1520–1525: In works like **The Freedom of a Christian**, **The Babylonian Captivity of the Church**, and **The Bondage of the Will**, Luther redefines **sacraments**, **church**, and **free will**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Luther's method of **oratio, meditatio, tentatio** means theology is done in prayerful engagement with **Scripture** amid real **Anfechtung**.
- He exalts **sola Scriptura** over **councils** and scholastic **reason**, yet uses reason as a servant in exegesis and argument as in **The Bondage of the Will**.
- He centers **revelation** in the **Word of God** and especially in **Christ crucified**, rejecting any **theologia gloriae** that seeks God apart from the cross.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **justification**, Luther teaches imputed **alien righteousness**, received by faith alone apart from works, crystallized in his **Romans** and **Galatians** lectures and the **Augsburg Confession**.
- On **law and gospel**, he insists on a sharp distinction between condemning **law** and promising **gospel**, as the basic hermeneutical and pastoral key of Christian life.
- On **Scripture**, he affirms **sola Scriptura** as the only infallible norm, while practically privileging those books that most clearly preach **Christ** and **justification**.
- On **Christology and the Supper**, he affirms Chalcedon yet supports a real bodily presence of **Christ** in the Eucharist linked to a controversial doctrine of **ubiquity**.
- On **two kingdoms**, he distinguishes God's rule by **Word** in the church from his rule by **law** and the sword in the civil realm, shaping later **Lutheran** political thought.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Reformed examiners will press Luther's doctrine of **Christ's ubiquity** and real bodily presence in the **Lord's Supper** as conflicting with classic Reformed **Christology** and the extra Calvinisticum.
- They will question his sometimes ambiguous treatment of the third use of the **law**, insisting with **Westminster** on the law's abiding normative role for believers.
- They will want you to qualify his apparent canon within the canon, affirming the full authority and inspiration of all **Scripture**, not only **Romans** and **Galatians**.
- They may press his **two-kingdoms** doctrine and political counsel, contrasting it with a more integrated Reformed vision of **kingdom** and cultural obedience.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Luther vs Erasmus** on the **Bondage of the Will** and monergistic **grace** versus synergistic free will.
- **Luther vs Trent** on **justification**, **Scripture and tradition**, and the nature of **sacramental** efficacy.
- **Luther vs Calvin** on the **Lord's Supper** and on the third use of the **law** within a law–gospel framework.
- **Luther vs Aquinas** on the role of **reason** and **natural theology** in speaking about God.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- From a Reformed Westminster standpoint, **Luther** is the indispensable evangelical pioneer whose doctrine of **justification** and **theology of the cross** we gratefully inherit, even as we reject his **ubiquitarian** sacramentology and refine his law–gospel and Scripture principles within a fuller confessional system.
