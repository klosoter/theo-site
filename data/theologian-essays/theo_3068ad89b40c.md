### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Craig M. Gay is a contemporary evangelical scholar at **Regent College** whose vocation has been to name and resist the characteristic pressures of **late modernity** that make it tempting for Christians to live as if God were absent. Situated within an academic community where **biblical theology**, **pastoral formation**, and **interdisciplinary studies** are held together, Gay appropriates the diagnostic tools of **sociology of religion** to serve **systematic theology**. He reads **Max Weber** on **disenchantment**, **Peter L. Berger** on **plausibility structures**, and **Charles Taylor** on the **immanent frame**, then turns to classical Christian resources such as **creation providence**, **incarnation**, and **ecclesial practice** to re-personalize the world before **the living God**. In short, his enduring methodological thesis is that theology must describe the **modern social imaginary** with empirical sobriety and respond with doctrinally thick pastoral counsel that restores **coram Deo** awareness.

Gay’s method is two-step and explicitly interdisciplinary: a descriptive diagnosis of **structural temptation** and a normative call to **discipleship practices** grounded in **dogmatics**. He is influenced by **Michael Polanyi** on **tacit knowledge** and insists that the most potent modern beliefs are often pretheoretical habits lodged in **technological systems**, **market forms**, and **bureaucratic routines** rather than in overt metaphysical claims. Accordingly, his theology of culture retrieves **Augustine’s ordo amoris**, **Calvin’s duplex cognitio Dei**, and a Protestant sense of **vocation** to frame counter-habits such as **Sabbath**, **prayer**, and **focal practices**. As a teacher in a graduate school emphasizing spiritual formation, he writes with pastoral cadence while keeping a scholar’s eye on **conceptual precision**.

Gay’s intellectual setting is the shift from classic **secularization theory** to more nuanced accounts of **multiple modernities**, from triumphalist narratives of progress to anxious recognitions of **technological determinism** and **surveillance capitalism**. This moment presses theological questions about **agency**, **personhood**, and **meaning** within systems that feel impersonal and inexorable. Gay’s answer is neither withdrawal nor naive accommodation but a realist **Augustinian** pilgrimage that confronts the **saeculum** by attending to **God’s providential presence** and to the **church’s common life** as a school of truthful perception.

#### 2. Early work: capitalism, justice, and evangelical social thought
Gay’s first major book, **With Liberty and Justice for Whom? The Recent Evangelical Debate over Capitalism** (1991), maps contending evangelical responses to **market capitalism** at the end of the Cold War. Reading proponents of laissez-faire economics alongside social-justice advocates, he critiques the reduction of **human flourishing** to **economic growth** and the evaporation of thick moral vocabularies under the pressure of **instrumental rationality**. Here, Weber’s analysis of **rationalization** becomes a theological concern: economic forms can normalize **impersonality** and **commodification**, training Christians to prize efficiency over **justice** and **charity**. Gay proposes a chastened **Augustinian realism** about political economy, encouraging **institutional pluralism**, the revaluation of **household and local associations**, and the retrieval of **vocation** as stewardship under **divine providence**. The book marks his enduring interest in how structural forces teach us to forget **God** while promising freedom.

The constructive thread in this early work is Gay’s insistence that evangelicals need more than proof-texted **ethics**; they require an interpretive account of modernity’s moral ecology. To that end, he invokes **creation order** and **imago Dei** to re-center economic reasoning on **persons** rather than aggregates or utility, while drawing on **natural-law** resonances to recover basic goods of **work**, **family**, and **community**. The upshot is not a detailed policy program but a theological metric by which to assess systems: do they foster or inhibit **personal relations** lived **coram Deo**?

#### 3. The central thesis: living as if God does not exist
Gay’s most influential work, **The Way of the (Modern) World: Or, Why It’s Tempting to Live as If God Doesn’t Exist** (1998), crystallizes his theological diagnosis of **practical atheism**. Borrowing from **Berger** and **Taylor**, he argues that modern life is organized by **plausibility structures** and an **immanent frame** that render God unnecessary for day-to-day navigation. The problem is not primarily intellectual disbelief but habituated **forgetfulness** produced by **bureaucracy**, **technological mediation**, **market structures**, and **therapeutic subjectivism**. Each subsystem rewards **control**, **predictability**, and **self-optimization**, thereby marginalizing **prayer**, **dependence**, and **gratitude**.

Theologically, Gay retrieves **providence** as a doctrine not of mere metaphysical sustenance but of **God’s active governance** that invites continual **petition** and **praise**. He argues that Christians must relearn the grammar of **petitionary prayer** in a world trained to trust only **technique**. He also recovers a Protestant **sacramentality of ordinary life** in which **vocation**, **meals**, and **timekeeping** bear witness to **the Father’s care** through **the Son** in **the Spirit**. Concretely, he commends practices like **Sabbath rest**, **family table fellowship**, and **public worship** that interrupt the cadence of **instrumental reason**. The metaphysical claim that God is not far from us becomes, through such practices, an epistemic and moral habit of living **before God** in the midst of an impersonal order.

#### 4. Money and meaning: the critique of commodification
In **Cash Values: Money and the Erosion of Meaning in Contemporary Life** (2004), Gay turns from the macro-systems of **modernity** to the symbolic medium of **money**, arguing that monetization reconfigures value itself. Drawing on **Georg Simmel** and **Weber**, he shows how money’s universality and fungibility encourage **abstraction**, **comparability**, and **exchangeability**, thereby corroding **thick relations** and collapsing **qualitative goods** into **quantitative calculation**. The telos of life becomes financial maximization; theologically, **avarice** masquerades as prudent stewardship, and **gratitude** yields to **scarcity thinking**.

Gay’s constructive answer is a eucharistic and doxological anthropology: **creatures** receive rather than produce their being; therefore economic life must be subordinated to **thanksgiving** and **gift**. He appeals to **Augustine’s ordo amoris** to reorder loves away from **mammon** toward **God** and neighbor, and to **Calvin’s doctrine of vocation** to place economic labor under **divine calling** rather than self-making. Practices like **tithing**, **almsgiving**, and **Sabbath economy** signal limits to commodification and re-train desire for **the kingdom of God**. Here again, Gay binds structural critique to pastoral pedagogy, insisting that doctrinally thick practices unmask money’s false totality.

#### 5. Language about God in an impersonal age
With **Dialogue, Catalogue, and Monologue: Personal, Impersonal, and Depersonalizing Ways of Talking about God** (2012), Gay addresses theological speech itself under conditions of **impersonality**. He observes three temptations: a **catalogue** of divine attributes abstracted from **Scripture** and **prayer**; a **monologue** wherein ideology speaks over God; and a collapse of dialogue into therapeutic self-talk. Against these, he argues for genuinely **dialogical speech** with the living Lord, shaped by **biblical narrative**, **psalmic petition**, and the **church’s worship**. The goal is not to abandon **classical theism** but to recover its personal register so that doctrines such as **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **providence** are confessed as the perfections of the God who addresses and hears his people.

This work extends Gay’s core concern: where **impersonality** dominates, theological discourse can mimic the world’s tone even while affirming orthodox content. He advocates a pedagogy of **prayerful theology** in which doctrinal learning is conjoined to practices that cultivate attentiveness to **God’s presence**. His use of **Michael Polanyi’s** insight into **personal knowledge** underwrites a modest yet confident epistemology: we know God truly, though not exhaustively, by being apprenticed in the community that hears and answers **the Word**.

#### 6. Technology and the future of the human
In **Modern Technology and the Human Future: A Christian Appraisal** (2018), Gay synthesizes the legacies of **Jacques Ellul**, **Albert Borgmann**, and **Neil Postman** to examine the **technological society**. He resists both naive **instrumentalism**, which treats technology as neutral, and fatalistic **determinism**, which regards technique as irresistible. Instead, he highlights the cultural pattern of **device paradigm** and the moral habit of seeking **efficiency**, **convenience**, and **control** as master goods. Here theologically, **creaturely limits** and **contingency** are experienced as defects to be solved rather than gifts to be received, and **transhumanism** emerges as a secular eschatology promising salvation by enhancement.

Gay’s constructive response centers on **creation** and **providence** as terms of creaturely freedom under **divine lordship**. He recommends **focal practices** that gather persons around goods resistant to technological flattening, like **communal singing**, **shared meals**, **craftsmanship**, and **Sabbath liturgies**. He reframes **imago Dei** not as license for unlimited **dominion** but as a vocation to **wise stewardship**, love of neighbor, and truthful naming of the world. He warns that **surveillance capitalism** commodifies attention and undermines **personhood**, urging churches to curate spaces of **presence**, **silence**, and **face-to-face** communion as a counter-liturgical witness to the **Triune God**.

#### 7. Doctrinal substructure and theological development
Across his corpus, Gay’s doctrinal center is the interplay of **creation ex nihilo**, **providence**, and the **church** as the sphere where reality becomes intelligible **in Christ**. He is not a specialist in scholastic metaphysics, yet he carefully aligns his practical theology with **classical theism**, avoiding both **process theology** and **deism** by insisting on God’s intimate **presence** that does not collapse into **immanence**. His appeals to **Augustine** and **Calvin** anchor an anthropology of **dependence**, while his pastoral counsel entrusts ordinary time to **God’s governance**. He develops a Protestant **sacramentality of ordinary life** that ascribes ontological depth to **creaturely goods** without confusing them with **means of grace**, and he reads **Protestant vocation** as an ascetical way in the world ordered by **love**.

Gay’s engagement with social theory remains theologically disciplined. **Weber’s disenchantment**, **Berger’s plausibility structures**, and **Taylor’s immanent frame** provide maps, not magisteria. He translates their insights into doctrinal idiom by asking how **sin**, **idolatry**, and **vanity** encode themselves in systems, and how **grace**, **sanctification**, and **hope** are embodied in **ecclesial practices**. The theological development is consistent: structural analysis ushers in pastoral prescription, all in service of seeing and living **coram Deo** amid an impersonal world.

#### 8. Interlocutors, alignments, and distinctives
While sharing with **Stanley Hauerwas** a critique of **liberal individualism** and with **Oliver O’Donovan** a high doctrine of **political authority** under **Christ’s kingship**, Gay is less ecclesiocentric and more concerned with re-personalizing ordinary life through rediscovered **creation goods**. His affinities with **neo-Calvinism** are evident in appeals to **creation order**, **sphere sovereignty**, and **common grace**, yet he resists a triumphalist cultural program by foregrounding **temptation** and **ascetical practices**. He draws on **Albert Borgmann** to commend **focal practices**, on **Jacques Ellul** to disclose the spiritual ambitions of **technique**, and on **Charles Taylor** to parse the **immanent frame**. The distinctive note is a pastoral theological humanism: he wants Christians to become attentive persons whose speech, time, and work are personalized by **God’s presence** rather than depersonalized by **systems**.

Gay’s voice is also dialogical toward fellow evangelicals. He cautions market-optimists that **commodification** is a spiritual pedagogy, not a neutral tool, and he warns political-theology enthusiasts that **rhetoric** without **habits** will not re-form perception. He is sympathetic to **natural-law** language insofar as it stabilizes **creation norms**, yet he insists that the **church’s worship** is the primary school where human beings learn to see the world truly. His is a theology of culture in which **doctrine**, **discipline**, and **desire** converge.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Gay’s corpus is a salutary exercise in general revelation’s cultural exegesis disciplined by special revelation’s dogmatic grammar. His insistence on **creation and providence**, his recovery of **vocation**, and his pastoral use of **Sabbath** and **prayer** resonate with **Calvin’s** attention to ordinary life lived **coram Deo**. His deployment of **Weber**, **Berger**, and **Taylor** exemplifies a **Van Tilian** appropriation of borrowed capital: he reads the world through lenses that, when chastened by **Scripture**, can serve the antithesis between **idolatry** and **worship**. Yet tensions remain. First, his idiom of a Protestant **sacramentality of ordinary life** risks blurring the Reformed distinction between **means of grace** and other **creation goods** unless carefully subordinated to **Word and sacrament** in the church. Second, while his emphasis on practices is pastoral gold, a WTS critique would urge a more explicit covenantal frame in which **law and gospel**, **covenant lordship**, and the triadic **authority, control, presence** of Christ’s kingship over culture supply the principled alternative to **instrumental reason**. Third, his appeal to **common grace** could be further specified by **antithesis** so that the church’s counter-cultural posture is not reduced to technique-substitution but is transparently evangelically ordered to **regeneration**, **sanctification**, and the **means of grace**. Strengthened by these clarifications, Gay’s program powerfully equips Reformed pastors to shepherd congregations through the idols of **money**, **technique**, and **impersonality** with the ordinary but mighty weapons of **preaching**, **prayer**, **Sabbath**, and **hospitality** under the lordship of **Jesus Christ**.
