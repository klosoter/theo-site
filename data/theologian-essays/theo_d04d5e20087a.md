### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Michael Allen emerges as a leading voice in contemporary **Reformed dogmatics**, defined by a self-consciously ecclesial and resourcing posture he terms **Reformed catholicity**. Teaching in the early twenty-first century at **Wheaton College**, **Knox Theological Seminary**, and especially at **Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando**, he writes for pastors and scholars who find themselves between late-modern **postliberalism**, evangelical **biblicism**, and the contested legacy of **Karl Barth**. His career has been joined tightly to institutional projects of retrieval, including co-editing the **New Studies in Dogmatics** series and co-leading the **Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology** published in 2020. The dominant horizon of his work is the renewal of **classical theism** and **confessional Protestantism** through fresh engagement of **Scripture**, **patristic** sources, and **Reformed orthodoxy**.

Allen’s method is what he calls **theological theology**, a phrase indebted to **John Webster**, which accents the Lord as the principium and end of doctrine. In **The Fear of the Lord** from 2024, he distills this stance as reverent reason, a mode of inquiry governed by **Holy Scripture** and holy worship. The grammar is Augustinian and Nicene, with sustained appeal to **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as the conceptual architecture for reading the Bible. He reframes **theological interpretation of Scripture** by grounding it explicitly in the **rule of faith** and the **creedal** and **confessional** inheritance of the church catholic. The programmatic volume **Reformed Catholicity** from 2015, co-authored with **Scott R. Swain**, argues that Protestantism at its best is both reformational and catholic, oriented to the supreme authority of Scripture while receiving **traditio** as a ministerial authority that serves exegesis and sanctifies the theologian’s imagination.

Methodologically, Allen advances a ressourcement of **Reformed scholasticism** not as antiquarianism but as a critical instrument for the church’s present under the living God. He commends **Francis Turretin** and **Herman Bavinck** as masters of a disciplined **Reformed metaphysic** that upholds the **Creator-creature distinction** while speaking responsibly of **participation** and **union with Christ**. The interpretive posture is chastened yet confident. Scripture is read with the **analogia fidei**, according to the whole counsel of God, and within a metaphysical horizon that affirms that names like **goodness** and **wisdom** are predicated of God analogically, avoiding the univocity that dissolves **divine transcendence** and the equivocity that undermines **covenant knowledge**.

#### 2. Doctrine of God and theological exegesis
The dogmatic core of Allen’s project is the doctrine of **God**. Through essays and editorial work collected across volumes such as **Christian Dogmatics** from 2016, he and collaborators defend **classical theism** with renewed exegetical rigor. He retrieves the patristic account of **eternal generation** and upholds **Calvin’s autotheos**, the Son as God-of-himself, integrating Nicene taxis with Reformed insistence on the full aseity of the Son with respect to the divine essence. The result is a careful rendering of **Trinitarian relations** where *ad intra* processions are distinguished from *ad extra* missions, and where the **operations are undivided** yet hypostatically appropriated. He appropriates **Aquinas** on **divine simplicity**, not as a speculative appendage but as a hermeneutical principle governing Scriptural predication, so that every biblical perfection is read as naming the one simple act of God.

Allen’s scriptural method is therefore never generic. He argues in **Reformed Catholicity** that biblical **divine names** and metaphors must be regulated by canon and creed. Narrative and history are real, yet doctrinal formation demands metaphysical clarity about who speaks and acts in the economy. The retrieval of **impassibility** clarifies how the God who is love acts without being passively conditioned, which in turn secures the evangelical meaningfulness of the cross. By framing exegesis within a theology of **simplicity** and **aseity**, Allen resists both historicist reductions and existential flattenings commonly associated with thin **biblicism** or some **postliberal** construals of Scripture. He also commends the church’s **confessions** as rules for reading, arguing that **Westminster** and **Three Forms of Unity** are not extraneous but pedagogical instruments for doctrinal clarity.

#### 3. Justification, sanctification, and means of grace
The soteriological heart of Allen’s contributions appears in **Justification and the Gospel** published in 2013 and in **Sanctification** from 2017. In the former, he surveys and adjudicates disputes around the **New Perspective on Paul**, **Roman Catholic** dialogues, and contemporary **evangelical** confusion about **imputation**. He articulates **justification by faith alone** as a forensic reality grounded in the **obedience of Christ**, given in union with Christ, and distinguished without separation from **sanctification**. The retrieval is not polemics for its own sake but a constructive account of how **union with Christ** integrates the multiple benefits of salvation within a **covenant** frame. He resists reductions that conflate faith and faithfulness, recasts **assurance** as a fruit of union, and locates good works as Spirit-wrought and covenantally necessary though non-meritorious.

In **Sanctification**, he extends this vision by retrieving **definitive sanctification** from **John Murray** and correlating it with progressive renewal by the **Spirit** through the **means of grace**. The work is pastoral and dogmatic, charting the interplay of **mortification** and **vivification**, and presenting ascetical practices as evangelical, not voluntarist. The sacramental economy, with **Word and sacrament** at its center, is presented as the concrete ecology of holiness, wherein the **church** as a visible society bears the gifts that conform saints to Christ. Allen connects sanctification to the doctrine of **God** by insisting that holiness proceeds from a participation in God’s own life, as creatures, sharing by grace what is proper to the Son by nature, a point that rearticulates the **patristic** axiom that God became man that man might be made god, rightly parsed within a Reformed **Creator-creature distinction**.

#### 4. Eschatology, beatific orientation, and catholic breadth
The teleological orientation of Allen’s theology comes into focus in **Grounded in Heaven** from 2015. Here he contests the pragmatic activism of some late-modern **evangelical** theologies and the anti-eschatological immanentism of certain cultural projects by retrieving the **beatific vision** as the apex of Christian hope. Drawing on **Aquinas** and **Bavinck**, he argues that heavenly mindedness deepens earthly faithfulness. The vision of God is not an escape from creation but the perfection of participation, wherein creatures behold **God** and are transfigured in love. This end corrects misaligned emphases in mission, worship, and ethics by recentering the **divine glory** as the telos of life and by maintaining that the ascension lifts the church’s horizon to Christ’s heavenly session.

Allen delivers this eschatology with catholic breadth. His editorial labors in **The Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology** in 2020 curate sources and trajectories that display a wide **Reformed** tradition, spanning **patristic reception**, **scholastic** development, and modern expansions. He construes **Reformed catholicity** as a posture of grateful reception and discriminating discernment, encouraging open engagement with **patristic** and **medieval** authorities without collapsing confessional boundaries. This catholicity is not eclecticism. It proceeds by principled criteria embedded in **Scripture**, **creeds**, and **confessions**, in which the **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **soteriology** remain norming centers.

#### 5. Barth, natural theology, and participation
Allen’s early study **Karl Barth’s Church Dogmatics: An Introduction and Reader** published in 2012 exhibits appreciative yet critical proximity to **Barth**. He honors Barth’s **Christocentrism**, attentiveness to **revelation**, and formal rigor, while querying the adequacy of Barth’s account of **natural theology**, the **analogia entis**, and the stability of divine perfections like **immutability** across economy and theology. Allen aligns more closely with **Webster** and **Bavinck** in insisting that the **perfections** of God named by Scripture are not suspended in the economy but are the very idiom by which God acts toward us. Thus he retrieves **impassibility** and **simplicity** as safeguards for the gospel, maintaining that divine love does not require ontological passibility to be genuinely relational and saving.

A signature feature of Allen’s constructive work is the careful use of **participation**. Against some **Radical Orthodoxy** and certain romanticized accounts, he contends for a **Reformed** account of participation that is covenantal, Christological, and pneumatological, not a metaphysical emanationism. Creatures participate by grace in the life of the **Triune God** through **union with Christ**, receiving by adoption what belongs to the Son by eternal generation. He uses this grammar to coordinate **sanctification**, the **beatific vision**, and the **means of grace**. Yet he is alert to the dangers of leveling the **Creator-creature distinction**, repeatedly invoking **aseity** and **immutability** to mark the asymmetry of the relation.

#### 6. Scripture, tradition, and the church’s learning
Allen’s ecclesial posture is pastoral. In **Reformed Theology** from 2010 and in **Christian Dogmatics** edited in 2016, he outlines a confessional map for catechesis and proclamation. He treats the **Westminster Standards** and other **Reformed confessions** as pedagogical norms that discipline **theological interpretation of Scripture**. The **rule of faith** is not an extrinsic imposition but a Spirit-given means of reading reality in Christ. He insists that the **church** is God’s school and that the theologian is a ministerial servant whose speculative work is answerable to **Word and sacrament**. His advocacy of **retrieval** is therefore liturgically embedded, urging that doctrinal renewal occurs through the church’s ordinary ordinances.

This ecclesial vision translates into pedagogical strategy. As series co-editor of **New Studies in Dogmatics**, Allen sponsors works that retrieve loci such as **Christology**, **Trinity**, and **Scripture** with classical depth and contemporary clarity. The intent is to form ministers and scholars conversant with **Aquinas**, **Augustine**, **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck**, while attentive to modern figures such as **Barth** and **Webster**. The effect has been a re-centering of **classical theism** and **confessional** reasoning in evangelical and Reformed institutions, a shift visible in renewed attention to **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **eternal generation** in seminary curricula and pastoral discourse.

#### 7. Ethics, culture, and the heavenly-politics of holiness
While not primarily an ethicist, Allen’s doctrinal concentration yields an ethic of holiness that is unmistakably **theocentric**. The fear of the Lord, central in **The Fear of the Lord** from 2024, names the posture of wisdom that orders all action to **God** and his **glory**. He thus resists the drift toward functional **moralism** or secular **activism** by rooting ecclesial life in the **means of grace**, where **sanctification** secretes genuine social fruit. His eschatology in **Grounded in Heaven** guards the pilgrim identity of the church, which lives in the world as an embassy of a heavenly country. Engagement with culture and politics is pursued in an order of loves shaped by the **beatific vision**, thereby reforming activism into vocation and witness under the lordship of **Christ**.

Throughout, Allen maintains a seasonal prudence with respect to **natural theology** and **common grace**. He welcomes **general revelation** as confessed in **Reformed orthodoxy**, yet he makes **Scripture** the cognitive principium of dogmatics. He acknowledges that metaphysical and philosophical tools are inevitable, following **Aquinas** and **Bavinck**, but insists that such tools be chastened by the **Creator-creature distinction** and transfigured by the **gospel**. This yields a practice of reason that is participatory and analogical, disciplined by **simplicity** and **aseity**, and oriented to the doxological end of knowing the **Triune God**.

#### 8. Integrative vision and constructive balance
Taken together, Allen’s corpus offers an integrative **Reformed vision** in which **theology proper** sets the horizon for every locus. **Justification** and **sanctification** are rearticulated within **union with Christ** and the **means of grace**. **Eschatology** is reframed by the **beatific vision**, and **Scripture** is read in the key of **confessional** and **creedal** guidance. The economy of salvation is the theater where the simple, impassible, and ase God acts for creatures, a grammar that secures assurance and stability for the church’s proclamation. His **Reformed catholicity** is no slogan. It is a research program and pastoral strategy that situates Protestant confessionalism within the grand tradition, refusing both rancorous sectarianism and easygoing ecumenism.

The effect has been to recalibrate conversations across evangelical and Reformed institutions. Through editorial leadership in the **Oxford Handbook of Reformed Theology** in 2020 and in **New Studies in Dogmatics**, Allen has platformed a cohort committed to **classical theism**, **retrieval**, and **theological interpretation**. His own volumes, from **Reformed Theology** in 2010 to **Sanctification** in 2017 and **The Fear of the Lord** in 2024, constitute a coherent witness to the claim that doctrine is for the doxology of the church. The north star remains God’s **glory**, and the anchor is the **rule of faith** given in **Scripture** and confessed in **creeds**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Allen’s project is substantially aligned with classical commitments to **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **covenant theology**, and **theology proper**. His defense of **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **eternal generation** renews confessional orthodoxy and corrects trends of voluntarism and theistic personalism. His account of **justification** and **sanctification** safeguards **sola fide** while integrating **union with Christ**, and his retrieval of the **means of grace** strengthens ecclesial practice. Two tensions merit note. First, his constructive use of **participation** requires constant policing of the **Creator-creature distinction** to avoid soft ontologism; the **Van Tilian** instinct to stress epistemic and ontological **analogy** can sharpen this boundary while leaving intact Allen’s christological and covenantal gains. Second, his guarded openness to **natural theology** as ministerial tool must be tethered to **Scripture** as principium, lest ratio creep into magisterial status; a **WTS** corrective would be to reiterate that all theological predication be explicitly indexed to **special revelation** and the **covenant** economy. With those calibrations, Allen’s **Reformed catholicity** models a principled, confessional ressourcement that many in the **Westminster** tradition will rightly receive as both faithful and fruitful.
