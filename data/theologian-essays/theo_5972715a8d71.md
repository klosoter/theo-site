### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Evgeny Morozov, a Belarusian-born critic shaped by **post-Soviet transitions** and **Eastern European civil society**, emerged in the late 2000s as a leading voice against the triumphalism of **internet freedom** and **Silicon Valley modernity**. His early work with digital activists and policy institutes during the **Web 2.0** wave positioned him at the fault line where **liberal internationalism** met **authoritarian resilience**. From the outset, he refused the binaries of **technological determinism** and **technological pessimism**, adopting a hybrid method that combines **genealogical critique** in the spirit of **Michel Foucault**, **science and technology studies** associated with **Bruno Latour** and **Langdon Winner**, and **political economy** indebted to **Karl Polanyi**. He scrutinizes the moral vocabulary of digital culture, arguing that categories like **openness**, **innovation**, and **efficiency** function as a secular **soteriology** of progress. His method is diagnostic and polemical, attending to the *telos* of institutions and to how **platform infrastructures** configure power. The wager is simple and radical: technology is a matter of **political design**, not destiny, and the answer to technical drift is **democratic governance of infrastructures**.

#### 2. The Net Delusion 2011 and the demolition of cyber-utopianism
With **The Net Delusion** 2011, Morozov delivers a frontal assault on **cyber-utopianism** and its twin, **internet-centrism**, the belief that connectivity by itself promotes **democracy** and **freedom**. Reading the aftermath of **Iran's 2009 Green Movement**, the experiences of **Russia** and **Belarus**, and the mixed legacy of the **Arab Spring**, he argues that authoritarian regimes adapt quickly, integrating **social media** into apparatuses of **surveillance**, **censorship**, and **propaganda**. The state he calls the **spinternet** marshals memes, trolls, and data mining to subvert activists' reliance on platforms. Against simplistic claims that the net routes around control, he offers the sober thesis that the net amplifies whatever institutional power is already operative. The book's strategic target is the doctrine of **technological determinism** that blinds policymakers to contingent design choices. Its constructive implication is the need for **institutional checks**, **legal safeguards**, and **civic capacity** that recognize the political malleability of digital systems. In theological terms, the book disenchants a secular **theology of progress**, exposing a misplaced **soteriological** faith in networks to redeem politics.

#### 3. To Save Everything, Click Here 2013 and the critique of solutionism
Morozov's second book, **To Save Everything, Click Here** 2013, coins his signature critique of **technological solutionism**, the disposition to convert complex social and moral problems into tractable engineering puzzles demanding optimization. He dissects **smart city** platforms, **quantified self** movements, **nudging** and **gamification**, **open government** portals, and **prediction markets**, showing how they smuggle in a thin anthropology and a truncated **moral economy**. For him, **internet-centrism** ascribes disproportionate causal weight to the web while masking political judgments as neutral computation. By reducing the *telos* of institutions to efficiency and the *lex* of social order to code, solutionism erases the goods internal to practices that resist quantification. He argues for the value of **friction**, **opacity**, and **institutional pluralism** against the cult of seamlessness. Theologically read, this is a critique of **Pelagian anthropology** in digital guise, where moral failure is framed as information deficit and salvation arrives as better feedback loops. Morozov calls readers back to the slow arts of **deliberation**, **contestation**, and **judgment**, insisting that liberal societies should nurture the virtues proper to political life, not outsource them to **algorithms**.

#### 4. From polemic to program: planning, sovereignty, and the public stack
After demolishing the myths of **cyber-utopianism** and **solutionism**, Morozov turns to constructive questions of **technological sovereignty** and **public infrastructure**. In the essay **The Planning Machine** 2014, he excavates **Project Cybersyn** in 1970s Chile under **Salvador Allende** and **Stafford Beer**, exploring cybernetic feedback as a tool for democratic planning. He returns to interwar debates between **Oskar Lange** and **Friedrich Hayek** over the knowledge problem, insisting that contemporary computation reframes old disputes about **planning** and **markets**. Across articles, talks, and reports, he advocates building a **public stack** of cloud, data, identity, payments, and logistics under democratic control, a structural alternative to **platform capitalism**. He calls for **data trusts** and **data commons** that embed public purpose, and he links **municipal platforms** to broader **industrial policy**. These proposals reveal a normative horizon where the *oeconomia* of the digital is folded back into the **polis**, guided by public law rather than venture capital mandates. The pivot from critique to design marks his admission that dismantling the idol of **techno-solutionism** requires institutional successors capable of ordering innovation toward plural goods.

#### 5. Digital Socialism 2019, surveillance capitalism, and infrastructural reform
The essay **Digital Socialism?** 2019 consolidates Morozov's program. He contends that advances in **machine learning**, **sensors**, and **distributed computing** blunt the classic Hayekian objection to planning by radically reducing the costs of **discovery** and **coordination**. Drawing on **Karl Polanyi** and late **cybernetic** traditions, he treats digitization as an opportunity for a renewed settlement that re-embeds markets in democratic institutions. He disputes **Shoshana Zuboff's surveillance capitalism** thesis where it functions primarily as moral sociology, arguing for a more structural account that highlights **infrastructure**, **supply chains**, **cloud monopolies**, and **geopolitics**. In his view, the remedy is not privacy moralism but the **socialization of critical infrastructures**, from **cloud computing** to **payment rails**, achieved through **public procurement**, **standards**, and **state capacity**. He emphasizes **technological sovereignty** for the **European Union** and the Global South, resisting dependency on American or Chinese stacks. Where many critics personalize blame in **Mark Zuckerberg** or fetishize deletion, Morozov redirects attention to the **political economy of platforms**, the mundane levers of ownership, finance, and regulation that determine the horizon of possible futures.

#### 6. Interlocutors, polemics, and the rhetoric of demystification
Morozov's antagonists and allies map a wide field. Against **Friedrich Hayek** he argues that digital feedback can inform **democratic planning**, while learning from **Elinor Ostrom** how **commons governance** can scale through polycentric design. With **Michel Foucault** he traces the **governmentality** of data-driven nudging, though he refuses a fatalism that would render power omnipotent. In conversation with **Bruno Latour** and **Langdon Winner** he treats artifacts as bearers of politics, insisting that design choices inscribe **normative orders**. He pushes back on **Shoshana Zuboff** where her **surveillance capitalism** fixates on behavioral extraction yet under-theorizes public alternatives. He engages **Jaron Lanier** and **Lawrence Lessig** on ownership and code, while criticizing **techno-libertarians** such as **Peter Thiel** for market eschatologies. His rhetoric is epideictic and forensic at once, staging **genealogies of key words** like smart, open, and sharing to expose their liturgies. The point is not mere unmasking but a summons to institutional craft, where **public law**, **standards bodies**, and **civic technics** reclaim the future.

#### 7. Moral anthropology and the politics of limits
Running through Morozov's oeuvre is an implicit anthropology. **Technological solutionism** presumes transparent agents and frictionless coordination, then treats deviation as error to be debugged. Morozov replies with a defense of **moral opacity**, **institutional friction**, and **bounded rationality**, a modesty that refuses to compress all goods to optimization. He locates the dignity of politics in its non-instrumental goods, honoring the plurality of *teloi* that preserve **associational life**, **professional practices**, and **civic virtues**. The critique of **internet-centrism** thus becomes a defense of **subsidiarity** and **institutional differentiation**, even where he does not use that name. His vision of **data commons** and a **public stack** seeks not the abolition of markets but their embedding in a constitutional order that regulates accumulation and orients innovation to shared ends. He views **privacy**, **competition**, and **consumer choice** as insufficient master concepts, trading instead in the grammar of **social rights**, **public purpose**, and **republican liberty** reimagined for the platform age.

#### 8. Platforms, sovereignty, and the long arc of institutional imagination
Morozov's later projects broaden his historical canvas. With **The Syllabus** 2019 he curates global scholarship, seeking a counter-public of critical research to contest **techno-hype**. In **The Santiago Boys** 2023 he narrates the political theology of **Project Cybersyn**, connecting **Stafford Beer's cybernetics** to the dilemmas of sovereignty and planning under dependency. These works deepen his conviction that **infrastructure is destiny**, and that the heart of our crisis is less content moderation than control of **clouds**, **chips**, and **logistics**. He calls for **industrial policy** and **public procurement** as the liturgy of statecraft by which political communities inscribe their priorities into code and concrete. What he refuses is both the nihilism that treats platforms as irresistible **principalities** and the naïveté that hopes for reform through CEO virtue. He seeks instead a regime of **technological sovereignty** anchored by democratic mandates and secured through institutional design that binds capital to **public law**.

#### 9. Theology by other means: idolatry, hamartiology, and eschatology
Although he is not a theologian, Morozov's grammar touches classic dogmatic loci. His polemic against **solutionism** rebukes a technocratic **soteriology** that promises redemption by optimization, a secular **eschatology** of frictionless futures with no place for tragedy. His demolition of **cyber-utopianism** aligns with a robust **hamartiology**, foregrounding the plasticity of power and the **noetic effects** of interest that warp even well-designed systems. His constructive call for **public stacks**, **data commons**, and **technological sovereignty** names a doctrine of the **polis** where authority is answerable to a people and not to opaque investors. He grants that institutions must be disciplined by **law**, **virtue**, and **prudence**, and that design is never apolitical. If one sought a theological analogue, his program resists **idolatry of technique**, deflates **Babel-like pretensions**, and summons a patient **ethos of stewardship** in the governance of our common technical life.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed standpoint, Morozov offers salutary correctives and invites principled dissent. His exposure of **technological idolatry** and **solutionist Pelagianism** resonates with the doctrines of **total depravity** and the **antithesis**, reminding the church that no technique can expel sin or abolish the need for **law** and **gospel**. His insistence that infrastructures must be subject to **public accountability** harmonizes with **covenantal stewardship** and with a robust **doctrine of vocation** that dignifies institutional craft under Christ's lordship. Yet his confidence in **computational planning**, **state capacity**, and the **socialization of infrastructures** risks eliding the Reformed insights of **two-kingdoms prudence** and **sphere sovereignty**, which warn against the absorption of family, church, school, and enterprise into a monistic public project. A Reformed alternative would join his critique of **platform capitalism** to a polycentric program of **subsidiarity**, integrating **municipal ownership**, **cooperative enterprise**, and **constitutional limits** that check both state and market under the supremacy of **public right** before God. Morozov's telos of democratic control is a fitting penultimate good; the ultimate horizon remains the **kingdom of Christ**, which relativizes all technics and bids us weigh every design by the measure of **justice**, **mercy**, and **humility** in history's already-not yet.
