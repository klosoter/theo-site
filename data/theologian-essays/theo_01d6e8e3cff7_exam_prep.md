### TITLE
Richard B. Gaffin Jr. secures union-with-Christ, resurrection, and Pentecost at the center of Reformed soteriology and ecclesiology, while sharpening but not overturning classic confessional categories.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late twentieth century **Reformed** theologian, teaching at **Westminster Theological Seminary** from the late 1960s into the early 2000s, shaped by **Vosian biblical theology** and the postwar **neo-evangelical** debates.
- Works in the context of the **OPC** and conservative **Presbyterian** confessionalism, responding to the **Lutheran-Reformed** law-gospel controversy, the **New Perspective on Paul**, and charismatic renewal movements.

- Methodologically he is a self-conscious **Van Tilian** who insists on the principial priority of **special revelation** and the antithesis in epistemology while integrating redemptive-historical exegesis.
- He practices a *Scripture-principle* **biblical theology** in the line of **Geerhardus Vos**, subordinating philosophical systems to exegesis and the **Reformed confessions**.
- He emphasizes the eschatological and redemptive-historical structure of **revelation** and **history**, arguing that theology must be normed by the once-for-all events of **Christ**, resurrection, and **Pentecost**.

- In **Resurrection and Redemption** (1978) he argues that the resurrection of Christ is the climactic redemptive-historical event in which justification, adoption, and sanctification are secured in the **eschatological Spirit**.
- In **Perspectives on Pentecost** (1979) he defends the once-for-all character of **Pentecost** and the apostolic age against modern **Pentecostal** and charismatic claims.
- In **By Faith, Not by Sight** (2006, rev. ed. 2013) he expounds **union with Christ** and *ordo salutis* as realized in an eschatological *historia salutis*, pressing back against versions of the **New Perspective on Paul**.
- In **Calvin and the Sabbath** (1998) he offers a historical-theological retrieval of **Calvin** on the fourth commandment and the **Lord s Day**, arguing for continuity with Reformed confessional **Sabbath** doctrine.

- He is most decisive for the loci of **soteriology** and **union with Christ**, particularly justification and sanctification in relation to the resurrection.
- He significantly shapes Reformed **pneumatology** and **ecclesiology** through his defense of Pentecost as unrepeatable and the **apostolate** as foundational.
- He contributes to **hermeneutics** and **Scripture** doctrine through his work on **biblical theology**, exegesis, and the role of redemptive history in theological method.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to present him as a constructive **Reformed confessional** theologian whose work on **union with Christ** safeguards justification while still needing careful framing on law and gospel.
- Examiners will also want you to note his **anti-charismatic** and **anti-New Perspective** polemics as model examples of confessional engagement with contemporary debates.

- For comparison on union and justification think **Luther vs Calvin** on ordo salutis, and more recently **Gaffin vs Horton** or **Gaffin vs Piper** on justification and union.
- For biblical-theological method and history-of-redemption issues connect **Gaffin vs Vos** on continuity, and **Gaffin vs Pentecostalism** on **Spirit** and redemptive history.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Richard B. **Gaffin** was born in 1936 and educated at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia, where he would later teach for decades in the fields of New Testament and biblical theology. Formed directly by **Cornelius Van Til**, **John Murray**, and especially **Geerhardus Vos**, he embodies the postwar Westminster tradition that sought to integrate confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** with a robust redemptive-historical hermeneutic. He ministered in the orbit of the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** and participated in the ongoing defense of the **Westminster Standards** in a theological climate marked by neo-orthodoxy, the rise of **neo-evangelicalism**, and the new biblical theologies of **Oscar Cullmann** and **Ridderbos**. These historical and ecclesial ties mean that his work is never free-floating academic biblical studies; it is the exegetical and theological labor of a churchman intent on defending confessional **Presbyterianism**.

The driving problem of **Gaffin s** theology is how to hold together, within a consistently redemptive-historical and confessional framework, the unity of salvation in Christ with the distinct benefits of that salvation, especially **justification** and **sanctification**, in such a way that neither Lutheran nor neo-evangelical dichotomies fracture the gospel. Influenced by **Vosian** emphasis on eschatology and history, his fundamental question becomes how the once-for-all events of the **death and resurrection** of Christ, together with **Pentecost**, structure both the ordo salutis and the life of the church. At the same time, he confronts the charismatic and **Pentecostal** claim that post-apostolic Christians should expect a second-stage baptism in the Spirit, and he confronts the **New Perspective on Paul** which threatens a forensic and imputed understanding of righteousness. In this way, his oeuvre can be read as one long attempt to answer the question: how do **union with Christ**, eschatological **Spirit**-gift, and classic Reformed forensic soteriology cohere within the one history of redemption.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically, **Gaffin** is unambiguously a child of **Van Til** and **Vos**. From Van Til he adopts a principled commitment to the self-attesting authority of **Scripture**, the Creator creature distinction, and the antithesis in epistemology. From Vos he appropriates the conviction that special **revelation** is intrinsically historical and eschatological, culminating in Christ and interpreted canonically. As a result, **revelation** for Gaffin is primarily the once-for-all deed-word complex of the triune God in the history centered on Christ, recorded and interpreted in the written Word. He is allergic to any concept of revelation as bare religious experience or as timeless truth accessible apart from the redemptive-historical unfolding of **covenant** history.

Reason, for **Gaffin**, is a created capacity used by regenerate image bearers in dependence on **Scripture** and the illumination of the **Holy Spirit**, never a neutral arbiter above revelation. He follows **Van Til** in rejecting natural theology understood as an autonomous enterprise, while affirming that general revelation renders all humans inexcusable before God. Experience, particularly religious experience, is significant but always subordinate; in **Perspectives on Pentecost** he stresses that authentic Christian experience of the **Spirit** is derivative from and shaped by the once-for-all Pentecost event, not a norm by which that event is measured. The **church** is the Spirit-indwelt community that receives, preserves, and proclaims the Word, and he consistently operates in confessional solidarity with the **Reformed** tradition, especially the Westminster Standards.

History for **Gaffin** is not a neutral sequence but the arena of God s unfolding **kingdom** and eschatological purposes. In **Resurrection and Redemption** he insists that exegesis must reckon with Paul s eschatological two-age schema and the already not yet structure of redemptive history. This historical consciousness leads him to integrate biblical theology with dogmatics, so that loci like **justification** or **sanctification** cannot be abstracted from the historia salutis. In doing so, he resists any repristination of a purely ordo salutis system that would treat the application of redemption as a sequence of timeless states located in the individual. The tension with some forms of classical Reformed method is not a rejection of **Turretin** or **Calvin**, but a recalibration: he wants to read them through the lens of Vosian biblical theology so that **systematic theology** is recognizably dogmatic yet self-consciously historical and eschatological.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **soteriology** and union with Christ, the classic Reformed baseline is that the elect receive all benefits of salvation in union with Christ, and that **justification** is a definitive forensic act on the basis of Christ s imputed righteousness alone, while **sanctification** is a distinct yet inseparable grace of renewal. **Gaffin** radicalizes the centering of union with Christ by insisting that every benefit, including justification, is located in the believer s participation in Christ s death and resurrection in the power of the **Spirit**. In **Resurrection and Redemption** and **By Faith, Not by Sight**, he argues that Paul is fundamentally an eschatological theologian whose ordo salutis is an outworking of the historia salutis, that is, the once-for-all resurrection and exaltation of Christ. Interlocutors include **Lutheran** two-benefit schemes that isolate justification as the gospel, as well as Reformed voices like **Michael Horton** and **John Piper** who he worries may functionally separate justification from union. His thesis is not that justification is non-forensic, but that its forensic nature is inseparable from the believer s incorporation into the resurrected Christ, an incorporation that also entails definitive and progressive sanctification. The potential tension point here is whether his union-first formulation undercuts the traditional logical priority of justification; he insists it does not, but examiners will expect clarity.

Second, in the locus of **pneumatology** and Pentecost, the Reformed baseline holds that the Holy **Spirit** is the third person of the Trinity, equal in power and glory, who applies the work of Christ to the elect, and that the extraordinary gifts attached to the apostolate ceased with the close of the canon. In **Perspectives on Pentecost** **Gaffin** defends the once-for-all, non-repeatable character of Pentecost as a stage in redemptive history equivalent in importance to the incarnation, death, and resurrection of Christ. He argues that the baptism with the Spirit is not a second blessing subsequent to conversion but identical with the fundamental gift of salvation in union with Christ, received by faith at conversion. His opponents here are classical **Pentecostal** and neo-charismatic theologians who posit a post-conversion baptism and norm ecstatic gifts like tongues as ongoing for the whole church. Drawing on **Acts** and **Pauline** epistles, he argues that the tongues events are tied to redemptive-historical transitions and that the apostolic office is foundational and unique. This work has become a standard confessionally Reformed critique of continuationism and provides a biblical-theological grounding for cessationist instincts consistent with the **Westminster Confession**.

Third, in the locus of **hermeneutics**, Scripture, and biblical theology, the classic Reformed baseline is that **Scripture** is the inspired, inerrant Word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and life, and that its unity is covenantal and Christocentric. **Gaffin**, following **Vos**, insists that Scripture must be interpreted with sharp attention to its redemptive-historical progression and eschatological structure. In his essays on **biblical theology** and in classroom teaching later collected in volumes like **Redemptive History and Biblical Interpretation** by Vos which he edited, he presses that dogmatics must be tethered to exegesis that respects the unfolding of special revelation from promise to fulfillment. He opposes both higher critical fragmentation of the canon and biblicist flattening that disregards historical progression. Interlocutors include older forms of **dispensationalism**, which he regards as insufficiently Christocentric and covenantal, and also certain evangelical hermeneutical approaches that treat the Bible as a repository of timeless principles rather than as an organic **covenant** history culminating in Christ. His contribution is to make redemptive-historical exegesis the regular currency of Reformed theological work without displacing systematic formulation.

Fourth, in the locus of **ecclesiology** and Sabbath, the confessional baseline is that Christ has instituted an apostolic foundation for the **church** and that the moral law, including the fourth commandment, continues to bind believers, now expressed in the Christian Sabbath or Lord s Day. In **Calvin and the Sabbath** **Gaffin** offers a historical and constructive reading of **Calvin** and later Reformed tradition on the Sabbath, arguing that Calvin is more aligned with confessional Sabbath doctrine than some have suggested. He stresses the eschatological orientation of the Lord s Day as a sign of the new creation rest inaugurated in Christ s resurrection, and he shows how Calvin integrates moral and ceremonial aspects of the commandment. His dialogue partners here include **T. F. Torrance** and others who portray Calvin as largely spiritualizing the Sabbath. For **Gaffin**, a robust, eschatologically framed Sabbath doctrine guards both the freedom of the gospel and the abiding validity of God s law, reinforcing a Reformed vision of churchly life in time. This work displays his characteristic pattern: reading a classical Reformed figure through a redemptive-historical and eschatological lens to reinforce, not weaken, confessional commitments.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
In relation to classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, **Gaffin** consciously stands in continuity with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, **Bavinck**, **Vos**, and **Van Til**. From Calvin and Turretin he receives the core doctrinal content: the Trinity, the two natures of Christ, forensic justification by imputed righteousness, and the covenant theology enshrined in the **Westminster Standards**. From **Bavinck** and **Vos** he gains a synthetic vision in which those doctrines are organically related within the history of **covenant** revelation. His emphasis on union with Christ is thoroughly Calvinian, and his closing of the canon and cessation of the apostolate reflect classic Reformed views of the sufficiency of **Scripture**. His defense of the Sabbath and the moral law likewise harmonizes with **Reformed scholastic** teaching.

At the same time, Westminster examiners will identify certain pressure points. One is the way **Gaffin** articulates the relation of union with Christ and **justification**. There has been concern, illustrated in debates with figures like **Norman Shepherd** and more recently around Federal Vision thinkers, that an appeal to union could blur the categorical forensic distinction of justification and open the door to a more participatory or transformational understanding. While **Gaffin** publicly distanced himself from Shepherd s formulations and has clearly affirmed forensic justification, examiners will want the candidate to say that justification remains a distinct act of God s **imputation**, logically prior within union, and not simply a function of sanctification. A second pressure point is his sometimes sharp contrast between a redemptive-historical and an ordo salutis approach; here Reformed orthodoxy would insist that the classic ordo, properly understood, is already grounded in historia salutis, so the contrast must be carefully nuanced rather than absolutized.

Positively, Reformed theologians can learn from **Gaffin** the centrality of **eschatology** to every locus and the indispensability of rigorous exegesis. His resurrection-centered soteriology corrects a functional cross-only reductionism, reminding us that the New Testament consistently points to the resurrection and exaltation of Christ as the climactic saving event. His work on **Pentecost** offers a clear framework for engaging charismatic theology without denying the present work of the Spirit, and his insistence on the unity of the work of the triune God in history guards against fragmented anthropocentric readings of Scripture. His reception in conservative Reformed circles has therefore been largely appreciative, with his work on union and Pentecost functioning as standard references, even among those who nuance certain formulations differently.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, safe opening sentences about **Gaffin** would highlight his confessional and biblical-theological commitments. A candidate can safely say, Richard B. **Gaffin Jr.** is a Westminster New Testament scholar who, in the line of **Vos** and **Van Til**, has labored to show that union with Christ in his death and resurrection is the eschatological center of Reformed soteriology. Likewise, one can affirm, For Gaffin, Pentecost is a once-for-all redemptive-historical event that secures the Spirit for the church and closes the apostolic era, not a repeatable second blessing. These sentences situate him as a friend, not a foe, of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**, while naming his distinctive emphases.

There are, however, phrases that must be carefully qualified. You should avoid saying that for **Gaffin** union with Christ is logically prior to **justification** in a way that relativizes justification, or that justification is simply a dimension of union without its own forensic integrity. Examiners may press whether such language sound like **Shepherd** or Federal Vision. It is better to say, He argues that all benefits, including justification, are received only in union with Christ, yet within that union justification remains the distinct forensic verdict that grounds the believer s status before God. You should also avoid loose talk about an already-not-yet *transformative* view of justification; **Gaffin** firmly holds to a definitive, once-for-all verdict, even as the believer s resurrection life is progressively manifested in sanctification. Likewise, when speaking of **Spirit** baptism, do not grant Pentecostal categories such as second blessing or normative tongues; instead, echo his language that the baptism with the Spirit is coextensive with salvation and union with Christ.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the idea that **Gaffin** collapses **ordo salutis** into historia salutis or that he denies any legitimate ordo. You should note that he critiques an abstract, de-historicized ordo, but he does not reject the need to distinguish calling, justification, and sanctification as applied to individuals. Another misunderstanding is that he is simply a cessationist polemicist against charismatic gifts; you should clarify that he grounds his cessationism not in a mere proof-texting, but in a deep biblical-theological reading of **Acts** and **Ephesians**, where the apostolic foundation is unique and non-repeatable. Finally, some may think his emphasis on **eschatology** risks underplaying Christ s prior humiliation; here you can stress that for him the resurrection is the vindication and fruit of the cross, not a rival to it, and that his thesis in **Resurrection and Redemption** is that Paul s doctrine of salvation can only be understood from the vantage point of the resurrected and exalted Christ. Demonstrating this nuance will reassure a Westminster committee that you grasp both his contributions and their confessional boundaries.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, **Gaffin** is a largely exemplary Reformed theologian whose work on **union with Christ**, resurrection, and Pentecost deepens rather than displaces the **Westminster Confession**, so we gladly affirm his insistence that the whole ordo salutis is rooted in the once-for-all historia salutis of Christ s death, resurrection, and exaltation, and that the baptism with the **Spirit** at Pentecost is unrepeatable and foundational for the church; at the same time, we must deny any formulation of union that could blur the forensic distinctness and logical priority of justification by the imputed righteousness of Christ alone or that could be co-opted by Shepherd or Federal Vision trajectories, and we must resist any overdrawn contrast between redemptive-historical and systematic ordo salutis approaches, so if asked where we land we would say that we stand with **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and **Vos** in affirming a union-with-Christ-centered soteriology in which justification retains its confessional status as a definitive forensic act, received by faith alone, within the Spirit-wrought union that also yields definitive and progressive sanctification in the one people of God until the consummation.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Richard B. **Gaffin Jr.** is a Westminster New Testament theologian who, in the line of **Vos** and **Van Til**, centers Reformed soteriology on union with the resurrected Christ and the once-for-all gift of the Spirit at **Pentecost**.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1936, long-time professor at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia, ministering within the **OPC** and confessional Presbyterianism.
- **Resurrection and Redemption** (1978) and **Perspectives on Pentecost** (1979) frame his mature positions on soteriology, resurrection, and Spirit baptism.
- **By Faith, Not by Sight** (2006, rev. 2013) and **Calvin and the Sabbath** (1998) extend his work on **union with Christ**, justification, and the Lord s Day.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- He follows a **Van Tilian** epistemology where **Scripture** as special revelation is self-attesting, normative, and interpreted within the Creator creature distinction.
- He practices **Vosian biblical theology**, treating **revelation** as intrinsically historical and eschatological, culminating in Christ and the closure of canon.
- He subordinates experience and reason to the Word and the **church s** confessions, while integrating exegesis, redemptive history, and systematic theology.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- He argues in **Resurrection and Redemption** that Paul s soteriology is structured by the eschatological resurrection of **Christ**, not by abstract ordo categories.
- He contends that all saving benefits, including **justification**, are received only in **union with Christ**, yet insists justification remains a distinct forensic act.
- He maintains in **Perspectives on Pentecost** that the baptism with the **Spirit** at Pentecost is once-for-all, not a repeatable second blessing for believers.
- He upholds a cessationist reading of apostolic **gifts**, tying tongues and prophecy to the foundational, non-repeatable **apostolate** and canon formation.
- He interprets the **Sabbath** and Lord s Day in **Calvin and the Sabbath** as an eschatological sign of new creation rest, in continuity with Reformed confessions.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Examiners will press whether his union-with-Christ emphasis ever threatens the confessional clarity of forensic **justification by imputed righteousness alone**.
- They will ask if his critique of abstract **ordo salutis** wrongly relativizes classic Reformed formulations found in **Turretin** and the Westminster standards.
- They may probe whether his strong cessationism about extraordinary **gifts** adequately accounts for the ongoing, experiential work of the **Spirit** in believers.
- They will want assurance that his redemptive-historical method does not marginalize catholic dogmatic categories in favor of purely historical description.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Calvin vs Luther** on the centrality of **union with Christ** for justification and sanctification helps situate Gaffin s soteriology.
- **Vos vs classic Reformed scholastics** on biblical theology and **redemptive history** frames his method in relation to orthodoxy.
- **Gaffin vs Pentecostalism** on **Spirit baptism** and gifts highlights his once-for-all Pentecost and cessationist stance.
- **Gaffin vs New Perspective on Paul** on **justification** clarifies his defense of forensic imputation against covenantal nomism and ecclesial re-readings.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Richard B. **Gaffin Jr.** should be received as a faithful Reformed theologian whose union-with-Christ and resurrection emphasis enriches Westminster s system when tethered explicitly to the confessional doctrine of forensic justification by faith alone.
