### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the search for responsible rationality
Born in 1942 in South Africa, **J. Wentzel van Huyssteen** matured as a theologian within a Dutch Reformed ecclesial and intellectual milieu shadowed by apartheid and the wider crisis of late modernity. His early teaching in South Africa and later appointment as the **James I. McCord Professor of Theology and Science** at **Princeton Theological Seminary** positioned him between ecclesial theology and the natural sciences, and also between continental hermeneutics and Anglo-American philosophy of science. Van Huyssteen absorbed the post-Kuhnian critique of scientific **foundationalism**, reading **Thomas Kuhn** on paradigms, **Imre Lakatos** on research programmes, and **Michael Polanyi** on tacit knowledge, while drawing on **Paul Ricoeur** for narrative hermeneutics and **Calvin O. Schrag** for communicative and transversal rationality. In that composite context he identified a central problem for **philosophical theology**: how to show that Christian commitments can be rationally warranted and publicly responsible without capitulating to Enlightenment **foundationalism** or dissolving into postmodern **nonfoundationalism**.

#### 2. Method against the false binary of foundations and relativism
Van Huyssteen’s signature contribution is a carefully articulated **postfoundationalist rationality**, which rejects both ahistorical universal foundations and sheer perspectival relativism. Against classical **foundationalism**, he argues that theology, like the sciences, is theory-laden, traditioned, and historically embedded. Against postmodern **nonfoundationalism**, he insists that there are shared **epistemic virtues** and cross-disciplinary standards that allow for rational accountability. His proposal of **transversal rationality** names the space where multiple disciplines intersect through analogous, not identical, criteria and practices. In this transversal space, warrants arise through the coherence of multiple lines of evidence, the consilience of arguments, the fecundity of explanations, and the capacity to withstand critical scrutiny by relevant communities. This yields a model of **public theology** that is neither triumphalist nor privatist, committed to the integrity of **Christian doctrine** while open to mutual illumination with the empirical sciences.

#### 3. Early works and the shaping of a coherentist realism
The conceptual scaffold for this method is visible already in **Theology and the Justification of Faith** from 1989 and in his South African essays on **critical realism** and the nature of tradition-embedded rationality. Van Huyssteen appropriates **Lakatos** to argue that theology articulates research programmes guided by hard-core convictions and protective footnotes, while experimental results correspond to doctrinal developments and pastoral practice. From **Polanyi** he learns that both science and theology are animated by personal yet responsible commitments, a **fiduciary framework** that is neither arbitrary nor purely subjective. From **Ricoeur** he adopts a hermeneutic of affirmation through suspicion, naming a second naivete that respects the text’s surplus of meaning while resisting ideological capture. The result is a chastened **coherentism** within **critical realism**, where truth is approached through interpretive triangulation rather than secured by indubitable foundations. Here van Huyssteen begins to frame **theology-and-science** as a single discursive field with many languages, mediated by the shared goods of intelligibility and responsible explanation.

#### 4. Essays in postfoundationalist theology and the articulation of transversality
In **Essays in Postfoundationalist Theology** 1997 and **The Shaping of Rationality** 1999, van Huyssteen coins and elaborates **transversal rationality** as the heart of his program. Drawing explicitly on **Calvin O. Schrag** and dialoguing with **Ian Barbour** and **Arthur Peacocke**, he distances his approach from both integrationist harmonization and separatist models such as **Stephen Jay Gould’s** nonoverlapping magisteria. The transversal model proposes that rational dialogue occurs where problems, interpretive strategies, and standards intersect, without presuming a neutral metalanguage. For theology this means that **doctrines** are not constructed by capitulation to science, yet they are accountable to empirical insights where appropriate. Van Huyssteen’s list of **epistemic virtues** becomes prominent here, including coherence, scope, simplicity, consilience, and fecundity, understood as family resemblance criteria shared across inquiry. The pay-off is a methodological toolkit for **public theology** that aims at genuinely interdisciplinary reasoning without erasing the irreducible body of **Christian confession**.

#### 5. Duet or Duel and the postmodern turn without relativism
With **Duet or Duel? Theology and Science in a Postmodern World** 1998, van Huyssteen addresses the anxiety that postmodern critique has destroyed rationality. He argues that **postmodernism**, rightly construed, chastens rational hubris and dislodges naive **foundationalism**, yet it does not demand epistemic despair. He draws on **Ricoeur’s** hermeneutics and **Habermas’** communicative rationality to craft a dialogical account of truth-seeking that is always situated, always corrigible, and always communal. Against the temptation to reduce faith to private language, he accents **public theology** as ecclesially rooted but academically conversant. Against the temptation to enthrone scientific naturalism, he presses for **critical realism** that leaves space for metaphysical and theological explanation where warranted. The implied doctrine of **revelation** is nonpositivist and mediated through interpretive communities, yet it aspires to truth claims that can be argued across boundaries through shared **epistemic virtues**.

#### 6. Gifford Lectures and a theological anthropology in conversation with the sciences
The 2004 **Gifford Lectures** at Edinburgh, published as **Alone in the World? Human Uniqueness in Science and Theology** 2006, represent van Huyssteen’s most substantial constructive foray. There he stages a bidirectional engagement between **theological anthropology** and **paleoanthropology**, **cognitive science**, and **evolutionary psychology**. The question of **human uniqueness** is handled through evidence for symbolic behavior, language, moral awareness, aesthetic imagination, and the emergence of religious practices in the deep past. The theological correlate is a reconstrual of the **imago Dei** as embodied relationality and responsible freedom, expressed in creativity, empathy, and moral accountability. Van Huyssteen resists both reductive naturalism that flattens the imago into neural correlates and disembodied spiritualisms that ignore evolutionary continuity. He argues that the **imago Dei** names a complex of capacities and relations that can be empirically traced in hominin development and theologically oriented toward **communion with God**. This represents a sustained application of **transversal rationality**, where theological claims are refined through scientific conversation without surrendering their confessional depth.

#### 7. Public reason, natural theology, and the scope of interdisciplinarity
On the larger canvas, van Huyssteen’s work reframes **natural theology** under the rubrics of **postfoundationalist rationality** and **public theology**. He resists both a priori proofs for God and an insular fideism, preferring a cumulative, abductive style of argument that honors **critical realism** and the disclosive power of phenomena. Here the epistemic language of consilience and explanatory scope signals kinship with scientific practice, while the appeal to narrative coherence and symbolic depth shows kinship with hermeneutics. Van Huyssteen’s notion of **transversality** functions as a regulative ideal for interdisciplinary engagement, not as a master key. The integrity of **Christian doctrine** remains grounded in the canonical Scriptures and the church’s tradition, yet it remains accountable to what he calls the broader community of inquirers. This balancing act often makes his work a bridge between those shaped by **Barbour’s** typologies and those wary of any integration, offering a nimble, dialogical mode of rationality that refuses both isolation and syncretism.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and contested edges
Van Huyssteen’s debate with **Alvin Plantinga** over **Reformed Epistemology** is instructive. He appreciates Plantinga’s rehabilitation of rational Christian belief yet questions whether **properly basic beliefs** can shoulder the burden of **public theology**. He prefers **transversal rationality**, where warrants emerge from shared **epistemic virtues** rather than from internal doxastic structures alone. He also converses with **Nancey Murphy** on **nonreductive physicalism**, with **Arthur Peacocke** and **John Polkinghorne** on the theological implications of cosmology and evolution, and with **Wolfhart Pannenberg** on the public character of theology. Critics charge that his method risks subordinating **revelation** to interdisciplinary consensus and that his account of **sin** and the noetic effects of the fall is too thin for a fully Augustinian anthropology. Van Huyssteen responds by doubling down on **fallibilism** and the **fiduciary** character of all inquiry, insisting that Christian communities can be both confessional and publicly accountable. The resulting portrait is one of a cautious yet confident **critical realism** that wagers on the intelligibility of reality under **providence**.

#### 9. Contributions, limits, and the shape of a legacy
Taken as a whole, van Huyssteen’s oeuvre leaves three lasting contributions. First, the formal achievement of **postfoundationalist rationality** and **transversal rationality** supplies an alternative to both Enlightenment certainty and postmodern indifference, enabling **public theology** to work credibly across disciplines. Second, the material achievement of **Alone in the World?** sets a standard for **theological anthropology** in dialogue with the sciences, reconfiguring the **imago Dei** around embodied relationality, symbolic capacity, and moral agency in evolutionary history. Third, the pedagogical achievement of cultivating **epistemic virtues** across the curriculum has shaped a generation of scholars in **theology-and-science**. The limits of his project remain important. Transversality depends on overlapping rationalities that may be thinner than doctrinal communities require, and the account of normativity can drift toward the procedural. Yet his work continues to prompt careful questions about how **doctrine**, **science**, and **hermeneutics** may coexist fruitfully under a shared commitment to truth.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation in principle
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS angle, van Huyssteen’s appeal to **general revelation**, **common grace**, and the two books of God is a salutary correction of insular fideism, and his **public theology** models charity without capitulation. Yet tensions appear at key points. His **postfoundationalist rationality** risks placing the norms of **Scripture as principium cognoscendi** under the adjudication of transversal standards that are not explicitly governed by **Sola Scriptura** and the **analogia fidei**. The noetic effects of **sin** are largely treated as epistemic humility rather than as covenantal antithesis, so the sharp Reformed insight into the suppression of truth is muted. His **imago Dei** as embodied relationality is a welcome corrective to disembodied accounts, yet it may displace the covenantal and Christological center where **imago** is renewed and known through union with **Christ** and the illumination of the **Spirit**. A Reformed alternative would receive van Huyssteen’s **epistemic virtues** as gifts of common grace while insisting that interdisciplinarity be normed explicitly by **Scripture’s** self-witness and the **covenantal** structure of knowledge, where the sciences are welcomed guests at a table set by the Lord of the covenant rather than co-legislators in a transversal court.
