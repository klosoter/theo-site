### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John Goldingay, born in 1942, emerged from the crucible of postwar British biblical theology, formed amid the ferment shaped by **Gerhard von Rad’s Heilsgeschichte**, **James Barr’s philological and semantic critiques**, **Brevard Childs’s canonical approach**, and **Walter Brueggemann’s rhetorical-theological imagination**. Ordained in the Church of England and seasoned by parish ministry as well as academic leadership in the United Kingdom before his 1997 appointment as the **David Allan Hubbard Professor of Old Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary**, he navigated the Anglican via media with a distinctive evangelical accent. That pastoral-academic matrix grounds his abiding thesis: the church must hear the **Old Testament as Scripture**, not as a prologue to be eclipsed by the **New Testament**, but as a divinely authorized voice that continues to instruct, reprove, and console the people of God.

Within this context Goldingay forged a method he often describes through the lens of **models** and **polyphony**. In **Models for Scripture** 1994 and earlier in **Approaches to Old Testament Interpretation** 1981 he counseled the church to resist single-reduction accounts of biblical authority. The Scriptures function as **authoritative canon**, as **witness to God’s acts**, as **narrative that shapes identity**, and as **instruction that forms practice**. This multi-model hermeneutic is a postcritical stance, neither rejecting **historical criticism** nor permitting it to colonize theological reading. It is a canonical realism: Scripture in its received **canon** addresses the church as divine address, yet always in the concreteness of **Israel’s story**, a story that speaks through diverse genres and tensions rather than through a harmonized system.

The Anglican texture of his work is equally clear. Liturgical habits, attention to **Torah, Prophets, and Writings**, and the pastoral burden of preaching inform his refusal to collapse the Old Testament into a set of proof texts. His posture differs from some modern dogmatic theologians in that he privileges what he calls **Israel’s gospel**, the news of God’s doings in creation, exodus, monarchy, exile, and return, over abstracted metaphysical proposals about **divine simplicity** or **immutability**. Yet he is not anti-doctrinal. Rather, his order of knowing is narrative to confession to ethics: **story** grounds **faith**, and **faith** frames **life**.

#### 2. The Old Testament Theology trilogy: Israel’s Gospel, Faith, and Life
Goldingay’s mature program crystallizes in the three volumes of **Old Testament Theology**. Volume 1, **Israel’s Gospel** 2003, retells Scripture’s plot from creation to postexilic hope as the good news of Yhwh’s identity revealed in acts and words. The conceptual decision to call this story a **gospel** signals that the Old Testament does not await legitimation from the New; it is already God’s saving proclamation. Creation and mandate, the election of Abraham, exodus and Sinai, land and kingship, exile and restoration, are rendered as a coherent narrative, yet without suppressing the countervoices of lament, crisis, and judgment that permeate the **Psalms** and the **Prophets**. Here Goldingay extends **von Rad’s Heilsgeschichte** while resisting the tendency to isolate a single salvific core, insisting instead on the breadth of divine action across worship, polity, and international relations.

Volume 2, **Israel’s Faith** 2006, pivots from narrative to confession. It arranges Old Testament witness topically, sketching a grammar of Israel’s speech about **God**, **humanity**, **covenant**, **Torah**, **land**, **monarchy**, **prophecy**, **wisdom**, and **worship**. The method exemplifies canonical synthesis balanced by philological care learned from **James Barr**. For instance, his discussion of **monotheism** spies a dynamic insistence that Yhwh alone is God, not as an abstract oneness but as the living Lord who hears, sees, remembers, and acts. Similarly, his account of **covenant** refuses to homogenize **Sinai**, **David**, and **new covenant** texts, letting each define its scope while exploring their interrelations as the canon places them side by side. The result is neither dogmatic systematics nor atomized exegesis, but a thick descriptive theology informed by the canon’s own emphases.

Volume 3, **Israel’s Life** 2009, extends the program into ethics. **Torah as instruction** becomes the central category for ordering topics such as **family**, **economics**, **justice**, **sexuality**, **war and peace**, and **Sabbath**. Goldingay places the casuistry of Exodus and Deuteronomy alongside the prophetic critique and the sapiential reflection of Proverbs and Job, arguing that Old Testament ethics are both **community-forming** and **mission-facing**. His approach resists both legalistic reduction and antinomian dismissal, articulating an ethic that envisions a concrete social shape for holiness. In this movement from story to confession to practice, the trilogy maps **Israel’s gospel**, **Israel’s faith**, and **Israel’s life** as an organic whole.

#### 3. Exegetical anchors: Daniel, Psalms, Isaiah, and translation
Before and alongside the trilogy, Goldingay built substantive exegetical foundations. His **Daniel** volume in the **Word Biblical Commentary** 1989 showcases his willingness to exploit **historical-critical** tools while retrieving the book’s theological thrust concerning **kingdom**, **empire**, and **faithful witness**. His three-volume **Psalms** commentary in the **Baker Commentary on the Old Testament Wisdom and Psalms** 2006–2008 is a monumental exercise in theological exegesis, mining the Psalter for a theology of **prayer**, **praise**, **lament**, and **royal hope** that informs his broader account of Israel’s worship. In **The Message of Isaiah 40–55** 2005 and **The Theology of the Book of Isaiah** 2014, he presses the logic of **Second Isaiah’s** proclamation of Yhwh’s reign, the **Servant’s** vocation, and the universal horizon of **salvation**. These exegetical projects model his conviction that theology must remain tethered to texts, discourses, and canonical shape.

His boldest linguistic contribution is **The First Testament: A New Translation** 2018, where he renders the Hebrew into contemporary English with an ear for **Hebrew idiom** and a preference for recovering terms like **Yhwh** in place of Lord. The translation aims less at liturgical familiarity than at defamiliarizing readers into hearing the Old Testament’s strangeness, a theological decision to let **Israel’s voice** ring without premature domestication. By foregrounding names, metaphors, and syntax that modern versions smooth out, he draws attention to the Old Testament’s particularity, sharpening the church’s perception of **revelation** carried in ordinary linguistic vessels.

#### 4. Scripture, authority, and hermeneutics
Goldingay’s proposals about Scripture’s authority are best read through **Models for Scripture** 1994, where he encourages a multi-angled confession rather than a single dogmatic formula. The Bible is **authoritative canon** that binds the church; it is **witness to God’s acts and words**; it is **story that forms identity**; it is **instruction that shapes practice**; it is **sacramental medium** through which God addresses the church. Such plurality is not relativism. It is his attempt to receive Scripture’s functions analogically rather than literally applying a single metaphor. He affirms divine **inspiration** as the Spirit’s work in and through human authors and communities, but he resists defining **inerrancy** in abstract terms, preferring to treat **truthfulness** as Scripture’s capacity to accomplish God’s communicative purposes across genres and contexts.

In relation to the canon, he stands near **Brevard Childs** in giving norming priority to the received form of **Torah, Prophets, and Writings** but differs in tone and emphasis. Childs often moves quickly to a canonical construal that subordinates historical questions; Goldingay keeps **historical criticism** close at hand as a set of tools for clarifying the voices that compose the canonical polyphony. Conversely, although he agrees with **Walter Brueggemann** that Israel’s testimony is multivocal and rhetorically potent, he is less suspicious of stability, allowing stable thematic through-lines like **covenant fidelity** and **Yhwh’s kingship** to structure the whole. The net result is a **postcritical canonical realism**: a stable canon, a real God who acts and speaks, historical humility, and a hermeneutic of trust under divine address.

#### 5. The doctrine of God: dynamic monotheism and divine pathos
The doctrine of God in Goldingay’s work is an Old Testament dogmatics in miniature. He speaks of **monotheism** not as a metaphysical thesis but as the confession that **Yhwh alone** creates, judges, and saves. Drawing on the prophets and **Psalms**, he emphasizes **divine pathos**, echoing **Abraham Joshua Heschel** in observing how God is moved by human suffering and sin. God’s **jealousy**, **mercy**, **longsuffering**, and **wrath** are not embarrassments to be theologically laundered but the terms by which Scripture narrates God’s steadfast love. He is cautious about importing classical categories such as **divine immutability** and **impassibility** without exegetical warrant, preferring to say that God is constant in purpose while responsive in relation. The guiding grammar is **narrative realism**: the God who swears oath to Abraham, who forgives at Sinai, and who disciplines in exile remains the same God who is faithful to Israel and Lord of the nations.

The Christological and pneumatological bearings of this Old Testament theism are made explicit in **Biblical Theology: The God of the Christian Scriptures** 2016. There he argues that the God confessed in the New Testament is the God of **Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob**, now known through **Jesus Messiah** and the **Holy Spirit**. The move is not a revision of divine identity but an eschatological deepening of **Israel’s confession**. This permits him to respect the Old Testament’s integrity while avoiding a two-God hermeneutic. Yet he persists in warning against dissolving Old Testament language into later dogmatic formulas, protecting **Israel’s voice** so that the church may be converted afresh by its testimony.

#### 6. Israel, church, and ethical continuity
A hallmark of Goldingay’s work is his rejection of **supersessionism**. In **Do We Need the New Testament?** 2015 he poses the question polemically to provoke the church to receive **Israel’s Scriptures** as sufficient to articulate the majority of Christian doctrine and ethics. His answer is that we do need the New Testament to know **Jesus** and to learn how to live as his body, but we must not treat the Old as replaced. The **church** is grafted into **Israel’s story**, and that grafting complicates how we reckon with **Torah**. On some matters he sees enduring instruction, for example the social vision of **Sabbath**, **jubilee economics**, and **justice for the vulnerable**. On other matters, such as **food laws** and **circumcision**, he follows the New Testament’s reconfiguration for a multiethnic body. He resists schemata that erase the Old Testament’s social concreteness in favor of purely inward moralism.

This hermeneutic extends to **land** and **peoplehood**. He argues that the **land promise** and the existence of a distinct **people Israel** remain part of God’s purposes, though he is cautious about aligning biblical promise with any single geopolitical program. The point is theological: the God of Scripture binds himself to **particulars**. That particularity trains the church to listen to other particularities in its own life, guarding against disembodied universality. Such commitments flow naturally from his readings of **Isaiah**, **Jeremiah**, and the **Psalms**, where salvation is always both cosmic and local, both universal in scope and tethered to concrete communities and practices.

#### 7. Pastoral voice, accessibility, and the moral imagination
Goldingay writes not only for guild peers but for pastors and lay readers. His multi-volume **Old Testament for Everyone** series and countless sermons and essays translate his **Old Testament theology** into the cadences of preaching, prayer, and discipleship. The commentary on the **Psalms** shaped a generation of pastors to pray Israel’s prayers without embarrassment, reclaiming **lament** as a norm of faithful piety. In treatments of **violence**, **sexuality**, and **economic life**, he models a way of letting Old Testament texts confront and reform the modern church’s moral imagination. This pastoral-public voice is not an application appended at the end of exegesis. It is the fruit of his conviction that **Torah as instruction** intends to form a people who embody the **holy love** of the God of Israel.

His translation work in **The First Testament** belongs to this pastoral strategy. By sounding Old Testament speech afresh he hopes to dislodge comfortable mishearings and to re-situate readers within **Israel’s world**. For him the shock of strangeness is not alienation but invitation. It recalls the church to **revelation’s** otherness, to sanctified patience with texts that do not instantly flatter modern assumptions. The result has been a widening of the church’s repertoire, particularly in communities shaped by evangelical piety that had been tempted to live largely in the **New Testament** and the **Psalms** while ignoring **Law** and **Prophets**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: between Brueggemann and Childs, before Barr
Goldingay’s middle position between **Brueggemann** and **Childs** is deliberate. With **Brueggemann** he emphasizes **polyphony**, rhetorical power, and the destabilizing edges of prophetic speech. With **Childs** he grants the **canon** a norming, ecclesial role in theological reading. Against the extremes of either, he worries that unbounded pluralism loses the church in flux, while overly strong canonical harmonization muffles the **minor keys** of the text. **James Barr** remains a continual sparring partner whose analytic discipline and suspicion of theological eisegesis Goldingay honors by meticulous attention to lexical and contextual detail. Yet unlike Barr, he is resolved that the Old Testament is **Scripture**, not merely religious literature, and thus properly the material of **theology**. In these triangulations his Anglican identity is again visible: a both-and posture that prefers patient integration over polemical exclusion.

His approach also interacts with broader debates about **biblical theology** and **systematic theology**. Goldingay treats the Old Testament’s conceptuality as sufficient to articulate robust claims about **God**, **humanity**, and **salvation**, yet he remains wary of forcing those claims into later **dogmatic** idioms without remainder. He advocates a diachronic reading that honors **canonical shape** and **historical development**. The goal is not to refuse **systematics**, but to allow systematic construction to be disciplined by the grain of the **Old Testament**. In that sense, his work participates in a wider renewal of **theological interpretation of Scripture**, but on profoundly exegetical terms.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation: appreciations and cautions
From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Goldingay is a formidable ally against **Marcionism**, a careful advocate of **canonical primacy**, and a wise teacher of **Torah as instruction** for the church’s sanctification. His narrative-first account of **Israel’s gospel** resonates with **Vosian biblical theology** in its redemptive-historical instincts, and his exegetical labor in **Psalms**, **Isaiah**, and **Daniel** furnishes resources for preaching the whole counsel of God. Yet several tensions invite Reformed critique. First, his **models for Scripture** approach, while pastorally judicious, can underarticulate a thick doctrine of **inspiration** and the **inerrancy** of Scripture as affirmed in classic Reformed confessions. The Westminster standards would press beyond functional truthfulness to affirm Scripture’s full **veracity** in all it asserts, guarding confidence in **special revelation** amid critical debate. Second, his articulation of **divine pathos** and reserve toward **divine immutability** and **impassibility** risks recasting God’s covenantal responsiveness as ontological mutability. Classical Reformed theology, drawing on **divine simplicity**, distinguishes God’s unchanging being *ad intra* from his real relations *ad extra*, preserving the biblical witness to God’s constancy while explaining anthropomorphic idiom. Third, his reluctance to drive **Christological typology** may underplay the canonical claim that Christ is the **substance** of the promises and the **telos** of **Torah**, whereas Reformed hermeneutics, without erasing **Israel’s voice**, would strengthen **sensus plenior** under canonical control. Finally, his emphasis on the ongoing distinctness of **Israel** can inadvertently loosen the Reformed doctrine of the **covenant of grace** and the unity of the **people of God** in Christ; covenant theology offers a robust alternative framing in which ecclesial grafting does not entail parallel economies of salvation. The most fruitful Reformed appropriation of Goldingay will therefore receive his exegetical and canonical gains while reasserting a confessional doctrine of **Scripture**, a classical doctrine of **God**, a Christ-centered **typology**, and a covenantal account of **continuity and discontinuity**.
