### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
John F. Kilner emerges within a **contemporary Evangelical** consolidation of theological ethics in the late twentieth century, as medicine’s technological capacities outran inherited moral scripts and the field of **bioethics** crystallized in the academy and clinic. As founding director of the **Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity** in 1994 at Trinity International University and longtime professor at **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School**, he helped constitute a distinctly **Evangelical bioethical discourse** that was both confessionally rooted and publicly conversant. Trained in **theological ethics** and shaped by hospital engagement and policy forums, Kilner was influenced by **Paul Ramsey’s covenantal fidelity and patient-centered norms**, **Edmund D. Pellegrino’s medicine-as-moral-enterprise**, and **Gilbert Meilaender’s Augustinian reserve**, while also absorbing the expository orientation of Evangelical **biblical theology**. This mixture formed a method that prioritizes **Scripture’s canonical pattern** and christological focus for anthropology, while drawing on the tools of **principlism** and casuistry where they can be theologically chastened. The hallmark of Kilner’s method is the tethering of **moral discernment** to a robust account of the **imago Dei**, argued through close readings of **Genesis 1:26-28**, the LXX’s **eikon** language, and New Testament texts like **Colossians 1:15** and **Romans 8:29**.

Kilner self-consciously positions himself at the crossroad of **exegesis**, **dogmatics**, and **public engagement**, insisting that a credible Christian witness in the clinic requires both **theological clarity** and **interdisciplinary prudence**. He resists reductionist accounts of human worth grounded in **functional capacities**, contesting both secular **utilitarianism** and religiously motivated **perfectionisms**. Theologically, he retrieves **Irenaeus’s** and patristic themes that tie human fulfillment to **Christ the Image**, while carefully reframing **Aquinas’s structuralist habits** and **Karl Barth’s relationalism**. His **hermeneutic** is canonical, reading the **Hebrew tselem and demut** of Genesis within the **Christological telos** of Scripture, thereby steering evangelical ethics toward a **christocentric anthropology** that can underwrite stable **human dignity** in plural contexts.

#### 2. Early bioethics: allocation, sanctity, and public reason
Kilner’s early work, typified by **Who Lives? Who Dies? Ethical Criteria in Patient Selection** in 1990, addressed the fraught question of **scarce-resource allocation** in the wake of dialysis committees and ICU triage. He rejected both **pure utilitarian calculus** and unbounded autonomy, arguing for **justice** that prioritizes need, likelihood of benefit without degrading the vulnerable, and transparent criteria shaped by **human worth** grounded in the **imago Dei**. The practical implication was to expose the covert moral premises in institutional policies and to commend **equitable triage** that honors the sanctity of life while acknowledging stewardship limits. Here Kilner already displayed his signature blend of **moral analysis** and **theological anthropology**, maintaining that the normative constants are **love of neighbor**, **nonmaleficence**, and **justice**, interpreted through **creation-fall-redemption** rather than through a thin secular **principlism**.

In the clinic, questions of **end-of-life decisions** pressed the same logic. Kilner distinguished **killing** from **allowing to die**, endorsed careful **proportionate treatment** standards, and critiqued **euthanasia** and **physician-assisted suicide** as violations of **God’s sovereignty** over life and of the neighbor’s inherent **dignity**. He appropriated the **sanctity-of-life** tradition while resisting its caricature as therapeutic absolutism. In setting limits, he leveraged the **stewardship** motif, the moral insight that medicine is a finite vocation within **creational bounds**, and thus clinicians may forgo disproportionate means without denying **imago Dei** respect. These early positions would become building blocks for later engagements with **CRISPR**, **stem-cell research**, and **enhancement**, where the temptation to instrumentalize human life escalates.

#### 3. Biotechnology and the shape of the human good
With colleagues in **Biotechnology and the Human Good** in 2007, Kilner turned to the accelerating frontier of **enhancement** and **biotech**, setting Christians to discern between **therapy** that repairs creational damage and **enhancement** that projects contested visions of human excellence. The book advances a **teleological account of the human good** grounded in **creation, fall, and redemption**, resisting both **technological utopianism** and reactionary technophobia. The normative center is the **imago Dei**: because human beings are oriented to reflect **Christ the Image**, technologies must be evaluated by how they serve or frustrate that **destiny**. He argued for **moral limits** on germline interventions, rejected embryo-destructive **research**, and warned against market logics that commodify bodies and identities. Yet he welcomed therapies that genuinely **heal**, restore agency, or alleviate suffering, so long as they respect **justice** and the vulnerable.

Kilner’s public posture is intentionally dialogical. He engages **Peter Singer’s utilitarian personhood**, **Nick Bostrom’s transhumanism**, and secular bioethics’ **autonomy maximalism** by offering **thick accounts** of the human good legible in public reason but anchored in **revelation**. He appropriates insights from **Edmund Pellegrino** on medicine’s internal morality and **Gilbert Meilaender** on humility in the face of finitude, while refracting these through the **biblical doctrine of creation**. The resulting ethic critiques technocratic narratives not merely for pragmatic hazards but for their **anthropological failures**, namely the erasure of **giftedness**, **dependence**, and **creaturely limits** that are constitutive of life ordered to **God**.

#### 4. Dignity and Destiny: a christocentric imago Dei
Kilner’s mature synthesis appears in **Dignity and Destiny: Humanity in the Image of God** in 2015, a major statement on the **imago Dei** that integrates exegesis, historical theology, and ethics. He contends that Scripture consistently identifies **Christ** as the **Image of God** in whom and toward whom humanity is created, citing **Colossians 1:15**, **2 Corinthians 4:4**, and **Romans 8:29**. Genesis 1:26-27, with its **tselem** and **demut**, he argues, should be read as humanity created **according to** the Image, an orientation or **destiny** to reflect **God’s moral character** through **Christ**. This allows him to distinguish between **status** and **reflection**: all humans possess full **dignity** by virtue of being made in relation to the Image, yet humans fail to reflect that Image morally because of the **fall**. The fall diminishes **likeness** but not **status**, preserving grounds for equal worth and rights while explaining human depravity.

This conceptual clarification directly supports bioethical judgments. Because dignity inheres in **status** rather than present **capacities**, embryos, the severely disabled, and the elderly retain full moral worth. Because **reflection** is damaged, there is no warrant to grade persons by intelligence, autonomy, or social contribution. Kilner critiques **structural** accounts that locate the image in capacities like reason, **functional** accounts that ground it in dominion or cultural labor alone, and **relational** accounts that tether it primarily to interhuman relations. He retrieves instead a **christological and eschatological account** in which **sanctification** conforms people to Christ, the **Image**, and **glorification** consummates that destiny. Ethics is thus not merely inferential from **ontology** but teleological toward **conformity to Christ**, providing a coherent bridge between anthropology and discipleship.

#### 5. Exegetical and historical interlocutors
Exegetically, Kilner’s argument leans on the LXX’s **eikon** and on the New Testament’s use of **eikon language** to identify **Jesus** as the definitive **Image**. He notes that the preposition behind created-in-language in **Genesis 1** can bear the force of created **according to** the Image, which he correlates with **Romans 8:29’s** predestination to be **conformed to the Image** of the Son. Historically, he resonates with **Irenaeus’s** distinction between **image** and **likeness**, while resisting any reading that ontologizes the loss of the image in a way that would permit the exclusion of sinners from **moral consideration**. He appreciates **Aquinas’s** careful gradations of image concerning memory, intellect, and will, but judges them vulnerable to capacity-based stratification. He engages **Karl Barth’s relationalism**, valuing its trinitarian impulse, yet insists that the **economic Christology** of the New Testament puts **Christ the Image** at the center rather than the human male-female relation.

Among contemporary exegetes and theologians, Kilner disputes **J. Richard Middleton’s** royal-functional emphasis when it becomes dominant, and he reframes **Stanley Grenz’s** communitarian account by specifying that human community is not the image itself but a sphere for its **reflection**. He maintains that dominion, community, and rationality are important **implications** of the imago Dei but not its seat. This de-centering of capacities in favor of **Christological orientation** is the doctrinal keystone that stabilizes human worth through every stage of life and in every condition. The anchor is **dignity and destiny**: dignity names the inalienable worth of persons because of their **God-related status**, destiny names their eschatological calling to **reflect Christ** in holiness and love.

#### 6. Ethical applications: embryos, dying, and enhancement
Applying this anthropology, Kilner argues that **embryonic human beings** are neighbors endowed with **imago Dei status**, thus research that necessitates embryo destruction is morally impermissible. He presses researchers and policymakers to pursue **adult stem cells**, **induced pluripotent stem cells**, and non-destructive avenues that honor both **scientific excellence** and **human dignity**. On **end-of-life**, Kilner defends **palliative care**, refuses both **lethal dosing** and **abandonment**, and clarifies the legitimacy of withdrawing disproportionately burdensome treatment. His ethic of **truth-telling**, **consent**, and **nonmaleficence** is not borrowed from secular **principlism** but grounded in **love**, **justice**, and **stewardship** articulated through creation’s moral order.

With **enhancement**, Kilner’s therapy-enhancement distinction functions as a prudential starting point, not an absolute line. He cautions against enhancements that encode **ableism**, intensify **inequity**, or project a **Promethean anthropology** that refuses creaturely limits. Against **transhumanism** as popularized by **Nick Bostrom**, he contends that the promise of self-authored transcendence rivals the **gospel’s** account of transformation and thereby distorts the **human telos**. Technologies are judged by their conformity to **God’s purposes** for human flourishing, which are narratively specified by **creation** and **Christ’s likeness**, not by market demand or consumer preference.

#### 7. The church in public: catechesis and institutional imagination
Kilner advances a resolutely ecclesial vision in **Why the Church Needs Bioethics** in 2011 and in edited projects like **Why People Matter** in 2017, equipping congregations for **catechesis** in life-and-death decisions. He shows how **pastoral care**, **hospital chaplaincy**, and **Christian education** must be retooled to address **advance directives**, **fertility treatments**, and **genetic screening**. The church’s task is to cultivate **practical wisdom** that is neither legalistic nor permissive, grounded instead in **virtue**, **prayer**, and **communal discernment**. Kilner also fosters institutional imagination, urging Christian colleges, seminaries, and health systems to adopt **policies** and **codes** that concretize **imago Dei commitments** and safeguard the vulnerable in hiring, clinical protocols, and community outreach.

Publicly, he models **convicted civility**. Kilner can argue in **natural-law-friendly** registers about human goods without surrendering **Scripture’s normativity**. He collaborates across traditions, learning from **Catholic moral theology** while holding fast to Evangelical emphases on **biblical authority** and **personal conversion**. The goal is a witness that is both **publicly intelligible** and theologically thick, so that the church’s no to **dehumanizing practices** is matched by a robust yes to **care**, **community**, and **healing**.

#### 8. Coherence, critique, and constructive reach
The conceptual heart of Kilner’s corpus is the pairing **dignity and destiny**, which resolves tensions in imago Dei discourse and translates into stable bioethical guidance. By distinguishing **status** from **reflection**, he avoids both the **capacity trap** of functionalism and the **static ontologism** that cannot account for sin and sanctification. His **christocentric anthropology** grounds human rights, solidarity with the disabled, and resistance to technocratic domination. It coheres with a redemptive-historical vision where **eschatology** shapes ethics without erasing the givenness of **creation**. A measured **teleology** governs evaluation of technologies, while a modest **casuistry** renders judgments case by case under principled guidance.

There are tensions to note. Some readers worry that describing the image as primarily **orientation to Christ** risks underplaying the **protological gifts** of created righteousness and human faculties emphasized in classic **Reformed** accounts. Others probe whether the therapy-enhancement distinction can bear the normative load in edge cases such as **cognitive enhancement** for the disabled, where therapy and enhancement interpenetrate. Kilner addresses these by reasserting the central criterion of **faithful reflection** of God’s character: what restores, protects, and orders life toward **holiness** and **love** is morally praiseworthy, while what commodifies, coerces, or inflates pride is not. His synthesis remains among the most pastorally serviceable and academically credible Evangelical accounts of the **imago Dei** and its bioethical entailments.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation. Kilner’s **christological imago Dei** aligns with **Calvin’s** insistence that in Christ we see true humanity and with **Bavinck’s** teleological anthropology; his **status versus reflection** distinction guards the **universal dignity** that grounds sanctity-of-life ethics. Yet classic Reformed orthodoxy accents **covenantal protology** under a **covenant of works**, **original righteousness**, and **federal headship** in Adam, such that the image includes moral-righteousness that was truly possessed and then marred. Kilner’s emphasis on orientation and destiny could be strengthened by clearer incorporation of **covenant categories**, clarifying how **law** and **natural law** function as creational norms perceived through **common grace** without supplanting **special revelation**. On public bioethics, his use of **natural-law-friendly** argument can be welcomed as wise prudence, provided it is explicitly subordinated to **Scripture’s sufficiency** and the **redemptive-historical** frame that orders creation and culture under **covenant lordship**. Within those clarifications, Reformed theology can adopt Kilner’s **imago Dei** as a powerful resource for resisting **utilitarianism**, dignifying the least, and discerning **technology** in covenantal obedience.
