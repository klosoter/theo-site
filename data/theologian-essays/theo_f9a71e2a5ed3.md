### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Born in 1938 and teaching for decades at the University of Texas at Austin, **Robert Kane** rose to prominence as a leading defender of **libertarian free will** in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. His work matured in a period marked by **Frankfurt-style counterexamples** to alternative possibilities after 1969, by the resurgence of **incompatibilism** with **Peter van Inwagen’s Consequence Argument** in 1983, and by the cultural authority of **neuroscience** pressing claims about the causal closure of the physical. The tableau required a libertarianism that could engage precise analytic objections while avoiding precritical metaphysics. Kane’s style is classic **analytic philosophy of action** fit for a post-positivist era, with attention to modal clarity, thought experiments, and the rational phenomenology of choice under conflict, all within a chastened naturalism that does not deny **indeterminism** within physics.

Kane’s method couples conceptual analysis with a descriptive account of inner struggle, what he calls the experience of effortful willing when one is torn between competing values. He insists that the felt tension of deliberation is not epiphenomenal and that it can be modeled in terms of **indeterministic processes** within the brain that are harnessed by the agent’s effort. The stance is neither dualist nor reductionist. It is a **moderate event-causal libertarianism** that invokes no sui generis agent-causal substance while still rejecting **compatibilism**. Kane’s approach thereby stakes a path between **Roderick Chisholm’s agent causation** and **Daniel Dennett’s compatibilist model**, yielding a measurable and testable account of control he calls **plural voluntary control**.

#### 2. Works and developmental arc
Kane’s first book, **Free Will and Values** published in 1985, set the moral stakes by defending the connection between freedom and the meaningfulness of life-projects. He expanded and deepened the argument in **The Significance of Free Will** published in 1996, a landmark statement that carefully articulates **ultimate responsibility**, the notion that responsibility requires being the ultimate source of actions and character. As editor of **The Oxford Handbook of Free Will** in 2002 with a revised edition in 2011, Kane curated the field’s leading arguments on **compatibilism**, **skepticism**, and **libertarianism**, thereby institutionalizing a taxonomy of positions that he sharpened in **A Contemporary Introduction to Free Will** published in 2005. In **Four Views on Free Will** from 2007 he presents his case against **John Martin Fischer’s semicompatibilism**, **Derk Pereboom’s hard incompatibilism**, and **Manuel Vargas’s revisionism**, while **Ethics and the Quest for Wisdom** published in 2010 recasts his agency theory within a vision of practical wisdom akin to **Aristotle’s phronesis** and **Kant’s autonomy**, foregrounding the normative centrality of **self-forming actions** for moral growth.

Across these works Kane’s developmental arc shows a steady refinement. Early emphases on the worth of freedom are systematized in 1996 into a precise architecture of **self-forming actions** that anchor **ultimate responsibility**. The later volumes clarify his **indeterministic event-causal** commitment, distance him from robust **agent-causal** metaphysics, and answer mounting worries about **luck**, **neuroscience**, and **Frankfurt cases**. The editorial breadth of the Oxford Handbooks places his constructive thesis within a comprehensive mapping of interlocutors, ensuring that **libertarianism** re-entered mainstream analytic discussion with rigor and fair-minded engagement.

#### 3. Ultimate responsibility and self-forming actions
The core of Kane’s theory is **ultimate responsibility** often abbreviated as UR in the literature. UR states that a person is morally responsible for an action only if the action’s causal history traces to past voluntary actions that were themselves under the agent’s control in a way not wholly determined by prior events and laws. To make this concrete, Kane introduces **self-forming actions**, decisive choices that shape one’s future character. These occur in **torn decisions** where the agent faces conflicting but reasonable motivations and must make an effort of will to resolve the conflict. Kane argues that in such moments there is **indeterminism** in the neural processes associated with the effort, yet the indeterminism does not render the outcome random because the agent’s endeavor sustains competing motivational pathways long enough to bias the result through **effort-sensitive amplification**.

A crucial distinction in Kane’s account is between actions that express settled character and **self-forming actions** that create or revise character. While many everyday actions may be causally determined by one’s character and circumstances, **ultimate responsibility** requires that the settled character itself be traceable to prior self-forming moments that were not determined. In this way, later responsible action can be compatible with determination so long as there exists an earlier indeterministic kernel that grounded the agent as the ultimate source. Kane thus honors key intuitions of **compatibilism** about stability and guidance over time while preserving the **incompatibilist** thesis that responsibility cannot arise ex nihilo from a determined past.

#### 4. Plural voluntary control and alternative possibilities
Kane advances **plural voluntary control**, the idea that an agent exercises control when it is true that she could have done otherwise under exactly the same past and laws and that the plurality of possibilities is anchored in her present effort of will. This supports a qualified defense of the **principle of alternative possibilities**. Kane concedes that responsibility can sometimes persist without alternatives when it is appropriately traced to earlier **self-forming actions**, but he insists that genuine liberty at some point in a life requires actual **alternative possibilities**, not merely counterfactual elucidations of guidance control. The phenomenology of struggle is crucial here. The effort to sustain reasons on both sides reflects the agent’s aim to keep options live. The live options, in turn, are not the passive deliverance of chance but the active work of agency under **indeterminism**, whereby the agent increases the probability of either path by working to appreciate its reasons.

The technical upshot is an **event-causal libertarianism** that avoids an extra layer of **agent causation** and yet resists the **luck objection**. Kane argues that critics conflate indeterminacy with sheer randomness, whereas probabilistic causation conditioned by effort allows for rational explanation of why the outcome counts as the agent’s deed. The choice that resolves the torn decision is not uncaused, nor is it externally caused in a way that bypasses the agent’s control. It is caused by a structured set of reasons and efforts within the agent in which **indeterminism** functions as enabling openness rather than as an alien force.

#### 5. Replies to the luck problem and the neuroscience challenge
The **luck problem** objects that if choices are undetermined at the moment of decision, the upshot is a matter of luck, not control. Kane’s reply has two components. First, he distinguishes **constitutive luck** about who one is at earlier times from **present performance luck** in the torn decision. He grants that indeterminism introduces elementally small luck at the micro level but contends that the agent’s sustained effort over time can harness indeterminacy to realize reasons-responsive action. Second, he offers a model of **probabilistic causation** in which effort changes the probabilities so that whichever way the agent goes, the outcome is attributable to her. The agent bears **ultimate responsibility** because she was the one who made it the case that either of the reasonable alternatives would occur through her exertion of will.

Neuroscientific challenges leverage studies like readiness potential findings to argue that **conscious will** is a mere afterglow of deterministic brain processes. Kane’s strategy is to reinterpret the data through the lens of complex systems and **noise-sensitive dynamics**, conceding that preconscious processes prepare action while insisting that conscious effort can still play a modulating role. He appeals to plausible **micro-indeterminism** at neural junctions and to the capacity of top-down attention to amplify or dampen pathways, so that **self-forming actions** become the emergent products of a hierarchical agent rather than the mere outcomes of subpersonal machinery. The view allows for continuity with **physics** while resisting hard determinism or eliminative accounts of reasons.

#### 6. Interlocutors and critical engagements
Kane’s debate with **John Martin Fischer and Mark Ravizza** addresses the notion of **guidance control** and **reasons-responsiveness** under compatibilism. He agrees that guidance matters but argues that guidance without **alternative possibilities** cannot yield **ultimate responsibility**. In response to **Frankfurt cases**, which aim to show that responsibility does not require the ability to do otherwise, Kane deploys **tracing** to earlier **self-forming actions** and further argues that in many real-world cases the intervener undermines the very kind of effort-sensitive openness that grounds responsible control. Against **Derk Pereboom’s hard incompatibilism**, which denies responsibility whether or not determinism is true, Kane maintains that his **indeterministic event-causal** model can sustain desert by connecting reasons, effort, and outcome without invoking mysterious agent-substance causation.

With **Peter van Inwagen**, Kane shares **incompatibilism** and appreciates the force of the **Consequence Argument**, yet he diverges by trying to render indeterminism action-guiding rather than epiphenomenal. He critiques **Daniel Dennett’s compatibilism** for diluting the platitude that freedom is worth wanting, arguing in line with his 1996 title that certain human goods depend on genuine openness. He also nuances distance from **Roderick Chisholm** by avoiding robust metaphysical **agent causation**, while showing sympathy with **Timothy O’Connor** and **Randolph Clarke** on the need for nonreductive agency. In reply to **Galen Strawson’s Basic Argument**, which claims that one cannot be ultimately responsible for character because that would require being causa sui, Kane accepts the depth of the regress but introduces **self-forming actions** as partial character-creative episodes that terminate the regress at points where agents make themselves incrementally without presupposing earlier self-creation.

#### 7. Normative vision and the meaning of free will
Beyond metaphysics, Kane advances a normative vision in which **freedom and value** are intertwined. In **Ethics and the Quest for Wisdom** he argues that persons seek practical wisdom through life-defining decisions that sculpt their moral identity. The good of self-formation requires **plural voluntary control** because human dignity is tied to being the author of a story that could have gone another way. Even when character becomes settled, the presence of earlier **self-forming actions** invests later determined actions with meaning and responsibility. Human life then becomes a drama of integrity amid conflict rather than a closed sequence of necessitated episodes. The key good is personal authorship under **ultimate responsibility**, a good that grounds desert, praise, blame, and the hope of moral growth.

Kane’s outlook resonates with **Aristotelian virtue theory** because of its emphasis on habituation and the momentousness of choices that fix character, and with **Kantian autonomy** because of its emphasis on self-legislation under rational reasons. Yet it remains distinctively **libertarian** in its insistence that some decisive moments must remain open in more than an evaluative sense. The unity of value and freedom in Kane’s project thus gives it traction beyond technical debates, pressing wider questions about justice, repentance, and the possibility of moral transformation.

#### 8. Theological intersections: sin, providence, and grace
While not a theologian by vocation, **Robert Kane** has become a touchstone for theological debates about **moral responsibility**, **providence**, and **theodicy**. His **ultimate responsibility** is often invoked by **Arminian** and **open theist** writers who seek to protect divine goodness from complicity in evil by positing **libertarian freedom** at the creaturely level. The structure of **self-forming actions** provides a secular grammar for concepts akin to conversion, repentance, and sanctification. In Kane’s terms, a person can be rescued from an inherited character by torn decisions in which grace, construed broadly as new reasons, is taken up through effort that is not predetermined. The ability to do otherwise in at least some life-defining episodes underwrites the intelligibility of guilt and penitence.

The challenges for theology are equally clear. Strong doctrines of **divine foreknowledge** and **meticulous providence** appear in tension with the **indeterministic event-causal** account. Kane himself does not enter the metaphysical terrain of **middle knowledge** or **divine timelessness**, but theologians extrapolating from him often favor open futurity models that interpret divine knowledge as comprehensive of possibilities rather than fixed future facts. Kane’s refusal of **agent-causal substances** also interacts with accounts of the soul and **imago Dei**. His model renders human agency robust while remaining naturalistic enough to engage **neuroscience**, offering theologians a path to affirm libertarian dignity without a heavy dualism.

#### 9. Limits, revisions, and legacy
Critics maintain that Kane’s answer to the **luck problem** either covertly reintroduces determination or leaves responsibility hostage to chance. Others worry that his appeal to **neural indeterminism** is speculative or that it presupposes a controversial reading of the brain’s noise as opportunity rather than obstacle. Kane responds by insisting that control is a functional-rational property, not a metaphysical saturation of causality, and that small-scale indeterminacy combined with agential effort suffices for authorship. He also notes that his theory allows for moral education and stable character, reducing worries that libertarianism entails capriciousness. Whether these replies satisfy depends on deeper intuitions about sourcehood versus guidance, a fault line sharpened by his engagements with **Fischer**, **Pereboom**, and **Dennett**.

As a field shaper, **Robert Kane** has few peers. By editing **The Oxford Handbook of Free Will** and authoring **The Significance of Free Will**, he set the research agenda for decades. The very quadrilateral he helped canonize in **Four Views on Free Will** has become the standard map in classrooms and seminars: **classical compatibilism**, **libertarianism**, **hard incompatibilism**, and **revisionism**. His distinctive contributions of **ultimate responsibility**, **self-forming actions**, and **plural voluntary control** continue to structure debates in philosophy, legal theory, and theology. Even those who remain **compatibilists** often appropriate his emphasis on character formation and the narrative shape of agency, thereby acknowledging the intuition that freedom is not only about options but about ownership.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, **Robert Kane’s libertarianism** stands in principled tension with **meticulous providence** and **unconditional election** as confessed in the Westminster standards. The Reformed doctrine of **moral inability** under **original sin** maintains that the sinner lacks the **alternative possibilities** required by Kane’s **plural voluntary control** until renewed by **effectual calling**, whereas responsibility is grounded in **freedom of inclination** rather than **libertarian openness**. On a **compatibilist** reading shaped by **Augustine** and **Jonathan Edwards**, the will is free when one acts according to one’s strongest motives without external constraint, and **ultimate responsibility** is relocated from indeterministic self-formation to the order of **divine decree** and **secondary causation** where God’s **concurrence** upholds creaturely agency without competitive rivalry. Kane’s insistence that desert requires **self-forming actions** appears to the Reformed eye to undervalue federal and covenantal structures by which guilt, grace, and sanctification are historically mediated. Yet his moral phenomenology of torn decisions and his emphasis on character-decisive moments can be fruitfully received within Reformed sanctification, where Spirit-wrought renewal grants new dispositions and the believer’s efforts are real, meaningful, and grace-enabled. A Reformed alternative would affirm robust responsibility under **providence** and **concursus**, deny that **libertarian freedom** is necessary for praise and blame, and preserve divine sovereignty in redemption and reprobation, while appropriating Kane’s insight that the drama of obedience unfolds through concrete choices that form habits of holiness in the history of the covenant people.
