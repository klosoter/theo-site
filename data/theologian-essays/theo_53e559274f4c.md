### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and Context: An Evangelical Mind in an Analytic Moment
John D. Laing belongs to the generation for whom **evangelical theology** was reanimated by the late twentieth century renaissance in **analytic philosophy of religion**. His formation occurs in a context shaped by the **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy**, the methodological challenge of **postmodern hermeneutics**, and the constructive possibilities opened by **Plantinga’s reformed epistemology**. He reads **Augustine** and **Aquinas** for architecture, **Calvin** for a Scripture-saturated habitus, and **Henry** for an evangelical doctrine of **revelation** that secures cognitive access to divine truth. Yet it is the methodological rigor of **Swinburne** and **Craig**, with their clarity about probability, explanation, and **cumulative-case apologetics**, that provides Laing’s proximate toolkit. His era is one of disciplinary cross-traffic: **systematic theology** and **philosophy of religion** meet under the canopy of **classical theism** and are asked to serve the practical ends of **apologetics** and **catechesis**. Against the backdrop of **postliberal narrativism** and **radical hermeneutics**, he positions himself as a chastened realist commending a theology that is both academically exacting and ecclesially useful.

In this intellectual climate Laing’s method is best described as **analytic-evangelical**. He is committed to **sola Scriptura** understood not as naked biblicism but as a canonical rule that governs theological reasoning by authorizing and delimiting doctrinal claims. With **Plantinga**, he contends for the rationality of **properly basic belief** in God while also insisting that the church should pursue **publicly accessible reasons**, defeater-defeaters, and a modest **natural theology**. With **Henry**, he affirms the propositional content of **revelation**, and with **Vanhoozer**, he appreciates the role of **theodramatic interpretation**, speech-act theory, and canonical discourse in illuminating **Scripture’s communicative action**. The result is a style of theologizing that refuses the antithesis between **faith seeking understanding** and **faith giving reasons**, presenting theology as both contemplative wisdom and rationally defensible knowledge.

#### 2. Scripture and Truth: Inerrancy, Hermeneutics, and Postmodernity
A constant in Laing’s work is a multi-angled defense of **biblical inerrancy** and the cognitivity of **doctrinal truth**. In essays gathered across 2005 to 2022 and focused in his 2018 volume on **Scripture, Truth, and Postmodernity**, he diagnoses the epistemic shifts that embolden hermeneutical suspicion. He engages **Derrida** and **Fish** as representative of the hermeneutics of undecidability and reader-response, arguing that these models undercut the church’s capacity to hear **Scripture** as God’s communicative act. In conversation with **Vanhoozer** and **Thiselton**, he defends a canonical-linguistic account of textual meaning that sustains authorial intent and recognizes the church’s interpretive tradition as a fallible but vital resource. The doctrine of **inerrancy** for Laing is nested within **divine accommodation** and **inspiration** by the **Spirit**, avoiding brittle harmonization and insisting on genre sensitivity, while refusing the slide from phenomenological description to **error**. He presses a distinction between **defeasible interpretations** and the indefectibility of the canonical discourse, thus maintaining both epistemic humility and doctrinal confidence.

At the level of theological epistemology, Laing draws on **reformed epistemology** and externalist accounts of warrant to argue that the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti** confers proper basicality on the gospel. Yet, anticipating defeaters within late-modern culture, he supplements this with **cumulative-case apologetics** that mobilizes arguments from **cosmology**, **design**, **moral realism**, and **resurrection**. The strategy is Augustinian in spirit and analytic in execution: **faith** is rationally responsible when it possesses defeater-defeaters in the presence of putative defeaters. Here Laing engages **Swinburne** on Bayesian confirmation and **Craig** on the historical case for **Easter**, offering an integrated account in which **Scripture** remains materially normative while **public arguments** play a ministerial role.

#### 3. Doctrine of God and Providence: Classical Theism with a Molinist Edge
On the doctrine of God Laing defends **classical theism**: **aseity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and a carefully retrieved **divine simplicity**. Against critics influenced by **process** or **open theism**, he argues that biblical exegesis of divine pathos must be read analogically and that the *via media* between impassibility and passibility lies in affirming **impassible love** alongside the **incarnation** as the locus of redemptive suffering. He follows **Aquinas** and **Bavinck** in articulating the **ad intra** and **ad extra** distinction, and insists that divine **aseity** protects **grace** as truly gratuitous. This classical frame, however, is paired with a constructive account of **providence** in which he defends a **Molinist** construal of **middle knowledge**. In his 2016 **Providence and Prayer: Middle Knowledge and Petitionary Practice**, Laing contends that **scientia media** provides a fertile ground for understanding how God sovereignly orders history while leaving intact **libertarian creaturely freedom** that secures robust moral responsibility.

Laing’s Molinism is pastoral as well as philosophical. He argues that **petitionary prayer** is instrumentally significant because God has eternally known what free creatures would do in any counterfactual circumstance and has decreed a world in which prayers are among the means to ordained ends. Interacting with **Flint**, **Craig**, and critics from **Thomist** and **Reformed** camps, he grants the mystery of counterfactual truthmakers while arguing that the payoff for **providence**, **missions**, and **assurance** commends the model. Against **open theism**, Molinism preserves **omniscience** and biblical prophecy; against hard **determinism**, it avoids reducing agency to mere compatibilist spontaneity. Laing does not dismiss compatibilist models, but he judges that the **biblical phenomenology of choice** and the apologetic need to address the **problem of evil** are better served by a middle-knowledge account of divine governance.

#### 4. Christ, Atonement, and Salvation: Evangelical Dogmatics in Analytic Key
Laing’s soteriology is classically evangelical, anchored in **penal substitution** at the cross and justified by a **multi-theory atonement model**. He argues that **Christus Victor**, **moral influence**, and **ransom** motifs contribute to the atonement’s plenitude, but that the grammar of **substitution** and **satisfaction** is dogmatically central because it alone explicates how **guilt** is removed and **wrath** is propitiated. Drawing on **Anselm** and **Calvin**, as well as contemporary analytic work on **expiation** and **liability transfer**, he defends the moral coherence of **penal substitution** against the charge of divine child abuse, adopting a **Trinitarian agency** account that locates the cross in the shared will of the **Triune God**. The resulting model portrays **grace** as costly and **justification** as a forensic act grounded in **union with Christ**, with sanctification following as the Spirit’s transformative work within a covenantal framework.

In soteriological debates Laing balances his **Molinist** providence with an account of **effectual calling** and **perseverance** that is biblically realist but not strictly **TULIP**. He affirms the necessity and priority of **grace**, the universality of the gospel call, and the assurance that flows from God’s preserving action, while construing **election** in terms compatible with **middle knowledge**. His ecclesiology is **Baptistic** and **evangelical**, seeing the church as a confessing community ruled by **Scripture**, ordered by **two ordinances**, and sent for **mission**. He treats **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper** as means of grace whose efficacy is tied to **Word and Spirit**, resisting both bare memorialism and ex opere operato sacramentalism. Across these loci, the analytic habit remains: conceptual clarity, careful argumentation, and a readiness to adjudicate objections using modal and moral analysis in service of evangelical orthodoxy.

A major area of Laing’s constructive engagement is **theodicy**. In his 2010 work on **Religious Epistemology and the Problem of Skepticism**, and subsequent essays on **God and evil**, he builds on **Plantinga’s free will defense** to argue that moral evil is a predictable entailment of **libertarian freedom** within a world ordered by **divine wisdom** toward greater-goods outcomes. He supplements this with **skeptical theism** to undercut the inference from inscrutable evils to the non-existence of God, and he attends pastorally to **suffering** by connecting the problem of evil to **Christ’s passion** and Christian **hope** in **resurrection** and **new creation**. The epistemic upshot is cautious confidence: while not all goods are trackable by finite agents, there is enough revealed light in **Scripture** and enough rational support from natural theology to sustain justified Christian belief amid profound affliction.

Laing’s 2014 **A Christian Apologetics Primer** consolidates his method for broader readership. Here the anchors are **classical theistic proofs**, the **historicity of the resurrection**, **reliability of the New Testament**, and moral knowledge grounded in a **divine nature** theory of moral value. He interacts with **new atheists** and with more philosophically sophisticated naturalists, pressing the **contingency argument**, **fine-tuning**, and the irreducibility of **consciousness**. He places the **gospels** within the horizon of **Greco-Roman biography** and Second Temple Judaism, arguing for **eyewitness testimony** and early **creedal tradition**. Across the whole, the apologetic is integrated with dogmatics: defending **orthodoxy** is not an extrinsic task but belongs to theology’s office of **serving the church’s witness**.

Laing also contributes to debates on **religious diversity** and **exclusivism**, engaging **John Hick** and **pluralist theologies**. He defends a **particularist Christology** and argues for **soft exclusivism** that recognizes general revelation and the Spirit’s universal work while maintaining the necessity of **Christ** and **gospel faith** for salvation. He uses resources from **Wolterstorff** on justice and **analytic metaphysics** to clarify the identity claims at stake in religious truth assertions, insisting that **contradictory claims** about God cannot all be true and that **tolerance** requires clarity rather than relativism. His stance is both pastoral and polemical, urging charitable engagement while protecting the scandalous particularity of **incarnation** and **atonement**.

The doctrine of the **Trinity** in Laing’s work is classically **Nicene** and **pro-Nicene**, with explicit commitments to **homoousios**, **inseparable operations**, and the taxis of **Father, Son, and Spirit**. He is wary of speculative models that perturb **divine simplicity** or collapse the **opera ad extra** into three distinct centers of agency. He defends **eternal generation** and **spiration**, reads **Scripture** with patristic sensitivity, and deploys analytic clarity to ward off social trinitarian excess. The doctrine functions dogmatically to underwrite the **economy of salvation** and hermeneutically to frame **Scripture** as triune discourse, thus tying **revelation**, **redemption**, and **communion** within a single theodramatic plot.

In pedagogy and ecclesial service, Laing models an evangelical **catechetical rationality**. He writes for students and pastors, curating **essays in evangelical theology** from 2005 to 2022 that address **creation**, **human nature**, **ethics**, and the **church’s public witness**. His **ethics** bears the imprint of **natural law** retrieval filtered through **Scripture**, leaning into virtues, moral norms, and prudence while engaging contested questions on **bioethics**, **sexual ethics**, and **political theology**. He argues that Christian moral discourse requires metaphysical commitments about **human teleology** and **imago Dei**, and that **public reasons** are possible for common life when grounded in a created moral order. The unity of his corpus lies in an evangelical confidence that **truth** is both revealed and rationally resilient.

In sum, Laing’s contribution is to consolidate a **faithfully evangelical, philosophically rigorous** mode of dogmatics and apologetics. He wields the instruments of **analytic clarity**, **classical theism**, and **scriptural authority** to formulate an account of **God**, **Scripture**, and **salvation** capable of navigating late-modern skepticism without retreating to fideism or capitulating to revisionism. His work demonstrates how **systematic theology** and **philosophy of religion** can be allied for the mission of the church, with **cumulative-case reasoning** and **reformed epistemology** operating as ministerial tools under the norm of **canon** and **creed**.

The Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation is appreciative but discriminating. Laing’s commitments to **inerrancy**, **classical theism**, **Nicene trinitarianism**, and a **penal substitutionary** soteriology substantially align with **classical Reformed orthodoxy**. Yet his **Molinist** account of **providence** sits uneasily beside **Reformed compatibilism** and the **covenantal** patterning of decree, creation, and redemption. A WTS approach, shaped by **Van Til’s** **covenantal epistemology**, would also question Laing’s reliance on a putatively neutral **natural theology** and call for explicit **analogical reasoning** that denies any common metaphysical platform between Creator and creature. Alternatives within Reformed theology would commend **metaphysical simplicity** with stronger **aseity**, **exemplarist** accounts of the moral law, and **effectual calling** grounded in **unconditional election**, while recasting apologetics within a **covenantally presuppositional** frame. Even so, the shared confession of **Scripture’s authority** and **God’s sovereignty** creates broad sympathy, and Laing’s analytic lucidity can be fruitfully appropriated when subordinated to a **Reformed doctrine of revelation** and **covenant**.
