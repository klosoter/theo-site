### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The career of **Graham Oppy** unfolds within the renewal of **analytic philosophy of religion** since the 1970s, where arguments for and against God were rigorously reconstructed by figures like **Alvin Plantinga** and **Richard Swinburne**. An Australian philosopher based at **Monash University**, Oppy was trained amid the ascendancy of **Quinean naturalism** and the modal rigor of **David Lewis**, a context that sharpened his commitment to **metaphysical economy** and **systematic theory comparison**. His intellectual project is to test **theism** and **naturalism** as rival global accounts against common standards of **theoretical virtues** such as **simplicity**, **coherence**, and **explanatory power**, with a persistent claim that **naturalism** is the simpler, no worse competitor. The late modern turn to formal modeling informed his appeal to **Bayesian confirmation** and to the comparative assessment of **intrinsic probability**, though he resists any pretense that precise priors can be non-arbitrary. In historical terms, Oppy represents the maturation of atheist philosophy of religion after mid-century logical positivism, advancing a positive **worldview naturalism** rather than mere negation, while conversing with the revived **perfect being theology** of analytic theists.

#### 2. Global comparison and intrinsic probability
Oppys method is not piecemeal refutation of isolated **theistic arguments** but a **global theory comparison** between comprehensive packages like **classical theism** and **metaphysical naturalism**. A recurring tool is the notion of **intrinsic probability**, a pre-evidential assessment that rates theories by **simplicity** and ontological cost. On this measure, **theism** postulates an additional sui generis, omnipotent, omniscient, and perfectly good agent, along with a deep structure of intentional, personal, and axiarchic facts. By contrast, **naturalism** posits only the natural world and its laws, a stance Oppy treats as ontologically spare. He claims that evidence from **science** and **ordinary experience** does not uniquely favor theism and so the higher **intrinsic probability** of naturalism should prevail in the absence of decisive theistic confirmation. The method yields an **epistemic parity** thesis for many disputes, yet Oppy thinks that parity breaks in favor of naturalism once one tallies overall commitments. He resists universal **Principle of Sufficient Reason** requirements, allowing **brute facts** at the widest explanatory boundary, and treats the **B-theory of time** as friendly to naturalist cosmology and unhelpful to **Kalam-style** theism.

#### 3. Ontological arguments and perfect being commitments
Oppys first major monograph, **Ontological Arguments and Belief in God** published in 1995, offers a map and diagnosis of **ontological arguments** from **Anselm** to contemporary modal versions associated with **Plantinga** and **Gödel**. His central claim is that all such arguments either surreptitiously embed the conclusion within their premises or rely on controversial modal or conceptual assumptions that opponents have no reason to grant. The key charge is **question-begging** at the level of possibility assignments. If one accepts that a maximally great being is possibly instantiated, a modal S5 axiom can rush to actual existence, but the same abstract modality can be used to generate **parody arguments** for impossible beings or for necessarily non-existent beings. Oppy concludes that **perfect being theology** does not yield existential payoff without antecedent theological commitments. The book thus inaugurates his wider strategy: show that purported direct entailments from a priori reflection about **great-making properties** to **theistic existence** cannot be secured without costs that neutralize any supposed gain.

#### 4. Arguing about Gods and the fate of theistic proofs
With **Arguing about Gods** in 2006, Oppy broadened his canvas to a comprehensive analysis of **cosmological**, **teleological**, **moral**, **religious experience**, and **miracle** arguments. The argumentative rhythm is constant. For each purported proof or strong inductive case, there exist naturalistic rivals that match the data while incurring fewer theoretical commitments. Against **cosmological arguments**, he challenges the applicability of **causal principles** at the totality level and denies that an explanatory regress must terminate in a personal **necessary being**. Against **teleological design** claims, he argues that appeals to **order**, **fine-tuning**, or **biological complexity** either do not raise the posterior probability of theism over naturalism or else introduce auxiliary assumptions that lower intrinsic probability. Against **moral arguments**, he presses that metaethical realism can be combined with **naturalism**, and that positing a divine moral legislator merely relocates normativity rather than explaining it. Testimony to **miracles** and reports of **religious experience** are assessed through general criteria governing testimonial reliability, background regularities, and competing explanations, leading to the verdict that theistic gains are offset by heightened prior burdens. The book codifies his thesis that there are no **knockdown arguments**, only cumulative trade-offs, and that in the overall trade ledger **naturalism** is superior.

#### 5. Cosmology, the Kalam, and brute fact origins
Oppy devotes considerable energy to the **Kalam cosmological argument** championed by **William Lane Craig**, especially the premises that an actual infinite cannot exist and that the universe began to exist. Oppy rejects the inference from **Hilberts hotel** to metaphysical impossibility, distinguishes mathematical counterintuitions from metaphysical contradictions, and underscores that modern cosmology does not foreclose models with past infinity or with no first instant. He emphasizes that **quantum cosmology**, candidate **no-boundary** proposals, and agnosticism about time at Planck scales deprive Kalam premises of firm scientific support. More importantly for metaphysics, he thinks the causal principle underwriting Kalam smuggles in a local generalization as a global necessity, whereas a **brute fact cosmology** is not incoherent. When put in global comparison, a theistic explanation of the beginning introduces a new category of **agent-causation** and a cluster of divine attributes whose complexity reduces **intrinsic probability**. By contrast, allowing that the **cosmos** just is, or that there is a naturalistic modal backdrop without a further reason, fares better on Oppys simplicity ledger. He grants that this invites austere ultimate facts, but takes this to be a virtue rather than a vice.

#### 6. Fine-tuning, multiverse, and theoretical costs
In reply to the **fine-tuning argument** developed by figures like **Robin Collins** and defended in physics by **Luke Barnes**, Oppy insists that the relevant comparison class includes **naturalistic multiverse hypotheses** as well as more modest anthropic reasoning within a single-universe framework. The central claim is that the data of life-permitting parameter ranges does not strongly favor **theism** over **naturalism**, since any boost in fit achieved by theism is tempered by its higher **intrinsic complexity** and by open-ended degrees of freedom in specifying divine purposes. Theistic models require auxiliary assumptions about what a perfect deity would aim to produce and by which means, and these background choices lower prior probability. By contrast, **multiverse** or measure-theoretic approaches, though not simple in one sense, are licensed by independent theoretical moves in fundamental physics and retain the key **naturalist** virtue that no new sui generis category is introduced. The upshot is that even the most promising contemporary design datum does not break the **epistemic standoff**, and on Oppys calculus the **naturalistic package** remains better.

#### 7. Describing Gods, reinvention of the field, and the best argument against God
In **Describing Gods** from 2014, Oppy turns from epistemology to metaphysics, probing the coherence of divine attributes like **omniscience**, **omnipotence**, **aseity**, **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **eternity**. He reconstructs families of doctrines using conceptual resources from **perfect being theology** and then tests them for internal tension. Problems include variants of the **omnipotence paradox**, questions about divine knowledge of indexicals and counterfactuals, and the specter of **modal collapse** faced by robust **divine simplicity** accounts. Oppy does not claim decisive incoherence for all classical models, but he argues that making the set consistent requires extensive metaphysical machinery and nontrivial costs. In **Reinventing Philosophy of Religion** also in 2014, he urges a more methodologically integrated field that places **worldview comparison** and **theoretical virtue** assessment at its center, in contrast to dogmatic apologetic or anti-apologetic projects. The monograph **The Best Argument against God** from 2013 sums his positive thesis: the best case for **atheism** is not a single proof but a demonstration that **naturalism** is the best total theory once we compare priors and likelihoods over all the data we have, including consciousness, morality, religious practices, and the success of science. The negative aim and the positive worldview are thus fused.

#### 8. Epistemology, Reformed epistemology, and rational disagreement
Oppy has been a persistent critic of **Plantinga-style Reformed epistemology**, which defends **properly basic theistic belief** grounded in a **sensus divinitatis**. He grants that religious communities may in fact form beliefs in such a basic manner, but denies that this confers **epistemic warrant** without independent calibration of sources and defeater-resistance. He thinks the deliverances of a purported **sensus divinitatis** conflict across traditions, face the empirical problem of **divine hiddenness** articulated by **J. L. Schellenberg**, and are intelligible as by-products of our cognitive architecture within **naturalism**. Oppy is unpersuaded by **Pascalian wager** pragmatics, pointing to decision-theoretic fragilities and the pluralism of options. He is equally skeptical of strong **evidentialist** demands that would disallow rational theism absent proofs. On his view the situation is one of **rational disagreement** under deep underdetermination, though he contends that the superiority of **naturalism** emerges in global comparison once the cost of divine attributes and explanation is reckoned. He rejects any epistemic obligation to accept a universal **PSR**, contending that the possibility of **brute facts** is not an epistemic flaw but a live option for ultimate explanation.

#### 9. Interlocutors, debates, and editorial leadership
Across debates with **William Lane Craig** on the **Kalam**, with **Alexander Pruss** and **Robert Koons** on the **PSR** and **Leibnizian cosmological arguments**, with **Joshua Rasmussen** in the 2019 dialogue **Is God the Best Explanation of Things**, and with **Robin Collins** on **fine-tuning**, Oppy has modeled analytical clarity and comparative patience. He has engaged **Swinburnes** Bayesian theism by challenging the assignment of priors and the appropriateness of personal explanations at the cosmic level. Within the academy he has edited the **Routledge Handbook of Contemporary Philosophy of Religion** in 2015 and **A Companion to Atheism and Philosophy** in 2019, mapping the field beyond narrow apologetics to broader metaphysical and methodological debates. He has also written **Atheism: The Basics** in 2018, a lucid primer that distills his mature naturalist stance for wider audiences. His influence is evident in the normalization of **naturalism** as a structured competitor in philosophy of religion, the codification of **intrinsic probability** as a shared metric, and the recognition that religious epistemology must squarely face **theoretical cost accounting**. By elevating the debate from isolated proofs to **worldview comparison**, Oppy has reoriented what counts as progress in the field.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed or WTS** vantage, Oppys project compels clear articulation of first principles. He presupposes that **theoretical virtues** like **simplicity** and **intrinsic probability** are religiously neutral arbiters. Classical **Reformed theology** denies such neutrality, insisting that all reasoning is covenantally situated under **revelation** and the **creator–creature distinction**. The **principium essendi** is the triune **Lord**, not the world, and the **principium cognoscendi** is **self-authenticating Scripture** attended by the Spirit. Oppys license for **brute facts** collides with a covenantal **PSR** that is not a metaphysical necessity abstracted from God but the confession that in God there is no unexplained remainder and that every creaturely event is purposively ordered by **providence**. His appeal to **intrinsic probability** treats God as an optional hypothesis appended to a neutral core, whereas **divine aseity** and **autotheos** require that all facts are what they are by the sovereign will and wisdom of the triune God. The Reformed critique grants that no **knockdown arguments** compel assent but contends that Oppys **naturalistic parsimony** undercuts the metaphysical ground of **logic**, **morality**, and **induction**, which on Reformed accounts are covenantal reflections of **divine wisdom**, **goodness**, and **faithfulness**. A **transcendental, covenantal argument** would invert Oppys comparison. The problem is not that God is an extra entity that bloats priors, but that apart from the **self-revealing Creator**, there is no principled reason why there is an orderly creation whose structures make science and rational inquiry possible. The alternative proposed within **classical Reformed orthodoxy** is not evidential accumulation to beat the priors, but a **Scripture-governed, analogical knowledge of God** that accounts for reality as a theater of the **covenant**. On this stance, divine **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **providence** are not theoretical costs but the very conditions of intelligibility.
