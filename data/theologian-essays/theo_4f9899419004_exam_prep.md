### TITLE
Huldrych Zwingli is the pioneering yet one-sided Swiss Reformer whose Word-centered humanism, memorialist sacramentology, and civic ecclesiology set trajectories that Reformed orthodoxy had to correct as much as inherit.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Huldrych Zwingli** 1484–1531 ministers in **Swiss humanist** and early **Reformation** networks, centered in **Zurich** amid conflicts with the **Swiss Confederation** and Roman Church.
- Trained in **Erasmian humanism** and steeped in **Renaissance philology**, he applies *ad fontes* methods to **Scripture** and patristic texts as the engine of reform.

- His method is rigorously **biblicist**, insisting on the perspicuity and sufficiency of **Scripture** read in the original languages for reform in doctrine and worship.
- He elevates **reason** as a gift of **Gods common grace**, often stressing moral and civic clarity, while distrusting speculative **Scholastic theology**.
- He reads **providence** and **history** as a unified divine drama, folding **church** and **city** into one visible Christendom under the preached Word.

- In the **Sixty-Seven Articles** 1523 he lays out core theses of reform, centering **Christ** alone, Scripture alone, and a sharp rejection of Roman sacramentalism.
- In **Commentary on True and False Religion** 1525 he argues for sovereign **providence**, the vanity of idolatry, and a strongly rational critique of false worship.
- In **On the Lord’s Supper** 1526 and later disputations he articulates his **memorialist** reading of the Supper over against Luther’s **sacramental union**.
- In his **Fidei Ratio** 1530 and Marburg writings he defends a covenantal, predominantly symbolic **sacramentology** and a civic understanding of the **church**.

- His theology is decisive for later Reformed doctrine of **Scripture and worship**, especially the **regulative principle** and iconoclasm.
- He is central for debates over the **sacraments** and **church and state**, including paedobaptism, Christendom, and the boundaries of the visible church.
- His strong doctrine of **providence and election** influences later **Reformed** articulations, though with less systematic elaboration than **Calvin**.

- A Westminster committee will press how to affirm Zwinglis **Word-centered reform** while clearly rejecting his **memorialist** reduction of the Supper.
- They will expect careful differentiation between Zwinglis civic **Christendom** model and a confessional **Reformed ecclesiology** shaped by the **Confessions**.

- In discussion of the Supper one must compare **Zwingli vs Luther** and then triangulate with **Calvin** as a mediating yet distinct Reformed voice.
- For method and church–state issues comparisons to **Erasmus vs Zwingli** and **Zwingli vs Bucer** help situate his humanism and civic ecclesiology.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Huldrych **Zwingli**, born 1484 in Wildhaus and killed in battle in 1531 at **Kappel**, stands at the crossroads of **Renaissance humanism** and the early **Reformation**. Educated in Basel, Bern, and Vienna, and deeply influenced by **Erasmus** and the *ad fontes* movement, he mastered Greek and Latin and absorbed the moralistic, reformist impulse of northern humanism. As a priest in **Glarus** and later **Einsiedeln**, he preached against mercenary service and ecclesiastical abuses while immersing himself in the **Greek New Testament**. His call to Zurich in 1519 placed him at the center of Swiss political and ecclesial life, where the **Great Minster** pulpit gave him a platform to reshape the city. The driving problem for Zwingli is how the church and commonwealth of a Christian city can be brought wholly under the lordship of **Christ** through the pure preaching of the **Word** and the removal of unscriptural traditions.

The key crisis that crystallized this was the conflict with late medieval **Roman Catholicism** over authority, sacraments, and ecclesial power. In his **Sixty-Seven Articles** of 1523, debated at Zurichs first disputation, Zwingli insists that **Scripture** alone is the rule of faith and life, that **Christ** alone is mediator, and that the mass, images, and monastic vows are contrary to the gospel. The underlying problem is not only doctrinal corruption but the captivity of the **church** to human ordinances that enslave consciences and distort civic life. Zwingli therefore aims at a total reordering of Zurichs worship and social order so that nothing is practiced without biblical warrant. His reforming energy is directed less at building a dogmatic system, as in later **Reformed scholasticism**, and more at purging a visible Christendom of idolatry and restoring the supremacy of **Gods Word** in pulpit and polity.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Zwinglis method is a distinctly **humanist biblicism**. Trained by **Erasmus** to read the text critically, he begins his Zurich ministry in 1519 with continuous expository preaching through **Matthew**, then Acts, Pauline letters, and other books, confident that the plain sense of **Scripture** in the original languages can reform church and city. Revelation for Zwingli is principally the written **Word of God**, publicly proclaimed and rationally understood. In his **Commentary on True and False Religion** 1525 he attacks images and ceremonies precisely because they substitute sense-based religion for the verbal revelation of the true God. He has relatively little interest in speculative metaphysics; theology is the exposition of the **biblical text** for the sake of moral and ecclesial reform.

Reason holds a significant, though subordinated, role in his method. Zwingli speaks of **ratio** as a gift of **God**, even available among pagans, that can discern many moral truths and perceive a single divine providence over history. In the **Commentary on True and False Religion** he famously suggests that some pre-Christian figures like **Socrates** and **Seneca** may be in heaven, not through natural virtue, but through the hidden working of Christ known by faith given outside ordinary means. This is often pressed in exams as a test case for his view of general revelation and **salvation**. While he never denies the necessity of **Christ** and grace, he pushes toward a generous reading of the scope of divine mercy, coupled with a rational critique of idolatry and superstition. The tension with later **Reformed** method lies in his readiness to blur the sharp practical boundary between the church as the sphere of covenant means and the broader world as the field of Gods secret providence.

Zwingli also has a distinctive understanding of **church** and **history**. For him, the church is visibly embodied in the reformed **city**, and history is the unfolding of **Gods providence** over peoples and nations. He does not sharply separate redemptive history from general history as later **Vosian** biblical theology would, but treats biblical and civic narratives in a relatively continuous way. The Zurich city council functions as the instrument through which the Word reforms the city, so Zwingli places considerable theological weight on public disputations, civic decrees, and the orderly implementation of reforms. Tradition, for him, is valuable when it is ancient and patristic, yet it must yield to **Scripture** whenever there is conflict. He esteems the **Fathers**, especially **Augustine**, but reads them as early exegetes rather than as normative magisterial authorities. This produces a straightforward, sometimes stark, method: Scripture in its literal sense, aided by reason and humanist philology, mediated through the reformed city church.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is *sola Scriptura* with a rich doctrine of inspiration, clarity, sufficiency, and authority, as codified later in the **Westminster Confession** and already anticipated in **Luther** and **Calvin**. Zwingli strongly anticipates this by insisting that **Scripture alone** is the norm for doctrine and worship. The **Sixty-Seven Articles** 1523 declare that the holy gospel is the whole truth and that any teaching not grounded in it is to be rejected. Against Roman tradition and even against some cautious humanists like **Erasmus**, he refuses any independent norming role for unwritten traditions. Yet he does not offer a worked-out doctrine of Scripture on the level of later **Reformed scholastics** such as **Turretin**. His biblicism tends toward a direct appeal from text to practice, trusting perspicuity and fearing all mediation through complex dogmatic formulations. A Westminster examiner will appreciate his *sola Scriptura* impulse but will note that his underdeveloped doctrine of inspiration and canon leaves later Reformed theology to supply needed depth on **revelation** as a covenantal, triune act.

Second, in the locus of **sacraments**, the classic confessional baseline is that sacraments are visible words and true means of grace, effectual not ex opere operato but by the Spirit and faith, with a real spiritual communion with **Christ** in the Supper. Zwingli, in his **On the Lords Supper** 1526 and in the **Marburg Colloquy** 1529 debates with **Luther**, stresses almost exclusively the memorial and confessional aspects of the Supper. For him the words "This is my body" signify "This signifies my body," so the bread and wine are signs that call to remembrance Christs once-for-all sacrifice and seal the believers allegiance. He rejects both the Roman **transubstantiation** and Luthers **sacramental union**, arguing that the glorified body of Christ is in heaven and cannot be locally present in many places on earth. The Supper, in his view, strengthens faith as we remember and confess, yet it does not convey grace in a distinct way beyond the preaching of the **Word**. This memorialist sacramentology is the major point where later Reformed figures like **Calvin** and **Bucer** seek to correct him by retrieving a strong doctrine of the Spirit-mediated real presence without lapsing into Lutheran or Roman errors.

Third, in the locus of **church and state**, the classic Reformed baseline, seen in later **Confessions**, distinguishes the spiritual government of the church from the civil magistrate, while affirming that magistrates must protect true religion. Zwingli pioneers a model of **civic Reformation** in Zurich where city council and clergy are intertwined. In the **Sixty-Seven Articles** and subsequent disputations he treats the Zurich council as the arena where truth is debated and enforced. The church is largely coterminous with the reformed city, and excommunication is implemented through civic sanctions rather than purely ecclesiastical discipline. His conflicts with the **Anabaptists**, especially over **baptism** and church membership, expose this model: he insists on infant baptism as the sign of belonging to the Christian commonwealth, whereas the Anabaptists demand a gathered church of professing believers. Zwingli defends paedobaptism in writings like his **Refutation of the Tricks of the Baptists** 1527 by appealing to the unity of the covenants and the inclusion of children. However, his tight alignment of church and state and his role in the suppression of **Anabaptists** mark a civic Christendom model that later Reformed thinkers, especially in the **Dutch** and **Presbyterian** traditions, will significantly modify.

Fourth, in the locus of **providence, predestination, and faith**, the classic Reformed baseline is a robust doctrine of Gods sovereign decree, double predestination, and faith as a Spirit-given instrument, as later refined by **Calvin** and **Westminster**. Zwingli articulates a strong doctrine of **providence** and election in his **Commentary on True and False Religion** and further in **Fidei Ratio** 1530, written for **Charles V**. He insists that God orders all events, including human choices, and that salvation depends entirely on Gods gracious election in **Christ**, not on human merit. His confidence in sovereignty undergirds his willingness to see even war and political turmoil as instruments of divine judgment. At the same time, his broad language about the salvation of some outside the visible church, and his optimistic appraisal of **reason** among pagans, create an unusual combination: very high **predestination** with a relatively hopeful universality of Gods reach. Later Reformed theology will applaud his affirmation of sovereignty while tightening the connection between covenant means, the visible church, and the ordo salutis so that confidence in **grace** is not detached from Word and sacrament.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical **Reformed orthodoxy** both builds on and corrects Zwingli. **Calvin** explicitly honors him as an early instrument of reform yet criticizes his doctrine of the **Lords Supper** as too bare and rational. In *Institutes* book 4 and in his polemics with **Westphal**, Calvin seeks a via media between **Lutheran** corporealism and **Zwinglian** memorialism, insisting on a real spiritual feeding on Christ by the Spirit. **Bucer** similarly integrates a richer ecclesiology and sacramentology than Zwingli provided, and later figures like **Bullinger** develop the **covenant** theme in ways more systematic than Zwinglis civic focus. By the time of **Turretin** and **Witsius**, the Reformed tradition has absorbed Zwinglis *sola Scriptura* dependence and his anti-idolatry zeal, while decisively rejecting his thin account of sacramental efficacy.

From a Westminster vantage point there are at least two points where one must object. First, Zwinglis **memorialist** sacramentology stands in tension with the **Westminster Confession** teaching that the Supper is a true means of grace and that worthy receivers genuinely feed upon Christ by faith. Second, his close identification of **church and state** in a single civic Christendom sits uneasily with the Confessions more careful two-kingdoms language and with later **Presbyterian** commitments to ministerial independence in doctrinal matters. Yet there are also clear places to learn from him. His humanist insistence on rigorous **exegesis**, original languages, and plain preaching as the heart of reform is exemplary for Reformed ministry. His fearless iconoclasm and commitment to removing unbiblical ceremonies anticipate the **regulative principle of worship** and remind Reformed churches of the constant danger of drifting into traditionalism. In this way, the Reformed tradition both honors Zwingli as a first-generation Reformer and treats his work as a partial and sometimes imbalanced beginning that demands completion in the fuller catholic **Reformed** synthesis of later centuries.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, a safe opening sentence is to say that **Huldrych Zwingli** is the first major Swiss **Reformer** whose Word-centered, humanist-driven program of civic reform laid crucial but incomplete foundations for later Reformed theology. That line signals both appreciation and critical distance, which a Westminster committee will expect. It is also safe to say that he represents a strong **sola Scriptura** impulse, a radical attack on idolatry, and a pioneering but deficient memorialist account of the **Lords Supper** that both **Calvin** and the confessions explicitly correct. One can describe his ecclesiology as a form of reformed **Christendom**, with church and city deeply intertwined under the rule of the Word.

There are phrases that must be avoided or carefully qualified. You should not simply say that Zwingli held to a purely "symbolic" or "empty" view of the **sacraments**, since he believed they truly seal and confirm faith, even if not as means of grace in the later **Reformed** sense. Better to say that he offered a predominantly **memorial and declarative** understanding of the Supper, with inadequate emphasis on the Spirits instrumentality. You must avoid the suggestion that he teaches **universalism** when you mention his hopeful comments about **Socrates** or pagans, and instead clarify that he affirmed **predestination** and the necessity of Christ, but speculated about extraordinary operations of grace outside ordinary means. Do not speak of him as if he had a full-blown **two-kingdoms** doctrine; his model is an integrated civic church, not the careful distinction later made by Reformed orthodoxy.

Examiners often exploit two misunderstandings. First, many students flatten the contrast to **Luther** into a simple rationalist versus realist dichotomy, as if Zwingli were just a cold intellectual. You should note that while he does emphasize **reason** and logic in his exegesis, he is a passionate pastor and a martyr who dies on the battlefield, and his concern is to safeguard Christs ascension and the sufficiency of the once-for-all sacrifice. Second, students frequently forget his importance beyond the Supper, especially his contributions to the **regulative principle of worship**, his early Reformed doctrine of **providence**, and his role in shaping attitudes to **Anabaptists** and ecclesial discipline. Being ready to name **Sixty-Seven Articles**, **Commentary on True and False Religion**, and **On the Lords Supper** with dates, plus the **Marburg Colloquy** and his conflict with **Luther**, shows mastery. The landmine is to praise him without qualification on the Supper or to dismiss him as a mere precursor to Calvin; the examiners want to see you affirm what is genuinely Reformed while drawing clear confessional lines where he must be corrected.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Zwingli is a God-given pioneer whose **Word-centered** reform, insistence on the sufficiency of **Scripture**, and zeal to purge idolatry and human traditions from worship deserve strong affirmation, yet whose memorialist **sacramentology** and tight fusion of church and city must be clearly rejected as falling short of confessional Reformed doctrine. His robust teaching on **providence** and election anticipates central Reformed themes, but his speculative generosity about salvation outside the visible church and his underdeveloped account of the means of grace require us to subordinate him to the fuller synthesis of **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and the **Westminster Standards**. If asked where I land, I would say that I gladly stand with Zwingli in his scriptural zeal and iconoclastic courage, while decisively aligning with classical Reformed orthodoxy rather than with Zwinglian memorialism on the Supper and rather than with his civic Christendom on the relation of **church and state**.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Huldrych **Zwingli** is the first major Swiss Reformer whose humanist, Word-centered program reshaped Zurich and forced later Reformed theology to refine his sacramentology and ecclesiology.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- **1484–1531**: Zwingli is born in Wildhaus, ministers in Glarus and Einsiedeln, then leads reform in **Zurich** until his death in battle at **Kappel**.
- In **Sixty-Seven Articles** 1523 Zwingli sets out his core **Reformation** theses on Scripture, Christ, and the rejection of Roman abuses.
- In **Commentary on True and False Religion** 1525 and **On the Lords Supper** 1526 he develops his doctrines of **providence**, idolatry, and a memorialist Supper.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Zwingli practices an **Erasmian humanist** method, reading **Scripture** in the original languages and trusting its plain sense to reform church and city.
- He views **reason** as a gracious gift of God that aids in recognizing idolatry and moral truth, while subordinating it to biblical revelation.
- He interprets **history** and **church** life together, seeing the reformed city council as the instrument through which the Word orders public and ecclesial existence.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Zwingli insists on **sola Scriptura**, rejecting any binding authority of tradition apart from **Scripture**, as articulated in the **Sixty-Seven Articles**.
- He advances a predominantly **memorialist** view of the **Lords Supper**, denying any bodily presence of Christ on earth and opposing **Luthers** sacramental union.
- He develops a strong doctrine of **providence and predestination**, teaching that God ordains all things and that salvation rests on divine election in **Christ**.
- His **ecclesiology** fuses church and city, with the Zurich council enforcing reform, and he defends **infant baptism** as the sign of belonging to the Christian commonwealth.
- He champions an iconoclastic, **regulative** approach to worship, attacking images, the mass, and unscriptural ceremonies in the **Commentary on True and False Religion**.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press Zwinglis **memorialist** sacramentology, since the Confession teaches the Supper as a true means of grace and spiritual feeding on **Christ**.
- They will question his close alignment of **church and state**, contrasting it with more developed Reformed distinctions between ecclesiastical and civil power.
- They will probe his comments on pagan **salvation** and reason, asking how his optimism fits with Reformed teaching on effectual calling and the visible church.
- They will note his underdeveloped doctrine of **Scripture** compared to later Reformed orthodoxy, which more fully articulates inspiration, canon, and revelation.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Zwingli vs Luther** on the Lords Supper contrasts a memorialist, ascension-protecting view with a corporeal real presence and sacramental union.
- **Zwingli vs Calvin** on sacramentology contrasts Zwinglis mainly symbolic view with Calvins Spirit-mediated real communion with **Christ**.
- **Erasmus vs Zwingli** contrasts moralistic, irenic humanism with reforming humanism that subordinates learning to **Reformation** by the Word.
- **Zwingli vs Anabaptists** contrasts a civic, paedobaptist Christendom ecclesiology with a gathered believers church and rejection of infant baptism.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Zwingli is an essential yet provisional Reformer whose rigorous Scripturalism and iconoclasm we must honor, while consciously preferring the richer sacramental and ecclesial balance of classical **Reformed orthodoxy** over his memorialist and civic Christendom models.
