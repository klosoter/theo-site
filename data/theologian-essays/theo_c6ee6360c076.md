### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Simon Chan emerged in late twentieth-century Singapore as a **Pentecostal theologian** who refused the dichotomy between **evangelical biblicism** and the **catholic spiritual tradition**. Working from the 1990s into the 2010s at **Trinity Theological College, Singapore** and editing the **Asian Journal of Theology**, he stood at the crossroads of **global Christianity’s southward shift** and the vibrancy of **Asian grassroots religion**. The Asian horizon meant that questions of **ancestor veneration**, **spirit powers**, **healing and blessing**, and **communal identity** were not tangential but constitutive. Chan’s central wager was methodological: the church’s **worship as theologia prima** shapes and yields doctrine, so the way forward for a young Asian church was neither to mimic Western scholasticism nor to dissolve into religious pluralism, but to retrieve the **Great Tradition** with Pentecostal openness to the **Holy Spirit**. He names **lex orandi, lex credendi** as a structuring axiom, and he leverages a **sacramental ontology** that resists thin spiritualities and disembodied belief. Under the influence of **Alexander Schmemann’s** liturgical vision and **John Zizioulas’s** ecclesial-personal ontology, Chan crafts an approach where the **church as worshiping community** becomes the primary site of theological knowledge, an epistemic stance he deploys against both secular modernity and elite theological projects in Asia.

Chan’s formation is also ascetical. Drawing deeply from the **Eastern ascetical tradition** and **patristic spiritual theology**, he retrieves the threefold way of **purgation, illumination, and union** as a grammar of sanctification. This retrieval works alongside Pentecostal emphases on **Spirit baptism**, **charisms**, and **spiritual warfare**. He holds together the **kerygmatic center of the gospel** with the **habitus of prayer**, so that theology becomes a churchly wisdom, not merely an academic exercise. Methodologically, in Chan’s hands, theology is shaped by **ecclesial practices** of **Eucharist**, **daily prayer**, **fasting**, and **discernment of spirits**, and it reads culture with a **missional-pastoral** rather than merely theoretical aim.

#### 2. Spiritual theology and Pentecostal retrieval
The early landmark, **Spiritual Theology** 1998, shows Chan’s constructive voice at full tilt. He offers a comprehensive account of the **Christian life** that threads **Scripture**, **patristic wisdom**, and **Pentecostal spirituality** into a cohesive whole. He treats **prayer and contemplation**, **ascetic disciplines**, **virtues**, **discernment**, and **charisms** within a catholic framework. Importantly, he places **theosis** at the horizon of sanctification, not as an exotic Eastern import, but as an intensification of **union with Christ** by the **Holy Spirit**, translated for pastoral formation. The book argues that the Spirit’s sanctifying work reconfigures desire and perception so that Christians acquire a **sacramental way of seeing**, discerning God’s presence in the church’s **rites**, **Scripture proclaimed**, and the **Eucharist**. The integration of **desert monastic wisdom** with **Pentecostal fervor** is programmatic; Chan contends that the Spirit that gives glossolalia also trains the church in **apatheia** rightly understood as ordered passion under charity.

This ascetical-liturgy nexus is expanded in **Pentecostal Theology and the Christian Spiritual Tradition** 2000. Here Chan contends that **classical Pentecostalism** is not a novelty set over against tradition, but a renewal within the one **catholic spiritual heritage**. He reads **Spirit baptism** in relation to **sanctification** and **charisms** so that the gifts do not commodify the Spirit but are attached to the church’s **holiness** and **mission**. He resists the **prosperity gospel** by grounding blessing in the cross-shaped life of **Christus Victor**, where deliverance and healing live within the church’s penitential and eucharistic life. He also explores **discernment of spirits** as a recovery of patristic warfare spirituality, refusing both secular reductionism and sensationalism. Theologically, he insists that the **Spirit’s oikonomia** binds pneumatic experience to the **Trinitarian economy**, pushing Pentecostalism into deeper fellowship with the **patristic Trinity** and the **creedal rule of faith**.

#### 3. Liturgical theology and ecclesial identity
The constructive heart of Chan’s ecclesiology appears in **Liturgical Theology: The Church as Worshiping Community** 2006. The book’s thesis is crisp: worship is constitutive of the church’s being, so reform of theology in Asia must begin with **reform of worship**. Echoing **Schmemann** and **Aidan Kavanagh**, Chan argues that **lex orandi, lex credendi** is not a slogan but an epistemic ordering. Doctrine arises from the church’s **eucharistic anamnesis**, where the Spirit conforms a people to Christ’s paschal mystery. He proposes a thick **sacramental ontology** in which the **Eucharist** is the church’s defining act, shaping a communal identity that resists consumerist spirituality and nationalistic myth. For a Pentecostal context, this means relocating **charisms** from the spontaneity of revivalist meetings into the **ordered liturgy**, so that gifts build up the body under the sign of the **one bread and one cup**.

The book is also corrective. Chan criticizes the free-form **low-church liturgies** that inadvertently catechize a thin gospel and shallow ecclesiology. He calls for **weekly Eucharist**, catechumenal processes, and robust **daily prayer** to anchor the community. He uses **Zizioulas’s** notion of **being as communion** to argue that personhood is ecclesial, but he resists collapsing identity into ontology by insisting on mission. He reads **mission from worship**, contending that the church’s **koinonia** is the primary witness in a fragmented Asian urban landscape. The result is a proposal that is ecumenically catholic, yet distinctly **Pentecostal** in its attentiveness to the **Spirit’s charisms**, now choreographed within the church’s **ordo**. The argument carries both doctrinal and pastoral force, since it binds **catechesis** to **liturgy**, and **ethics** to **Eucharistic formation**.

#### 4. Grassroots Asia, folk religion, and doctrinal transposition
The volume **Grassroots Asian Theology: Thinking the Faith from the Ground Up** 2014 pivots from ecclesial retrieval to contextual dogmatics. Chan maps how **Asian popular Christianity** operates with lived categories of **power**, **blessing**, **healing**, **family**, and **ancestors**. He criticizes elite academic projects associated with **C. S. Song**, **Aloysius Pieris**, and strands of **interreligious pluralism**, arguing that these often bypass the actual piety of ordinary believers. He engages **Andrew Walls’s** analysis of the **serial expansion of Christianity** to insist that the gospel must indwell Asian cultures from below, not by syncretism but by **transposition into catholic patterns**. Two proposals deserve special notice. First, Chan retrieves the **communion of saints** as a doctrinal resource to interpret **ancestor veneration**. He does not baptize ancestral rites wholesale; rather, he reframes the longing for filial continuity within the church’s **Eucharistic memorial** and the intercessory solidarity of the living and the dead in Christ. Second, he deploys **Christus Victor** and **spiritual warfare** to address widespread fear of spirits, arguing that exorcism and deliverance belong, not to marginal ministries, but to the church’s **pastoral care** and **liturgical prayer** anchored in the **paschal victory**.

Chan’s method of **grassroots theology** raises classical questions of **inculturation** and **doctrinal development**. He leans on **ressourcement** to police the boundaries of contextual creativity. The canon of **Scripture**, the **ecumenical creeds**, and the **historic liturgies** form the regula that disciplines Asian theological imagination. Yet he also insists that doctrine is not static; it migrates conceptually when the gospel translates into new social imaginaries. Terms like **theosis** are thus repurposed to teach Asian Christians that salvation is more than legal acquittal, it is participation in Christ by the **Spirit**, forming a people holy and healed. To this end, he encourages **catechesis** that names spirit powers and calls believers into **ascetical practices** appropriate to urban Asia, such as fasting from status-seeking and mammon, as extensions of classical **askesis**.

#### 5. Pneumatology, Christology, and the order of salvation
Across these works, Chan articulates an integrative **pneumatology** tied to **Christology** and **ecclesiology**. He traffics in a **Spirit Christology** attentive to Luke-Acts, but he refuses to detach the Spirit’s agency from the **homoousios** confession of Nicaea. In soteriology he threads **justification** and **sanctification** with **theosis**, resisting a polarity between forensic and participatory accounts. The Spirit who unites believers to Christ pours out **charisms** for the building up of the **one body**, and the **Eucharist** is the rhythmic enactment of this union. Chan’s ordo salutis thus has a pronounced **ecclesial shape**. **Spirit baptism** is neither collapsed into conversion nor made a second blessing as an experiential badge; rather, he tends to align the fullness of the Spirit with the church’s **initiation** and **ongoing liturgical life**, echoing ancient patterns of **baptism, chrismation, and Eucharist**. This sacramental framing allows him to rein in Pentecostal individualism while preserving expectancy for **prophecy**, **healing**, and **discernment**.

At the same time, Chan’s **spiritual warfare** motif ensures that soteriology speaks to Asian fears and hopes. He argues that the **exorcistic authority of Christ** and the church’s **deliverance ministry** should be integrated into ordinary pastoral care. Theologically, this is anchored in **Christus Victor** rather than in a dualistic cosmology; the powers are defeated in the cross and resurrection. Practically, liturgical **intercessions**, regular **confession of sin**, and pastoral **anointing with oil** serve as normative contexts for spiritual conflict. His synthesis keeps together **ascetic struggle**, **sacramental grace**, and **charismatic expectation** under the governance of the **Trinitarian economy**.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and distinctive stances
Chan’s work is dialogical. With **Schmemann** he affirms the **sacramentality of the world** as unveiled in liturgy, though he accents **spiritual warfare** more explicitly than Orthodox sources. With **Zizioulas** he champions **being as communion**, yet he is careful to feature **mission** so that koinonia does not become an end in itself. With **Amos Yong** he shares a **pneumatological imagination**, but he is more guarded about **religious pluralism**, preferring ecclesial catechesis over pneumatological hospitality as a bridge to other faiths. With **Frank Macchia** he shares concern to integrate **Spirit baptism** with **ecclesiology**, while pressing more strongly the **liturgical** contours. In Asia he engages **Aloysius Pieris** and **C. S. Song**, appreciating their attention to poverty and culture while criticizing an over-accommodating posture to non-Christian religions that blurs the **confession of Christ’s uniqueness**. In global mission studies he benefits from **Andrew Walls’s** thesis on translation and indigenization, taking it as warrant for **grassroots theology** that re-voices classical doctrine in Asian vernacular.

Distinctively, Chan’s use of the **communion of saints** to navigate **ancestor veneration** sets him apart in Protestant circles. He argues that Protestant neglect of the doctrine has left a pastoral vacuum in Asia, which folk practices fill. His remedy is not to import **Catholic Marian devotion** or a cult of saints, but to recover the **Eucharistic memorial** of the dead and to cultivate **ecclesial remembrance** that honors family within the **body of Christ**. Another hallmark is the strategic elevation of **weekly Eucharist** in Pentecostal settings to anchor **charisms** within a catholic order. Finally, his insistence that doctrine inherits its primary content from **liturgy** prioritizes **theologia prima** in ways that challenge much contemporary evangelical method.

#### 7. Doctrinal development, pedagogy, and pastoral strategy
Chan’s constructive program envisions doctrinal development as **liturgical catechesis** under the **rule of faith**. In curricula and pastoral handbooks he writes as a teacher of **ascetical theology**, giving pastors patterns to form congregations into a **Eucharistic people**. He stresses **virtue formation** through disciplines, seeing the church’s calendar and daily offices as a school for **charity**, **hope**, and **faith**. His pedagogy is relentlessly ecclesial. The Bible is read as **Scripture in church**, preaching culminates in **Table communion**, and **pastoral counseling** is framed by confession, intercession, and deliverance shaped by **Christus Victor**. For urban Asia he presses economic and status critiques as spiritual disciplines, challenging **mammon** by tithing as **askesis**, and challenging ethnic chauvinism by the multiethnic **Eucharistic body**.

In this pastoral strategy, the dialectic of **participation and mission** is crucial. Chan resists consumer spirituality by habituating Christians to attend to **presence** before **program**. He argues that mission flows from **doxology**; the **church as sacrament** of the kingdom embodies a foretaste of reconciled life. This sacramental framing has ethical bite. He connects **sanctity of life**, **marital fidelity**, and **economic justice** to the Eucharist’s reconciling power. He expects **charisms** to serve public holiness, not private thrill, and he disciplines their use within the **ordo** for the edification of the **communion**.

#### 8. Reception, impact, and ongoing tasks
Chan’s writings gained traction across **Pentecostal**, **evangelical**, and **ecumenical** contexts because they spoke a double language: **catholic retrieval** and **Asian grassroots realism**. Courses in **spiritual theology** and **liturgy** across Asia and beyond regularly assign **Spiritual Theology** 1998 and **Liturgical Theology** 2006, while **Grassroots Asian Theology** 2014 has become a major point of reference in contextual studies wrestling with **ancestor veneration** and **folk religion**. His editorial leadership at the **Asian Journal of Theology** helped platform constructive conversations between **mission studies**, **systematic theology**, and **Asian church leaders**. Within Pentecostal scholarship, he is cited alongside **Amos Yong** and **Frank Macchia** as shaping a more ecclesial and sacramental turn. In pastoral realities, his advocacy for **weekly Eucharist**, for **deliverance in ordinary ministry**, and for **catechumenal processes** has influenced church reform in Singapore, Malaysia, and beyond.

The ongoing task, by Chan’s own lights, remains the patient rebuilding of **ecclesial cultures** in Asia resilient to consumerism, nationalistic ideology, and religious commodification. This requires continued **ressourcement**, attention to **grassroots concerns** about power and blessing, and a disciplined refusal of both syncretism and sectarianism. The viability of his project depends on sustained formation of pastors in **ascetical theology**, careful **liturgical renewal**, and a commitment to **the Spirit’s sanctifying presence** within the concrete, often messy lives of Asian congregations.

In Reformed and Westminster circles, Chan’s project offers significant gifts and real tensions. His emphasis on the **church as worshiping community**, the insistence that theology be ecclesial and doxological, and his critique of consumer spirituality resonate with a **means-of-grace** ecclesiology and a robust **Christus Victor** framed by the cross. His pastoral realism about **spiritual warfare** and his rejection of **prosperity theology** are instructive. Yet his strong reliance on **lex orandi, lex credendi** risks inverting **sola Scriptura** by letting liturgical tradition function as a near-normative source alongside Scripture. His **sacramental ontology** can blur the Reformed accent on the **Word’s primacy** and the **Regulative Principle of Worship**, and his retrieval of **theosis** leans toward **synergeia** in sanctification at points where classical Reformed theology stresses the **monergism of grace** in regeneration and the Spirit’s decisive initiative. His near-sacramental alignment of **Spirit baptism** with initiation may be read as compressing the Reformed distinction between **effectual calling**, **faith**, and the sanctifying work that follows under the **ordinary means**. Finally, his use of the **communion of saints** to address **ancestor veneration** is pastorally creative but requires vigilant catechesis lest remembrance shade into propitiatory practices. A Reformed alternative affirms Chan’s instinct that worship forms doctrine, yet would reassert the **Scripture-principle** as architectonic, order **Word and sacrament** under Christ’s kingship, frame spiritual warfare under the covenant Lordship of Christ’s finished work, and pursue contextualization through **catechesis, discipline, and ordinary means**, not through liturgical development as quasi-source of doctrine. In that register, Chan remains an invaluable conversation partner: a Pentecostal catholic whose retrievals sharpen Reformed commitments even as they invite critical engagement.
