### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and setting within analytic theology
Joshua R. Farris emerges as a contemporary voice in **philosophical theology** shaped by the post-Plantingan revival of **analytic philosophy of religion** and the institutional consolidation of **analytic theology** after 2000. His work is framed by the contest between **Christian physicalism** and **substance dualism** and by retrievals of **classical theism** in dialogue with **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Reformed scholasticism**. The animating pressure is twofold. First, developments in neuroscience and biblical studies emboldened **nonreductive physicalism** associated with figures like **Nancey Murphy** and **Joel B. Green**, which claim holistic biblical support and scientific consonance. Second, the analytic recovery of **metaphysical realism** by **Alvin Plantinga** and **Richard Swinburne** created space to reassess **soul-body** models with renewed rigor. Farris situates himself here with a conviction that dogmatics needs a thick ontology of persons for **imago Dei**, **incarnation**, **atonement**, **intermediate state**, and **resurrection**. He writes with patrons in **J. P. Moreland** and critics in **Lynne Rudder Baker** and **Peter van Inwagen**, yet he insists that analytic clarity serve **creedal catholicity** and **Reformed confessional** ends.

#### 2. Method: analytic metaphysics in service of dogma
Farris advances a method that marries **analytic metaphysics** with **dogmatic theology**, trusting that conceptual analysis can clarify **trinitarian**, **Christological**, and **anthropological** claims without collapsing their mystery. He assumes a realist metaphysic about properties, essences, and substances; hence persons are best construed as subsisting subjects that ground **first-person perspective**, intentionality, and moral responsibility, rather than emergent systems of **physical states**. Theologically, he treats Scripture as the norming norm and reads the tradition as a providentially guided interpreter of **creedal orthodoxy**. He retrieves **Latin theism** on **divine simplicity** and **aseity** while carefully leveraging **Greek theosis** through **union with Christ**. Within this frame, Farris uses modal and mereological tools to test rival theses like **Thomistic hylomorphism**, **animalism**, and **constitution views**, judging them by doctrinal payoffs for **imago Dei**, **original sin**, and **resurrection identity**. The method is unapologetically constructive: philosophical theorizing is not a replacement for exegesis but a means to exhibit what **classical dogma** already implicitly entails about **human persons**.

#### 3. The Soul of Theological Anthropology 2017: a Cartesian exploration
In **The Soul of Theological Anthropology: A Cartesian Exploration** 2017, Farris contends for **Cartesian substance dualism** as the model that best integrates Christian dogma with a robust philosophy of mind. The book presents a cumulative case. Modal arguments for the separability of mind and body show that I, a thinking subject, can exist without my organism, which secures the possibility of **disembodied survival** in the **intermediate state**. Phenomenological arguments about the **first-person perspective** support the irreducibility of persons to physical systems. Moral agency and culpability require a stable locus of identity across change, which a **simple soul** supplies more naturally than complexly changing organisms. Farris then turns to theological pressure points. The **imago Dei** is located in rational soul capacities oriented to **God** and perfected in **theosis** as participatory union, not by assimilation of essence but by grace. **Original sin** and **federal headship** remain explicable because souls are genuine subjects under covenantal structures, while bodily inheritance patterns alone cannot secure the needed moral status. He argues that **hylomorphism** either collapses into functional physicalism or fails to explain disembodied existence, and that **constitution views** lack the ontological resources to underwrite the same-experiencer across death and resurrection.

#### 4. Christian Physicalism? 2018: a sustained critique
The edited volume **Christian Physicalism? Philosophical-Theological Criticisms** 2018, co-edited with **Keith Loftin**, gathers arguments that scrutinize **physicalist** accounts from multiple angles. Farris contributes and curates essays that probe whether **incarnation** can be reconciled with an exclusively physical Jesus, how **resurrection identity** can be maintained without a persisting subject, and whether Scripture actually endorses monism once lexical and narrative evidence for the **intermediate state** and **heavenly worship** are weighed. Engagements with **Peter van Inwagen**, **Trenton Merricks**, **Kevin Corcoran**, and **Lynne Rudder Baker** interrogate duplication puzzles, the metaphysics of fission, and the adequacy of **psychological continuity** without a soul-subject. Farris presses a doctrinal reductio: if **Christian physicalism** cannot ground post-mortem agency prior to the general resurrection, then core practices like **prayer for the departed** in the wider tradition and expectations of **presence with Christ** in **Philippians 1** and **2 Corinthians 5** become unintelligible. The volume is characteristic of his style: analytic rigor, historical sensitivity to **creedal Christology**, and pastoral concern for the hope of **beatific communion**.

#### 5. Introduction to Theological Anthropology 2020: humans both creaturely and divine
With **An Introduction to Theological Anthropology: Humans, Both Creaturely and Divine?** 2020, Farris provides a map of the field that centers the **imago Dei** within a teleology of **participation**. The headline phrase both creaturely and divine is polemical and pedagogical. It signals a robust **deification** thesis that remains within the **Creator-creature distinction**, aligning with **Athanasius** and **Calvin** on **union with Christ**. The book surveys **gender and sex**, **race and ethnicity**, **freedom and sin**, and **death and resurrection**, repeatedly showing how a **soul-body** framework stabilizes doctrine. On **imago Dei**, Farris integrates structural, functional, and relational accounts by positing the soul as the primary seat of Godward capacities elevated by grace. On **original sin**, he argues for the compatibility of **federal imputation** with soul-based personhood. On embodiment, he insists that bodies are essential for human flourishing even if not metaphysically necessary for personal persistence, which permits a robust **intermediate state** while honoring a **creational eschatology** of bodily resurrection. The text models a retrieval posture, drawing from **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck**, while disputing claims by **nonreductive physicalists** that monism is the only biblically faithful option.

#### 6. The Creation of Self 2023: a case for creationism about the soul
In **The Creation of Self: A Case for the Soul** 2023, Farris develops **creationism about the soul**, the thesis that God directly creates each human soul. The view is argued from metaphysical, theological, and moral considerations. Metaphysically, the simplicity and immateriality of the soul make it an unsuitable candidate for generation by biological processes or parental efficient causation. Theologically, **imago Dei** as a Godward, rational, and moral capacity is best grounded in a created immaterial subject that bears divine gifts immediately from God. Morally, creationism secures the dignity and value of nascent human persons and clarifies personal identity from conception to death. Farris answers **traducianism** by conceding its explanatory power for solidarity yet maintaining that **federal headship in Adam** and **union with Christ** in redemption are covenantal, not primarily biological. He critiques **emergentism** for reintroducing dualism through the back door while failing to deliver an ontological subject that can traverse death. The book also engages puzzles about **brain death**, **split-brain cases**, and **persistent vegetative states**, showing how a soul-subject grounds continuity of the self despite radical bodily change, while affirming that embodiment is ordered to human completion in **resurrection glory**.

#### 7. Christology, incarnation, and resurrection identity
Farris extends his **anthropology** into **Christology** by defending a cautious **two-minds Christology** that distinguishes the human psychological life of Jesus from the eternal **Logos** while maintaining a single person, consistent with **Chalcedon** and the enhypostatic account of the human nature. He draws upon **Oliver Crisp** to claim that a dual-consciousness model secures genuine human experience without compromising **communicatio idiomatum** or **inseparable operations**. A dualist anthropology aids this Christology by allowing a human soul in Christ that is united to the divine person of the Son, preserving the reality of **homo assumptus** without Nestorian division. On **resurrection**, Farris argues that personal identity is grounded in the persisting soul that is reunited with a transformed body, a thesis that avoids both the duplication anxieties of **reassembly** models and the loss of agency in **soul sleep**. This metaphysical account underwrites hope for **beatific vision** as the consummation of **theosis**, where the soul sees God in the face of Christ and is conformed to him by the Spirit. He insists that the metaphysics here is ministerial to dogma, clarifying what the church confesses about **incarnation** and **life everlasting**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and the constrained field of options
Across these projects, Farris consistently contends with **nonreductive physicalism** and **constitution views** while negotiating with **Thomistic hylomorphism** as a serious competitor. With **Lynne Rudder Baker**, he grants the centrality of the **first-person perspective** but denies that it can be realized without a substantial soul. With **Peter van Inwagen** and **Trenton Merricks**, he rejects materialist accounts of identity that sever the unity of agency across radical change. He appreciates **Aquinas** on **form and matter**, yet argues that a soul that never actually exists without matter would not easily reconcile with the churchs confidence in an **intermediate state** between death and resurrection. He receives help from **Augustine** on introspection and from **Swinburne** and **Moreland** on modal and causal arguments for dualism. He reads **Calvin** on **union with Christ** to discipline talk of **theosis**, and he sees **Bavinck** as a guide to hold together **creation**, **grace**, and **eschatology**. The field of options is constrained, on his telling, by creedal commitments to **incarnation**, **resurrection**, and **beatific vision**, which exert pressure favoring **substance dualism** over monist or near-monist proposals.

#### 9. Doctrinal payoff: imago, sin, salvation, and hope
The doctrinal payoff of Farris s project can be summarized in four knots. First, the **imago Dei** finds an ontological seat in the **soul** as the subject of rational, moral, and relational capacities ordered to God, which opens onto **theosis** understood as *participatio* by grace. Second, **original sin** and **guilt** can be articulated in covenantal terms alongside personal subjectivity, preserving both **federal headship** and personal accountability. Third, **salvation** as **union with Christ** is teleologically ordered to the transformation of the person in knowledge and love, which presupposes a persisting subject that can be sanctified through time and consummated in **glorification**. Fourth, **eschatology** requires a metaphysic of **intermediate state** and **resurrection identity** where the same person who dies stands before God and is raised, a thesis that a **simple soul** grounds without recourse to speculative divine memory or recomposition. Throughout, Farris binds these threads by insisting that analytic clarity is not an intruder but a handmaid to **creedal confession** and pastoral proclamation of **resurrection hope**.

#### 10. Reformed and Westminster evaluation: affirmation and cautions
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Farris offers salutary retrievals and pressing questions. His defense of **substance dualism** aligns with **Reformed orthodoxy** on the **intermediate state**, gives ontological heft to the **imago Dei**, and supports **resurrection identity** with a persisting subject. His retrieval of **union with Christ** and a guarded **theosis** resonates with **Calvin** and **Bavinck** when framed by the **Creator-creature distinction** and **divine simplicity**. Yet cautions arise. A strongly **Cartesian** model risks diminishing the creational goodness and covenantal primacy of embodiment, where **covenant anthropology** emphasizes the integrated psychosomatic unity of the person. His **creationism about the soul** can strain accounts of **original sin** and solidarity that many within the tradition have explained by **traducianism**, even if **federal imputation** can shoulder the doctrinal load. His sympathetic use of **two-minds Christology** invites scrutiny in light of **anhypostatic-enhypostatic** grammar and the **communicatio idiomatum**, lest psychological partition suggest a Nestorian drift. Methodologically, the weight given to **analytic metaphysical intuitions** must remain ministerial to **redemptive-historical revelation**, lest Scripture be disciplined by a priori constraints. A constructive Reformed alternative would commend a **hylomorphic dualism** that secures **intermediate state** and **resurrection identity** while accenting the body-soul unity of covenantal life, would restrict **theosis** talk to **union with Christ** by the Spirit within the **Creator-creature** boundary, and would anchor anthropology more explicitly in **covenant** and **federal headship**, thereby harnessing Farris s metaphysical gains within a more holistically biblical frame.
