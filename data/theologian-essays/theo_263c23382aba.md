### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Kevin Chiarot is a contemporary **Reformed** pastor-theologian whose scholarly profile emerged within the ongoing reassessment of **Barthian** and **T. F. Torrance** trajectories in Anglophone theology. Writing from the stable center of the **Westminster Standards** and the apparatus of **Reformed scholasticism**, he positions himself as an interpreter who listens hard to **patristic Christology** while testing modern proposals by Scripture’s **principium divinum** and the **analogia fidei**. The intellectual context of his work is the late-modern return to **ressourcement**, where Protestants reread **Athanasius**, **Gregory Nazianzen**, and **Cyril of Alexandria** to renew dogmatics. Unlike purely historical retrieval, however, Chiarot’s method is doctrinally normative, employing the precise tools of **hypostatic union**, **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, and **communicatio idiomatum** to evaluate claims about the **humanity of Christ** that surface in **Torrance’s scientific theology** and its **Barthian** roots.

The pastoral orientation of Chiarot’s vocation is not incidental. His approach insists that the register of doctrine must serve **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **piety**, and so he measures proposals by their power to secure **assurance**, **justification**, and **sanctification**. That ecclesial proximity sharpens his resistance to speculative drift in modern **incarnational realism**. It also explains why categories like **duplex gratia**, **federal headship**, and the **covenant of works** appear as architectonic controls in his analysis. Methodologically, he strives for careful textual exegesis of loci classici such as **Romans 8:3** and **Hebrews 4:15**, rigorous historical reading of patristic sources, and dogmatic synthesis framed by **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the **extra Calvinisticum**.

#### 2. The central project: assessing Torrance on the humanity of Christ
Chiarot’s signature contribution comes in his monograph, **The Unassumed Is the Unhealed: The Humanity of Christ in the Theology of T. F. Torrance** published in 2013. The title invokes the Nazianzen maxim, what is not assumed is not healed, and probes whether **T. F. Torrance** rightly applies that patristic rule to argue that the **incarnate Son** assumed a fallen human nature in order to redeem it from the inside. The book’s central claim is twofold. First, Torrance’s reading of **Gregory Nazianzen** and **Cyril of Alexandria** overextends the patristic axiom by converting it into an ontology of fallen flesh inhabiting the Logos. Second, that extension destabilizes **impeccability**, unsettles the **forensic center of the atonement**, and risks displacing **penal substitution** with **vicarious repentance** and an ontologized participation.

Chiarot shows how Torrance develops a chain of concepts that includes **incarnational union**, **ontological healing**, and the **vicarious humanity of Christ**, by which Christ supposedly repents, believes, and offers obedience in our stead within a shared fallen condition. The Reformed worry, which Chiarot articulates with precision, is that this theological grammar tends to relocate soteriological causality from the cross’s **penal satisfaction** and **imputation** to a continuous incarnational process. For Chiarot, that move threatens the **instrumentality of faith**, the **duplex gratia** structure of **justification and sanctification**, and the **federal** texture of **covenant** that binds Adam, Christ, and believers within Scripture’s narrative.

#### 3. Patristic retrieval and the contested meaning of the Nazianzen maxim
A major section of Chiarot’s argument carefully situates **Gregory Nazianzen’s** maxim within fourth-century **pro-Nicene** debates over the **homoousios** and the identity of the agent who assumes. His reading holds that Gregory’s what is not assumed is not healed is fundamentally a christological safeguard for the **unity of person** and the **fullness of human nature** in the **hypostatic union**, not a charter for positing the Son’s possession of **fallen concupiscence**. Turning to **Cyril of Alexandria**, Chiarot traces the stress on the one **prosopon** and the communicative union of natures that grounds salvation, again without implying that the **Logos** took sin’s privation or disordered inclination into his humanity.

Against **Torrance’s** patristic appeals, Chiarot retrieves **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** as a central patristic and Reformed tool: the human nature of Christ is without a distinct human hypostasis, subsisting in the person of the Son, and thus is the concrete site of salvation as the humanity of the **Logos**. This established pattern allows one to affirm the breadth of Christ’s **assumption** without converting assumption into **fallenness**. The Reformed christological lines thereby protect **impeccability** and resist any dissolution of the **extra Calvinisticum**, maintaining the truth that the Son is never confined to the flesh even as the whole Christ acts for us in and through his true humanity.

#### 4. Exegesis and dogmatics: Romans 8:3 and Hebrews 4:15
Exegesis anchors Chiarot’s dogmatics. His discussion of **Romans 8:3** turns on the Pauline phrase in the likeness of sinful flesh. He argues, in line with **Reformed orthodoxy**, that likeness marks a boundary: Christ assumes the full reality of our flesh under the conditions of mortality and curse but not the moral disorderedness of **concupiscence** or any privation of original righteousness. The Son is sent in the likeness of sinful flesh to condemn sin in the flesh, not to embody sin’s inner deformation. When **Torrance** collapses likeness into identity, Chiarot contends, he blurs the **sinlessness** of Christ and obscures the judicial logic of condemnation. In **Hebrews 4:15**, tempted yet without sin, Chiarot finds confirmation that the **impeccability** of the mediator is not a metaphysical distance but a moral perfection, sustained by the Spirit and intrinsic to the integrity of the **hypostatic union**.

From these texts, Chiarot unfolds a careful dogmatic argument about Christ’s susceptibility to suffering, weariness, and death as assumed conditions of our **fallen world** rather than internal sinfulness of his **human nature**. He utilizes **Reformed scholastic** distinctions to differentiate penal conditions borne by the mediator as our **surety** from moral corruption, and he upholds a strong doctrine of the **Spirit’s anointing** of the human nature as the mode by which Jesus, the second Adam, obeys and triumphs without any internal concupiscence. The line from **federal headship** through **active obedience** to **imputation** is thus preserved.

#### 5. Atonement: vicarious humanity and penal substitution in tension
Central to Chiarot’s critique is **Torrance’s** construction of the **vicarious humanity of Christ**, the idea that within the incarnation itself Christ offers the faith, repentance, and obedience we cannot. Chiarot grants the value of underscoring Christ’s representative obedience but resists the outcome when it is cast as an ontological interiorization of our fallen condition. He contends that such a model displaces the primacy of **penal substitution**, where the curse of the **law** is borne and satisfied by the mediator at the cross. For Chiarot, the order of salvation requires the legal ground of **imputation** secured in the **covenant of works** fulfilled by Christ, out of which **union with Christ** and **sanctification** flow as the Spirit applies salvation by **faith alone**.

This Reformed center guards the **duplex gratia** architecture that binds **justification** and **sanctification** in proper relation, while also preventing the conflation of ontological participation with forensic standing. Chiarot is alert to the drift in **incarnational realism** that tends to treat justification as an effect of Christ’s healed humanity shared with us. His rejoinder insists that the **covenantal** and **forensic** registers of Scripture do not compete with **participation** but govern it, so that believers truly participate in the risen Christ by the Spirit on the settled basis of an alien righteousness reckoned to them.

#### 6. Trinity, divine attributes, and the extra Calvinisticum
Though his book’s focus is christological, Chiarot’s analysis touches the **doctrine of God**. He worries that collapsing the distinction between **likeness** and **identity** in Christ’s assumption risks pressures against **divine impassibility** and **immutability** when modern accounts strain the **communicatio idiomatum** beyond its classical bounds. By reinforcing the **extra Calvinisticum**, he preserves the conviction that the eternal Son fully possesses the divine life beyond and in the assumed human nature. This dogmatic guardrail prevents the leakage of fallen properties into the divine nature and fends off a misdirected **theopaschitism** that would ascribe disordered passions to God. The **Trinitarian** shape of salvation thus remains secure: the Father sends the Son, the Son assumes our nature and fulfills all righteousness, and the Spirit perfects and applies this work in the economy without any compromise of **divine simplicity**.

Analogously, Chiarot maintains that the **asymmetry** of the **communication of idioms** is non-negotiable. Predication concerning the person is two-sided, yet the natures retain their properties. To introduce fallenness into the human nature assumed by the Son would distort the logic by which the passions and sufferings are truly those of the person according to the human nature, while the divine nature remains impassible. This classical grammar secures both the full humanity of Jesus in its susceptibility to suffering and the unblemished **holiness** needed for a perfect **sacrifice**.

#### 7. Ecclesial and sacramental implications
Chiarot recognizes that **Torrance’s** incarnational emphasis bears ecclesial and sacramental implications. Torrance’s **incarnational realism** tends to magnify the church’s sacramental mediation as an extension of Christ’s vicarious humanity. Chiarot does not deny a robust **sacramental** theology but reframes it within **Word and sacrament** where the **Spirit** is the agent applying Christ’s once-for-all achievement. Here the classic **Reformed** accents return: the efficacy of the sacraments is not ex opere operato but lies in the Spirit’s use of the signs to strengthen **faith**, which receives the benefits grounded in **imputation** and the **covenant** promises. By refusing to ontologize ecclesial participation, he keeps the center on the completed work of the **Mediator** rather than on an ongoing incarnational process embedded in the church.

This ecclesial reframing reflects how Chiarot’s project is not a narrow christological correction but a systemic repair that reorders **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramental theology** under the banner of **federal** and **forensic** categories. The church’s life, in this vision, displays the fruits of a finished redemption applied by the Spirit, rather than constituting the site where redemption in its essence continues to occur.

#### 8. Dialogue partners: Barthian streams and Reformed orthodoxy
Chiarot’s critical engagements range across the **Barth** reception. He recognizes how **McCormack** and **Hunsinger** interpret **Barth’s** and **Torrance’s** christological innovations and welcomes their renewed focus on the **mediator**. Yet, he judges that Barthian ontological soteriology, when received through **Torrance**, threatens the covenantal and legal grammar recovered by **Calvin**, **Owen**, **Turretin**, and consolidated in **Bavinck**. His retrieval strategy resurrects the tested Reformed schema of **federal headship**, **active and passive obedience**, and the ordered relation of **union with Christ** to **imputation**, showing how the tradition’s distinctions are not scholastic detritus but pastoral safeguards for **assurance** and **holiness**.

Patristically, he reads **Gregory Nazianzen** and **Cyril** with sympathy, yet insists that their maxim and their christological outcomes align with **impeccability**, the purity of Christ’s **human nature**, and the instrumental role of the **Spirit**. In this light the **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** nexus, far from being an arid technicality, is the key to articulating how the **Person** of the Son is the subject of all saving acts without making sinfulness the condition of his solidarity with sinners. This is a deeply Reformed patristic retrieval that resists placing modern pressure on the union to carry a moral fallenness into the **Mediator**.

#### 9. Contributions and limits
The constructive yield of Chiarot’s work includes a renewed clarity on **Romans 8:3**, a rigorous defense of **impeccability**, and a coherent account of how Christ bears the penal conditions of our **fallen world** as **surety** without internal **concupiscence**. He helps a new generation of Reformed readers discern where **incarnational realism** rightly stresses solidarity and where it wrongly conflates solidarity with fallenness. His insistence on the priority of **penal substitution** and **imputation** does not reject **participation** but resituates it under the biblical **covenant**. This realignment yields a salutary reassertion of the **duplex gratia** structure, stabilizing the relation of **justification** and **sanctification** and guarding the **instrumentality of faith**.

At the same time, the limits of his project are the limits of a focused polemic. Because the book concentrates on **Torrance’s** christology, less space is devoted to exploring positive accounts of **theosis** compatible with **Reformed** dogmatics or to articulating a more catholic ontology of participation. Yet, even here, the gesture is clear: one may affirm participation robustly so long as **forensic** foundations are kept central. Chiarot’s tools provide a pathway for further constructive work on **union with Christ**, enriched rather than eclipsed by **covenant** and **federal** motifs.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Chiarot’s project is a careful exercise in confessional theology. It affirms a **Scripture-principled** method, prizes **classical theism**, and defends the **forensic** heart of the gospel. His critique of **Torrance** identifies a genuine doctrinal tension: whether salvation is grounded principally in a **covenantal** and **penal** act or in an **incarnational** process of ontological healing. Chiarot adjudicates that tension in favor of **federal representation**, **imputation**, and the **covenant of works** fulfilled by the **second Adam**. In Westminster terms, his analysis coheres with **Van Til’s** insistence on the **Creator–creature distinction**, the **antithesis**, and a revelational **epistemology** where theological method is normed by Scripture, not speculative metaphysics. The alternative he proposes is straightforward: maintain the breadth of Christ’s **solidarity** without attributing **fallenness** to his humanity, secure **penal substitution** as the atoning center, and order **union with Christ** and **participation** as Spirit-wrought benefits arising from a completed, forensic accomplishment. By these principles, the strengths of **patristic retrieval** are received, while the pressures of **Barthian–Torrance** incarnationalism on **justification by faith alone** are resisted in the interest of evangelical clarity.
