### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Born in 1943 and dying in 2017, **Marilyn McCord Adams** moved at the intersection of **analytic philosophy of religion** and **Anglican systematic theology**, while also becoming a premier interpreter of **late medieval scholasticism**, especially **William Ockham**. Her long teaching career included UCLA and UNC Chapel Hill, and in 2004 she became **Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford**, simultaneously Canon of Christ Church, bringing an ordained **Episcopal** priestly sensibility to a university chair shaped by **Augustinian** and **patristic** legacies. This institutional setting amplified a method that married high-level **analytic metaphysics** to **sacramental Anglican** theology, with pastoral attention to the kinds of **horrendous evils** that scar late modern memory: genocide, torture, child abuse. The signature claim that only **Christic theosis** can personally defeat such horrors emerges from this triangulation of analytic rigor, medieval retrieval, and ecclesial vocation.

Adams self-consciously positions her work against standard **theodicies** in the analytic tradition, from **Plantinga’s free-will defense** to **Hick’s soul-making**. She deems these too thin to reckon with what she calls **engulfing disvalue**. Her method is **Christocentric and participatory**. Rather than seeking a global explanation that balances evils against generic goods, she argues for **personal defeat** of horrors through a narrative re-interpretation of one’s life in **union with the incarnate Word**, climaxing in the **beatific vision**. The operative categories are **defeat** rather than mere **justification**, **participation** rather than merely **permission**, and **sacramental mediation** rather than purely **providential calculus**.

A decisive historical resource for Adams is **medieval Christology and sacramentology**. She mines **Anselm’s Cur Deus Homo**, the metaphysics of **Chalcedon’s hypostatic union**, the **communicatio idiomatum** tradition, and the debates over **Eucharistic presence** among **Aquinas**, **Giles of Rome**, **Duns Scotus**, and **Ockham**. These sources enable her to frame a coherent account in which **Incarnation**, **atonement**, and **Eucharist** are not detachable loci but a single mystery of **divine identification** with the depths of human **horror**.

#### 2. Horrendous evils and the shape of the question
The pivotal concept of **horrendous evils** appears programmatically in her book **Horrendous Evils and the Goodness of God** 1999 and earlier essays. Horrendous evils are those that, by their very nature, threaten to make the victim’s life not worth living because they annihilate the possibility of positive self-valuation and God-ward trust. Adams’ diagnosis is existential and theological: such **engulfing disvalue** cannot be offset by aggregative goods at the level of the cosmos. The very grammar of **goodness** must be shifted from tallying to **defeat**. A horror is defeated only if absorbed into a personal relationship with God that confers a greater, identity-defining good on the very subject who suffered it.

In this register, **Plantinga’s** permission of evil to secure **significant freedom**, and **Hick’s** appeal to **soul-making**, fall short because they are impersonal and distributive. Adams contends that God’s perfect goodness implies an obligation of **horror-sample compensation** to each sufferer, not a general justification of the system. The semantics of **defeat** is therefore personal, teleological, and eschatological. Only **participatory theosis** through Christ can plausibly offer such defeat, because only the infinite good of **God’s own life** can saturate and transform the narrative space horrors occupy. The implication is that **Incarnation** is soteriologically basic, a divine movement of **identification** to rescue lives that otherwise would be moral failures.

The constructive punch is the robust linkage of **theosis** with **Beatific Vision** in a Western idiom. Adams leans on Latin accounts of **visio Dei** while borrowing the Eastern idiom of **deification**. The integrative thesis is that God can make a human life a great good by giving that person a role in Christ’s story, concretized through **baptism**, **Eucharist**, and the **Spirit’s** transforming presence. The **crux** is that such grace does not erase horrors as if they never occurred; rather, divine love re-narrates them within the space of **communion**, rendering them occasions of deeper participation in the **paschal mystery**.

#### 3. Christ and Horrors: Christology in analytic key
In **Christ and Horrors: The Coherence of Christology** 2006, Adams turns from the soteriological problem to the metaphysical structure capable of bearing it. She defends a classical **Chalcedonian** Christology using analytic tools like **qua-operators** for predication: Christ qua God is omniscient, Christ qua human is limited. This formalism underwrites the **communicatio idiomatum** without collapsing natures. Against **kenotic** models that infer a divestment of divine attributes, she insists on the integrity of the **divine nature**, while positing an existential descent into human **horrors** through the assumed **human nature**.

Adams pushes beyond bare coherence to argue that the **Incarnation** is purposively ordered to confront and defeat **horrendous evils**. The decisive soteriological content is **divine identification**: God the Son assumes not a generic humanity but a position within the human condition’s extremities, including rejection, torture, and death. Through this, Christ achieves not only **forgiveness** but also **personal horror-defeat** for those united to him. She reworks **atonement** away from a solely **penal-substitutionary** ledger and toward an ontology of **union with Christ**, sacramentally mediated, where **satisfaction** and **victory** motifs are subsumed under **participation**.

The theological pay-off is twofold. First, **coherence**: Adams resists the claim that classical **two-natures** Christology is metaphysically incoherent, using tools common in **analytic philosophy of mind and modality**. Second, **theodicy**: only a Christ capable of mediating **theosis** can do the soteriological work her account requires. The result is a distinctively **Anglican** pattern in which **Incarnation**, **Paschal Mystery**, and **sacramental communion** form the skeleton of a **participatory theodicy**.

#### 4. Medieval interlocutors and sacramental ontology
Adams’ medieval scholarship is most apparent in her multi-volume work on **William Ockham** and in **Some Later Medieval Theories of the Eucharist** 2010. On **Ockham**, she details the complex relationships among **divine power** absolute and ordained, **voluntarist ethics**, and **nominalist metaphysics**. While deeply appreciative of Ockham’s rigor, she expresses concern where extreme **voluntarism** seems to destabilize moral confidence in **divine goodness**. This critical sympathy conditions her insistence that God’s goodness be recognizable in the personal defeat of **horrors**, not merely in inscrutable decrees.

Her treatment of **Eucharistic presence** canvasses **Aquinas’ transubstantiation**, **Giles’** refinements, **Scotus’** formalities, and **Ockham’s** account of accidents without subject. The constructive conclusion is a catholic **sacramental realism** in which Christ’s **real presence** is not an add-on but a crucial mode of **divine identification** with the Church. The Eucharist thus becomes a privileged medium by which victims of **horrendous evils** are joined to Christ’s **self-offering**, granting share in his risen identity and so advancing the **defeat** of horrors in their lives.

This sacramental accent integrates her analytic **Christology** with ecclesial practice. For Adams, **soteriology** is not only a metaphysical relation but an ongoing **liturgical** participation. The **Book of Common Prayer** provides the spiritual grammar in which **confession**, **absolution**, and **communion** enact the **paschal** pattern. The pastoral claim is bold: God has equipped the Church with means adequate to re-narrate even extremities of **evil** through **Christic participation**.

#### 5. Original sin, hell, and the scope of salvation
Adams reframes **original sin** under the rubric of structural **horror-participation** rather than the mere transmission of guilt. Human beings are born into networks of damage that predispose them to both suffer and perpetrate **horrendous evils**. The diagnosis heightens the need for a soteriology of **radical healing** rather than minimal acquittal. In this context she develops a wrestling relation to **hell**. God’s goodness, on her view, entails a commitment to offering every person the personal **defeat** of horrors through **union with Christ**. This generates pressure toward a strong **universalist** hope, or at least a view on which the set of those finally unreconciled is empty or vanishingly small.

Adams’ reasoning here is explicit: if God allows horrors to occur, then divine goodness requires God not only to bring greater goods into the world but to make those goods redound to the good of each sufferer. Because some horrors are such that only infinite intimacy with God can outweigh them, God must make such intimacy effectively available to all. The metaphysics of **grace** and the eschatology of **beatific vision** converge in a tendency toward **universal reconciliation**. This does not trivialize moral freedom, but it construes **freedom** teleologically, where the fully known goodness of God makes permanent refusal irrational and ultimately self-defeating.

This scope also refigures **the atonement**. Adams does not deny **substitution** or **satisfaction**, yet she resists any depiction where God’s justice is satisfied apart from the victim’s **personal defeat** of horror. The **cross** is not a transaction behind the scenes but the site where God in Christ shoulders **horror** to the bottom, so that, in **union**, the believer’s particular sufferings are drawn into the resurrected life. The **beatific vision** then seals the narrative re-interpretation, fixing identity in **gloria** rather than **trauma**.

#### 6. Philosophical clarifications: goodness, defeat, and divine responsibility
A noteworthy strength of Adams’ project is the distinction she draws within **divine goodness** between creating a good world and being good to each created person. She argues that **perfect goodness** obligates God to secure a life worth living for every creature capable of horror. The metric of evaluation is thus not macro-optimizing the total universe but **interpersonal fidelity**. This anchors **defeat** as normative: God must absorb horrors into a relationship that revalues them without condoning or trivializing evil.

Alongside this, Adams considers **divine responsibility**. Without imputing moral failure to God, she resists evasive appeals to inscrutable sovereignty. On her view, creating a world with the possibility of **horrendous evils** incurs a divine commitment to repair at the level of persons. This is not **Pelagian** bargaining but a result of **divine charity**, which cannot leave creatures stranded in horror’s ruins. Thus the emphasis on **Incarnation** and **sacrament** is not devotional ornament; it is the metaphysical mechanism by which God takes ownership of the consequences of allowing **horror** and transforms them by **self-gift**.

Her careful semantics of **defeat** protects against two extremes. Against **optimistic theodicies**, she denies that global goods license particular harms. Against **skeptical theism**, she refuses a posture that would make divine goodness opaque in principle. By rooting evaluation in **Christic participation**, she claims an epistemic access point: the **crucified and risen** Lord is the sign and instrument of God’s personal rectification of horrors.

#### 7. Ecclesial and pastoral implications
Because Adams is an **Anglican priest** as well as a philosopher, she threads her metaphysics through concrete **pastoral practice**. The Church’s ministry of **reconciliation**, the **anointing of the sick**, and the **Eucharist** are framed as divine strategies for **defeating** horrors in situ. She is frank about the limits of human care, but she refuses any separation between **doctrine** and **cure of souls**. The end is not merely coping but **theosis**. Survivors of abuse, war, and systemic injustice receive, in ecclesial life, foretastes of the **beatific intimacy** that will finally overwhelm horror’s engulfing disvalue.

In this light, **liturgy** becomes the theater of God’s **identification** with sufferers. The **Eucharist** especially figures as the locus of **real presence** where Christ offers himself as nourishment that integrates disintegrated selves. Adams’ medieval work on **Eucharistic metaphysics** furnishes the intellectual permission for such pastoral claims, while her analytic **Christology** guards against sentimental collapse into mere symbol. The unity of **sacrament** and **metaphysics** serves a single soteriological aim: nothing short of **union with the Triune God** can render a horror-ridden life a great good.

#### 8. Legacy and influence
Adams’ synthesis has reshaped discussions in **analytic theology** and **philosophy of religion**, shifting theodicy from global justification to **personal defeat**. Her categories of **horrendous evils**, **engulfing disvalue**, and **divine identification** have become staples in contemporary debates. She stands alongside figures like **Eleonore Stump** in making **narrative** and **relational** goods central, yet her insistence on **theosis** and **sacrament** marks a distinctively **Anglican catholic** contribution. In medieval studies, her work on **Ockham** and **Eucharistic presence** remains a standard reference, linking **scholastic** technicalities to live doctrinal questions.

Her constructive agenda has also prompted critical engagement. Proponents of **penal substitution** query whether **participation** suffices to ground objective rectification of guilt. Defenders of **eternal conscious punishment** dispute her trajectory toward **universalism**. Meanwhile, some analytic philosophers contest her claim that divine goodness imposes a duty of **personal defeat** to each sufferer. Yet even critics acknowledge the moral intuition her work crystallizes: if God is **supremely good**, a manner of **defeat** commensurate with horror’s depth must be found in **Christ**.

Final evaluation from a **Reformed/WTS** standpoint requires both affirmation and caution. Adams’ intense **Christocentrism**, her prioritizing of **union with Christ**, and her focus on **beatific vision** cohere with **Reformed** emphases on **communion** and **glory**. However, tensions arise at key loci. On **revelation and authority**, the weighting of **sacramental practice** and **medieval metaphysics** risks eclipsing **Scripture’s** covenantal frame. On **atonement**, the downgrading of **penal substitution** in favor of **participatory theosis** blunts biblical patterns of **federal headship** and **satisfaction**. On **soteriology**, the near-**universalist** pressure collides with **particular redemption** and the solemnity of **final judgment**. On **doctrine of God**, strong claims of **divine identification** must be squared with classical **impassibility** and **simplicity**, lest the **Incarnation** imply change in God *ad intra*. A Reformed alternative would retain Adams’ demand for **personal defeat** of horrors but secure it through **union with Christ** grounded in a once-for-all **penal-substitutionary atonement**, distributed by the **Spirit** through the **Word and sacraments** as covenant means, and eschatologically completed without committing to **universal salvation**. In short, Reformed theology can appropriate Adams’ pastoral insight into **horrendous evils** while re-anchoring it in **covenantal** exegesis, **impassible** divine love, and **particularist** redemption.
