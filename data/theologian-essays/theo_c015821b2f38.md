### ESSAY
Marcus Peter Johnson has emerged as a careful contemporary voice within broad evangelicalism whose constructive center is the claim that the gospel is the **incarnation of the Son** and the believers **union with Christ** through the Spirit. Teaching in a context shaped by the free-church and parachurch legacy of **Moody Bible Institute**, he writes against the background of evangelical fragmentation, programmatic pragmatism, and attenuated ecclesial identity. His project belongs to the larger post-1970s movement of **Reformation retrieval** and patristic ressourcement, yet it is distinctly pastoral, framed by the conviction that salvation is not a package of benefits but participation in the **person of Christ**. The atmosphere of post-2000 North American evangelical theology, marked by debates over **justification**, **sanctification**, and the shape of **sacramental practice**, provides the foil for his restatement of **unio cum Christo** as the integrating soteriological and ecclesiological principle.

Johnson’s method is unapologetically dogmatic and integrative, holding together **biblical exegesis** and **classical doctrine** under the primacy of Scripture, while refusing to sever soteriology from **Christology**. He retrieves **Athanasius’s** logic of salvation as participation in the divine life through the incarnate Son, signaled by the famous *theopoiēsis* motif, while preserving **Calvin’s** Creator-creature distinction through the **extra Calvinisticum**, the insistence that the eternal Son is not exhausted by his human nature. This method positions **union with Christ** as the structural center from which the loci of **justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **perseverance** derive their coherence, a move resonant with **John Murray** and **Richard Gaffin** who locate the ordo salutis within the historia salutis of the crucified and risen Lord. The result is a theology that is evangelical in tone, Reformed in grammar, and catholic in scope.

The programmatic statement appears in **One with Christ: An Evangelical Theology of Salvation** 2013, where Johnson argues that salvation is identical with **communion with the incarnate Mediator**, not simply the reception of discrete gifts. He frames **justification** as a benefit that is in Christ, not alongside him, so that **imputation** is soteriologically attached to **union**, a Spirit-wrought relation in which believers share the crucified and risen righteousness of the Lord. He advances the **duplex gratia**, Calvin’s double grace of justification and sanctification, by situating it within the wider participation that also yields **adoption**, **illumination**, and **glorification**. On Johnson’s account, faith is the Spirit’s instrument, not a meritorious cause, and thus **sola fide** secures the saving bond with the person of Christ. His refrain is that evangelicalism must recover the evangelical realism of being in Christ, a realism that resists purely forensic reduction or purely moral transformationism by grounding both in **Spirit-united participation**.

A crucial implication of this participatory center is Johnson’s treatment of the **church** and **sacraments**, which he regards as the Christ-appointed means through which the Spirit nurtures union and communion. Eschewing a **Zwinglian memorialism**, he aligns with **Calvin’s spiritual real presence** in the Supper, arguing that believers truly partake of Christ by the Spirit through faith. **Baptism**, for Johnson, is no bare sign but a divinely given means of incorporation into Christ’s body that signifies and seals the believer’s union. By placing **sacramental realism** within **Spirit-wrought union**, he pursues a via media that affirmatively retrieves historic Reformed convictions while addressing evangelical neglect of **ecclesial mediation**. The church, as the **body of Christ**, is not an optional platform for programs but the sacramental, preaching, and discipling community in which communion with the living Lord is enacted and sustained.

Johnson further consolidates his center in **The Incarnation of God: The Mystery of the Gospel as the Foundation of Evangelical Theology** 2015, coauthored with **John C. Clark**, which contends that the mystery of salvation is grounded in and bounded by the **hypostatic union** confessed at **Chalcedon**. There the authors insist that all doctrinal loci must be normed by the person of the mediator, fully God and fully man, without confusion, change, division, or separation. They develop the **communicatio idiomatum**, the communication of properties from each nature to the one person, and press the **anhypostasis–enhypostasis** distinction to clarify that Christ’s human nature subsists in the eternal person of the Son. The **extra Calvinisticum** is invoked to safeguard the transcendence of the Logos while affirming the true enfleshment of the Redeemer. Their thesis is that evangelical theology loses its center when it abstracts atonement from **incarnation**, and recovers its power when Good Friday and Easter are confessed as the acts of the person who is *homoousios* with the Father and with us.

One payoff of this christological grounding is a corrective to evangelical atonement discourse. Johnson and Clark affirm **penal substitution** as biblically essential, yet only as the self-offering of the incarnate Lord who, in virtue of his person, renders his work sufficient and efficacious. This integrates **federal headship** with **recapitulation**, and **imputation** with **participation**, resisting both moral exemplarism and transactional reduction. The Incarnation is not an optional prelude but the very form of gospel reality. By binding the atonement to **Chalcedonian Christology**, they aim to recenter evangelical identity around a thick confession of the Redeemer rather than thin therapeutic or managerial strategies. Thus **incarnation** and **union** are not rival emphases but mutually implicating truths that, for Johnson, secure the integrity of **evangelical soteriology**.

The strategy of retrieval leads Johnson into conversation with ancient and modern interlocutors who sharpen his proposals. With **Athanasius** and **Irenaeus**, he emphasizes that life is found by participation in the incarnate Son, though he follows **Calvin** in rejecting any collapse of **theosis** into ontological deification. With **Luther**, he underscores the wonder of the **marvelous exchange**, Christ taking our sin and giving us his righteousness, while he maintains a Reformed critique of a **ubiquitarian** Christology that would compromise the integrity of the human nature. In sacramental theology he sides with **Calvin** against **Zwingli**, recovering **spiritual real presence** and the Spirit’s ascent of faith. Among moderns, he resonates with **T. F. Torrance** in his christocentric ontology and ecclesial emphasis, yet he resists collapsing grace into nature by preserving the **Creator-creature distinction** through the extra. He also echoes **John Murray** and **Richard Gaffin** in centering salvation in union with the crucified and risen Christ, affirming the ordo as a function of union rather than its precondition.

One of Johnson’s signature pastoral claims is that the doctrine of **union with Christ** restores gospel assurance and moral transformation without legalism. Because the believer’s life is hidden with Christ in God, **assurance** arises from participation in his person, while **sanctification** is the Spirit’s conforming of the believer to Christ’s image from within that union. This resists voluntarist moralism and therapeutic expressive individualism alike, two afflictions of contemporary evangelical practice. The church’s ministry of **preaching**, **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper** becomes the concrete ecology of communion in which the Spirit binds persons to Christ and to one another. Johnson thus treats mission as the extension of participation, the Spirit’s incorporation of new members into the **body of Christ**, with ecclesial practices functioning as means of grace rather than optional symbols.

Critically, Johnson’s account is carefully bounded by classical christological rules, a feature crucial to his evangelical and Reformed plausibility. The **hypostatic union** is the metaphysical ground that makes participation salvific, since only one who is truly God and truly human can mediate God to humanity and humanity to God. The **communicatio idiomatum** is deployed to ensure that predicates are properly assigned to the person, while avoiding nature-mixing. The **extra Calvinisticum** ensures that the incarnate economy never erases the Son’s eternal fullness, which in turn blocks any pantheizing use of **participation**. This set of rules lets Johnson speak of **deification** with **Athanasius**, yet in a distinctly Reformed sense, deification as adoption and communion by grace, not absorption into the divine essence. He thus exemplifies how evangelical dogmatics can handle metaphysical grammar without retreating from the **sola Scriptura** principle.

Johnson’s significance for the evangelical scene lies in re-knitting **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramentology** around the living Christ. In emphasizing that salvation is Christ himself, received by the Spirit through faith and nourished in the church, he resists a consumerist fragmentation of the Christian life. His constructive agenda is neither antiquarian nor merely academic, but an intervention in pulpit and parish. The retrieval of **Chalcedon** for catechesis, the centering of **union with Christ** for counseling and discipleship, and the recovery of **sacramental realism** for worship together yield a coherent evangelical catholicity. Theologically, the through-line from **incarnation** to **union** to **communion** is his enduring thesis, and institutionally it presses evangelicals toward a more confessional and liturgically formed identity.

Reformed and Westminster evaluation must note both strengths and tensions. Johnson’s centering of **union with Christ** rightly accents a core Reformed theme, and his retrieval of **Calvin’s duplex gratia**, the **extra Calvinisticum**, and the **spiritual real presence** significantly corrects evangelical thinness. Yet care is needed to guard the forensic primacy within the ordo by insisting that **justification by faith alone** has an irreducible declarative integrity within **union**, that **imputation** rests on federal representation and is not ontologized as if the bond were quasi-substantial. The Reformed covenantal frame, **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, can stabilize that forensic accent while preserving participatory breadth. Likewise, his **sacramental realism** should be consistently constrained by the Reformed rule that the sacraments are means of grace effective by the Spirit through faith, never ex opere nor as pre-faith instrumental causes of union. Finally, a Westminster sensibility will press the **Creator-creature distinction** at every turn, affirming Johnson’s use of the **extra** and urging restrained, biblically qualified use of **deification** language. Within these calibrations, Johnson’s program powerfully aligns with classical Reformed orthodoxy and offers evangelicals a doctrinally thick, pastorally fruitful path.
