### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and programmatic aim
R. Scott Clark emerges as a contemporary voice for **confessional Reformed orthodoxy** in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, a period marked by evangelical **revivalism**, **biblicism**, and cross-pressures from **Barthian** revisionism, **neo-Calvinist** cultural programs, **Federal Vision** sacramental objectivism, and **New Perspective** revisions of **Paul**. As a longtime faculty member at **Westminster Seminary California**, his project centers on recovering classic **Reformed theology, piety, and practice** against what he diagnoses as deforming pressures. The pivot of Clark’s contribution is the retrieval of the **ordinary means of grace** ministry of the visible church, structured by the **regulative principle of worship**, interpreted through the **law-gospel distinction**, and publicly bounded by the **Reformed confessions**. Methodologically he combines historical-theological retrieval of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century **Reformed scholasticism** with applied ecclesiology aimed at congregational life. His work is both academic and pastoral, as seen in his scholarly monographs and popular interventions on the **Heidelblog** and **Heidelcast**, where he presses the case for **catechesis**, **psalmody**, and **confessional subscription**.

Clark’s historical moment is decisive for his agenda. The long aftermath of **fundamentalist-evangelical** alignments in the United States had created, in his judgment, an ecclesial culture in Reformed churches that was more **evangelical** than **Reformed**, governed by pragmatic **revival measures** rather than the **means of grace**. At the same time, post-1960s academic theology, refracted through **Barth** and sometimes **neo-Kuyperian** expansions of **grace** into culture, unsettled classic Reformed distinctions concerning **nature and grace**, **law and gospel**, and the **twofold kingdom** of Christ. In response, Clark turns to the original **Reformed orthodox** sources to shore up doctrinal clarity and liturgical discipline, while insisting that ministerial practice must be tethered to the church’s public standards in the **Heidelberg Catechism**, **Belgic Confession**, **Canons of Dort**, and **Westminster Standards**.

#### 2. Method: confessional retrieval, scholastic clarity, and diagnostic categories
The conceptual heart of Clark’s method is **confessionalism** understood as ecclesial normativity. He treats the historic **Reformed confessions** as carefully formulated public theology that defines a church’s doctrine and worship. This leads to his emphasis on robust **confessional subscription** by ministers and elders, resisting both latitudinarian **system subscription** and entrepreneurial identities. He pairs this with a retrieval of **Reformed scholasticism**, following the historiographical lead of **Richard A. Muller** to resist the old **Calvin-vs-the-Calvinists** thesis and to exhibit continuity between **Calvin**, **Ursinus**, **Olevian**, and the later orthodox like **Turretin** and **Witsius**. The scholastic apparatus provides conceptual precision for doctrines like **duplex gratia**, **pactum salutis**, and **imputation**, and it anchors the **law-gospel distinction** and the **ordo salutis** within the covenantal framework.

To analyze the deformations of contemporary church life, Clark introduces two diagnostic tools in his 2008 **Recovering the Reformed Confession**: **QIRE** and **QIRC**. The **Quest for Illegitimate Religious Experience** names the intrusion of revivalist experientialism into Reformed piety, and the **Quest for Illegitimate Religious Certainty** names the biblicist and rationalist drive to secure knowledge outside confessional norms and ordinary churchly means. These conceptual tools function normatively in his ecclesial critique, opposing **revivalism**, **protracted meetings**, and **praise-band liturgies** to the **Word and sacrament** economy ordained by Christ. In Clark’s hands, method is inseparable from pastoral practice: the **regulative principle of worship**, **law-gospel preaching**, and **discipline** embody the confessional theology he retrieves.

#### 3. Caspar Olevian and the substance of the covenant: duplex gratia and union with Christ
Clark’s monograph **Caspar Olevian and the Substance of the Covenant: The Double Benefit of Christ** (2005) is his scholarly cornerstone. Here he argues that the center of early **Reformed covenant theology** lies in **duplex gratia**: the double benefit of **justification** and **sanctification** received by faith from the one Christ, under the one **covenant of grace**. He reads **Olevian** as an architect of a robust covenantal soteriology in which **union with Christ** grounds both the forensic and renovative gifts without collapsing them. Against narratives that pit **Calvin** against later orthodox developments, Clark demonstrates how **Olevian**’s covenantal categories, including the **pactum salutis** as an *ad intra* ground of the *ad extra* **covenant of grace**, anticipate the scholastic refinement of **Witsius** and **Turretin**. The upshot is a historically grounded grammar that maintains **sola fide** in justification while refusing any move that would make sanctification causal for acceptance before God.

In this study, Clark also defends the classic **covenant of works** with **Adam**, not as Pelagian moralism but as a creational-linguistic frame to articulate the **law-gospel distinction** within covenant history. The **covenant of works** renders the covenantal background for **Christ**’s active and passive obedience as the second **Adam**, thereby protecting **imputation** in justification and an unmerited **covenant of grace** for sinners. By rooting these distinctions in sixteenth-century sources, Clark rebuts modern attempts to erase the **covenant of works** or to redefine **union with Christ** in ways that absorb justification into transformation.

#### 4. Recovering the Reformed Confession: theology, piety, and practice
If **Olevian** secures Clark’s historical foundations, **Recovering the Reformed Confession** (2008) delivers the ecclesial program. The thesis is straightforward: Reformed churches must retrieve their **confessional theology**, reshape their **piety** by the **ordinary means**, and reorder their **practice** by the **regulative principle of worship**. The book maps the erosion of confessionally principled worship under the sway of **revivalism** and **consumerism**, arguing that **word-centered preaching**, two **sacraments**, and **prayer** comprise the church’s divinely instituted liturgy. He presses for **psalmody** and the elimination of **images of Christ** on the basis of the **second commandment**, claims historically lodged in the **Heidelberg Catechism** and **Westminster**.

Central to the volume is Clark’s sustained critique of the **evangelical** and **fundamentalist** mind that helped to reshape Reformed communities in North America. Under **QIRE**, he challenges the importation of experiential tests of authenticity that rival **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper**, and under **QIRC** he resists rationalistic biblicism that flattens the confessional grammar of **law and gospel**, **covenant**, and **sacrament**. The pastoral implication is the recovery of a disciplined **catechetical** life, weekly **Lord’s Day** sanctification, and ordered **ministerial office** and **eldership** responsible to the **confession** rather than to ambient market expectations.

#### 5. Two kingdoms, nature and grace, and public theology
A further axis of Clark’s program is the **two kingdoms** doctrine. In line with **Calvin** and the **Reformed orthodox**, and in conversation with contemporary formulations by **David VanDrunen**, Clark distinguishes Christ’s **spiritual kingdom** administered by the church through **Word and sacrament** from his **civil kingdom** administered by common institutions and **natural law**. He resists both the **theonomic** claim that the Mosaic judicials bind modern polities and triumphalist **transformationalism** that conflates ecclesial mandate with cultural programs. Instead, Clark retrieves the confessional revision of **Belgic Confession** article 36 to articulate a principled **religious liberty**, a limited and derivative civil power, and the **spirituality of the church**.

Clark’s nature and grace account is Reformed and anti-**Barthian**. He affirms **creation’s integrity** and a creational **natural law** accessible to image-bearers, while maintaining that saving **grace** is mediated within the church’s **covenant of grace** and not by a culture-wide infusion. This yields a chastened public theology: Christians serve vocations in the common kingdom with neighbor-love and prudence, without expecting ecclesial norms to regulate civil institutions. The benefit of this twofold kingdom is to protect the **gospel** from capture by political projects and to preserve ecclesial energy for **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **discipline**.

#### 6. Justification, assurance, and the Federal Vision controversy
Clark’s confessional retrieval deploys particular force in the arena of **justification by faith alone**. He defends the classic **imputation** of both **Christ’s active and passive obedience**, citing the consensus of **Dort** and **Westminster**, and he rejects proposals for **final justification according to works**. His polemics against **Norman Shepherd**, **Federal Vision** advocates like **Douglas Wilson** and **Peter Leithart**, and **New Perspective** trajectories associated with **N. T. Wright** insist that any instrumental role for **works** in acceptance with God confuses **law and gospel** and jeopardizes **assurance**. In Clark’s reading of **Paul**, the **covenant of grace** delivers a forensic status in union with Christ through faith alone, and sanctification follows as the second aspect of **duplex gratia**, logically distinct even as both are inseparable benefits of the same Christ.

This defense of **sola fide** folds into sacramental theology. Clark denies any **ex opere operato** reading of **baptism** or the **Supper**, while affirming their status as true **means of grace** attached to the **Word** and received by faith. Against **Federal Vision** objectivism that makes **baptism** confer a temporary election or covenantal transfer that may be finally lost, he retrieves the classic Reformed distinction between **decretal election** and **covenantal administration**, the visible and invisible church. The end result is pastoral clarity: assurance rests on **Christ’s imputed righteousness** and God’s promises, not on sacramental possession or covenantal performance.

#### 7. Ecclesiology, worship, and the shape of Reformed piety
Ecclesiologically, Clark insists on the **marks of the true church** as **pure preaching**, **right administration of the sacraments**, and **discipline**, and he ties these marks to the **regulative principle of worship**. He contends that the church’s worship must be ordered by what God commands rather than by prudential innovations, which leads him to promote **psalmody**, qualities of reverent **prayer**, and the centrality of **expository preaching** with a pronounced **law-gospel** structure. He argues that **images of Christ** breach the **second commandment**, appealing to **Ursinus** and **Calvin**, and that the communion of saints is nourished by the ordinary, not the extraordinary. His ecclesiology is office-centered, affirming the **minister**, **elders**, and **deacons** as Christ’s gifts for the maturation of the body through catechesis and discipline according to the **confession**.

In pastoral practice, the upshot is a rehabilitated Reformed **piety**. Clark encourages weekly **Lord’s Day** observance, family and congregational **catechism** instruction, and participation in the **means** that deliver **duplex gratia**. He is skeptical of **spiritual formation** programs that bypass ecclesial means, and he questions **worship bands**, **altar calls**, and other practices that betray **QIRE**. Instead, the church should rest in the sufficiency of the **Word read and preached**, **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper** as Christ’s appointed conduits of grace.

#### 8. Historiography and the Calvin-vs-the-Calvinists debate
Historically, Clark aligns with the **post-Muller** reassessment of **Reformed orthodoxy**. He rejects the older narrative that opposed **Calvin’s** spirituality and biblicity to a later scholastic rationalism, arguing instead for substantial continuity in doctrine and method from the **Reformation** through **orthodoxy**. By highlighting figures such as **Caspar Olevian**, **Zacharias Ursinus**, **Francis Turretin**, and **Herman Witsius**, he demonstrates that **covenant theology**, the **covenant of works**, the **pactum salutis**, and precise accounts of **imputation** and **union** were not aberrations but mainstream developments. The 1999 collection **Protestant Scholasticism: Essays in Reassessment** that he co-edited amplifies this historiographical thesis, urging theologians to prize scholastic clarity as a pastoral tool rather than dismiss it as alien to Reformed spirituality.

This historiography has polemical reach. It undermines appeals to **Calvin** against the **confessions** on matters of **worship**, **sacraments**, or **civil polity**, and it pushes back against modern synthetic programs that absorb Reformed distinctives into broader **evangelical** or **ecumenical** frameworks. By insisting on confessional continuity, Clark justifies his call to recover the **Reformed confession** not as antiquarianism but as ecclesial fidelity.

#### 9. Communication, pedagogy, and ongoing debates
Beyond the monographs, Clark’s public work through the **Heidelblog** and **Heidelcast** illustrates his didactic strategy: translating **Reformed scholastic** categories into accessible pastoral counsel. He regularly interacts with contemporary debates about **Christian nationalism**, **theonomy**, **neo-Calvinist** cultural theory, **final justification**, and **union with Christ**, often offering pointed critiques and extensive citations from **Reformed confessional** documents. His alliance with colleagues like **Michael Horton** and **David VanDrunen** situates him in a network committed to the **two kingdoms**, **natural law**, and **ordinary means**, while his appreciation for **Klinean** insights on the **covenant of works** and republication debates is tempered by consistent appeal to **Witsius** and the broader **orthodox** tradition. The result is an integrated platform: academic retrieval, ecclesial reform, and lay catechesis in a confessional key.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Clark’s strengths are evident: a firm defense of **sola fide** and **imputation**, a historically grounded **duplex gratia** that refuses synergism, a principled **two kingdoms** account that guards the **gospel’s spirituality**, and a rigorous **regulative principle** that resists consumer liturgies. Tensions emerge where his **two kingdoms** and **natural law** proposals meet **neo-Calvinist** emphases on **creation’s goodness** and cultural **vocation**; some worry he constricts the scope of **grace** in public life or underplays creational **wisdom** in worship adiaphora. His **QIRC/QIRE** diagnoses, while clarifying, can risk overdrawn binaries that reduce the breadth of Reformed experiential traditions evident in **Puritan** and **Dutch** piety. On **republication** and the **covenant of works**, detractors fear an unstable law-gospel disjunction, though Clark replies with **Witsius** and **Turretin** to affirm substantive continuity of the **covenant of grace**. From a Westminster tradition perspective, the most constructive alternative is not to abandon Clark’s program but to widen its resources: retrieve **Bavinck’s** organic motif for **nature and grace**, embrace **Kuyper’s** principled pluralism while retaining the **spirituality of the church**, and integrate the best of historic **Reformed experiential piety** under the **ordinary means**. Clark’s core thesis stands: the church’s health is bound to the **confession**, and the **means of grace** must govern Reformed identity in doctrine, worship, and pastoral care.
