### ESSAY
#### 1. Context and formation: a retrieval theologian of the Reformed orthodox
Todd Rester emerges within the twenty-first-century resurgence of **Reformed scholasticism**, a scholarly and ecclesial **ressourcement** responding to dislocations in **classical theism**, **doctrinal catechesis**, and the link between **exegesis and dogmatics**. His institutional home at **Westminster Theological Seminary** from 2022 positions him in a lineage that includes **B. B. Warfield**, **Geerhardus Vos**, and **Cornelius Van Til**, yet his specialty is the early modern tradition of **Mastricht, Turretin, Junius, and Voetius**. Rester’s vocation is neither speculative metaphysics nor idiosyncratic system building, but the painstaking **historical-theological retrieval** of sources and methods that once structured Reformed **dogmatics, polemics, and piety**. He labors to re-open the workshop of classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, insisting that theological method is inseparable from pastoral ends. In this his signature contribution is to make **Petrus van Mastricht’s Theoretical-Practical Theology** accessible in full and in English between 2018 and 2023, with introductions and notes that foreground **method** and illuminate **doctrinal loci** for contemporary readers.

Rester’s epistemic stance is anchored in **Franciscus Junius’s** distinction between **theologia archetypa and theologia ectypa**, a grammar that recasts theology as sharing in a creaturely **habitus** of wisdom rather than a comprehensive science of divine essence. Building on early modern prolegomena, he underscores **Scripture as principium cognoscendi externum** and the **Spirit as principium internum**, while God himself is the **principium essendi** of all theology. This principial architecture orders a modest and analogical account of theological knowledge, aligning with **Calvin’s** **sensus divinitatis** yet subordinating any **theologia naturalis** to Scripture’s normative light. Rester’s goal is methodological: to re-habituate pastors and students to the scholastic **exegesis–doctrine–elenctics–practice** sequence in order to stabilize doctrine, refine polemics, and animate piety.

#### 2. Key works and method: reintroducing Mastricht’s theoretical-practical pattern
The heart of Rester’s published work is his translation and editorial stewardship of **Petrus van Mastricht, Theoretical-Practical Theology** in seven volumes with **Reformation Heritage Books** from 2018 to 2023. The project is more than linguistic: in translator’s introductions and notes Rester interprets **Mastricht’s fourfold method** as a corrective to modern fragmentation between **biblical studies**, **systematics**, and **practical theology**. Each locus in Mastricht proceeds by 1) **exegesis** of key texts, 2) **doctrinal articulation**, 3) **elenctic refutation** of adversaries, and 4) **practical uses** for faith and obedience, thereby uniting **truth and godliness** within a single discipline. Rester presses the point that this is not merely a Puritan homiletic overlay but the Reformed orthodox norm grounded in **Junius’s prolegomena**, **Ames’s** account of theology as a **habitus**, and **Voetius’s** elenctic rigor.

Rester also retrieves Mastricht’s pastoral aim, one famously commended by **Jonathan Edwards** who preferred Mastricht for divinity in general. By diagnosing a fracture between **theory and practice** in modern curricula, Rester argues that Mastricht’s comprehensive pattern buffers the church against both speculative **metaphysical overreach** and **pragmatic anti-doctrinalism**. The structure of each chapter models how **Scripture’s exegesis** yields **dogmatic clarity**, how confessional **polemics** are measured by truth and charity, and how **practical syllogisms** seal teaching in the conscience. The point is not antiquarianism but **pastoral formation**, a trait Rester brings into classrooms and prefaces alike.

#### 3. Prolegomena and principia: archetypal–ectypal wisdom against mutualism
At the level of prolegomena Rester foregrounds **archetypal–ectypal** theology as a master key. This grammar both fences and frees doctrine. It fences by ruling out any **univocal predication** of the divine essence and by safeguarding **divine simplicity, immutability, and impassibility** against contemporary **theistic mutualism** and **open theism**. It frees by allowing robust **analogical naming** grounded in revelation, especially **Scripture as principium cognoscendi**, so that predicates like **goodness**, **wisdom**, and **love** are true of God without implying composition, potentiality, or passibility in God. Rester shows how **Mastricht and Turretin** move from **biblical exegesis** to **metaphysical negation and eminence**, deploying the traditional **via triplex** to secure **classical theism**.

Within this principial frame Rester articulates early modern distinctions central to the Reformed scholastic workshop. He clarifies **principium essendi** as God’s self-sufficient being and **principium cognoscendi** in its external and internal forms as **Scripture** and **Spirit**. He delineates the use and limits of **theologia naturalis** as an organic yet subordinate witness grounded in **Romans 1** and **Psalm 19**. He highlights the **habitus theologicus** as a Spirit-formed virtue that unites knowledge and piety. These moves offer a disciplined alternative both to **Barthian actualism** that collapses theology into event and to **analytic voluntarism** that dissolves nature into will, while staying within the classical **Reformed orthodox** idiom.

#### 4. God and attributes: classical theism restored to exegetical control
In translating and framing Mastricht’s treatment of **divine names and attributes**, Rester re-centers **exegetical method** while restoring the **metaphysical grammar** of **simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He emphasizes that for Mastricht and the wider **Reformed orthodoxy**, doctrines like **divine simplicity** are not speculative axioms but conclusions ordered by Scripture’s witness to the one **YHWH** who simply is. Against modern claims that simplicity undermines **Trinitarian** or **biblical** depictions of God’s pathos, Rester showcases how Mastricht’s careful exegesis of texts such as **Exodus 3**, **James 1**, and **Acts 14** anchors classical doctrines that then receive a scholastic refinement through **via negationis** and **via eminentiae**.

At the same time Rester uses Mastricht’s **elenctic** sections to map historical and contemporary adversaries. He exposes how **Socinians** denied **pre-existence and deity** in ways mirrored in modern **functional Christologies**, and how **Remonstrants** displaced **grace** with **synergism** analogous to some contemporary **semi-Pelagian** currents. In the attributes, the targets include **process theism** and **relational theism**, whose commitments to divine passibility and change collide with the **immutability** and **pure actuality** entailed by Scripture and confessed by the Reformed. Rester’s contribution is pedagogical clarity: he stages the **exegetical evidence**, articulates the **dogma**, confronts **opposition**, and culminates in **practical uses** for reverence and trust.

#### 5. Creation, providence, and natural knowledge: principled subordination
Rester’s retrieval treats **creation and providence** as the theater where **natural knowledge of God** properly functions. He follows Mastricht in affirming **general revelation** and a ministerial **theologia naturalis** that draws upon the created order, conscience, and the historical works of God. Yet he stresses the principial subordination of this natural knowledge to **Scripture**, thus sustaining the **analogia fidei** against speculative **analogia entis** claims that would operate apart from revelation. This dialectic allows Rester to receive early modern arguments for the existence of God, prudently framed by **Junius’s** principia and **Calvin’s** **sensus divinitatis**, while resisting both **rationalist autonomy** and **fideist reduction**.

In providence, Rester leans with Mastricht into **concursus** and **compatibilism**, defending the exhaustive sovereignty of God over means and ends without violating **secondary causes**. He retrieves the classic distinction between **God’s will of decree** and **will of precept**, gives room for **uses** that cultivate patience under affliction and diligence in vocation, and shows how the older elenctic dialogues with **Stoicism**, **Epicureanism**, and **Arminianism** cash out today against **deterministic naturalism** and **libertarian freedom** proposals.

#### 6. Covenant and Christ: law and gospel in a practical frame
A distinctive feature of Rester’s retrieval is the clarity with which **covenant theology** structures **soteriology**. He highlights Mastricht’s exposition of the **foedus naturae** or **covenant of works** and the **foedus gratiae** or **covenant of grace**, showing how **law–gospel** dialectic governs both doctrinal contour and pastoral uses. The **covenant of works** reveals the original **law** in Adam with its demand of perfect obedience and the consequent **federal headship**, while the **covenant of grace** unfolds in redemptive history culminating in the **mediatorial offices of Christ** as **prophet, priest, and king**. Rester’s prefaces and teaching mark how this framework answers both **antinomianism** and **legalism** by locating **obedience** within **union with Christ** and the **ordo salutis**.

On **Christology**, Rester foregrounds Chalcedonian **homoousios** and **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** as the grammar within which **incarnation** and **atonement** are expounded. Translating Mastricht’s careful dogmatic and elenctic work, he features the **penal substitution** and **satisfaction** models as the orthodox resolution to sin and guilt, while noting historic objections from **Socinians** and **Remonstrants**. Each Christological and soteriological locus culminates in Mastricht’s **practical applications**, which Rester accentuates as the mark of **Reformed scholasticism** at its best: doctrines terminating in **doxology**, **assurance**, and **obedience**.

#### 7. Church, means of grace, and piety: scholastic precision for pastoral cure
Rester’s retrieval does not stall at metaphysics or soteriology, but extends to **ecclesiology**, the **means of grace**, and **piety**. He translates and frames Mastricht’s treatments of **Word and sacrament**, **discipline**, and **public worship** with confessional clarity, aligning with the **Westminster Standards** on **preaching**, **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper**. The scholastic precision of **definitions, distinctions, and uses** is never an end in itself; it is marshaled to clarify the **cure of souls**. Rester shows how Mastricht’s method insists that every doctrinal determination seeks its terminus in **holiness and comfort**, thereby rebutting the caricature of scholasticism as arid.

By representing Mastricht’s thorough **catechetical** intent, Rester equips pastors to move from **text** to **doctrine** to **practice** in sermons and catechesis. He presses the **habitus theologicus** as a pastoral virtue, joining **truth and love**. In these ways Rester recovers the **Reformed pastoral scholastic** as a model for contemporary ministry that resists both **anti-intellectualism** and **pragmatism** while avoiding speculative obscurity.

#### 8. Polemics old and new: elenctics for contemporary doctrine
A retrieval of **elenctics** is crucial to Rester’s project. Guided by Mastricht, he reactivates the calibrated habit of naming and answering opponents, historically **Roman Catholic**, **Socinian**, **Remonstrant**, and **Cartesian**, but presently **process**, **open theist**, and **relational** revisions of **classical theism**. Rester patiently maps how older arguments about **simplicity**, **immutability**, **foreknowledge**, and **grace** translate into today’s debates with **theistic mutualism**, as well as the pressures of **analytic theology** to relocate doctrine into models that risk univocity. He also shows how older **anti-Socinian** exegesis of texts on **atonement** and **deity of Christ** speak with precision into renewed **penal substitution** debates.

This polemical habit is matched by irenic clarity. Rester locates key **confessional boundaries** and distinguishes them from wider **catholic** inheritance. He stresses that **classical metaphysics** serves Scripture, and that metaphysical claims like **pure actuality** and **impassibility** are guardrails for biblical description rather than alien impositions. The elenctic posture, therefore, is a pastoral service: it strives to protect the flock by clarifying truth and exposing error without starving the church of application.

#### 9. Pedagogy and institutional vocation: Westminster and the curriculum of wisdom
Rester’s appointment at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in 2022 consolidates his role as a mediator between **early modern Reformed orthodoxy** and contemporary **Reformed confessionalism**. In teaching **church history** and related seminars, he advances a curricular vision in which **historical theology** is not an archive but a **tool-box** for **systematic**, **biblical**, and **practical** theology. The translation of Mastricht supplies a backbone for courses and ministerial formation, while prefaces and lectures inculcate the **exegetical–dogmatic–elenctic–practical** habit as the pastor’s ordinary work.

Institutionally Rester participates in a broader Protestant **ressourcement** that includes editions of **Turretin**, the promotion of **Richard Muller’s** historiography of **post-Reformation Reformed dogmatics**, and contemporary defenses of **divine simplicity** by figures like **James Dolezal** and **Scott Swain**. Rester’s comparative advantage is to seat these debates within a working model for preaching and catechesis rooted in **Mastricht’s method**. In this way, method and content feed each other: **classical theism** is retrieved as biblically compelled doctrine, and pastoral theology is strengthened by the scholastic order of learning.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: strengths, tensions, and integrative prospects
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Rester’s contribution is a decisive consolidation of **confessional orthodoxy** by restoring the **methods and sources** of **Reformed scholasticism**. His strengths are manifold: a principled commitment to **archetypal–ectypal** modesty, a clear recovery of **principia** that place **Scripture** and **Spirit** at the center of theological knowing, a patient defense of **classical theism**, and a pedagogical insistence on **practice** as theology’s terminus. Two tensions invite further work. First, the reception of **natural theology**: Mastricht’s ministerial **theologia naturalis** must be carefully articulated alongside **Van Til’s** critique of autonomous reason, so that **general revelation** is affirmed within a **covenantal epistemology** without ceding ground to the **analogia entis** or neutral foundations. Second, the relation of **scholastic loci** to **Vosian biblical theology**: Rester’s fourfold method is intrinsically hospitable to **redemptive-historical** exegesis, but it requires deliberate integration so that the unfolding of **covenant history** informs dogmatic ordering and avoids flattening **history into system**. The constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is complementary: allow **biblical theology** to supply salvation-historical architecture and **scholastic dogmatics** to deliver conceptual precision, bound by **principia** and mobilized for **piety**. Rester’s work supplies the tools, the grammar, and the exemplars for precisely this synthesis.
