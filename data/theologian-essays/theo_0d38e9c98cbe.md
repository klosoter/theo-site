### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Bruno Latour, born in 1947 in Beaune and deceased in 2022, emerged as a central voice in contemporary French **science and technology studies** who reconfigured debates on **modernity** and **religion**. Educated in philosophy and anthropology and long affiliated with the **Ecole des Mines** and later **Sciences Po**, Latour conducted laboratory ethnographies and institutional experiments that forged a distinctive method of **symmetrical anthropology**. The symmetry thesis insists that explanations of belief, truth, and error must employ the same kinds of causes, thus dismantling the modern asymmetry that treats science as pure **reason** and religion as mere **culture**. His signature contribution, **actor-network theory**, traces the **associations** that compose collectives of humans and nonhumans, revealing **mediation**, **translation**, and **enrollment** as the real engines of social and natural order. The early collaboration **Laboratory Life, 1979** with Steve Woolgar, and later **Science in Action, 1987**, exemplify this empirical strategy by following scientists at work, treating instruments, inscriptions, and organisms as **actants** whose agency is distributed across networks of **practice**.

The historical and intellectual milieu of post-1968 France, with its suspicion of grand narratives and renewed attention to **practices** and **devices**, sharpened Latour's polemic against the modern divide between **Nature** and **Society**. His method aligns with the constructivist impulses of **Kuhn** and the Edinburgh **strong programme** yet rejects reductionist sociologism by granting causal and agential weight to nonhumans as **actants**. The goal is neither to debunk facts nor to romanticize belief, but to describe the **mediations** through which durable objects and true statements are composed. This compositional realism, later named **compositionism**, orients Latour toward a reimagined metaphysics of **plural ontologies** and toward a political theology of **collectives** that include **things**.

#### 2. We Have Never Been Modern and the modern constitution
Latour's pivotal text **We Have Never Been Modern, 1991** diagnoses the modern self-understanding as a myth sustained by two simultaneous yet contradictory operations. On one side, **purification** asserts a sharp ontological split between **Nature** as objective and **Society** as constructed. On the other side, **translation** incessantly proliferates **hybrids** that mingle artifacts, organisms, texts, and institutions. The modern constitution hides translation behind the rhetoric of purification, thereby rendering its own practices unintelligible. Latour's remedy is the **Parliament of Things**, a new political and epistemic forum where humans and nonhumans appear via their **spokespersons** to negotiate the terms of common life. The result is not a relativist muddle but an enlarged realism that treats facts as **matters of concern** stabilized through chains of **reference**.

This reframing bears theological weight because it dislodges the disenchanting opposition of **facts** and **values**, a dichotomy that has often rendered **religion** a private supplement to public knowledge. By foregrounding **mediation** and **assemblage**, Latour opens conceptual space for sacramental, liturgical, and doxological practices to be understood as world-making rather than as symbolic glosses. The languages of **iconoclash** and **iconophilia** that he later develops flow from the same insight that representations are never mere mirrors but **events** that shape relations of truth and trust.

#### 3. Science, practice, and matters of concern
The empirical core of Latour's project unfolds across **The Pasteurization of France, 1984**, **Science in Action, 1987**, and **Reassembling the Social, 2005**, where he tracks how laboratories, legal documents, microbes, and political allies are aligned in webs of **translation**. In **The Pasteurization of France** he narrates how **Pasteurian** microbiology realized a national transformation through alliances of scientists, hygienists, farmers, and microbes, thereby dissolving any simplistic separation of **nature** and **society**. **Science in Action** arms readers with methodological maxims such as following controversies, tracing **inscriptions**, and attending to **obligatory passage points** by which actors gain or lose control of networks. **Reassembling the Social** crystallizes his alternative to structuralist **society** by defining the social as the movement of **associations**, not a domain or substance.

These inquiries culminate in the contrast between **matters of fact** and **matters of concern**, a now-canonical phrase. Facts are not discarded but redescribed as fragile achievements requiring **chains of reference** that link field sites, instruments, inscriptions, and publics. Concerns gather practices and attachments around propositions without invoking a mythic, view-from-nowhere **Nature**. The result is a chastened **realism** grounded in practices of **reference** and **care**, an outlook that will later inform Latour's interpretation of **religious speech** and his ecological politics under the sign of **Gaia**.

#### 4. Political ecology, Gaia, and the critical zone
Latour's political thought matures in **Politics of Nature, 2004**, where the **Parliament of Things** becomes a procedural vision for collective inquiry and decision. He replaces the modern tribunal of **Science** with a phased process that brings propositions into due trial, mobilizes **spokespersons** for nonhumans, and renders explicit the **felicity conditions** for inclusion in the common world. This political ecology opposes both technocratic **epistocracy** and romantic **naturalism**, insisting on the slow composition of a common world through **procedural pluralism**.

The ecological urgency of the **Anthropocene** intensifies in **Facing Gaia, 2017**, based on his **Gifford Lectures**, and in **Down to Earth, 2018**. Here **Gaia**, drawn from **Lovelock** and **Lynn Margulis** yet stripped of mythic connotations, names the Earth system as a contingent, reactive, and recalcitrant assemblage of feedbacks. Gaia is not a mother goddess but a political-theological interlocutor that de-centers **Modern Man** and demands the humility of **terrestrial** attachments. Latour appropriates the geoscientific notion of the **critical zone**, the thin layer where life persists, to argue for a new geopolitics of **attachment**, **limits**, and **situated knowledges** akin to **Haraway's** insistence on partial perspectives. This orientation resonates with his earlier **compositionism** by insisting that a liveable world must be built through carefully articulated **mediations** among humans and nonhumans.

#### 5. Religion, iconoclash, and Rejoicing
Although not a confessional theologian, Latour intervenes directly in religious discourse in **On the Modern Cult of the Factish Gods, 2010**, **Iconoclash, 2002**, and **Rejoicing: Or the Torments of Religious Speech, 2013**. The polemic against **iconoclasm** targets the modern habit of exposing others' idols while overlooking one's own **factishes**, a neologism marking the indistinguishability of facts and fetishes once their **mediations** are traced. He rehabilitates **iconophilia**, the love of images, by showing that all access to truth is mediated through signs that transform their users. In **Rejoicing** he argues that **religious speech** is not about information or belief-as-opinion but about transformation under conditions of **felicity**. The Gospel is an enacted address that renews the present, like a declaration of love that creates what it names. Religious utterances thus have distinctive **modes of veridiction** and distinctive **proofs**, not reducible to either propositional verification or private emotion.

This is extended in **An Inquiry into Modes of Existence, 2012**, where **REL**, the mode of religion, is defined by a trajectory of **conversion**, **visitation**, and **renewal** that generates durable relationships through faithful repetition. Latour's aim is not to insulate religion from critique but to specify its conditions of **truth** and **error** analogously to how **REF** specifies scientific reference and how **LAW** specifies juridical veridiction. The upshot is a plural, rule-governed space in which **religion** is public not because it mirrors **Nature** but because it recomposes persons and communities through acknowledged **mediations** that can succeed or fail.

#### 6. AIME and ontological pluralism
**An Inquiry into Modes of Existence, 2012** is Latour's most systematic statement, proposing a map of **modes** that includes science, law, religion, politics, technology, fiction, and more, each with its own **trajectory**, **hiatus**, and **felicity conditions**. Rather than a monocular metaphysics, he offers an **ontological pluralism** in which beings subsist by the grace of their modes. **REF** secures truth via reproducible chains of **reference** that traverse instruments and inscriptions. **POL** engenders the common via the risky articulation of a people. **LAW** creates durable obligations by instituting proper procedures and appeals. **TEC** extends agency through devices that stabilize delegations and scripts. **REL** renews relationships by repeating the message that transforms. This plural map allows for **diplomacy** among modes so that conflicts are adjudicated without collapsing distinct kinds of **veridiction** into one imperial standard.

The conceptual core of AIME rests on **mediation** and **attachment**. Every mode advances by crossing a **hiatus** that cannot be bridged by brute force, so each mode devises a characteristic **proof**. Religion crosses the hiatus by sending a messenger whose speech repairs time, law by issuing a decision that binds, science by multiplying reliable chains of **reference**. The articulation of these proofs, along with the possibility of **category mistakes** where one mode judges another by foreign standards, functions as both a metaphysical and a theological grammar. It guards **religious speech** from reduction to psychology while protecting **scientific practice** from being divinized as an oracle of pure **Nature**.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and theological inflections
Latour's work unfolds in continuous dialogue with **Michel Serres** and **Isabelle Stengers**, adopting from them a taste for **quasi-objects** and a sensitivity to the **event** of knowledge. **Whitehead's** process metaphysics informs his sense of a world composed through **prehensions**, plural **modes**, and the creative advance of **actual occasions**, though Latour remains wary of system building that outruns **empirical** description. The debates with **Kuhn** and the **Edinburgh school** sharpen his rejection of sociological reductionism in favor of **actor-network** description. With **Habermas**, he disputes the placement of religion in a privatized sphere and contests proceduralist views of **public reason** that cordon off **nonhumans**. In the philosophical ecology of **Facing Gaia**, he argues against both Promethean **ecomodernism** and apocalyptic **resignation**, calling instead for terrestrial **attachments** that recast political **sovereignty**.

Within contemporary philosophy, **Graham Harman** criticizes Latour for undermining the autonomy of objects through an excessive emphasis on **relations**, while Latour replies that **translation** and **mediation** are the only routes to durable objecthood. In the art-theory interventions of **Iconoclash**, Latour stages a conversation with iconophiles who treasure **images** as sites of presence and with iconoclasts who mistake **representation** for mere illusion. These exchanges bear theological fruit by rehabilitating practices of **veneration**, **testimony**, and **sacrament** as modes of truth-claiming that are neither irrational nor merely symbolic, since they mobilize the same fundamental grammar of **mediated** veridiction he discerns across domains.

#### 8. Doctrinal stakes and constructive possibilities
Theological stakes in Latour's oeuvre gather around three knots. First is the critique of the modern split between **Nature and Society**, which reopens questions of **creation** and **providence** by foregrounding **creaturely mediations**. By insisting that truth travels through chains of **reference**, Latour normalizes a world where **sacrament**, **Scripture**, and **witness** are not obstacles to truth but its necessary conduits. Second is the reframing of **religion** as a mode with its own **felicity conditions**, where **Rejoicing** locates religious truth in transformative address rather than in bare propositions. This pushes theologians to reconsider **incarnation** and **resurrection** not as informational facts detachable from liturgical life, but as events that renew the present through faithful **repetition**. Third is **Gaia**, which acts as a destabilizing figure for any theology that relies on a static **Nature** to underwrite natural theology, while inviting a chastened **cosmology** attentive to **limits**, **attachment**, and the **critical zone** where life is sustained.

These trajectories create possibilities and dangers. The possibility is a catholic recovery of **mediation** as a created good that routes divine **grace** through creaturely signs, consonant with an ontology of **participation** and a politics of **stewardship**. The danger is the collapse of the **Creator-creature distinction** into a flat commons of **actants**, where **Gaia** begins to function as an immanent quasi-divine horizon and where **religious speech** risks being redescribed as a mode among modes without reference to **revelation** that judges and renews all modes. The decisive question for theology becomes how to keep Latour's grammar of **mediations** while articulating the **triune God** as the living Lord whose acts exceed and ground every network of **translation**.

#### 9. Legacy for theology and beyond
By turning matters of fact into **matters of concern**, Latour crafted an intellectual environment where theological claims can be voiced without accepting a ghettoized status. His **Parliament of Things** is not a church, yet it offers a procedural imagination in which **spokespersons** for creatures and communities can deliberate about the good under conditions of **pluralism**. His **AIME** project gives theologians a map for negotiating conflicts among **science**, **politics**, **law**, and **religion** without capitulation to hegemonic naturalism. In the **Anthropocene**, **Facing Gaia** supplies a chastened apocalyptic that expects shocks and feedbacks, calling for penitential **attachments** rather than technocratic mastery. For practical theology, **Rejoicing** dignifies preaching, prayer, and sacrament as truth-bearing **mediations** that transform their hearers under publicly testable **felicity conditions**.

Outside theology, Latour's influence spans **STS**, **anthropology**, **political theory**, **art theory**, and **environmental humanities**, where his insistence on **translation** and **hybrids** has become axiomatic. Exhibitions like **Iconoclash, 2002**, and **Making Things Public, 2005**, performed his theses by staging encounters among **images**, **instruments**, and **institutions**. His later advocacy for the **critical zone** as a research and civic locus exemplifies his practical turn to institutions that can bear **terrestrial** weight. This legacy leaves theologians with both tools and tests for confessing the **Creator** amid the networks of creation.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster perspective, Latour's gains and losses are sharply profiled. Positively, the exposure of the **fact value split** and the critique of disembodied **scientism** align with a covenantal epistemology that denies **neutrality** and insists that all knowing is perspectival, mediated, and moral. The emphasis on **mediations** and **attachments** can be received as a reminder that God ordinarily works through created **means of grace**, that **Scripture** is an ensemble of divinely authorized **witnesses** rather than a dropped-from-heaven oracle, and that **creation care** in the **critical zone** belongs to **vicegerency** under Christ. Negatively, Latour's ontological **flattening** of humans and nonhumans into a common actorly plane threatens the **Creator-creature distinction** that grounds **providence**, **covenant**, and **worship**. His **REL mode** construal of **religious speech** as transformative address underestimates the necessity of divinely given **propositional revelation** concerning **incarnation** and **resurrection** as events in history. The figure of **Gaia** risks becoming a rival **natural religion**, an immanent totality that elides **providence** and **eschatology**. A Reformed alternative would appropriate Latour's **matters of concern** and **compositionism** as critiques of modern naturalism, while re-anchoring **mediations** in the triune **revelation** that orders all creaturely networks under **covenant lordship**, upholding history as the theater of **redemption** and the **church** as the Spirit's polity where truth is confessed, tested, and sent.
