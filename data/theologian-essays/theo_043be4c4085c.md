### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The public career of **Michael Kearns** unfolds within the late twentieth and early twenty-first century consolidation of **machine learning**, **data economics**, and **algorithmic governance**, where computational systems mediate credit, policing, labor markets, and discourse. As a computer scientist at the **University of Pennsylvania**, his work exemplifies how technical disciplines have become normative interlocutors in questions of **justice** and **agency** traditionally owned by jurisprudence and theology. The timeline matters. The theoretical consolidation of **computational learning theory** in the 1990s set the stage for the 2010s wave of fairness and privacy debates, culminating in his coauthored **The Ethical Algorithm** in 2019, which signaled to broader publics that normative claims can be engineered as constraints. Against the background of **platform capitalism** and pervasive surveillance, Kearns presses a thesis that moral desiderata such as **fairness** and **privacy** can be formalized and then enforced in the design of systems. That thesis has immediate traction for **systematic theology**, whose concerns with *ordo creationis*, **imago Dei**, and **public justice** now intersect with the design choices of technologists.

Kearns’s method is a disciplined **formalism**. Rather than treating ethics as after-the-fact audit, he frames moral goals as **mathematical constraints** and **objective functions** within machine learning. His vocabulary is not confessional but civic and empirical. Still, his stance has a recognizable epistemic profile. It trades on **model-based reasoning**, **empirical risk minimization**, and **game-theoretic** analysis of strategic behavior, building algorithms that satisfy provable guarantees like **differential privacy** or **equalized odds**. This is a public-reason proceduralism, suspicious of unconstrained appeals to thick moral notions but hospitable to any norm that can be rendered as a constraint. The theological payoff is methodological. It invites Christian ethicists to ask which **lex naturalis** claims admit formalization without loss, and where thick **teleology** and **virtue** resist translation into the grammar of constraints.

#### 2. Early work and the architecture of learning
The 1990s foundational text **An Introduction to Computational Learning Theory** 1994, coauthored with **Umesh Vazirani**, is not an ethics book yet it underwrites later normative proposals. The book consolidates the **PAC model** of learning, sample complexity, and bounds on generalization, clarifying when finite data can yield reliable inferences. For theology this maps onto the boundedness of human knowledge after the Fall, invoking **noetic effects of sin** without presuming theological language. The idea that inducers can overfit, misgeneralize, or be biased by data distribution anticipates structural concerns about **algorithmic discrimination** and **feedback loops** in the 2010s. Kearns’s early work thus supplies an epistemic modesty compatible with Augustinian **finitude** and **concupiscentia**, even as it remains secular in tone. It provides tools for discerning when claims about systemic bias are statistically legible and when they are artifacts of model choice or data drift, a distinction central to **public justice**.

The formative encounter here is between **learning theory** and **social choice**. The same mathematics that delimit what concepts are learnable also constrain what moral desiderata can be co-satisfied. Later fairness debates will discover impossibility theorems, such as the 2016 insights associated with **Jon Kleinberg** on the incompatibility of calibration with equal error rates across groups under base-rate disparities. Theologically, such impossibility mirrors the tragic structure of **postlapsarian** trade-offs, where goods conflict and where prudence must rank goods under **providence**. Kearns’s early corpus furnishes a grammar in which those trade-offs can be stated precisely.

#### 3. The Ethical Algorithm and the turn to normative design
The public thesis of **The Ethical Algorithm** 2019, coauthored with **Aaron Roth**, is that we can engineer socially desirable properties directly into algorithms by operationalizing norms as **constraints**. The book popularizes technical guarantees like **differential privacy**, which bounds the influence of any single individual on an output, thereby protecting persons from reidentification even under auxiliary information. It treats **fairness** through families of constraints, from **demographic parity** to **equalized odds** and **calibration**, arguing for context-sensitive choice among them. It introduces **strategic classification** and **performative prediction**, recognizing that people respond to models, which in turn changes the world the model is trying to represent. It flags **filter bubbles** and **echo chambers**, proposing design levers to blunt polarization without paternalism. The book’s signature move is to insist that moral norms can be made precise enough to shape code and thus outcomes. That insistence makes Kearns a key interlocutor for **Christian social ethics**, which must parse when constraint-based deontology suffices and when thicker accounts of **virtue**, **ends**, and **common good** exceed the idiom of provable guarantees.

For systematic theology, the triad of **privacy**, **fairness**, and **accountability** functions as a set of civic goods that resonate with **imago Dei** and the dignity of persons. Privacy aligns with protections for the self as a bearer of **dignitas** and as a covenantal agent in **family** and **church** spheres. Fairness aligns with **ius** under natural and divine law, ranging from proportionality to impartiality. Accountability aligns with political **subsidiarity** and **sphere sovereignty**, ensuring that power is ordered and answerable. The question becomes whether these goods can be adequately specified in the idiom of constraints. Kearns presses the case that at least some core protections can be, as with **differential privacy** and certain fairness constraints, and that design-time choices dominate after-the-fact audits in efficacy.

#### 4. Central categories refracted through Christian doctrine
The algorithmic lexicon maps fruitfully onto classical loci. In **anthropology**, the practice of **de-identification** and privacy by design concretizes the theological claim that persons are more than their data. The logic of **differential privacy** treats each record as an inviolable contribution whose risk must be bounded, an echo of the Christian insistence on **neighbor-love** as protective of the vulnerable. In **hamartiology**, the empirical reality of **bias amplification** and **feedback loops** provides a secular analogue to the Augustinian dynamics of **disordered loves** and institutionalized sin. The model learns from a world bent by injustice, then reinscribes that injustice at scale. In **providence**, the discourse of **performative prediction** and **mechanism design** shows how secondary causes order social interaction, reminding theologians that God’s governance often employs creaturely structures that are formal and incentive-laden rather than merely exhortative. In **ecclesiology**, the attendant risks of **technocracy** warn churches against outsourcing moral discernment to metrics, even while adopting tools that secure **stewardship** of information and care.

The central lesson is constraint and limit. The fairness **impossibility results** are not merely technical curiosities. They instantiate a tragic moral topology in which no scheme attains every distributive good simultaneously when groups have different base rates. That reality solicits a theology of **prudence** and **phronesis** in public administration. It also foregrounds **teleology**. Choosing among fairness metrics is a choice among ends and institutional goods, something theology cannot abdicate to engineers. Kearns’s program clarifies that there is no neutrality in metric choice, which generates an invitation for **natural law** and **Scripture** to specify the ends that justify one constraint rather than another.

#### 5. Interlocutors, debates, and philosophical scaffolding
Kearns’s immediate technical interlocutors include **Cynthia Dwork** on **differential privacy**, which since 2006 has set a gold standard for formal protection against inference attacks, and **Jon Kleinberg** on **fairness** trade-offs and socio-technical systems. Within the policy sphere, the normative atmosphere reflects **Rawlsian** concerns for the **basic structure** of society and the priority of certain liberties, as well as **utilitarian** sensitivity to welfare trade-offs operationalized as loss functions. The discourse also touches **Habermasian** elements of public reason, given the emphasis on norms justifiable to diverse agents. These influences give Kearns’s proposals their civic legitimacy and mathematical bite. They also supply a foil for theology, which must ask whether liberal proceduralism is sufficient and whether goods like **truth**, **beauty**, and **worship** bear any straightforward formalization.

Several debates mark the terrain. One concerns **explainability** versus accuracy, where formal **interpretability** may trade off against predictive power. Another concerns **individual fairness** versus **group fairness**, with the former seeking similar treatment for similar individuals and the latter seeking parity of error rates across protected classes. A third concerns **strategic behavior**, foregrounded in work on **strategic classification**, where individuals game the scoring rule, raising questions of **virtue** and **formation** beyond constraint-enforcement. These debates sharpen theological instincts about **law and gospel**. Law-like constraints can curb evils, yet they do not by themselves form just persons. For that, traditions of **virtue** and **sanctification** matter, and Kearns’s constraints can at best secure the civic space where such formation can occur.

#### 6. Institutional design, civic vocation, and moral pedagogy
The strongest constructive import of Kearns for theology is institutional. By insisting on **by-design** guarantees, he recasts the task of **public ethics** as a vocation of builders rather than mere critics. This overlaps with Protestant emphases on **vocation** and **civic righteousness**. Implementing **differential privacy** in census data or healthcare records is a form of neighbor-love that does not await perfect virtue but acts now through architecture. Embedding **fairness constraints** in hiring or lending algorithms can prune patterns of historic exclusion, even while larger questions of reparative justice remain. Using **multicalibration** and feedback-aware designs checks runaway **performative effects**, thereby protecting the weak from the spirals of automated punishment.

The church’s teaching task also benefits. Pastors and educators can catechize with examples drawn from **algorithmic governance**, showing how **law** restrains and how **grace** perfects. Privacy practices in pastoral care mirror **differential privacy** intuitions about harm, while admonitions against partiality resonate with the choice of **equal opportunity** versus **calibration** as fit for context. The **lex Dei** sanctifies these civic analogues by rooting them in the character of God, yet Kearns supplies a tractable toolkit for technologists who share civic ground but not confessional commitments. This is a concrete instance of *lex naturalis* operating within the **two kingdoms** without collapsing their distinction.

#### 7. Limits of formalism and the need for thicker accounts
Kearns’s project is most vulnerable where **formalism** meets the thick textures of moral life. Metrics occlude goods that resist quantification, such as **truthfulness** in testimony, **trust** in institutions, or the formative power of practices over time. The choice of a fairness metric is never merely technical, as Kearns himself concedes by urging context-sensitive selection. But the grammar of constraints can tempt institutions into **proceduralism** that mistakes compliance for justice. The algorithm with **equalized odds** may still demean the poor if the entire system serves exploitative ends. Similarly, privacy constraints may coexist with surveillance capitalism that treats persons as manipulable bundles of preferences rather than bearers of **imago Dei**. There is also the danger of **technocracy**, where experts monopolize norm selection by controlling the formal vocabulary. These are not refutations of Kearns’s thesis but reminders that constraints secure floors, not teloi.

Another limit concerns **accountability** and **authority**. Formal guarantees do not determine who governs models, how grievances are heard, or how repentance operates when harms occur. Theology insists on **office**, **discipline**, and **reconciliation** within communities, categories only partially mappable to audit trails or differential privacy budgets. Likewise, the **eschatological** horizon that animates Christian hope cannot be immanentized into any achievable metric. The most generous reading of Kearns sees him as a craftsman of **penultimate** goods, which are nonetheless crucial under **providence** for protecting the vulnerable within time’s limits.

#### 8. Continuing influence and constructive potential
Since **The Ethical Algorithm** 2019, Kearns’s public essays and ongoing research with **Aaron Roth** and others have continued to sharpen the interfaces between **policy**, **machine learning**, and **civic design**. The maturation of **regulatory frameworks** in Europe and North America has absorbed many of these insights, whether in privacy by design mandates or the demand for **algorithmic impact assessments**. Theologically, this induces a curricular shift. Courses in **moral theology** and **public ethics** now benefit from literacy in **fairness constraints**, **privacy budgets**, and **mechanism design**, not as capitulations to technocracy but as competences for **neighbor-love** in technologically mediated polities. Seminaries and Christian universities can train a cadre of bilingual practitioners who speak both **Scripture** and **statistics**, both **natural law** and **loss function**, with care for the poor and a suspicion of power.

The constructive potential is twofold. First, Christian thinkers can augment Kearns’s constraints with **virtue ethics**, supplying the formative accounts that metrics cannot encode. Second, they can embed constraints within designs that respect **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, distributing authority so that families, churches, markets, and states each exercise their God-given offices without overreach. The combined result would be a technology of **stewardship**, where systems are answerable to moral communities and teloi larger than prediction and control.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Kearns’s program is a welcome instance of **common grace** ordering the civic sphere under **providence**, yet it needs conversion by **revelation-regulated ethics** to avoid procedural reductionism. Positively, his insistence on by-design guarantees aligns with **lex Dei** as protective of the weak, echoes **natural law** prudence that specifies universal goods like justice and truth, and advances a doctrine of **secondary causes** that honors institutional craft as genuine means in God’s governance. His recognition of **impossibility trade-offs** comports with a sober **hamartiology** and the tragic structure of life east of Eden, requiring **prudence** rather than utopianism. Critically, his formalism cannot by itself specify ends. The choice among fairness metrics is a choice among goods and must be normed by **covenantal** purposes revealed in Scripture regarding the poor, truth, and the sanctity of persons made in **imago Dei**. A WTS-like antithesis warns against claims of neutrality in data and models given the **noetic effects of sin** and the idolatrous pull of **technocracy**, while two-kingdoms wisdom cautions churches not to absolutize any metric as gospel. The better path is principled appropriation: employ **differential privacy**, **fairness constraints**, and **mechanism design** as penultimate instruments, while submitting their goals to the **law of God**, ordering their governance by **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, and situating their use within a **teleology** of neighbor-love, truth-telling, and Sabbath-shaped limits that no constraint language can exhaust.
