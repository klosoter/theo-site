### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Bryan D. Estelle stands within the contemporary **Reformed** renaissance of **biblical theology**, a stream flowing from **Geerhardus Vos** through **Meredith Kline** into the ecosystem of **Westminster Seminary California**. Trained in **Semitic philology** and **ancient Near Eastern** backgrounds and ordained for ministry in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, Estelle inhabits the dual world of academy and church. His formation marries **grammatico-historical exegesis** to a confessional **law and gospel** framework, while expanding the exegetical toolset with **intertextuality**, **typology**, and comparative **ANE treaty** analysis. This synthesis yields a characteristic method: read the canon forward with **redemptive-historical** sensitivity and backward with warranted **echoes** that respect authorial intent and the unity of **inspiration**.

The intellectual setting is the post-Klinean emphasis on **covenant structure**, **intrusion ethics**, and **republication of the covenant of works** at Sinai, as well as the broader academic turn to **intertextuality** associated with **Richard B. Hays** and the canonical program of **Brevard Childs**. Estelle adopts the strengths of these movements while resisting relativizing **reader-response** approaches. He prefers the classical **analogia fidei**, guarding **typology** with confessional boundaries and testing **echoes** by textual measurables. The resulting approach is both ancient and modern: ancient in its use of *rîb* lawsuit forms and **suzerain-vassal treaty** patterns, modern in its careful alignment with **Second Temple** hermeneutics and **Septuagintal** trajectories that surface in **New Testament** citations.

Estelle’s scholarly vocation is thus defined by two intertwined projects. First, mapping the **exodus motif** as a canonical through-line culminating in Christ’s **new exodus**. Second, clarifying the **Mosaic covenant** in relation to **creation**, **fall**, and **redemption**, especially through the lens of **Galatians 3** and the **Levitical** life-by-doing formula. Taken together, these projects reveal a theologian convinced that the Bible’s macro-architecture is covenantal and that its load-bearing beam is exodus.

#### 2. Echoes as controlled intertext: criteria and convictions
Estelle’s interpretive conviction is that **intertextual echoes** are not literary accidents but covenantal signals embedded by the Divine Author and human authors to guide the Church into the **mystery of Christ**. Drawing from **Richard Hays’s** criteria for detecting **echoes** availability, volume, recurrence, thematic coherence, historical plausibility, and reception history he adapts them to a confessional context. For Estelle, **availability** demands demonstrable textual contact through **Hebrew** or **Greek** lexemes; **volume** includes verbal repetition, syntactic resonance, and distinctive **motif bundles**; **thematic coherence** is measured against the **covenant storyline**; and **history of interpretation** matters when the **early church** and **Reformation** register the same signal.

Methodologically, these criteria are embedded in **grammatico-historical** exegesis, not opposed to it. Estelle insists that **canonical intertextuality** is disciplined by **authorial intent** and the **analogia Scripturae**. That conviction tempers enthusiasm for free association, avoids collapsing **type** into mere **allegory**, and safeguards the concrete **history of redemption**. His approach is in deep sympathy with **G. K. Beale** on tracing **Old Testament in the New**, yet Estelle keeps the focus on one master plotline: the **exodus** as the paradigmatic act of salvation that structures **prophecy**, **wisdom**, **psalmody**, and the **Gospels**.

#### 3. Echoes of Exodus 2018: the master motif and its reach
In **Echoes of Exodus: Tracing a Biblical Motif** 2018, Estelle aims to demonstrate that the **exodus motif** is both pervasive and architectonic. He argues that the initial deliverance from Egypt in **Exodus 1–15**, the **wilderness** testing, the **Sinai** constitution, and the **conquest** together form a template replicated across Israel’s history and then intensified in **Christ**. The book traverses **Pentateuch**, **Prophets**, **Psalms**, and **Apocalyptic**, then moves to **Gospels** and **Epistles**, showing how exodus language and imagery function as a hermeneutical lens for the canon. The argument is text-rich. He highlights, for instance, **Hosea 11** and **Jeremiah 31** as programmatic for a **new exodus**, **Isaiah 40–55** as the consolation announcing a second deliverance, and **Psalm 77** as a liturgical recollection that shapes communal identity.

In the **New Testament**, Estelle foregrounds **Matthew 2** where the flight to Egypt and the citation of **Hosea 11:1** identify Jesus with corporate Israel, **Mark 1** where the wilderness temptation repeats the **wilderness** probation, **Luke 9:31** where the Transfiguration names Jesus’ impending death as an *exodos*, and **1 Corinthians 10** where Paul reads the **Red Sea** as a kind of **baptism** and manna as **spiritual food** culminating in the **Lord’s Supper**. Revelation’s cycles of **plagues** and the **sea of glass** echo the **Exodus** story as the Church passes through tribulation to victory. For Estelle the **sacraments** are the ecclesial concretions of the **new exodus**. **Baptism** re-enacts passage through the waters and **Eucharist** transforms **Passover** into the messianic banquet. Here his **biblical theology** nests comfortably within **Reformed sacramentology**, where *signa* participate typologically in the res of Christ.

#### 4. Jonah 2005: salvation through judgment and mission to the nations
Estelle’s **Salvation through Judgment and Mercy: The Gospel According to Jonah** 2005 is a focused case study in **biblical theology** and pastoral application. He reads **Jonah** as a narrative microcosm of the **exodus** shape of grace: mercy arrives through the dark tunnel of judgment. The prophet’s descent into the waters and the three days in the fish prefigure the **death and resurrection** pattern, aligning with Jesus’s own appeal to the **sign of Jonah** in **Matthew 12**. The pagan sailors and the city of **Nineveh** anticipate the **Gentile inclusion**, underlining a missional horizon consistent with **Abrahamic** promises and the **exodus** goal of a priestly people for the nations.

Theologically, Estelle highlights the tension of **divine sovereignty** and human repentance, the scandal of **mercy** to enemies, and the danger of a nationalist construal of **election**. The book’s leitmotif **salvation through judgment** mirrors the sea crossing where Egypt’s judgment is Israel’s deliverance and reaches its apex at the cross where the **curse** becomes the **blessing**. Again Estelle’s hermeneutic leans on carefully controlled **typology**, where the narrative’s concrete history does not dissolve into moralism but discloses the **gospel** as the engine of mission.

#### 5. Sinai and republication 2009: law, gospel, and the Mosaic economy
As co-editor and contributor to **The Law is Not of Faith: Essays on Works and Grace in the Mosaic Covenant** 2009, Estelle advances a controversial yet carefully hedged claim about the **Mosaic covenant**. Building on **Meredith Kline**, he argues that **Sinai** republishes the **covenant of works** at the level of Israel’s typological kingdom, specifically in terms of **land tenure**, **national blessing**, and **curse**. The exegetical nerve centers are **Leviticus 18:5** the man who does them shall live by them and **Galatians 3:12** the law is not of faith. Estelle contends that these texts articulate a **works principle** governing Israel’s theocratic existence without undermining the ordo salutis of **grace alone** for individual salvation before God.

The ANE angle proves pivotal. Estelle reads **Deuteronomy** against **suzerain-vassal treaty** structures and **curse lists** analogous to the **Esarhaddon** materials to argue that Israel’s corporate life is legally conditioned, temporally delimited, and typologically freighted. **Blessings and curses** in **Deuteronomy 28–30** function as covenant **sanctions** whose outworking in **exile** is a covenant lawsuit, a *rîb*, anticipating a **new exodus** restoration. He adopts **intrusion ethics** to explain holy war and curse phenomena as forward intrusions of final judgment into the old covenant economy. This grant-inheritance frame allows Estelle to safeguard the **covenant of grace** as the exclusive ground of forgiveness while preserving Paul’s sharp **law and gospel** dialectic.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates: unity and distinction in covenant theology
Estelle’s covenant thesis invites engagement with classic **Reformed** interlocutors. Against **John Murray**, who emphasized the Mosaic’s identity as an administration of the **covenant of grace** without a discrete works principle, Estelle argues for a dual-layered structure where a typological **works principle** governs corporate theocratic life while **grace** remains the only way of eternal life since **Genesis 3:15**. He also interacts with **O. Palmer Robertson**, who frames the Mosaic within a single, unfolding **covenant of grace** that is pedagogical rather than works-based at any level. Estelle’s rejoinder appeals to **Galatians 3** and **Romans 10:5**, reading **Leviticus 18:5** not as a hypothetical or pedagogical device only but as a real covenantal principle at the typological stratum.

Criticism has come from Reformed voices concerned that the **republication** thesis risks compromising the unity of the **covenant of grace** or introducing a merit schema in tension with **federal theology**. Estelle responds by insisting on discrete levels of discourse: typological **merit** for corporate, temporal blessings does not encroach upon soteriological **mercy** for eternal life. Ecclesially, the debate culminated, in part, in the **PCA 2016 report on republication**, which judged certain republication formulations as compatible with the **Westminster Standards** when carefully defined. Estelle’s position fits within that permitted bandwidth, though it remains a live point of intra-confessional refinement, particularly over the exegesis of **Leviticus 18:5** and the nature of **obedience** relative to **faith**.

#### 7. Canonical synthesis: exodus, sacraments, and ecclesial identity
The payoff of Estelle’s **exodus** project is not merely academic synthesis but ecclesial identity. The Church’s life is exilic and pilgrim-shaped, a people passing through wilderness to rest, fed by **Word and sacrament**. His reading of **1 Corinthians 10** aligns with **Reformed sacramentology** where **baptism** signifies union with the crucified and risen Christ and **Eucharist** communicates participation in the **new covenant** Passover. This sacramental **typology** sharpens the ethical horizon: sanctification is not ethical self-improvement but **covenant loyalty** in a desert of testing, empowered by the **Spirit** who brings the **age to come** into the present. Here Estelle’s **intrusion ethics** offers a pastoral realism about suffering and holiness as foretastes of eschatological realities.

Liturgically, the **Psalms** become a school of exodus memory, and the **Prophets** a map of hope. **Isaiah’s** highway in the wilderness, **Jeremiah’s** new covenant, and **Ezekiel’s** restored temple are, for Estelle, not free-floating symbols but coordinates that locate the Church’s polity under the cruciform kingship of Jesus. The missionary thrust of **Jonah** and the **Abrahamic** telos of blessing the nations converge, such that the Church’s hospitality and witness are framed by **salvation through judgment**. The exodus, in this telling, reconfigures ecclesial imagination and pastoral practice as much as it illumines exegetical puzzles.

#### 8. Philology, ANE, and the canon: tools and constraints
Estelle’s commitment to **philology** and **ANE** comparison is instrumental but bounded. He leverages **treaty forms**, **curse sequences**, and **lexical clusters** to clarify the **Mosaic covenant**, yet he resists allowing ANE parallels to dictate biblical meaning. The canon is self-interpreting under the **analogia Scripturae**; **ANE** background is ancillary and illuminative. This disciplined use of background studies reflects his Reformed conviction that Scripture’s unity is theological, rooted in **divine authorship**, and that the **canon’s final form** bears interpretive priority as argued by **Brevard Childs**. His exegesis shows how **Septuagintal** renderings shape **New Testament** usage, particularly where the term *exodos* and **Isaianic** comfort texts are woven into **Gospel** prologues.

The payoff is a hermeneutic that honors textual detail while tracing canonical arcs. Estelle’s work thus inhabits the same orbit as **G. K. Beale** in his emphasis on the **Temple** and **new creation**, yet Estelle privileges **exodus** as the central motif that gathers other themes. His approach yields a coherent account of **prophetic eschatology**, the logic of **exile and return**, and the sacramental shape of **Christian worship**.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage point, Estelle’s contributions are substantial. His exposition of the **exodus motif** offers an elegant, text-driven account of the canon’s unity, strengthening **preaching**, **catechesis**, and **sacramental** understanding. His careful deployment of **intertextual criteria** guards against speculative typology and exemplifies confessional **biblical theology** in the line of **Vos** and **Kline**. On the **Mosaic covenant**, his defense of a qualified **republication** gives conceptual clarity to Paul’s **law and gospel** dialectic and illumines the covenantal logic of **exile**. Nevertheless, tensions remain. The insistence on a real **works principle** at Sinai, even when limited to typological land-tenure, risks flattening the pedagogical function of the law as articulated by classic **covenant of grace** expositors and may be heard as bifurcating the one **Abrahamic** promise in its Mosaic administration. An alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy would accent stronger continuity, reading **Leviticus 18:5** chiefly as describing the life-pattern of faith within the **covenant of grace**, while still acknowledging a sharpened legal pedagogy and covenant **sanctions** that drive to Christ. Hermeneutically, his intertextual method is exemplary but should remain tethered to the **analogia fidei** so that canonical echoes do not outpace clear doctrinal loci. Overall, Estelle represents a faithful, creative extension of **Reformed biblical theology**, and his work serves the Church by uniting the **gospel of grace** with the **exodus** architecture of Scripture.
