### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Dale Tuggy emerges within the late-twentieth and early twenty-first century **analytic philosophy of religion**, a period marked by the rehabilitation of classically theological topics by figures like **Alvin Plantinga** and **Richard Swinburne**, and by the maturation of **analytic theology** as a disciplinary bridge to dogmatics. Trained as a philosopher and teaching for years at **SUNY Fredonia**, Tuggy brings a distinctively **common-sense realism** to questions of **Trinity** and **Christology**, insisting on the governing force of the **classical logic of identity** and on a scruple against positing what he regards as contradictions masked as mysteries. He is best known not only through monographs and articles but also through the **trinities podcast** and blog, a long-running forum curating debate across confessional lines. His self-description as advocating **unitarian Christian theology** centers the claim that the one God of Scripture is numerically identical to the **Father**, with **Jesus** as the unique **Messiah** and agent of God, a stance contrasting both **Latin trinitarianism** and **social trinitarianism** as well as **relative identity** strategies.

Tuggy’s methodological posture is deliberately modest: he prioritizes **Scripture** read with ordinary semantic tools, highlights the early church’s doctrinal development toward **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon**, and treats conciliar formulas as historically situated proposals rather than as sources of theological meaning. He treats metaphysical theorizing as legitimate only insofar as it clarifies rather than legislates doctrine, and he wields **parsimony** and coherence as regulative ideals. In place of an appeal to the **analogia fidei** or to **sacra doctrina** as an internally governed science, he advances a program of conceptual clarification using **identity**, **composition**, and **modal** notions familiar from analytic metaphysics.

#### 2. Taxonomy-builder and polemicist: mapping trinitarian options
A signal contribution of Tuggy’s work is his detailed taxonomy of **trinitarian theories**. Across articles and especially in the **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Trinity** entry first published in 2016 and periodically revised through 2022, he distinguishes **Latin trinitarianism** that starts from one simple divine essence and identifies the persons as **subsistent relations**, **social trinitarianism** that posits three divine selves in a perfect unity of love and will, and **relative identity trinitarianism** that attempts to relax the classical logic of identity so that the **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit** can be the same God yet not the same person. He engages **Brian Leftow** as an exemplar of Latin models, **Richard Swinburne** and **William Hasker** as social trinitarians, and **Peter van Inwagen** along with **Jeffrey Brower and Michael Rea** as proponents of relative-identity or constitution approaches. Against each, his project is to show that a clear, contradiction-free account either collapses into **tri-theism** or **modalism**, or concedes the unintelligibility that **mysterianism** treats as pious virtue.

In the concise monograph **What is the Trinity? Thinking About the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit** from 2017, Tuggy brings this taxonomy to a wider audience, articulating the contrast between **one-self** and **three-self** conceptions of God. He treats the familiar trinitarian creeds as ambiguous on this crucial point, arguing that many popular expositions are in effect **three-self** theologies, which he reads as inconsistent with **biblical monotheism**. The book distills years of debate hosted on the **trinities podcast** and extends an invitation to consider **unitarian Christian theology** as both parsimonious and exegetically satisfying.

#### 3. Unitarian Christian theology: the core thesis
The doctrinal center of Tuggy’s system is the proposition that in the New Testament the **one God** is unambiguously the **Father**. He presses texts like **John 17:3** where Jesus names the Father as the only true God, and **1 Corinthians 8:6**, which he reads as establishing a two-term confession: one God, the Father, from whom are all things, and one Lord, Jesus the Messiah, through whom are all things. On this reading, **theos** in its unqualified, personal use denotes the Father, while **kyrios** functions as a royal title for the risen and exalted man Jesus. This is not merely semantic bookkeeping; it is a thin metaphysics of **one self** who is God and another self who is the human Messiah, united not by **homoousios** but by unique appointment, empowerment, and agency.

Central in Tuggy’s account is the ancient Jewish and early Christian practice of **authorized agency** or *shaliach*, whereby the agent functions with the sender’s authority and may receive language and honor that, in context, accrue to the principal. He uses this to explain New Testament patterns of prayer and worship directed to the Father through the Son, and to dissolve inferences from divine titles or attributions to an identity of nature. The upshot is a robust **monotheism** without **incarnation** in the Chalcedonian sense, and a high **Christology of function** rather than of ontology. The **Holy Spirit** is treated as God’s own spirit and power rather than as a third coequal and coeternal **hypostasis**.

#### 4. Logic, identity, and the critique of trinitarian models
If Tuggy’s exegesis anchors the positive side of his program, his polemical strength lies in the surgical deployment of the **classical logic of identity** against rival accounts. He argues that if each of the **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit** is numerically identical to the one God, then by the indiscernibility of identicals each is numerically identical to the other, which yields contradiction when paired with conciliar denials that the persons are identical to each other. This forces defenders into **relative identity** moves that deny the absolute character of identity, or into model-building where a single divine nature is shared by three centers of consciousness, thus veering toward **tri-theism**. He treats **mysterianism**, associated with some readings of **Peter van Inwagen** and pastoral appeals to ineffability, as a refusal to state a clear thesis, masking inconsistency behind apophatic rhetoric.

His criticism of **relative identity trinitarianism** is particularly sharp. He contends that relative identity theories, which propose that two things can be the same God without being the same person, either collapse into ambiguity about counting or violate intuitive and formal principles of identity that underwrite ordinary and scientific reasoning. Against **Brower and Rea’s** constitution view, where the persons are related to the divine nature as persons to a single concrete substance, he argues that the category of **material constitution** lacks any obvious application to the immaterial, simple God posited by **classical theism**. In all cases, the **parsimony** of unitarianism is presented as an explanatory virtue: one self who is God explains worship, providence, and revelation without proliferating entities or rupturing logic.

#### 5. Scripture and the disputed texts: logos, status, and agency
Tuggy’s exegetical strategy addresses the standard cruxes in **Christology**. In **John 1**, he reads the **logos** not as a preexistent person but as God’s word, wisdom, or self-expression, which becomes flesh when God brings the man Jesus into being, so that the **incarnation** is not the descent of a divine person but the embodiment of divine self-disclosure. In **Philippians 2**, he construes Jesus’s being in the *morphe theou* as the possession of divine status or prerogatives by appointment, and the *kenosis* as a refusal to seize royal privilege rather than a metaphysical self-emptying by a divine person. In **Colossians 1**, he urges that titles like **firstborn of all creation** are primacy-titles, not ontological claims about preexistence, and that cosmological language can be covenantal or eschatological rather than metaphysical.

On key single-verse debates such as **John 20:28** or the **Granville Sharp** constructions in Titus 2:13 and 2 Peter 1:1, Tuggy argues for translation possibilities that avoid identifying Jesus as **theos** in the strict personal sense, or he invokes the flexibility of **theos** in a representative or honorific sense. Throughout, the claim is not that any one text is decisive in isolation, but that a coherent **biblical pattern** emerges when God is consistently identified with the **Father** and when Jesus’s unique sonship and lordship are read through **agency** rather than **ontology**. The upshot is a **humanitarian unitarianism** that typically denies personal preexistence for Jesus, while affirming his virginal conception, sinlessness, messianic mission, death, resurrection, and exaltation.

#### 6. Historical judgments: development and discontinuity
Historically, Tuggy frames **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** dogmas as post-biblical and as responses to philosophical and ecclesial pressures rather than as straightforward exegesis. He highlights **subordinationist** currents among ante-Nicene writers, the contested introduction of **homoousios** at **Nicaea 325**, the semantic instability of **ousia** and **hypostasis** across the fourth century, and the metaphysical density of **pro-Nicene** syntheses that presuppose **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**. He contends that the **Trinity** as doctrine is not manifest in the New Testament and only gradually emerges under the combined force of anti-heretical polemics and conceptual borrowings from **Middle Platonism**.

This judgment informs his ecclesial posture. Tuggy treats creeds as historically valuable but theologically revisable; he reads **Sola Scriptura** as a methodological manifesto that authorizes re-examination of long-settled formulas. He distinguishes his view from **Arianism** by denying a preexistent divine being subordinate to the Father and from **modalism** by affirming the distinct selfhoods of the Father and the Son. By contrast with **Jehovahs Witnesses** or non-Christian unitarians, he stresses allegiance to the risen Lord Jesus and a soteriology centered on his atoning death and resurrection, but without the metaphysical apparatus of **two natures**.

#### 7. Public argument and ecumenical debate
Tuggy is not a cloistered academic. The **trinities podcast** since 2012 has hosted conversations with analytic philosophers and theologians across the spectrum, including robust exchanges with **Swinburne**, **Hasker**, **Leftow**, and with pastors and apologists such as **James White** and **Michael Brown**. These engagements sharpen his rhetorical contrast between **clear doctrines** and **incoherent mysteries**, and they display his commitment to charitable but unflinching criticism. He often frames debates around simple inference-schemes, pressing interlocutors to specify whether God is a **self** and whether Jesus is the **same self** as God or a **different self**, thereby forcing a choice among **three-self trinitarianism**, **one-self trinitarianism** that risks **modalism**, or **unitarianism**.

His broader scholarly footprint includes the **Stanford Encyclopedia** entry that has become the default map of options in analytic discussions of the **Trinity**, shaping how graduate seminars and dissertations articulate the space of positions. Together with the accessible **What is the Trinity?** and a stream of essays and debates, this has normalized **unitarian Christian theology** as a live option within analytic theology, even among those who reject it. The appeal is methodological as much as doctrinal: if the rule of faith is rational transparency constrained by **Scripture**, then **parsimony** and **coherence** commend unitarianism as serious Christian philosophy.

#### 8. Systematic center and practical stakes
At the system level, Tuggy’s theology subordinates **metaphysics** to **exegesis** and locates the **gospel** in God’s action through the human Jesus, the second Adam and anointed son. The **Father** remains the fons deitatis in a strong sense, not by eternal generation but because he alone is the **uncreated source**. The **Son** is mediator without **consubstantiality**; the **Spirit** is divine presence without **hypostatic personality**. This alignment yields a liturgical pattern of prayer to the **Father**, in the name of the **Son**, by the **Spirit** as God’s activity. It promises simplicity for catechesis and apologetics: rather than explaining **processions**, **missions**, and **inseparable operations**, the believer confesses one God, the Father, and one Lord, Jesus the Messiah.

Philosophically, the approach underscores the intelligibility of **divine action** by a single agent and treats appeals to **mystery** as concessions to contradiction. It urges that the church’s witness gains in credibility when her claims can be rendered in ordinary language without metaphysical innovation. The cost is clear: relinquishing **homoousios**, **eternal generation**, and the **hypostatic union** as classically construed. Yet for Tuggy, that cost is demanded by fidelity to **Scripture** and to the canons of rational discourse.

In a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, however, the proposal misfires at multiple principia. First, its epistemic rule privileges a univocal **logic of identity** over the revealed modes of divine naming governed by **analogy** and **accommodation**, so that what classical Reformed orthodoxy would treat as **mystery without contradiction** is prematurely judged incoherent. Second, its biblical method isolates texts from the **canonical** and **covenantal** pattern wherein the one **YHWH** executes **inseparable operations** ad extra through the **Word** and **Spirit**, and where New Testament doxology and worship of the **Lamb** presuppose **homoousios** even when not lexicalized. Third, by denying the **eternal generation** and **autotheos of the Son** as confessed by **Calvin** and codified at **Westminster**, it undercuts the Reformed grammar of **redemption** in which only a consubstantial Son can reveal the Father and accomplish covenantal mediation without idolatry. A Reformed alternative insists that revelation, not metaphysical austerity, is principial; that **divine simplicity** and **Trinity** coinhere in pro-Nicene exegesis; and that **mystery** names the finite knower’s posture before the triune Lord rather than a cloak for contradiction. On these grounds, Tuggy’s **unitarian Christian theology** is judged a coherent but theologically deficient reconstruction, eclipsing the triune fullness of grace and the covenantal economy by which the **Father**, **through the Son**, in the **Spirit**, saves.
