### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Robert W. Jenson emerged as a preeminent **Lutheran** dogmatician whose career tracks the late twentieth-century **Trinitarian revival** and the postliberal critique of modern theology. Born in 1930 and dying in 2017, he was formed within American **Lutheran** institutions and the German university milieu shaped by the retrieval of **Karl Barth** and debates over **historicized metaphysics**. Early study of **Barth** culminated in the monograph **Alpha and Omega: A Study in the Theology of Karl Barth** 1963, followed by **God After God** 1969, where Jenson probed the eclipse of the living **biblical God** in modernity and the need for an eschatological grammar. Teaching at St. Olaf College and the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettysburg, and later serving at the Center of Theological Inquiry in Princeton, he helped to found with **Carl E. Braaten** the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and the journal **Pro Ecclesia** in 1992, signposting an ecumenically catholic **dogmatics** oriented by **creed**, **canon**, and **liturgy**.

Jenson’s methodological axiom is that **dogmatic theology** must say what must be true if the **gospel about Jesus** is true. In **Story and Promise** 1973 he sharpened a **narrative ontology** in which the **gospel** does not merely report facts but identifies God by promise. The divine name is given by the story: God is the one who brought Israel from Egypt and raised Jesus from the dead. This yields a method that is simultaneously **postliberal** and metaphysical: the **canonical narrative** and **creedal rule** bind theological grammar, yet they demand ontological specification of **Trinity**, **time**, and **church**. Jenson therefore rejects both reductive **historicist hermeneutics** and a-historical **substance metaphysics**, proposing instead an **event metaphysics** in which God’s being is the **triune discourse** whose temporal shape is determined by the **eschaton**.

Within this frame Jenson mobilizes **Rahner’s Rule** — the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity — not as a dissolving of theological ontology into history but as a directive that the identity of the **immanent triune God** is the selfsame identity enacted in the **economy**. He argues that divine **eternity** is not timeless stasis but **temporal eternity** — God’s life as the fullness of time, the future that grounds all futures. The corollary is a revisionist deployment of **immutability** and **impassibility** in light of the **paschal mystery**, now integrated into the **perichoretic** life of Father, Son, and Spirit. The culmination of this method is the two-volume **Systematic Theology** 1997–1999, which offers a compact, liturgically textured **trinitarian metaphysics** and an ecclesial ontology in dialogue with **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, **Luther**, and **Barth**.

#### 2. Major works and the trinitarian turn
Jenson’s early writings on **Barth** established the key concern: how can the **God of the gospel** be asserted as living, present, and lord over time. **Alpha and Omega** 1963 portrays **Barth’s** doctrine of God as the attempt to say that God is Lord by sheer act. **God After God** 1969 radicalizes the claim by arguing that modern theology has evacuated the biblical God into an idea, and that the God of **promise** must be recovered as the one whose identity is eschatological. **Story and Promise** 1973 popularized the thesis that the **gospel** is not primarily an explanation but an eventful word that makes a people and a future. The medium-sized **The Triune Identity** 1982 offered a concentrated statement: the **Trinity** is the grammar of the gospel, and the name of God is a narrative name. Co-editing the two-volume **Christian Dogmatics** 1984 with **Braaten**, Jenson coordinated a cadre of theologians across **evangelical catholic** lines. The mature summa in **Systematic Theology** 1997–1999 then embedded everything within a synchronized vision of **Trinity**, **creation**, **church**, and **eschaton**, with later distillations in **Canon and Creed** 2010 and **A Theology in Outline** 2016 that pressed his case for the inseparability of **Scripture** and **creed** in a sacramental ecclesial form.

At the heart of this project stands a thesis about **the Trinity** and **time**. Jenson famously states that God is whoever raised Jesus from the dead and, before that, brought Israel out of Egypt. This is not mere description but identification: the divine **name** is an eventful narrative. God’s being is the **perichoretic** conversation of Father addressing the Son in the Spirit, a conversation whose temporal field is **eternity as future**. Eternity is thus not a fourth dimension but the divine life as the inexhaustible future of all temporal histories. The **Father** is the font of this future, the **Son** is the dramatic center as the incarnate **homoousios** with the Father, and the **Spirit** is the personal eschatological presence speeding the church into the Kingdom. Against a timeless **immutability**, Jenson speaks of the constancy of God’s fidelity; against a brittle **impassibility**, he speaks of the triune capacity to include the history of **Jesus’ cross** within divine life.

#### 3. Christology, salvation, and the identification of God
Jenson’s **Christology** is dogmatically maximalist and explicitly **Lutheran** in its use of the **communicatio idiomatum**. Because the **economic** identity is the **immanent** identity, to say that Jesus is Lord entails that the **Son’s** history — birth from **Mary**, ministry, cross, and resurrection — is constitutive of who God is for us and in himself. The **two-natures** doctrine articulates not the cohabitation of a divine nature with a human nature, but the personal identity of the one **Son** whose human story is God’s own self-specification. On the cross God does not merely permit suffering to a human partner; the **triune God** takes up and transfigures that history within the eternal **perichoresis**. The resurrection is the decisive eschatological victory that grants the church its time and performs the promise.

Soteriologically, Jenson’s accent falls on **participation** and **dramatic victory** rather than on a quasi-forensic transaction alone. He does not deny juridical motifs, but the center is the **gospel as promise** that creates a people who live toward the **eschaton**. Through the **Spirit**, believers participate in the risen **Christ’s** time; this participation has the character of **theosis** as adopted into the triune communion. Faith is not assent to timeless truths but reception of the promise that makes one a member of the community whose **Eucharist** is the foretaste of the feast to come. Throughout, Jenson also insists on the irreducible role of **Israel** in the identity of the **God** who in Jesus fulfills his promises. To detach **church** from **Israel** would be to risk inventing a different deity than the one narrated by **Scripture**.

#### 4. Scripture, canon, creed, and ecclesial form
Jenson’s ecclesiology pivots on **Canon and Creed** 2010, where he argues that **Scripture** is the church’s canon only as received within the **creedal** and **liturgical** life that actually forms a people. The **canon** is not a detachable list of texts but the normative field of apostolic testimony authorizing the **church’s** proclamation. The **creed** crystallizes the narrative rule by which the texts are read; the **liturgy** is the performative space where the triune **name** is invoked and God identifies himself as the living Lord of his people. This is a robust **Eucharistic ecclesiology**: at the Lord’s Table the **Spirit** makes Christ present to gather and extend the one body across time, so that the church’s very temporality is measured by the risen **Christ**. The ministry has an eschatological service of unity; episcopal and presbyteral forms are not mere pragmatic arrangements but ordered to catholic visibility.

Ecumenically, Jenson’s **evangelical catholic** posture took shape with **Carl Braaten** in initiatives and dialogues that sought rapprochement with **Roman Catholic** and **Orthodox** churches. The use of **icons**, the retrieval of **fathers**, and the insistence on **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** dogma mark his commitments. He criticizes Protestant biblicism that abstracts **Scripture** from **creed** and depreciates sacramentality, and he criticizes Roman centralism when it constricts evangelical freedom. The center throughout is the **triune name** confessed in baptism and enacted in the **Eucharist**, yielding an ecclesial ontology in which the church is the social body whose identity is sustained by the **Spirit** as pledge of God’s promised future.

#### 5. Creation, providence, and the charge of historicism
In **Systematic Theology** vol. 2 Jenson articulates **creation** as the roomy field in which the triune **God** gives time and space to others. Creation ex nihilo signals that God’s decision to be God with creatures is utterly free; there is no metaphysical need driving divine self-communication. Yet in a bold move, Jenson also claims that God has freely chosen to have his identity be this story with **Israel** and **Jesus**, such that the **end** — the **eschaton** — determines the beginning. The arrow of time is shaped by promise; **providence** is not a chain of efficient causes but the Spirit’s keeping of creatures within the trajectory of the **Kingdom**. Nature is not a neutral realm but a sacramentally open field, a **sacramental ontology** in which realities are apt for communion.

Critics charge that this amounts to **Hegelian historicism**, locating God’s identity within temporal process and endangering **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and the **Creator-creature distinction**. Jenson replies that eternity as **temporal infinity** secures rather than dissolves divine freedom, since God’s future is the inexhaustible plenitude in which times find their place. He denies the **analogia entis** as a natural bridge to God; instead he urges that **analogy** is evangelical, arising from the **Word** and **sacrament** whereby the church is taught how to speak. He rebuffs **process theology** by insisting that God’s being is his triune **act** rather than a participation in a larger metaphysical process. The result is an uncommonly integrated vision where **creation** and **eschatology** define one another within the **Trinity**.

#### 6. Time, eternity, and the identity of the Triune God
Few proposals are more distinctive than Jenson’s recasting of **divine eternity** as **temporal eternity**. Drawing on **Augustine’s** account of time yet pressing beyond it, and learning from **Pannenberg** and **Moltmann** on **eschatology**, Jenson contends that eternity is not the negation of time but its divine fulfillment. The **Father** is the source who gives the future; the **Son** is the concrete historical center whose Easter presence is the church’s time; the **Spirit** is the arrival of the future that assures that history has direction. The **immanent Trinity** is not a timeless diagram but the living God whose identity is identical with the story narrated by **Scripture** and confessed in **creed**.

This revision forces clarification of **immutability** and **impassibility**. For Jenson, God’s **immutability** is not immobility but unfailing fidelity to his **promise**; God’s **impassibility** is not incapacity to suffer but the divine power to include suffering without being overcome by it. The **passio** of the **Son** becomes a personal event within the triune life by the love of the **Father** and the **Spirit**. The **perichoretic** unity is the metaphysical ground that permits strong language such as the **death of God** in Jesus without dissolving the **Trinity**. Here his engagement with **Jüngel** and **Moltmann** is evident, even as he resists reducing the **Trinity** to a theodicy.

#### 7. Scripture, reason, and the catholic rule of faith
Though aligned with the **Yale School** in valuing **Lindbeck’s** and **Frei’s** attention to canon and communal language, Jenson resists a merely intratextual account of truth. For him, **Scripture** and **creed** obligate **metaphysics**; to confess **homoousios** and **perichoresis** is already to speak ontologically. Thus **Canon and Creed** 2010 argues that the **rule of faith** is no external imposition but the form in which the **Spirit** preserves the apostolic gospel. The **church’s** liturgical use of the **canonical Scriptures** is therefore the ordinary site of God’s self-identification. Reason is rehabilitated as the church’s disciplined contemplation of the **Trinity** through the ordered symbols of **sacrament** and **doxology**. Here Jenson finds allies in **Augustine** and **Aquinas** even as he modifies classical **divine simplicity** by subordinating it to **trinitarian relations** and narrative identity.

The hermeneutical upshot is a catechetical-sapiential theology. The **psalms**, **gospels**, and **epistles** are not mere historical deposits but the Spirit’s instrument to draw the church into Christ’s **resurrection** time. Exegesis is thus ecclesial, doctrinal, and doxological, which motivates Jenson’s impatience with academic methods that sever **biblical theology** from **dogmatics**. The **center** is always the living **Christ** addressed by the **Father** and present by the **Spirit**.

#### 8. Eschatology and judgment
Eschatology, for Jenson, is not an appendix but the horizon of all **doctrine**. The **resurrection** of Jesus is the proleptic arrival of the **Kingdom** within time. The **Spirit** enacts this prolepsis as ecclesial life ordered by **Word** and **Eucharist**; the **sacraments** are not dispensable aids but constitutive media of the future’s arrival. Hope is therefore not optimism but participation in the **triune** future. On judgment and **hell**, Jenson insists on the seriousness of divine wrath and the real possibility of exclusion from communion, yet he frames judgment within God’s relentless **promise** to be God-with-us. While wary of dogmatic **universalism**, he commends a hope that refuses to posit any corner of creation as finally outside the reach of the **Spirit’s** eschatological work.

The consummation is described as communal **theosis**: the saints will share in the **Son’s** relation to the **Father** by the **Spirit**, a participation already begun in baptismal identity and Eucharistic union. The cosmos itself is drawn into this **perichoretic** peace. Here again Jenson’s **sacramental ontology** and **narrative ontology** meet: the final truth of things is a liturgical communion scripted by the **gospel**. The drama ends not in abstraction but in the triune life whose **Name** the church has confessed.

#### 9. Interlocutors, debates, and influence
Jenson’s career is interwoven with dialogue and debate among giants. From **Barth** he learns the primacy of **revelation** and the dogmatic discipline of **Christocentrism**. With **Pannenberg** he shares an **eschatological** bent and a preference for history as the locus of God’s self-disclosure, though Jenson resists historicism by identifying eternity as **future** rather than as historical totality. With **Moltmann** and **Jüngel** he explores the cruciform **Trinity**, yet he seeks to guard the **perichoretic** unity and to locate divine suffering within the triune plenitude rather than within a divine need. He disputes **Rahner** by pressing the identity of **economic** and **immanent** Trinity more strongly, even as he shares Rahner’s anti-extrinsicism. Engaging **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, he appropriates **simplicity** and **analogy** while retooling them to serve a **narrative ontology**. With **Lindbeck** and **Frei**, he retrieves the **canonical** shape of theology, yet he resists quietism by insisting on robust **metaphysics**. Against **process theology**, he asserts divine **aseity** as triune act rather than cosmic dependence.

Institutionally, his leadership with **Braaten** in founding the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and **Pro Ecclesia** shaped a generation of theologians seeking a **Nicene** ressourcement that is evangelical in character. Jenson’s prose, aphoristic and daring, made him a touchstone for debates about **divine temporality**, the prospects of **ecumenism**, and the nature of **dogmatics** in a postliberal age. His influence traverses **Lutheran**, **Reformed**, **Anglican**, and **Catholic** circles, and he is frequently cited by **Radical Orthodoxy** and by theologians attempting to unite **Trinitarian metaphysics** with ecclesial practice.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
A Reformed and WTS-style assessment of Jenson discerns genuine strengths alongside principled cautions. Positively, his **Christocentric trinitarianism**, his linkage of **canon and creed**, his **Eucharistic ecclesiology**, and his insistence that **dogmatics** serve the **gospel** resonate with **Reformed** commitments to the **principium externum** of **Scripture**, the **rule of faith**, and the centrality of **covenant** and **church**. His affirmation that God is known in the **economy** aligns with **Calvin’s** insistence that we know God not in the naked essence but as he accommodates himself in **Word** and **Spirit**. His eschatological emphasis coheres with **Vosian biblical theology** that reads all of Scripture by the **already and not yet** of the **Kingdom**.

Yet significant tensions remain. First, Jenson’s **temporal eternity** and strong reading of **Rahner’s Rule** risk collapsing the **immanent** into the **economic**, endangering **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **aseity** as confessed in classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. The Reformed alternative holds that God is **simple** and immutable *ad intra* while freely temporal in his *opera ad extra*, with the **covenant** economy truly revealing yet not constituting his triune identity. Second, his unqualified assertion that God’s identity is this history could be heard as locating God’s being within the **covenant of grace** rather than grounding the covenant in God’s eternal **decree**, a reversal that strains the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **autotheos** of the **Son**. Third, his **sacramental ontology** and **Eucharistic** metaphysics invite appreciation but call for Reformed specification: the real presence is by **Word and Spirit** rather than by an ontologized liturgy, and the visibility of catholicity must be normed by the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the primacy of **preaching**. Fourth, his critique of **analogia entis** should be paired with a robust **analogical predication** grounded in **Creator-creature** distinction to avoid equivocity. In sum, Reformed dogmatics can receive Jenson’s **narrative ontology** as an economy-facing grammar, while safeguarding the **immanent Trinity** by classical **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**, locating identity in eternal **triune relations** and decree, and letting **covenant** and **eschaton** display — not determine — who the triune **Lord** eternally is.
