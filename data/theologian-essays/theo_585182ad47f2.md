### ESSAY
Scott B. Rae emerges as a leading figure in contemporary **evangelical bioethics** whose central wager is that the **imago Dei** supplies a public moral grammar adequate for complex questions of life, death, and economic life. Formed by the **Dallas Theological Seminary** tradition in biblical authority and the **University of Southern California** training in **social ethics**, he inhabits the late modern space where **biomedical innovation** intersects with contested cultural norms. His long ministry at **Talbot School of Theology, Biola**, along with advisory work in hospital and policy settings, places his ethics at the seam of the academy and the clinic, the classroom and the boardroom. The chronological markers of his career map onto watershed moments in the culture, **Roe v. Wade** in 1973, the **Dolly** cloning breakthrough in 1996, the **Human Genome Project** completion in 2003, the Great Recession of 2008, and recurrent legislative expansions of **physician assisted suicide**, so that his corpus reads as a sustained engagement with late modernity under the lordship of Christ.

Rae’s method is a layered **biblical-worldview** approach that weds **special revelation** to **general revelation**, drawing on *lex naturalis* while maintaining the primacy of Scripture. He is a forthright **moral realist**, insisting that moral properties are objective and grounded in the character of the **triune God**. Within the Protestant discussion of moral conflicts he defends **graded absolutism**, indebted to **Norman Geisler**, arguing that divine norms can be hierarchically ordered so that in genuine conflicts a higher command can permissibly override a lower. He retrieves **casuistry**, *casus conscientiae*, and appropriates **principlism** from **Beauchamp and Childress** while refusing the autonomy maximalism of secular bioethics. Metaphysically, his **substance view of persons** anchors **sanctity of life**, and teleologically he frames moral evaluation according to creation’s *telos* in the narrative arc **creation, fall, redemption, restoration**. The guiding meta-principles are **imago Dei**, **human dignity**, **love of neighbor**, and **justice** for the vulnerable, articulated in a register designed for the **public square**.

A signal achievement is **Moral Choices** 1995, with subsequent editions in 2009, 2018, and 2023, which has become a standard evangelical introduction to **ethics**. Rae constructs a disciplined process for moral deliberation that begins with careful fact gathering, identifies morally relevant features, brings to bear **biblical principles**, weighs consequences without collapsing into **utilitarianism**, considers **virtues** and motives, consults the wise, and acts with integrity under the sovereignty of God. The text models a judicious **plural-method** stance that integrates **deontological norms**, **teleological ends**, and **virtue formation**, while granting primacy to revealed norms. He employs this method across contested issues like **abortion**, **euthanasia**, **reproductive technologies**, **genetic testing and therapy**, **war and peace**, and **sexual ethics**, increasingly addressing late-breaking questions such as **gene editing**, **embryo research**, and **assisted suicide** with attention to both **public policy** and pastoral care.

In **Bioethics: A Christian Approach in a Pluralistic Age** 1999, coauthored with **Paul M. Cox**, Rae explicitly theorizes how evangelical conviction enters plural discourse. The work uses **principlism** as a lingua franca, recasting **autonomy**, **beneficence**, **nonmaleficence**, and **justice** within a **biblical teleology** that foregrounds **imago Dei** and the **common good**. Rae argues for an ontological account of human dignity that resists **functionalist personhood** criteria associated with **Peter Singer** and **John Harris**. He supports the **principle of double effect** to adjudicate hard end-of-life cases and distinguishes **ordinary means** of care, obligatory, from **extraordinary means**, optional when disproportionate to benefit. This yields a clear rejection of **active euthanasia** and most cases of **physician assisted suicide**, while permitting withdrawal of burdensome treatments and favoring robust **palliative care** and hospice, a posture resonant with **Paul Ramsey’s covenantal medicine** and **Gilbert Meilaender’s** attention to finitude.

Rae’s 1994 monograph **The Ethics of Commercial Surrogate Motherhood: Brave New Families?** registers his early, incisive concern about the commodification of procreation and the fragmentation of motherhood. Here **imago Dei** and **covenantal fidelity** function as critical lenses through which he evaluates **surrogacy**, **in vitro fertilization**, and **third-party gamete donation**. He argues that commercialized **surrogacy** warps the moral ecology of procreation, introduces market logic into intimate bonds, and risks exploitation of poorer women. While recognizing the grief of infertility and the goods of marital fruitfulness, Rae urges restraint regarding **IVF** practices that create supernumerary embryos, questions **preimplantation genetic diagnosis** when applied eugenically, rejects **cloning** as an affront to procreative goods, and encourages alternatives like **adoption**, including embryo adoption understood as rescue. He defends only those reproductive interventions that respect the integrity of **marriage**, the dignity of the **child**, and the unity of the procreative and unitive goods.

On the beginning of life Rae defends a robust **sanctity of life** ethic. He contends that personhood begins at conception, because the nascent embryo is a whole **human substance** with the intrinsic capacity to develop toward maturity. Consequently, **abortion** is morally impermissible except in the rarest of cases involving true maternal-fetal lethal conflict, addressed by **double effect** analysis rather than direct fetal killing. He rejects **embryonic stem cell** research that requires embryo destruction while welcoming **adult stem cell** and **induced pluripotent stem cell** technologies as morally praiseworthy. On **genetics** he distinguishes therapeutic **gene therapy** that restores a disordered function from enhancement projects that reengineer human nature. He resists **germline editing** and **designer baby** trajectories that undermine giftedness, echoing **Leon Kass** on the wisdom of repugnance, while remaining open to precisely targeted therapies that heal without instrumentalizing offspring or commodifying traits.

Rae’s parallel stream of scholarship in marketplace ethics displays the same **creation-order realism**. With **Kenman L. Wong** he authored **Beyond Integrity: A Judeo-Christian Approach to Business Ethics** 1996, extensively revised in 2012, and **Business for the Common Good** 2011, advancing a theological vision of work grounded in the **cultural mandate**, **stewardship**, and **neighbor love**. He argues that markets, rightly ordered, can serve the **common good**, reduce poverty, and promote **human flourishing**, while requiring moral formation and institutional constraints. He analyzes **corporate social responsibility**, **fair wages**, **globalization**, **corruption**, and **environmental stewardship**, bringing **Scripture**, **natural law**, and **virtue ethics** to bear on concrete business practices. In **The Virtues of Capitalism** 2010, with **Austin Hill**, Rae makes a guarded moral case for relatively **free markets**, highlighting the virtues of trust, industry, and creativity, and warning against both **greed** and statist overreach, a position he frames as **stewardship under divine sovereignty**.

Pedagogically Rae is a bridge-builder and pastorally sensitive ethicist. His **Introducing Christian Ethics: A Short Guide to Making Moral Choices** 2016 distills the structure of **Moral Choices** for a broader audience, offering a concise workflow for deliberation that can be deployed in congregations, classrooms, and clinics. He has served the wider movement through association with **The Center for Bioethics and Human Dignity**, speaking and consulting in medical ethics committees, and hosting conversations that translate **evangelical ethics** into actionable frameworks. His vocational emphasis on **formation** manifests in attention to **virtues** such as courage and chastity, to ecclesial practices of community discernment, and to catechesis that habituates the people of God for witness in a contested public square. The leitmotif remains the same, **imago Dei** as the nonnegotiable axis for dignity and duty.

Rae’s engagement is dialogical and public-facing. He debates and responds to **utilitarianism** in **Peter Singer**, dissects **principlism** as formulated by **Beauchamp and Childress**, appropriating its insights while resisting its procedural thinness, and resonates at key points with **Leon Kass** on practical wisdom regarding biotechnology’s boundaries. He has learned from **Paul Ramsey** and **Gilbert Meilaender** to frame medicine as covenantal fidelity rather than consumer service, and he interacts with **Oliver O Donnovan** in underscoring how **resurrection** and **creation** inform moral order. Within evangelical circles he aligns with **Norman Geisler** on **graded absolutism**, while he also shows openness to **John Frame’s** triad of **norms**, **situations**, and **virtues** as analytically helpful without diluting moral objectivity. His tone is irenic yet firm, and he labors to offer reasons that can be heard in a **pluralistic democracy** without downplaying confessional depth.

Theologically the unifying center of Rae’s project is a thick **theological anthropology**. Humans are bearers of **imago Dei**, called to cultivate creation, to receive life as gift, and to order economic production toward **shalom**. This anthropology generates principled judgments across domains. In medicine, refuse to treat persons as units of utility and reject technologies that subvert procreation’s **telos**. In business, insist that **profit** be nested within **justice**, authentic **work**, and neighborly responsibility. In law and policy, argue for protections that shield the vulnerable and give space for institutional pluralism. The consistent ecology of concepts, **dignity**, **stewardship**, **common good**, and **virtue**, makes Rae’s corpus unusually coherent among evangelical ethicists, with **Moral Choices** and **Beyond Integrity** functioning as curricular anchors for pastors, clinicians, and executives.

Rae’s abiding contribution is the construction of an evangelical ethic capable of public traction without cost to doctrinal fidelity. He does not reduce Christian moral reasoning to **natural law**, yet he articulates a mode of **public reason** that translates **Scripture’s** claims about the human person into arguments accessible to those outside the church. That translation effort has helped a generation of students, physicians, and business leaders grasp how **creation order** norms bind conscience, why life at its margins requires special care, and how market energy can be pruned by **virtue** and **justice**. The impressive reach of **Moral Choices** and the staying power of **Beyond Integrity** and **Business for the Common Good** testify to Rae’s clarity, prudence, and pastoral heart.

From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage point, Rae’s strengths are significant, especially his appeal to **imago Dei**, his defense of **sanctity of life**, and his retrieval of **creation order** and **virtue** for public discipleship. Three tensions merit calibration. First, **graded absolutism** risks implying disharmony within the **moral law** and threatens the Reformed axiom that God’s commands cohere in the unity of the **Decalogue**. A classic alternative is Reformed **casuistry** grounded in **covenant law**, deploying **double effect**, **circumstance**, and **truth-telling** under the ninth commandment, so that apparent conflicts are resolved without ranking divine norms. Second, the mediation of **natural law** and **public reason** is helpful yet should be chastened by **antithesis** and **covenantal epistemology**, lest common-morality language obscure the noetic effects of sin and the necessity of **special revelation** to rightly order ends. Third, the defense of **market capitalism** is salutary when tethered to **stewardship**, yet Reformed teaching on **sphere sovereignty** and **two-kingdom prudence** counsels stronger critique of finance-driven distortions, labor precarity, and ecological costs. With these recalibrations, Rae’s project can be fruitfully received within **classical Reformed orthodoxy**, strengthening its covenantal grounding while preserving his lucid witness to **human dignity** in medicine and commerce.
