### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The work of **Andrew Root** emerges squarely from the pastoral perplexities of late-modern North American Protestantism, where congregational decline, the collapse of youth ministry models, and the social plausibility crisis analyzed by **Charles Taylor's A Secular Age** converge. Root's home base at **Luther Seminary** situates him in a **Lutheran** doctrinal register that prizes the **theologia crucis**, an account of **grace** operative under the sign of weakness rather than cultural power. The cultural backdrop is Taylor's **immanent frame**, the **age of authenticity**, and the **buffered self**, categories that Root integrates with insights from **Hartmut Rosa** on social **acceleration** and **resonance** to diagnose why standard ecclesial strategies falter. Against managerial technique, he advances an ontology of ministry: Christian ministry is participation in **divine action**, a **Christopraxis** that interrupts the closed circuits of immanence with the advent of the living **Christ**.

Root's method is deliberately **practical-theological**, neither merely pragmatic nor naively confessional. He combines fine-grained, empirically inflected case narratives with dogmatic reasoning about **divine action**, **personhood**, and **time**. His epistemic stance is chastened actualism: God is known where God acts, with the cross as hermeneutical key grounded in **Luther's** distinction of **theologia crucis** over **theologia gloriae**. Root resists both **deistic providence** and a thin **interventionism**, seeking a thick description of **encounter** as event in which persons are addressed and transformed. To sustain this posture, he draws from **Bonhoeffer** on **Stellvertretung** and from the modern tradition of pastoral theology while absorbing Taylor's account of secular social imaginaries.

#### 2. Early development: personhood, place-sharing, and youth ministry
Root first gained prominence with **Revisiting Relational Youth Ministry** (2007) and **Relationships Unfiltered** (2009), where he targets the instrumentalism of relationship-as-technique. He retrieves **Bonhoeffer's Stellvertretung** as **place-sharing**, proposing that ministry with young people is not the cultivation of influence for outcomes but a participation in the **vicarious** self-giving of the **incarnate** Christ. Theologically, this is an anthropology of **personhood** constituted in relation, not an individualism that uses the other for ecclesial success metrics. In **The Children of Divorce** (2010) he extends this relational ontology into family fracture, arguing that the pain of disrupted **covenant** bonds is properly addressed only in ministries that carry the burdens of the other as a concretization of Christ's **substitutionary** solidarity. Across these works the **theology of the cross** governs his critique: ministry that hides from death, loss, and despair is a **theologia gloriae** dressed in evangelical techniques.

Books like **The Promise of Despair** (2010) and **The Theological Turn in Youth Ministry** (2011) articulate Root's call for youth ministry grounded in **dogmatics** rather than sociology alone. He argues that programs enthralled to **therapeutic** or **consumerist** imaginaries misname the gospel, while a ministry that narrates and waits upon **divine action** in Christ dignifies young persons as agents addressed by God. The pastoral implication is that practices like testimony, truthful lament, and shared life are not motivational strategies but sites of **divine presence** disclosed under the cross. This emphasis anticipates his later formalization of **Christopraxis**, where the ontology of ministry is spelled out with greater doctrinal precision.

#### 3. Christopraxis and divine action
In **Christopraxis: A Practical Theology of the Cross** (2014) Root provides his central constructive proposal. There he defines ministry as participation in the action of the living **Jesus Christ**, mediated by the **Holy Spirit**, encountered in concrete history. The accent falls on the actuality of **divine action** as event. Echoing a Barthian-style **actualism** while remaining Lutheran, he argues that God is not a static substance behind events but the One who acts and gives Godself in history. By invoking **Luther's communicatio idiomatum** to name Christ's personal presence, Root contends that Christ's action encompasses human agency without collapsing Creator and creature. The minister's task becomes discerning and bearing witness to this action, a discernment that refuses **mechanistic causality** while also rejecting a **deist** insulation of the world from God.

Methodologically, **Christopraxis** blends narrative case studies with dogmatic claims. Root describes pastoral encounters and then presses toward theological judgments about where and how **Christ** acts. The argument is that ministry's ontology derives from God's act before its techniques, making pastoral action a mode of participation rather than an application of principles. Crucially, he frames this participation within the **theologia crucis**: God acts under the form of the cross, in weakness and in solidarity with suffering, so ministry must be durable enough to wait through apparent divine **absence**. This waiting, a form of faithful **patience**, becomes a recurring virtue across his later work.

#### 4. Bonhoeffer retrieved and the wager on personhood
Root's **Bonhoeffer as Youth Worker** (2014) integrates **Sanctorum Communio**, **Act and Being**, **Discipleship**, and **Life Together** into a coherent vision of youth ministry rooted in ecclesial community. He argues that **Bonhoeffer's** account of the church as Christ existing as community underwrites ministry with youth as participation in the church's **representative** life. The concept of **Stellvertretung** grounds a theologically thick alternative to programmatic activism: ministers carry and are carried by others, enacting the **body of Christ** through mutuality and confession. Against managerial trends, he celebrates practices of **life together** that place the Word, confession of sin, and shared prayer at the center, thereby resisting the **therapeutic** inflation of the self.

The wager here is anthropological: the **person** is not an isolated will but a being constituted in addressedness. Root therefore positions his ecclesiology as the social space where divine address forms persons in **communion**. Combined with the **theology of the cross**, this results in pastoral guidance that privileges shared suffering over spectacle and **vocation** over volunteerism. The care of souls is thereby reimagined as accompaniment that discerns and names **God's action** rather than engineering outcomes. This retrieval establishes the throughline that will frame his engagement with secularity in the coming trilogy.

#### 5. A Secular Age and the redefinition of formation and pastoral identity
With **Faith Formation in a Secular Age** (2017) Root turns explicitly to **Charles Taylor's** analysis of secularity. He argues that contemporary projects of "faith formation" often assume the **age of authenticity** in which selves curate meaning via choice within the **immanent frame**. Churches replicate this by offering techniques for producing religious experience, thereby surrendering to the **buffered self** and rendering God optional. Root counters with a vision of formation as the reception of **divine action**, where the living God addresses and reconstitutes persons through cross-shaped encounter. He criticizes the ecclesial obsession with **youthfulness** as a secular fetish, proposing instead practices that cultivate **patience**, **testimony**, and shared **time** attentive to God's advent.

In **The Pastor in a Secular Age** (2019) he narrates a genealogy of pastoral identity, moving from the **cura animarum** of the shepherd of souls, through the **managerial** and **therapeutic** pastor, to a new proposal: the pastor as witness and articulator of **divine action**. Root employs social history and Taylor's categories to show how pastoral work was colonized by the logics of efficiency and therapy. His constructive alternative calls pastors to name God's presence in the ordinary, to carry communal **cross-pressures**, and to resist the tyranny of immediacy with a cultivated **patience** grounded in God's faithfulness. The throughline is the same: ministry is not work performed for God but participation in God's work for us.

#### 6. Time, acceleration, and congregational life
The argument is deepened in **The Congregation in a Secular Age** (2021), where Root appropriates **Hartmut Rosa's** diagnoses of social **acceleration** and the loss of **resonance** to explain congregational exhaustion. He claims that churches have internalized speed, growth, and innovation as soteriological goods, thereby aligning themselves with secular time rather than **sacred time**. The ecclesial task becomes the cultivation of a temporal ecology in which people can encounter the living God. Root commends practices that slow and thicken time, such as Sabbath-keeping, testimony, and rites that accent the church's shared **kairos** over secular **chronos**. These are not mere traditionalisms; they are strategies of attending to **divine action** by resisting the colonization of time.

This temporal theology aligns with Root's earlier insistence on **patience** as a practical virtue. He casts **resonance** as a kind of receptivity to God's address, which cannot be manufactured by technique. Theologically, this leans on a Lutheran confidence that God binds Godself to the **Word** and acts through promised presence. Sociologically, it is a critique of the productivity paradigm that enthralls many congregations. The wager is that congregations that keep time with God's action will become communities where despair is met by hope, not by strategies for brand revitalization.

#### 7. Telos, decline, and innovation fatigue
Root presses his critique of technique further in **The End of Youth Ministry?** (2020), where he reframes the telos of ministry with adolescents around **joy** understood theologically as participation in the **divine life** rather than entertainment or moral outcomes. He argues that the search for relevance has frequently eclipsed **union with Christ**, so that youth ministry becomes indistinguishable from secular youth development. Joy, for Root, is not a mood but the fruit of encountering the God who acts, particularly in and through the **cross**.

In **Churches and the Crisis of Decline** (2022) and **The Church After Innovation** (2022), followed by **When Church Stops Working** (2023), Root challenges the ecclesial obsession with **innovation**, **entrepreneurship**, and **workism**. He contends that the innovation imperative often smuggles in a soteriology of human work, thereby rendering **grace** functionally unnecessary. Root does not reject creativity; he rejects the metaphysics that makes novelty the condition of ecclesial legitimacy. Using composite narratives as theological case studies, he shows pastors and congregations learning to narrate **God's action**, to wait in hope, and to adopt practices that privilege **presence** over production. The positive proposal is simple and demanding: ground ecclesial life in discerning and witnessing to the living God's action, and let programs be the fruit rather than the engine of ministry.

#### 8. Science, disenchantment, and apologetic patience
A notable strand in Root's corpus engages the sense of disenchantment and the authority of science. In a work like **Exploding Stars, Dead Dinosaurs, and Zombies** (2018), he addresses how an evolutionary and cosmological imaginary shapes the plausibility of faith for emerging adults. Rather than treating science as threat or rival myth, he situates it within Taylor's **immanent frame** while insisting that **divine action** is not reducible to gaps in explanation. He presses for an apologetic patience that testifies to **encounter** with the living God in ordinary life, an encounter discerned under the **theology of the cross** rather than through spectacle. This strand shows that his **Christopraxis** is not ecclesially insular but consciously public, addressing the late-modern school's alternative catechesis.

Across these later works Root's tone is pastoral and diagnostic. He eschews polemic in favor of narrating what it looks like for people to be met by **God**. His chief conceptual tools remain consistent: the **immanent frame** as condition, **divine action** as primary cause, **place-sharing** as pastoral posture, **patience** as temporal virtue, and **joy** as eschatological fruit. The result is a body of practical theology that offers pastors a coherent imagination for ministry without capitulating to the logics of efficiency or nostalgia.

#### 9. Doctrinal profile and theological significance
Doctrinally, Root stands at the intersection of **Luther's theologia crucis**, **Bonhoeffer's Stellvertretung**, and a contemporary account of **divine action** shaped by actualist sensibilities. His ontology of ministry reframes pastoral identity and ecclesial practice in terms of participation rather than production. The stress on **personhood** as addressed in encounter resists both voluntarist and therapeutic reductions. His ecclesiology of **sacred time** challenges congregations to re-inhabit practices that facilitate **resonance** with God's presence. Even his engagement with **science** is subordinated to the claim that God acts and is to be found precisely where modernity least expects: in the ordinary, in suffering, and in the church's shared life. These moves render Root a major voice in contemporary **practical theology**, especially where youth ministry, pastoral identity, and congregational change are concerned.

Root's theological method is also exemplary for its fusion of narrative and dogmatics. The use of thick case descriptions to make judgments about **divine action** echoes earlier practical theologians yet stands out for its doctrinal density. The repeated retrieval of **grace** over **work**, of **presence** over technique, and of **patience** over speed constitutes a coherent spiritual theology for late modernity. While he draws on **Taylor** and **Rosa**, his commitments are decisively theological, directing readers to watch for the living **Christ** rather than for cultural leverage or intellectual escape hatches.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
A Reformed and Westminster-leaning evaluation will gratefully affirm Root's emphasis on **divine initiative**, the critique of **instrumentalism**, and the retrieval of a cross-shaped **ontology of ministry**. His vision resonates with classic Reformed commitments to God's sovereign **providence**, the primacy of **grace**, and the church's need to resist cultural **autonomy** in the **immanent frame**. Yet tensions appear. First, the event-language of **divine action** risks obscuring the instituted objectivity of **Word and sacrament** as the ordinary sites of God's saving presence. A Reformed alternative insists that the Spirit's action is covenantally promised in the ministry of the **Word**, **Baptism**, and the **Lord's Supper**, not simply in narratively discerned encounters. Second, Root's actualist register can blur the distinction between **common** and **special grace**, tempting a flattening of **providence** into every meaningful resonance. Reformed theology would tie pastoral discernment to the canon of **Scripture**, the **covenant of grace**, and the **ordinary means** as the norming loci of encounter, while still welcoming providential consolations in ordinary time. Third, while Root's critique of **innovation** is salutary, a covenantal account of history and vocation can articulate faithful institutional reform without capitulating to workism, drawing on **Sabbath** and **two-kingdoms** insights to order sacred and common time. In short, Root helpfully diagnoses the malaise of technique and accelerative time, but a Westminster trajectory would anchor his **Christopraxis** more explicitly in the administered means of grace, regulated by **Scripture** and covenant, thereby safeguarding assurance and sustaining mission within late-modern cross-pressures.
