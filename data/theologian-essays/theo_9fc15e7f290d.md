### ESSAY
Oliver O'Donovan stands as a leading contemporary voice in **Anglican moral and political theology**, renowned for the thesis that the **resurrection of Jesus Christ** is the decisive disclosure of the **created moral order** and the authorization of **public authority** under divine **judgment**. Formed by the intellectual milieu of **Oxford** and ordained within the **Church of England**, he held the **Regius Chair of Moral and Pastoral Theology** at Oxford for over two decades and later served as Professor of **Christian Ethics** at **Edinburgh**. His work emerged in debates that pitted **Kantian deontology** and **utilitarian consequentialism** against contemporary **virtue ethics**, while Anglican theology negotiated the decline of **Christendom** and the rise of late-modern **liberalism**. Against these currents, O'Donovan develops a **Christological moral realism** that retrieves **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, reframes **natural law** as eschatologically disclosed, and insists that **authority**, *auctoritas*, is not the sovereignty of will but the public manifestation of the **good** vindicated in the **resurrection**.

The methodological pivot came early. In **The Problem of Self-Love in St. Augustine**, 1979, O'Donovan absorbed and refined **Augustine's** *ordo amoris*, the ordering of love by the **love of God**, **amor Dei**, rather than by **self-love**, **amor sui**. This Augustinian trope becomes the ethical grammar of his later work. In **Begotten or Made?**, 1984, addressing **bioethics**, he contrasts the **gift** of procreation with the **manufacture** of persons, anchoring sexuality and procreation within a **created order** rather than technological choice. These early studies already display O'Donovan's characteristic moves: scriptural exegesis joined to **patristic ressourcement**, a rejection of voluntarist **moral constructivism**, and confidence that the **order of creation** is revealed and healed in Christ. The result is neither a secular **naturalism** nor an isolated **divine command** theory, but a Christologically renewed *lex naturae* that binds **conscience** to the **truth** of created goods.

The mature statement of this method appears in **Resurrection and Moral Order**, 1986, perhaps O'Donovan's most influential book in **Christian ethics**. The thesis is stark: by raising Jesus from the dead, God vindicates not only the **Son** but also the **created order** that finds its *telos* in him. The **resurrection** is epistemic as well as soteriological, since it discloses the **authority of the good** and calls human **agency** to responsive **obedience**. O'Donovan reworks the moral law as teleological rather than voluntarist, retrieving **Aquinas's** account of **practical reason** and **virtue** but refusing to isolate it from **eschatology**. Creation and redemption are one ordered economy, *una dispensatio*, in which the **moral order** is not an autonomous platform but a gift recognized through **faith's** clear sight of the risen Lord. This generates a distinctive vocabulary of **freedom as acknowledgement**, **authority as reality's claim**, and **action as participation** in the given order. It also repudiates the bid for neutrality that underwrites **liberal proceduralism**, since the moral life is already addressed by the **gospel**.

If **Resurrection and Moral Order** established the metaphysical and moral foundation, **The Desire of the Nations**, 1996, extends the thesis into **political theology**. O'Donovan argues that the **gospel of the kingdom** has generated and transformed the West's political concepts of **authority**, **representation**, **law**, and **peoplehood**. The messianic rule of **Christ** reframes the **state** as a temporal **representation** of judgment, not an eschatological kingdom. He retrieves **Israel's** political grammar, the **Davidic** pattern, and traces how New Testament proclamation redefines **kingship**, **priesthood**, and **prophecy** as forms of public service under Christ's lordship. The bold and controversial claim is that the heritage of **Christendom** was a historically intelligible attempt to coordinate the **Church** and the **regnum** under the one **lordship** of Christ. Though he refuses nostalgia, he resists the late-modern assumption that **secularity** is the neutral default. The nations' desire, echoing **Isaiah**, is ordered to the **judgment** already revealed in the **resurrection**, which confers a public vocation on the Church to witness and on rulers to judge.

The constructive politics of judgment are then labored in **The Ways of Judgment**, 2005. Here O'Donovan formulates an account of **political authority** as a form of **judgment** rendered on the common world, *res publica*, in the face of concrete evils and competing goods. He clarifies distinctions between **authority** and **power**, between **legislation** and **adjudication**, and between **emergency** action and ordinary **rule of law**. The work extends his doctrine of **representation**, linking political office to a delegated **responsibility** to make decisions in the name of the community, held accountable to the **good** discerned in created reality. The structure is Augustinian, with careful attention to **peace**, **order**, and the mixed nature of civic life this side of the **eschaton**. The political vocation is bounded and non-salvific, yet genuinely public under **divine providence**. In this register O'Donovan refutes both **pacifism** that denies politics its tragic burden and **realism** that denies politics its moral **normativity**.

A complementary strand is O'Donovan's defense of the **just war** tradition in **The Just War Revisited**, 2003. He interprets *ius ad bellum* and *ius in bello* as concretizations of **love of neighbor** and **public responsibility**. War remains a lamentable instrument of **judgment**, with stringent criteria of **authority**, **cause**, and **proportionality**, tethered to the goal of **peace**. Against both humanitarian militarism and principled pacifism, O'Donovan insists that **political ethics** must treat the use of force as morally assessable within a renewed **natural law**. This is of a piece with his broader account of **authority** as answerable office and **judgment** as service to the common good.

The later **Ethics as Theology** trilogy gathers and reframes these themes for moral agents in act. **Self, World, and Time**, 2013, considers personal **agency** under the horizon of **creation** and **eschatology**, teaching that to act is to take time seriously before God. **Finding and Seeking**, 2014, explores **practical reason**, attention, and deliberation as modes of **truthfulness** in action, binding **intention** to the reality of goods already there. **Entering into Rest**, 2017, concludes with **Sabbath**, **worship**, and the consummation of action in **rest**, echoing **Augustine's** program that our hearts are restless until they rest in God. The trilogy integrates **virtue**, **law**, and **grace** under the banner of **resurrection**, offering neither a bare casuistry nor a narrative ethic, but a theological phenomenology of action that is answerable to the **Word** and alert to the **Church's** disciplines.

Historically minded readers will note O'Donovan's joint work with **Joan Lockwood O'Donovan**, **From Irenaeus to Grotius**, 1999, a monumental sourcebook that demonstrates the breadth of **Christian political thought** across patristic, medieval, and early modern traditions. The editorial introductions model his method of **retrieval** and critical reception, showing how **Aquinas**, **Hooker**, **Calvin**, **Vitoria**, and **Grotius** wrestled with *ius*, *lex*, **authority**, and **sovereignty**. This historical labor underwrites O'Donovan's confidence that contemporary **political theology** need not capitulate to modern **secularism** nor retreat into sectarian **ecclesiocentrism**. The past affords conceptual tools, especially **natural law** and **representation**, that become intelligible when reconceived under **Christ's** present rule.

Throughout, O'Donovan conducts searching dialogues with major interlocutors. Against **Barthian** suspicions of **natural theology**, he recasts **natural law** as **revelation's** corollary rather than its competitor, a knowledge of created goods that is confirmed by the **resurrection** and disciplined by the **gospel**. Against **Rawlsian** neutrality, he exposes the fiction of a disembedded **public reason** and argues for a candidly **theological politics** capable of common speech. Against **MacIntyre**, he appreciates the recovery of **virtue** but resists any communitarian closure that would deny the **public** scope of truth. Against **Yoder** and **Hauerwas**, he applauds the witness of the **Church** yet insists that **political authority** is not an alien intrusion but a divine calling in a fallen world. These engagements display a consistent pattern: a refusal of coercive **voluntarism**, a refusal of liberal **proceduralism**, and an insistence that **authority** is the claim of the **good** upon free agents under **judgment**.

The practical edge of O'Donovan's ethics is visible in contested fields. In **Begotten or Made?**, he articulated constraints on **reproductive technologies**, distinguishing **procreation** as participatory reception of life from the **manufacture** of persons as products. In **A Conversation Waiting to Begin**, 2009, he urged the **Church** to retrieve chastity, marriage, and **sexual ethics** governed by **creation** and **resurrection**, while refusing the reduction of persons to identities framed by modern **desire** politics. In ecclesial politics, he defended the **freedom of the Church** under Christ against both **state** interference and ecclesial **clericalism**, recommending forms of **synodality** and **episcopal** responsibility accountable to the **gospel** and the common good. His guidance is concrete without lapsing into managerial technique, because it remains tethered to **authority** understood as the manifestation of the **good** in public action.

Methodologically, two signatures govern O'Donovan's project. First is the insistence on the **objectivity of the good**, a created **order** that is prior to our choices and to which **practical reason** must be converted. This is not a metaphysical abstraction but a Christologically illuminated realism that hears the **Word**, attends to **creation**, and acts in **hope**. Second is the controlling theme of **judgment**, which binds together **ethics**, **politics**, and **eschatology**. Judgment is not mere condemnation but the divine **recognition** and setting-right of realities in the **resurrection** of **Jesus**, which authorizes human acts of **recognition** and **adjudication** in law, warfare, and governance. These signatures explain why **authority** and **representation** are focal: they are the institutional forms by which the **good** claims us in common life.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. O'Donovan's **resurrection-grounded moral order** aligns with classical **Reformed** affirmations that **creation** and **redemption** form one divine economy and that **natural law** has real moral significance under **Scripture**. His Augustinian **ordo amoris**, his stress on **providence**, and his realistic **just war** account resonate with **Calvin's** teaching on **civil magistracy** and **Turretin's** use of natural reason. Yet important tensions persist. First, on **epistemology**, his confidence in **public reason** recognizing the **good** may underplay the **noetic effects of sin**, where a WTS lineage shaped by **Van Til** would stress an antithesis that requires more overt **presuppositional** appeal to **special revelation**. Second, on **political theology**, his qualified retrieval of **Christendom** and strong doctrine of **representation** sit uneasily beside Reformed two-kingdoms accounts and **Kuyperian sphere sovereignty**, which parse the **church's spiritual mission** and the **magistrate's** charge under distinct **covenantal** administrations, especially the **Noahic** for civil order. Third, on **natural law**, his eschatological recasting is salutary, but a Reformed alternative would more explicitly subordinate natural-law reasoning to the **covenant of grace** and the **analogia fidei**, while protecting principled **pluralism** in a fallen age. The Reformed corrective would therefore accentuate redemptive-historical **exegesis**, insist on the **sufficiency of Scripture** to norm moral knowledge, and deploy **common grace** to explain shared judgments without conceding any neutral **public square**. Within these adjustments, O'Donovan remains a rich ally for a covenantally thick, **Christologically** centered account of **authority**, **law**, and **judgment**.
