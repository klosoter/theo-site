### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Max Turner emerged within the **British evangelical** academy as a New Testament theologian committed to **biblical theology** and the renewal of **Pentecostal-charismatic** life in the churches. Teaching at the **London School of Theology** through the 1980s and 1990s, he worked at the intersection of **historical-grammatical exegesis**, **Second Temple Jewish backgrounds**, and the lived questions of **charismatic gifts** arising from the global renewal. Turners discipline is careful: the **Lukan narrative** is allowed to be its own theological voice, while maintaining that Luke and Paul contribute complementary trajectories within a unified canon shaped by the **analogia fidei**. His method accents intertextual links between **Isaiah’s Spirit of the Servant**, **Joel’s outpoured Spirit**, and the restoration hopes of **Qumran** so that Luke-Acts can be read as **Heilsgeschichte**, an eschatological narrative of **Israel’s restoration** culminating in mission to the nations. The leitmotif of **prophetic empowerment for witness** is not extracted from isolated proof texts but traced across **Luke-Acts** as a narrative-theological pattern, supported by lexical attention to *pneuma*, *dynamis*, and *martyria*.

Turners early essays in the **Tyndale Bulletin** of the 1980s contested the dominance of **James D. G. Dunn’s** 1970 thesis in **Baptism in the Holy Spirit**, which had collapsed **conversion-initiation** and **Spirit-gift** into a single soteriological event. Against this, Turner argued that Luke employs **Spirit language** with a distinctive register that foregrounds **prophetic inspiration** and **missional power** rather than conversion per se. In a scholarly ecosystem that included **I. Howard Marshall’s** mediations and the emerging **Pentecostal** biblico-theological tradition of **Roger Stronstad** and **Robert Menzies**, Turner positioned himself as a mediating yet critical voice, loyal to **evangelical hermeneutics** while open to the **continuation** of the **charismata**.

#### 2. Programmatic works and overarching thesis
The publication of **Power from on High: The Spirit in Israel’s Restoration and Witness in Luke-Acts** in 1996 crystallized Turners thesis that Luke’s pneumatology is fundamentally **prophetic and restorative**. The titular phrase from **Luke 24.49** becomes a hermeneutical key: the promised **power from on high** is the messianic gift of the **Spirit** that both fulfills **Isaiah** and **Joel** and inaugurates the church’s **witness** to the risen Lord. Also in 1996, and revised in 2005, **The Holy Spirit and Spiritual Gifts: Then and Now** extended this biblical-theological foundation into a constructive ecclesiology, assessing the **charismata** across the New Testament with a sustained sensitivity to their **contemporary use** in the church. Where **Power from on High** is exegetically dense, the later volume is a pastoral-theological synthesis: Turner contends for robust **continuationism** while resisting **dogmatic initial-evidence** claims and uncritical **experientialism**.

In both books, Turner’s central claim is coherent and ambitious: in **Luke-Acts** the **Spirit** functions primarily as the gift of **prophetic empowerment for witness**, tied to **Israel’s eschatological restoration**, which yields a pattern of **Spirit reception** that is frequently, though not necessarily, **subsequent** to conversion. The corollary is that Luke’s pattern carries **normative force** for the church’s **mission**, even if the exact sequence or manifestations such as **tongues** cannot be universalized. This is not reductionist soteriology but **missionary ecclesiology**, with the **Spirit** as the praxis-shaped presence of the risen Christ.

#### 3. The Lukan narrative: restoration and witness
Turner’s careful reading of **Luke 1–4** highlights that the **Spirit** engenders a renewed **prophetic community**. The **Spirit** fills **Zechariah**, **Elizabeth**, and **Simeon**, anticipates **Joel 2**, and climaxes in **Jesus’** *Spiritus Prophetiae* at **Luke 4**, where **Isaiah 61** becomes a programmatic charter: good news to the poor, release to the captives, the year of the Lord’s favor. Here the **Spirit Christology** is not a diminution of Christ’s divinity but a construal of the **economic Trinity** *ad extra*, in which the **Son** as the **Spirit-anointed Servant** inaugurates the **kingdom** through **Spirit-empowered proclamation**. This sets the pattern for **Acts**, where the **ascended Christ** pours out the **Spirit** as **Pentecost** signals the **restoration of Israel** in **Acts 2**, shaped by **Joel 2**, **Psalm 16**, and **Psalm 110**.

In **Acts**, Turner argues, **Spirit reception** is regularly coordinated with **witness** and **prophecy**. The **Jerusalem** outpouring yields **glossolalia** and **prophetic doxology** that interpret the mighty works of God. The **Samaritan** episode in **Acts 8** displays **subsequence** under apostolic mediation, while **Cornelius** in **Acts 10–11** shows a near-simultaneous pattern that nonetheless dramatizes inclusion. The **Ephesian** disciples in **Acts 19** experience **Spirit reception** with **tongues and prophecy**, echoing **Pentecost**. Against monolithic readings, Turner shows Luke’s **theological flexibility**: subsequence often occurs because the narrative is about **mission expansion** and **apostolic recognition**, not because Luke is constructing a rigid order of salvation. The core is **prophetic empowerment for mission**, so that **witness**, **prayer**, **bold speech**, and **charismatic guidance** punctuate Acts 1–28 as Spirit-birthed practices of the **restored people of God**.

#### 4. Luke and Paul in canonical conversation
Turner rejects both **Dunn’s conflation** of Luke’s **Spirit** with Pauline **conversion-initiation** and simplistic **Pentecostal harmonizations** that impose Luke’s paradigms everywhere. Instead, he proposes a **dual-profile** held together canonically. For **Paul**, especially in **Romans 8** and **1 Corinthians 12–14**, the **Spirit** is the sphere of new creation life, adoption, and giftedness, integrating **soteriology**, **ethics**, and **charisms**. For **Luke**, the **Spirit** is foregrounded as **missionary power** and **prophetic speech**. The result is a complementary theology: **one Spirit**, multiple **economies of discourse**. This **Luke-Paul differentiation** allows Turner to affirm real **subsequence** in Luke without creating a two-stage **ordo salutis**, because the canon presents **multifaceted pneumatology** oriented to both **new life** and **mission**.

By maintaining this **canonical pluriformity**, Turner is able to answer the critique that **Pentecostal theology** imposes a rigid pattern. He does so by establishing theological forms rather than prescriptive sequences: Luke’s **Spirit baptism** is normatively about the church’s **witness**, while Paul frames the same **Spirit** in terms of **incorporation into Christ**. The canon thus yields a more capacious **pneumatological anthropology** and **ecclesiology**, integrating **mission** and **sanctification** without collapsing them.

#### 5. Spirit Christology and Trinitarian economy
A significant strand in Turner’s work is **Spirit Christology**. He reads the **baptism of Jesus**, the **wilderness testing**, and the **Nazareth sermon** as the decisive **anointing** and **authorization** of the incarnate **Son** by the **Spirit** for his messianic mission. This yields a **Trinitarian economy** where the **Father** sends the **Son**, who ministered in the **Spirit’s power**, and who in exaltation becomes **the Lord of the Spirit** who pours out **Pentecost**. In this pattern, the **Spirit** is not an impersonal force but the personal **ruach/pneuma** who mediates **divine presence**, authorizes **prophetic speech**, and constitutes the church as **eschatological temple**.

Turner’s **Spirit Christology** safeguards **homoousian** Christology while offering a biblical-theological account of **kenosis** understood not as divestment of deity but as **role-relational dependence** upon the **Spirit**. That dependence is exemplary for disciples, who receive the same **Spirit** for **witness** and **obedience**. This provides the theological ground for **charismatic ministry** as participation in the **mission of the Son** by the **power of the Spirit**.

#### 6. Spiritual gifts then and now
With **The Holy Spirit and Spiritual Gifts: Then and Now** Turner crosses from pure exegesis to constructive discernment of **charismata** in the contemporary church. He surveys **1 Corinthians 12–14**, **Romans 12**, **Ephesians 4**, and **1 Peter 4** to argue that gifts are **diversified ministries** given for **edification** and **mission**, that **prophecy** should be exercised with **discernment**, and that **tongues** is valuable but neither universal nor a necessary **initial evidence**. He critiques **cessationism** as exegetically thin and historically reactive, while also warning **charismatics** against a manipulative **pragmatics** that reduces the **Spirit** to technique. His plea is for **ordered openness**, where **Scripture** regulates practice, **discernment** tests spirits, and **love** is the measure of **power**.

Key to Turner’s pastoral-theological posture is the claim that the **Lukan pattern** retains **normativity** without uniformity. Churches should expect **prophetic speech**, **healings**, and **guidance** as ordinary expressions of **kingdom ministry**, yet avoid absolutizing any one manifestation or sequence. The **Spirit** remains free, the **Word** remains supreme, and the church remains a **charismatic community** ordered to **mission**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
Turner’s work is situated amid vigorous debate with **James D. G. Dunn**, **Gordon Fee**, **Roger Stronstad**, and **Robert Menzies**. Against **Dunn**, Turner maintains that **Luke** really does present **Spirit reception** with a functional orientation to **power for witness** that is not reducible to **conversion**. Against certain **classical Pentecostal** iterations, he rejects the necessity of **initial evidence of tongues**, arguing that **Acts** presents multiple signs and that the **gift** is broader **prophecy** and **bold speech**. With **Gordon Fee**, who emphasizes **God’s empowering presence** across the Pauline corpus, Turner agrees on **continuationism** and **charismatic ecclesiology**, but he preserves a sharper **Luke-Paul distinction** than Fee’s integrative tendency. With **Stronstad** and **Menzies**, Turner shares a **Lukan prophetic** emphasis, yet he often moderates their stronger claims about subsequence and normativity.

A second arena of debate is hermeneutical. Turner resists both **proof-texted pragmatism** and **demythologizing historicism**. His appeal to **Second Temple** literature is not mere background but a theological grammar that clarifies how **Luke** frames the **Spirit** as the agent of **restoration**. By re-situating **Pentecost** within **Isaiah 32, 44**, and **Joel 2**, Turner argues that **Acts** is the field manual of a restored **prophetic people** whose vocation is **martyria** to the ends of the earth.

#### 8. Doctrinal development and ecclesial implications
Turner’s contribution deepens **Pentecostal theology** by shifting the question from **how do I receive more** to **for what mission does the Spirit empower the church**. Theologically, the **Spirit** is the agent of **mission**, the **church** is the locus of **prophetic witness**, and the **gifts** are ministries calibrated for **edification** in the service of **evangelization** and **justice**. This has implications for **spiritual formation**: prayer and fasting in **Acts 13**, communal discernment in **Acts 15**, and bold speech amid suffering in **Acts 4** become normative practices of a **Spirit-shaped habitus**. It also recalibrates **sacramental theology** insofar as **baptism**, **laying on of hands**, and **table fellowship** are viewed as vehicles through which the **Spirit** forms a missionary people under the **apostolic word**.

Doctrinally, Turner sustains both **Trinitarian orthodoxy** and **charismatic practice**, showing that **Spirit Christology** strengthens rather than weakens **Chalcedonian** confession. Ecclesially, his work supports a **missional ecclesiology** where leadership is **charismatically diversified** and **Scripture** orders the exercise of **power** by **love**. The **normativity** of **Lukan empowerment** calls churches to expect **Spirit-given speech** and **courage** in proclamation and to seek **integrity** and **holiness** as inseparable from **power**.

#### 9. Strengths, limits, and legacy
The signal strength of Turner’s corpus is its integrated **biblical-theological** reading of **Luke-Acts** that clarifies **prophetic empowerment for mission** without falling into sectarian dogmatism. He makes the **Pentecostal** case academically respectable by setting it on **intertextual** and **narrative** grounds. He retrains practitioners to prioritize **witness** and **edification** rather than techniques of **power**. His **Spirit Christology** invites renewed preaching of **Jesus’** Spirit-anointed work and the church’s participation therein. In dialogue with **Dunn** and **Fee**, he has carved out a canonical synthesis that many evangelicals and charismatics can inhabit.

Limitations remain. Some critics argue that Turner risks overstating **Luke’s normativity** for contemporary **ecclesial practice**, and others judge his **subsequence** claims underdetermined. His mediating stance can seem caught between **classical Pentecostal** expectations and **evangelical** caution, leaving readers wanting stronger **dogmatic** framing. Yet his legacy is durable: pastors and scholars now speak more confidently of **prophetic empowerment** and **missionary ecclesiology**, citing **Power from on High** and the accessible **The Holy Spirit and Spiritual Gifts: Then and Now** as key guides for a theologically literate continuationism.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** standpoint, Turner’s emphasis on **redemptive-historical mission** resonates with **biblical theology** and the **covenantal** narrative of **promise-fulfillment**. His **Luke-Paul differentiation** helps avoid flattening the canon, and his rejection of **initial-evidence dogma** aligns with a classical **sufficiency of Scripture** posture. Nevertheless, Reformed concerns arise at three points. First, the suggestion of **subsequence** in Luke, even as functional and non-soteriological, can be misread pastorally as a **two-tier spirituality**, which conflicts with **union with Christ** as the singular fountain of every **spiritual blessing**. A Reformed alternative would frame Luke’s **empowerments** as episodic **fillings** governed by **Christ’s lordship** in the **covenant of grace**, not as a second blessing pattern. Second, the move from Lukan description to **normativity** requires tighter **hermeneutical warrants**. The **regulative principle** demands that practices be clearly warranted by **Word** and tethered to the **means of grace**; thus, prophecy and tongues must be exercised in subordination to **preaching and sacraments** and tested by strict **discernment**. Third, Turners **Spirit Christology**, though commendable, would benefit from clearer **doctrinal dogmatics** regarding **divine simplicity** and the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity, lest role relations be construed as functional separations. In sum, Reformed theology can appropriate Turner’s **prophetic empowerment for mission** while recasting subsequence as **occasional filling**, rooting all gifts in **union with Christ**, and ordering charismatic practice under the **Word-regulated** covenantal life of the church.
