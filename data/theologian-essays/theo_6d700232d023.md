### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and conversion
Richard John Neuhaus, born 1936 and died 2009, traversed the American religious landscape from **Missouri Synod Lutheran** pastor to **Roman Catholic** priest, mapping a career across **civil rights**, **Vietnam-era protest**, and the later **culture wars**. A founding leader of **Clergy and Laity Concerned** against the Vietnam War and an ally of **Martin Luther King Jr.**, Neuhaus initially drew from **Reinhold Niebuhr** and Christian realism, aiming to bring **public theology** to the American city. His early Lutheran ministry in Brooklyn, his alliances with **Abraham Joshua Heschel** and labor activism, and his editorial labors with the journal that became **First Things**, positioned him at the crossroads of religion and politics. The decisive turn came with his 1990 reception into the **Roman Catholic Church** and 1991 ordination to the priesthood, an embrace of **magisterial authority**, **sacramental ecclesiology**, and the **natural-law** tradition that would stabilize his earlier social vision within a thicker account of **truth** and **freedom**.

Neuhaus wrote within a specific American horizon of **ordered liberty** and constitutional jurisprudence, arguing that **religious freedom** is not a concession of the state but a recognition of the human person in relation to **truth**. The thematic center of his corpus is the insistence that liberal democracy requires moral contents that it cannot generate by itself. Against what he named the **naked public square**, he contended that the attempted exclusion of religious argument from public life is both historically false and philosophically incoherent. His conversion to **Catholicism** did not change that core conviction, it rather deepened it through **John Courtney Murray's** reading of **Dignitatis Humanae** and **Gaudium et Spes**, the magisterial teaching on **religious liberty** and the **church in the modern world**.

#### 2. Method and theological stance
Neuhaus's method is **public theology** informed by **Catholic natural law** and Augustinian **civitas Dei** and **civitas terrena** motifs. He favored arguments accessible to reason, *lex naturalis* as participation in the eternal law, and the language of the **common good**. Drawing from **Thomas Aquinas**, he treated natural law as an *ordinatio rationis*, an order of reason that belongs to all rational creatures, yet fulfilled by **revelation**, **grace**, and **sacrament**. This choice aligned him with **John Courtney Murray** and the tradition of **subsidiarity** and **solidarity** in **Catholic social teaching**, deploying these as public categories. He preferred to meet secular interlocutors with rational, prudential argument, rather than with appeals to ecclesial authority, even though his later **Catholic** identity framed the content he defended, notably the **sanctity of life**, marital norms, and religious liberty as grounded in the dignity of the person.

The method combined **Augustinian realism** about sin and political limits with a Murray-esque affirmation of the **American experiment** as a project in **ordered liberty** open to truth. Neuhaus argued that liberal democracy cannot survive on proceduralist neutrality, that it requires substantive moral commitments supplied by communities of **religious conviction** and by the grammar of **natural law**. His monthly column, **The Public Square**, became an exercise in rhetorical catechesis, a rolling seminar on the moral epistemology of public life, the dynamics of **civil society**, and the dangers of what he called the judicial usurpation of politics, culminating in the controversial **First Things** symposium, **The End of Democracy**, in 1996.

#### 3. The Naked Public Square and the case against secularist orthodoxy
Neuhaus's signature thesis entered the canon with **The Naked Public Square** in 1984. The book argued that a secularist project, abetted by Supreme Court jurisprudence and elite culture, sought to exclude **religious speech** from democratic deliberation, thereby strip-mining the traditions that nourish **virtue** and **civic friendship**. He contended that the Constitution's **Establishment Clause** should be interpreted to prevent state establishment of religion, not to establish a **religion of secularism**. The critique engaged both **liberal Protestantism**, which had surrendered thick doctrinal claims for moralistic platitudes, and **secular liberalism**, which demanded **public reason** purged of comprehensive convictions. Neuhaus insisted that religious citizens must speak as religious citizens, and that the polity must welcome such speech as a resource for **the common good**.

The argument rested on **natural law** and the claim that public reasons need not be religiously neutral to be publicly accessible. He anticipated and resisted later **Rawlsian** constraints on public discourse by arguing that to bracket ultimate convictions is to distort agency and to invite nihilism. The book also set his lifelong motif, the **American experiment** as a project that depends upon **transcendent moral truth**. He criticized a court-led moral revolution on **life**, **marriage**, and **education**, predicting a culture war that would define public life for decades. The **naked public square** became a phrase of art, a polemical name for the pretense that a morally minimal proceduralism could sustain **ordered liberty**.

#### 4. The Catholic Moment, Murray, and magisterial alignment
With **The Catholic Moment** in 1987, Neuhaus advanced the thesis that the **Roman Catholic** Church possessed the intellectual and institutional resources to underwrite the moral foundations of American democracy. He drew from **John Courtney Murray's** account of **natural law**, **constitutionalism**, and **civic friendship**, suggesting that the exhaustion of **mainline Protestant** public theology created a vacuum the **Catholic Church** could fill. He aligned himself with **John Paul II**, whose encyclicals on **human dignity**, **religious freedom**, and the **culture of life** supplied a canon for public engagement, especially **Veritatis Splendor** 1993 and **Evangelium Vitae** 1995. Neuhaus's wager was that a robust, evangelically minded **Catholicism** could furnish a coherent moral grammar without demanding confessional establishment.

This thesis was strategic and ecclesial. It rallied pro-life and pro-family coalitions under a **natural-law** canopy, fostered **ecumenism** with **evangelicals**, and moved from his earlier Lutheranism to a high-church Catholic identity that prized **magisterium**, **sacrament**, and **communio**. The claim drew critique from **Hauerwas**, who suspected a baptizing of American civil religion, and from secularists who feared a confessional capture of politics. Neuhaus replied that **subsidiarity** and **civil society** protect pluralism, that a polity of **mediating institutions** resists both statist homogenization and libertarian atomism, and that the **church** speaks as servant of the truth for the sake of *bonum commune*, the common good.

#### 5. Mediating structures, civil society, and economic life
Before and beyond his Catholic turn, Neuhaus developed with **Peter L. Berger** the theory of **mediating structures**, most notably in **To Empower People** in 1977. The thesis was that families, neighborhoods, churches, and voluntary associations mediate between individual and state, forming persons in virtue and channeling participation in **public life**. This sociological analysis complemented **Catholic subsidiarity**, a doctrine that assigns tasks to the most local competent level, and **solidarity**, the moral bond that unites the rich and poor in a shared destiny. Neuhaus translated these into policy guidance, favoring school choice, charitable choice in welfare policy, and protections for religious institutions, so that **civil society** could thicken the moral ecology of democracy.

In **Doing Well and Doing Good** in 1992, he addressed the relation of **market economy** and **moral culture**, arguing against both statist planning and libertarian amoralism. The market can serve the **common good** when embedded in a moral order informed by **virtue**, **solidarity**, and **the rule of law**. Here **natural law** again carries analytic weight, enabling judgments about human flourishing that surpass mere preference satisfaction. Neuhaus never produced a formal treatise on **economics**, but his essays consistently pressed the claim that economic freedom requires moral constraints, and that **religious communities** are essential carriers of those constraints into public debate.

#### 6. Evangelicals and Catholics Together and soteriological convergence
Neuhaus will be remembered as a principal architect of **Evangelicals and Catholics Together** in 1994, a project undertaken with **Charles Colson** and others to articulate consensus on **the gospel** for the sake of cultural witness. The initial ECT statement sought a common mission on **life**, **marriage**, and public morality, and it ventured theological convergence on **justification**. The 1997 follow up, **The Gift of Salvation**, claimed agreement that salvation is by **grace alone**, in **Christ alone**, received by **faith**, while acknowledging unresolved matters regarding **imputation**, **the nature of the new birth**, and **assurance**. Neuhaus viewed such agreements as significant fruits of **ecumenism**, made urgent by the cultural crisis marked by the **culture of death** and the **naked public square**.

Critics charged that ECT obscured real differences on **justification** and **authority**, that it risked a lowest-common-denominator **gospel** for the sake of political coalition. Neuhaus replied that ECT did not dilute doctrine, that it honored **magisterial** commitments on the Catholic side and **Scripture's** primacy on the evangelical side, and that public collaboration need not presuppose ecclesial unity. He framed the effort as an application of **John 17** to the common tasks of culture, grounded in a nascent but real **consensus on essentials** sharpened by **natural law** and by shared moral commitments taught by **John Paul II's** magisterium and retrieved by evangelical ressourcement.

#### 7. The cross, death, and pastoral theology of hope
Although best known for public argument, Neuhaus wrote profoundly theological works on **death**, **atonement**, and **pastoral ministry**. **Freedom for Ministry** in 1979 presented a spirituality of clerical service grounded in **sacrament** and **Word**, insisting that ministry is a participation in the **freedom of the gospel** that orders the church toward **mission** in the world. **Death on a Friday Afternoon** in 2000 offered meditations on the Seven Last Words, drawing from **Augustine**, **Anselm**, and **John Paul II** to present the **cross** as the grammar of divine love, a pedagogy of **mercy** and **truth** in conflict and reconciliation. The book is an exercise in doctrinal catechesis for a culture adrift, presenting **atonement** as both objective and pastoral, and linking **justification**, **sanctification**, and the **sacramental** life.

In **As I Lay Dying** in 2002, Neuhaus wrote from near-death, integrating **mortal fragility** with **eschatological hope**. He affirmed the **resurrection of the body**, the communion of **saints**, and the **viaticum** of the Eucharist as the church's gift at the boundary of life and death. These works demonstrate that Neuhaus's **public theology** was not a substitute for dogmatics but an extension of **Catholic faith** into cultural argument. The liturgy, **sacrament**, and **magisterium** supply the matter he carries into the **public square**, and the **natural law** method supplies the form by which he proposes it to neighbors who do not share the creed.

#### 8. Later reflections, controversy, and exilic chastening
Neuhaus's later writings, including **Appointment in Rome** in 1998, **Catholic Matters** in 2006, and **American Babylon** in 2009, exhibit chastened confidence. The 1996 **First Things** symposium, **The End of Democracy**, provoked fierce debate by suggesting that judicial overreach threatened the legitimacy of the regime. Some allies resigned, critics accused him of illiberal theocracy, yet Neuhaus defended the essay as an Augustinian warning about the limits of **positive law** severed from **moral law**. In **American Babylon**, published the year of his death, he retrieved **Augustine's** two cities to argue that Christians are pilgrims and exiles in any earthly polity, including America, that the **church** must both love and critique the **saeculum** as it pursues the **common good**.

This exilic turn did not renounce the **Catholic Moment** but relativized it, subordinating national projects to **eschatological hope** and to the penitential realism appropriate to the **cross**. He maintained a posture of principled engagement under **subsidiarity**, committed to **civil society**, and resolute in defending the **culture of life** against abortion, euthanasia, and biotechnological assaults on human dignity. He continued to read **John Paul II** and **Benedict XVI** as teachers of reason for the public square, pressing **natural law** as a grammar by which appeal to **truth** could be made without coercion. Neuhaus remained until his death a parish priest, a confessor, a celebrant of the **Eucharist**, and the voice of **The Public Square**, where the interplay of **doctrine**, **politics**, and **culture** remained his living classroom.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Neuhaus commands respect for his **Augustinian realism**, his defense of **religious freedom**, and his recognition that the **saeculum** cannot finally sustain **ordered liberty** without appeal to **truth**. Yet three tensions emerge. First, the reliance on **natural law** as public method conflicts with a **Scripture-sufficient** epistemology that insists that special revelation is principial for all moral reasoning. Reformed theology affirms general revelation and the *lex naturalis*, but it warns that postlapsarian reason suppresses truth apart from **regeneration**, so a natural-law public reason may yield only minimal moral consensus and may tacitly authorize the very **proceduralism** Neuhaus attacks. Second, the **church and state** nexus leans on **Murray's** integrationist model, which risks a soft **Constantinianism** in which the **church's** pilgrim identity is harnessed to a national project, even in qualified form. A **two-kingdoms** account would underline the distinct administrations of **Word and sacrament** and **civil justice**, preserving Christian freedom while tempering ambitions for culture-wide retrieval. Third, **ECT**'s convergence language on **justification** and assurance remains ambiguous when measured by **sola fide** as confessionally defined, especially regarding **imputation** and the instrumental nature of **faith**. The Reformed alternative would encourage principled cooperation on **natural goods** under **common grace**, while insisting that the **gospel** not be submerged under coalition politics, that **law and gospel** be carefully distinguished in public rhetoric, and that appeals to **natural law** be candidly subordinated to the primacy of **Scripture**, **covenant**, and the kingship of **Christ** over conscience and church.
