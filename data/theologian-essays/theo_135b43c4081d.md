### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Black Death 1348–49**, **Statute of Labourers 1351**, **poll taxes 1377–1381**, and the **Peasants' Revolt 1381** set the crucible for **John Ball** as a radical preacher within **late medieval Catholic** society.
- Vernacular homiletics grounded in **Scripture’s sensus literalis**, aphoristic moral exhortation, and a populist deployment of **dominium ex gratia** against elite claims of **canon law** and **feudal potestas**.
- Sermons and sayings attributed c. **1377–1381**; the **Blackheath sermon 1381**; alleged **Letters to the Commons 1381**; fragments preserved by **Thomas Walsingham** and **Henry Knighton**.
- Core categories: **dominium**, **natural equality**, **lex Christi** as evangelical norm, **communio bonorum** in Acts, critique of **plenitudo potestatis** and clerical wealth.
- Dialogue and influence: **John Wyclif**, **Franciscan Spirituals** on **apostolic poverty**, **Marsilius of Padua** on **ecclesiastical jurisdiction**, and scholastic debates in **Aquinas** and **Ockham** on **dominium** and **ius naturale**; adversarial chroniclers **Walsingham**, **Knighton**, **Gower**.
- Reformed reception: proto-Protestant cues toward **vernacular Scripture** and critique of **sacramental mediation**, but tension with Reformed **two kingdoms**, **covenant order**, and rejection of revolutionary **levelling**.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the pastoral economy of crisis
The figure of **John Ball** emerges from the social and ecclesial fractures of **late medieval England**, where the **Black Death 1348–49** reconfigured demographics, wages, and authority, and where the **Statute of Labourers 1351** attempted to reassert a rigid **status servilis**. Ball appears by the **1360s** as a secular cleric, often styled in hostile sources as St Mary’s priest of York or of Colchester, but functioning more as a peripatetic preacher driven by **cura animarum** outside diocesan control. Repeated censures from **bishop and archbishop**, culminating in directives under **Archbishop Simon Sudbury** to silence him, trace a career of preaching that struck the nerve of the **sacramental economy** and of **canon law** patronage. Against the dominant scholastic order, Ball cultivated a vernacular ministry shaped by **biblical aphorism**, a reimagined **dominium**, and an insistence that the **lex Christi** stands above feudal privilege and clerical immunity. The result is not a university theologian’s Summa but a popular theology catalyzed by plague, poll taxes 1377–1381, and the grinding inequities of **feudal potestas**.

The intellectual horizon framing Ball overlaps with the early **Wycliffite** ferment at Oxford, the long debate over **apostolic poverty** between **Franciscan Spirituals** and the **curia**, and political-theological critiques by **Marsilius of Padua** and **William of Ockham** against papal **plenitudo potestatis**. In this matrix, keywords like **dominium ex gratia**, **ius naturale**, and **communio rerum** gave moral leverage to contest social and ecclesial domination. Ball’s setting is thus decisively **Catholic** in institutional form and sacramental grammar, yet subversive in his deployment of those very categories against prevailing regimes of **clerical lordship** and **monastic wealth**.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance: from school to street
Ball’s method is homiletical and prophetic, eschewing the ladders of **scholastic disputation** for the immediacy of **Scripture’s sensus literalis** and the punch of vernacular rhyme. The celebrated refrain, When Adam delved and Eve span, who was then the gentleman?, functions as a compressed theological thesis that treats **Genesis** as a political text: prelapsarian **natural equality** is the deep norm of creation, while stratified **dominium** is a postlapsarian distortion. That method privileges authoritative **biblical exempla** and axioms drawn from **Acts 2–4** on **communio bonorum**, **Luke 22** on dominion among rulers, and the **Beatitudes** as the public ethic of the **kingdom of God**. The epistemic stance is a populist **auctoritas Scripturae** set over and against what Ball treats as humanly contrived **canon law** and revenue-producing ecclesial customs such as fees, fines, and appropriations.

His conceptual economy symbiotically draws from the Oxford **Wyclif** who had begun developing **dominium ex gratia** by the late 1370s. While **Wyclif** argued that true lordship is contingent upon the state of grace, Ball radicalized the claim rhetorically to judge both **temporal lordship** and **clerical jurisdiction** by the evangelical rule of **lex Christi**. Ball’s sermons do not race through the fourfold senses of Scripture; they lodge in the **literal and moral sense**, bristling with apocalyptic urgency. He thus inverts scholastic priority, subordinating **canonistic** and **feudal categories** to a direct reading of the **evangelical law** that binds kings, bishops, and commons alike.

#### 3. Works, sources, and transmission: a theology in fragments
Ball left no **Summa** or formal treatise. His theology has to be reconstructed from attributed sermons, satirical rhymes, and letters copied by opponents such as **Thomas Walsingham** in the Chronicon Angliae and by **Henry Knighton**, as well as hints in **John Gower’s** Vox Clamantis. The **Blackheath sermon 1381** is the nodal text of transmission, where the refrain about Adam and Eve frames an argument about **dominium** grounded in creation rather than coercive custom. The alleged **Letters to the Commons 1381**, one opening with the persona John Schep and calling for recognition of the poor as God’s people, press toward a social realignment under the **law of Christ** and away from **servile status**. The tone is exhortatory and aphoristic, not scholastic, and it always returns to **Scripture’s authority** over **human ordinances**.

Fragments delineate concrete complaints: unjust **tithes**, **clerical absenteeism**, and the **opulent monasteries** that hoarded land; punitive exactions by lords and sheriffs; the burden of **poll tax**; and the sellable nature of ecclesiastical grace in **indulgences** or fees. Ball’s homiletic corpus is therefore an archive of grievances shot through with theological grammar. Even reported by enemies, it reveals a consistent symbolic order in which **Genesis** and **Acts** trump **canon law** and in which **Christ’s poverty** unmasks the distortion of a Church enthroned in **temporal dominion**.

#### 4. Creation, fall, and the grammar of equality
At the core of Ball’s doctrine stands an anthropology of **natural equality** that reads **creation and fall** as the decisive hinge of social order. In the beginning humans shared a common task and common goods, with labor named as a vocation rather than a marker of caste. The fall introduces domination, exploitation, and a degraded **status servilis**, all of which are treated as alien intrusions relative to **ius naturale**. Ball’s repeated appeal to Adam and Eve is not a pastoral platitude; it is a theological indictment against the supposed naturalness of feudal hierarchy. He constructs, in effect, a moral metaphysic where **dominium** is measured by its conformity to *lex naturae* and especially to the **lex Christi** that restores justice.

The consequence is a robust evangelical moralism. Ball calls for repentance, restitution, and the reordering of social relations under **Christ’s lordship**. The **Beatitudes** and the **Magnificat** become socio-political texts; the powerful are warned, the poor are blessed, and the proud are scattered. His horizon is not merely spiritualized; it is this-worldly and insists on corporate obedience to **gospel law**. Though Ball does not articulate a developed doctrine of **grace and nature**, his polemics imply that grace unmasks oppressive structures and summons the baptized to a **communio bonorum** that honors human dignity grounded in **imago Dei**.

#### 5. Dominium, property, and political theology
Ball’s political theology turns on the volatile notion of **dominium ex gratia**. Under the influence of **John Wyclif**, he implies that all true lordship is conditioned by grace and hence that ungraced possession is morally defective and subject to recall. In this register, both **feudal property** and **clerical endowments** stand under judgment. While **Aquinas** had defended private property as a determination of **natural law** toward the common good, Ball tilts toward a common use ethic where private accumulation by ungraced lords is theft-by-custom, violating the **communio rerum** that marked the apostolic church in **Acts**. He challenges the legitimacy of villeinage and presses for elected local officers, a diminution of **aristocratic potestas**, and a redirection of wealth toward communal need.

Here Ball resonates with the wider disputes of his century. The **Franciscan Spirituals** had argued that **apostolic poverty** is evangelical perfection; **Marsilius of Padua** had argued that coercive jurisdiction belongs to the polity, not the bishop; **Ockham** had denied papal plenary power over temporal goods. Though not a schoolman, Ball’s preaching functionalizes these moves, converting scholastic controversy into moral slogans. The stability of **dominium** stands and falls with **grace** and **justice**, not bare title or custom. Property, power, and priesthood must be sifted by **lex Christi**, and what fails that test has no theological right to command obedience.

#### 6. Church, sacrament, and the economy of grace
Ball’s ecclesiology is antagonistic to **clerical wealth**, **indulgence traffic**, and **sacramental fees**. He calls for a return to **apostolic poverty**, for a de-professionalizing of mediation, and for **vernacular Scripture** in the parish. While he remains within a **Catholic** horizon and does not, in the sources, develop a polemic against the **sacraments** as such, he attacks their capture by a class of **unpastoral clergy**. In this he tracks the broader **Lollard** suspicion of pilgrimage, image cult, and the commercialization of grace, without leaving us a clear position on contested dogmas like **transubstantiation**. His target is institutional deformation more than metaphysical specification.

By treating **lex Christi** as the measuring rod of the Church’s life, Ball implicitly rejects **plenitudo potestatis** in its financial and jurisdictional form. The bishop is not an extractor of wealth but a servant of the poor; the priest is not a landlord but a minister of the **Word**. Ball’s ecclesiology thus recalibrates **potestas** as diakonia, anchoring ministerial authority in service rather than property. The unity of the Church is moral and evangelical, not curial and fiscal. The result is a proto-reformist ecclesial imagination that demands pastoral presence, integrity in office, and the dismantling of wealth as the sign of **spiritual authority**.

#### 7. Rhetoric, apocalyptic horizon, and revolutionary contagion
Ball’s rhetoric is apocalyptic and proverbial. He peppers his addresses with cadences that evoke the **prophets**, the **Magnificat**, and **Revelation**. Judgment is imminent; the Lord will cast down the mighty and lift up the lowly; the time is now to enact **kingdom** justice. This tone electrified the commons gathered at **Blackheath in June 1381**, where the **Wat Tyler** movement coalesced around calls to abolish villeinage, reduce rents, and purge corrupt officials. Ball’s role, though refracted through hostile chroniclers, reveals a theological motor animating political demands. The couplet about Adam and Eve is not a slogan only; it is an eschatological summons to align social forms with creation and the gospel.

The apocalyptic edge explains both attraction and alarm. To the commons, **lex Christi** offered warrant and hope; to authorities, it signaled sedition cloaked in piety. Ball’s language is deliberately public and untechnical, forged for memory and mobilization. In contrast to academic quaestiones, aphorisms travel, and in 1381 they traveled into city gates, manor courts, and palace halls, unsettling the grammar of **obedience**. Rhetoric thus functions as theological method, catalyzing a revolutionary contagion grounded in **Scripture** and **justice**.

#### 8. Suppression, judgment, and afterlives
The revolt’s failure brought swift reprisals. **Archbishop Simon Sudbury** was himself killed by rebels in the Tower, but the monarchy reasserted control, and Ball was captured and executed, hanged, drawn, and quartered at **St Albans on 15 July 1381**. Chroniclers like **Thomas Walsingham** and **Henry Knighton** portrayed him as the theological engineer of rebellion, extracting lines and letters to illustrate the dangers of **Lollardy**. In the decades that followed, **Lollard** networks persisted, surfacing in episodes such as the **Oldcastle** rising, and the memory of Ball endured as a cautionary tale of clerical agitation. His theological fragments were deployed to stigmatize the vernacular preacher who dared to weigh **lordship** by **grace**.

Early Protestants sometimes read the **Lollards** as forerunners, and in English memory the name **John Ball** acquired a confusing homonym in the later **Puritan** divine **John Ball 1585–1640**, whose covenant theology is an altogether different project. Yet the late medieval Ball’s afterlife is discernible in later critiques of **church wealth**, in **egalitarian** currents that invoke creation’s equality, and in the persistent call for **vernacular Scripture** and pastoral reform. As an academic theologian he is thin; as a theological catalyst he is indelible.

#### 9. Theological appraisal: strengths, limits, and comparison
Measured against the great syntheses of **Aquinas** and the Augustinian tradition on **grace and nature**, Ball’s work is not a system but a grammar of protest. Its strength lies in the moral clarity of **creation-fall** as a diagnostic of oppression, in re-centering **lex Christi** as a public norm, and in reframing **dominium** as a vocation accountable to **justice** and **grace**. He reclaims **Scripture’s authority** against the weaponization of **canon law**, and he indicts the capture of **sacramental** ministry by wealth. These moves illuminate genuine deformations within late medieval **Catholic** society and rightly insist that theological truth is not quarantined from social practice.

The limits are the mirror of the strengths. Ball tends to collapse the complex relation of **nature and grace** into a single rule of **evangelical law**, such that the goods of political order risk being measured only by egalitarian outcomes. His version of **dominium ex gratia** threatens juridical catastrophe if taken literally, since it renders property and office perpetually precarious in the face of unverifiable judgments about **grace**. Where **Aquinas** carefully adjudicated **ius naturale** and **ius gentium**, Ball thrusts moral prophecy into the space of political prudence. And unlike **Augustine’s** two cities discourse, Ball’s apocalyptic rhetoric elides the tragic and provisional character of temporal peace, risking perfectionist expectations that history cannot bear. Yet even here, he speaks as a necessary corrective to a Church that had sacralized wealth and hardened custom into **dogma**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: points of contact and principled contrast
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, **John Ball** exhibits both anticipations and tensions. On the positive side, his vernacular **auctoritas Scripturae**, his insistence that **Word** governs **Church** and **magistrate**, and his protest against **clerical domination** resonate with **sola Scriptura** and the **priesthood of all believers**. His appeal to **creation** and the **moral law** aligns in part with a Reformed use of **natural law** as clarified by **lex Dei**, and his critique of sacramental commercialization anticipates reform of the **sacramental economy**. Yet principled contrasts are decisive. Reformed theology distinguishes **creation order** from **redemption** through a covenantal schema, notably the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, preserving stable social vocations under **Romans 13** while calling magistrates and ministers to reform under Scripture. Ball’s leveling deployment of **dominium ex gratia** risks erasing the legitimacy of civil order under common grace and distorts the Reformed two kingdoms or two governments doctrine, which keeps the **regnum Christi** by Word and Spirit distinct from temporal administration. Where Ball absolutizes **lex Christi** as a direct social program, the Reformed tradition would urge a mediating account of **natural law**, **common grace**, and **covenantal offices**, seeking reformation without revolutionary conflation of eschaton and saeculum. Consequently, a WTS evaluation would honor Ball’s prophetic exposure of real corruptions and his Scripture-forward method, while correcting his theological reductionism with a richer account of **nature and grace**, **law and gospel**, and the differentiated yet accountable spheres of **church and state** under the **lordship of Christ**.
