### ESSAY
Anthony A. Hoekema’s enduring contribution lies in a carefully integrated **Reformed dogmatics** that holds **anthropology**, **soteriology**, and **eschatology** together by the nerve center of **union with Christ** and the horizon of the **new earth**. Across **The Bible and the Future** published in 1979, **Created in God’s Image** published in 1986, and **Saved by Grace** published posthumously in 1989, Hoekema refused compartmentalized loci and instead advanced a **biblico-theological** synthesis in which the **imago Dei** is renewed through **salvation** toward **eschatological consummation**. His earlier polemical studies, **The Four Major Cults** published in 1963 and **What about Tongue-Speaking?** published in 1966, reveal the same pastoral and hermeneutical posture: test movements by the **authority of Scripture**, the centrality of **Christ**, and the coherence of the **covenant of grace**. The arc from apologetic discernment to constructive dogmatics is uninterrupted, a hallmark of his **Reformed confessionalism** and his **Kuyperian** instinct that doctrine must serve the life of the church within God’s world.

Born in 1913 in the Netherlands and shaped by Dutch immigrant **Christian Reformed** culture in North America, Hoekema came of age as the **Neo-Calvinist** legacy of **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** met the challenges of mid-century American **evangelicalism**. His pastoral ministry in the **CRC** preceded his appointment to **Calvin Theological Seminary** in 1958, where he taught **systematic theology** until retirement in the late 1970s. Advanced study at **Princeton Theological Seminary** in the early 1950s acquainted him with broader currents in **biblical theology**, particularly the redemptive-historical insights of **Geerhardus Vos** and later **Herman Ridderbos**. The result was neither scholastic repristination nor liberal revision, but a disciplined submission of **systematic theology** to the canon’s narrative shape, governed by the **Reformed confessions**. In the postwar decades, when **dispensationalism** and **Pentecostalism** were reshaping American Protestant piety, Hoekema sought a robustly biblical alternative rooted in **covenant theology**, **amillennial** eschatology, and the Christocentric heart of the **gospel**.

Hoekema’s method combines a high doctrine of **Scripture** with hermeneutical attentiveness to the Bible’s unfolding **covenantal** plot. He is consistently wary of both a narrow **proof-texting biblicism** and a speculative **dogmatic rationalism**, insisting that doctrine must grow out of exegesis traced along the **redemptive-historical** line from promise to fulfillment in **Christ**. The paradigmatic frame is the **already–not yet** of the **kingdom of God**, which orients both **ordo salutis** and **ecclesiology** within **historia salutis**. He leans on **Kuyperian** and **Dooyeweerdian** distinctions of **structure** and **direction**, arguing that the creation’s structures remain good while their sinful direction requires radical reorientation through **regeneration** and **sanctification**. This yields a principled affirmation of **common grace**, a careful resistance to **nature–grace dualisms**, and a relentless drive to situate **ethics** and **culture** within the comprehensive scope of **redemption**. Underneath is an unembarrassed affirmation of **Reformed orthodoxy** on **divine sovereignty**, **total depravity**, and **grace**, construed within the expository cadence of biblical theology.

The apologetic and pastoral turn of **The Four Major Cults** displays Hoekema’s criteria for doctrinal fidelity. He exposes the structural deviations of **Christian Science**, **Jehovah’s Witnesses**, **Mormonism**, and **Seventh-day Adventism** in terms of **revelatory authority**, **triune theism**, **Christology**, and **soteriology**. His analysis of **additional revelations**, whether the **Book of Mormon** or the **Watchtower** corpus, serves a larger claim about **sola Scriptura** and the sufficiency of the **canon**. He argues that distortions of **Christ’s person and work** invariably produce deviations in **grace** and **assurance**, a thesis he will echo in **Saved by Grace** on **justification** and **sanctification**. The companion critique in **What about Tongue-Speaking?** resists the elevation of **glossolalia** and a second blessing doctrine of **Spirit baptism** into marks of spiritual maturity. Reading **Acts** within a **salvation-historical** horizon, Hoekema contends that **Pentecost** is a once-for-all event that inaugurates the era of the **Spirit**, not a repeatable norm prescribing **miraculous gifts** for every believer. The pastoral aim is to protect the church’s assurance in **Christ** and to ground **pneumatology** within **union with Christ**, rather than in post-conversion experiences that threaten **sola gratia**.

The center of gravity in **The Bible and the Future** is the **kingdom of God** as already present in **Christ** yet awaiting consummation in the **parousia**. Against **premillennialism** and **postmillennialism**, he defends **amillennialism** by a close reading of **Revelation 20**, interpreting the **millennium** as the entire interadvental age and the binding of **Satan** as Christ’s defeat that restrains his deceiving of the nations. He argues for the **bodily resurrection** of believers and the wicked, the **intermediate state** in conscious fellowship or separation, the universality of the **final judgment**, and the reality of **hell** as just recompense. The book’s signature contribution is its rich doctrine of the **new earth**, which refuses a purely heavenly eschatology in favor of the **resurrection** and **renewal** of creation. Hoekema emphasizes continuity and discontinuity, insisting that while the present order will be purified from sin, there is meaningful persistence of creaturely **structure** transfigured by **glory**. This framework also underwrites his critique of **dispensationalism**. He defends the unity of **Israel and the church** within the **covenant of grace**, contending that the promises find their telos in **Christ** and the one redeemed people of God. In sum, **eschatology** does not merely close the story. It shapes **ethics**, **worship**, and cultural stewardship now.

In **Created in God’s Image**, Hoekema offers a sustained **anthropology** that is at once exegetical and doctrinally alert. He rejects **trichotomy** and a crude **dichotomy** alike, arguing for a **holistic duality** of **body and soul** in genuine unity, with the **image of God** encompassing the entire person. The **imago Dei** is described under **structural**, **functional**, and **relational** dimensions. Structural image refers to endowments such as rationality and morality, functional image to the human vocation of **dominion**, and relational image to communion with **God** and neighbor. Hoekema contends that the image is not lost in the **Fall**, but is profoundly marred and corrupt in its direction. This anthropology grounds his account of **sin** and **grace**. **Total depravity** does not annihilate creaturely structure, and **common grace** stabilizes cultural life, yet the direction of the human heart requires sovereign **renewal**. He affirms the **body’s goodness**, rejects **Gnostic** tendencies, and upholds the **intermediate state** without conceding to **Platonism**. The result is an anthropology attuned to **creation–fall–redemption**, geared to the renewal of the image in **sanctification**, and ordered toward the **glorification** of embodied life on the **new earth**.

The soteriological monograph **Saved by Grace** unfolds salvation from the vantage point of **union with Christ**, integrating the **ordo salutis** with the **historia salutis**. **Election** is unto **Christ**, **effectual calling** and **regeneration** are acts of sovereign **grace**, and **faith** and **repentance** are evangelical graces that unite the sinner to the risen Lord. Hoekema is unequivocal on **justification** as a forensic verdict by **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, maintaining **sola fide** and the **exclusivity of Christ’s merit**. He clarifies the relationship of **law and gospel**, with the **third use of the law** guiding grateful obedience. **Sanctification** is definitive and progressive, the definitive aspect grounded in union with the crucified and risen Christ, the progressive aspect summoning Spirit-enabled effort without collapsing into **legalism** or **perfectionism**. He expounds **assurance** as the fruit of the promises, the Spirit’s testimony, and the evidences of renewal, without making assurance the essence of faith. The chapter on **perseverance of the saints** is pastoral and God-centered, aligning with classic **Canons of Dort** commitments. Throughout, the note of **ecclesial means** is clear. The **Word**, **sacraments**, and **prayer** are appointed instruments for the believer’s growth, and the **church** is the communio where grace is ordinarily dispensed.

While these volumes are distinct in subject, they share a coherent ontology of **creation** and **redemption** that refuses dualisms. Hoekema’s appeal to **structure and direction** keeps the integrity of created kinds and institutions in view, while demanding a radical redirection through **Christ** and the **Spirit**. His **new earth** eschatology energizes cultural obedience under the **lordship of Christ**, sustaining a robust **eschatological hope** that is neither escapist nor triumphalist. In **anthropology**, the recovery of the **imago Dei** is tethered to **sanctification** and **glorification**. In **soteriology**, **union with Christ** functions as architectonic principle, integrating forensic and renovative benefits without confusion. In **apologetics**, the tests are consistent. Does a movement honor **Scripture** alone as supreme authority. Does it confess the **Trinity** and the two natures of **Christ**. Does it secure **grace alone** in salvation. The unity is methodological and doxological, not merely topical.

Hoekema’s interlocutors clarify his place within twentieth-century **Reformed theology**. He draws deeply from **Calvin’s** focus on **union with Christ**, amplifies **Bavinck’s** integrated **dogmatics**, and appropriates **Berkouwer’s** conversational dogmatic method that lets **Scripture** lead. From **Ridderbos** and **Vos** he learns to read **Paul** and **Revelation** within the sweep of **redemptive history**, yielding his hallmark **already–not yet** eschatology. His cautious use of **Dooyeweerd** and the **structure-direction** grammar keeps him in the **Neo-Calvinist** orbit while maintaining confessional ballast. Against **dispensational** theologians such as **Walvoord** and **Ryrie**, he defends the unity of the **covenant of grace**, a non-chiliast reading of **Revelation 20**, and the ecclesial identity of the **people of God**. Against **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** claims, he contends for a once-for-all **Spirit baptism** coincident with Christ’s exaltation and the believer’s incorporation into him. Against the **cults**, he guards the sufficiency of **Scripture** and the uniqueness of **Christ**. The conversation partners thus range from classical **Reformed scholasticism** to contemporary evangelical movements, and Hoekema consistently adjudicates them by the **Word** read within the **covenant**.

The legacy of **Hoekema** is more than the sum of his volumes. In classrooms at **Calvin Theological Seminary** and beyond, he modeled a **systematics** that listens to **exegesis**, resists anxious polemics, and serves the **church’s mission**. His articulation of the **new earth** influenced evangelical discussions of **creation care** and vocational stewardship, while his insistence on **justification by faith** and **assurance** protected tender consciences from the oscillations of experience-driven spirituality. His account of the **imago Dei** has been widely cited for balancing **structural** and **functional** dimensions, especially in debates about human dignity and cultural calling. The soteriological center of **union with Christ** helped reconnect forensic and transformative grace among pastors and students wary of false tensions. Across these themes, Hoekema unified the Reformed commitment to **grace**, the authority of **Scripture**, and the cosmic scope of **redemption**.

A Reformed and WTS evaluation can be concise. Strengths abound in his clear **amillennial** exegesis, his architectonic use of **union with Christ**, and his robust **new earth** teleology, all consonant with **Westminster Standards** on **Scripture**, **justification**, and **sanctification**. Questions arise where **structure-direction** could be overextended, risking a flattening of **nature–grace** that blurs the pilgrim tension of the **two ages**. A Westminster alternative would stress a stronger **pilgrim identity** and a sharper **eschatological antithesis** within cultural life, while still affirming **common grace**. On **pneumatology**, Hoekema’s functional **cessationism** sits alongside WTS diversity, yet his insistence that **Spirit baptism** coincides with **union with Christ** is a salutary corrective to second-blessing schemes. On **covenant theology**, he warmly affirms the **covenant of grace** and **Adam’s federal headship**, though he leaves less explored the **Mosaic covenant** and issues of **republication**, where Westminster voices might prefer clearer typological and legal-gospel distinctions. In sum, Hoekema’s synthesis remains a reliable, pastorally rich exposition of **Reformed orthodoxy**, and where tensions surface they invite sharpened attention to the relation of **revelation**, **covenant**, and **eschatology** rather than any retreat from his core commitments.
