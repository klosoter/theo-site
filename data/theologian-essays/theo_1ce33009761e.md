- **Spirituality of the church, verbal plenary inspiration, federal headship and immediate imputation, Calvin’s spiritual presence, two-spheres governance, natural law and moral philosophy** are controlling categories.
- **Westminster Standards, John Calvin, Charles Hodge, New School theology, abolitionist ecclesiology, Erastian establishment theories** supply interlocutors and targets.
- **Reformed reception is mixed**: doctrinal orthodoxy and ecclesial clarity, yet grave ethical failure and philosophical naivete undercut catholic Reformed witness.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and intellectual habits
James Henley Thornwell, born in 1812 in South Carolina and deceased in 1862 amid the American Civil War, emerged as the Southern Old School Presbyterian articulation of **confessional Calvinism** joined to a vigorous doctrine of the **spirituality of the church**. His formation traversed the South Carolina College and the Columbia Theological Seminary, where **Scottish Common Sense Realism** and the **Westminster Standards** furnished his intellectual grammar. The Old School New School controversy of 1837 to 1838, with **Charles Hodge** championing confessional precision against Edwardsean moral experimentalism, furnished Thornwell a template for doctrinal and institutional consolidation. He taught rhetoric and moral philosophy, pastored in Columbia, presided at South Carolina College in the early 1850s, and then served as professor of theology at Columbia Theological Seminary. As editor of the **Southern Presbyterian Review** from 1847 forward, he mastered the periodical essay as theological weapon. These roles coalesced into a public theologian whose signature thesis was that Christ rules his church through **jure divino Presbyterianism**, that the church’s authority is strictly **spiritual** not civil, and that the Scripture is **verbally and plenarily inspired**, norming ethics, worship, and polity in one seamless **ordo**.

Thornwell’s intellectual posture drew deeply from **Scottish moral philosophy** associated with **Thomas Reid** and **Dugald Stewart**, mediated through American colleges. He argued that theology rests upon **first principles** that are self-evident in conscience and reason, though he subordinated these to the **autopistos** authority of Scripture. He invoked **natural law** as the moral texture of creation, illuminated and corrected by revelation. His rhetoric is saturated with **federal theology** and **covenant categories** while appealing to what he called the constitution of human nature. This conjuncture of **Common Sense Realism** with **classical Reformed orthodoxy** becomes the engine of his arguments about ecclesial authority, sacramental efficacy, and civil society.

#### 2. Method and sources: jure divino reasoning under Scripture
Thornwell’s method makes a threefold pledge: the **verbal plenary inspiration** of the canonical Scriptures as the principium cognoscendi, a strong **confessionalism** that reads doctrine through the **Westminster Confession and Catechisms**, and a **jure divino** account of church order. He insisted that the church’s power is **ministerial and declarative** only, a Reformed axiom he wields as institutional critique. In essays later collected in the **Collected Writings 1871–1873**, he regularly invoked the **regulative principle of worship** and the regulative principle of government, arguing that what Christ has not instituted the church may not bind. He considered the visible church the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, ruled *ad extra* by Christ’s word and Spirit, with office-bearers as stewards of a **spiritual jurisdiction** distinct from civil coercion.

The epistemic style of **Common Sense Realism** allowed Thornwell to claim that Scriptural doctrines cohere with the settled judgments of reason and conscience, while resisting rationalism. Hence his polemics against **New School** voluntarism and **Edwardsean** reconstructions of virtue appeal both to exegesis and to the moral sense. Yet he would not concede to **Erastianism** any right of the state to determine doctrine or worship. The net effect is a methodological triad: **Scripture alone**, **confession as ruled reading**, and **natural law once tutored by revelation**, all deployed in defense of a church free from civil determination and also free from para-ecclesial usurpation.

#### 3. Boards and committees: ecclesial form as theological substance
The famous controversy over missionary and educational **boards** versus **committees** becomes, in Thornwell’s hands, a decisive test of **jure divino Presbyterianism**. In his 1841 essay **The Church Boards**, he criticized the nineteenth-century proliferation of quasi-corporate boards that, though under ecclesiastical auspices, functioned as semi-independent agencies. For Thornwell, such boards migrated authority from the courts of the church to bureaucratic bodies, violating the erection of government in **sessions, presbyteries, synods, and general assembly** given by Christ. He favored **committees** directly accountable to the church courts as the only legitimate instruments of mission and education. The point is not mere efficiency but protection of **ministerial and declarative power** from managerial accretions.

This institutional theology brought him into intense conversation with **Charles Hodge** and other Old School leaders who, though sympathetic, were more accommodating of board structures. Thornwell pressed the issue as an implication of the **regulative principle**, arguing that the church cannot create a new standing office in effect, which boards become, without warrant of Christ’s institution. His stance shaped the DNA of the **Southern Presbyterian Church** formed in 1861, where the architecture of committees and church courts reflected his **jure divino** convictions. In his own mind, these were not administrative disputes but applications of **Christ’s headship** and the indivisible authority of Scripture to the concrete life of the church.

#### 4. The spirituality of the church and slavery: moral reasoning under pressure
Thornwell’s most consequential and contested theme is the **spirituality of the church**, a doctrine he deployed against ecclesial pronouncements on contested civil policies while affirming the church’s right to teach **moral law**. In the pamphlet **The Rights and Duties of Masters 1850** and the **Report on the Subject of Slavery to the General Assembly 1852**, he contended that the Bible nowhere condemns **slavery** per se as malum in se, that the apostolic directives regulate rather than abolish the institution, and that the church as church must not declare sinful what Scripture does not condemn. He insisted that the church should enforce the duties of masters and slaves according to **Pauline household codes**, preach the equality of persons in **union with Christ**, and anticipate gradual amelioration under the gospel. On this logic, to anathematize slaveholding as such was to exceed **ministerial and declarative** authority.

Thornwell’s spirituality doctrine also yielded a strong separation of spheres. In sermons and essays, crowned by **The Relation of the State to the Church 1853**, he argued that the state owes homage to **revealed religion** and should recognize Christianity as true, yet possesses no right of **jurisdiction in sacra**. The church, conversely, may teach all that Christ commands, including moral implications that touch public life, but must refrain from adjudicating civil policy questions that belong to magistrates. This two-spheres articulation, often compared to a Reformed **two-kingdoms** distinction, gained traction in the **Southern Presbyterian** ethos. Yet the same doctrinal architecture became the rationale by which Thornwell and his circle resisted abolitionist resolutions, treating them as invasions of the civil sphere and as hermeneutically unscriptural.

#### 5. Scripture, doctrine, and polemics: Old School orthodoxy codified
Doctrinally, Thornwell stood squarely in **Reformed orthodoxy**. He defended **verbal plenary inspiration** against rationalist and New School erosion, contended for **penal substitutionary atonement**, and articulated a strong **federal headship** in Adam and Christ. He opposed **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** dilutions of **original sin**, arguing for **immediate imputation** of Adam’s guilt alongside the transmission of corruption, and he tied justification to the **imputed righteousness** of Christ received by faith alone. In essays addressing **Albert Barnes** and other New School representatives, he argued that softening imputation dissolved the gospel. He held **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace** as the Spirit’s sovereign work, rejecting moral suasion accounts of conversion.

On the doctrine of Scripture, Thornwell treated the text as the fully trustworthy speech of God, logically coherent and historically sufficient. He frequently appealed to **autopistia** and internal marks of divinity, even as his **Common Sense Realism** coveted corroboration from the moral sense and historical testimony. The exegetical posture is consciously pre-critical, though he engaged emerging scholarship by distinguishing legitimate philology from **rationalist criticism**. As a polemicist, he supplied the Old School with compact arguments that wove **biblical exegesis**, **confessional proof-texting**, and **moral philosophy** into a single chord.

#### 6. Sacrament and worship: Calvin’s presence, covenant’s embrace
Thornwell’s sacramental theology tracks **John Calvin’s spiritual presence** and the **Westminster Standards**. The **Lord’s Supper** for him is not bare memorial but a means of grace in which the faithful, by the Spirit, feed on Christ’s body and blood truly though spiritually. He rejected **Zwinglian** reductions and **Tridentine transubstantiation**, presenting the Reformed middle as both realist and pneumatic. On **baptism**, Thornwell defended **infant baptism** as the sign of **covenant inclusion**, grounding the practice in the unity of the **Abrahamic covenant** and the church’s identity as the continuation of Israel’s covenant community under the new covenant. The efficacy of sacraments is tied to **union with Christ** and the **Spirit’s sovereign work**, not to ex opere or human intention.

In worship, Thornwell upheld the **regulative principle**, pressing for simplicity, biblical warrant, and the didactic function of ordinances. He wrote against innovations that lacked Scriptural authorization, treating the church’s liturgical practice as an arena of **Christ’s headship**. He saw catechesis under the **Shorter and Larger Catechisms** as the backbone of congregational formation. These sacramental and liturgical commitments were intimately connected to his ecclesiology, since the same **jure divino** logic governed polity and worship.

#### 7. Church and state in a time of war: establishment without Erastianism
In the crisis years of 1860 to 1862, Thornwell’s **church-state** reflections were tested by secession and war. He served as a chaplain to the **Confederate Congress** and helped shape the foundational documents of the **Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States**, later known as the PCUS. In the widely cited essay **The Relation of the State to the Church 1853**, he had argued that while the church’s power is spiritual, the state as God’s minister owes allegiance to the **moral law** and should acknowledge **Christianity** as true religion. He envisioned a species of establishment that repudiated **Erastianism**. The magistrate might protect the church and promote true religion in general terms, yet must not prescribe doctrine or interfere in ecclesiastical jurisdiction.

The Civil War sharpened these claims. Thornwell contended that secession was a civil and constitutional matter beyond the church’s competence to decide as church. Thus ecclesiastical bodies should not bind consciences on allegiance to Union or Confederacy. At the same time, he preached that both magistrates and citizens are accountable to **divine law**, that sins of the nation invite judgment, and that the church must call rulers to righteousness. The **spirituality of the church** again functioned as a check on ecclesial partisanship, even as critics noted that his own alignment with Southern nationalism and defense of **slaveholding** gave the doctrine a particular political edge.

#### 8. Interlocutors, legacy, and the tangled Southern inheritance
Thornwell’s immediate interlocutors included **Charles Hodge**, who agreed in principle on confessional orthodoxy but disagreed on the machinery of **boards** and the scope of church pronouncement, and **abolitionist divines** in the North who invoked the **moral law** against slavery. He contended with **New School** thinkers influenced by **Jonathan Edwards** and **Nathaniel W. Taylor**, contesting their doctrines of sin, virtue, and atonement. At home he collaborated with **Benjamin M. Palmer** and later influenced **R. L. Dabney** and **John L. Girardeau**, cementing a Southern Presbyterian idiom marked by **spirituality of the church**, **high Calvinism**, and **committee-based polity**. His sermons and essays were gathered in the **Collected Writings 1871–1873**, edited by Southern colleagues, securing his canonical status within the PCUS.

The legacy is starkly ambivalent. On the one hand stands a crystalline articulation of **ministerial and declarative** authority, a defense of **confessional orthodoxy**, and a coherent ecclesial critique of bureaucratic drift. On the other hand stands an egregious misjudgment on **slavery**, where exegesis, **natural law** claims, and spirituality rhetoric converged to shield a grave injustice. Later Southern Presbyterians pressed the **spirituality of the church** to avoid ecclesial engagement with **Jim Crow** and civil rights, revealing the doctrine’s capacity to be weaponized against prophetic witness. Yet others retrieved Thornwell’s institutional insights to defend the church’s distinct mission and worship against political capture. Contemporary Reformed discussions of **two-kingdoms** versus **transformationalist** paradigms still reckon with this Southern chapter of **Reformed ecclesiology**.

In a concise Reformed and WTS evaluation, Thornwell’s strengths include a robust **Scripture principle**, a careful account of **jure divino Presbyterianism**, and a salutary stress on the church’s **spiritual mission**. However, his reliance on **Common Sense Realism** and untutored **natural law** corrodes a self-consciously **biblico-theological** ethic, as emphasized by **Geerhardus Vos** and the redemptive-historical tradition. His use of spirituality to bracket the church’s moral voice on **slavery** betrays a failure to integrate the law and gospel in a **covenantal** and **eschatological** frame where the lordship of Christ claims every sphere without collapsing jurisdictions. A WTS alternative would affirm sphere distinction and **ministerial authority** while grounding public moral reasoning in **covenant theology**, **the antithesis** of regenerate and unregenerate mind, and a hermeneutic that reads the household codes through the **trajectory of redemption** toward new-creation justice. Such an alternative keeps the church from civil usurpation yet frees it to speak the whole counsel of God with prophetic clarity.
