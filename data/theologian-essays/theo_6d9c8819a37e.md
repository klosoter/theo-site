### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and intellectual posture
Michael S. Heiser, born in 1963 and deceased in 2023, emerged within late modern **evangelical scholarship** at a moment when **Ancient Near Eastern studies** and **Second Temple Judaism** were reshaping biblical interpretation. Trained in **Hebrew and Semitic Studies** at the **University of Wisconsin-Madison** with a 2004 PhD and earlier graduate work including an MA in **Ancient History** at **University of Pennsylvania**, he combined rigorous **Semitic philology** with a pastoral instinct born of the church. As a scholar-in-residence at **Logos/Faithlife**, host of the **Naked Bible Podcast**, and teacher across various institutions, Heiser pressed a single thesis: to read the Bible as its writers did, we must recover their **supernatural worldview** of a **divine council** under the unique sovereignty of Yahweh. The pivot figures are **Deuteronomy 32**, **Psalm 82**, **Job 1–2**, and **1 Kings 22**, framed by the **Dead Sea Scrolls** and **Septuagint**. His posture is confessional regarding **inspiration and inerrancy**, yet methodologically descriptive, resisting modern demythologizing of the **powers and principalities**.

Methodologically, Heiser is neither speculative nor systematic in the classical sense but insistently textual, prioritizing **textual criticism** and **lexical semantics**. The hermeneutical axiom is that **God inspired the Bible through human writers** in a concrete time and place; therefore, the Bible must be read with the **worldview of ancient Israel and early Judaism** in view. He repeatedly faults both conservative and liberal patterns that impose later **systematic theologies** or modern **naturalism** on the text, preferring **biblical theology** that traces conceptual development across the **canonical narrative**. Key to his method is the plural sense of **elohim** as a term for occupants of the spiritual realm rather than a name for the God of Israel, safeguarding **monotheism** through Yahweh’s **species uniqueness** and unrivaled attributes rather than through denial that other spiritual beings exist. By pressing the **DSS** reading of **Deuteronomy 32:8–9** and the **LXX**, he argues for a coherent **Deuteronomy 32 worldview** that underwrites the entire story line of Scripture.

#### 2. The Unseen Realm and the divine council frame
The founding synthesis appears in **The Unseen Realm** 2015, with a popular companion **Supernatural** 2015, where Heiser articulates the **divine council** as both the heavenly court of Yahweh and the interpretive key to the Bible’s supernatural claims. In **Psalm 82**, God stands in the midst of the **elohim** and judges them for unjust rule over the nations. In **Job 1–2**, the **sons of God** present themselves to Yahweh. In **1 Kings 22:19–23**, Yahweh deliberates with a heavenly host. None of this compromises **biblical monotheism** because Yahweh alone is uncreated, omnipotent, and sovereign, while other **elohim** are contingent creatures within the created spiritual realm. Heiser’s distinctive formulation, **monotheism by species uniqueness**, opposes both the reduction of the **gods** to mere **human judges** and any drift toward ontological **polytheism**. This framework frees the biblical text to say what it says while protecting **Creator-creature distinction** and Yahweh’s absolute **aseity**.

A centerpiece of the same work is the **Deuteronomy 32 worldview**. Following the **DSS** and **LXX** reading of Deut 32:8, Heiser contends that at **Babel** in **Genesis 11**, God disinherited the nations, allotting them to the oversight of rebellious **sons of God**, while electing **Israel** as Yahweh’s own portion. The subsequent **holy war** and **cosmic geography** in the Old Testament thus map a world of territorial **principalities** under judgment, with **Zion** as sacred space and rival high places such as **Bashan/Hermon** as loci of rebellion. This disinheritance frames the **Great Commission** and **Pentecost** as a reversal of Babel, as the multilingual proclamation of **Acts 2** breaks the grip of the **gods of the nations**. The macro-plot, therefore, is not only human sin and covenantal exile but also divine conflict culminating in the Messiah who reclaims the nations under the lordship of **Jesus Christ**.

#### 3. Triple rebellion and holistic redemption
Heiser integrates Old and New Testaments by way of a **triple rebellion** sequence. First, **Genesis 3** depicts the rebellion of the **nachash**, a throne guardian set within Eden’s sacred space, inciting human fall. Second, **Genesis 6:1–4** portrays the transgression of the **sons of God**, producing the **Nephilim**, which Heiser reads in continuity with **1 Enoch** and other **Second Temple** sources. Third, **Genesis 11** narrates human hubris at **Babel** and the divine parceling of the nations. Redemption, in turn, addresses all three: the cross resolves **human guilt** and **death**, the resurrection initiates new creation, and Christ’s exaltation disarms rebellious **powers** and reclaims geopolitical sacred space. In **Reversing Hermon** 2017, Heiser argues that several New Testament passages presuppose the **watchers** tradition of **1 Enoch**, especially **1 Peter 3:19–22**, **2 Peter 2:4**, and **Jude 6**, where the imprisonment of rebellious angels frames Jesus’ victory proclamation. This lens yields a thicker **Christus Victor** motif that complements juridical atonement and grounds the New Testament’s intense interest in **unclean spirits**.

Heiser’s reading of **Genesis 6** is emphatically anti-**Sethite**, insisting that the early Jewish and earliest Christian reception preserved the **angelic transgression** view. The spirits of the dead **Nephilim**, deprived of proper eschatological destiny, become the **unclean spirits** that plague humanity, a background that renders Jesus’ exorcisms intelligible as kingdom-announcing acts of rule. In this retelling, **baptism** in **1 Peter 3** is a ritual sign that also participates in Christ’s cosmic claim over the rebellious realm, an oath of allegiance to the now enthroned **Lord**. None of this confers canonical authority on **Enoch**, but it insists that the New Testament authors communicated within a **Second Temple** matrix and expected their readers to know the stories that informed their doctrinal idiom.

#### 4. Imaging God, sacred space, and the people of the council
Anthropology in Heiser’s system turns on the functional category of **imago Dei as imaging**. Humans are God’s **imagers**, vice-regents who participate in his rule and reflect his glory by representing him on earth. The point is not primarily psychological or structural substance but vocational participation in the mission of God’s **kingdom-temple**. This functional emphasis expands into a robust **theosis**-inflected glorification, where believers become like God in moral likeness and authority without breach of the **Creator-creature distinction**. The church as **new temple** in **1 Corinthians 3** and **Ephesians 2** becomes the extension of Edenic sacred space, while the **Spirit** marks the restored presence of God. For Heiser, ecclesiology thus entails **council participation**: in union with the risen Christ, the saints are enthroned and will judge **angels**, fulfilling the destiny originally granted to humanity.

The geography of holiness, or **cosmic geography**, supplements this anthropological vision. Places like **Hermon**, **Bashan**, **Zion**, and the wilderness are not incidental topography but theologically charged sites in a cosmic map. Jesus’ ministry in the Decapolis, his interaction with **Legion**, and the transfiguration on a mountain connected with **Hermon** dramatize the encroachment of the kingdom into enemy territory. Within this schema, **sacred space** is both spatial and communal, a domain cleansed by Christ’s authority and extended by the church’s mission. The upshot is a practical missiology that conceives evangelism and discipleship as the concrete advance of Yahweh’s reign against the **principalities and powers**, a program consistent with the **Great Commission** and the Pauline discourse on **thrones, dominions, rulers, and authorities**.

#### 5. Angels and demons as biblical taxonomy
Heiser’s handbooks, **Angels** 2018 and **Demons** 2020, turn to lexical taxonomy and narrative synthesis. The Hebrew **mal’ak** denotes a messenger role rather than an ontological species, while **elohim** functions as a placement word for entities of the spiritual realm. Heiser distinguishes the **divine council** from the broader host, maps the roles of **seraphim** and **cherubim** as throne guardians, and tracks the **Prince of Persia** and **Prince of Greece** in **Daniel 10** as evidence for territorial administration. He strongly resists conflating biblical demonology with later folkloric hierarchies, preferring the restrained **Second Temple** matrix in which **unclean spirits** are the disembodied dead of the **Nephilim**, while rebellious **sons of God** are incarcerated in **Tartarus** awaiting judgment, per **2 Peter 2:4**.

In these volumes, Heiser pursues a method that fuses **lexical semantics**, **intertextuality**, and **backgrounds** to generate a taxonomy that is neither speculative nor flattened by rationalist skepticism. He argues that the Bible’s own categories demand a real **unseen realm** with graduated authority structures, while every claim is tethered to textual data across **Torah**, **Prophets**, **Writings**, **Gospels**, and **Epistles**. The pastoral import is clear: spiritual warfare is normal Christian life under the lordship of **Christ**, not a sensational fringe. The ordinary means of grace, the **Word and sacrament**, and the discipled life enact the church’s embodied contest against the kingdom of darkness, a claim that aligns the **divine council** with Protestant spirituality while maintaining the integrity of **Sola Scriptura**.

#### 6. Two powers in heaven and Old Testament Christology
A second pillar of Heiser’s contribution is his account of **two powers in heaven** and early **high Christology**. Building on **Alan Segal**, **Richard Bauckham**, and **Larry Hurtado**, Heiser catalogs Old Testament patterns in which Yahweh is simultaneously present and yet distinguished within the same scene. The **Angel of Yahweh** bears the divine Name, receives worship, and speaks as Yahweh. The **Name theology** of **Exodus 23:20–23**, the **Word** and **Wisdom** personifications, and the **rider on the clouds** of **Daniel 7** converge in an intra-Yahwistic plurality that is not a contradiction but a pre-Christian binitarian template. For Heiser, the New Testament writers did not impose **Hellenistic metaphysics** onto the Hebrew Bible; they recognized that **Jesus** fits the second Yahweh pattern already present.

This claim stabilizes confessional **Trinitarian** dogma by rooting it in Israel’s Scriptures. While Heiser does not engage lengthy metaphysical treatments of **homoousios** or **processions** *ad intra*, he insists that the biblical authors invite and sustain the Christian confession of **the deity of Christ** and **Spirit** through their own narrative and liturgical logic. The canon’s high Christology thus controls the reading of unusual Old Testament texts, including **Genesis 18–19**, **Judges 13**, and enthronement passages in the **Psalms**, while cohering with a robust **Lordship** claim over the hostile powers. The early rabbinic backlash against **two powers** heresy is then explained as a post-Christian policing of theological boundaries once the church proclaimed Jesus as the second Yahweh.

#### 7. Dialogue with ANE and Second Temple scholarship
Heiser’s project lives in dialogue with major **ANE and Second Temple** scholars. From **Frank Moore Cross** and **Mark S. Smith** he appropriates the reality of Israel’s participation in a broader West Semitic cultic world, yet he rejects a genealogical reduction in which Israel’s God is merely an evolved **El** of Canaan. He affirms Cross’s and Smith’s **divine council** evidence while maintaining biblical **monotheism** by grounding Yahweh’s singularity in unrivaled attributes and rule. With **John Walton**, Heiser shares a vigorous **contextual hermeneutic** that resists modern anachronisms, but diverges when cosmic temple accounts are severed from concrete **spiritual beings** and **powers**. He aligns with **Bauckham** and **Hurtado** on **divine identity** and **devotional practice** as markers of high Christology, while pressing **Alan Segal’s** historical observation into an exegetical case for Old Testament plurality.

He also credits the **Enochic** tradition and **Second Temple** corpus as crucial background for New Testament authorship without granting those texts canonical status. The appeal to **1 Enoch** in **Reversing Hermon** is heuristic: to track the intertexts that NT writers assumed, in order to clarify why peculiar passages, such as **1 Peter 3** or **Jude**, speak the way they do. The result is a biblically thick account that repairs the modern deficit in spiritual ontology, counters both rationalist demythologizing and uneasy evangelical silence, and encourages careful, text-driven theological reasoning about the **unseen realm** under the supremacy of **Yahweh**.

#### 8. Influence, pedagogy, and ecclesial posture
Heiser’s influence is unusual because of his institutional location. Through **Logos Bible Software**, **Mobile Ed**, and the **Naked Bible Podcast**, he achieved broad catechetical reach while remaining tied to peer-reviewed **philology** and **text criticism**. Works like **The Bible Unfiltered** 2017 and **I Dare You Not to Bore Me with the Bible** 2014 popularize difficult themes like **Psalm 82**, **Deuteronomy 32**, and **cosmic geography** for the church. His habitual admonition is to let the Bible be as strange as it actually is and to resist domesticating its **supernatural worldview** in the name of respectability. At the same time, he polices the boundary of speculation, warning against quasi-occult fascinations and untethered **deliverance** practices, and calling readers back to the canonical story where **Christ’s lordship** structures the church’s holy warfare and its confidence in the **means of grace**.

His ecclesial posture remained broadly **evangelical**, with a clear affirmation of **inspiration**, **inerrancy** understood in ancient terms, and the uniqueness of **Jesus Christ** in salvation and lordship. Heiser did not write systematic monographs on **atonement models**, **justification**, or **sacramental theology**; nevertheless, his integration of **Christus Victor** with the **Great Commission** implicitly slots into broader **orthodox soteriology**. The lasting impression is a renewal of biblical imagination around **angels, demons, and the nations**, a demonstration that humility before the text in its own context yields doctrinal and pastoral fruit, and a reminder that the church’s confession flourishes when the **Old Testament** is allowed to say more, not less, about God and his **council**.

#### 9. Consolidation of themes and scholarly distinctives
What finally distinguishes Heiser is the synthesis of **divine council** ontology, **Deuteronomy 32** geopolitics, and **two powers** Christology into a single biblical-theological arc. The Bible’s plotline begins with Edenic **sacred space**, ruptured by a triad of rebellions, answered progressively through **Abrahamic election**, **covenantal** consolidation, and ultimately the **Messiah’s** enthronement over all earthly and heavenly powers. The church then lives as an outpost of the **new creation**, imaging God as a renewed **council people**, advancing into contested **cosmic geography** until the appearing of Christ. Theologically, this is a full-spectrum affirmation of the **unseen realm** ordered by the **Lord**, a validation of **principalities and powers** language in **Paul**, and a release from hermeneutical embarrassment that has often muted the spiritual density of Scripture. The scholarly tools remain those of **Semitic philology**, **textual criticism**, and **Second Temple** intertextuality.

Heiser’s death in 2023 cut short an expanding program that included teaching modules, accessible introductions, and continued consolidation of his **angelology** and **demonology**. Yet the core project is durable because it is not a novelty but a retrieval of neglected biblical data reframed within a coherent **monotheism**. By rehabilitating the category of **elohim** as a domain word and grounding Yahweh’s uniqueness in his incomparable **attributes** and **rule**, Heiser renders Israel’s talk of the **gods** intelligible, rescues **Psalm 82** from eisegetical evasions, and opens space for Old Testament **Christology** that coheres with later **Nicene** faith. His contribution is thus a retrieval for the church and a provocation for the academy to reconsider the conceptual furniture of the **Bible’s supernatural world**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** perspective, Heiser’s project offers major gains and exposes real tensions. Positively, the recovery of **divine council** and **Deuteronomy 32** frames enriches **biblical theology of kingdom and temple**, resonate with **Calvin’s** insistence on the Bible’s condescension to ancient idiom, and expand the cross’s cosmic scope in a way compatible with **Christus Victor** alongside **penal substitution**. His case for **two powers in heaven** strengthens Old Testament **Christology** in line with **Bauckham** and **Hurtado** and serves the confessional affirmation of **the Son’s deity**. His textual rigor in **DSS/LXX** readings, pastoral sobriety about the **unseen realm**, and insistence on **Sola Scriptura** as norm while using **Second Temple** literature as context are exemplary. The tensions arise chiefly in method and doctrinal integration. First, the functional emphasis on **imago Dei as imaging** can eclipse the Reformed focus on **original righteousness**, **federal headship**, and the forensic structure of **covenant theology**. Second, the **species language** for **elohim** risks muddling the **Creator-creature distinction** if untethered from classical affirmations of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**, though Heiser himself guards Yahweh’s uniqueness. Third, the heavy reliance on **Enochic** traditions as background, while often illuminating, can be over-weighted relative to the canonical center where **Scripture interprets Scripture** within the **covenants** of grace and works. Fourth, the cosmic-warfare lens may overshadow the redemptive-historical primacy of the **Abrahamic-Davidic-New** covenant trajectory that grounds ecclesial identity in **Word, sacrament, and discipline** rather than in mapping **cosmic geography**. A constructive Reformed alternative is not rejection but calibration: receive Heiser’s **divine council** insights as descriptive exegesis that populates the Bible’s **principalities** landscape, integrate them under covenantal structures controlled by **Christ’s mediatorial kingship**, and articulate the ontology of the **unseen realm** within classical **theism** so that the church retains both biblical strangeness and doctrinal stability.
