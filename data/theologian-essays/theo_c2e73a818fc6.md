### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, field, and method
Donna J. **Haraway** emerged from the dense intersections of **biology**, **feminism**, and **critical theory**, translating the languages of **technoscience** into tools for moral imagination. Born in 1944 in Denver and trained in **zoology** and **philosophy**, she completed a Yale PhD in 1972 on the metaphors driving **developmental biology**, later published as **Crystals, Fabrics, and Fields** in 1976. That early study already announced her abiding thesis: the scientific image of life is saturated with **figurative** and **political** commitments. Teaching at Johns Hopkins and then at UC Santa Cruz’s **History of Consciousness** program from 1980 situated her within late twentieth-century **STS** and **poststructuralism**, where **Foucault’s** analyses of **biopower**, **Latour’s** actor-network sensibilities, and feminist critiques of **objectivity** were redefining knowledge. This milieu is the soil of her claims about **situated knowledges**, **natureculture**, and **response-ability**. Theologically framed, Haraway is a theorist of creaturely limits in a world where **cybernetics** and **biocapital** have reorganized the conditions of life, turning metaphysical questions of **nature** and **person** into practical inquiries about alliances, entanglements, and care within mortal time.

#### 2. Situated knowledges and diffractive method
The essay **Situated Knowledges** 1988 declared a combative middle path between the godlike gaze of disembodied **objectivity** and the relativistic despair of anything-goes **constructivism**. Haraway names the false universal of the **god trick from nowhere** and argues for strong, accountable objectivity grounded in partial perspectives, embodied locations, and concrete alliances. Her method elevates **figuration** as a cognitive instrument: images such as the **cyborg**, **OncoMouse**, or **companion species** function as epistemic-laden myths that orient attention and ethical practice. She prefers **diffraction** to reflection, seeking patterns of difference that make a difference across **natureculture** couplings, a move later elaborated by **Karen Barad’s** agential realism and allied to **Isabelle Stengers’s** **cosmopolitics**. In **Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium** 1997 she refurbishes the early modern **modest witness** of **Robert Boyle** as an ironic figure for technoscientific testimony that takes responsibility for its own world-making. Methodologically, Haraway weds **semiotic** analysis to **material-semiotic** practice, refusing dualisms and urging *ad extra* accountability for how our descriptions compose the worlds they purport to report.

#### 3. The cyborg as political theology of bodies in technoscience
The seminal **A Cyborg Manifesto** 1985, reprinted in **Simians, Cyborgs, and Women** 1991, installs the **cyborg** as a condensed figure of material reality and imaginative politics. The cyborg marks three boundary collapses that structure modernity: human versus **animal**, organism versus **machine**, and physical versus **informational**. Haraway’s celebrated table of the **informatics of domination** tracks a historical shift from organic wholes to networked intensities, from **Fordist** production to flexible **post-Fordist** control. Against essentialist feminism, she proposes **affinity** rather than identity, coalition rather than essence, irony rather than purity. The cyborg is neither apocalyptic salvation nor technophobic doom but a call to craft alliances across heterogeneous parts under conditions of **biopower**. For theological anthropology, the cyborg unsettles inherited binaries of **mind-body**, **nature-grace**, and human **exceptionalism**, forcing fresh discourse on creaturely mediation, sacrament of the material, and the vulnerability of bodies entangled with code. The motif presses questions about **imago Dei** when the image is networked, prosthetic, and distributed, and it reframes **dominion** as the ethical governance of artifacts that have become intimate participants in life.

#### 4. Primate Visions and the critique of natural narratives
With **Primate Visions** 1989, Haraway excavates the cultural and gendered narratives embedded in **primatology**, re-reading fieldwork, laboratory practices, and popular representations of **apes** and **monkeys**. Figures like **Jane Goodall** dwell within stories of Edenic nature, maternal care, and evolutionary teleology that often reproduce Cold War anxieties and Western fantasies of **origin** and **order**. Haraway’s larger argument is that the human is always already **natureculture**, a suturing of biological kinship and semiotic projection. The book’s critical historiography troubles theological appeals to pristine **creation** or neutral **nature**, unmasking how origin stories carry imperial and gendered burdens. By showing how accounts of **cooperation**, **competition**, and **sexual selection** mirror social ideologies, she insists that knowledge of life is inescapably moral and political. The prominence of **semiotics** and **storytelling** here prepares her later emphasis on **SF** speculative fabulation and **string figures** as modes of more truthful telling, where truth is located in practices that enable flourishing among interdependent creatures rather than in a detached correspondence.

#### 5. Modest witness, biocapital, and technoscientific worlds
In **Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium. FemaleMan_Meets_OncoMouse** 1997, Haraway retools the early modern moral economy of witnessing, tracked by **Shapin and Schaffer**, for late modern regimes of **patent**, **brand**, and **venture capital**. The iconic **OncoMouse** TM, a transgenic research animal, becomes a figure for the complicated alliances of suffering, care, and profit in **biocapital**. Here Haraway develops an ethics of **response-ability**, a term signaling cultivated capacities to respond across species, technologies, and institutions. The focus on **modest witness** highlights how technoscientific testimony is always delegated, partial, and embodied, carrying irreducible obligations to those enrolled in its world-making projects. Theologically, the analysis interrogates modern **soteriologies** of cure and control, revealing hopes displaced onto biomedical innovation and corporate guardianship. The book also refines her **material-semiotic** method, demonstrating how discourse and device, metaphor and mouse, co-constitute the spaces in which life is valued, exchanged, and grieved. It marks a turn from simply critiquing epistemology to crafting practices of attention and care adequate to the lives bound within experimental systems.

#### 6. Companion species, becoming with, and multispecies ethics
By **The Companion Species Manifesto** 2003 and **When Species Meet** 2008, Haraway shifts from the cool chrome of the **cyborg** to the warm fur of **dogs**, elaborating **companion species** as a more grounded figuration of **becoming with**. She argues that humans and canines co-evolved through training, labor, affection, and mutual disciplining, thereby modeling the **sympoiesis** of many-worlds-making together rather than **autopoiesis** alone. Training becomes a moral pedagogy in which attention, play, and obedience cultivate **response-ability**. The **natureculture** of pets and livestock also exposes histories of **colonialism**, **eugenics**, and commodification, insisting that love is never innocent and that care requires accountability to lineages and land. For Christian ethics of **creation**, this is a substantial prompt to reconsider **dominion** as covenantal service, creaturely **finitude** as gift, and kinship with nonhuman neighbors as a practice of justice. The shift from cyborg to companion species does not abandon technology but shows how tools, genes, and gestures compose households of shared fate that demand prudence, gratitude, and lament.

#### 7. Staying with the Trouble and the Chthulucene
In **Staying with the Trouble** 2016, Haraway offers the **Chthulucene** as a counter-epochal name to the **Anthropocene** and **Capitalocene**. The term gathers tentacular, earthly, and chthonic agencies that exceed human control, invoking creatures like the spider **Pimoa cthulhu** to displace fantasies of mastery. The book’s practice is **SF** science fiction, speculative fabulation, string figures, science fact, and speculative feminism braided together to produce actionable stories. She commends **making kin not babies**, a provocation aimed at multispecies flourishing rather than demographic triumph, and commends **sympoiesis** as the metabolic law of life together. To stay with the trouble is to refuse apocalyptic cleansings and techno-fixes, choosing instead the hard craft of localized reparations, compost politics, and **response-ability** across generations. Theologically, the project presses eschatology down into patient **providence** within damaged time, trading rapture for **Sabbath** attentiveness to shared vulnerability, though without appeal to transcendent **grace**. It is a spirituality of immanent entanglement, a catechesis in limits, and a liturgy of mutual aid in a many-voiced creation.

#### 8. Interlocutors, technique, and theological proximities
Haraway’s conceptual apparatus resonates with and revises allied projects. With **Latour** she shares the redistribution of agency across **actant-networks**, while resisting a flat ontology by foregrounding obligations born of contact. With **Butler** she shares **performativity**, extended into interspecies training where bodies materialize through disciplined acts. With **Deleuze and Guattari** she shares **assemblage**, yet she tethers flight to care and work rather than to pure deterritorialization. With **Barad** and **Stengers** she shares **diffractive** and **cosmopolitical** sensibilities, while pressing fiction and figuration as cognitive tools that thicken worlds. Her engagements with **Whiteheadian** process metaphysics sit beneath the language of **becoming with** and **concrescence** without committing to a metaphysical system. For theology, Haraway’s **situated knowledges** challenge disembodied rationalisms, her **cyborg** revises body-soul binaries, her **companion species** intensifies creaturely communion, and her **Chthulucene** reorients ecological care. Yet she consistently refuses transcendence, formal **teleology**, or a creator **logos**, guarding immanence as the only scene of world-making and thereby relocating hope into distributed practices rather than into final redemption.

#### 9. Influence, contested receptions, and a Reformed evaluation
Haraway’s influence has been diffuse and potent across **STS**, environmental humanities, and religious studies, where theologians of **ecofeminism** and **posthuman theology** borrow **situated knowledges**, **companion species**, and **sympoiesis** to renew doctrines of **creation**, **sin** as structural entanglement, and embodied **ecclesiology**. Critics object that her mythopoesis risks romanticizing hybridity, that her **anti-essentialism** undercuts stable moral claims, and that her anti-transcendent **immanence** forecloses appeal to divine **judgment** and **grace**. A Reformed or WTS-style assessment highlights both contact points and principled limits. Positively, **covenantal epistemology** affirms finite, located knowers under **special revelation**, resonating with **situated knowledges** against the **god trick**; **common grace** authorizes learning from technoscientific neighbors, and the doctrine of **providence** grounds patient **response-ability** and craft. Yet classical Reformed teaching insists on the **Creator-creature distinction**, the **imago Dei** as covenantal office, and the **noetic effects of sin**, which exceed Haraway’s structural critique and require reconciliation through **Christ’s** mediatorial work. Her **natureculture** monism collapses analogical ontologies of **creation** into immanent webs, obscuring the goodness of nature as created order and the hope of **eschatological** renewal. A constructive alternative retains her summons to multispecies care and technological humility while locating accountability within the triune **covenant of grace**, reading creaturely kinship under the **Sabbath** and **dominion-as-service**, and situating diffractive practices within the church’s **Word-and-Sacrament** economy where mediation is finally secured not by the **cyborg** but by the incarnate **Logos**.
