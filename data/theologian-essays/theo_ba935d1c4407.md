### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Bobby Jamieson emerged as a pastor-theologian in the crucible of early twenty-first century evangelical renewal, where **9Marks** championed **regenerate church membership** and where the so-called **Young, Restless, and Reformed** movement pressed for catholic depth and ecclesial seriousness. He ministered at **Capitol Hill Baptist Church** in Washington, D.C., with **Mark Dever**, and pursued advanced study culminating in a PhD at **the University of Cambridge**, situating him within both congregational practice and the guild of **New Testament Christology**. His work moves along two rails, the first practical ecclesiology that insists **doctrine disciplines the church**, the second a rigorous engagement with **Hebrews** that retrieves **classical Christology**. This dual focus yields a pastoral scholarship in which **biblical theology** adjudicates practice and a close reading of texts, especially Hebrews, refines confession.

Jamieson’s method is best described as **grammatico-historical exegesis** governed by **canonical sensus plenior** without allegorical excess. He reads the **LXX Levitical cultus** as the indispensable horizon for Hebrews, tracking terms like *prosphero* offering, *teleioo* perfect, *ephapax* once-for-all, and *diatheke* covenant. His description of the atoning work of Christ is keyed to that cultic lexicon. In ecclesiology he proceeds by argumentative chains from **Matthew 16 and 18** on the **keys of the kingdom** and **binding and loosing**, to **1 Corinthians 5 and 11** on **discipline** and the **Lord’s Supper**. The result is an approach that binds **confessional identity** to an exegetical backbone, pledging loyalty to **credobaptist** readings of the **new covenant** and to the moral telos of **holiness**.

At the same time Jamieson is a retrieval theologian in a Baptist idiom. He receives **Chalcedon** and **Athanasius** on the **eternal Son** while drawing on **John Owen’s** robust account of priesthood in Hebrews, yet he refuses to let historical theology displace textual analysis. He argues that **2 Timothy 1:13** pattern-of-sound-words logic demands that **sound doctrine** be pastorally thick, and his 2013 book **Sound Doctrine** codifies the rule that orthodoxy must direct **discipleship** and **discipline**. This methodological marriage of exegesis and practice sets the stage for his two signature contributions, a credobaptist account of **membership and the ordinances** and a Hebrews-shaped account of **atonement and Sonship**.

#### 2. Credobaptist ecclesiology, ordinances, and the public shape of discipleship
Jamieson’s **Going Public** 2015 is a sustained case that **baptism** is the God-ordained boundary marker of the **new covenant community** and therefore a prerequisite for **church membership** and participation in the **Lord’s Supper**. He frames the issue by distinguishing the church’s two corporate acts under the **keys of the kingdom**. Baptism is the initiating sign by which a congregation publicly recognizes a credible professor as a **citizen of Christ’s kingdom**, while the Supper is the renewing sign by which the same congregation reaffirms that recognition through fenced participation. On this reading, to welcome an unbaptized professor into membership would be to dissolve the church’s God-given authority to bind and loose, a collapse of **regenerate church membership** into private judgment.

Historically, Jamieson engages **John Bunyan** and seventeenth-century debates among English Baptists on **open membership** and **open communion**. He argues that the pragmatic hospitality of **Bunyan** cannot trump **new covenant** exegesis, especially the apostolic order that places baptism prior to table fellowship in **Acts** and the catechetical logic of **Romans 6** and **Colossians 2**. He addresses modern proposals for admitting convinced **paedobaptists** to Baptist membership, including high-profile cases among the **New Calvinists**, and contends that such concessions contradict the **1689 Second London Confession** on the **ordinances**. The polemical edge is precise, not caustic, and repeatedly returns to **Matthew 28** and **discipleship** as a public, covenantal act.

In two short primers, **Understanding Baptism** 2016 and **Understanding the Lord’s Supper** 2016, he systematizes the constructive argument. Baptism is defined as the **initiatory oath-sign of union with Christ**, a visible word that the church administers as Christ’s embassy. The **Lord’s Supper** is the **renewal sign** of covenant communion, a corporate act that presupposes prior baptism and the church’s ongoing **discipline**. Exegetically, he leans on **1 Corinthians 10 to 11** to argue that the table is an ecclesial judgment seat where the body discerns the body. Pastorally, he links the ordinances to **assurance**, since a congregation’s recognition ratifies the credibility of profession. Theological payoff follows for **holiness** and **love**, as he first sketched in **Sound Doctrine**, since the ordinances are means by which a church teaches and guards the gospel.

#### 3. Atonement in Hebrews, the heavenly offering, and the unity of Christ’s priestly work
Jamieson’s academic centerpiece is **Jesus’ Death and Heavenly Offering in Hebrews** 2018, a monograph in the **SNTS** series that contends for a specific sequencing and integration in Hebrews’ account of **atonement**. The thesis is crisp. Christ’s **death** on earth is the sacrificial slaying, and his **entrance into heaven** is the high-priestly *prosphora*, the presentation and offering of that sacrifice in the true tent. The *ephapax* once-for-all is therefore not a moment that excludes movement but a single atoning event that extends from the cross to the throne, climaxing in **heavenly offering**. Terms like *eisodos* entry, *phanerosis* appearance, and *teleiosis* perfection anchor the claim that Hebrews locates cultic finality not at Golgotha alone but at the heavenly mercy seat that **Hebrews 9** names.

Interlocutors include **David Peterson**, who argues that Christ’s offering occurred on the cross, and **Harold Attridge**, who is cautious about literal cultic categories. Jamieson replies by charting the verbal clusters where Hebrews reserves offering language for what Jesus does upon entry, while sacrificial language is employed for the death. He then reads **Leviticus 16** typology to show that the Day of Atonement climaxes in blood presented within the sanctuary. He also engages **John Owen** on Hebrews, appreciating Owen’s instinct that the **ascension** belongs to priestly office while reframing the exact moment of cultic offering. The payoff is conceptual, since this model secures both **finality** and **heavenly efficacy** without multiplying sacrifices, and practical, since the church’s hope is anchored where Jesus is, within the veil.

#### 4. Son though he was, he learned obedience, the paradox resolved
The second major academic contribution, **The Paradox of Sonship** 2021, asks how **Hebrews** can affirm both **eternal Sonship** and **incarnational obedience**. Jamieson organizes the argument around two texts, **Hebrews 1** which exalts the Son as the radiance of God’s glory, and **Hebrews 5:8** which says that although he was a Son, he learned obedience through suffering. He defends **eternal generation** of the Son as the best rendering of Hebrews’ portrayal of filial identity, aligning with **Athanasius** and **Nicene** logic, then explains learning and perfection with **Chalcedonian** two-natures doctrine. Learning is predicated of the Son according to the assumed human nature, yet the subject is the one person of the **eternal Son**. The categories of *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia* clarify that the human nature has no independent personhood yet subsists in the Logos.

Jamieson also retrieves the **fittingness** motif of **Hebrews 2:10**, arguing that God’s wisdom orders the Son’s path to priesthood through obedient suffering so that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest. Perfection, *teleiosis*, names not moral improvement but vocational consecration to priestly office. This account puts pressure on any **EFS** style subordinationism by showing that Hebrews roots obedience in the incarnate economy, not in the eternal taxis of the Trinity. In the same movement it supports **divine immutability** and **impassibility** at the level of *ad intra* life, while acknowledging real human suffering *ad extra* in the Son’s assumed nature. The result is a classically Reformed and catholic Christology developed by a Baptist exegete of Hebrews.

A through line emerges across Jamieson’s corpus. The priestly Christ who perfects his people through a once-for-all death and **heavenly offering** forms a **holy people** who publicly own him in **baptism** and continue at his table under **discipline**. The ecclesial **keys of the kingdom** echo the Son’s authorized agency in heaven. The pattern of **sound doctrine**, to use the title of his 2013 book **Sound Doctrine**, binds **biblical theology** to congregational life. His writings model how detailed exegesis of **Hebrews** can recalibrate evangelical practice without collapsing into free-floating biblicism. A Cambridge dissertation can thus pastorally yield clearer lines around **membership**, **assurance**, and the **means of grace** understood as ordinances.

Jamieson’s intellectual company is revealing. On ecclesiology he stands with **Jonathan Leeman** and **9Marks** in stressing congregational authority under **Christ’s kingship**. On Hebrews he is in conversation with **Peterson**, **Attridge**, **Luke Timothy Johnson**, and **John Owen**, and he draws from biblical-theological figures like **D. A. Carson** and **Richard Bauckham** on canonical figuration. He frequently consolidates Baptist confessional resources, especially the **Second London Confession 1689**, to present **credobaptism** not as sectarian narrowness but as a coherent **new covenant** hermeneutic. His tone is confident yet churchly, insisting that theology terminates in **worship** and **discipleship**, not merely in academic debate.

The durability of Jamieson’s contribution will depend on the persuasive power of two claims. First, that the **new covenant** is coextensive with the **regenerate**, so that **baptism** must follow credible profession and precede **membership** and **table**. Second, that Hebrews’ language directs us to a **heavenly offering** as the climactic location of atonement’s efficacy, thereby securing both **finality** and **ongoing intercession** without bifurcating the priestly work. The first claim shores up **discipline** and **assurance** in Baptist congregations often tempted toward consumerist inclusion. The second clarifies **Christ’s priesthood** and reassures suffering saints that their hope is anchored where he appears for them before God.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation comes last because Jamieson’s work invites principled comparison. On **classical Christology**, his defense of **eternal generation**, **immutability**, and the **two-natures** grammar resonates with **confessional Reformed orthodoxy** and resists revisionist **EFS** currents. On Hebrews, many in the **Westminster** stream, following **Turretin** and **Owen**, distinguish the once-for-all **oblation** on the cross from Christ’s **heavenly intercession**, and some will worry that a strong **heavenly offering** idiom risks obscuring the cross as the singular site of **satisfaction** and the cry It is finished. Jamieson’s emphasis on a single extended event from cross to throne can be received if it safeguards the sufficiency of the cross and construes the heavenly phase as cultic presentation, not as a second atoning act. On the church, the divergence is structural. Westminster covenant theology identifies the **covenant of grace** across administrations and so defends **infant baptism** and a robust account of the **means of grace** as more than mere ordinances. Jamieson’s **credobaptist** delimitation of the **new covenant** to the regenerate and his structuring of **membership** and **table** by that delimitation will be judged a category error by Reformed paedobaptists. Yet Reformed readers can still profit from his tight exegesis of **Matthew 16 to 18** on the **keys**, his insistence that the **Supper** is a corporate act fenced by the church, and his relentless thesis that **sound doctrine** builds **holy churches**.
