### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Lewis Ayres, a British Roman Catholic theologian formed in the crucible of late twentieth-century **ressourcement** and early Christian studies, emerged as a principal voice in the retrieval of **pro-Nicene trinitarian theology** amid modern pressures to reimagine the Trinity in **social** or **economic** terms. Teaching first in the United States at Emory University and then from 2009 at Durham University, he placed patristic **historical theology** in living conversation with **systematic theology**, insisting that Christian doctrine is best grasped as a cultivated **habitus** rooted in **scriptural exegesis** and **ecclesial practice**. Methodologically he resists both abstract **metaphysical speculation** divorced from Scripture and reductionist **historicism** that treats doctrine as the mere byproduct of late antique politics. He commends a thick description of **doctrinal grammar**, the rules that govern Christian talk of God, with special emphasis on **divine simplicity**, **relations of origin**, and the **inseparable operations** of Father, Son, and Spirit.

Ayres writes within a Catholic world reshaped by **Dei Verbum**, the renewal of **patristic ressourcement**, and the contest between **Thomistic** and **Nouvelle Théologie** trajectories. Against the prevailing twentieth-century split between **Rahnerian** axioms and **social trinitarianism** inspired by **Moltmann** and **Jenson**, he advances a historically precise retrieval of **pro-Nicene** sources as the normative grammar of trinitarian confession. The goal is not antiquarianism but the rebuilding of **theologia** from **oikonomia**, a hermeneutic in which the one simple God known in the economy is the same one God confessed *ad intra*, and in which **participatory ontology** and **spiritual exegesis** purify the theologian’s intellect for contemplation.

#### 2. Nicaea and Its Legacy: the pro-Nicene thesis
The landmark monograph **Nicaea and Its Legacy**, 2004, reframed the fourth-century story by articulating **pro-Nicene theology** as a cross-regional, multilingual achievement in which Greek and Latin bishops converged upon a common **doctrinal grammar**. Ayres argues that by the 360s and 370s figures such as **Athanasius**, **Basil of Caesarea**, **Gregory of Nyssa**, **Gregory Nazianzen**, and **Hilary of Poitiers** forged a shared pattern: affirming **homoousios** as shorthand for real identity of **ousia** while carefully distinguishing **hypostaseis** by **relations of origin**; teaching **inseparable operations** that flow from the one **divine power**; and insisting that all **naming of God** rests on **divine simplicity** and **apophatic discipline**. This narrative corrects older historiographies that opposed Athanasian heroism to a monolithic **Arianism** and that misread **homoousios** as a blunt metaphysical club rather than a nuanced rule tied to exegesis of texts such as **John 1**, **John 5**, **Hebrews 1**, and **Proverbs 8**.

Crucial to Ayres’s construction is the claim that **doctrinal grammar** is grounded in **scriptural exegesis** shaped by the **rule of faith**. Pro-Nicene theologians advanced anti-Eunomian arguments from the incomprehensibility of **the divine essence**, defended **eternal generation** and **procession**, and tethered **inseparable operations** to the biblical missions of Son and Spirit. Ayres gives special weight to the anti-Eunomian insistence that names like **agennēsia** apply to the Father alone as a relational note, not as a predicate that differentiates divine essence, which remains numerically one. He thereby secures the unity of **will**, **power**, and **glory**, while explaining how biblical appropriation language assigns certain works to distinct persons without violating the rule of **indivisa sunt opera Trinitatis ad extra**.

#### 3. Against the de Régnon thesis and the rehabilitation of Augustine
A decisive thread in Ayres’s corpus is the demolition of the influential **de Régnon thesis**, the claim that Greek theologians began from **hypostasis** while Latin theologians began from **essence**, thus creating two divergent trinitarian paradigms. In **Augustine and the Trinity**, 2010, Ayres presents **Augustine** as a properly **pro-Nicene** theologian whose **De Trinitate** is not psychological speculation gone awry but a catechesis in reading Scripture toward the vision of the one God whose **inseparable operations** reveal distinct persons by their **relations of origin**. The famous triads of **memory**, **intellect**, and **will** are pedagogical devices that rehearse the rule of **divine simplicity** while training the reader in contemplative love. On Ayres’s account, Augustine’s asymmetrical emphasis on the **monarchia** of the Father as the source without source coheres with the Cappadocian account, and his insistence on one **divine essence** with one **will and power** parallels **Gregory of Nyssa** and **Basil**.

This rehabilitation also realigns Western reception of **Rahner’s Rule**. Ayres cautions that the formula the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity risks collapse into **historicist immanentism** if it is severed from the **pro-Nicene** insistence on **divine incomprehensibility** and **apophatic reserve**. By reading **Augustine** as a scriptural theologian who binds **economy** to **theology** by way of **relations of origin**, Ayres undermines modern East-West binaries and displaces modern attempts to ground personhood in social-relational categories. The result is a portrait of **Augustinian** trinitarianism that reaffirms **eternal generation**, **procession**, and **inseparable operations**, exposing as anachronistic any model that would divide nature and person into competing starting points.

#### 4. Scripture, exegesis, and ecclesial culture
Ayres’s Roman Catholic commitments surface in his account of **Scripture and Tradition**, not as rival authorities but as one **economy of revelation** in which **the canon**, **the rule of faith**, and **liturgical** and **ascetical** practices cultivate the capacity to read. He argues that pro-Nicene doctrine grew from a **theological culture** of **lectio**, **catechesis**, and **sacramental** participation, a culture that trained exegetes to perceive biblical patterns that secure **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**. Exegesis of **John 5** and **John 14** is exemplary: the Son does nothing from himself as from another power, yet whatever the Father does the Son does likewise, thereby revealing equality in **dynamis** and distinction by **filiation**. Ayres terms this a **participatory ontology**, within which contemplative purification enables recognition of both the unity of essence and the taxis of persons.

This hermeneutic bears on **dogmatics**. Ayres urges theologians to recover patristic **figural reading**, disciplined by **creedal** confession and by **negative theology** that refuses to transfer creaturely modalities to God. The aim is a **sapiential** theology that resists modern fragmentation. He faults both **biblicism** that abstracts from ecclesial habits and **metaphysical system-building** that neglects Scripture’s controlling language. In this sense **doctrinal development** is neither sheer innovation nor mere repetition, but the disciplined discovery of the grammar embedded in the **apostolic** scriptural witness.

#### 5. Doctrinal lines: simplicity, relations, missions, and the Spirit
Ayres’s constructive lines derive from his historical work. On **divine simplicity**, he follows pro-Nicene teachers who deny composition in God and thus deny any real distinction between **essence**, **attributes**, and **operations** in God *ad intra*. The persons are distinguished by **relations of origin** alone. On **inseparable operations**, he binds the axiom to the doctrine of **appropriation**: Scripture sometimes names the whole work by one person to manifest the order of origin, while maintaining one **power and will**. On **Christology**, Ayres aligns with fourth-century **dyophysite** trajectories by insisting that the Son’s **assumed humanity** is the locus of growth and suffering, not the divine **ousia**.

His treatment of **pneumatology** attempts a post-conflict reading of the **filioque**. He retrieves the patristic idiom that the Spirit proceeds from the Father **through the Son**, arguing that the Western **filioque** aims to secure the same **monarchia** of the Father while confessing the Son’s mediation in the Spirit’s eternal origin. The Spirit’s temporal mission manifests the eternal **procession**, again under the rule of **inseparable operations**. This line also guards against **subordinationism** and against modern Spirit-Christological inversions that dissolve **relations of origin** into economic roles.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates: against social trinitarianism and analytic simplifications
Ayres’s work is dialogical. With **Michel René Barnes** and **Khaled Anatolios**, he codified the category of **pro-Nicene theology** against narratives that overemphasized **Arianism** or posited East-West disjunctions. He debates **John Zizioulas** and **Jürgen Moltmann**, questioning whether a **communion ontology** or **trinitarian social model** can preserve **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations** without smuggling creaturely relations into the **theologia**. At the same time he finds allies in **Gilles Emery** and **Matthew Levering**, who share the Thomistic conviction that **relations of origin** name the persons and that **simplicity** is the bulwark of monotheism. With **Stephen Holmes**, whose The Quest for the Trinity in 2012 criticized modern trinitarianism, Ayres converges on the need to retrieve **classical trinitarian** rules, even when their emphases differ.

Regarding **analytic theology**, Ayres is cautious. Logical models of the Trinity may clarify consistency, yet he warns that such models risk abstracting from **biblical idiom**, **ascetical epistemology**, and the habit-forming force of **liturgy**. Pro-Nicene doctrine does not float free as a set of propositions but is embedded in a **sacramental** and **exegetical** life. Without this context, he contends, analyses of **relative identity** or **three-self** proposals drift toward **tritheism** or regress into a formalism that cannot account for **inseparable operations** and **relations of origin** as scripturally warranted.

#### 7. Augustine as schoolmaster of wisdom: pedagogy and contemplation
In expanding his Augustine project, Ayres highlights **De Trinitate** as pedagogical mystagogy. The ascent from the outer word to the inner word through **memory**, **intellect**, and **will** rehearses the pro-Nicene rules and trains readers in **charity** as the mode of divine knowledge. The epistemic humility of **apophatic theology** and the perseverance of **spiritual exegesis** mark Augustine as a master of **wisdom** rather than a speculative metaphysician. This portrait also reframes **theologia and oikonomia**. For Augustine, as Ayres reads him, the temporal missions of Son and Spirit manifest the eternal **relations of origin** and confirm **inseparable operations**. The end is participation in the one **simple** triune life by grace, an anticipation of **theosis** that remains faithful to Latin idiom without dissolving the **Creator-creature distinction**.

Ayres’s Augustine is thus a resource for contemporary **Catholic** dogmatics and for ecumenical dialogue. He reduces the polemical charge that Western theology smuggles a modalist essence behind the persons by showing that **Augustine** and the **Cappadocians** speak a common **pro-Nicene** language. He also reorients readers to the formative power of **liturgical time**, **creedal confession**, and **catechesis**, elements that sustain doctrinal stability and foster the exegetical habits from which **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations** are perceived as biblically obvious rather than speculative additions.

#### 8. Ecclesial location and the question of development
As a Roman Catholic, Ayres thinks within the horizon of **Tradition** as a living transmission under the guidance of the **magisterium**, yet his primary engine is the patristic synthesis itself. Development happens as the Church learns to read Scripture in ways consistent with **divine simplicity** and **relations of origin**, testing formulations against **creedal** norms and the ongoing life of **worship**. He resists readings in which development is the triumph of **metaphysics** over Scripture or of political power over **truth**, arguing that the fourth-century victory of **pro-Nicene theology** was a victory of interpretive wisdom over flattening literalism and over speculative literalism of the **Eunomian** sort. The upshot is a chastened **metaphysical realism**: the world participates in God without compromising **aseity**, and the Church participates in scriptural wisdom without eclipsing **revelation** with philosophical system.

Ayres’s ecclesial stance emerges too in his ecumenical handling of the **filioque** and **monarchia**. He reads the Western clause as a terminological hedge within the pro-Nicene account of **relations of origin**, open to convergence with the Eastern formula of procession **through the Son**. That proposal presupposes the primacy of **inseparable operations** and the refusal to divide **power** or **will** across the persons. It also underscores his conviction that dogmatic language is tethered to **liturgical** and **exegetical** practices, a conviction that frames his critique of both **biblicist** and **liberal** approaches to doctrinal change.

#### 9. Legacy and ongoing influence
The legacy of Ayres’s work is a reshaped field in which **pro-Nicene theology** functions as a regulative ideal for both historians and dogmaticians. The discipline of **historical theology** now more consistently treats fourth-century materials as a unified grammar rather than as a battlefield of incommensurable camps. In seminar rooms across Catholic and Protestant institutions, his accounts of **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and **relations of origin** have become the catechism of **classical trinitarianism**. His monographs and essays supply a framework within which scholars reassess **Athanasius** and the **Cappadocians**, reread **Augustine**, and critique modern **social trinitarian** and **Rahnerian** compressions of the doctrine.

This influence is not merely academic. Ayres’s insistence on **scriptural exegesis** within **ecclesial practice** has helped relocate trinitarian theology within the concrete life of the Church. His stress on **apophatic discipline** tempers theoretical overreach, while his retrieval of **participatory ontology** invites renewed attention to **theosis** as a biblically saturated soteriological horizon. The result is a stable platform from which to address contemporary challenges, whether ecological or political, without relinquishing the core **pro-Nicene** claims that anchor Christian confession in the one **simple**, **triune** God who acts indivisibly in creation and redemption.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and WTS vantage, Ayres’s retrieval of **pro-Nicene theology** is a major ally in defending **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **inseparable operations**, and **eternal generation** against modern revisionisms. His correction of the **de Régnon thesis** and his rehabilitation of **Augustine** bolster classic Reformed commitments to one **will**, one **power**, and to **relations of origin** as personal notes. Points of tension involve his Catholic appeal to **traditioned exegesis** and **magisterial** oversight, which a **sola Scriptura** stance would reframe as Scripture’s self-sufficiency under the **covenant** rather than as ecclesial habitus per se. Reformed readers will also scrutinize the weight he gives to **participatory ontology** and to **theosis**, preferring to speak of **union with Christ** under the federal **covenant** to guard the **Creator-creature distinction**. Finally, his accent on the **monarchia** of the Father invites careful alignment with **Calvin’s autotheos**, which the Reformed orthodox harmonized with **eternal generation** by distinguishing essence and person. A confessional Reformed appropriation should receive Ayres’s **pro-Nicene grammar** and **inseparable operations** in full, while transposing his **Scripture-and-Tradition** claims into a robust **Scripture-principle** and reframing **participation** in the idiom of **covenantal union**.
