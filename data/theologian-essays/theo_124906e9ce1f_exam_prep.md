### TITLE
Paul Tillich offers a brilliant but deeply corrosive synthesis in which **being-itself** replaces the personal **triune God**, and symbolic **correlation** displaces the Reformed Word-revelation.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Early twentieth-century **Paul Tillich** (1886–1965) develops his thought amid **German Idealism**, **existentialism**, and the cultural trauma of World War I and II.
- His mature work unfolds in the context of **Weimar crisis**, exile from Nazi Germany in 1933, and later teaching in the United States at **Union Theological Seminary** and **Harvard**.

- Tillichs method is an explicit **method of correlation**, correlating existential questions of culture with theological answers grounded in symbols of **Christian faith**.
- For Tillich, **revelation** is not a set of propositions but an event disclosing mans ultimate concern, mediated through **symbolic language** and cultural forms.
- He privileges **philosophy and existential analysis** as preparation for theology, while treating **Scripture and dogma** as historically conditioned symbols which point to the ground of being.

- In **The Protestant Era** (1948) Tillich articulates the **Protestant principle**, a critical principle whereby every finite form of religion is subject to judgment by the unconditional.
- In **Systematic Theology I–III** (1951–63) he develops his ontology of **being-itself**, his doctrine of **God above the God of theism**, and his correlation of reason and revelation.
- In **The Courage to Be** (1952) he analyzes anxiety and non-being, arguing that true courage rests in participation in **being-itself** rather than in a personal Redeemer.
- In **Dynamics of Faith** (1957) he defines **faith** as ultimate concern and unpacks religious symbols as finite expressions of the infinite, subject to demythologizing critique.

- Tillich is decisive for loci of **revelation and Scripture**, recasting revelation as symbolic event rather than inspired, inerrant Word.
- He is central for **doctrine of God**, redefining God as **ground of being** rather than as personal, self-contained triune Lord.
- He is influential for **Christology and soteriology**, where Christ is the New Being that conquers estrangement rather than the covenant Mediator bearing penal substitution.
- He is a major voice in **church and culture**, arguing for theology through cultural analysis and the presence of the holy in secular realities.

- A Westminster candidate must show that Tillichs **symbolic correlation** method fundamentally clashes with **sola Scriptura** and with a covenantal, personal doctrine of God.
- The examiner will expect you to appreciate Tillichs cultural and existential insight while clearly rejecting his **doctrine of God**, view of **revelation**, and weak historical **resurrection**.

- For comparison, place **Tillich vs Barth** on revelation and the Word of God, contrasting symbolic correlation with Barth’s actualistic self-revelation in Christ and Scripture.
- Also contrast **Tillich vs Van Til**, with Van Til defending the self-attesting triune **Lord** over against Tillich’s **ground of being** rooted in ontological correlation.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Paul **Tillich** was born in 1886 in Starzeddel in Brandenburg and raised as the son of a Lutheran pastor, formed by the intellectual climate of late **nineteenth‑century German Idealism** and emerging **historical criticism**. He studied theology and philosophy in Berlin, Tübingen, Halle, and Breslau, absorbing **Kant**, **Hegel**, **Schelling**, and the early **existentialists**. Ordained in the Prussian Union Church in 1912, he served as a chaplain in World War I, where the horrors of the front and the collapse of the **Wilhelmine** order left a permanent impression. The postwar Weimar period, with its cultural disintegration and search for meaning, provided the crucible in which Tillich developed his early religious socialism and his conviction that theology must speak to the **existential crises** of its age.

In the 1920s Tillich held university posts at **Berlin**, **Marburg**, Dresden, and Frankfurt, working alongside figures such as **Rudolf Otto** and engaging **Martin Heidegger** and **Karl Barth** as conversation partners and foils. His political resistance to **National Socialism** led to his dismissal from German academia in 1933 and subsequent emigration to the United States, where he taught at **Union Theological Seminary** in New York with **Reinhold Niebuhr**, later at Harvard and the University of Chicago. This bilingual and bicultural setting sharpened his ambition to shape a comprehensive **Systematic Theology** capable of addressing both European metaphysical questions and American pragmatic concerns.

The driving problem Tillich sought to solve can be stated simply: how can the Christian message be both intellectually credible and existentially meaningful in a secular, scientifically informed culture after the collapse of traditional **metaphysics** and the rise of historicism and existential anxiety. Tillich believed that both **orthodox confessionalism** and liberal **culture-Protestantism** had failed: the former by clinging to precritical dogma that no longer communicated, the latter by reducing Christianity to ethics or religious feeling. His answer was to construct a theology that would correlate the **questions** posed by philosophy, psychology, and culture with the **answers** provided by the symbols of Christian faith, interpreted through a new **ontology of being and non-being**.

A further dimension of his problem was explicitly anti-fundamentalist and anti-traditionalist. Tillich feared that, if theology insisted on propositional inerrancy and a naive personal theism, the modern mind would rightly reject Christianity. He therefore set out, especially in **The Protestant Era** and **Dynamics of Faith**, to articulate a **Protestant principle** of radical self-critique, according to which every finite religious form, including Scripture and church, must be relativized by the **unconditional** to which they only symbolically point. In doing this he aimed to save what he took to be the essence of **Christian revelation** by translating it into an ontology of **ultimate concern** and **ground of being**.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Tillich is best understood as a methodological theologian whose core contribution is his **method of correlation**, elaborated in **Systematic Theology I**. There he insists that theology must not begin from an external authority such as an inspired **Bible** in the Reformed sense, nor from confessional propositions, but from a careful analysis of the questions latent in human existence: anxiety, finitude, guilt, meaninglessness. These questions are disclosed by **philosophy, psychoanalysis, and cultural critique**, and they determine the form in which theology must present its answers. Theology then seeks within the symbols of **Christian faith** the answers that adequately correlate with those questions. The relation between existential questions and revelatory answers is dialectical; theology is always in motion between them.

For Tillich, **revelation** is neither primarily historical narrative nor verbal inspiration but an event in which the **ground of being** breaks through into finite consciousness, producing an experience of being ultimately concerned. Revelation occurs in history and through finite media, yet its content is not propositional information but the manifestation of the **New Being** that heals estrangement. Tillich speaks of revelation as an **ecstatic** event, where reason is taken beyond itself, yet he refuses to call it irrational; it is instead the fulfillment of the deepest longings of **reason**. This stands in explicit tension with classical Reformed views, for which revelation is chiefly the triune Gods self-disclosure in **the history of redemption** and in the canonical Scriptures as a sufficient, coherent body of truth.

Tillichs view of **reason** is shaped by German Idealism and existentialism. Reason is finite, conditioned, and fragmentary, yet it has an inherent **ontological structure** that participates in the structure of being. Hence reason is capable of asking ultimate questions and receiving revelatory answers, but whenever it attempts to grasp the **unconditioned** as an object it falls into idolatry. The proper mode of theological language is therefore **symbolic** rather than literal. Symbols participate in the reality to which they point, yet they are not identical with it; they must eventually be broken and transcended. This symbolic view of doctrine underlies his readiness to reinterpret classic dogmas such as **Trinity** and **incarnation** as ontological rather than historical claims, which Reformed theology, following **Calvin** and **Bavinck**, would regard as a departure from the clarity and sufficiency of the Biblical text.

The church and its **tradition** function in Tillichs method as historical bearers of revelatory symbols, not as a normative magisterium in the confessional Protestant sense. Creeds and confessions are historically significant attempts to express the encounter with the **New Being** in changing conceptual frameworks. They therefore possess no fixed, binding authority and must be continuously reinterpreted according to the questions of each epoch. Scripture is the norming norm only in a highly attenuated sense: it is the foundational symbol of the Christian community, but its narratives and propositions must be subjected to historical criticism and ontological reinterpretation. This sharply diverges from the Reformed **sola Scriptura** principle, clarified by **Westminster Confession** 1, in which Scripture is the inspired, sufficient, and perspicuous Word of the triune God to the church.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, on **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is that revelation is the self-disclosure of the triune God in the history of creation and redemption, consummated in **Jesus Christ** and inscripturated by the Spirit in the prophetic and apostolic **Scriptures**, which are verbally inspired and inerrant in all they affirm. Tillich, by contrast, regards revelation as the manifestation of the **ground of being** in finite existence, an event that shatters ordinary experience and discloses the unconditional. In **Systematic Theology I** and **Dynamics of Faith**, he insists that Biblical texts are human responses to such revelatory events, framed in symbolic and mythic language that must be demythologized and correlated with present existential questions. He aligns himself in some respects with **Bultmann** in treating myth as necessary but surpassable form. The authority of Scripture thus lies in its power to mediate an encounter with the ultimate, not in an inerrant content. From a Reformed standpoint following **Warfield** or **Van Til**, this unmoors theology from a stable canon and makes the criterion of truth an experienced correlation rather than Gods own speech.

Second, in the **doctrine of God**, the confessional baseline is that God is the living, personal, simple, immutable, infinite, and triune Lord, existing a se and distinct from the creation, who freely creates, sustains, and governs all things, as articulated in the **Nicene** and **Reformed scholastic** tradition. Tillich famously rejects what he calls the God of **theism**, by which he means any conception of God as a highest being alongside other beings, however exalted. In **Systematic Theology I** and in essays such as the 1946 lecture on the **God above God**, he defines God as **being-itself** or the **ground of being**, the power of being that resists non-being. Personal predicates when applied to God are for Tillich symbolic expressions of the depth of being, not literal descriptions of a divine subject. Traditional attributes are reinterpreted as ontological structures rather than perfections of a living Lord. Tillich contends that this move rescues the divine from objectification and idolatry, while critics like **Barth** and later **Van Til** object that it dissolves the Creator-creature distinction, undermines Gods personal lordship, and leaves us with an impersonal absolute more akin to **Schelling** than to the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

Third, in **Christology and soteriology**, the classic Reformed confession is that **Jesus Christ**, true God and true man in one person, accomplishes redemption through his once-for-all obedience, atoning death, and bodily resurrection, as the covenant mediator and surety whose righteousness is imputed to believers. Tillich, however, treats **Christ** primarily as the bearer of the **New Being** in whom the estrangement between essence and existence is overcome. In **Systematic Theology II** and in **The New Being** sermons, he portrays Jesus not chiefly as a historical figure whose resurrection can be verified, but as the decisive symbol and event in which the power of being itself conquers non-being. The cross is the symbol of the participation of the ground of being in the abyss of non-being; the resurrection is the symbol of the victory of being over non-being within history. Influenced by liberal tradition from **Harnack** onward, Tillich downplays forensic categories such as penal **substitution** and justification, speaking instead of acceptance in spite of rejection and the healing of existential estrangement. Interlocutors such as **Oscar Cullmann** and orthodox Lutherans accused Tillich of evacuating Christology of its historical concreteness; Reformed theology would insist that without a real, personal, and historical Mediator, the gospel collapses into ontology.

Fourth, regarding **church and culture**, the Reformed baseline views the church as the visible and invisible people of God, gathered around the Word and sacraments as means of grace, set apart from the world yet sent into it as witness under the Lordship of Christ. Tillichs ecclesiology, by contrast, is thin and functional. In **The Protestant Era** and **Systematic Theology III**, he treats the church as the bearer of the Christian **symbol system** within the broader **Spiritual Community** that includes all manifestations of the holy in culture, art, and politics. His celebrated **Protestant principle** insists that every concrete church form is subject to radical critique by the unconditional, which prevents idolatrous absolutizing of institutions. He thus advocates a theology of culture in which art, politics, and secular movements can be sites of revelation, sometimes more than institutional church life. While Reformed thinkers like **Vos** and **Kuyper** affirm that Christ is Lord over all of life and that common grace is active in culture, they would sharply distinguish general from special grace and insist on the unique role of the visible church and ordained means of grace in Gods saving work, a distinction Tillich blurs.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians such as **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** would have found Tillichs starting point and method deeply problematic. Calvin insists in the **Institutes** that true knowledge of God begins with Gods own self-disclosure in creation and Scripture, not with the autonomous search of human consciousness. Turretin defends the **cognitive clarity** of Scripture and the propositional character of dogma against any reduction to mere symbol. Bavinck stresses the organic unity of revelation, centering in the person and work of **Christ** as narrated in canonical history. In contrast, Tillich begins from existential analysis, treats Scripture as historically conditioned symbol, and proposes an ontological framework in which God as **being-itself** is known indirectly through the structure of our questions.

From a Westminster vantage point, at least two major objections are unavoidable. First, Tillichs doctrine of **God** fails to preserve the personal, covenantal Lord who speaks, promises, and judges. By collapsing God into the **ground of being**, he undermines the Creator-creature distinction and evacuates the Biblical narrative of a living God who acts in history. Second, his view of **revelation and Scripture** denies the verbal inspiration and inerrancy of the Bible, substituting a fluid, symbolic hermeneutic whose norm is existential adequacy rather than divine authority, in direct conflict with the **Westminster Standards** and with the apologetic stance of **Van Til**.

Yet there are limited points where Reformed theologians can learn from Tillich. His insistence, in **The Protestant Era**, on the **Protestant principle** as a warning against absolutizing any finite church form can enrich Reformed self-critique and guard against ecclesial idolatry, in line with Calvin’s stress on the perpetual need for reformation. His sensitivity to **existential anxiety**, guilt, and meaninglessness, as in **The Courage to Be**, can sharpen our pastoral and homiletical awareness of how the gospel addresses the modern heart, even if we would ground our answers not in ontology but in Christ’s historical cross and resurrection. Later Reformed thinkers engaging culture, such as **Tim Keller**, indirectly benefit from some of Tillichs instincts about translation into contemporary questions, while firmly rejecting his theological foundations.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, a safe opening sentence would say that **Paul Tillich** is a twentieth‑century German-American **liberal** systematic theologian best known for his method of correlation and his definition of God as **being-itself** rather than a highest personal being. It is also safe to say that he attempts to make Christian theology intelligible to modern secular culture by correlating existential questions with symbolic answers drawn from the Christian tradition. You can affirm that he offers a profound analysis of **anxiety, estrangement, and meaninglessness**, and that he insists the church must continually criticize its own forms in light of the gospel, while quickly adding that his understanding of gospel and God fundamentally diverges from Reformed orthodoxy.

Certain phrases must be used with caution, clearly qualified. If you repeat Tillichs formula **God above the God of theism**, you must immediately clarify that from a Reformed perspective this wrongly identifies the Biblical personal God with a finite object of thought and then replaces him with an impersonal **ground of being**. You should avoid unqualified endorsement of terms like **myth** and **symbol** for Scripture; instead, explain that Tillich sees doctrines and Biblical narratives as symbols that participate in but are not identical with the divine reality, whereas Reformed theology insists that while language is analogical, Scripture truly and reliably speaks Gods own words. Do not allow **being-itself** or **ultimate concern** to stand as if compatible with classical theism; mark clearly that they are part of an ontological scheme that rejects the Creator-creature relation as confessionally understood.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings about Tillich. One common student error is to assume he is simply a warmer or more existential **Barth**; you must stress that Barth insists on a sovereign God who freely speaks his Word in **Jesus Christ and Scripture**, while Tillich operates with an ontological correlation in which God and world are internally related. Another pitfall is to treat Tillichs language about the **New Being** as if it presupposed orthodox Chalcedonian **Christology**; in fact he reinterprets incarnation as a symbolic expression of the overcoming of estrangement rather than the assumption of concrete human nature by the eternal Son. A third mistake is to say that Tillich affirms or denies specific doctrines like the bodily **resurrection** in straightforward fashion. You must explain that he tends to translate such claims into existential symbols, which in practice functions as denial from a confessional standpoint. Finally, avoid praising his **method of correlation** without immediately stating that Reformed theology can only engage correlation from within the normative framework of **sola Scriptura** and the self-attesting triune Lord, not as an independent philosophical starting point.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, one can affirm in **Tillich** his seriousness about theology addressing the real **existential questions** of modern people, his protest against ecclesial idolatry in the **Protestant principle**, and his recognition that all human God-talk is analogical and conditioned. Yet one must firmly deny as non-negotiable his redefinition of **God** as being-itself rather than the personal, covenant Lord, his reduction of **revelation and Scripture** to symbolic mediations governed by existential adequacy rather than divine authority, and his transformation of **Christology and atonement** into ontological healing language rather than the once-for-all, substitutionary work of the incarnate Son. If asked where I land, I would say that Tillich is a brilliant diagnostician of secular anxiety and a powerful stimulus for thinking about theology and culture, but that his entire system is built on a rejection of classical theism and Biblical revelation, so that a Reformed theologian can only appropriate his insights selectively and critically, while standing instead with **Calvin, Bavinck, and Van Til** on the self-attesting triune God who speaks in Christ and the canonical Scriptures.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Paul **Tillich** is a twentieth-century German-American liberal systematic theologian who sought to make Christianity credible to modern culture through his method of correlation and his doctrine of God as **being-itself**.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1886 in Germany, dismissed by the Nazis in 1933, Tillich taught at **Union**, **Harvard**, and Chicago, dying in 1965.
- His three-volume **Systematic Theology** (1951–63) is his mature exposition of God as **ground of being**, revelation, Christ, and culture.
- Key shorter works like **The Protestant Era** (1948), **The Courage to Be** (1952), and **Dynamics of Faith** (1957) popularize his ideas of the **Protestant principle**, anxiety, and ultimate concern.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Tillichs **method of correlation** starts from existential questions disclosed by philosophy and culture and then seeks theological answers within Christian symbols.
- He treats **revelation** as an event in which the ground of being breaks into consciousness, mediated symbolically rather than as verbal inerrant propositions.
- **Scripture**, creeds, and church tradition are historically conditioned symbols that must be critically reinterpreted rather than fixed authorities.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Tillich defines **God** as **being-itself** or the ground of being, rejecting the personal God of classical **theism** as a highest being among others.
- He views **revelation and Scripture** as symbolic breakthroughs of the unconditional into finite existence, subject to demythologizing and correlation.
- His **Christology** presents Christ as bearer of the **New Being** who overcomes estrangement, with cross and resurrection as existential symbols rather than strictly historical-redemptive events.
- In **soteriology** he replaces forensic justification with healing of ontological estrangement and acceptance in spite of rejection, minimizing penal **substitution**.
- His **Protestant principle** insists that every finite religious form, including church and doctrine, is under the critical judgment of the unconditional.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- A Westminster examiner will press that Tillichs view of **God as being-itself** undermines the personal, covenantal, triune Lord of Reformed **classical theism**.
- His doctrine of **revelation and Scripture** explicitly denies verbal inspiration and inerrancy, replacing them with symbolic, existential adequacy.
- Tillichs **Christology and resurrection** dissolve historical specificity into symbols of New Being, in conflict with Reformed insistence on the real, bodily resurrection and penal atonement.
- His expansive theology of **church and culture** blurs the line between general and special revelation and weakens the unique role of the visible church and means of grace.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Tillich vs Barth** on revelation, with Barth centering Gods free self-speaking in Christ and Scripture and Tillich centering ontological correlation and symbol.
- **Tillich vs Van Til** on God, with Van Til defending the self-contained triune **Lord** over against Tillichs impersonal **ground of being**.
- **Tillich vs Schleiermacher** on method, with Schleiermacher grounding theology in *Gefühl* of absolute dependence and Tillich in existential ontology and ultimate concern.
- **Tillich vs Bavinck** on Scripture and dogma, with Bavinck affirming organic, inspired revelation and Tillich insisting on historically conditioned, revisable symbols.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Tillich is a penetrating analyst of modern anxiety and culture whose ontology of **being-itself** and symbolic correlation, however, represents a systematic rejection of the Reformed confession of the personal triune God who speaks in Christ and the canonical Scriptures.
