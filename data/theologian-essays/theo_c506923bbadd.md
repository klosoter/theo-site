### ESSAY
#### 1. Setting and formation in the Pelagian crisis
Julian of Eclanum, born c. 386 and dying c. 454, emerges as the most articulate Latin defender of **Pelagian anthropology** after the condemnations of **Pelagius** and **Celestius**. Elevated as bishop of **Eclanum** in Campania in 417, he refused in 418 to sign the African formula condemning Pelagius without due process, which set him against **Pope Zosimus** and the **Councils of Carthage** that codified **original sin** and the necessity of **grace**. Deposed and exiled, Julian carried the debate from Italy to the Greek East, where he found limited hospitality among Antiochene theologians such as **Theodore of Mopsuestia** and among imperial circles in **Constantinople**, before being expelled at the instigation of **Marius Mercator**. His last years were spent likely in Sicily, still writing against **Augustine**, whose doctrine of **concupiscence** and **massa peccati** he considered a recrudescence of **Manichaeism**.

The historical tension in which Julian worked was precisely defined by the collision of **Augustinian grace** and **Pelagian freedom** under the shadow of anti-dualist apologetics. His ecclesial identity as a married bishop and his intellectual network across Latin and Greek Christianity gave him a vantage point from which to challenge Africa’s emerging consensus. The archival remains of his thought survive mainly through the quotations embedded in **Augustine’s Contra Iulianum** 421–422 and the later **Opus imperfectum contra Iulianum** 429–430, as well as the dossiers compiled by **Mercator**. From these sources a coherent portrait emerges of Julian’s confidence in **nature’s integrity** and **volitional responsibility**.

#### 2. Method, scripture, and anti-dualist posture
Julian’s method can be characterized as literal-historical **exegesis** married to a moral-rational account of **human agency**. He reads **Romans 5** according to the Greek causal construction *eph ho*, insisting that death spread to all because all actually sin, not because of **imputation** or hereditary **culpa**. For him **liberum arbitrium** remains a creational endowment that is neither destroyed by Adam’s fall nor incapacitated by **concupiscence**. This exegetical stance is coupled with a relentless anti-dualist polemic. To call sexual desire itself sinful is, in Julian’s judgment, to impugn **God’s creative goodness**, an error perilously close to **Manichaean dualism** where matter is suspected and procreation is an evil.

Intellectually, Julian privileges the **order of nature** as positively willed by God and thus a reliable starting point for ethics. He views **gratia** primarily as divine teaching, law, and sacramental aid rather than an internal, transforming infusion. He thus frames soteriology through the categories of **exemplar** and **moral formation**, drawing on Latin and Greek precedents that emphasize human responsibility under the **lex** and under the **evangelium**.

#### 3. Corpus and controversy
Although no complete treatise of Julian survives under his own name, the outlines of several works can be reconstructed. The **Ad Florum** c. 419 defended **Pelagius** against charges of fatalism and denial of grace. The **Ad Turbantium** c. 421 argued for the **bonum nuptiarum** and against **concupiscence** as intrinsic sin, thereby provoking **Augustine’s De nuptiis et concupiscentia** 419–420 and the first **Contra Iulianum** 421–422. His magnum opus, the **Contra Augustinum libri VIII** c. 429, elicited **Augustine’s Opus imperfectum contra Iulianum** 429–430, unfinished at Augustine’s death in 430. These exchanges revolved around a tight cluster of loci: **creation**, **marriage**, **sin**, **free will**, and **grace**.

Ecclesiastically, Julian’s resistance intersected with synodical and imperial acts. The **African Code of 418** and Roman confirmations under **Boniface I** established penalties for refusing the anti-Pelagian formulae, while the **Council of Ephesus 431** reiterated condemnations of **Celestius** and those holding similar views. Julian’s engagements in the East intersected with the Antiochene school, especially **Theodore of Mopsuestia**, whose optimism about **human nature** and insistence on **synergy** resonated with Julian’s agenda. Julian framed his cause as the defense of **catholic doctrine** against novel Augustinianism and against latent **Manichaeism**, an accusation that Augustine energetically repudiated.

#### 4. Creation, marriage, and concupiscence
Central to Julian’s thought is a vigorous doctrine of **creatio bona**. God created the body and its appetites as good, including **sexual desire**. The institution of **marriage** serves noble and holy ends, summarized as **bonum prolis**, **bonum fidei**, and **bonum sacramenti**. Against **Augustine’s** claim that the postlapsarian **libido** contaminates every conjugal act and is a remaining fault even in the regenerate, Julian insists that **concupiscence** is a natural movement which is morally indifferent until governed or disordered by the will. To call the spontaneous stirrings of sexual appetite sin is, in Julian’s rhetoric, to blaspheme the **Creator** and to import a **dualistic** disdain for embodiment.

His **De nuptiis** arguments, reconstructed from Augustine’s citations, press the point that sacramental marriage cannot be intrinsically stained by a congenital moral fault. For Julian the vice lies not in the *motus carnis* but in the consent of the will to inordinate indulgence, which can and should be avoided by **virtue** and **discipline**. The debate over concupiscence thus became a proxy for larger questions about **original sin**, **infant baptism**, and the structure of **grace**.

#### 5. Sin, guilt, and the interpretation of Romans 5
On **peccatum originale**, Julian stands as the clearest denier of hereditary **culpa** among Latin Fathers. He reads **Romans 5.12** as teaching that death spread to all because all actually sin, not that all sinned **in Adam**. The Greek *eph ho* is for him causal, so the text affirms personal responsibility rather than **imputation**. Adam’s transgression functions as **bad example** and tragically inaugurates a history of sin, but it does not communicate guilt or destroy the **imago Dei**. Infants are born mortal and in need of **salvation** as a journey to God, yet they are not culpable. Hence **infant baptism** is a sacrament of incorporation and sanctification, not principally a washing of inherited guilt.

The corollary is a robust conviction that **sinlessness** is genuinely possible by human beings with the help of **gratia** understood as law, instruction, and pardon. Julian never denies the ubiquity of sin in practice, but he resists any doctrine of **necessitas peccandi** and any claim that the will is incapacitated by a transmitted fault. He contends that Augustine’s **massa damnata** collapses responsibility into a tragic determinism, turning divine justice arbitrary. By contrast, a just God commands only what can be performed, and provides **aid** sufficient for the will to choose the good.

#### 6. Grace, freedom, and the aids of salvation
Julian’s **gratia** is real, rich, and necessary, yet it is of a sort profoundly different from **Augustinian prevenient grace**. He enumerates the **law**, **teaching**, **forgiveness of sins**, **the example of Christ**, **the sacraments**, and the **gift of the Spirit** as divine aids ordered to heal ignorance and strengthen choice. Grace does not determine or infallibly move the will; it summons, enlightens, and assists. The will remains the proximate cause of good action, while God is the transcendent giver of the order in which such action is possible. In this scheme **liberum arbitrium** is not a neutral faculty but an active power that, through habituation and instruction, can grow into **virtue**.

In contesting **effectual calling**, Julian pushes a juridical and pedagogical account of redemption. He rejects any notion that God elects some to life apart from foreseen merit, since that would dissolve **equity** and make divine commands a mockery. He thus aligns with currents of **synergy** found in the Antiochene tradition, though his polemical focus is the West’s **Augustinianism**. Grace is not monergistic agency but the generous horizon within which truly free obedience is possible.

#### 7. Christ, exemplar, and the economy of salvation
Julian’s **Christology** does not occupy the center of his polemic, yet it is quietly at work. His sympathy with **Theodore of Mopsuestia** and the Antiochene accent on the genuine humanity of Christ reinforces his commitment to **moral exemplarity**. Christ’s obedience discloses the path of **virtue** attainable by grace-aided human wills. The cross and resurrection bring **remission of sins** and the gift of the **Spirit**, yet do not function as the satisfaction for an imputed Adamic guilt. Salvation is the reconstitution of human life in covenantal fellowship through **instruction**, **imitation**, and **forgiveness**, not primarily the deliverance from a hereditary depravity that renders the will impotent.

This coheres with Julian’s insistence that the **imago Dei** is not shattered. In Christ the image is perfectly displayed, and believers are enabled to conform through **teaching** and **sacramental grace**. The economy thus turns on a restorative pedagogy rather than a re-creative transformation of the will’s very capacity, which for Julian would imply that God first withholds what he later gives, thereby complicating divine goodness and **justice**.

#### 8. Rhetoric and the charge of Manichaeism
Julian’s most ferocious charge against **Augustine** is the allegation of **Manichaean residue**, especially in the identification of **concupiscence** as sin and the depiction of humanity as a **massa perditionis**. He crafts a consistent rhetorical strategy: Augustine’s doctrine, he says, blasphemes the **Creator** by denigrating bodily generation, undermines **marriage** by declaring libido sinful, and imputes to God injustice by condemning infants who have committed no fault. He presses scriptural loci that celebrate the **goodness of creation**, and he highlights prophetic calls to choose life, as warrant for a synergistic moral theology.

Augustine’s rejoinders in **Contra Iulianum** and the **Opus imperfectum** insist that Julian misconstrues both **creation** and **grace**. Concupiscence is not a substance or a creaturely faculty but a disordered habitus, a wound and penalty, and its persistence in the regenerate does not entail dualism. Moreover **Romans 5** establishes **solidarity with Adam** in guilt and death, which in turn frames the second Adam’s **obedience** and the **gift of righteousness** as vicarious and effectual. The polemic sharpened each point into opposition, leaving little space for mediation.

#### 9. Reception, eclipse, and afterlives
Julian’s cause was formally condemned across the Latin West, and the **Council of Ephesus 431** amplified earlier censures of **Celestius** and the broader Pelagian thesis. His later life in exile, likely dying c. 454 in Sicily, sealed his marginality. Yet his influence persisted indirectly. The **Semi-Pelagian** currents in southern Gaul redeemed parts of his moral optimism while rejecting outright denial of inherited sin, and later debates over **Romans 5** in **Erasmus** and in early modern polemics revived the **eph ho** reading Julian had championed. In the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, scholars probing the complexities of **Augustinianism** often treated Julian as a sharp-minded critic whose questions about **dualism**, **marriage**, and the **goodness of nature** demanded careful hearing.

The textual legacy of Julian’s thought thus comes through adversaries. The extensive excerpts in **Mercator**, and the line-by-line citations in **Augustine’s** anti-Julian works, preserve a rare mirror-portrait of a theologian whose project was to secure **nature’s integrity**, **responsible freedom**, and a pedagogy of **grace**. Even in defeat, the clarity of his antitheses forced Latin theology to refine its accounts of **concupiscence**, **baptism**, and **imputation**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage, anchored in **covenant theology**, **federal headship**, and **effectual grace**, Julian’s program falters at key points while posing salutary questions. Positively, his defense of the **goodness of creation** and the **bonum nuptiarum** guards against any **Manichaean** drift and rightly protests simplistic vilifications of **concupiscence** as a creaturely faculty rather than as a disordered condition. Yet his denial of **hereditary guilt** and of **original corruption** contradicts **Romans 5** read within a federal frame, where Adam’s one trespass leads to condemnation and the second Adam’s obedience to justification by **imputation**. By reducing **gratia** to law, teaching, example, and pardon, Julian collapses the nature-grace distinction into a moral pedagogy and loses **monergistic regeneration** and **effectual calling**. His insistence on the intact **imago Dei** and on the possibility of sinlessness underestimates the noetic and volitional ruin of the fall, a point underscored by **total depravity** as inability rather than maximal badness. A Reformed alternative retains Julian’s anti-dualist instinct while grounding **marriage**, **sanctification**, and the renewal of the will in the **Spirit’s** sovereign work, and it reads **eph ho** within the broader Pauline argument for **representation** in Adam and Christ, thereby securing both creation’s goodness and grace’s radical efficacy.
