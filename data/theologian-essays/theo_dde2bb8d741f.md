### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Catherine L. McDowell emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** Old Testament theologian whose work is situated at the crossroads of **comparative Ancient Near Eastern studies** and **canonical-theological exegesis**. Educated in the wake of the late twentieth-century turn toward **temple cosmology**, **idol polemic**, and **biblical theology**, she has pursued a research program that reads **Genesis 1–3** with close attention to **Hebrew philology** and to the ritual culture of **Mesopotamia**, especially the **mīs pî and pīt pî** image-initiation rites. The intellectual context includes the stimulating claims of **John Walton** on functional ontology, **J. Richard Middleton** on the **imago Dei** as royal vocation, and **G. K. Beale** on **Eden as sanctuary**, along with the careful historical work of **Michael Dick** on the manufacture and consecration of cult images. These streams converge in McDowell’s insistence that **Scripture** speaks in the idiom of its world but also subverts it, a hermeneutic of analogy-with-polemic that favors **canonical coherence** and doctrinal traction for **creation** and **anthropology**.

McDowell’s method is explicitly **philological and comparative**, but her epistemic posture is that of a **confessional evangelical**: **Scripture’s authority** regulates the use of ANE materials, which supply historical texture rather than controlling paradigms. The key terms **ṣelem** image and **dĕmût** likeness in **Genesis 1:26–27**, as well as **ʿābad** to serve and **šāmar** to guard in **Genesis 2:15**, are read in dialogue with Akkadian and Sumerian ritual vocabularies surrounding the crafting, enlivening, and installation of cult statues. By anchoring exegesis in both **textual intertexture** and **ritual worlds**, McDowell seeks to avoid both **parallelomania** and **isolationism**, positioning the **imago Dei** as Israel’s profound reconfiguration of a common ancient conversation about images, presence, and sacred space.

#### 2. Major work and thesis
McDowell’s signature contribution is the monograph **The Image of God in the Garden of Eden** 2015, a published form of the Harvard dissertation 2013. The book’s thesis is crisp: the **creation of the human** in **Genesis 2:5–3:24** narrates a process structurally analogous to ANE **cult-image initiation**, but now turned inside out as polemic and gospel. Where Mesopotamian craftsmen fashion a **statue** and consecrate it through **mīs pî** washing of the mouth and **pīt pî** opening of the mouth to install divine presence, the **God of Israel** personally forms the human from dust, breathes life, places the human in a **sacred garden**, and commissions a **royal-priestly vocation**. The upshot is a reformulated **imago Dei**: not a mute idol demanding maintenance, but a living, sentient **vicegerent** who embodies and mediates the **presence and rule** of the Creator within a sanctuary cosmos. This thesis reframes debates that pitted **ontological resemblance** against **functional authority** by integrating both under the rubric of **image-installation** and **Edenic liturgy**.

Essential to this argument is McDowell’s layered reading of **Eden as sanctuary**. The rivers, precious stones, and eastward orientation recall temple symbology; the verbs **ʿābad** and **šāmar** echo priestly service and guarding language in **Numbers** and **Chronicles**; and the proximity of tree and presence indicates a zone of life, wisdom, and probation. The **imago Dei** thus connotes a vocation in a place of presence, a **sacred-space anthropology**. In this rendering, **idolatry** becomes a tragically inverted anthropology: humans craft what they are called to be, surrendering vocation to fabricated proxies that cannot breathe or speak. The **fall** is by that token a crisis of **image-bearers-as-priests**, corrupting dominion into domination and service into self-protection, and thereby introducing the need for a renewed **image** and a renovated **temple**.

#### 3. Comparative analyses and controls
McDowell’s comparative strategy drills into the **mīs pî and pīt pî** rituals through the lens of **Akkadian** procedural texts and the later **Assyrian and Babylonian** compilations. She identifies ritual steps such as purification, mouth-washing, breath-infusion, clothing, enthronement, and processional installation, then highlights formal correspondences with **Genesis 2**. Yet she insists on **three theological controls**. First, the **Creator-creature distinction** is radicalized, not blurred; Israel’s God forms without divine intermediaries or magical incantations, ruling out the **analogia entis** that would ground deity in nature. Second, image-making is relocated from cult to creation; **anthropology** absorbs what in the ANE belonged to artisanship, a deliberate **idol polemic**. Third, the outcome is ethical and covenantal, not merely metaphysical; the **image** is commissioned to **ʿābad** and **šāmar** the garden, echoing covenant guardianship and royal stewardship under God’s **blessing and mandate**.

In dialogue with **J. Richard Middleton**, McDowell welcomes the **royal-functional** reading but resists collapsing the **imago Dei** into sheer sovereignty. The **breath of life** and the garden’s liturgical architecture embed an **ontological and priestly** texture within function. Engaging **John Walton**, she appreciates the **temple-cosmos** emphasis while strengthening the **liturgical anthropology** that his model sometimes leaves implicit. And in conversation with **G. K. Beale**, she aligns on **Eden-temple typology** but argues for a closer tether to ANE ritual scripts to show how **Genesis** both appropriates and overturns the cultural grammar of images and sanctuaries.

#### 4. Eden, priesthood, and the human vocation
A distinctive payoff of McDowell’s thesis is a richly triangulated account of **human vocation** as **royal-priestly stewardship**. The intertext of **ʿābad** and **šāmar** with **Levitical service** frames the human as guardian of sacred space, mediating wise order and flourishing. The dominion of **Genesis 1:28** is thus neither extractive nor technocratic but **liturgical and representative**, a participation in God’s **kingly care** that mirrors **priestly attentiveness**. In this sense, the **image** is both liturgy and law because proximity to presence implies adherence to the **divine will**, turning anthropology into a moral shape. The prohibition regarding the **tree of the knowledge of good and evil** functions as a test of loyal representation rather than an arbitrary limit, reinforcing the **covenantal structure** embedded in creation.

This yields a potent grammar for **idolatry**: to bow to an idol is to abdicate vocation, to cede royal-priestly representation to artifacts and thereby mute human speech and agency. The prophetic taunts in **Isaiah** and **Jeremiah** against dumb idols meet the narrative tragedy of **Genesis 3**, where the **serpent’s lie** tempts image-bearers to self-definition apart from liturgical obedience. McDowell’s rendering stabilizes the anthropological discourse with **sanctuary** as the orienting metaphor, confronting the modern temptation to autodidactic identity with a vision of **priestly communion** and **obedient dominion**.

#### 5. Image, resurrection, and new creation
Though primarily an Old Testament specialist, McDowell’s framework opens to canonical horizons in **Christological and ecclesial** directions. The New Testament presentation of **Christ as the eikōn** image evokes a recapitulation of the **Edenic vocation**, in which the Last Adam fulfills the royal-priestly commission and inaugurates the **new temple**. McDowell’s approach, with its focus on **image-installation** and **sacred space**, readily interfaces with **Johannine temple Christology**, **Pauline new creation**, and **1 Peter’s royal priesthood**. The ecclesial community becomes a living **temple** in **union with the true Image**, empowered to **ʿābad** and **šāmar** the world through worship, proclamation, and justice. This canonical extension is not a speculative add-on but a structural entailment of defining **imago Dei** as a vocation in sacred space.

By emphasizing **breath**, **word**, and **presence** in the initial installation of the image, McDowell also primes a theological link to **Pentecost** and the enlivening work of the **Spirit** who conforms the church to **Christ’s image**. In this vista, **sanctification** appears as the restoration of **knowledge, righteousness, and holiness** classic **Reformed** descriptors of the image in a way that deepens her functional focus with moral and ontological renewal, closing the circle between **creation**, **redemption**, and **eschatology**.

#### 6. Philology and theological precision
A consistent feature of McDowell’s work is **philological care**. The semantics of **ṣelem** and **dĕmût** are not mined for philosophical substance but for **intertextual patterns** that guide theological judgments. Likewise, the pairing **ʿābad** and **šāmar** is not invoked as a word-study talisman but set within **priestly texts** where service aligns with **guardianship of holy things**. Her discussion of **breath** draws together **ruaḥ** and narrative dynamics rather than importing Greek substance metaphysics into Hebrew idiom. In sum, the semantics are made to serve **biblical theology**, preserving the strangeness of Israel’s idiom while still tracking toward **doctrinal articulation** that can converse with **systematic theology**.

This philological precision underwrites McDowell’s polemical clarity about **idolatry**. The ANE ritual texts, especially the **mīs pî and pīt pî** materials cataloged by **Michael Dick** and others, display a sophisticated theology of presence in images. McDowell’s point is not to caricature this theology but to show how **Genesis** directly addresses its claims. When the **Lord God** breathes into the human and installs the human in a **garden-temple**, the parallel to **mouth-opening** is unmistakable, and yet the difference is decisive: the image is not a crafted object but a covenant partner. Thus a theology of **human dignity** arises precisely in the overthrow of the idol’s claim, anchoring ethics in **vocation** rather than in **autonomy** or **utility**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
McDowell’s work inhabits an active field of debate among evangelicals and broader biblical scholarship regarding the **imago Dei**. Against readings that isolate the **image** to rationality alone, she foregrounds **royal and priestly function**, integrating **Middleton’s** kingdom emphasis with stronger **sanctuary** categories. In contrast to overly **functional-only** readings, however, she retrieves moral ontology by showing that **priestly service** presupposes conformity to God’s **holiness**, which dovetails with **Calvin’s** classic triad **knowledge, righteousness, holiness**. Her engagement with **Walton’s** cosmic temple suggests that the world is designed for **divine rest** and human **vicegerency**, yet she presses for **Eden** as archetypal sanctuary whose **liturgical structure** regulates how function is construed.

Interchange with **G. K. Beale** is especially congenial, as both share a commitment to **Eden-temple typology** and to the **church as temple**. McDowell’s distinctive contribution is to bind that typology to concrete ANE **ritual scripts**, clarifying the polemical import of **Genesis 2–3** and giving texture to the **fall** as failed guardianship. The result is a theology of **creation and idolatry** that neither romanticizes the ANE nor evacuates it of theological significance, a precise example of evangelical **ressourcement** within critical scholarship.

#### 8. Ethical and ecclesial implications
The anthropology that flows from McDowell’s reading carries discernible ethical weight. To be **God’s image** is to embody a **public vocation** ordered to the flourishing of creation through **priestly stewardship** and **kingly justice**. This challenges modern reductions of identity to expressive individualism by reinstating **liturgical obedience** and **service** as constitutive goods. It also underwrites a strong doctrine of **human dignity** across all conditions, since image-bearing is divinely granted and teleologically ordered to **communion and care**, not to performance or power. The critique of **idolatry** becomes an audit of economic and political practices that turn humans into instruments, recovering prophetic concerns within a **creation-covenant** horizon.

Ecclesially, McDowell’s account reorients **worship** and **mission**. If the church is a **temple-people**, then its basic acts word, sacrament, prayer are formative for **image-renewal**, and its **mission** extends the garden’s **ʿābad/šāmar** pattern into neighborhoods and nations. The **Great Commission** can be read as a Christic recapitulation of the **cultural mandate**, fulfilled by the **true Image** and shared with the body united to him. Here McDowell’s work participates in a wider evangelical retrieval of **biblical theology** that bridges exegesis and ecclesial practice, easing fruitfully into **systematic loci** such as **anthropology**, **hamartiology**, **Christology**, and **ecclesiology**.

#### 9. Summary of contribution
At once historically sensitive and theologically ambitious, McDowell’s scholarship reframes the **imago Dei** through the lens of **Eden as sanctuary** and **image-installation polemic**, refusing both speculative abstraction and reductive sociological readings. Her monograph **The Image of God in the Garden of Eden** 2015 anchors the case with **philological rigor** and deft handling of **ANE ritual texts**, while her essays extend the paradigm to **idolatry**, **priesthood**, and the storyline of **creation to new creation**. The driving insight is that **Genesis** speaks in a world where images mediate presence, and it announces that the living image is the human called to **royal-priestly service**. This insight opens to canonical vistas in **Christ as Image**, **church as temple**, and **Spirit-empowered renewal**, providing a thick evangelical account of **human vocation** and **divine presence**.

Final Reformed and WTS evaluation. McDowell’s **Scripture-first**, **comparative-with-controls** method coheres with **Reformed** instincts about **general and special revelation** and the hermeneutic of **covenant**. Her emphasis on **royal-priestly vocation** harmonizes with classic **federal theology** that reads **Adam** as king-priest in a **covenant of life** and **Christ** as the **true Image** who restores the **munus triplex**. Cautions remain. First, the magnetic pull of **functional accounts** of the **imago Dei** can understate the **ontological and moral** dimensions emphasized by **Reformed orthodoxy** knowledge, righteousness, holiness as essential facets of the image’s created integrity and eschatological restoration. Second, the heavy heuristic use of **ANE rituals** risks a weighting of background that could overshadow **text-internal** and **canonical** developments, especially the Pauline concentration on **union with Christ** and **sanctification**. The Reformed alternative is not a rejection but a recalibration: receive McDowell’s **temple-garden** and **image-installation polemic** as illuminating the **covenant of creation**, then integrate it with the classical loci so that the **imago Dei** is both vocation and nature, both office and endowment, marred by **sin**, renewed by **grace**, and consummated in **glory**.
