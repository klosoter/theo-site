### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
A. T. B. McGowan emerges from the Scottish **Reformed evangelical** world of the late twentieth century, ministering and leading in institutions like **Rutherford House** in Edinburgh and the **Highland Theological College** in the University of the Highlands and Islands. His academic and ecclesial labors take shape amid an Anglo-American tension over the language of **biblical authority**, with British evangelicals long speaking of **infallibility** and American conservatives rallying around **inerrancy** in the wake of the **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy** and the 1978 **Chicago Statement**. McGowan situates himself as a confessional Reformed theologian under the **Westminster Standards**, with an eye to the catholic breadth of **Calvin** and the **Reformed orthodox**, and with an insistence that dogmatics serve the church’s proclamation of the **Word of God** through the **Spirit**. His enduring thesis turns bibliology from defensive modern apologetic to a **pneumatological** and ecclesial account of **Sola Scriptura** grounded in **autopistia** and the *testimonium internum Spiritus Sancti*.

Historically, McGowan reads the twentieth-century evangelical doctrine of Scripture through two lenses: on the one hand, **Old Princeton** in **Hodge** and **Warfield**, whose epistemic posture he judges indebted to **Scottish Common Sense Realism** and modern foundationalism; on the other, the legacy of **Barth** and postcritical biblical theology, which recovered **Christocentric** focus and **Trinitarian** dynamism but sometimes attenuated the Bible’s status as the Word written. Within this contested field, McGowan’s method is a **ressourcement** of **Reformed orthodoxy** that is neither repristinating nor revisionist for its own sake. He retrieves classic loci, terms, and distinctions like **organic inspiration**, **accommodatio**, **perspicuitas**, **sufficientia**, and **canon** as providentially received, and he seeks to reframe evangelical prolegomena under the doctrinal weight of **Word-and-Spirit** rather than under the pressure of modern empiricism.

Methodologically, McGowan proposes that a faithful Reformed epistemology must be irreducibly **ecclesial**, **Trinitarian**, and **pneumatological**. He insists that Scripture’s authority is **self-authenticating** by virtue of its **divine spiration** and divine author, not by extrinsic verification. The Spirit grants knowledge of Scripture’s authority through the *testimonium*, producing assurance that is warranted by God’s truth rather than by neutral rational criteria. This theological stance opens space for robust **theological interpretation of Scripture**, a canonical posture akin to the concerns of **Bavinck** and more recent hermeneutical work associated with **Vanhoozer**, without surrendering the Reformation commitments to **Sola Scriptura** and **analogia fidei**. The result is a prolegomena in which **Christology**, **Trinity**, and **pneumatology** order the doctrine of Scripture, while the church’s confession orders the theologian’s method.

#### 2. Major works and the retrieval of bibliology
McGowan’s editorial leadership in **Always Reforming: Explorations in Systematic Theology** 2006 frames the whole of dogmatics under the Reformed motto *ecclesia semper reformanda*. The volume gathers voices to pursue doctrinal development faithful to **Scripture** and the **Reformed confessions** while addressing contemporary issues across the loci of **Trinity**, **Christology**, **atonement**, **ecclesiology**, and **prolegomena**. McGowan’s own contributions underscore that theology is a churchly discipline accountable to **exegesis** and **confession**, always learning to say again what **Calvin** and the **Reformed scholastics** taught, yet free to clarify and distinguish anew amid modern and postmodern challenges. The programmatic vision is that systematics should neither fossilize the tradition nor reinvent Christianity, but rather articulate **dogma** under the authority of the **canon** and the guidance of the **Spirit**.

The heart of McGowan’s distinctive contribution lies in **The Divine Spiration of Scripture: Challenging Evangelical Perspectives** 2007. The central lexical move is to replace the common English term **inspiration** with **spiration**, because, he argues, the Greek *theopneustos* of 2 Timothy 3:16 speaks of God’s breathing out the Scriptures, not breathing into them. This linguistic adjustment signals a substantive thesis: Scripture is what it is because of God’s **causal agency** in its origin, the **Spirit** acting through **organic inspiration** to bring forth genuinely human discourse that is, in and through its humanity, God’s own **Word**. McGowan insists that the Reformed tradition’s account of **accommodatio** must be integral to this doctrine. God accommodates himself to creaturely modes of speech, culture, and history, producing a text marked by human particularities and limitations but sovereignly fitted to communicate **saving truth** with **infallible** efficacy.

McGowan’s signature polemical claim follows: he contends that the modern evangelical category of **inerrancy** is neither necessary nor the best dogmatic term by which to confess Scripture’s truth and authority. He judges **inerrancy** to have functioned as a protective fence against higher critical excesses, yet to carry unintended modernist entailments that distort the Reformed center of gravity in **autopistia** and the *testimonium*. The term **infallibility**, classically employed by British evangelicals and compatible with **Westminster**’s doctrine of Scripture, better names Scripture’s unfailing reliability in all that God intends it to do and teach for faith and life. McGowan allows that there may be minor discrepancies or ordinary features of ancient historiography and cosmology that do not fit a modern standard of errorlessness; yet he insists that such human features do not vitiate Scripture’s **infallible** success in conveying **divine truth** and in ruling the church.

In developing this claim, McGowan engages **B. B. Warfield** and **Charles Hodge** with respectful rigor. He grants their service in clarifying **verbal plenary inspiration** and in defending the truthfulness of Scripture against **liberal** attacks. Nonetheless, he argues that **Old Princeton** often deploys the tools of **evidentialist** and **foundationalist** epistemology, leaning on **Common Sense Realism** in ways out of step with **Calvin** and **Turretin**, for whom **autopistia** and the *testimonium* norm the reception of Scripture. By contrast, McGowan favors the older Reformed emphasis that Scripture is self-authenticating because it is the **Spirit-breathed** Word, with **church** and **Spirit** together cultivating recognition, canon reception, and faithful reading. He thus proposes that the dogmatic grammar move from the modern question How can we prove Scripture? to the Reformed question How does God make himself known through Scripture?

McGowan’s dialogue with **Karl Barth** is equally significant. He appreciates Barth’s **Christological** centering of the **Word of God** and the triadic account of **revelation** in Church Dogmatics I/2, but he resists Barth’s separation of the **Word written** from the Word revealed. For McGowan, the divine action of **spiration** does not merely accompany human words; it constitutes them as God’s words, such that the text in its canonical form is the norming norm. In this light he criticizes any rhetoric that would reduce Scripture to a fallible witness that becomes the Word only in an event of encounter. He presses instead a **Trinitarian** account where the **Father** sends the **Son** and **Spirit** such that the apostolic and prophetic **Scriptures** are the Spirit’s chosen instrument to bring Christ’s voice to the church. Thus, while he rejects modern **inerrancy** as a controlling shibboleth, he resists any retreat to a Barthian actualism that evacuates the text’s settled **authority**.

#### 3. Doctrinal development and ecclesial implications
The doctrinal architecture of McGowan’s bibliology gathers a series of classic **Reformed** commitments. First, **canon** is received, not constituted, by the church; the **Spirit** superintends recognition and reception through providence and the *testimonium*. Second, **organic inspiration** safeguards both the integrity of the human authors and the primacy of **divine authorship**. Third, **accommodatio** explains the creaturely features of Scripture without undermining its **truth**. Fourth, **infallibility** affirms that Scripture cannot fail in all God intends to communicate and accomplish, especially in the economy of **salvation**. This suite of claims aims to relocate assurance in God’s own **veracity** and in the **self-attesting** power of the Word, rather than in external historicist proofs or in a flattening account of truth that takes modern scientific precision as the measure.

At the level of hermeneutics, McGowan’s project leans toward **theological interpretation of Scripture** and attends to **genre**, **speech-acts**, and canonical shape, themes that resonate with the work of figures like **Kevin J. Vanhoozer** and older Reformed interpreters who deployed **analogia fidei** and **regula fidei**. By attending to what a text does as well as what it says, and to what Scripture intends to effect in the economy of the **covenant**, he strengthens the claim that **infallibility** is not a retreat from truth but a richer account of truth as covenantal faithfulness. The practical fruits appear in preaching and catechesis: the minister can proclaim with confidence, This is the **Word of the Lord**, because the **Spirit** who breathed out Scripture now bears witness through it, effecting faith and obedience in the **church**.

McGowan’s constructive posture also includes an ecumenically minded **Reformed catholicity**. In **Always Reforming** he models how to read **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and the **Reformed scholastics** alongside contemporary philosophical and exegetical insights without surrendering confessional specificity. His aim is not to narrow the circle to a culture-war posture, but to strengthen evangelical doctrine for mission by deepening its **Trinitarian** and **Christological** roots. The watchword is that reform is not innovation for its own sake but a return to sources under the rule of the **canon**, guided by the **Spirit**, for the good of the **church**.

#### 4. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
The place where McGowan’s work most sharply enters debate is the evangelical discussion of **inerrancy** sparked by the **Chicago Statement** 1978 and by subsequent defenses in **Carl F. H. Henry**, **J. I. Packer**, and others. McGowan acknowledges the historical necessity of such defenses against **liberal** denials of Scripture’s truth, yet he judges the language to be pastorally unhelpful and theologically maladroit. He proposes that **infallibility** and a well-articulated doctrine of **accommodation** do the intended theological work while better honoring **Reformed** sources. This elicited critical dialogue from conservative Reformed theologians who fear that loosening inerrancy leaves the doctrine vulnerable to erosion, citing the witness of **E. J. Young** and **Ned Stonehouse** for a robust doctrine at **Westminster** while maintaining **autopistia**.

McGowan’s interaction with biblical criticism is nuanced. He does not baptize **historical-critical** assumptions, yet he accepts that the Bible employs ancient literary conventions and that controversies about harmonization should be adjudicated with sensitivity to **genre** and authorial intention. He invokes **accommodatio** as a better dogmatic category than modern harmonistic strategies. His insistence that Scripture is **infallible** for what God intends allows him to face textual phenomena without fear, trusting the **Spirit’s** purpose in shaping the canonical witness. Here his interlocutors include not only **Warfield** and **Packer**, but also critics like **James Barr**, whose sharp attacks on evangelical biblicism require a theologically thick response, and constructive hermeneuticians like **Vanhoozer**, whose **speech-act** approach supports a non-reductive account of **truth** and **reference** in Scripture.

Institutionally, McGowan has served the **Reformed** churches by building scholarship and ministerial formation in Scotland, especially through **Rutherford House** and the **Highland Theological College**. His public voice has been that of a pastor-theologian calling evangelicals to confidence in **Sola Scriptura** without anxiety, urging them to rest in the **self-attesting** Word and the **Spirit’s** witness. This is a positive retrieval of a **Westminster**-shaped vision of the Christian intellectual life in which theology arises from and returns to **exegesis**, **confession**, and **preaching**.

Theologically, his constructive agenda is a re-centering of bibliology within **Trinitarian** dogmatics. He refuses to treat Scripture as a freestanding axiom to be proven by neutral reason; rather, Scripture belongs within the economy of **revelation** whereby the **Father** makes the **Son** known through the **Spirit** by apostolic and prophetic communication, inscripturated by **divine spiration**. This integrated vision yields both confidence and humility: confidence because the source is God’s **truthfulness**, humility because our knowing is creaturely, dependent on the **Spirit**, and bound to the **church**.

The reception of McGowan among **Reformed** evangelicals has thus been mixed but fruitful. Many have welcomed his retrieval of **autopistia**, **accommodatio**, and **pneumatological** emphasis, seeing in it a deepening of the Reformation rather than a dilution. Others, particularly in quarters shaped by **Old Princeton** and **ICBI**, have pressed him on whether **infallibility** without **inerrancy** can bear the weight of doctrinal and pastoral needs in contested cultural arenas. In reply, McGowan maintains that the best pastoral defense of Scripture is not to mimic modern scientific standards, but to preach the **Spirit-breathed** Word that unfailingly accomplishes God’s **covenantal** purposes.

In sum, McGowan offers a contemporary Reformed model of prolegomena in which the **Spirit** is not an addendum but the architect, **divine spiration** names the source of Scripture’s authority, **infallibility** names its unfailing reliability, and **accommodatio** names its creaturely clothing. His work invites evangelicals to retrieve the breadth of **Calvin** and **Bavinck**, to clarify their terms, and to let the **canon** rule without the anxious need to adopt every modern polemical shibboleth.

The Reformed and Westminster evaluation belongs finally to a single integrated judgment. McGowan’s strengths are substantial: a thoroughly **Trinitarian** anchoring of revelation, a robust **Word-and-Spirit** epistemology grounded in **autopistia** and the *testimonium*, a confessional reading of **Sola Scriptura**, and a careful use of **accommodatio** and **organic inspiration** that resists both rationalistic **foundationalism** and Barthian **actualism**. The principal tension concerns his rejection of **inerrancy** as a confessional term. The **Westminster** tradition as articulated by figures like **Machen**, **Stonehouse**, and **E. J. Young** has insisted that Scripture is true in all that it affirms, once genre, intention, and **accommodation** are respected; this is not a capitulation to modernity but an entailment of divine **veracity** within the **covenant** of revelation. A WTS-shaped alternative would retain McGowan’s pneumatological emphasis and **autopistia**, while affirming **inerrancy** as a derivative implication of **infallibility** rightly defined: because the **Spirit** has breathed out these writings for God’s ends, they will not mislead the church in any claim they make, rightly interpreted. On this construal, the Chicago language need not dominate prolegomena, but nor need it be abandoned. McGowan’s reminder to move from defensive proof to doxological confidence in the **self-attesting** Scriptures is salutary; his hesitation about **inerrancy** should, in Westminster judgment, be resolved by articulating a covenantal, analogical, and genre-sensitive **inerrancy** under the rule of **Word and Spirit**.
