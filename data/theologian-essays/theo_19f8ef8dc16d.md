### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John W. Cooper emerged as a **Reformed philosopher-theologian** within the **neo-Calvinist** institutions centered in Grand Rapids during the late twentieth century, when **analytic philosophy of religion** was reshaping Protestant theology. His teaching career at **Calvin Theological Seminary** unfolded amid intense discussions about **mind-body identity**, renewed interest in **classical theism**, and the cultural ferment surrounding **gender and language for God**. The intellectual backdrop features **Plantingan Reformed epistemology**, the **Van Tillian** insistence on the **Creator-creature distinction**, and an ongoing retrieval of **Augustine** and **Calvin** in dialogue with contemporary metaphysics. Cooper’s method combines **confessional Reformed theology** and **canonical exegesis** with **analytic argumentation**, deploying precise modal and metaphysical distinctions while maintaining the primacy of **Scripture** and the **creedal tradition**. His project is marked by a Kuyperian commitment to the integrity of **creation**, the pervasiveness of **sin**, and the comprehensive claims of **redemption**, unified by the eschatological pattern of the **already and the not yet**.

Cooper’s guiding conviction is that **Christian doctrine** must be both biblically regulated and philosophically articulate, and that the authority of **revelation** governs, rather than is governed by, metaphysical schemes. Hence his characteristic blend of **exegetical argument** and **analytic metaphysics** functions not as speculative system-building but as **theological clarification**. Throughout his work he leverages the catholic grammar of **creation ex nihilo**, **divine aseity**, and **providence**, while employing the neo-Calvinist stress on **worldview analysis** to display the fissures of **naturalistic reductionism** and the theological costs of **panentheism**. The pragmatic venue of his thought is the church and academy of the contemporary West, where **physicalism** tempts Christian anthropology and **relational metaphysics** tempts Christian theology of God.

#### 2. Toward a holistic dualism of biblical anthropology
Cooper’s signature contribution is his defense of **holistic dualism** in **Body, Soul, and Life Everlasting** 1989, revised 2000. He argues for a robust yet non-Cartesian **substance dualism** that insists on the psychosomatic unity of the human person while affirming the soul’s capacity for **disembodied survival** by divine preservation. The term holistic signals his rejection of **Platonic body-negation**, **Gnostic escape**, and any soteriology that sidelines **bodily resurrection**. The term dualism signals his resistance to **Christian physicalism**, whether reductive or nonreductive, and his insistence that Scripture teaches an **intermediate state** with Christ that presupposes a real though qualified distinction between **soul** and **body**.

The argument unfolds on three fronts that display Cooper’s **method**. First, he offers **biblical exegesis** of **nefesh** and **ruach** in the Hebrew Scriptures and of **psyche**, **soma**, and **pneuma** in the New Testament, emphasizing holistic idiom while noting specific texts that entail **survival at death**. Second, he provides a **historical-theological retrieval** of **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Calvin**, contending that the catholic consensus on the **intermediate state** is underwritten by a metaphysical duality that is not optional for orthodoxy. Third, he engages **analytic philosophy of mind**, addressing **identity conditions**, **emergence**, and **causal closure**, and concluding that **nonreductive physicalism** fails to secure personal identity through death and fails to cohere with biblical assurances such as **Philippians 1** and **2 Corinthians 5**.

#### 3. Exegesis, resurrection, and the intermediate state
Cooper’s exegesis marshals scattered yet convergent textual lines to argue that **Scripture** affirms both **bodily resurrection** as the telos and a conscious **intermediate state** as the penultimate condition of the saved and the lost. He highlights **Luke 23 today you will be with me in Paradise**, **Philippians 1 to depart and be with Christ**, **Revelation 6 the souls under the altar**, and **Hebrews 12 the spirits of the righteous made perfect**, interpreting them within the eschatological horizon of the **already and the not yet**. These passages, in his reading, outstrip any purely **functional holism** and require an ontological principle of **personal continuity** through death. He pushes back against the standard physicalist reading of **1 Corinthians 15**, noting that Paul’s contrast of **psychikos** and **pneumatikos** concerns Spirit-determined embodiment, not a denial of a **soul** capable of **intermediate survival**.

A crucial nuance in Cooper’s holistic dualism is his insistence that the **soul’s survival** is not a natural immortality in the **Platonic** sense but a grace-dependent preservation by **God’s providence**. The **intermediate state** is thus an abnormal condition within the order of **creation** and **redemption**, grounded not in a metaphysical necessity but in the sovereign **Lordship of Christ**. He underscores the future centrality of **resurrection** to avoid any quietism about **embodiment**, while maintaining that without **dualism** the canonical witness loses its coherence concerning **personal identity**, **divine judgment**, and **communion with Christ** prior to the **parousia**.

#### 4. Engaging the physicalists and the philosophers of mind
In extended dialogue with **Nancey Murphy**, **Kevin Corcoran**, **Peter van Inwagen**, and **Lynne Rudder Baker**, Cooper argues that **Christian physicalism** cannot secure the goods it seeks. He treats **nonreductive physicalism** as a metaphysically thin position that smuggles in emergent properties without ontological grounding, while reductive materialism is rejected outright as inconsistent with **imago Dei** and the rational and moral agency presupposed by **covenant**. Against **van Inwagen’s** resurrection via divine reassembly and **Baker’s** constitution view, he contends that identity across death without a **soul-subject** lacks biblical warrant and threatens the pastoral assurance of **communion with Christ** at death. He insists that a **dual-subject** ontology is neither a relic of **Cartesianism** nor an accommodation to **Greek metaphysics**, but a biblically disciplined inference in step with **Augustinian** and **Reformed** trajectories.

Cooper attends carefully to issues such as **causal interaction**, **mental causation**, and **the closure of the physical**, arguing that **substance dualism** can be articulated without violating the integrity of created **orders**. He invokes a **Kuyperian** doctrine of sphere sovereignty to affirm stable creational patterns while allowing for **divine concursus** and a non-competitive account of **causality**. The result is a model where **soul and body** form a tight unity in ordinary life, with the **soul** as the seat of first-person awareness and rational agency, yet capable by **God’s upholding** of existing *seorsum* during the **intermediate state**. The burden for physicalists to reconcile their view with the **intermediate state** remains in his assessment unmet.

#### 5. Panentheism and the integrity of classical theism
Cooper’s second major front is the long arc critique in **Panentheism: The Other God of the Philosophers** 2006. He traces a genealogy from **Plato** and **Stoicism** through **Hegel** and **Schelling** to **Whitehead**, **Hartshorne**, **Moltmann**, and **Pannenberg**, showing how the motif of the world in God has functioned as a metaphysical alternative to **classical theism**. The promise of panentheism is a relational God, a metaphysic of becoming, and an ontology of participation that resolves the problem of evil and divine passibility. Cooper argues that the cost is too high, since panentheism dilutes **creation ex nihilo**, undermines **divine aseity**, compromises **immutability** and **impassibility**, and blurs the **Creator-creature distinction** central to **Reformed orthodoxy**.

His constructive alternative is the deepening of **classical theism** in a biblical key. He appeals to **divine simplicity** and **immutability** to secure God’s life *ad intra*, while affirming the full range of **biblical anthropopathisms** read analogically for God’s works *ad extra*. Against **process theism** and **open theism**, Cooper defends the comprehensive **providence** of the triune God, with **compatibilist freedom** and covenantal history upheld by **meticulous sovereignty**. He distinguishes **panentheism** from **sacramental participation** and from **union with Christ**, insisting that biblical communion does not imply **ontological inclusion** of the world within God. The upshot is a renovated classical theism grounded in **Scripture**, sharpened by **analytic metaphysics**, and alert to the lures of modern **relational ontologies**.

#### 6. The naming of God and the order of revelation
In **Our Father in Heaven** 1998, Cooper addresses the contested terrain of **inclusive language for God**. He engages **Elizabeth Johnson** and other feminist theologians who argue for **gender-inclusive or gender-balanced** divine naming. Cooper affirms the equal dignity of male and female as **imago Dei**, the rich panoply of **maternal metaphors** for God in Scripture, and the necessity of careful pastoral speech. Yet he contends that the revealed **divine names** carry covenantal authority, especially the address of the first person as **Father** and the christological pattern of **Father and Son in the Spirit**. The grammar of **Trinitarian identity** is embedded in **biblical revelation**, so the church’s primary naming must be normed by **Scripture** and **creed** rather than by external **ideological criteria**.

Cooper’s argument unfolds along lines consistent with his wider project. He argues that **naming God** is a matter of **revelation and covenant**, not merely of metaphorical extension or pragmatic accommodation. He therefore distinguishes between analogical predication that is **biblically warranted** and nominal innovations that threaten the **economic-immanent** correlation of **Trinitarian doctrine**. The generous margin he allows for **metaphorical maternal imagery** is framed by the non-negotiable core of **Father-Son** language, which, he argues, is sacramentally embedded in **baptismal confession** and **liturgical tradition**. The result is a position that affirms the impulse to avoid **sexist usage** while resisting revisions that dislocate **Trinitarian grammar**.

#### 7. Integration and theological posture
Across these domains Cooper models a **Reformed integrative posture** that is simultaneously **exegetical**, **historical-catholic**, and **analytic**. His anthropology, doctrine of God, and theology of language share a single set of convictions: **Scripture’s primacy**, the **Creator-creature distinction**, and the Christological and eschatological shape of **redemption**. He inherits from **Augustine** and **Calvin** a focus on **God’s sovereignty** and the **ordo salutis**, and from **neo-Calvinism** the vision of theology as a **public task** engaging the social and intellectual currents of the age. By bringing **philosophy of mind** into disciplined contact with **biblical theology**, he encourages pastors and scholars to read **1 Corinthians 15** and **2 Corinthians 5** with metaphysical literacy. By mapping the **panentheist family** of options with care, he clarifies the stakes in contemporary **doctrine of God** debates and guards against soft capitulations to **process metaphysics**.

Even where one dissents from his **dualism** or from elements of his **classical theism**, Cooper’s contributions raise the level of discourse in the Reformed world. He has pressed Christian physicalists to own the exegetical and pastoral price of their view and has compelled panentheists to show how their proposals preserve **aseity**, **simplicity**, and **impassibility**. His work shows an ecclesially located **analytic theology** that serves **catechesis**, **preaching**, and **pastoral care**, especially concerning **death**, **hope**, and the confession of the **triune Name**. The unifying thread is a biblically governed metaphysic that orders anthropology, theology proper, and ecclesial speech under the lordship of **Christ**.

#### 8. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Cooper’s project exhibits strong alignment on **Scripture’s authority**, the **Creator-creature distinction**, and the **centrality of resurrection**. His critique of **panentheism** is a timely service to **classical theism**, reinforcing **creation ex nihilo**, **aseity**, and **providence** in a manner resonant with **Reformed scholastic** commitments. His defense of **biblical naming** coheres with a covenantal account of **revelation** that gives primacy to **Father-Son-Spirit** grammar. The principal point of tension concerns the metaphysical load borne by **substance dualism**. While many in the Reformed tradition have affirmed a **soul-body duality**, others would prefer a **Thomistic hylomorphism** or a more explicitly **covenantal anthropology** that secures the **intermediate state** through **divine preservation** without robust **soul-substance** claims. A Westminster-style **Van Tilian** approach might also press Cooper to subordinate **analytic categories** more explicitly to the **covenant-historical** frame of **creation, fall, redemption**, with **analogical knowledge of God** foregrounded to quarantine speculative inferences. None of these reservations blunt the force of Cooper’s core insights. A revised articulation could retain his **intermediate state** and **classical theism** while couching them in the idiom of **federal theology**, **union with Christ**, and **eschatological consummation**, thereby reaping the gains of his critique of **physicalism** and **panentheism** while tightening alignment with **classical Reformed orthodoxy**.
