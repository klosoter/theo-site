### ESSAY
Keith A. Mathison emerges as a contemporary voice of **Reformed catholicity**, arguing that a classical **sola Scriptura** must be recovered alongside a Calvinian doctrine of the **Lord’s Supper** and a biblically rich, covenantally framed **eschatology**. Writing from the milieu of **Ligonier Ministries** and teaching in confessional contexts shaped by **R. C. Sproul**, he addresses late twentieth-century shifts in American Christianity: the evangelical slide into **solo Scriptura** biblicism, the renewed confidence of **Roman Catholic** and **Eastern Orthodox** apologetics, and the dominance of **dispensationalism** in popular eschatology. His project in works like **The Shape of Sola Scriptura** 2001, **Given For You** 2002, and **From Age to Age** 2009 is a retrieval enterprise, deploying **Heiko Oberman’s** typology of **Tradition I** and **Tradition II** to clarify where the Reformation stood and where contemporary debates have gone astray.

Mathison’s intellectual formation is best construed against the backdrop of late-modern Protestant identity crises concerning **authority**, **sacrament**, and **history**. The pressure points were intense: Protestant converts to **Rome** and **Orthodoxy** insisted that **sola Scriptura** was a historical fiction, while evangelical minimalism issued in a lonely **solo Scriptura** that severed Scripture from the **regula fidei** and the church’s **ministerial** voice. Within this contest, Mathison appropriates **confessional Reformed** sensibilities: the **Westminster Confession of Faith** on Scripture’s sufficiency and perspicuity, the **Three Forms of Unity** for ecclesial norms, and a commitment to **classical theism** and **covenantal hermeneutics**. His method is teleologically ecclesial rather than merely individual, yet jealously guards the exclusive infallibility of the **theopneustos** canon.

The methodological center of Mathison’s work is his thick restatement of **Tradition I** as the Reformation’s doctrine of **sola Scriptura**. The canon is the **norma normans non normata**, the only infallible norm; the church’s creeds and councils hold **ministerial, subordinate authority** as **norma normata**, bounded by the prophetic and apostolic scriptures. Mathison contrasts this with **Tradition II**, a post-Tridentine Roman two-source theory in which Scripture and unwritten tradition jointly convey revelation under **magisterial** adjudication, and with **Tradition 0**, the atomized **solo Scriptura** that reduces authority to the individual reader. The antidote to both ecclesiastical absolutism and privatized biblicism is a humble adherence to the **regula fidei** as a public, ecclesially recognized summary of Scripture, tested by the **analogia fidei**, and receptive to the consensual wisdom of **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformed scholastic** voices.

This constructive case is prosecuted in **The Shape of Sola Scriptura** 2001, a sustained retrieval that leans on **Heiko Oberman** while exegeting **Vincent of Lérins’** dictum quod ubique, quod semper, quod ab omnibus as a heuristic rather than an infallible canon of truth. Mathison argues that the **Reformers** did not pioneer a novel principle of private judgment but re-situated interpretive authority within the church under Scripture. He reads **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** as witnessing to **ministerial** rather than **magisterial** tradition, and he adduces **Westminster 1.10** to insist that all councils may err and are to be corrected by the Word. He thus counters Roman Catholic claims that **sola Scriptura** dissolves into anarchy by displaying the Reformed commitment to creedal discipline, while exposing **solo Scriptura** as a modern individualism alien to the **Reformation** and to the ancient **catholic** pattern. The upshot is a principled distinction: the church hears and confesses; Scripture alone speaks with inerrant voice.

If the question of authority dominates one axis of Mathison’s work, the **eucharistic** question shapes another. In **Given For You: Reclaiming Calvin’s Doctrine of the Lord’s Supper** 2002, he labors to retrieve **Calvin’s spiritual real presence**, resisting both the memorialist trajectory of **Zwinglian** and broader **evangelical** practice and the ontological claims of **transubstantiation**. Mathison grants the **Lutheran** stress on objective divine action but prefers **Calvin’s** pneumatological account in which the Spirit unites believers to the ascended Christ so that, by faith and through the *sursum corda*, they truly feed on Christ’s body and blood. The sacrament exhibits **sacramental union** rather than a change of substance, and its efficacy is tethered to the Word, the *epiclesis* of the Spirit, and living faith. He emphasizes that *anamnesis* in the Supper is more than mental recall; it is covenantal re-presentation of Christ’s once-for-all oblation that seals the **promissio** to the faithful. Against free-church minimalism, Mathison insists on pastoral **fencing of the table**, reverent administration, and frequency consonant with **Reformed** liturgical norms, all under the authority of **Scripture** and confessed in dialogue with the **fathers** and the **magisterial Reformers**.

Mathison’s eschatological voice was first clearly heard in **Postmillennialism: An Eschatology of Hope** 1999 and then expanded in **From Age to Age: The Unfolding of Biblical Eschatology** 2009. He advocates a moderate **postmillennialism** grounded in the **already and not yet** of the kingdom, avoiding triumphalist theologies of glory while affirming long-term gospel leavening in history. Reading the **Olivet Discourse** and significant portions of **Revelation** through a **partial preterist** lens, he holds that the judgment on Jerusalem in AD 70 stands as the proximate fulfillment of many apocalyptic texts, while firmly confessing a future visible **parousia**, bodily **resurrection**, and final **judgment**. This allows him to reject both the timetable speculation of popular **dispensationalism** and the radical realized eschatology of **hyper-preterism**, a position he confronts directly as editor of **When Shall These Things Be?** 2004. The logic is covenantal and christological: Christ’s enthronement and the outpoured Spirit guarantee the church’s missional advance until the nations are discipled, a hope rooted in **Psalm 110**, **1 Corinthians 15**, and the prophetic vision of **new creation**.

The hermeneutical backbone of this eschatology is displayed in **From Age to Age** 2009, a canonical and redemptive-historical survey indebted to **Vos** and **Ridderbos**. Mathison traces the arc from **creation** through **fall**, **Abrahamic promise**, and **Mosaic administration** to **Davidic kingship**, **prophetic hope**, and the **new covenant**, highlighting the **covenant of grace** as the through-line that coheres Scripture’s unity. He privileges the **sensus literalis** as embedded in the canon’s final form, while allowing a disciplined **typology** and a Ministerial use of **sensus plenior** where the New Testament itself discloses deeper fulfillment. The **analogia fidei** functions as a control on speculative systems, and the **Christocentric** focus keeps exegesis tethered to the person and work of the Mediator. In contrast to **dispensationalism**, Mathison denies a hard Israel-church disjunction, reading **Ephesians 2** and **Romans 11** as articulating one **people of God** across the ages.

In polemical register, Mathison’s critiques are historically informed rather than merely reactive. Against **dispensationalism**, he contests the hermeneutical axiom that literal equals non-typological, preferring the **Reformed** axiom that the literal sense is the meaning intended by the divine and human authors within the canon’s covenantal horizons. Against **hyper-preterism** influenced by figures like **Max King**, he marshals creedal **catholic** boundaries on the **resurrection of the body** and the future **parousia**, showing that denial of these eschatological certainties severs the church from the **Apostles’ Creed**, **Nicene** confession, and **Westminster** standards. Against **Roman Catholic** and **Eastern Orthodox** claims that **sola Scriptura** is self-refuting, he revisits **patristic** testimony to Scripture’s sufficiency, especially the use of the **regula fidei** as a summary rather than a second source of revelation. At each turn, he attempts to wed historical precision with confessional clarity.

It is important to see that Mathison’s retrieval posture aims at churchly stability. By insisting on **ministerial authority** for creeds and confessions, he resists both unmoored **individualism** and the consolidation of **magisterial** infallibility outside the Bible. By a Calvinian **spiritual real presence**, he provides a sacramental grammar capable of sustaining reverent piety beyond bare memorialism while avoiding metaphysical commitments incompatible with **Reformed** confessions. By a hopeful **postmillennial** horizon tempered by **partial preterism**, he offers a missional rationale that energizes cultural obedience without collapsing the **cross** into a theology of **glory**. The strategy is one of ordered retrieval for ecclesial renewal.

Interlocutors and conversation partners vary across topics but reveal a coherent trajectory. On authority, Mathison leans on **Heiko Oberman** while engaging contemporary **Roman Catholic** apologists and confessional **Protestant** defenders like **James R. White**, with the ghost of **Warfield** hovering over debates about inspiration and canon. On sacrament, the central dialogue is with **Calvin**, **Luther**, **Zwingli**, and the **fathers**, with occasional reference to **Turretin** and **Vermigli** to secure **Reformed scholastic** consensus. On eschatology, he is indebted to **Vos** and **Ridderbos**, sparring with **dispensational** expositors and opposing **hyper-preterists** while benefitting from partial preterist insights associated with **R. C. Sproul**. Across these fields, Mathison’s commitments exhibit a stable confessional spine rooted in **Westminster** theology and a pastoral aim shaped by the teaching ministry of **Ligonier**.

Reformed and Westminster Seminary evaluation: Mathison’s strengths are considerable. His articulation of **sola Scriptura** as **Tradition I** powerfully clarifies the **ministerial** place of tradition, excellently consonant with **Westminster Confession 1** and a Van Tilian stress on **principia** where God’s self-attesting Word governs all knowledge. His **Calvinian** account of the **Lord’s Supper** is a salutary correction of **memorialism**, recovering objective grace in the means of grace while preserving the finality of Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice. His **partial preterism** guards against exegetical sensationalism and affirms the church’s historical mission. Yet two cautions arise. First, in practice, the appeal to consensual **patristic** voices could risk functioning as a quasi-norm if not constantly re-situated under the sanctuary of **Scripture alone**, especially when consensus is thin or contested. Second, his **postmillennialism** and AD 70 readings, though carefully bounded, may press certain prophetic idioms beyond the balance many **Westminster** theologians find in **amillennial** constructions that hold mission and suffering in tighter eschatological tension. A Westminster path forward would affirm Mathison’s **sola Scriptura**, his **Calvinian sacramentology**, and his covenantal hermeneutic, while permitting principled diversity on millennium questions and maintaining the primacy of redemptive-historical preaching that keeps cross and kingdom inseparably joined.
