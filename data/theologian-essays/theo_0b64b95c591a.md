### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the apologetic horizon
Simon Turpin emerges as a British **evangelical** apologist whose work has been forged within the institutional and rhetorical environment of **Answers in Genesis** in the UK, at once catechetical and polemical in tone, and public-facing in its defense of **biblical authority**. His ministry tracks with post-2000 cultural shifts in Britain and Europe, where aggressive **secularization** and a technocratic confidence in **evolutionary science** have pressed churches toward either accommodation or a renewal of **confessional** clarity. In this setting Turpin positions the doctrine of **creation** and the **historical Adam** as a frontline issue, on the conviction that **Genesis 1–11** operates as the foundational narrative for **federal headship**, **original sin**, and Christ as **Last Adam**. The intellectual horizon is therefore both ancient and contemporary: the **Augustinian** inheritance of **original sin** and the **Pauline** Adam-Christ typology in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**, refracted through late modern debates over **methodological naturalism**, **uniformitarianism**, and the place of **general revelation**.

Turpin's institutional home within **AiG** also locates him within a transatlantic coalition of **young-earth creationists** influenced by **Henry Morris**, **John Whitcomb**, and **Ken Ham**, yet methodologically grounded in a presuppositional tradition shaped by **Cornelius Van Til** and **Greg Bahnsen**. That alignment yields a characteristic posture: rejection of **neutrality** in science and history, insistence that **Scripture** is the ultimate criterion for truth, and a readiness to read both ancient **ANE** texts and modern scientific claims through the **analogia fidei**. Against the background of **BioLogos** style **theistic evolution** and **old-earth** apologetics such as **Hugh Ross**, Turpin contends that the church surrenders gospel coherence when it relinquishes the historical character of **Genesis**.

#### 2. Method: Sola Scriptura, presuppositions, and hermeneutics
Turpin's method can be summarized as **Sola Scriptura** with **presuppositional apologetics** in service of a **grammatical-historical** reading of **Genesis** as history. He appeals explicitly to the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** and to the premodern conviction that the Bible is the self-interpreting Word of God, constrained by the **analogia Scripturae**. The epistemic claim is straightforward: because all reasoning is covenantally conditioned by the **noetic effects of sin**, there is no such thing as neutral **methodological naturalism**; scientific practice must be ministerial under **Scripture**, not magisterial over it. Thus the categories of **creation ex nihilo**, **six ordinary days**, **a global Flood**, and a single human pair in **Adam and Eve** are treated as divinely revealed realities, not hypothesis space.

Hermeneutically, Turpin resists non-literal proposals such as the **framework hypothesis** associated with **Meredith Kline**, the **analogical days** proposal advanced by **C. John Collins**, or the **cosmic temple** reading of **John Walton**, on the grounds that these tend to relativize the time-bound markers and genealogical tethering within **Genesis 1–11**. He emphasizes the concrete terms **yom** with evening and morning, the genealogical formulae that anchor **Adam** to later history, and the intertextual appeal to **Exodus 20:11**, where the decalogue grounds the work-rest pattern in six days of divine work. For Turpin, such textual indicators establish the genre as historical narrative infused with theological meaning rather than mythic or liturgical symbolism.

#### 3. Key works and doctrinal center: Adam, sin, and the gospel
The doctrinal center of Turpin's public theology orbits around **Adam** as the **federal head** and the consequent structure of **original sin** and **redemption**. In writings such as **Adam: The First and the Last** from 2018 and many **AiG** essays, he argues that the Pauline Adam-Christ typology in **Romans 5:12–21** and **1 Corinthians 15:21–22, 45–49** presupposes and requires a historical, de novo **creation of Adam** from the dust and **Eve** from Adam. Turpin articulates a classically **Augustinian** view: through the one man **Adam**, sin and death entered the world for all humanity, establishing the necessity for a second representative, the **Last Adam**, Jesus Christ, whose obedience and resurrection secure justification and life for those united to him.

This soteriological structure entails further cosmological claims. Turpin maintains that there was no **nephesh chayyah** animal death, bloodshed, or predation prior to the **Fall**, arguing that the world originally was very good in a robust sense incompatible with the deep time of **uniformitarian** geology that saturates creation with death before sin. He insists on a **global Flood** in the days of **Noah**, not a local event, appealing to the universals within **Genesis 6–9**, the covenant with all flesh, and the tectonic and sedimentary signatures he reads as consistent with catastrophic processes. The **Tower of Babel** is read as a historical dispersion of peoples and languages, which then structures his engagement with contemporary questions of race, ethnicity, and the unity of the human family in **Acts 17:26**.

#### 4. Science, history, and authority: the noetic challenge
Turpin's deployment of **presuppositional apologetics** centers on the claim that all scientific inference is worldview-laden, and that the reigning methodological limits of **naturalism** cannot adjudicate claims that are historical and theological at once. He cites the **noetic effects of sin** in suppressing the truth in unrighteousness, echoing **Romans 1**, to explain why modern scientific culture resists **creation** and **providence**. For him, **general revelation** is real yet often misunderstood apart from the interpretive light of **special revelation**; nature is a clear theater of divine glory but is read rightly only through Scripture's spectacles.

This leads to a particular way of negotiating evidence. Turpin distinguishes between **operational science** that studies repeatable processes and **historical science** that reconstructs unrepeatable past events, contending that Christians should be confident in the former while refusing to grant the latter autonomous authority when it contradicts **Genesis**. That distinction underwrites his openness to scientific practice in medicine and technology and his caution about deep-time narratives in geology or common descent in biology. The upshot is a model of **scientia ministerialis**, a ministerial science that serves rather than rivals **biblical authority**.

#### 5. Interlocutors and polemics: BioLogos, old-earth creationism, and mytho-history
Turpin's public engagement has been sharpened by interlocutors across the evangelical spectrum. He critiques **BioLogos** voices such as **Francis Collins** and **Peter Enns** for advocating **evolutionary creation**, which, in his reading, dissolves the coherence of **original sin** and destabilizes **Christology** by severing **Adam** from historical reality. He opposes **Hugh Ross** and **Reasons to Believe** for adopting **old-earth progressive creation**, arguing that this view fractures the biblical story by placing millions of years of animal death prior to **Adam**, undermining the **very good** creation and the penal character of the **Fall**.

More recently, Turpin has targeted **William Lane Craig** and his proposal of **mytho-history** in **In Quest of the Historical Adam** from 2021. He argues that Craig's reclassification of **Genesis 1–11** as a mytho-historical genre introduces epistemic instability to the **Adam-Christ** parallel, since a figure hedged by myth may lack the concrete genealogical and federal specificity Paul assumes. Turpin also resists **John Walton's** "cosmic temple" approach as collapsing ontological claims about **creation** into functional discourse about order and vocation. Against the **framework hypothesis** associated with **Meredith Kline** and **analogical days** from **C. John Collins**, Turpin insists that genre and analogy cannot overturn the plain sense of **six ordinary days** testified by the creation week and the sabbath command in **Exodus 20:11**.

#### 6. Ecclesial and pastoral motivations: catechesis, culture, and mission
Turpin's ministry is not merely academic; it is pastoral and catechetical. Through **AiG** conferences, church training, and published resources, he frames **Genesis** as the catechetical backbone for Christian identity in a secular age. He connects the denial of **biblical authority** in origins to ethical confusions about **marriage**, **gender**, and the sanctity of life, arguing that the cultural plausibility of Christian ethics depends on the church's confidence in the **creation order**. The emphasis on one human race from **Adam**, and the dispersion from **Babel**, is leveraged to counter **racism** and to ground missions in a unified doctrine of humanity.

In evangelism, Turpin employs **creation-fall-redemption-restoration** as a canonical metanarrative, with **Adam** and **Christ** as the structural hubs. He contends that apologetics must expose the idolatrous presuppositions of naturalism and invite hearers to receive **Scripture** as the self-authenticating Word of God through the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit**. This pneumatological note echoes **Reformed** confidence in **Scripture's** sufficiency and clarity, even as Turpin presses for cultural courage and ecclesial resolve.

#### 7. Strengths and distinctives: coherence, clarity, and courage
The enduring contribution of Turpin's work is the consistent mapping of **biblical authority** onto the structure of **soteriology**, rendering **Genesis** integral rather than peripheral to gospel proclamation. By foregrounding **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**, he presses the church to consider how deeply **federal theology** presupposes a historical **Adam**. His persistent use of the **analogia fidei** to read **Genesis** with **Paul** and **Moses**, and his insistence that science as **ministerial** must submit to **Scripture**, provide a clear and coherent apologetic. The rhetoric of **no neutrality**, drawn from **Van Til** and **Bahnsen**, grants his approach an internal consistency often missing from evidentialist strategies.

Turpin also exemplifies institutional courage in confronting well-resourced platforms like **BioLogos** and widely respected figures like **William Lane Craig**. His responses model how **evangelical** theology can engage analytic and biblical scholarship with clarity while upholding lay-accessible catechesis. Even those who demur at his conclusions can acknowledge the pastoral benefit of connecting **creation**, **sin**, and **redemption** in a single, intelligible narrative that anchors Christian ethics and mission.

#### 8. Reformed and WTS evaluation: appreciations and cautions
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, several appreciations are immediate. Turpin's **Sola Scriptura** posture, his embrace of **presuppositional apologetics** shaped by **Van Til**, and his insistence on the **Adam-Christ** parallel resonate with the **Westminster Standards**. His defense of **six-day creation** has a textual foothold in **WCF 4.1**, and his concerns about **noetic effects of sin** and the impossibility of **neutrality** in science align with Westminster's **covenantal epistemology**. His reading of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** as dogmatic anchors for **original sin** and **federal headship** is deeply **Augustinian** and coheres with classic **Reformed orthodoxy**.

Yet several cautions arise in principle. First, there is a risk of collapsing **genre** and **history** if the grammatical-historical method is not combined with a robust doctrine of **accommodation** and a calibrated account of literary form as affirmed by **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and some **Klinean** exegesis; **Reformed** theology has room for recognizing **figurative** texture without relativizing truth. Second, Turpin's operational-historical science distinction can harden into a false dichotomy if it implies that **general revelation** lacks evidential force apart from explicit citation of **special revelation**; **Reformed** theology has often affirmed a principled compatibility of **general revelation** and properly ordered **natural philosophy** under Christ's kingship. Third, the insistence on a uniquely **young-earth** chronology may be stated more dogmatically than the catholic creeds require; while **ordinary-day** creation is a live and defensible option in **Reformed** theology, alternatives such as **analogical days** have been argued by confessional theologians without surrendering **biblical authority**. A constructive alternative within **classical Reformed** thought would press the same covenantal stakes in **Adam** and **Christ**, maintain **inerrancy**, and uphold **divine sovereignty** while allowing a more expansive account of **genre**, **accommodation**, and the ministerial use of **general revelation**. The central Reformed principle remains: revelation governs reason, covenantal history interprets nature, and **grace** restores **nature** without collapsing the integrity of either.
