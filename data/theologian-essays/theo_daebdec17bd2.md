### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and confessional method
Cornelis P. Venema emerged as a contemporary dogmatician within the Dutch-American Reformed world, shaped by the **Three Forms of Unity** and in critical conversation with the **Westminster Standards**. His ministerial and academic vocation coalesced at **Mid-America Reformed Seminary** in Dyer, Indiana, formed in the early 1980s as a confessional alternative during turbulence in the Christian Reformed Church. From the late twentieth century onward, **Venema** cultivated a pastor-theologian profile that weds churchly catechesis to scholarly retrieval. The methodological hallmark is a confessional exegesis in which Scripture exercises supreme authority, the **Belgic Confession**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Canons of Dort** supply dogmatic grammar, and catholic orthodoxy is received as subordinate norm. He consistently reads the economy of salvation through a redemptive-historical lens that honors inaugurated eschatology, while insisting on the clarity of the *ordo salutis* and the forensic center of the gospel. The result is a method that is retrievalist and polemically nimble, fit to address **dispensationalism**, the **New Perspective on Paul**, and the **Federal Vision**.

#### 2. Intellectual lineage and ecclesial setting
The intellectual lineage of **Venema** is unmistakably Augustinian and Reformational, mediated by **Calvin**, **Herman Bavinck**, and the constructive concerns of **G. C. Berkouwer**. In eschatology he stands downstream from **Anthony A. Hoekema**, whose The Bible and the Future prepared the ground for a mature **amillennialism** that is both biblical and ecclesial. His training in doctrinal history included focused research on the Reformation and post-Reformation, evident in his ongoing use of **Bullinger**, **Dort**, and **Westminster** as interpretive partners for contemporary dogmatics. The ecclesial setting is the **United Reformed Churches in North America**, where confessional integrity and worship practice are central. From that base, **Venema** writes as a steward of the public doctrine of the church, addressing soteriological and sacramental pressures that face catechized congregations, and doing so with the cadence of a seminary president who expects the **Three Forms of Unity** to regulate ministerial formation and pastoral counsel.

#### 3. Method under pressure, Scripture and confession in concert
Under modern pressure points, **Venema** presses Scripture and confession into concert. His dogmatics treats Scripture as the self-authenticating norm, yet his exegesis is never isolated from the ecclesial rule of faith embodied in the **Belgic Confession** and **Westminster Confession**. He is critical of revisionist trajectories that subordinate the forensic to the participatory in accounts of **union with Christ**, or that reduce Paul’s doctrine of justification to the sociology of covenant membership as in the **New Perspective on Paul**. He grants the already and the not yet of redemptive history, yet he rejects any eschatological schema that fractures the unity of the people of God or multiplies resurrections and judgments. His hermeneutic is analytic and constructive in equal measure, staging careful engagements with **Roman Catholic** Tridentine soteriology, with **dispensational premillennialism**, and with Reformed intramural debates over **republication** in the **Mosaic covenant**. Through each controversy the controlling commitments remain clear, the primacy of **forensic justification**, the integrity of *duplex gratia*, and the objectivity of the covenant administered by word and **sacraments**.

#### 4. Eschatology retrieved, The Promise of the Future 2000
In The Promise of the Future, published in 2000, **Venema** offered a comprehensive **amillennial** account that has become a standard in confessional Reformed circles. Building on **Hoekema** while extending the exegetical case, he argues that the millennium of **Revelation 20** depicts the present reign of Christ and the binding of Satan with respect to the deceiving of the nations. There is one resurrection and one final judgment, not multiple stages distributed across dispensational economies. The church is one people of God, Jew and Gentile in the **covenant of grace**, and the promises to Israel find their telos in Christ and his body. The future state is articulated in terms of resurrection life on a renewed earth, a robust **new creation** theology that refuses escapist spiritualism. He treats the **intermediate state**, the **beatific vision**, and the nature of **hell** with pastoral sobriety and confessional precision. The pastoral horizon of the book is explicit, catechizing the church in hope against both secular utopianisms and Christian millenarianisms, and situating pilgrimage, martyrdom, and liturgical life within a coherent eschatological horizon.

#### 5. Forensic grace defended, The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ 2006
The Gospel of Free Acceptance in Christ, published in 2006, is **Venema’s** principal soteriological polemic and constructive statement on **justification**. He addresses **E. P. Sanders** on covenantal nomism, **J. D. G. Dunn** and **N. T. Wright** on law and righteousness, and he assesses how the **New Perspective on Paul** construes justification as a declaration of ecclesial membership rather than a verdict of divine acquittal grounded in **imputation**. Venema argues that Paul’s righteousness of God is God’s saving righteousness revealed in Christ and reckoned to sinners apart from works of the law, received through faith alone. He defends the **active obedience of Christ** as necessary to the believer’s title to life, distinguishing it from the **passive obedience** that secures the removal of guilt, and he grounds both in federal headship. He rejects two-stage schemas of initial and final justification that make Spirit-wrought obedience co-instrumental, while affirming that the final judgment will be according to works as evidence and vindication. Throughout he reads **Romans 3 to 5** and **Galatians 2 to 3** with the exegetical and dogmatic instincts of the **Reformation**, aligning his conclusions with **Belgic Confession 22 to 24** and **Westminster Confession 11**.

#### 6. Covenant architecture, Christ and Covenant Theology 2017
In Christ and Covenant Theology, published in 2017, **Venema** consolidates decades of work on the architecture of **covenant theology**. He retrieves the classic **covenant of works** with Adam as a real prelapsarian arrangement with a probationary command and a promise of eschatological life, thus safeguarding the law gospel distinction and the federal parallel between Adam and Christ. He affirms the unity of the **covenant of grace** administered diversely across the epochs from Abraham to the new covenant, thereby preserving one church and one way of salvation by grace through faith. He treats **election** and **covenant** with nuance, rejecting the collapse of covenant into election that erases external administration and warning against a mere externalism that forgets the Spirit’s internal work. On the debated question of **republication** in the Mosaic economy, he grants a typological and pedagogical reassertion of the works principle in Israel’s land tenure and cultic life, yet he resists any reconstruction that would deny the substantive unity of Sinai with the covenant of grace. His interlocutors include **Meredith Kline**, whose careful insights he appropriates critically, and **John Murray**, whose reticence about the covenant of works he corrects in the interest of Pauline federalism in **Romans 5** and **First Corinthians 15**.

#### 7. Twofold grace clarified, Accepted and Renewed in Christ 2020
Accepted and Renewed in Christ, released in 2020, represents **Venema’s** systematic exposition of *duplex gratia*, the twofold grace that flows from **union with Christ**, namely **justification** and **sanctification**. He labors to secure both the inseparability and the ordered distinction of these graces, arguing that union with Christ does not erase the forensic priority of justification nor reduce sanctification to an optional sequel. Against pressures from **Roman Catholic** synergism and from certain contemporary evangelical proposals for a **final justification** on the basis of Spirit-wrought obedience, he insists that the instrumentality of faith alone remains unshared, even as good works become necessary as the fruit and evidence of true faith. He retrieves **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and the **Westminster Larger Catechism** on adoption, perseverance, and assurance, showing how assurance is anchored in the promise of the gospel and confirmed by the **sacraments** and the witness of the Spirit rather than achieved by introspective moral calculus. The work is a sustained catechesis in Reformed soteriology, marked by pastoral sensitivity toward tender consciences and a strong theology of the church’s ministry of the keys.

#### 8. Sacramental practice and the paedocommunion debate, Children at the Lord’s Table 2009
In Children at the Lord’s Table, published in 2009, **Venema** addresses the rise of **paedocommunion** within certain Reformed and evangelical circles influenced by **Federal Vision** and catholic liturgical retrievals. He offers a historical, exegetical, and confessional case for the historic Reformed practice of admitting to the **Lord’s Supper** only those who credibly profess faith and can examine themselves in light of **First Corinthians 11**. He distinguishes **baptism** as the sacrament of covenant initiation from the Supper as the sacrament of covenant nourishment, arguing that the latter presupposes catechesis, self-examination, and ecclesial discipline. He engages proponents such as **Peter Leithart** and analyses of ancient church practice, while reminding readers that the **Heidelberg Catechism** and **Belgic Confession** frame the Supper in terms of discerning the Lord’s body by faith. The constructive burden is ecclesial health, catechetical maturity, and the spiritual safety of covenant youth, not exclusionary gatekeeping. By nesting the debate within **covenant theology**, he demonstrates how sacramental integrity flows from clarity about the **covenant of grace** and the nature of faith.

#### 9. Confessional retrieval as dogmatics, The Belgic Confession: A Commentary 2023
The Belgic Confession: A Commentary, appearing in 2023 as a two-volume work, showcases **Venema’s** mature voice as a confessional theologian who reads doctrine with the church. He offers historical introduction to **Guido de Brès** and the sixteenth-century setting, then expounds articles on **Holy Scripture**, **divine simplicity** and the **Trinity**, **creation** and **providence**, **anthropology** and **sin**, **Christology**, **soteriology**, the **church**, **sacraments**, **civil government**, and the **last judgment**. The commentary integrates exegesis, historical theology, and systematic reflection, showing how the confession’s propositions render biblical teaching with catholic scope and Reformation specificity. He reads the confession as a living rule for contemporary controversies, addressing the authority of Scripture against **biblical theology** reductionisms, articulating **Christ’s two natures** against kenotic drift, and stabilizing doctrine of the church against consumerist polity. The volumes model how confessional norms guide pastoral ministry, theological education, and public witness, and they offer an accessible yet rigorous resource for elders and ministers who must teach and defend the church’s faith.

#### 10. Ecclesial dogmatics in polemical context and a Reformed WTS evaluation
Across these projects **Venema** displays a steady habitus of ecclesial dogmatics, resisting academic novelty for its own sake while engaging living questions about **eschatology**, **justification**, **covenant**, and **sacraments**. His polemical work preserves catholic proportions, giving the forensic center of the gospel its due while integrating **union with Christ**, and balancing redemptive-historical sensibility with the system’s architectural bones. The most generative tensions arise around the **Mosaic covenant** and **republication**, where his qualified approach safeguards the unity of the **covenant of grace** yet may understate how typological works principles function in Israel’s national life without confusing them with the order of salvation. A second tension concerns **judgment according to works**, where his refusal of any two-stage justification rightly protects sola fide while calling for ongoing elaboration of the evidentiary role of obedience in a robust doctrine of assurance. From a Reformed and Westminster Seminary vantage, the strengths are pronounced, a careful defense of the **active obedience of Christ**, a seasoned articulation of **amillennial eschatology**, a confessional account of *duplex gratia*, and a pastoral handling of **sacramental practice**. If an alternative accent were sought, it would be to deepen the ontology of **covenant communion** without jeopardizing forensic priority, to sharpen the typological law gospel dialectic in **Sinai**, and to appropriate broader catholic metaphysics, for example the clarity of **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, in even fuller dogmatic detail. Yet on the central axes of revelation, covenant, grace, history, and nature, **Venema** stands squarely within classical Reformed orthodoxy and renders that inheritance serviceable for the church.
