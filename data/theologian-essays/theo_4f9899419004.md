### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and humanist method
Huldrych **Zwingli** was born in **Wildhaus** in 1484 and educated at **Vienna** and **Basel**, where **Erasmian humanism** furnished his intellectual grammar of **ad fontes**, philology, and moral reform. Ordained at **Glarus** in 1506 and later at **Einsiedeln**, he absorbed the Swiss mercenary and pastoral crises while mastering **Greek** and **Hebrew** in service of **Scripture’s** original sense. In 1519 he was called to the **Grossmünster** in **Zurich**, inaugurating a program of lectio continua from **Matthew** that embodied **sola Scriptura** and rejected **scholastic quaestiones**. The plague of 1519 occasioned his **Pestlied**, revealing a piety shaped by **providence** and **Christ’s sufficiency**. The **Sixty-Seven Articles 1523** distilled this trajectory in public form: the **gospel’s final authority**, the repudiation of **human traditions**, and the subjection of ecclesial practice to **clear Scripture**. Zwingli’s early formation thus united **humanist philology** and **evangelical conviction** within the civic rhythms of a Swiss canton awakening to reform.

Zwingli’s method was defined by a rigorous **Spirit and Word** axiom. For him, the **Holy Spirit** is lord, not prisoner, of the **biblical text**; yet the Spirit binds Himself to the **literal-historical sense** discerned through **grammatical exegesis** and canonical reading. He opposed **allegorical excess** and **scholastic syllogisms**, insisting that doctrine be deduced by manifest **Scripture testimony** and tested in public **disputation**. The establishment of the **Prophezei 1525**, a daily exercise in Hebrew and Greek for Zurich’s clergy, institutionalized a method combining **philology**, pastoral **catechesis**, and civic oversight. Influenced by **Augustine** on **signs**, by **Erasmus** on literary clarity, and by **Bernard** on pastoral care, he forged a hermeneutic that prized **claritas Scripturae** and the *sensus literalis* under the eschatological lordship of **Christ**.

#### 2. Civic reformation and ecclesial polity
The **First Zurich Disputation January 1523** and the **Second October 1523** showcased Zwingli’s confidence in **public Scripture** to adjudicate doctrine before magistrates and clergy. The outcome was sweeping: the removal of **images**, reform of **fasts**, and interrogation of **clerical vows** as lacking **biblical warrant**. Between 1524 and 1525 Zurich embraced **iconoclasm** and abolished the **Mass**, replacing it in 1525 with a **vernacular Supper** structured by **anamnēsis** and preaching. Zwingli championed a cooperative model of **magistracy** and ministerium in which the council, guided by the **Word**, governs outward order and enforces ecclesial discipline. Ecclesiology was thus **civic-communal**, not monastic or episcopal: the church as the gathered **fidelium** within a Christian commonwealth under **Christ’s kingship** but administered by **godly magistrates**.

This civic reform sharpened tensions with the **Anabaptists**, notably **Conrad Grebel** and **Felix Manz**, initially allies in biblical renewal. Disagreements over **infant baptism**, **oaths**, and the place of **magistracy** precipitated rupture. Zwingli’s **On Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism 1525** defended **paedobaptism** as a **covenant sign** and rejected sectarian rebaptism as a denial of the church’s public unity. His **Refutation of the Tricks of the Catabaptists 1527** developed a theology of **visible church** and **civil order** that placed discipline primarily under **public authority**. The tragic drowning of **Felix Manz 1527** symbolizes the hard edge of Zwingli’s **Erastian** strategy and the contested birth of **Reformed** polity.

#### 3. Sacramental architecture: sign, Word, and faith
Zwingli’s account of the **sacraments** was architected by the **signum et res** distinction derived from **Augustine**, reshaped by his **Spirit-Word** principle and concern for **idolatry**. In **De vera et falsa religione 1525** he defined sacraments as divine **signs and seals** of covenant grace that pledge God’s favor to faith, not magical conduits of grace **ex opere operato**. The sacraments are subordinate **ministeria** of the **Word**, stirring faith through **anamnēsis** and public confession. In the Supper, the **bread and wine** do not contain or convey **Christ’s body** locally; rather, believers are raised by the **Spirit** to the ascended **Christ** at the **right hand of God**, feeding spiritually through **faith**. The grammar is covenantal and doxological: the sacrament as **pledge**, **memorial**, and **corporate witness**, not as an ontological transformation.

Zwingli’s **Amica exegesis 1527** developed a sustained exegesis of the words of institution. He argued that hoc est corpus meum employs **sacramental metaphor** common in Scripture, where the **name of the thing** is predicated of the **sign**. The term est, he insisted, can bear the sense of **significat**, a reading he defended by appeal to biblical idiom and **patristic usage**. He marshaled the axiom **finitum non capax infiniti** to deny any local inclusion of the **divine** in the **eucharistic elements**, while affirming that the **ascended Christ** communicates himself truly to faith. This symbolic realism is spare and anti-idolatrous, aiming to protect **Christ’s natures** and the integrity of **worship**.

#### 4. The Marburg impasse and the Lutheran divide
The **Marburg Colloquy 1529** crystallized Zwingli’s dispute with **Martin Luther** on the **Lord’s Supper**. Luther inscribed in chalk, **Hoc est corpus meum**, and refused to cede the literal force of est or the **real bodily presence**, while Zwingli defended **signum et res** and **anamnēsis** under the rule of **Christ’s ascension**. Zwingli rejected **ubiquity** as a violation of **Chalcedonian** Christology and insisted that the **right hand of God** denotes a royal location and dignity, not a claim of spatial omnipresence of the **human nature**. The colloquy produced fifteen articles of agreement, leaving the Supper unresolved and prefiguring the fractured **evangelical** front before imperial politics. Engagements with **Johannes Oecolampadius**, who also affirmed a **spiritual feeding**, and with **Martin Bucer**, who sought a mediating formula of **spiritual real presence**, refined Zwingli’s language but did not alter his conviction that the Supper’s efficacy is by **Spirit and faith** rather than by any localized presence in the **elements**.

Zwingli’s polemics against **transubstantiation** and **consubstantiation** were driven by his fear of **idolatry** and by his sense of **biblical clarity**. He saw the medieval Mass as obscuring the once-for-all **atonement** and subverting the **priesthood of Christ**. The Zurich churches implemented a Supper that centered on **preaching**, **congregational participation**, and **covenant renewal**, thus shaping the emerging **Reformed liturgy** distinct from **Lutheran** patterns. Though his idiom of **memorial** was sometimes heard as reduction, he meant by it a robust **covenantal remembrance** that enacts allegiance and receives **Christ’s benefits** through trust.

#### 5. Baptism, covenant, and the public church
Zwingli’s baptismal theology is inseparable from his vision of a **covenant people** constituted publicly under **magistracy**. Against the **Anabaptists**, he argued that **infant baptism** is warranted by the continuity of **covenant signs** from **circumcision** to **baptism**, by the corporate nature of **promise**, and by the church’s duty to nurture **children of believers** within discipline and catechesis. **On Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism 1525** frames baptism as a **sign and pledge** of God’s favor that marks entry into the **visible church** without presuming **regeneration**. Faith remains the instrument of receiving **Christ**, yet the **sign** is bestowed to bind the household to **instruction** and to the **public confession** of the gospel.

This **federal** logic governed his broader ecclesiology. Church discipline, preaching, catechesis, and sacramental administration are corporate acts under **Scripture**, supervised in Zurich by **council** and pastors together. Zwingli’s stress on **public order** made the church genuinely **catholic** in scope though sharply purified in practice, curbing **images**, **pilgrimages**, and **vows** as non-biblical. The Geneva model would later refine internal **consistory discipline**, yet Zwingli laid the groundwork for **Reformed church order** as a civic covenant, steered by the **Word** toward communal holiness.

#### 6. God, providence, and the moral world
Zwingli’s doctrine of God, particularly in **De providentia 1530**, advanced a comprehensive **providence**. All events fall under God’s **voluntas** and **praedestinatio**, a theme he deployed both as **theodicy** and pastoral assurance. His tone can sound **Stoic** to later ears, yet he anchored determination in the goodness of **divine wisdom** and the **cross of Christ**. The will of God does not remove **human responsibility** or the need for **law** to curb vice. He spoke of the **lex** as divine pedagogy, ordering society toward **justice** and exposing sin, while the **gospel** grants **forgiveness** and the **Spirit** empowers **virtue**. Zwingli affirmed original **sin**, the necessity of **grace**, and **faith** as God’s gift, yet his rhetoric on **free choice** occasionally tilts toward a civic moralism contrasted with **Luther’s** sharper **law-gospel** dialectic.

Christologically, Zwingli guarded **Chalcedonian** boundaries and defended **Christ’s two natures** with the axiom **finitum non capax infiniti** to deny any collapse of the **human nature** into the **divine**. He thus anticipated the **extra Calvinisticum** conviction that the **Logos** is not circumscribed by the flesh, a corollary vital to his Eucharistic stance and to a robust doctrine of **ascension**. Soteriologically, he emphasized **union with Christ** by **faith**, not by sacramental **ingestion**, aligning justification with **sola fide** and sanctification with **Spirit-led obedience** within the civic commonwealth.

#### 7. Confessions, diplomacy, and death
The 1530s pressed Zwingli into confessional and diplomatic labors. His **Fidei ratio 1530** presented to **Charles V** articulated **sola Scriptura**, **justification by faith**, **two-natures Christology**, **sacrament as sign**, and a plea for toleration of **evangelical** reform. In **Expositio fidei 1531** he offered a coherent summary of **Zurich** doctrine with irenic tones toward **South German** reformers. Politically, he favored an alliance of **evangelical cities** to counter Habsburg pressure, a strategy entangled with Swiss **cantonal** rivalries. The **First Peace of Kappel 1529** secured a fragile settlement, but the **Second Kappel War 1531** shattered it. Serving as **chaplain** on the field, Zwingli fell at **Kappel** on 11 October 1531, sealing his ministry with a death that many contemporaries construed as martyrdom for **gospel truth** and civic duty.

His immediate legacy passed to **Heinrich Bullinger**, whose **Decades** and the **Second Helvetic Confession 1566** codified a more expansive **Reformed** theology, moderating Zwingli’s idiom on the **Supper** toward a richer **spiritual presence** while retaining his commitments to **Scripture**, **providence**, **covenant**, and **worship reformation**. The Zurich **Kirchenordnung 1525** and the **Prophezei** continued to train ministers in **philology** and **exegesis**, feeding wider **Reformed** networks in the Rhineland, England, and Scotland. Through controversy and consolidation, Zwingli’s Zurich became a seedbed for **Reformed identity**.

#### 8. Theology in texture: strengths and limits
Zwingli’s theology coheres around several signature textures: a trust in **claritas Scripturae**, a polemical concern for **idolatry**, a robust doctrine of **ascension** and **providence**, and a civic vision of the **church** under **magistracy**. His **humanist** training gave him a supple exegesis and a reforming impulse to interrogate all practice by **biblical warrant**. His sacramental vision preserved **Christ’s once-for-all sacrifice** and resisted **sacerdotalism**, while his **covenant** theme integrated households into the public fabric of **discipleship**. At the same time, his rhetorical economy risked thinness: the Supper became for many hearers a bare **memorial**, his **providence** shaded toward determinism, and his **Erastian** polity muted the internal **discipline** of the keys.

The dialectic between **Word** and **Spirit** stands out as Zwingli’s most fruitful principle. He insisted that the **Spirit** precedes and empowers the **Word’s** reception, preventing textualism and insisting on divine sovereignty in **illumination**. Yet this very insistence raised questions about the **sacramental Word**, whether the **visible words** bear a divinely instituted efficacy beyond cognitive **remembrance**. Later **Reformed** theology would honor his anti-magic polemic while enriching the sacramental account through **union with Christ** and **Spirit-mediated communion**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Seminary vantage, Zwingli’s achievement commands deep gratitude and careful correction. Positively, his **sola Scriptura** rigor, **Spirit and Word** axiom, defense of **Christ’s heavenly session**, rejection of **idolatry**, and **covenant** grounding of **paedobaptism** align with the **Westminster Confession** on Scripture, Christ, worship, and the church. His insistence on **finitum non capax infiniti** safeguards **Chalcedonian** integrity and anticipates the **extra Calvinisticum** cherished in **Reformed Christology**. His **providence** and **praedestinatio** fortify divine sovereignty and pastoral assurance. Critically, however, his Eucharistic **memorialism** undercuts the confession’s teaching that sacraments are **means of grace** wherein by the **Spirit** and through **faith** believers truly partake of **Christ** and his benefits. A Westminster alternative accentuates **spiritual real presence** and **sacramental union**, moving beyond mere **significat** to a Spirit-wrought **communicatio** of the res. In ecclesiology, Zwingli’s **Erastian** reliance on **magistracy** compromises the spiritual independence of **church discipline**; classic Reformed two-kingdoms distinctions commend a **ministerial church** wielding the keys under **Christ**, with the civil power limited to **temporal justice**. Finally, his strong **determinism** can obscure **covenant administration**, **common grace**, and the organic rhythm of **law and gospel** across redemptive history. The **Westminster Standards** supply a richer account of the **covenant of works and covenant of grace**, a thicker sacramental efficacy, and a more balanced doctrine of **providence** that preserves both God’s meticulous sovereignty and the real significance of secondary causes. The best Reformed reception of **Zwingli** therefore receives his Scriptural courage and Christological clarity while adopting **Calvin’s spiritual presence** and the confessional balance of **Word**, **sacrament**, and **church**.
