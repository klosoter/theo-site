### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Kim Riddlebarger’s theological project emerges within a late twentieth-century American setting where **evangelical dispensationalism** dominated popular eschatology and where a confessional resurgence among Reformed churches reclaimed **catechism**, **creeds**, and **Word and sacrament** ministry. Trained within the **Westminster** tradition and completing doctoral work in **historical theology**, he ministers as an ordained pastor in the **United Reformed Churches in North America** and served for decades as a co-host on the **White Horse Inn**. This public platform sharpened his vocation: to articulate a robust **amillennial** reading of Scripture that is biblical-theological, historically Reformed, and pastorally clarifying. His milieu includes the **URCNA** formation in 1996, ongoing conversations with **Westminster Seminary California**, and the broader **Modern Reformation** movement, all insisting that the church’s life be normed by **confessional orthodoxy** rather than evangelical novelty.

Riddlebarger’s method is self-consciously **redemptive-historical**, indebted to **Geerhardus Vos** on the unfolding of **revelation-history** and to **Anthony Hoekema** on **inaugurated eschatology**. He reads Scripture through **analogia fidei** Scripture interprets Scripture, employs **typology** rather than atomistic literalism, and privileges canonical context over newspaper exegesis. His hermeneutic treats **Revelation** as a symbolic, pastoral apocalypse crafted in cycles of **recapitulation**, and reads **Daniel**, the **Olivet Discourse**, and **Pauline eschatology** through the master contrast of **two-age eschatology** this age and the age to come. Underlying this is a confessional commitment to **covenant theology**, to the church’s pilgrim identity marked by **means of grace**, and to the alternation of **law and gospel** in preaching.

Biographically, Riddlebarger’s pastoral base in Southern California’s **Christ Reformed Church** situated him at a cultural crossroads of megachurch evangelicalism and resurgent confessional **Reformed** ministry. He teaches and writes from within the **Three Forms of Unity** and the **Westminster Standards**, insisting that doctrinal development is not innovation but retrieval. Instructors like **Meredith Kline** left their imprint on his covenantal reading of judgment-intrusion and the already-not-yet shape of the kingdom, even as he critically engages **theonomy** and **postmillennial triumphalism** as departures from a pilgrim ecclesiology.

#### 2. Major works and doctrinal center
Riddlebarger’s signature is **A Case for Amillennialism** 2003; rev. 2013, which proceeds by hermeneutical prolegomena, exegesis of disputed texts, and theological synthesis. The prolegomena argue for the **analogia fidei** and the **Christological fulfillment** of promise, contending that to insist on a literalistic fulfillment of land or temple is to deny the **telos in Christ**. The exegesis centers on **Revelation 20**, where the **thousand years** symbolizes the completeness of the inter-advent reign of Christ. The binding of **Satan** restricts his deceiving the nations, enabling the global mission of the church; the **first resurrection** is the believer’s translation to heavenly reign at death and the inaugurated resurrection life given in union with Christ; the **second death** is final judgment. He adds careful treatments of **Daniel 7–9**, **Matthew 24**, and **Romans 11**, showing how recapitulation, typology, and the two-age schema cohere.

The method yields his core doctrinal claims. First, **Israel and the church** are one people of God in different historical administrations of the **covenant of grace**, with **Christ** as the true Israel and the church as the **eschatological Israel** by union with him. Second, the **kingdom of God** is present in power yet veiled, pressing a churchly identity marked by the cross rather than by political triumph. Third, the **millennium** is now, a heavenly reality perceived by faith, awaiting consummation at the **parousia**. Fourth, judgment and salvation flow together in the *consummatio*, so that there is one climactic return of Christ with resurrection, judgment, and new creation, rather than a staggered scheme of **rapture**, **tribulation**, and multiple resurrections.

In **The Man of Sin** 2006, Riddlebarger extends the amillennial hermeneutic to the identity of **Antichrist**. He synthesizes **2 Thessalonians 2**, **1 and 2 John**, **Daniel 7–12**, and **Revelation 13**, arguing for a both-and pattern: many antichrists within the course of the age alongside a climactic, personal **man of lawlessness** accompanying the final apostasy. He rejects narrowing Antichrist to the **papacy** alone while recognizing why **Reformation** polemic highlighted Rome, and he refuses historicist schemes that tie Antichrist to particular emperors or modern states. The **temple of God** in 2 Thessalonians 2 is the visible church, not a rebuilt sanctuary; the **lying signs and wonders** are satanic counterfeits that will deceive the unwary within the sphere of professed Christianity. The point, for him, is pastoral vigilance rather than speculative timelines.

#### 3. Exegetical decisions and polemical edges
Riddlebarger’s persuasive force arises from concrete exegesis of the classic pressure points. In **Matthew 24**, he follows a Vosian trajectory that reads Jesus’s **Olivet Discourse** as near-far prophecy with telescoping fulfillment: the fall of Jerusalem in AD 70 as a type of the end, not the end itself. This clarifies the relation of **tribulation** and **gospel mission**, cures the itch to locate the parousia in political headlines, and reassures that the church’s mission will not fail. In **Daniel 9**, he locates the **seventy weeks** within covenantal judgment and restoration, fulfilled in Christ’s ministry and the destruction of the old order, rather than projecting the final week into a dispensational future. In **Revelation**, he reads the **seven cycles** as parallel accounts of the same inter-advent drama, each culminating in the end, so that **Revelation 20** does not follow temporally after **Revelation 19** but retells the story from a different angle.

Against **dispensational premillennialism**, Riddlebarger exposes the hermeneutical axiom of a strict literalism that dislocates prophetic symbolism and divides God’s people into an earthly **Israel** and a heavenly **church**. He answers with the **analogia fidei**, arguing that the New Testament interprets the Old by revealing **Christ** as the substance of type and shadow, such that land, temple, and throne are transfigured in the **new creation** and the **Messiah’s reign**. Against **historic premillennialism** associated with **G. E. Ladd**, he appreciates the inaugurated eschatology but concludes that the case for a future earthly millennium imposes a mediating epoch foreign to the **two-age** contrast that saturates the New Testament. His polemic is never mere negation but insists that eschatology is a function of **Christology** and **ecclesiology**.

He also contends with **postmillennialism** and **theonomy**. Here he invokes **Meredith Kline’s** account of intrusion ethics to argue that attempts to sacralize civil order in the present age misread the epochal distinction between this age and the age to come. The church’s mandate is ministerial, bound to **Word and sacrament** and marked by **law and gospel**, not dominion by civil law as such. He affirms cultural engagement under **common grace** but denies that biblical prophecy warrants an era of visible Christian geopolitical dominance prior to the **parousia**. Thus his amillennialism carries an implicit **two-kingdoms** sensibility, though he grounds it in the **confessions** rather than in sociological theory.

#### 4. Israel, the nations, and Romans 11
A persistent question concerns **Romans 11** and the future of **Israel**. Riddlebarger navigates between the Scylla of **supersessionism** caricature and the Charybdis of **dispensational restorationism**. He argues that **all Israel** refers to the fullness of elect Jews across history with the plausible expectation of a future intensification of Jewish conversion near the end. Yet he refuses to grant an eschatological reversion to land, temple, or Davidic polity, since the **covenant of grace** reaches its telos in **Christ**, who is the true seed and the locus of inheritance. The **one olive tree** image is decisive: there is no parallel plan for Israel and the church. This allows him to affirm missional hope for the Jewish people without sacrificing the **unity of the church** or the finality of **new covenant** fulfillment.

This same logic governs his reading of **Hebrews** on priesthood and sanctuary. The **heavenly Mount Zion** has eclipsed the earthly patterns, and any expectation of a reconstituted sacrificial economy is, for him, a denial of the **once-for-all** efficacy of Christ’s cross. The pastoral effect is to anchor the believer’s hope in the **already** of union with Christ, the **firstfruits** of the age to come, while waiting for the **not yet** of bodily resurrection and cosmic renewal.

#### 5. Antichrist, apostasy, and pastoral vigilance
Riddlebarger’s treatment of **Antichrist** is not a specialized curiosity but a laboratory for his broader theological method. He shows that the **Johannine antichrists** are doctrinal deceivers denying the **incarnation**, while the **man of lawlessness** concentrates the motif in a final figure. His reading guards against two errors: historicist over-specification and reduction of Antichrist to institutional opponents. He grants the **Reformation** insight that antichristly patterns appear in ecclesial forms that obscure the **gospel**, such as a sacerdotal system that eclipses **justification by faith**, yet he insists the final deception is trans-ecclesial and global. The **strong delusion** of 2 Thessalonians 2 is therefore not a puzzle to solve but a summons to a ministry of **truth**, catechesis in the **confessions**, and perseverance under **means of grace**.

This concern folds into a wider pastoral agenda. As a preacher of the **Heidelberg Catechism**, Riddlebarger regularly aligns doctrinal exposition with the rhythms of consolation and obedience: comfort in the one **Mediator**, gratitude expressed in **law and gospel**, and life in the church’s **worship** as a counter-liturgy to the imperial claims of the **beast**. His amillennialism is thus not speculative but parish-oriented, equipping ordinary saints to discern false hopes, endure tribulation, and live as citizens of the **heavenly commonwealth**.

#### 6. Hermeneutics under pressure: Revelation 20 and recapitulation
At the heart of controversy is his defense of **recapitulation** in **Revelation**. Riddlebarger contends that John’s visions are a spiral rather than a straight line, presenting the same inter-advent struggle from different angles and with intensifying clarity. This is not imposed from outside but derives from internal markers, such as repeated climaxes of **judgment** and **victory** scattered through the book. Reading **Revelation 20** in this light resolves the tension between the defeat of the beast in **Revelation 19** and the subsequent mention of Satan’s binding; the visions are complementary, not sequential. His account of the **first resurrection** as either the believer’s translation to heavenly reign at death or the regenerative raising with Christ reflects older **Augustinian** and **Reformed** options and preserves the singularity of the final bodily resurrection at the **parousia**.

His exegesis refutes a **secret rapture**, instead affirming a public, cosmic arrival of the King that coincides with the **last trumpet** and the **new creation**. He underscores that the **mark of the beast** names idolatrous allegiance rather than microtechnology, and that tribulation is the church’s normal vocation. The payoff is an uncluttered horizon: one return, one resurrection of the just and unjust, one judgment, and one transfiguration of creation in the **new heavens and new earth**.

#### 7. Ecclesiology, sacraments, and the shape of hope
Because eschatology is inseparable from ecclesiology for Riddlebarger, he emphasizes the church as the locus of the **kingdom** in this age. The **means of grace** preaching and sacraments mediate the powers of the age to come. **Baptism** signifies union with Christ’s death and resurrection, tying the believer to the **first resurrection** reality now, while the **Lord’s Supper** is a pledge of the banquet to come. The pilgrim people are formed not by cultural conquest but by weekly ascents to Zion in **Lord’s Day** worship. This thick churchliness stands in critical tension with politically freighted eschatologies and supports a **two-kingdoms** or pilgrim ethic in which the common realm is honored under **providence** but not confused with the church’s redemptive mandate.

Theologically, this places Riddlebarger within a stream shaped by **Bavinck’s** organic neo-Calvinism yet chastened by **Vos** and **Kline** on the epochal boundary between the ages. The antithesis runs along the line of **regeneration**, not party; the victory belongs to the crucified **Messiah**, not to a program. Thus his amillennialism drives a spirituality of the church that is simultaneously catholic and confessional.

#### 8. Engagements, reception, and influence
Riddlebarger’s work has functioned as a gateway into **amillennialism** for a generation shaped by **Left Behind** and pop-apocalypticism. Seminaries and churches in the **URCNA**, **OPC**, and **PCA** assign **A Case for Amillennialism** for its compact synthesis of **biblical theology**, **confessional Reformed** commitments, and pastoral application. He debates **dispensational** writers by showing exegetical alternatives rather than caricatures, and he dialogues with **postmillennial** interlocutors by highlighting the New Testament’s pilgrim witness. His **Man of Sin** volume has provided an antidote to sensationalist treatments of **Antichrist**, returning discourse to the exegesis of **Paul**, **John**, and **Daniel**.

Critiques come from multiple directions. **Dispensational** scholars argue he flattens Israel’s national promises; **historic premillennialists** contend that the spiritualizing of **Revelation 20** misses the concrete victory of Christ in history; **postmillennialists** claim his posture risks ecclesial quietism. Yet even critics admit the clarity and sobriety of his approach, and some adopt his **recapitulation** model while retaining different millennial conclusions. His broader legacy includes a recovery of **catechetical preaching**, re-centering **law and gospel**, and guarding against triumphalist misreadings of this age.

#### 9. Doctrinal development and coherence
Across his writings, Riddlebarger demonstrates a principled coherence. **Christology** governs **eschatology**; **ecclesiology** mediates **kingdom** reality; **covenant theology** organizes the canon; **two-age eschatology** disciplines expectations. He appropriates **Augustine’s** two cities to distinguish ultimate and penultimate loyalties, follows **Vos** to map the unfolding of **redemptive history**, draws on **Hoekema** to explicate the already-not yet, and leans on **Kline** to resist the transposition of *intrusion* judgments into ordinary civil order. The **confessional** backdrop gives his proposals stability, even as he refines them through ongoing exegesis and pastoral practice.

Importantly, his project is not an idiosyncratic innovation but a retrieval of **classic Reformed amillennialism** in conversation with modern biblical theology. He displays awareness of the diversity within the Reformed tradition, admitting legitimate debate on the details of **Romans 11**, the referent of the **first resurrection**, and the scope of **Satan’s binding**, while insisting that the confessional center remains fixed: one return, one resurrection, one judgment, one renewed cosmos under **Christ’s** headship.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage point, Riddlebarger’s strengths are substantial. His **analogia fidei** method is classically orthodox; his **redemptive-historical** exegesis honors the unity of the canon; his ecclesial instincts prioritize **Word and sacrament**; and his critique of **dispensationalism** and **theonomy** aligns with **Westminster Standards** commitments to the spirituality of the church. Doctrinal tensions remain. First, the case for strict **recapitulation** in **Revelation** can feel programmatic unless buttressed by more granular literary analysis; some **Westminster** exegetes would press a thicker account of the book’s structure before drawing amillennial conclusions. Second, his reading of **Romans 11** balances hope and unity well, yet a **Westminster** alternative could more strongly affirm a future, large-scale conversion of Jews while safeguarding covenantal finality in **Christ**. Third, while his *already/not yet* frames the **two-kingdoms** posture with pastoral wisdom, **Kuyperian** heirs might argue for broader creational engagement under **common grace** without conflating the church’s mandate, and **historic premillennial** Reformed voices can maintain inaugurated eschatology while positing a future millennial victory as a legitimate option within confessional bounds. On balance, his work represents a careful, confessional **amillennialism** that resists both biblicist literalism and triumphalist historicism, offering Westminster churches a faithful, pastorally potent way to confess the **kingdom of Christ** between the times.
