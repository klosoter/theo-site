### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Jon Ruthven emerges as a late twentieth-century **Pentecostal/Charismatic** theologian whose lifework presses a single thesis: the **charismata** are divinely intended to continue as the church’s public authentication of the **gospel** in history. He writes when Pentecostal scholarship is consolidating its identity against entrenched **cessationism** in evangelical and Reformed circles, engaging the legacy of **B. B. Warfield’s Counterfeit Miracles** and the renewed polemic of **John MacArthur’s Strange Fire**. Within this ferment, Ruthven advances an integrative **biblical-theological** reading of **Luke-Acts**, deploys a **historical theology** of anti-miracle polemics, and frames a **missional** hermeneutic in which the church’s vocation is empowered by **Spirit baptism** for witness. His horizon is the **inaugurated kingdom** of **George Eldon Ladd**, the **pneumatological** emphases of **Gordon D. Fee** and **James D. G. Dunn**, and a global Pentecostal expansion where **signs and wonders** accompany evangelization.

Ruthven’s method is double-sided, combining canonical **exegesis** and diachronic **tradition-critique**. On the one side, he locates the theological center of the New Testament’s praxis in **Acts 1:8** and **1 Corinthians 12–14**, arguing that the distribution of **charismata** constitutes the concrete economy of the Spirit by which the church is built and the **mission** authenticated. On the other, he anatomizes **cessationism** as a contingent result of post-Augustinian developments, sharpened in Reformation and post-Reformation anti-Catholic polemics and hardened by Enlightenment **rationalism**. The epistemic stance is not credulity but **discernment of spirits** (*diakrisis pneumaton*), with criteria of **edification**, **love**, and **Christological confession**. Theologically, he treats **experience** not as a norming norm, but as a Spirit-occasioned witness that Scripture expects and regulates, a position calibrated against both **skepticism** and **enthusiasm**.

#### 2. On the Cessation of the Charismata: reconstructing the polemic
Ruthven’s signature contribution, **On the Cessation of the Charismata** 1993 with a revised edition 2008, is at once a historiography of **postbiblical miracles** and a constructive plea for **continuationism**. He traces the genealogy of cessationist claims from **Augustine’s** early hesitancies through his later miracle openness, through medieval disputes, into Reformation fears about ongoing **revelation**, and then to **Warfield’s** 1918 argument that miracles were limited to the apostolic era as signs of canonical foundation. Ruthven charges that modern Protestantism especially in its **Reformed** instantiation inherited a double bind of **anti-Roman** polemic and **Enlightenment** epistemology, which together displaced biblical expectations for **charismata**. The book’s historical core is thus a theological diagnosis of how non-biblical pressures hardened into doctrinal closure regarding **signs and wonders**.

Exegetically, Ruthven foregrounds texts that frame the Spirit’s empowering as constitutive of the **church’s life** until the **parousia**. He reads **1 Corinthians 13:8–12** as a rejection of premature eschatology, arguing that the coming of the **teleion** the perfect is not the closing of the canon but the eschaton, so **prophecy** and **tongues** abide in the interim. He aligns **Ephesians 4** with **1 Corinthians 12–14** to show ministries and **charismata** persist for the maturing of the body until the full stature of Christ. Central is **Acts**, where the pattern of **Spirit baptism** for witness is universalized in **Acts 2**, **8**, **10**, and **19**. The vocabulary of power **dynamis**, signs **sēmeia**, and wonders **terata** is not window dressing but missional substance, by which the gospel is publicly authenticated among Jews and Gentiles. Under **Ladd’s** already-not-yet eschatology, Ruthven contends that the kingdom’s **present inbreaking** makes **charismata** ordinary for mission, though always under the apostolic rule of **love** and **order**.

#### 3. Mission as authentication and the shape of Spirit baptism
Ruthven’s positive theology concentrates on the **authentication of mission**. The Spirit is the **missio Dei** ad extra, constituting the people of God as a **prophetic community**. In his telling, the Great Commission of **Matthew 28** and the empowerment promise of **Acts 1:8** are inseparable; the gospel’s witness is attested by the triad of **word**, **deed**, and **sign**. The early church embodies this triad, where **proclamation** is cast with **charismatic** confirmation that signals the kingdom’s presence and calls to repentance. This framework collapses the false dichotomy between evangelism and **edification**, since **prophecy** and healing are both externally missional and internally formative.

On **Spirit baptism**, Ruthven defends a classically **Pentecostal** reading: the Spirit’s empowering for witness is a distinct, often subsequent, grace relative to conversion, grounded primarily in **Luke-Acts** rather than a Pauline ordo salutis. He grants **soteriological** reception of the Spirit at conversion in Paul yet maintains that Luke’s theological emphasis on power for mission delineates a real and repeatable pneumatic intensification. The theology here is **subsequence without separatism**. Charismata are not badges of spiritual class but instruments of service; the primary norm remains **love** and the confession that **Jesus is Lord**. This articulation positions Ruthven near **Gordon D. Fee** on the integrality of the Spirit, yet closer to **Howard Ervin** and **Roger Stronstad** on **Lukan normativity** and **empowerment**.

#### 4. Prophecy, discernment, and congregational order
Within congregational life, Ruthven emphasizes **prophecy** as paradigmatic of the **prophetic community**. He agrees with aspects of **Wayne Grudem’s** argument that New Testament prophecy is real yet non-canonical, fallible in form but anchored in the infallible **revelation** of God, distinguishable from **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi externum. For Ruthven, this distinction safeguards **sola Scriptura** while leaving room for **guidance**, **edification**, and missionary insight through the Spirit’s **charismata**. The Pauline tests of **edification**, **peace**, **order**, and the **lordship of Christ** function as regulative criteria. A robust practice of **discernment of spirits** avoids both **enthusiasm** and credulity, pushing communities to weigh prophecies, judge by fruit, and keep the **cross** at the center of pneumatic experiences.

Ruthven’s ecclesial vision resists both bureaucratic **clericalism** and unrestrained **individualism**. The gifts are distributed to the body for the common good, a pneumatological **diakonia**. He critiques spectacle-oriented ministries that detach **signs and wonders** from catechesis and character. At the same time, he challenges sacramental traditions for restricting **divine action** to ordained rites, urging a re-reading of **Acts** where house-churches, lay believers, and cross-cultural converts become vehicles of **dynamis**. Here his kinship with the **Third Wave** legacy of **John Wimber** appears, though Ruthven insists that charismata be tethered tightly to **Scripture’s** rule of faith and to the **mission** of Christ.

#### 5. Tradition under judgment: What’s Wrong with Protestant Theology?
In **What’s Wrong with Protestant Theology? Tradition vs. Biblical Emphasis** 2013, Ruthven widens his lens from cessationism to the larger habitus of **Protestant scholasticism**. He argues that a dominant focus on **forensic justification** as the material center subordinated **pneumatological empowerment** and the **kingdom**’s praxis to the periphery, thereby normalizing churches without **charismata**. Without denying **justification by faith**, he claims the New Testament’s center is the coming of the **Spirit** who forms a **missionary** community authenticated by **charismatic** operations. He contrasts a tradition-bound **systematics** that abstracts doctrines from the narrative of **Acts** with a **biblical theology** that sees the same Spirit authoring Scripture and mission.

The polemical edge sharpens in Ruthven’s response to **John MacArthur’s Strange Fire** 2013, where he contends that wholesale denunciations of the **Charismatic Movement** confound abuses with biblical norms. He insists that the answer to counterfeit is not prohibition but **biblical regulation**, invoking **1 Corinthians 14** and the **fruit of the Spirit** as tests. At points Ruthven sounds like **Craig Keener** on reconsidering **miracles** as historically plausible and biblically expected, arguing that Western skepticism often owes more to **Hume** than to **Hebrews**. The upshot is not experientialism but a call to recover the **missional telos** of doctrine, where **theology** serves the Spirit’s advance of the **gospel**.

#### 6. Exegetical architecture: Luke-Acts, Paul, and the eschatological horizon
Exegetically, Ruthven’s architecture relies on **Luke-Acts** as programmatic for ecclesial **normativity**. He reads **Pentecost** not as an unrepeatable inauguration only, but as the template of **Spirit baptism** empowering the whole church for witness across cultures, genders, and classes. The Samaritan reception in **Acts 8**, Cornelius in **Acts 10**, and the Ephesian disciples in **Acts 19** reinforce that the **Spirit** disrupts ethnic and ritual boundaries through **charismata**. He integrates Paul by aligning **1 Corinthians 12–14** with Acts, pressing that the apostolic regulation of **prophecy**, **tongues**, and **healing** presumes their prevalence, not their expiration. The famous text **1 Corinthians 13:8–12** is expounded with the **parousia** as the horizon of the **teleion**, thus retaining the interim necessity of **charismata**.

Under **inaugurated eschatology**, Ruthven argues that the powers of the age to come have intruded into the present. The logic is covenantal-eschatological rather than dispensational: the **New Covenant** is characterized by **Spirit outpouring** upon all flesh, echoing **Joel 2** and realized in **Acts 2**. The prophetic democratization of the people of God yields a **charismatic** ecclesiology. Substantively, this binds **mission**, **sanctification**, and **edification** within a pneumatological economy, avoiding the cannibalization of Christian life by one doctrinal locus such as **justification** detached from **sanctification** or **vocation**.

#### 7. Epistemology and discernment: beyond rationalism and enthusiasm
Ruthven’s epistemology navigates between **Enlightenment rationalism** and **pietist enthusiasm**. He critiques the former for foreclosing supernatural causality and narrowing **testimony** as evidence, borrowing lines consonant with **Keener** to show that modern global Christianity regularly attests **healing** and **deliverance** events with credible documentation. Against enthusiasm, he re-centers the **canon** as the Spirit’s norm and binds all pneumatic phenomena to **Christocentric** confession, ethical **fruit**, and congregational **order**. The church is summoned to practice **testing of spirits**, a communal discipline that recognizes both **deception** and divine **guidance**. In his schema, the Spirit’s **paraklesis** encouragement and **dynamis** power converge in forming holy witnesses whose ministries are accountable to **Scripture** and to the body.

This epistemic posture informs a practical theology: rather than treat **charismata** as optional, churches should recover them as integral means by which God both addresses the world and edifies the saints. Ruthven urges theological education to train in discernment, not merely in polemic; to cultivate prayer for **healing** and openness to **prophecy**, not merely to defend against error. This is no romanticization of gifts but a reassertion of biblical **normalcy** under the lordship of **Christ** and the wisdom of the **apostolic** pattern.

#### 8. Reception, dialogue, and ongoing debates
Ruthven’s work has been welcomed across **Pentecostal** and **Charismatic** scholarship as a careful dismantling of inherited **cessationism** and as a constructive biblical case for **continuationism**. It stands alongside studies by **Roger Stronstad** and **Robert Menzies** on **Lukan pneumatology**, as well as in conversation with **Gordon D. Fee** on the Spirit’s ecclesial centrality. With **Wayne Grudem**, Ruthven shares the conviction that **prophecy** in the church is real but non-canonical, and with **Craig Keener**, he shares a historical rebuttal to **skeptical** canons of evidence. At the same time, he has elicited sharp critique from **Richard B. Gaffin**, who frames **miracles** as redemptive-historically bound to the apostolic foundation, and from **John MacArthur**, who treats the modern **Charismatic Movement** as theologically corrosive. These debates have clarified lines regarding **revelation**, **canon**, **ecclesiology**, and the **means of grace**.

Within Pentecostal circles, Ruthven’s insistence on **biblical regulation** of **charismata** has also served as an internal corrective, resisting market-driven sensationalism and urging the centrality of **love** and **holiness**. His message resonates in the **Global South**, where the growth of Christianity is frequently bound up with **healing** ministries and power encounter, providing theological ballast and **Scriptural** grounding for practices that might otherwise drift from orthodoxy. The continuing conversation revolves around how to maintain **Scripture’s sufficiency** while embracing **pneumatic** vitality, a balance Ruthven believes the New Testament itself models.

#### 9. Consolidated themes: Scripture, Spirit, and the church’s vocation
Across his corpus, Ruthven returns to three intertwined themes: the **sufficiency of Scripture** rightly understood as norming the church’s life, the **presence of the Spirit** as the New Covenant’s hallmark, and the **mission** of the church as the arena where doctrine proves its truth. He calls for a re-centering of **Acts** within **systematic theology**, not to displace **Paul**, but to correct a Western over-systematization that marginalizes **charismata**. He wagers that when the church embraces **Spirit baptism** as empowerment, cultivates **prophecy** under apostolic rules, and expects **signs and wonders** as kingdom tokens, it fulfills the biblical portrait of the **people of God**. The point is not pneumatic maximalism but **Christocentric** faithfulness sustained by the **Spirit** who both inspired **Scripture** and now indwells the church.

Ruthven’s proposals are thus as much ecclesial as academic. He speaks to pastors and missionaries who seek to wed **doctrinal orthodoxy** with **missional efficacy**. By reconstructing the history of **cessationism** and rehabilitating **continuationism**, he offers a theological rationale for practices that many Christians outside the West already take as biblical normal. His emphasis bridges academy and field, showing that careful **exegesis**, sober **discernment**, and bold **prayer** belong together in a church that confesses the **kingdom** is at hand.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: points of tension and possible paths
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Ruthven’s strengths include his **biblical-theological** emphasis, his insistence on the **canon’s normativity**, and his alertness to **Enlightenment** distortions in modern theology. Yet substantive tensions remain. First, his extension of **apostolic signs** into the entire church age challenges the Reformed **redemptive-historical** argument that extraordinary gifts served the once-for-all foundational era of **revelation**. The Reformed worry that Ruthven’s non-canonical **prophecy** blurs the **sufficiency of Scripture** as confessed in **Westminster Confession 1.1**, wherein God’s former ways of revealing His will are now ceased. Second, his **Lukan normativity** is questioned by a covenantal reading that privileges the didactic clarity of **epistles** to interpret **narrative**, not vice versa. Third, his center of gravity in **mission-authentication** risks subordinating **ordinary means of grace** Word, sacraments, prayer to extraordinary phenomena, whereas Reformed piety locates the church’s identity principally in the ministry of the **Word** and **sacraments** within the **covenant of grace**. A sympathetic but firm alternative would affirm the **already-not-yet** kingdom while distinguishing the unique, unrepeatable role of the **apostolate**; embrace the Spirit’s ongoing work in **illumination**, **sanctification**, and **providence**; and pursue pastoral openness to God’s freedom to heal and guide, all while maintaining that the rule of faith is the **canon** and the church’s vitality is ordinarily mediated by **preaching**, **baptism**, the **Lord’s Supper**, and disciplined **prayer**.
