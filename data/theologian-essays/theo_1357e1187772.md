### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Daniel Strange emerges as a contemporary **evangelical theologian** whose work is calibrated to late modern **pluralism** and post-Christendom Western conditions while engaging a global church wrestling with **religions**. Situated within British evangelicalism and long associated with **Oak Hill College** in London and later with **Crosslands** initiatives in theological formation, he draws on **Kuyperian neo-Calvinism** and **Van Tilian presuppositionalism** to forge a constructive **theology of religions**. The historical horizon for his project is the twentieth-century rise of **religious studies**, the missionary ferment following **Edinburgh 1910**, and the theological realignments around **pluralism**, **inclusivism**, and **exclusivism** marked by figures as diverse as **John Hick**, **Karl Rahner**, and **Hendrik Kraemer**. In this setting Strange adopts a distinctively **covenantal-apologetic** method that insists on **special revelation** as normative, underscores the **noetic effects of sin**, and yet preserves **common grace** as the condition for meaningful contact with the religious other.

At the level of first principles, Strange appropriates **Cornelius Van Til** on **antithesis** and **borrowed capital** while turning to **Herman Bavinck** and **J. H. Bavinck** for a richer theological psychology of the **sensus divinitatis** and **sensus religionis**. The **ethical** rather than merely **intellectual** character of human unbelief in **Romans 1** becomes programmatic: religions are not neutral data but moral-spiritual responses to revelation that involve an **idolatrous exchange** of the Creator for the creature. Yet Strange rejects quietist separatism by deploying **common grace** as the rationale for engagement, persuasion, and cultural participation. His approach is thus dialectical in a Reformed sense, resting on the **analogia fidei** rather than any **analogia entis**, while attending to the economic outworking of God’s **missio** in redemptive history.

Strange’s public profile advances a deliberately **biblical-theological** method that refuses to isolate the theology of religions from **canonical exegesis**. Reading the drama from **creation** through **Babel**, **Israel**, **exile**, and **Pentecost**, he situates the nations within the **Abrahamic promise** and the **Davidic** and **new covenant** horizons, culminating in the **eschatological** ingathering of the nations in **Revelation 21–22**. This canonical sweep frames the question of religious plurality not as a set of purely philosophical puzzles but as a **redemptive-historical** problem of **idolatry**, **demonic agency**, and **gospel proclamation**. To help contemporary audiences imagine Christian plausibility, Strange enlists **Peter Berger’s** notion of **plausibility structures** and **Charles Taylor’s** account of the **social imaginary**, rendering apologetics as formative ecclesial practice rather than as mere debate.

#### 2. The unevangelized and the logic of exclusivism
Strange’s early monograph, **The Possibility of Salvation Among the Unevangelized** 2004, engages the late twentieth-century debate over **restrictivism**, **inclusivism**, and **pluralism**. He tests **Rahner’s** theory of the **anonymous Christian**, **Pinnock’s** pneumatological **inclusivism**, and **Hick’s** **pluralism**, as well as evangelical **wider-hope** proposals, against a canonical matrix indexed by **Acts 4.12** and **John 14.6**. The conclusion is a nuanced **Christological exclusivism**: salvation is by **Christ alone**, appropriated through **faith** in response to **special revelation**, ordinarily mediated by **gospel proclamation** and **scripture**. Strange resists ad hoc appeals to **postmortem evangelization** or speculative accounts of **general revelation** that would secure salvation apart from the **Word**. He does not deny God’s **absolute sovereignty** to save extraordinarily, yet he insists that the economy disclosed by scripture binds the church to mission rather than to conjecture.

The polemical edge of Strange’s case is sharpened by **Romans 1–3** and the **idolatrous exchange** motif. General revelation reveals God truly yet not savingly; it renders the nations **without excuse** while also underwriting a persistent though distorted **sensus divinitatis**. For Strange, this duality between **cognition** and **suppression** is decisive for adjudicating **inclusivist** claims. Where much inclusivist writing treats non-Christian religions as diverse though legitimate **vehicles** of saving faith, Strange argues they are **systems** organized around the suppression of known truth. In his judgment, such systems cannot be saving media precisely because they are covenantally disobedient. This **covenantal** framing is the foundation for his later articulation of **subversive fulfillment**, which seeks to honor creational longing while denying salvific efficacy to rival faiths.

#### 3. Their Rock Is Not Like Our Rock: a theology of religions
Strange’s signature book, **Their Rock Is Not Like Our Rock** 2014 UK 2015 US, formalizes his **theology of religions** around a set of interlocking theses. First, the Bible’s narrative unites a positive doctrine of **general revelation** with a negative doctrine of **idolatry** and **demonic** distortion. The nations encounter God’s **glory** in creation and providence, but they exchange that glory for a lie, culminating in manufactured **gods** that are non-gods. Yet Israel’s story and the mission of the **church** show that these nations are not abandoned. Second, drawing on **J. H. Bavinck**, Strange asserts that every religion contains **magnetic points** or existential poles that witness to the imago Dei: questions of **totality**, **norm**, **deliverance**, **destiny**, and **transcendence**. These impulses are not salvific, but they furnish points of **contact** by which the gospel can both affirm and confront.

The centerpiece is Strange’s constructive principle of **subversive fulfillment**. Against the classic **fulfillment** hypothesis, which tends to baptize the aspirations of the religions, and against **replacement** models that lack missional empathy, Strange argues that Christ both fulfills and subverts. He fulfills in that he is the telos of the nations’ creational longings, answering the **magnetic points** with **gospel** realities. He subverts in that the path to fulfillment runs through **repentance**, **judgment on idols**, and the reconstitution of desire in union with **Christ** and communion with his **church**. The rhetorical fruit of this thesis is a method of evangelistic engagement: show how the rival **rock** is not like our **Rock**, demonstrating the inadequacy of the religious system to satisfy its own deepest questions, while announcing the crucified and risen **Lord** who alone provides **redemption** and **new creation**.

A further distinctive is Strange’s integration of **demonology** with the sociology of religion. He reads **1 Corinthians 10** and **Deuteronomy 32** as warrant for treating some religious phenomena as energized by **demons** without collapsing all religious artifacts into demonic causality. The conceptual balance is mediated by **common grace**. Because God restrains sin and grants gifts across humanity, religious cultures may display genuine though fragmentary **wisdom**, **beauty**, and **justice**. Yet the ethical core of these systems remains **idolatrous**, so that mission proceeds not as neutral dialogue but as **persuasion** with prayerful awareness of **spiritual warfare**. In this way Strange refuses both rationalist apologetics that neglect the **principalities** and romantic phenomenology that neglects **sin**.

#### 4. From theology of religions to cultural apologetics
Strange develops these convictions into broader cultural apologetics in **Plugged In** 2019 and **Making Faith Magnetic** 2021. The former treats popular **culture** as religion **externalized** in the Kuyperian sense, where **worldviews** become visible in films, novels, music, and digital media. The task of Christians, he argues, is **discernment** that distinguishes **structure** from **direction**: identifying creational structures that reflect God’s good order, while diagnosing the idolatrous direction that bends those structures toward false liturgies. He plays here with **Augustinian** themes of **ordered love**, translating them into practical tests for families and churches seeking to live as a missional **plausibility structure** within late modernity.

In **Making Faith Magnetic**, Strange offers a popularized account of **J. H. Bavinck’s magnetic points**. Each point is treated as an analytic of the heart that seeks a **comprehensive story** of the world, a **moral measure** for the self, a **rescue** from guilt and fear, a **future hope**, and a **connection** to what is beyond. Rather than using these as generic natural-theology proofs, Strange uses them narratively, showing how people already live inside borrowed **gospel echoes**. Christian witness then proceeds in two moves that mirror **subversive fulfillment**: expose how the culture’s answers collapse into **idolatry** or nihilism, and then commend how Jesus Christ answers the question not by supply of information but by forming a people whose **liturgy**, **catechesis**, and **table fellowship** embody a rival city. The church, in this telling, is not an afterthought to apologetics but the embodied **evidence** of the gospel’s **power**.

Strange correlates this with social theory by receiving **Peter Berger** on **plausibility structures** and **Charles Taylor** on the **immanent frame**. Churches, he argues, must be thick communities that sustain a Christian **social imaginary**, thereby enabling the faithful to resist cultural **deformation** and offering seekers a visible **counter-narrative**. This move reshapes apologetics from the stage to the parish, as the congregation’s public ethic of **mercy**, its **catechetical** patterned speech, and its sacrificial **holiness** render the claims of **atonement**, **justification**, and **sanctification** plausible. Theologically, this reenforces Strange’s confidence in **special revelation** and the priority of ecclesial practice as the Spirit’s ordinary means.

#### 5. Interlocutors and argumentative texture
Throughout, Strange prosecutes extended engagements with **pluralism**, **inclusivism**, and **fulfillment** theories. Against **John Hick**, he maintains that the center of salvation history is irreducibly **Christocentric**, not **theocentric**, and that any Kantian restriction of knowledge of the **noumenal Real** collapses the **incarnation** into moral parable. Against **Karl Rahner**, he argues that the **anonymous Christian** posits a soteriological **grace** untethered from **word** and **sacrament**, eroding the necessity of **mission** and the integrity of **faith**. Against **Clark Pinnock** and broader **wider-hope** schemes, he questions the exegetical warrant for postmortem evangelization and presses the logic of **Romans 10** that hearing comes through **preaching**.

Strange’s more sympathetic interlocutors include **Hendrik Kraemer**, **J. H. Bavinck**, and **Lesslie Newbigin**. From **Kraemer**, he absorbs the stress on the **uniqueness** of revelation in Christ and the **missionary encounter** as a summons to decision. From **J. H. Bavinck**, he borrows both the **magnetic points** and the notion of **possessio**, a concept he reformulates as **subversive fulfillment**. From **Newbigin**, he takes the conviction that the **gospel** is a public **truth**, though he is more guarded than Newbigin about the theological freight of **missio Dei** and the use of **natural theology** in pluralist contexts. Across these interlocutions, Strange’s hallmark is to keep **Romans 1** and **Acts 17** in view: the former to diagnose **idolatry**, the latter to frame **persuasion** that can cite the poets yet command repentance.

#### 6. Anthropology, demonology, and the nations
A distinguishing feature of Strange’s work is its integrated **anthropology**. Humans are **imago Dei** with an ineradicable **sensus divinitatis**, yet under **Adam** they are ethically bent. This anthropology explains both the ubiquity of **religion** and its structural **idolatry**. The gods are not merely cultural artifacts; they are **spiritual powers** that hold people in fear of **death**, guilt, and fate. Strange insists that missionary encounter must therefore be both **intellectual** and **liturgical**, both **rational** and **exorcistic** in the modest sense of renunciation, baptismal identity, and allegiance to Christ’s **lordship**. His appropriation of **1 Corinthians 8–10** and **Revelation** yields a sober account of **sacrifice** and **ritual** in the nations as sites of contested loyalty.

Within this frame, **common grace** functions as more than a restraining doctrine. It is the divine generosity that allows for relative **justice**, **art**, and **science** outside the church, and it grounds a qualified appreciation for non-Christian **virtues** while denying any exculpatory status to them. Strange uses **common grace** to justify entering the cultural worlds of the nations and also to explain why **subversive fulfillment** can find real though broken **signs** of longing. This doctrinal move protects his antithesis from absolutizing dualism and his engagement from indifferentism. It also anchors his concern for **ecclesiology**. The church is the covenant community where **special revelation** is read, sung, and enacted, and thus where the epistemic and ethical healing of the **noetic** and affective life is undertaken by the **Spirit**.

#### 7. Scripture, canon, and redemptive history
Strange’s commitment to **biblical theology** is not merely a matter of tone. His argument depends on the **canon**’s redemptive structure. **Genesis 1–11** frames the plurality of cultures as both part of God’s providential ordering after **Babel** and as the field in which **Abrahamic** promise will bless the nations. **Exodus** and **Deuteronomy** set the agenda by exposing the **nothingness** of idols and the covenant Lord’s jealousy. The **wisdom** literature registers the capacity for Gentile **wisdom** while narrowing it under the fear of the Lord. **Isaiah** and the **Psalms** anticipate the nations streaming to Zion, a motif transformed by **Pentecost** into multilingual testimony. **Acts 17** becomes exemplary for Strange: Paul’s engagement with **Athenian** religiosity models the use of the culture’s own **poets** for **subversive fulfillment**, culminating in a call to **repentance** because of the appointed **Judge**. Finally, **Revelation 21–22** secures the vision that the kings bring their **glory** into the city while nothing unclean enters, a polarity that seals his simultaneous affirmation of transformed cultural goods and total rejection of **idolatry**.

This canonical tapestry provides Strange with criteria for evaluating **theories of religion**. Where academic religious studies pursue **phenomenological reduction**, the canon insists on **covenantal evaluation**. Where missiology is tempted to pragmatic **contextualization** without theological ballast, the canon provides the grammar of **creation**, **fall**, **redemption**, and **consummation**. For Strange, therefore, theologies of religion must be tested not by comparative taxonomies but by **doctrine**, including **Christology**, **pneumatology**, **anthropology**, and **ecclesiology**. The result is an approach that stays recognizably **Reformed** while speaking fluently to the missional concerns of a post-Christendom era.

#### 8. Church, catechesis, and public witness
Because **apologetics** is ecclesial for Strange, he emphasizes the **church** as both **agent** and **arena** of persuasion. The congregation’s catechetical rhythm forms minds and affections in **orthodoxy** and **orthopraxy** that answer rival liturgies. This is why **Plugged In** asks believers to interrogate their habits in consumption of **media**, and why **Making Faith Magnetic** equips members to converse at the level of heart **questions**. He urges leaders to craft communities that are robust **plausibility structures**, where **hospitality**, **discipline**, and **mercy** make the gospel’s claims thick. In public, Strange’s Kuyperian instincts surface: Christians should labor for **institutional** and **cultural** goods as acts of neighbor love, while refusing both **sectarian withdrawal** and **civil religion**. The regulative center remains **word** and **sacrament**, from which all public action flows.

A particular outworking is Strange’s critique of naive syncretism in certain **insider movements** and his caution regarding an unmoored **missio Dei** that marginalizes the church’s **commission**. He prefers to speak of the **Triune God’s economy** realized in and through a visible, disciplined **people** who announce **repentance** and **forgiveness** in the name of **Jesus**. The church’s mission thus includes rational **argument**, prophetic **confrontation** of idols, and patient **formation** that over time renders Christianity not merely true but livable and desirable within contested **public space**. In this register Strange’s work is not only theological but pastoral, aimed at equipping ordinary saints to live wisely as a minority.

#### 9. Significance and Reformed evaluation
Daniel Strange’s contribution is to give **evangelical Reformed** theology of religions a durable grammar: **subversive fulfillment** as a constructive outworking of **antithesis** and **common grace** within a **biblical-theological** frame, and **plausibility structures** as the ecclesial strategy for persuasion. His proposals are lucid toward **pluralism** and **inclusivism**, offer concrete **missional** practices, and retrieve **J. H. Bavinck** for the contemporary church. The durability arises from his integration of **Romans 1**, **Acts 17**, and **Revelation 21–22**, his attention to **demonic agency**, and his refusal to outsource theology of religions to religious studies. Consequently he has become a reference point in evangelical circles tasked with forming Christians for life in late modern **secularity** and for global mission among the **nations**.

Reformed and Westminster-type evaluation honors Strange’s allegiance to **scripture**, **Christological exclusivism**, and a **covenantal** account of **idolatry**, yet presses several tensions. First, his suspicion of **natural theology** tracks **Van Til**, but some in classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would argue for a more positive appropriation of **natural law** under **general revelation** without conceding salvific power. The alternative would tighten Strange’s sociopolitical ethics while preserving his anti-idolatry stance. Second, his **Kuyperian** public theology rightly commends cultural labor, though **two-kingdoms** advocates will urge sharper distinction between the church’s **spiritual** mission and the common realm to forestall instrumentalizing the church as a **plausibility structure** for public ends. Third, the account of **demonology** is biblically serious but requires pastoral prudence to avoid reductive explanations of complex religious phenomena; the **principalities** must be named without flattening the mediating roles of **culture**, **institution**, and **habit**. Finally, his absolutizing of ordinary gospel **mediation** may appear to some too restrictive regarding extraordinary divine **mercy**; yet within **Reformed confessional** boundaries a chastened agnosticism about God’s secret work can sit alongside a robust insistence on **proclamation** as the revealed path. On balance, Strange’s project enhances the Reformed tradition’s resources for engaging **religions**, recruiting **antithesis**, **common grace**, and **ecclesiology** into a coherent missional theology whose enduring strength is to commend **Christ** as the only **Rock** in a world full of rival rocks.
