### TITLE
Mark A. Garcia as a contemporary Reformed voice who retrieves union with Christ and the duplex gratia as the architectonic center of salvation while insisting that confessional, catholic, and eschatological concerns belong together.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Mark A. Garcia** emerges in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century Reformed world, especially in Anglo-American and continental circles shaped by **confessional Presbyterian** and **post-Barthian** debates.
- Working in the wake of the **New Perspective on Paul** and the **Federal Vision** controversies, Garcia engages **historical theology** and **Pauline studies** from within robust **Reformed orthodoxy**.

- Methodologically, Garcia operates as a **historical theologian** whose constructive work arises from careful exegesis of **Calvin**, **union with Christ**, and the **duplex gratia** rather than from a freestanding system.
- He self-consciously locates himself within the **confessional Reformed** and **catholic** tradition, using close reading of primary texts as his main tool rather than speculative **philosophical theology**.
- Garcia treats **Scripture**, the **church’s tradition**, and redemptive-historical **eschatology** as mutually interpreting sources, often echoing **Vosian** and **Van Tilian** emphases.

- In **Life in Christ: Union with Christ and Twofold Grace in Calvin’s Theology** 2008, Garcia argues that **union with Christ** and the **twofold grace** of justification and sanctification form the structural core of **Calvin’s soteriology**.
- In his work on **Calvin’s eschatology** and edited volumes like **Resurrection Life in a World of Suffering** 2013, Garcia highlights the **eschatological** shape of Christian existence and **Christology**.
- Through essays and lectures tied to the **Greystone Theological Institute**, he advances a vision of **Reformed catholicity**, urging a retrieval of **patristic** and **scholastic** resources within a confessionally anchored framework.
- In various articles on **Paul**, **justification**, and the **New Perspective**, Garcia contends that classic **Reformed exegesis** better accounts for Pauline texts on law, faith, and union than **N. T. Wright’s** proposals.

- Garcia is most significant for the loci of **soteriology** union with Christ, justification, sanctification, and **ecclesiology**, especially as life in the body of Christ.
- He also contributes to **Christology** and **eschatology**, stressing that participation in the risen **Christ** by the Spirit is the comprehensive frame for Christian doctrine and piety.
- His insistence on **Reformed catholicity** touches **Scripture and tradition**, as he argues that a truly confessional Reformed identity will be deeply engaged with **patristic** and **medieval** sources.

- From a **Reformed exam angle**, you should present Garcia as a strongly confessional, **Westminster-friendly** theologian whose retrieval of **union with Christ** strengthens classical soteriology rather than undermining it.
- You should also be ready to show how his emphasis on **catholicity** and **eschatology** complements, rather than replaces, the forensic clarity of **justification by faith alone**.

- For comparison, set Garcia’s view of **union with Christ** and justification in conversation with **Calvin vs Trent** and with **Calvin vs the New Perspective on Paul**.
- On theology of retrieval and catholicity, compare **Garcia vs Hauerwas** on church and culture, and **Garcia vs Barth** on the relation of **Scripture** and ecclesial tradition.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Mark A. Garcia is a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose work unfolds within the late twentieth and early twenty-first century landscape marked by the **New Perspective on Paul**, the **Federal Vision** debate, and the contested legacy of **Calvin**. Trained in both North American and European contexts, and involved in institutions like **Greystone Theological Institute**, Garcia inhabits a space where confessional **Presbyterianism**, academic biblical studies, and ressourcement **historical theology** intersect. Theologically he stands downstream from **Vos** and **Ridderbos** on redemptive history, from **Bavinck** on organic Reformed dogmatics, and from **Van Til** on the antithesis between autonomous reason and submission to **revelation**. His biographical and institutional story is less crucial for exams than his setting: a Reformed world attempting to respond to **N. T. Wright**, to postmodern **ecclesial** fragmentation, and to a crisis of confidence in classical **forensic justification**.

The driving problem that animates Garcia’s work is how to retrieve **Calvin’s** doctrine of **union with Christ** and the **duplex gratia** in a way that secures both the forensic and transformative dimensions of salvation without collapsing one into the other. In **Life in Christ: Union with Christ and Twofold Grace in Calvin’s Theology** 2008, Garcia writes against readings of Calvin that either prioritize justification in isolation, as in some forms of ordo salutis **Reformed scholasticism**, or that dissolve justification into a broader participationist schema, as in some new **Lutheran** and **Catholic** interpretations. He is also answering the pastoral problem posed by the **Federal Vision**, where some invoked the language of union and covenant to blur the line between justification by faith alone and final justification on the basis of works. Garcia’s central concern is to show that **Calvinian** union-with-Christ theology, properly read, gives a richer and more stable account of **grace** that simultaneously honors confessional **forensic imputation** and robust **sanctification**.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically, Garcia is a **historical and exegetical** theologian who works from within explicit **confessional** commitments. His primary sources are **Scripture** read in light of the Reformed confessions, especially the **Westminster Standards**, and then the major figures of **Reformed orthodoxy** such as Calvin, **Bucer**, **Owen**, and **Bavinck**. In **Life in Christ**, Garcia proceeds by detailed textual analysis of **Calvin’s Institutes** and commentaries, asking how Calvin himself organizes his soteriology around **union with Christ** and the duplex gratia. He does not begin with an abstract system or philosophical account of **nature and grace**, but with the biblical economy as received and articulated in the Reformed tradition. His use of **reason** is ministerial and subordinate; he is not engaged in autonomous speculation but in clarifying what is already given in the canon and confessed by the **church**.

Garcia treats **revelation** as fundamentally textual and Christocentric, in line with classical Reformed **bibliology**. The Spirit speaks in and through **Holy Scripture**, and the church’s **tradition** has derivative authority as it rightly expounds that Word. At the same time, he is consciously catholic in his reading of **history**, arguing that Reformed theology must be in deep conversation with the **fathers** and the medieval **scholastics**. This is visible in his engagement with **Augustine** on grace and participation, and with **Aquinas** and later scholastics on the structure of the Christian life, yet always critically normed by Scripture and confession. There is thus a tension, though not a contradiction, between his robust appreciation of the broader catholic tradition and a Van Til flavored insistence that no allegedly neutral **philosophical** standpoint can sit above the Word of God as judge.

Experience and ecclesial practice also play a role in Garcia’s method, though never as independent sources of **theology**. His interest in the lived shape of **union with Christ** leads him to attend to practices of preaching, sacrament, and discipline in the **church**. Through Greystone and similar settings he contends that the academy and the pulpit belong together, so that doctrinal work arises from and serves the **worshiping community**. Yet he resists experientialist or liberal moves, such as **Schleiermacher’s** reduction of doctrine to religious feeling, because for Garcia the shape of Christian experience is determined by the prior reality of Christ and the promises of **Scripture**. The classical Reformed method of theology as the disciplined exposition of God’s self revelation in Christ and the written Word thus frames his work, even as he pushes for a richer, more historically aware practice of that method.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
In the locus of **soteriology**, especially union with Christ and the duplex gratia, the confessional baseline is that believers are united to **Christ** by the Spirit and faith, and in that union receive both the imputed righteousness of **justification** and the renewing grace of **sanctification**, with justification resting entirely on the obedience and satisfaction of Christ alone, received by faith alone. In **Life in Christ** 2008, Garcia argues that for **Calvin** this union with Christ is not a loose metaphor but the structural principle of his entire soteriology, such that justification and sanctification are distinguishable yet inseparable benefits that flow from a single, prior **union**. Against readings that subordinate sanctification to justification in a way that threatens antinomianism, Garcia stresses Calvin’s language of a twofold grace, underlining that the same Christ who is our righteousness is also our sanctification. His main interlocutors include scholars influenced by the **New Perspective on Paul**, such as **N. T. Wright**, who tend to redescribe justification mainly in ecclesial or covenantal terms, and also some within the **Federal Vision** who used union and covenant to undermine the forensic clarity of imputation.

In conversation with these interlocutors, Garcia insists that Calvin’s **forensic justification** remains irreducible and definitive, yet is always located within the broader participatory reality of **Christocentric union**. He pushes back against any scheme that would make union with Christ a merely existential category or a way of sneaking works into the ground of **justification**. Instead, he shows how Calvin can speak of a strong participation in Christ by the Spirit without jeopardizing the external, alien righteousness that is legally counted to the believer. This is a retrieval of classic Reformed **ordo salutis** concerns, but reorganized around the historia salutis and the believer’s shared life with the crucified and risen **Lord**. In this way Garcia stands against both antinomian distortions and moralistic proposals that tie final acceptance to our own faithfulness.

A second locus where Garcia is significant is **Christology and eschatology**, especially the believer’s participation in the risen and ascended **Christ**. The confessional Reformed baseline, expressed in the **Chalcedonian** and Reformed symbols, holds that the incarnate Son is one person in two natures, that his mediatorial work is once for all, and that believers are joined to him by the Spirit and so share in his benefits, including the resurrection of the body and eternal life. In his essays and in volumes like **Resurrection Life in a World of Suffering** 2013, Garcia develops the theme that union with Christ is fundamentally union with the crucified and **resurrected** Lord, which therefore gives an eschatological shape to the entire Christian life. He engages interlocutors such as **Moltmann**, whose theology of hope and the crucified God emphasizes eschatology and suffering, yet often at the expense of classical doctrines of **impassibility** and satisfaction. Garcia appropriates the concern for suffering and hope but roots them in the once-for-all accomplishment of Christ and the already-not yet tension of **Reformed eschatology** as developed by Vos and **Ridderbos**.

Here Garcia’s constructive move is to align participationist language firmly with the historic work and present session of Christ, rather than with a diffuse immanentism. Believers live out their calling as those who are already raised with **Christ** yet still await the consummation, so that sanctification and suffering are interpreted within a robust eschatological framework. This sits comfortably with the Reformed confessions, which speak of our being seated with Christ in heavenly places, though Garcia accents the existential and pastoral implications more strongly than many older **dogmaticians**.

A third important locus for Garcia is **ecclesiology and catholicity**, the doctrine of the **church** in relation to tradition and culture. The confessional baseline is that the church is one, holy, catholic, and apostolic, the pillar and ground of the truth, yet always under the authority of **Scripture** and reformed according to the Word of God. Garcia’s work with **Greystone Theological Institute** and in various essays emphasizes that Reformed theology must understand itself as a species of broader Christian **catholicity**, not as a sectarian project. He advocates for retrieval of **patristic** and medieval sources and a renewed attention to the practices of the church across time, while maintaining the normative status of the Reformed confessions. His interlocutors here include both sectarian **fundamentalists**, who are suspicious of any appeal to catholic tradition, and also certain **ecumenical** theologians who would relativize confessional boundaries in the name of unity.

Garcia argues that a truly Reformed church will be seriously catholic, which means embracing the creeds and the communal wisdom of the ages, yet without collapsing Reformed distinctives regarding **grace**, **sacraments**, and worship. This stance places him in constructive continuity with figures like **Bavinck**, who described Reformed theology as the most catholic form of Protestantism. Garcia develops this by encouraging liturgical and doctrinal renewal that looks back to the fathers while holding fast to justification by faith alone and the sufficiency of Scripture. The potential pressure point here is how he balances deference to catholic tradition with the Reformed insistence that **Scripture alone** is the final norm, though his explicit method keeps him clearly on the confessional side.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Garcia consciously locates himself within the stream of classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, and many of his key moves can be read as retrieval and clarification rather than innovation. In emphasizing **union with Christ** and the duplex gratia as architectonic, he stands close to **Calvin** and shows that later scholastics like **Turretin** and **Owen** never abandoned this framework, even when they used a more analytical ordo salutis. His attention to the organic unity of salvation reflects **Bavinck’s** insistence that Reformed theology is a life system centered on Christ. His eschatological accent and his focus on the history of redemption echo **Vos**, while his submission of all theology to **Scripture** over against neutral reason aligns him with **Van Til**. Later Reformed writers sympathetic to his project receive Garcia as a helpful corrector to overly narrow forensic accounts of salvation that risk disconnecting **justification** from the lived life of holiness.

Yet there are points where a Westminster examiner must press. First, there is always the danger that talk of **union with Christ** as architectonic, if not carefully qualified, might be heard as relativizing the unique forensic role of **justification** as a declarative verdict grounded in Christ’s imputed righteousness. Garlanding union language without guarding the legal distinction of justification can sound too much like some **New Perspective** or **Federal Vision** formulations. Garcia himself explicitly denies these errors, but in an exam one must stress that his use of union aims to protect the inseparability, not the confusion, of justification and **sanctification**. Second, his strong advocacy of **catholicity** and retrieval of **patristic** and medieval voices could drift, in other hands, into a softening of Reformed distinctives regarding **sola Scriptura** and **sola fide**. Here it is important to underline that for Garcia, unlike for some contemporary ressourcement theologians, the Reformed confessions are not negotiable but are the proper catholic reading of Scripture.

There are also clear places where Reformed theologians can learn from Garcia. His careful reading of **Calvin** demonstrates how much more robust and textured classic Reformed soteriology is than some twentieth century presentations that flatten everything into a single moment of decision. He helps pastors and theologians see that the doctrine of **union with Christ** is not an optional extra but the framework within which justification, adoption, and sanctification make sense. Similarly, his emphasis on **eschatology** and participation in the risen Christ offers a corrective to both quietist piety and triumphalistic activism, grounding Christian life in the already-not yet of the Kingdom. Finally, his call to a confidence-building **Reformed catholicity** provides a way to engage the broader Christian tradition without surrendering confessional conviction.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, the safest opening line about Garcia is to say that **Mark A. Garcia** is a contemporary Reformed theologian best known for retrieving **Calvin’s doctrine of union with Christ and the duplex gratia** as the organizing center of salvation, in the service of a confessional and catholic Reformed identity. This immediately places him within the **Reformed** family, signals his historical focus, and foregrounds union with Christ as his main contribution. You can safely and repeatedly say that Garcia strengthens classic **justification by faith alone** precisely by situating it within the believer’s Spirit wrought union with **Christ**, and that he wants to hold together forensic imputation and real transformation without confusion. It is also safe to describe him as a champion of **Reformed catholicity**, in continuity with **Bavinck** and **Vos**, who presses for retrieval of the fathers and medievals under the norm of **Scripture** and the Reformed confessions.

Phrases that require care and qualification include any suggestion that Garcia teaches a **participationist** account of justification that diminishes its forensic character, or that he embraces the **New Perspective on Paul**. You must avoid speaking of union with Christ as if it were the ground of justification in a way that makes imputation merely a way of describing participation, which would sound like some **Roman Catholic** or **ecumenical** reinterpretations of Calvin. If you say that union is the architectonic principle in Calvin and Garcia, you should immediately add that within that union, **justification** retains its distinct, once for all, forensic nature, as the confessions insist. Additionally, be cautious about language that might imply a weakened **sola Scriptura**, such as calling tradition a second source of revelation; instead, say that Garcia gives a high account of **Scripture** as the only infallible rule, while honoring the church’s broader **catholic** witness as a subordinate authority.

Examiners may exploit misunderstandings students often have about Garcia. Some assume that any robust union-with-Christ language signals a drift toward **Federal Vision** sacramentalism or toward **N. T. Wright’s** covenantal emphasis on faithfulness as the badge of membership. Here you should be clear that Garcia explicitly contests both, insisting that union is through faith in Christ alone and that good works are fruits and evidences, not the ground, of God’s verdict. Others may think that his interest in catholicity makes him similar to more revisionist **postliberal** or **Radical Orthodox** voices; in response, underscore that Garcia’s catholicity is resolutely **confessional** and that he treats the **Westminster Standards** and kindred confessions as faithful expositions of biblical truth. If pressed, compare his stance favorably with **Bavinck’s** vision of a richly historical yet confessionally anchored Reformed theology, and stress that any retrieval he advocates is in service of, not an escape from, classic Reformed **orthodoxy**.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Mark A. Garcia should be received as an ally whose retrieval of **union with Christ** and the **duplex gratia** in Calvin offers a salutary deepening of our grasp of salvation as both forensic and transformative, and whose emphases on **eschatology** and Reformed **catholicity** enrich our engagement with Scripture and the church’s tradition, yet always under confessional authority. We should affirm his insistence that justification by faith alone and the imputed righteousness of **Christ** remain non negotiable, even as we locate them within the broader Spirit wrought union that also yields sanctification and glorification, and we should affirm his call for historically robust, patristically informed Reformed theology. We must deny and clearly distance ourselves from any use of union language that would blur the legal uniqueness of **justification**, any flirtation with **New Perspective** or Federal Vision tendencies that make covenant membership the decisive category rather than God’s forensic verdict, and any rhetoric of catholicity that might relativize the final normative authority of **Scripture** and the binding status of the Reformed confessions. If asked where we land, we can say that we stand with Garcia where he stands with **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and **Vos** in confessing that believers are united to the crucified and risen Christ by the Spirit and faith, and in that union receive a twofold grace of justification and sanctification, with justification as the once for all forensic declaration grounded solely in Christ’s righteousness imputed and received by faith alone, while we remain vigilant to guard that forensic center from any participatory or ecclesial formulations that would obscure or displace it.
