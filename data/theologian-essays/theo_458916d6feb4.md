### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and a methodological center
Born in 1960 and educated in the late Cold War era, **Christian Smith** matured intellectually as the American religious landscape wrestled with **secularization**, an **evangelical resurgence**, and a dawning culture of **therapeutic individualism**. Trained as a sociologist at **Harvard** and early appointed at **UNC-Chapel Hill** before moving in 2006 to **Notre Dame**, Smith developed a methodological posture situated between positivist social science and postmodern suspicion. His enduring thesis is that only a **critical realist** and **personalist** social ontology can do justice to the moral depth of human agency and the complex structures of religion. Influenced by **Roy Bhaskar** and **Margaret Archer**, and in dialogue with **Charles Taylor** and **Alasdair MacIntyre**, he rejects both **reductionist naturalism** and constructivist nominalism, aiming for a robust account of persons as embodied, relational, and teleological. This conceptual center grounds his analyses of **evangelicalism**, **youth religion**, **Scripture and authority**, and the **moral shape of human action**, positioning his work as a bridge between empirical data and normative claims about *telos* and **flourishing**.

Smith’s early evangelical background, later complemented by his 2012 reception into **Roman Catholicism**, supplies his research with both intimate familiarity and critical distance. The institutional context of **Notre Dame** fostered his turn to **personalism** and **natural law** inflected moral theory. Across his career, the throughlines are constant: a commitment to **anti-reductionism**, a defense of **stratified ontology** with **emergent powers**, and an insistence that religion cannot be explained without reference to **normative goods**. These anchors cohere in his signature blend of **sociological description** and **philosophical anthropology**, a method that resists the evacuation of moral language from the social sciences and orients empirical findings toward questions of **truth**, **authority**, and **practice**.

#### 2. Anti-reductionist theory: critical realism and personalist ontology
The theoretical heart of Smith’s project is found in **What Is a Person? (2010)** and **To Flourish or Destruct (2015)**, where he advances a **critical realist personalism**. Against the causal closure of **positivism** and the explanatory imperialism of **evolutionary reductionism**, Smith argues for a **stratified ontology** in which higher-level social and personal realities possess **emergent causal powers** irreducible to physics or biology. Drawing on **Archer’s** morphogenetic approach and **Bhaskar’s** realism, he defends persons as conscious, reflexive, evaluative, morally oriented, narratively constituted, and relationally embedded agents whose actions are guided by perceived **goods** and aims at **flourishing**. The person is not merely a node in a network or a bearer of habitus in the **Bourdieusian** sense; rather, persons possess **teleological capacities** that make normativity intrinsic to social explanation.

In this frame, religions are not epiphenomenal but are **culture-bearing traditions** that shape **practices**, **moral visions**, and **structures of motivation**. Smith’s critical realism sanctions causal claims about **beliefs**, **doctrines**, and **ecclesial forms** without reducing them to demographic or economic substrate. His method thus legitimates theological categories such as **creation**, **sin**, and **grace** as socially potent without collapsing them into **Durkheimian functionalism** or **Weberian ideal types**. The result is a platform on which meaningful dialogue between **theology** and **sociology** can proceed, as religious speech has real explanatory traction within a **realist** account of the world and the person.

#### 3. Evangelical subculture and the dynamics of public conflict
Smith’s first major synthesis, **American Evangelicalism: Embattled and Thriving (1998)**, challenged narratives of inevitable **religious decline** by showing how evangelicalism’s **subcultural identity** flourished through a sense of cultural opposition. Borrowing from and critiquing **Bourdieu’s** theory of **fields** and **capital**, he argued that evangelical vitality is maintained by boundary-marking institutions, **networks**, and **symbolic universes** that convert a perception of embattlement into internal cohesion and outward activism. The analysis showed that **evangelical theology**, including **biblicism**, **conversionism**, and **activism**, functions sociologically as an identity system that generates both resilience and constraint.

In **The Secular Revolution (2003)**, a collective volume he edited and framed, Smith contested the myth of **neutral secularization**, arguing that secularization in the United States consisted of deliberate elite projects that displaced religious authority from public institutions. By documenting organized efforts within academia, law, media, and education, he recast the debate away from determinist decline toward **contestation** and **institutional power**. These works positioned Smith as a major voice among interpreters like **Peter Berger**, **Robert Wuthnow**, and **James Davison Hunter**, though Smith’s **critical realist** commitments pressed beyond descriptive sociology to probe **normative** stakes in the structuring of public life.

#### 4. Youth religion and Moralistic Therapeutic Deism
The most widely cited phrase associated with Smith, **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism**, emerged from the **National Study of Youth and Religion** and was operationalized in **Soul Searching (2005)** and **Souls in Transition (2009)**, followed by the broader cultural diagnosis in **Lost in Transition (2011)**. **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism** names a widely diffused de facto creed among American adolescents: a distant **God** exists, wants people to be **nice**, the goal of life is **happiness** and **self-esteem**, **God** is invoked when needed for problem-solving, and good people go to **heaven**. Smith’s typology discloses how **therapeutic individualism**, **consumerism**, and **deism** infiltrate nominally Christian settings, producing shallow **catechesis** and attenuated **discipleship**.

Beyond naming, Smith offered a causal account: weak **intergenerational transmission**, family fragmentation, and institutional outsourcing of **moral formation** leave youth with a culturally dominant but theologically vacuous repertoire. The result is a sociological critique with theological import: where **means of grace**, **creedal instruction**, and **ecclesial practices** are thin, **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism** fills the void. The finding became a touchstone for pastors and educators wrestling with **catechetical failure** and the collapse of **thick religious identity** into **therapeutic minimalism**.

#### 5. Personhood, morality, and normativity in social explanation
Smith’s **What Is a Person? (2010)** elaborates seven constitutive capacities of personhood, arguing that moral evaluation is not extrinsic overlay but intrinsic to the explanation of human action. In **To Flourish or Destruct (2015)** he extends this into a normative argument: humans are oriented toward **goods** and can **destroy** their own flourishing through patterns of **self-contradiction** and **anti-love**. He critiques **Humean** and **utilitarian** accounts for evacuating intrinsic goods, and disputes **Foucaultian** suspicions that reduce morality to power. Instead, within a **critical realist** frame, he retrieves a **teleological** grammar resonant with **virtue ethics** and **natural law**, even as he remains attentive to the **structural** impediments that shape moral possibilities.

This personalist turn feeds back into his sociology of religion: religions are bearers of **thick moral communities** that cultivate or erode **virtues**, sustain **narrative identity**, and define **ends** worth pursuing. Smith thereby renders intelligible theological claims about **sanctification**, **virtue**, and **wisdom** as empirically consequential. His normative overtures blurred standard disciplinary lines, proposing that any adequate social science must traffic in claims about the **true and the good**, not only about **causes and correlations**.

#### 6. The Bible Made Impossible: biblicism and interpretive pluralism
In **The Bible Made Impossible (2011)**, Smith turned directly to the evangelical house. He does not dispute **Scripture’s authority** or **inspiration**, but argues that a dominant evangelical **biblicism** is untenable because of **pervasive interpretive pluralism** among sincere and competent readers. The empirical fact that evangelicals who affirm inerrancy arrive at contradictory doctrines, polities, and practices undermines claims that the Bible functions as a comprehensive, handbook-like **blueprint**. Smith catalogues biblicist assumptions such as **naked literalism**, **if the Bible says it, that settles it**, and the expectation of uniform propositional clarity across genres, then shows their descriptive failure across evangelical subtraditions.

As an alternative, Smith recommends a **Christocentric**, **kerygmatic** reading governed by the **Rule of Faith**, suggests a **prima Scriptura** posture in which **Scripture** is materially sufficient yet normed within a living **ecclesial tradition**, and commends canonical, typological, and narrative-hermeneutical practices that have historically guided the church. The book’s punchline is sociological yet theological: biblicism is not only **hermeneutically naive**, it is institutionally **unsustainable**. The argument, arriving on the eve of Smith’s 2012 conversion to **Roman Catholicism**, pressed evangelicals to face the gap between confessional claims about **perspicuity** and the lived reality of doctrinal fragmentation. It sparked debate among evangelicals and Catholics alike over **interpretation**, **authority**, and the place of **magisterium** versus **confession**.

#### 7. Religion’s nature, disbelief’s limits, and transmission
Smith’s later works broaden the frame. In **Religion: What It Is, How It Works, Why It Matters (2017)** he defines religion as a **complex of culturally prescribed practices**, **moral orders**, and **narrative symbol systems** oriented to perceived **supernatural** realities that reorder life toward **ultimate goods**. His realist definition resists both **reductionist functionalism** and vague spirituality. In **Atheist Overreach (2018)** he critiques the epistemic and moral overclaims of **new atheism**, arguing that secular moral consensus lacks sufficient **ontological grounding** within reductive naturalism. With **Amy Adamczyk**, **Handing Down the Faith (2021)** analyzes **religious parenting**, showing that parental modeling, **marital stability**, and integrated **congregational support** most predict durable religious transmission.

These works reinforce Smith’s earlier themes: religion is about **truth and goods**, not merely **belonging**; secular critiques often assume what they cannot justify; and long-term religious vitality depends on **thick practices**, not programmatic **youth ministries**. The normative undertow remains explicit: a society that neglects **moral formation** and **traditioned wisdom** produces the anthropologies that **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism** so starkly names.

#### 8. A distinctive contribution across disciplines
Smith is unusual in contemporary scholarship for fusing **empirical sociology**, **philosophical anthropology**, and **theological concern**. From **American Evangelicalism (1998)** to **The Bible Made Impossible (2011)** and **What Is a Person? (2010)**, he maps how **institutions**, **ideas**, and **persons** interact. He confronts **Durkheimian** functionalism, **Bourdieusian** reproduction, and **positivist** empiricism with a realist insistence on **truth**, **goodness**, and **agency**. His invention of **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism** gave pastors and educators a shared vocabulary for **catechetical crisis**, while his critique of **biblicism** forced evangelicals to re-examine **sola Scriptura** as a doctrinal principle rather than a naive **method of reading**. The later Catholic turn and attachment to **ecclesial tradition** align with his desire for interpretive authority that can withstand **pervasive pluralism**.

Throughout, Smith remains a sociologist of religion rather than a dogmatician. Yet his sustained engagement with **authority**, **anthropology**, and **moral order** makes him a consequential interlocutor for systematic theology. He should be carefully distinguished from the Reformed philosopher **James K. A. Smith**, even as both share interest in **practices** and **formation**. Christian Smith’s distinctive voice is that of a **critical realist** insisting that persons and their beliefs are causally real, that **traditions** embody substantive **goods**, and that without a teleological account of **flourishing**, social science loses its most important subject, the human person.

#### 9. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Smith’s **critical realist** defense of a stable creation order, **emergent personal capacities**, and robust **teleology** resonates with **Reformed realism** about the world’s intelligibility under **providence** and the **imago Dei**. His exposure of **Moralistic Therapeutic Deism** aligns with Reformed diagnoses of **catechetical anemia**, the neglect of **means of grace**, and the corrosions of **therapeutic culture**. His insistence that social explanation requires **normative goods** coheres with **natural law** retrievals within Protestant orthodoxy when subordinated to **special revelation**. The friction arises with **The Bible Made Impossible** and its inference from **pervasive interpretive pluralism** to the insufficiency of **sola Scriptura**. Reformed theology classically differentiates **sola Scriptura** as principial authority from **biblicism** as a flattening hermeneutic; the **Westminster Confession** affirms **perspicuity** in essentials and adjudication by **good and necessary consequence**, mediated ministerially through the **confessions** and the church’s **teaching office**, not through a **magisterial infallibility**. Pluralism is thus explained by the **noetic effects of sin**, the diversity of **secondary causes**, and the lack of confessional discipline, not by Scripture’s inadequacy. The constructive alternative is a **redemptive-historical**, **Christocentric** hermeneutic under **analogia fidei**, situated in confessional **catholicity**, where **Scripture** remains the only infallible rule and **tradition** serves ministerially. Smith’s person-centered teleology should be further Christologically specified under **union with Christ** and **covenant of grace**, lest **flourishing** drift toward generic eudaimonism. In sum, Reformed theology can appropriate Smith’s **critical realism**, his mapping of **youth religion**, and his critique of **biblicism**, while refusing the slide from sociological pluralism to **ecclesial infallibilism**, and while rooting moral realism in **creation and covenant** rather than in sociology’s own authority.
