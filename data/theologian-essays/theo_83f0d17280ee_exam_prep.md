### TITLE
Augustine is the indispensable architect of Western Christian theology whose profound doctrine of grace and the Trinity we must appropriate, while carefully correcting his lingering sacramentalism and ecclesiology in the light of Scripture.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Augustine** lived from 354 to 430 in late **Roman North Africa**, writing under the pressures of the **Donatist** schism and the **Pelagian** controversy during the fracturing of the Western Empire.
- Formed by **Neoplatonism** in **Milan** and then as bishop of **Hippo**, he stands at the hinge from the Greek **Patristic** world to the emerging **Latin** Middle Ages.
- His theological method is a Scriptural, churchly **lectio** shaped by rhetorical training and **Neoplatonic** categories, as seen in his *Confessiones* and *De doctrina Christiana*.
- He treats **revelation** as mediated through the **Scriptures** within the **church** yet also insists on the inner teaching of the **Spirit** who illumines the mind.
- He uses **reason** as a ministerial instrument that clarifies **faith** but never replaces the authority of the divine **Word**.
- In the *Confessiones* c. 397, **Augustine** narrates his restless search for God and articulates a profound **theology of desire** and divine **grace**.
- In *De Trinitate* c. 400–419, he presents a psychological **Trinitarian** model that shaped the entire Western doctrine of **God**.
- In *De civitate Dei* 413–426, he contrasts the **City of God** and the **earthly city**, grounding a Christian theology of **history** and **culture**.
- In the anti-Pelagian works like *De spiritu et littera* 412 and *De praedestinatione sanctorum* 428–9, he sets forth his mature doctrine of **original sin**, **grace**, and **predestination**.
- He is decisive for Western doctrines of **Trinity** and **Christology**, especially divine simplicity, the unity of the divine will, and Christ the Mediator.
- He is foundational for doctrines of **grace, sin, and predestination**, shaping later **Augustinian** and **Reformed** soteriology.
- He gives a dense account of **Scripture, church, and sacrament**, especially in the context of the **Donatist** and **Pelagian** controversies.
- For a Westminster exam, **Augustine** should be honored as the primary patristic source for **Reformed** theology of grace and the Trinity, yet distinguished from confessional positions on **sacraments** and **ecclesiology**.
- A Reformed candidate should show how **Calvin** and **Bavinck** critically receive Augustine, especially in doctrines of **predestination**, **illumination**, and **church**.
- Be ready to compare **Augustine vs Pelagius** on sin, grace, and free will as a template for later **semi-Pelagian** controversies.
- Be ready to compare **Augustine vs Aquinas** on nature and grace and **Augustine vs Calvin** on church, sacraments, and assurance.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**Augustine of Hippo** was born in 354 in **Thagaste** in Roman North Africa, educated in rhetoric in **Carthage**, and later taught in **Rome** and **Milan**, before his conversion in 386 under the preaching of **Ambrose**. He was shaped by three main currents: the Latin Christian tradition of **Tertullian** and **Cyprian**, the philosophical **Neoplatonism** of **Plotinus**, and the rhetorical culture of the late imperial aristocracy. After his baptism in 387, he returned to Africa, became presbyter in 391, and bishop of **Hippo Regius** in 395, serving there until his death in 430 during the **Vandal** siege. His life is framed by major controversies with **Manichaeans**, **Donatists**, and **Pelagians**, each forcing him to clarify doctrines of God, Christ, church, and grace.

The driving problem of **Augustines** theology is how the restless and fallen human person can come to enjoy the **triune God** in truth, given the reality of sin, the limits of reason, and the fragility of the visible **church** in history. Against **Manichaeism**, he labors to defend the goodness of creation and the sovereignty of the one simple **God**. Against the **Donatists**, he defends the catholic unity and mixed character of the church as a **corpus permixtum**, where the efficacy of sacrament depends on **Christ** rather than the ministers purity. Against **Pelagius** and the later **semi-Pelagians**, he wrestles with the bondage of the will, the depth of **original sin**, and the sheer gratuity of **grace** and **predestination**. Underneath these controversies runs a deeper metaphysical and spiritual question: how can a mutable, time-bound creature come to know and love the immutable **Trinity** in a world marked by historical decay and political collapse.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
**Augustines** method is anchored in **Scripture** read within the visible church, yet interpreted through a refined use of **reason** and the categories of **Neoplatonism**. In *De doctrina Christiana* begun c. 397, he describes theology as the art of interpreting the **Scriptures** so that we may come to love **God** and neighbor rightly. The churchs rule of faith, especially the **Trinitarian** and **Christological** creeds, guides exegesis, and disputed texts are read in light of the clearer ones. He allows multiple spiritual senses, yet insists they must cohere with the love of **God** and the **Catholic** rule. For Augustine, the canon is the uniquely authoritative norm; philosophy can supply tools, but the **Bible** constitutes the governing voice of **revelation**.

For **reason** and **experience**, Augustine articulates a classic faith seeking understanding model. In *Confessiones* and *De Trinitate*, he describes the soul ascending to **God** by way of inner reflection, tracing vestiges of the **Trinity** in memory, understanding, and will. This is not unaided natural theology in a Thomistic sense but rather a reason healed by **grace** and illuminated by the **Spirit**. In *De magistro*, he argues that the true Teacher is **Christ** who inwardly illuminates the mind, and in *De spiritu et littera* he emphasizes that the letter kills apart from the vivifying **Spirit**. Thus he speaks of an internal **illumination** whereby God causes us to see the truth of his own Word. The tension with later Reformed method is that, at times, his doctrine of illumination can be read as grounding knowledge of **God** in a somewhat immediate inner light, which, if abstracted from Scripture and covenant history, may seem to tilt toward an interiorized epistemology that **Van Tilian** thought would sharply qualify.

In relation to **church** and **history**, *De civitate Dei* shows Augustine treating history as the unfolding drama of two loves: the **City of God** which loves God to the contempt of self, and the earthly city which loves self to the contempt of God. History is therefore the arena in which God executes his eternal decrees, including **predestination** and reprobation, through the means of Word, sacrament, and providential rule. The visible **church** is the historical locus of the preaching of Scripture and the administration of sacraments, though its boundaries are not simply identical with the elect. For a Reformed reader, his heavy accent on visible catholic unity, his linkage of salvation with sacramental incorporation, and his lack of a fully developed formal sufficiency of Scripture introduce tensions with later **Reformation** emphases on *sola Scriptura* and a clearer visible invisible church distinction.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, on the **Trinity**, the confessional baseline is Nicene orthodoxy: one simple **God**, three distinct persons, *homoousios* in essence, distinguished by personal properties and relations of origin. In *De Trinitate* Augustine receives and deepens this Nicene faith. He insists on divine **simplicity**, that God is what he has and that all attributes are identical with the divine essence, and he strongly emphasizes the unity of the divine will and operation, a major influence on later **Western** theology. He introduces the psychological analogies of the Trinity, particularly the triad of memory, understanding, and will, as an image of Father, Son, and Spirit. While this is not offered as a proof of the Trinity but as an aid to contemplation, it shapes the Western focus on the **immanent** life of God. His polemical target is mainly **Arian** and **subordinationist** thought, yet his formulation of the **filioque**, the Spirit proceeding from the Father and the Son, becomes a key point of later East West tension. Reformed orthodoxy welcomes his strong doctrine of divine simplicity, inseparable operations, and the coequality of the three persons, while recognizing that his use of psychological models must be disciplined by the biblical pattern of **economy** and personal distinction.

Second, on **grace, sin, and predestination**, the confessional baseline is that fallen man is totally unable to will or do any spiritual good, that saving faith is a gift of sovereign **grace**, and that election is unconditional and particular. In his anti-Pelagian works like *De natura et gratia* 415, *De correptione et gratia* 426, and *De praedestinatione sanctorum* 428–9, Augustine moves toward this position with remarkable clarity. Against **Pelagius** and **Celestius**, he insists on the radical corruption of human nature through **original sin**, transmitted to all in Adam so that all are born guilty and bent away from God. He teaches that saving grace is not merely external help but an internal, efficacious gift that changes the heart and causes the will to delight in the good. He speaks of **predestination** as Gods eternal purpose to give this grace to some and not to others, grounding election in Gods mercy alone, not foreseen faith. Yet he does not develop a fully symmetrical reprobation doctrine and sometimes speaks in ways that later **Reformed** theology would nuance. Nonetheless, **Calvin** and **Bavinck** see here the fountainhead of their own soteriology, though they will refine his vocabulary of free will and clarify assurance and the ordo salutis.

Third, regarding **church, sacrament, and Scripture**, the baseline Reformed position is that the visible church is the community where the pure preaching of the **Word**, right administration of **sacraments**, and discipline mark the body of Christ, and that Scripture alone is the final norm of doctrine. In *Contra epistulam Parmeniani* and *De baptismo contra Donatistas*, Augustine argues against the **Donatists** that the church is a mixed body and that the validity of **baptism** depends on Christ and the divine promise rather than ministerial worthiness. He robustly locates salvation within the catholic church and treats the sacraments as signs that both signify and, when received rightly, confer grace. His famous statement in *Contra epistulam Manichaei* that he would not have believed the **Gospel** except moved by the authority of the **Catholic Church** underscores his high view of ecclesial authority. Nevertheless, he also stresses the normative role of canonical Scripture and does not grant the church authority to invent new doctrines beyond the deposit of faith. Reformed theology gratefully inherits his anti-Donatist ecclesiology and his focus on Christ as the true minister of sacraments, yet must qualify his view of baptismal regeneration and his occasional implication that sacramental participation is ordinarily necessary for salvation in a manner that can obscure justification by faith alone.

Fourth, concerning **culture, politics, and history**, the confessional baseline is that Christ is Lord over all kingdoms, that civil government is ordained by **God**, and that believers are citizens of heaven who still owe obedience to earthly authorities in all things lawful. In *De civitate Dei*, written in response to **pagan** charges that Christianity caused Romes fall, Augustine draws a penetrating distinction between the **City of God** and the earthly city. These are defined not by outward institutions but by ultimate loves and ends: one loves **God**, the other self. The two cities are intermixed in history until the final judgment, and no political order can ever be identified with the kingdom of God. Earthly peace is a provisional good that can be used by the pilgrim people of God to seek the heavenly peace of the **beatific vision**. Augustine thus supplies a theology of history that relativizes empire and prevents sacralization of the state. Later **Reformed** thought, including **Calvin** and **Vos**, develop these themes in their own two-kingdoms and redemptive-historical frameworks, even as they clarify the positive role of civil law and the ordinary goodness of created cultural tasks in ways that correct some residual Augustinian suspicion toward temporal goods.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical **Reformed** theologians repeatedly appeal to Augustine as their principal patristic ally, especially on grace and the Trinity. **Calvin** calls Augustine wholly ours on the doctrine of grace and constantly cites him on **original sin**, the bondage of the will, and the necessity of efficacious calling. **Turretin** and **Owen** also mine his anti-Pelagian writings as evidence that unconditional **election** and monergistic regeneration are not novelties of the Reformation but rooted in early **catholic** theology. **Bavinck** treats Augustine as one of the great architects of Christian thought and a key witness to classical **theism**, particularly divine simplicity and immutability, as expounded in *De Trinitate*. **Van Til** sees Augustine as an early expression of analogical thinking about **God** and the creator creature distinction, while also warning that his use of **Platonism** left cracks that later **scholasticism** widened. A Westminster examiner will, however, press at least two objections. First, Augustine does not clearly articulate *sola fide* and often folds justification and sanctification into a broad concept of **gratia** and renewal, especially in his sacramental and penitential language, which the Reformed confessions sharpen. Second, his high sacramental and ecclesial claims, including statements that appear to teach baptismal **regeneration** and extra ecclesiam nulla salus in a strong sense, require confessional correction. Nonetheless, Reformed theologians can learn from his God-centered **doxology**, his rigorous exposition of the **Trinity**, his deep analysis of the human heart in *Confessiones*, and his insistence that saving knowledge of God is a gift of **grace** that humbles human pride and comforts the believer amid the crumbling of earthly cities.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, safe opening sentences will present **Augustine** as the central Latin Father whose doctrine of grace and the Trinity undergirds much of later **Reformed** theology. One might say, Augustine of Hippo is the great architect of Western theology, and the Reformed tradition stands as his most consistent heir where he is most biblical. Another safe line is to stress that his anti-Pelagian teaching anticipates the Reformed doctrines of **total depravity**, **irresistible grace**, and unconditional **election**, while his *De Trinitate* gives a classic articulation of **Nicene** orthodoxy and divine simplicity. Phrases to avoid or qualify would include calling Augustine the father of **Roman Catholicism** in a simplistic way, or speaking of his doctrine of **baptism** as straightforwardly equivalent to Reformed covenant theology. One must also avoid unqualified claims that Augustine teaches a full doctrine of **justification by faith alone** in the later Protestant sense; examiners will want you to say instead that he provides elements which the Reformation clarifies and systematizes. Another landmine is to romanticize his use of **Neoplatonism** or his doctrine of inner illumination in a way that sounds like autonomous **mysticism**; you must keep stressing that for Augustine, Scripture and the incarnate **Christ** remain the norming revelation and that illumination is the Spirits work to make us receive the biblical Word. Examiners often exploit misunderstandings where students think Augustine is simply a philosopher of interiority or a quasi-dualist who despises the body; here you should emphasize his anti-Manichaean defense of the goodness of **creation**, his sacramental realism, and his affirmation of bodily **resurrection**. Likewise, some assume his two cities doctrine means withdrawal from culture; you should clarify that Augustine urges faithful, though penultimate, involvement in earthly callings under the lordship of **Christ**. The key is to speak of him as a complex yet deeply biblical theologian whose enduring influence must be sifted by the **Reformed** confessions.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Augustine is to be warmly affirmed as a foundational witness to classical **theism**, Nicene **Trinitarian** orthodoxy, and monergistic **grace**, especially in his anti-Pelagian insistence on original sin, the bondage of the will, and unconditional predestination, yet he must be corrected where his sacramental and ecclesiological formulations blur the doctrine of justification by faith alone, obscure the formal sufficiency of **Scripture**, or lean too heavily on philosophical **Platonism**. We deny as non-negotiable any reading of Augustine that would support Roman claims about the churchs infallible magisterium, baptismal regeneration as ordinarily effecting salvation ex opere operato, or a confusion of justification and sanctification within a single concept of infused **grace**. If asked where we land, we say that the Reformed confessions represent a thoroughly Augustinian doctrine of **God** and **grace**, purged and disciplined by the supreme authority of Scripture, so that we receive Augustine as a crucial father in the faith, not as a final norm but as a powerful ally when and where he most clearly echoes the Word of God.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Augustine of Hippo** is the central Latin Father whose doctrines of the **Trinity** and **grace** provide the deepest patristic roots of the Reformed tradition, though his sacramental and ecclesial views must be critically refined by Scripture.

- Born 354 in **Thagaste**, converted in **Milan** 386, bishop of **Hippo** from 395, died 430 during the **Vandal** siege.
- *Confessiones* c. 397 portrays Augustines conversion and develops a **theology of desire** and divine **grace**.
- *De Trinitate* c. 400–419 and *De civitate Dei* 413–426 articulate his mature **Trinitarian** theology and his doctrine of the **two cities**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:

- He treats **reason** as ministerial, healed by **grace**, and insists on inner **illumination** by the Spirit as the way we truly know God in Christ.
- He reads **history** through the lens of the **City of God** and the earthly city, seeing historical events as the arena of Gods sovereign purposes.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On the **Trinity**, Augustine affirms Nicene **homoousios**, divine **simplicity**, and inseparable operations, using psychological analogies in *De Trinitate*.
- On sin and **grace**, his anti-Pelagian writings teach deep **original sin**, the bondage of the will, and efficacious, unmerited **predestination**.
- On **church** and **sacraments**, he opposes **Donatism**, defends the mixed nature of the visible church, and grounds sacramental efficacy in **Christ**.

- On **culture** and **politics**, *De civitate Dei* distinguishes the **City of God** from the earthly city, relativizing all empires under Gods kingdom.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press that Augustine does not articulate **justification by faith alone** with the clarity of the Reformed **confessions**.
- His language on **baptismal regeneration** and strong extra ecclesiam emphasis must be qualified in light of Reformed **ecclesiology** and **soteriology**.
- His appeal to **church** authority in believing the Gospel raises questions about the formal sufficiency of **Scripture** emphasized in *sola Scriptura*.
- His use of **Neoplatonism** and psychological **Trinitarian** models must be subordinated to the biblical **economy** and creator creature distinction.

COMPARISON HANDLES:

- **Augustine vs Aquinas** compares an earlier, more Platonic view of **nature and grace** with a later, more Aristotelian synthesis.
- **Augustine vs Calvin** shows continuity in **predestination** and **grace** but sharper Reformed clarity on justification, sacraments, and **church** discipline.
- **Augustine vs Eastern Fathers** highlights Western emphasis on **divine simplicity**, **filioque**, and the inner life of God over Eastern focus on energies and deification.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- **Augustine** is the great Western doctor whose profoundly biblical doctrines of the **Trinity** and **grace** the Reformed tradition most faithfully extends, while correcting his sacramentalism and ecclesiology by the supreme authority of **Scripture**.
