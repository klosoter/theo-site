### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John S. Hammett emerges within the late twentieth and early twenty-first century **Southern Baptist** reconfiguration sometimes termed the conservative resurgence, teaching at **Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary** as that institution was repositioned toward orthodox confessional fidelity and missionary urgency in the 1990s and 2000s. His ecclesiology answers a palpable pastoral crisis of **membership inflation** and **discipline neglect** in American evangelicalism. Methodologically, Hammett weds a canonical, **biblico-theological method** to evangelical Baptist convictions about the sufficiency and perspicuity of **Scripture**, employing historical theology as a critical but subordinate conversation partner. The structure of his work presumes that doctrinal retrieval must be practice-forming, so that **regenerate church membership**, **believer's baptism**, and **elder-led congregationalism** are not antiquarian theses but pastoral imperatives. His prose displays careful exegesis of texts like **Matthew 16 and 18**, **Acts 2**, and **1 Corinthians 5**, a sensitivity to the moral shape of community, and an insistence that the church’s order serves the **Great Commission**.

Hammett’s intellectual instincts arise from the **believers church** tradition associated with historic Baptists and Anabaptists, but his temperament is catholic and dialogical, engaging **Reformed**, **Presbyterian**, and **free church** sources with a measured charity. He avoids speculative metaphysics, focuses on concrete ecclesial practices, and treats theological language such as **ordinance** rather than sacrament as materially doctrinal rather than merely semantic. His work is thus a hybrid of **systematic-biblical theology** and pastoral theology, seeking to recalibrate Baptist churches around the classic marks of Word rightly preached, ordinances rightly administered, and **discipline** faithfully exercised.

#### 2. Baptist identity retrieved and corrected
Historically Hammett reads the nineteenth and twentieth century **Baptist** story as a mixed legacy. He honors the doctrinal and institutional achievements of figures like **B. H. Carroll** and **J. L. Dagg**, whose Manual of Church Order offered a robust defense of **congregational polity** and **discipline**, while offering a gentle corrective to **E. Y. Mullins** whose emphasis on soul competency in the early twentieth century unintentionally seeded a thin ecclesiology and an individualistic anthropology. For Hammett, soul competency must be reconceived within the corporate structures of **covenant membership** and the **keys of the kingdom**. The populist pragmatism of late revivalism, which tolerated inflated rolls and facile decisionalism, is indicted as a pastoral failure that betrayed the **regenerate church membership** principle.

To repair this breach Hammett retrieves the believers church thesis that the local church is a **new covenant community** composed, so far as human judgment can discern, of those who credibly profess repentance and faith, visibly marked by **believer's baptism**. He argues that this **regenerate membership** principle, when combined with a high view of **discipline**, yields a holy and missional church. In dialogue with contemporary reform movements such as **9Marks** and scholars like **Mark Dever** and **Jonathan Leeman**, he frames congregational authority in a Matthew 18 key, insists that the congregation as a whole holds the power of the **keys**, and locates **elders** as teaching and leading officers rather than sacramental priests.

#### 3. Biblical Foundations for Baptist Churches and the architecture of the church
The backbone of Hammett’s contribution is **Biblical Foundations for Baptist Churches** first published in 2005 and revised in 2019. The volume offers a comprehensive ecclesiology that moves from the nature of the church to its structure, membership, leadership, ordinances, discipline, and mission. At its core stands the thesis that the church is the **gathered people of God** constituted by the gospel and marked by **Word**, **ordinances**, and **discipline**. He argues that the church displays the kingdom in a proleptic manner, exercising the **keys of the kingdom** through admit-and-remove decisions over members and through binding-and-loosing judgments over doctrine and practice.

A notable element in this architecture is the insistence that **membership** is a covenantal reality. Hammett commends membership covenants, membership classes, and pastoral interviews as mechanisms that put theological integrity into local church rolls, thereby guarding **regenerate church membership**. He calls for the regular audit of inactive rolls and for humble but firm processes of **restorative discipline** grounded in **Matthew 18** and **1 Corinthians 5**. The aim is not punitive exclusion but the soteriological good of repentance and the doxological witness of the church’s holiness. This architectural vision is simultaneously doctrinal and procedural, rendering **ecclesial order** a dimension of sanctification.

#### 4. Elder-led congregationalism and the keys of the kingdom
On polity Hammett advocates **elder-led congregationalism**, pressing beyond older single-pastor models toward a New Testament pattern of plural **elders** with qualified **deacons** serving under the congregation’s final authority. Exegeting **Acts 14.23**, **Philippians 1.1**, **1 Timothy 3**, and **Titus 1**, he contends that plural elders are the ordinary norm and that deacons serve the unity of the Word-ministry by tending to material and mercy needs. The congregation, retaining the **keys of the kingdom**, bears responsibility to receive and remove members, to appoint officers, and to adjudicate matters of discipline and doctrinal boundaries.

Hammett engages **Presbyterian** and **Episcopal** alternatives with attention to their biblical appeals. He grants the strength of **Presbyterian connectionalism** in fostering accountability and catholicity but warns that graded courts may attenuate the priesthood of all believers and the textually grounded corporate role of the congregation in **Matthew 18**. He resists **Episcopal** hierarchical claims as lacking New Testament warrant for monarchical bishops. On gender and office he is **complementarian**, reading **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 11 and 14** as limiting the teaching office of elder to qualified men while insisting on the full ministry of women across the life of the church in non-elder roles. In all, polity is rendered as a means by which Christ rules his church through his **Word** by his **Spirit**.

#### 5. Membership, discipline, and pastoral jurisprudence
The pastoral jurisprudence of **membership and discipline** receives extended treatment in Hammett’s co-edited volume **Those Who Must Give an Account** published in 2012 with **Benjamin L. Merkle**. The essays supply exegetical, theological, historical, and practical frames for reestablishing **meaningful membership** in Baptist churches. Hammett stresses that discipline begins with formative discipleship and catechesis, not merely corrective measures, and that its goal is the **restoration** of the sinning brother or sister rather than public shaming. He maps due process with clear steps, multiple witnesses, congregational deliberation, and compassionate pastoral care, ensuring that **church discipline** reflects the gentleness and justice of the Chief Shepherd.

Crucially, Hammett ties **discipline** to the **Lord’s Supper** and the public naming of the church. Admission to the table signals the church’s judgment that one is united to Christ and his people, while removal from the table is the church’s sober declaration that fellowship is temporarily withdrawn for the purpose of repentance. He addresses contemporary legal concerns and trauma-aware pastoral sensitivities, arguing that biblically ordered processes actually protect the vulnerable and reestablish communal boundaries. Such jurisprudence is an enactment of **holiness** and **love**, and its neglect leaves the church exposed to scandal and spiritual anemia.

#### 6. Ordinances of baptism and the Lord’s Supper
Hammett’s **40 Questions About Baptism and the Lord’s Supper** published in 2015 is a catechetical tour through the **ordinances** that anchors Baptist practice in Scripture and clears pastoral thickets. On **baptism** he defends credobaptism, asserting that the ordinance is for professing believers who possess repentance and faith, with immersion as the biblically normative mode and local church membership as its ecclesial corollary. He treats the age of baptism with prudence, encourages pastoral discernment for children, and rejects rebaptism for those baptized as believers with adequate understanding, while urging those baptized as infants to receive believers baptism upon conversion.

On the **Lord’s Supper** Hammett frames the meal as covenantal **remembrance** and **proclamation** with a real spiritual benefit conveyed by the **Spirit** to faith, thus navigating between a purely **Zwinglian memorialism** and a metaphysical **transubstantiation**. He appreciates **Calvin’s spiritual presence** proposal while maintaining Baptist commitments to ordinance language and to non-objective grace apart from the Word and faith. Regarding communion practice he favors a **close communion** posture in which baptized believers, ordinarily members in good standing of a gospel church, are welcomed, though he recognizes pastoral reasons for broader admission. Frequency is left to prudence, though he notes the edifying case for more frequent celebration. Fencing the table belongs to the church’s exercise of the **keys**, joining ecclesiology and doxology in a visible act of discipline and delight.

#### 7. The gathered church, multi-site models, and cooperative mission
Because the church is the **ekklesia** that assembles, Hammett is cautious toward **multi-site churches** that disperse the congregation over multiple locations under a single governance and preaching ministry. He argues that such arrangements risk undermining the integrity of the **gathered church**, complicate the exercise of **discipline**, and obscure the visible sign-action of **ordinances** that presuppose a concrete assembly. He urges careful criteria for what constitutes one church rather than a network of churches, insisting that the New Testament picture accents identifiable membership, accountable shepherding, and face-to-face congregational deliberation.

Hammett balances this stress on local assembly with a strong affirmation of **associational cooperation** in Baptist life. The autonomy of the local church is not independence; it is stewardship under Christ that expresses catholicity through voluntary cooperation in associations, conventions, and mission boards. The **Great Commission** animates this cooperative instinct, and Hammett’s ecclesiology consistently ties internal order to outward mission so that polity never turns in on itself but serves the evangelization and discipling of the nations. Thus the church’s **holiness**, **unity**, and **order** are instrumental to its **witness**.

#### 8. Humanity, imago Dei, and pastoral anthropology
Though primarily known for ecclesiology, Hammett contributes to the **doctrine of humanity**, authoring chapters in **A Theology for the Church** in 2007 and its 2014 revision. He expounds the **imago Dei** as relational and functional, avoiding reduction to capacities alone, and grounds human dignity in creation under God’s lordship. Against contemporary **physicalism** and **nonreductive materialism**, he defends a modest **substance dualism** in which humans are a psychosomatic unity of body and soul, rejecting trichotomist divisions. He treats sin as a pervasive distortion of the image, yet anticipates its eschatological renewal in Christ, the true image.

Hammett’s anthropology underwrites his ecclesiology. The church is a communion of renewed image-bearers whose moral formation requires thick practices of **catechesis**, **discipline**, and **worship**, not consumer therapies. His **complementarianism** is rooted in creation order and redeemed patterns of mutuality and headship, aiming to honor equal dignity with asymmetrical role in the **elderate**. These anthropological commitments flow seamlessly into pastoral ethics on gender, sexuality, and life issues, reinforcing the local church as the primary theater of moral formation.

#### 9. Dialogue partners and a chastened Baptist catholicity
Hammett’s work engages a constellation of interlocutors to craft a chastened **Baptist catholicity**. He learns from **Stanley Hauerwas** and **John Howard Yoder** that the church is a distinct polis with a recognizable **discipline** and narrative, yet he resists any ecclesial ethic that eclipses evangelism and the **Great Commission**. He converses with **Gregg R. Allison** on ecclesial identity and with **Dever** and **Leeman** on the **keys of the kingdom**, congregational authority, and discipline, often refining and clarifying their proposals for broader Baptist reception. Historically he retrieves **Dagg** and **Carroll** to steady Baptist identity against **E. Y. Mullins’s** hyper-individualism, rehabilitating **soul competency** within a covenanted community.

With respect to the wider tradition he reads **Calvin** appreciatively on the **means of grace** and the **spiritual presence** in the Supper, though he retains Baptist ordinance language and cautions against sacramental objectification. He grants **Presbyterian** strengths in catechetical rigor and connectional oversight, but maintains that New Testament **congregationalism** better honors the texts that locate final judgments in the gathered assembly. This sober catholicity keeps Hammett’s Baptist distinctives porous to ecumenical learning without dissolving them.

#### 10. Reformed or WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Hammett’s ecclesiology commands significant respect. His retrieval of **regenerate church membership**, his insistence on **church discipline**, and his advocacy of **plural eldership** track closely with classical Reformed marks of the church. His guarded affirmation of the Spirit’s activity in the **Lord’s Supper** nudges memorialist Baptists toward a richer sacramental sensibility, and his critique of **multi-site** models aligns with a Reformed concern for the integrity of the **gathered assembly**. Yet principled tensions remain. The absence of a robust **covenant theology** that unites the **covenant of grace** across the testaments yields a thin account of the church’s continuity and thus excludes **paedobaptism** as the covenantal sign to believers and their children. The ordinance register underplays the Supper as a divinely appointed **means of grace**, risking a functional Zwinglianism despite salutary gestures toward **Calvin’s spiritual presence**. Congregational final authority, though textually defended, may succumb to majoritarian volatility absent **presbyterial** graded courts that safeguard discipline and doctrine with connectional accountability. A Westminster alternative would press a thicker **visible-invisible church** distinction, a covenantal rationale for **infant baptism**, and a sacramental realism governed by the **Word** and the **Spirit**, while welcoming Hammett’s resolve for meaningful membership, elder plurality, and pastoral discipline. The dialogue exposes genuine principled differences over **revelation and covenant**, not merely practice, yet it also identifies common ground in a shared desire for churches ordered by **Scripture**, ruled by Christ, and animated by the **gospel**.
