### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Thomas Weinandy, O.F.M. Cap., born 1946, emerges within the late twentieth-century Roman Catholic recovery of the Fathers and of **classical theism** amid ascendant proposals for a **passible God**. His career spans teaching at **Oxford’s Greyfriars** and service as Executive Director for Doctrine at the **USCCB** from 2005 to 2013, situating him at the nexus of academic and magisterial theology. His intellectual formation is avowedly **patristic-Thomist**, drawing sustainedly on **Athanasius**, **Cyril of Alexandria**, **Augustine**, and **Thomas Aquinas**. Methodologically, he wagers that sound exegesis proceeds by analogical metaphysics: the names predicated of God are true by **analogia entis**, not univocally, and the economy must be interpreted in light of **actus purus**, **divine simplicity**, and **immutability**. Against the drift of late-modern theology represented by **Jürgen Moltmann** and **Eberhard Jüngel**, Weinandy insists that the Christian confession of **impassible love** is not a Stoic residue but the very grammar of biblical monotheism clarified at **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon**.

The contextual foil for Weinandy’s oeuvre is the postwar turn to a God who suffers with the world. Re-interpretations of **Rahner’s rule** that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, combined with existential and political theologies, often yield a divine pathos responsive to history. Weinandy challenges this project by re-centering **dogmatic metaphysics** as the mode of safeguarding scriptural truth. He argues that a denial of **divine immutability** and **impassibility** undermines **aseity** and **simplicity**, dissolves the Creator-creature distinction, and imperils soteriology. At the same time, his method is profoundly Christological: the decisive answer to the pastoral appeal of a suffering God is the **incarnation** of the **impassible Word**, such that the **theopaschite** confession, One of the Trinity suffered *in the flesh*, secures both God’s transcendence and God’s salvific solidarity.

#### 2. Does God Change? The Word’s becoming and extrinsic denomination
Weinandy’s early monograph **Does God Change? The Word’s Becoming in the Incarnation** 1985 clarifies the metaphysical stakes of **incarnation** by deploying Thomist distinctions of *ad intra* and *ad extra*. He contends that while the **Logos** assumes a human nature in time, no alteration befalls the divine nature. Change is located in the created order as a new relation **ad extra**, signified in God by **extrinsic denomination**. The assumption of flesh instantiates a created relation to the Word; God’s eternal willing of the incarnation is one simple act, not a sequence of divine before-and-after. This preserves **divine simplicity** and **immutability** while enabling genuine historical novelty in Christ. For Weinandy, the **hypostatic union** entails that predicates of Christ’s humanity can be truly said of the divine person by the **communicatio idiomatum**, yet the metaphysical subject of union remains the impassible Word.

This argument responds to **kenotic Christologies** that posit a self-emptying of divine attributes. Weinandy rejects any model in which the Son surrenders omniscience or omnipotence, since such a move compromises **aseity** and the eternal **processions**. He retrieves **Athanasius** and **Cyril** to insist that the Word’s taking of flesh is an exercise of power, not a divestment. The result is a carefully tiered account of causality and predication: Christ’s weeping, ignorance, or suffering are truly those of the **Son of God**, yet they are suffered **according to the flesh**, while the divine nature remains impassible. Here Weinandy’s metaphysical precision serves a pastoral end: only if God remains immutable can the promises of grace be indefectibly reliable.

#### 3. Does God Suffer? Impassibility as the form of love
The mature statement of Weinandy’s proposal is **Does God Suffer?** 2000, a sustained response to **Moltmann**, **Jüngel**, **Pinnock**, and **Process** thinkers such as **Hartshorne**. He reframes **divine impassibility** not as emotional indifference but as the plenitude of **impassible love**, the intensity of which would be diminished were it susceptible to being altered by external events. On classical grounds, God is **actus purus**; to be affected is to receive act from another; thus a passible God would be composite and dependent, a denial of **divine simplicity**. Scriptural depictions of divine anger, repentance, or compassion are read through **analogical predication**, indicating God’s efficacious willing of justice and mercy rather than internal emotional flux. The pastoral concern that an impassible God cannot sympathize is answered Christologically: God the Son shares human suffering precisely by assuming a passible nature.

Weinandy’s theopaschite core is the Chalcedonian-safe claim that **unus de Trinitate passus est**. He traces conciliar and patristic warrants, showing how the **communicatio idiomatum** already authorizes saying God suffered without implying a change in deity. The **passion** is the passion of a divine person, which grounds infinite salvific worth, yet it is suffered *secundum humanitatem*. Contemporary alternatives that make divine suffering metaphysically intrinsic endanger the **Creator-creature distinction** and collapse **grace** into history. Weinandy insists that the cross discloses God’s unchangeable love rather than inaugurating a new affective state in God. Thus, the mystery of the crucified God is not the modification of deity but the presence of the impassible One in suffering by **assumptio carnis**.

#### 4. Trinitarian development: The Father’s Spirit of Sonship
In **The Father’s Spirit of Sonship: Reconceiving the Trinity** 1995, Weinandy offers a constructive trinitarian meditation that remains within Latin orthodoxy yet seeks to display the Spirit’s personal distinctiveness. Drawing from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, he affirms the **filioque** and the **monarchia Patris**, proposing that the **Holy Spirit** is the Father’s Spirit who perfects and delights in the Son’s filial relation, the **Spiritus caritatis**. The title signals his chief thesis: the Spirit is not merely the nexus amoris but the one in whom the Son’s sonship shines as gift, the plenitude of personal communion from the Father to the Son. Without making the Spirit a cause of the Son’s procession, the account accents how the Spirit’s mission manifests the Son’s **sonship** in believers, providing a pneumatological depth to adoption.

Weinandy’s interlocutors here include **Rahner**, whose axiom about the economic-immanent identity can suggest that history constitutes divine relations, and **Zizioulas**, whose relational ontology elevates personal communion. Weinandy’s Thomist reserve keeps the **divine processions** as archetypal and immutable while reading the missions as temporal expressions. The Spirit’s personal proprium is charity, but charity is identified with the one who is love as subsistent relation, consonant with **divine simplicity**. The payoff is soteriological: adoption in the **Spirit** is participation in the Son’s **filial** relation to the Father, grounding a robust doctrine of sanctification without compromising **immutability**.

#### 5. Christological synthesis and catechetical clarity
Weinandy’s **Jesus the Christ** 2003 distills his patristic-Thomist Christology for broader readership while maintaining scholarly rigor. The text unfolds the **two-natures** doctrine, the **hypostatic union**, and the **communicatio idiomatum** with repeated appeal to **Athanasius** and **Cyril**, joined to Aquinas’ precision on nature and person. He integrates soteriology by linking the **incarnation** to atonement: only the **impassible God** made passible in the flesh can offer a sacrifice of infinite worth, satisfying both the demands of justice and the superabundance of mercy. The canonical Christ is read through the metaphysical determinations recovered by the councils, so that Gospel narratives of ignorance, growth, and suffering are coordinated with **beatific knowledge** and divine prerogatives.

This work also evidences Weinandy’s commitment to catechesis and ecclesial service. During his years at the **USCCB**, he helped shape doctrinal clarifications that presuppose the same grammar of **classical theism**. His Christology resists modern reductions to exemplarism or event-theology by insisting on the ontological realism of the **Word made flesh**. Pedagogically, he treats **theopaschite** language as a pastoral treasure guarding both divine transcendence and proximity. Doctrinally, he reiterates that the **extra Calvinisticum** or, in Catholic idiom, the Logos remaining beyond the flesh, is not a denial of union but its necessary correlate.

#### 6. Patristic ressourcement: Athanasius and Cyril as masters
A notable feature of Weinandy’s scholarship is his retrieval of **Athanasius** and **Cyril of Alexandria** for contemporary dogmatics, visible in essays and in a study on **Athanasius** c. 2007. From **Athanasius**, he takes the axiom that only God saves and so the **homoousios** of the Son with the Father is soteriological necessity, not metaphysical luxury. From **Cyril**, he draws the unity of the subject in Christ, the one **Incarnate Word**, whose actions are theandric and whose sufferings belong to the divine person in the assumed nature. These patristic commitments underwrite his handling of **impassibility** and **immutability**: the Fathers safeguard transcendence while intensifying the realism of Christ’s passion.

Weinandy uses patristic sources not merely as historical evidence but as doctrinal norms within Catholic **ressourcement**. He reads **scripture** with the Fathers and disciplines modern hermeneutics by the settled **dogma** of the ecumenical councils. This generates a polemical edge against schools that relativize conciliar metaphysics, whether **Process** theology’s dipolar deity or **Open Theism’s** denial of exhaustive foreknowledge. In Weinandy’s judgment, to abandon the patristic metaphysical grammar is to lose the evangel in substance. Thus his patristic profiles are not antiquarian; they are constructive deployments of **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** logic for late-modern debates.

#### 7. Engagements and controversies in the ecclesial public square
Weinandy’s role at the **USCCB** and his appointment to the **International Theological Commission** reflect the ecclesial trust placed in his doctrinal clarity. His 2017 public critique of **Pope Francis** for sowing pastoral confusion, though controversial, indicates his conviction that **doctrine** requires unambiguous teaching anchored in **classical theism** and conciliar **Christology**. Whatever one judges of the prudence of that intervention, it shows an ecclesiology where **magisterial** responsibility and theological precision are mutually implicative. His interventions against **Open Theism** in ecumenical settings likewise show a willingness to contend for **immutability** and **impassibility** as articulations of the biblical God.

These public engagements also clarify Weinandy’s theological temperament. He is conciliatory toward legitimate development but skeptical of conceptual innovations that modify **divine simplicity** or depreciate metaphysics. He esteems **Aquinas** as a perennial teacher whose account of God as **actus purus** and of **analogical predication** remains the secure path for dogmatics. When engaging **Balthasar** or **Rahner**, he appropriates insights yet resists any hint that the **immanent Trinity** is constituted by history. His theological posture is thus ressourcement without revisionism.

#### 8. Doctrinal architecture: simplicity, analogy, and prayer
Across his corpus, Weinandy’s doctrinal architecture is dominated by **divine simplicity**, **analogical predication**, and practical implications for **providence** and **prayer**. Simplicity functions as the guarantor of all other perfections: God is not composed of act and potency, essence and existence, or parts and properties. From this, **immutability** and **impassibility** follow as modes of infinite perfection. Analogy governs speech about God, preventing both mute apophaticism and crude univocity. Under analogy, scriptural claims about God’s repentance or grief signify, in creaturely terms, the new effects of a single eternal will.

Weinandy applies this to **providence** and **petitionary prayer**. God’s one eternal act orders contingent events without coercion, so that prayers are truly used as means within the divine decree without implying a change in God. This is not fatalism but the liberating truth that the **Lord** hears because he eternally wills to hear. By uniting metaphysics to doxology, Weinandy seeks to show that **impassible love** is pastorally rich: because God cannot be turned aside by suffering, he can unfailingly deliver in suffering through the **passible flesh** of the **incarnate Word**.

#### 9. Strengths and pressure points within Catholic dogmatics
Weinandy’s strengths are considerable. He offers a lucid, confident re-presentation of **classical theism** in the idiom of **Aquinas** and the **Greek Fathers**, joining metaphysical rigor with evangelical proclamation. His Christological precision on the **communicatio idiomatum** and the **theopaschite** formula provides a decisive alternative to both **kenoticism** and modern pathos-theism. His trinitarian proposal in **The Father’s Spirit of Sonship** accents the **Holy Spirit’s** personal role in sanctification without compromising **filioque** or the **monarchia Patris**. Moreover, his catechetical work communicates complex doctrines for the Church’s life, not merely for the academy.

Pressure points include the risk, noted by some, that his pneumatological idiom could be read as making the **Spirit** constitutive of the **Son’s** identity rather than the radiance of the Son’s reception from the **Father**. Weinandy denies such constitutiveness, but the rhetoric of the Spirit as the form of sonship invites careful qualification in light of the **processions** ad intra. Similarly, his vigorous retrieval of **analogical predication** and **simplicity** must continually wrestle with biblical theologies that emphasize the drama of covenant history. Yet these tensions are internal to a living tradition, and Weinandy addresses them by deploying patristic hermeneutics rather than adjusting metaphysical commitments.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Weinandy is a formidable ally on **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, the **two-natures** doctrine, the **communicatio idiomatum**, and the **theopaschite** confession, as well as on the related **extra Calvinisticum** that protects the transcendence of the **Logos** in the incarnation. His distinction of *ad intra* and *ad extra* and use of **extrinsic denomination** mirror Reformed scholastic tools and help resist **Open Theism** and **Process** revisions. Two principled reservations arise. First, his reliance on the **analogia entis** and a natural-theological path can be judged, in a WTS register, to understate the principled **covenantal** mode of all true knowledge of God and to risk a shared being-scale between Creator and creature. Reformed dogmatics prefers talk of **archetypal-ectypal** knowledge and Scripture’s principium, even while employing analogy. Second, his ecclesial method, ordered by **magisterial** determinations, differs from **Sola Scriptura** as principium cognoscendi and from a redemptive-historical reading that regulates metaphysics by the drama of **covenant** without diluting **classical theism**. Nonetheless, on the central issues of **impassible love** and Christological realism, Weinandy’s project offers a rich resource that Reformed theology can appropriate with adjustments to epistemology and ecclesiology.
