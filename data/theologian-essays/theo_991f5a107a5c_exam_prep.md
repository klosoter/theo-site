### TITLE
Charles Hodge secures Old Princeton as the high-water mark of confessional, common-sense Reformed scholasticism, whose strengths and blind spots define the modern American Presbyterian tradition.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Charles Hodge** lived 1797–1878 and taught for over fifty years at **Princeton Seminary**, embodying Old School American Presbyterianism amid **Enlightenment** and **Second Great Awakening** pressures.
- He worked in the wake of **Scottish Common Sense Realism** and post-Kantian rationalism, defending a conservative **Reformed orthodoxy** in the face of **revivalism**, **German idealism**, and rising **liberal Protestantism**.

- Methodologically, **Hodge** treats theology as an inductive science, using **Scripture** as a collection of inspired facts to be organized by the redeemed intellect through a **common-sense realist** epistemology.
- He affirms **verbal plenary inspiration** and emphasizes **propositional revelation**, yet gives significant place to **reason** as ministerial, especially in natural theology and the defense of **Calvinist soteriology**.
- He assumes a strong continuity between **regenerate** and **unregenerate** use of reason in the so-called laws of belief, aligning theology with empirical **science** and resisting both **Rationalism** and **Mysticism**.

- In his three-volume **Systematic Theology** 1871–1873, Hodge offers a comprehensive, loci-ordered presentation of **Reformed dogmatics** rooted in the **Westminster Standards**.
- In **Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans** 1835 he defends **imputation**, federal headship, and forensic justification over against **Pelagian** and **New School** revisions.
- In **What Is Darwinism?** 1874 he critiques **evolutionary naturalism** as tantamount to **atheism**, yet distinguishes this from legitimate empirical science.
- In his **Commentary on 1 Corinthians** 1857 he addresses church order, sacraments, and gifts, shaping American **Presbyterian ecclesiology** and polemicizing against **revivalist** excess.

- Hodge is central for doctrines of **revelation and Scripture**, especially **inerrancy**, **inspiration**, and the relation of **reason** to revelation.
- He is consequential for **soteriology** and **justification**, defending **penal substitution**, **imputation**, and monergistic grace in continuity with **Calvin** and **Turretin**.
- His work on **church and culture**, including his responses to **Darwinism** and **modern science**, sets a template for conservative American engagement with **modernity**.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to affirm Hodge as a paradigmatic **confessional Reformed** theologian at Old Princeton while probing tensions between his **common-sense realism** and a fully **Van Tilian** epistemology.
- You should be ready to praise his defense of **inerrant Scripture** and **forensic justification**, yet qualify his more optimistic language about **natural theology** and **reason** post fall.

- For comparison, place **Hodge vs Schleiermacher** on the nature of theology as a science of revealed facts versus a description of religious consciousness.
- Also be prepared to contrast **Hodge vs Warfield / Van Til** on **apologetics** and **epistemology**, and **Hodge vs Bavinck** on the organic character of **revelation** and **dogmatics**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Charles **Hodge** was born in 1797 in Philadelphia and spent virtually his entire adult life at **Princeton Theological Seminary**, where he studied, then taught from 1822 until his death in 1878. Princeton at that time, under figures like **Archibald Alexander** and **Samuel Miller**, sought to consolidate a distinctly American **Old School Presbyterian** identity that was both confessionally Reformed and intellectually conversant with the **Enlightenment**. The seminary existed in a context shaped by the **Second Great Awakening**, the rise of **New School** moral and revivalistic theology, and transatlantic currents of **Scottish Common Sense Realism** and early **German theology**. Hodge thus grew up intellectually at a crossroads: between Old World Reformed scholasticism and New World democratic, revivalist, and rationalist impulses.

The driving problem that organizes Hodge’s career is how to preserve classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **Westminster Standards** in the context of modernity without retreating into obscurantism or capitulating to liberalism. He faces the twin threats of **Rationalism**, which subordinates revelation to autonomous reason, and **Subjectivism**, which relocates religion into inner feeling, as in **Schleiermacher**. Within American Presbyterianism he confronts the doctrinal innovations of **New Haven** theology, with its redefinitions of sin, ability, and atonement, and the broader moralistic trends of **New School Presbyterianism**. His project is to show that historic Calvinism is both faithful to Scripture and intellectually superior to its rivals, and that it can stand alongside the emerging prestige of **science** and **critical history**. Theologically, this yields a conception of dogmatics as an inductive, scientific system of biblical facts, defended through a realist epistemology, and deployed against both Pelagianizing soteriologies and modern anti-supernaturalism.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Hodge’s method is laid out programmatically in the opening volume of **Systematic Theology** 1871, where he defines theology as the science of the facts of **Scripture**, just as other sciences are the orderly arrangement of the facts of nature. He assumes, with **Scottish Common Sense Realism** from **Reid** and **Dugald Stewart**, that human cognition operates through trustworthy laws of belief, so that the mind is fitted to know reality as it is. On this basis, **revelation** is conceived primarily as divinely given propositions, especially in the Bible, which the theologian then collects, classifies, and harmonizes. Scripture is treated as a storehouse of inspired statements, and theology is an inductive, quasi-empirical science that draws doctrinal conclusions from these revealed data. Hodge therefore places enormous weight on verbal **inspiration** and **inerrancy**, arguing that if God is the ultimate author of Scripture, then Scripture as originally given must be without error in all that it affirms.

**Reason** for Hodge is not a source of revelation but a necessary instrument for understanding revelation and for doing **apologetics**. He explicitly rejects both **Rationalism**, which makes reason judge of what God may reveal, and **Mysticism**, which bypasses the external word. At the same time, he insists that reason has a ministerial task: it recognizes self-evident truths, deduces consequences from premises, and judges the validity of inferences. In **Systematic Theology** he speaks positively of **natural theology**, arguing that the existence of God, his attributes, and the fact of moral obligation can be known from creation and conscience even apart from Scripture. This is a clear point of tension with later **Van Tilian** critiques, since Hodge leans toward a relatively optimistic account of shared rational ground between believer and unbeliever. Nonetheless he insists that the full saving knowledge of God is possible only through **special revelation** in Christ and Scripture.

Experience and the **church** have a more subordinate role in Hodge’s method. He rejects **Schleiermacher’s** attempt to ground theology in the feeling of absolute dependence, insisting that religious experience must itself be judged by Scripture. Yet he does not ignore experience altogether. In treating **regeneration** and **sanctification**, Hodge appeals to the lived experience of believers, but always as effects of the Spirit that confirm what is taught in the Bible. The **history** and consensus of the church matter significantly as witnesses to the meaning of Scripture and as secondary authorities. Hodge stands self-consciously in continuity with **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and **Turretin**, and he deploys the **Reformed confessions** as accurate, though fallible, expositions of biblical doctrine. However, he refuses to grant tradition independent normative status. This Scripture-centered, inductive, confessional yet rational method undergirds his entire system and sets the stage for Old Princeton’s later development under **Warfield** and subsequent critique by **Van Til**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the confessional baseline is that God reveals himself generally in creation and specially in Christ and Scripture, and that Scripture is the inspired, infallible rule of faith and life. Hodge in **Systematic Theology, Volume 1** expounds **inspiration** in explicitly verbal plenary terms, arguing that the Holy Spirit so superintended the biblical authors that their words are the words of God, without destroying their personalities. Over against emerging **higher criticism** and early liberal trajectories, he insists that all Scripture is equally inspired, that it teaches truthfully not only in matters of faith and morals but also where it touches history and nature, and that the authority of Scripture is the authority of God himself. He engages **Rationalists** who deny the supernatural, and **Roman Catholics** who posit a dual source of revelation in Scripture and tradition. Hodge’s distinction between natural and supernatural revelation, and between the external Word and internal testimony of the Spirit, is firmly in line with **Calvin** and **Turretin**, though his highly propositional and fact-collecting approach to the Bible invites later criticism from **Bavinck** and **Vos**, who emphasize the organic, historical character of revelation.

Second, in **soteriology** and especially **justification**, the Reformed baseline is the forensic imputation of Christ’s righteousness received by faith alone, grounded in federal union with Christ, within an Augustinian doctrine of original sin and monergistic grace. Hodge’s **Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans** 1835 and his soteriological sections in **Systematic Theology, Volume 3** are landmark defenses of this scheme. Against **Pelagius**, **Semi-Pelagians**, and contemporary **New School** theologians like **Nathaniel Taylor**, he argues for the immediate imputation of Adam’s guilt, the total depravity of man, and the absolute necessity of efficacious grace. Justification for Hodge is strictly forensic, consisting in the pardon of sin and the imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience, with no infusion of righteousness. He criticizes **Roman Catholic** Tridentine teaching and also resists any blending of justification and sanctification in moralistic Protestantism. Here Hodge stands squarely with **Westminster** and earlier Reformed scholastics, preserving the classic federal and forensic structures that later become non-negotiable for conservative American Presbyterianism.

Third, in **Christology** and the person and work of Christ, the confessional baseline is the **Chalcedonian** doctrine of one person in two natures and a substitutionary atonement that is both penal and sacrificial. Hodge in **Systematic Theology, Volume 2** rehearses the patristic and Reformation consensus on the two natures and the communicatio idiomatum, aligning with **Calvin** and **Turretin** against both **Socinian** and **Rationalist** Christologies. At the level of the atonement he defends a fully **penal substitutionary** view, arguing that Christ bore the penalty of the law in the place of his people, thus satisfying divine justice. He rejects **Moral Influence** theories and **Governmental** atonement theories advanced by **Grotius** and modified by New England theologians, insisting that without a true substitutionary satisfaction there is no ground for free pardon. While he sometimes presents the atonement in more juridical and less explicitly covenantal terms than later **Vosian** biblical theology might prefer, Hodge’s robust defense of satisfaction and imputation provides a bulwark against liberal and moralistic dilutions.

Fourth, in the area of **church and culture** and the relation of theology to **science**, the confessional baseline is that Christ is Lord over all spheres, that the church is governed by Christ through his Word, and that nature and grace are distinct yet not opposed. In essays and in **What Is Darwinism?** 1874, Hodge tackles the challenges of **evolutionary theory** and modern science. He grants the legitimacy of empirical investigation and affirms that true science and true theology cannot ultimately conflict, because God is the author of both the book of nature and the book of Scripture. His core claim against Darwin is that **Darwinism**, as a comprehensive worldview, entails a denial of design and of a personal God, and is therefore essentially atheistic. He is less dogmatic on specific questions such as the age of the earth, but he insists that any evolutionary account that excludes divine purpose is incompatible with Christian theism. On ecclesiology, particularly in his **Commentary on 1 Corinthians**, he emphasizes Presbyterian polity, the spiritual nature of the church, and the ordinary means of grace over against **revivalist** and **perfectionist** movements. This combination of cautious engagement with science and strong defense of confessional church order sets a pattern for later conservative Reformed interaction with American culture.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
In relation to earlier Reformed orthodoxy, **Hodge** is largely a faithful heir of **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Confession**, especially in the loci of Scripture, God, Christ, sin, and salvation. He defends divine **simplicity**, immutability, and sovereignty, preserves a strong doctrine of election and reprobation, and upholds the classic Reformed covenantal structure with Adam as federal head. **Bavinck** later recognizes Old Princeton, including Hodge, as genuine continuators of Reformed scholasticism, though he gently criticizes the somewhat static, propositional way in which revelation is presented. **Vos** and **Machen**, both formed at Princeton, inherit Hodge’s confessional backbone and his high view of Scripture, yet they also develop a more organic, redemptive-historical approach that corrects the tendency to treat biblical texts merely as loci for proof texts. 

The major Westminster exam objections will center on epistemology and nature–grace issues, particularly when Hodge speaks of **natural theology** and the powers of **reason**. From a **Van Tilian** standpoint, Hodge’s reliance on **Common Sense Realism** appears to grant too much autonomy to the unbelieving mind and to underplay the noetic effects of sin. His easy assumption of shared rational principles can sound like a denial of the antithesis between belief and unbelief. Similarly, his heavy emphasis on Scripture as a collection of isolated facts for induction can be faulted for not sufficiently recognizing Christ as the organic center of revelation and the self-attesting character of the Word. Nonetheless, there are also important lessons for a Reformed theologian. Hodge models a robust commitment to **confessional** standards joined to serious engagement with contemporary philosophy and science. His thorough, careful exegesis, especially in **Romans**, and his unwavering defense of forensic justification and penal substitution, remain exemplary. Even his attempt to articulate theology as a science, though methodologically criticized, reflects a laudable desire to show that Christian doctrine is intellectually responsible and systematically coherent. The wise examiner will want a candidate to affirm Hodge’s doctrinal core while acknowledging these methodological tensions and appropriating later **Bavinck** and **Van Til** to refine his insights.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, safe opening sentences about **Hodge** would include statements like: Charles Hodge is the chief architect of Old Princeton theology and a leading nineteenth-century Reformed defender of the **Westminster Confession** against both rationalism and revivalist innovation. It is also safe to say that his **Systematic Theology** represents a high point of confessional Reformed dogmatics in America, even if later Reformed scholars refine his method. Another stable line is that Hodge robustly upholds **inerrant Scripture**, forensic justification by faith alone, and penal substitutionary atonement in continuity with **Calvin** and **Turretin**. You can present him as convinced that theology is a science of the facts of Scripture, interpreted under the guidance of the Spirit and in fellowship with the church.

You must, however, avoid unqualified praise of his **epistemology** in Van Tilian territory. Examiners will bristle if you simply applaud his **Common Sense Realism** or say that believers and unbelievers share a neutral rational ground without immediately qualifying this with the antithesis and the noetic effects of sin. Phrases like theology as a science of facts are fine, but you should quickly add that from a **Westminster** and **Van Til** perspective this needs to be complemented by a deeper recognition of the organic unity of Scripture in Christ and of the self-attesting character of revelation. Similarly, do not say that **Hodge** had a weak doctrine of inspiration or a proto-liberal view of Scripture, since he in fact is one of the stalwart defenders of **inerrancy**. Avoid anachronistic criticism such as accusing him of pure rationalism; instead, say that he resisted rationalism while still granting a more positive role to reason and natural theology than later presuppositionalists would.

Common misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the idea that **Old Princeton** was simply rationalistic or that Hodge’s theology is mere proof-texting without exegesis. You should counter that he was deeply exegetical, as seen in his **Romans** and **1 Corinthians** commentaries, and that his scholastic method served clear doctrinal ends. Another misunderstanding is that Hodge was hostile to all science; here you should emphasize that his critique in **What Is Darwinism?** targets Darwinism as a metaphysical denial of design, not empirical investigation as such. Finally, students sometimes underplay Hodge’s continuity with earlier Reformed scholastics. You should stress that he consciously aligns with **Turretin** and the **Reformed confessions**, and that the main area of revision in later Reformed thought concerns epistemology and the organic view of revelation, not the core dogmatic content. If you navigate these issues with clear acknowledgment of both strengths and weaknesses, you will demonstrate nuanced command of Hodge’s place in the Reformed tradition.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Charles **Hodge** is to be affirmed as a major conservative Reformed theologian whose confessional fidelity on **Scripture**, **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **soteriology** should be embraced, especially his robust defense of verbal inspiration, inerrancy, divine sovereignty, forensic justification, and penal substitution in the line of **Calvin** and **Turretin**; at the same time, we must deny as non-negotiable any tendency to treat human **reason** as religiously neutral or to speak of **natural theology** in a way that obscures the antithesis and the noetic effects of sin, and we must qualify his highly propositional, fact-collecting approach to revelation by insisting, with **Bavinck**, **Vos**, and **Van Til**, on the organic, Christocentric, and self-attesting character of Scripture; when asked where we land, we should say that we stand with Hodge in his doctrinal commitments and his courage against liberalism, but we appropriate later Reformed developments to recalibrate his epistemology and method so that they more fully reflect a consistently theocentric, covenantal, and presuppositional understanding of theology.
