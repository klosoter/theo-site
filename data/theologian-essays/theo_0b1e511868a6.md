### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Benjamin L. Gladd emerges within the contemporary **evangelical** recovery of **biblical theology** that followed the mid-twentieth century skepticism about **typology** expressed by figures like **James Barr** and the ensuing rehabilitation associated with **Geerhardus Vos** and **Herman Ridderbos**. Educated in the American evangelical academy and supervised by **G. K. Beale** at **Wheaton College** for doctoral work, Gladd inhabits a field shaped by the rediscovery of **Second Temple Jewish** literature, the centrality of **apocalyptic** motifs, and the priority of **canonical exegesis**. His teaching base at **Reformed Theological Seminary, Jackson** situates him at the intersection of **Reformed confessionalism** and broad evangelical scholarship, where the questions of **Scripture’s unity**, **Christological fulfillment**, and **inaugurated eschatology** animate both classroom and press.

Methodologically, Gladd’s reading of Scripture is **Christotelic** rather than reductionistically **Christomonistic**, which means the Old Testament is read toward Christ as telos without obscuring covenantal progression or **authorial intent**. He treats the **divine authorship** of Scripture as hermeneutically determinative in a controlled sense, allowing for the *sensus plenior* as divinely intended and canonically disclosed. Theologically, his categories are **inaugurated eschatology** and **new creation**, and hermeneutically they are **intertextual echoes** and **typology**. His use of **Second Temple texts** is heuristic rather than normative, positioning Jewish apocalyptic as a historical matrix that clarifies **biblical apocalyptic** while subordinating it to the canon’s own **covenantal** logic.

At the technical level, Gladd draws on **Richard B. Hays’s** criteria for **echo** and **allusion**, yet he relocates these within a stricter **canonical** and **covenantal** frame indebted to **Vos** and **Beale**. The impulses of **N. T. Wright’s** emphasis on **eschatology** and **exile–return** are present, though chastened by a Reformed commitment to **penal substitution**, **union with Christ**, and **covenant theology**. The fundamental governing conviction is that the **Old Testament** forms the conceptual and linguistic substructure for the **New Testament**, so that the latter cannot be rightly construed apart from the former’s **temple**, **exodus**, **wisdom**, and **kingdom** trajectories.

#### 2. Hidden But Now Revealed: mystery and apocalyptic disclosure
The collaborative volume **Hidden But Now Revealed: A Biblical Theology of Mystery** (2014), coauthored with **G. K. Beale**, serves as a programmatic statement for Gladd’s theological reading of **mystērion**. The thesis is that the biblical notion of **mystery** is not esoteric gnosis but the now disclosed plan of God, long embedded and veiled in the **Old Testament**, revealed in the fullness of time in **Christ** and the **Spirit**. The architecture of the book moves from **Daniel** to **Paul**, the **Gospels**, and **Revelation**, showing that the apocalyptic use of *raz* in **Daniel 2** and the Septuagintal **mystērion** converge in a canonical pattern of partial veiling and climactic unveiling.

This work’s significance lies in its integrated use of **Second Temple apocalyptic** as a historical feeder into a normative biblical-theological category. The authors argue that the mystery entails the inclusion of the **Gentiles**, the recapitulation of **Adam** and **Israel** in **Christ**, the **new covenant**, and the formation of the **eschatological temple** as the **church**. The hermeneutical implication is twofold: first, **typology** is not an optional overlay but the mode by which the scriptural authors mark the movement from promise to fulfillment; second, **divine authorship** permits that earlier Scripture contains deeper trajectories that only later revelation explicitly discloses. For Gladd, this locks together **canonical unity**, **apocalyptic unveiling**, and **inaugurated eschatology** into a single coherent account of **revelation**.

#### 3. Making All Things New: inaugurated eschatology for the church
In **Making All Things New: Inaugurated Eschatology for the Life of the Church** (2016), coauthored with **Matthew S. Harmon**, Gladd translates academic biblical theology into ecclesial practice. The central doctrine is the **already–not yet** of the kingdom, grounded in the resurrection and Pentecost as the onset of the **new creation**. The pastoral horizon includes **sanctification**, **mission**, **suffering**, **worship**, and **ethics**, all refracted through the lens of **eschatological identity**. The concept of **participation in Christ** or **union with Christ** organizes Christian existence as an advance installment of what will be consummated at the **parousia**.

This book’s theological contribution is a re-centering of the **eschatological temple** theme: the **Spirit** indwells the **church** as God’s end-time sanctuary, extending **Eden** through mission. The ethical shape of inaugurated eschatology resists triumphalism by insisting on the reality of the **not yet** and resists quietism by highlighting the real **already** of the **new creation**. This balance strengthens classic **Reformed sanctification** while integrating **mission** and **ecclesiology** within the same **kingdom** framework. The engine for this synthesis is Gladd’s conviction that **Old Testament** promises, once read typologically, are not merely illustrative but structurally constitutive of **New Testament** parenesis.

#### 4. From Adam and Israel to the Church: corporate solidarity and identity
With **From Adam and Israel to the Church: A Biblical Theology of the People of God** (2019), Gladd develops a canonical account of **corporate solidarity**. The through line is the priest-king vocation of **Adam**, reproduced in **Israel**, fulfilled in **Christ**, and extended to the **church**. Key texts include **Genesis 1–2** on image-bearing dominion, **Exodus 19** on kingdom of priests, **Psalm 8** on vicegerency, **Daniel 7** on the son of man and the saints, and **1 Peter 2** and **Revelation 5** on royal priesthood. The argument is that the **people of God** are not simply a faith aggregate but a corporate entity sharing in the identity and mission of their representative head, **Christ the last Adam**.

This volume consolidates several of Gladd’s hallmark themes. The **new creation** is not an abstract metaphysical upgrade but the reconstitution of humanity’s priest-king vocation in union with **Christ**. The **church** inherits and transforms the **Israel** identity not by displacement but by Christic fulfillment, which for Gladd underwrites a robust **continuity–discontinuity** pattern: the promises are yes and amen in **Christ**, and through union with him the **Gentiles** and the remnant of **Israel** are formed into one **eschatological people**. The **temple** motif threads the argument, as the Spirit-indwelt community is the living sanctuary that expands Edenic presence through **mission**. The conceptual tools are **typology**, **corporate solidarity**, and **inaugurated eschatology**, shaping a coherent ecclesial identity.

#### 5. The Story Retold and the architecture of biblical-theological exegesis
In **The Story Retold: A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament** (2020), coauthored with **G. K. Beale**, Gladd provides a pedagogical summary of his method in practice. Each New Testament book is introduced against the horizon of the **Old Testament storyline**: **creation**, **fall**, **covenants**, **exodus**, **kingdom**, **exile**, **return**, **wisdom**, **prophetic hope**, and **new creation**. The strength of the volume is its reconfiguration of traditional **NT Introduction** categories around **intertextual** and **typological** dynamics, so that the profile of, for example, **Matthew** or **Hebrews** is inseparable from **Torah**, **Psalms**, and **Prophets**.

This text anchors Gladd’s convictions in curricular form. It assumes **Scripture’s unity**, privileges **canonical context**, and treats **genre** and **historical setting** as servants to theological exegesis. The analytical focus is on **echoes**, **allusions**, and **citation** technique, moving beyond mere proof-texting toward a sensitivity to **narrative substructure**. By integrating **apocalyptic imagery** in **Revelation** with the **temple** and **new creation** themes, the work also displays how textual features and theological claims interpenetrate, which for Gladd is the essence of biblical-theological reading.

#### 6. The Dictionary of the NT Use of the OT: codifying the field
As co-editor of the **Dictionary of the New Testament Use of the Old Testament** (2023), alongside **G. K. Beale**, **D. A. Carson**, and **Andrew David Naselli**, Gladd helped to consolidate a field that had matured since the 2007 **Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament**. The **Dictionary** standardizes terminology for **citation**, **allusion**, **echo**, and **conceptual parallel**, offers book-by-book analyses of **OT-in-NT** usage, and provides essays on method, background, and theology. Gladd’s editorial fingerprints are seen in the balance between **linguistic criteria** for detecting allusion and a **canonical** commitment to **divine authorship** and **typology**.

The **Dictionary** signals methodological sobriety. It resists an overly permissive **intertextuality** that dissolves authorial intent into readerly construction, while also acknowledging the complexity of **Septuagintal** and **Hebrew** textual layers, **Second Temple** matrices, and the varying strategies of **Matthew**, **Paul**, **Hebrews**, and **Revelation**. This codification of the field offers a toolkit that guards against both atomistic proof-texting and uncontrolled intertextual free association, reflecting Gladd’s pursuit of **canonical coherence** tethered to **historical-grammatical** exegesis.

#### 7. Conceptual spine: new creation, temple, and apocalyptic realism
Across his corpus, three theological lines converge. First, **new creation** is the architectonic theme, rendering **salvation** as re-creation and **ethics** as the embodiment of the age to come in the present. Second, the **temple** motif serves as the spatial-ecclesial correlate of new creation, with the **Spirit** constituting the **church** as a living sanctuary that mediates divine presence to the world. Third, **apocalyptic realism** perceives history as invaded by the **eschatological** future, which clarifies the tension of the **already–not yet** and interprets suffering and mission as features of overlap between the ages.

These categories are not decorative. They do doctrinal work across **Christology** as last Adam and true temple, **Pneumatology** as eschatological down payment, **Ecclesiology** as royal priesthood, **Soteriology** as participation and transformation, **Missiology** as temple expansion, and **Eschatology** as consummated glory. The result is a holistic rendering of the **gospel** that threads together **covenant**, **kingdom**, **new covenant**, and **union with Christ**. The grounding is exegetical, yet the exposition functions at the level of **systematic coherence**, which is why Gladd’s works are as at home in dogmatic conversation as they are in biblical studies seminars.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and disciplinary location
Gladd’s conversation partners are emblematic of the field’s cross-pollination. From **Vos** and **Ridderbos** he inherits a **Reformed biblical theology** that emphasizes redemptive-historical development. From **Beale** he inherits rigorous attention to **apocalyptic** and **OT-in-NT** methodology. From **Hays** he appropriates the notion of **echo** and **figural** reading, though he reins it in through **authorial-intent** constraints. From **Wright**, he accepts a strong **eschatological** horizon and the story of **exile–return**, without collapsing juridical categories into narrative alone. Critics such as **James Barr** and **Stanley E. Porter** raise worries about **typology** and the evidentiary threshold for **allusion**, prompting Gladd to advocate clear criteria while maintaining **divine authorship** as hermeneutically meaningful.

Institutionally, Gladd’s home in **Reformed Theological Seminary** forms a base for bridging church and academy. His contributions to **curriculum** through works like **The Story Retold** and editorial leadership in the **Dictionary** position him as a standard-setter in pedagogy and reference. His focus on **mystery**, **already–not yet**, and the **people of God** consolidates evangelical commitments to **Sola Scriptura** and **Christ-centered** interpretation, while resisting both historical-critical reduction and postmodern **reader-response** instability. He thus stands as a representative figure in the consolidation of a confessional, academically rigorous **biblical-theological** method.

#### 9. Contributions to doctrine through exegesis
Though not a systematician in the classic sense, Gladd’s exegetical proposals bear doctrinal weight. Regarding **revelation**, the category of **mystery** grounds progressive disclosure without divorcing earlier from later **testaments**, securing both **continuity** and **eschatological newness**. In **Christology**, the **last Adam** identity underwrites federal headship, cosmic scope, and temple fulfillment. In **Ecclesiology**, the identity **Adam–Israel–Christ–church** yields a theology of the **royal priesthood** that integrates identity, mission, and holiness. In **Soteriology**, **union with Christ** and participation swirl with **justification** and **sanctification** under the umbrella of **new creation**. In **Eschatology**, the **already–not yet** of the kingdom disciplines both hope and patience.

Each doctrinal locus is scaffolded by **OT-in-NT** connections that are textually specific and canonically coherent. For instance, **Daniel 7**’s son of man shared sovereignty grounds **ecclesial participation** in royal authority through **Christ**, and **Exodus 19**’s priestly designation is rearticulated in **1 Peter 2** as the **church’s** priestly calling. The **temple** as axis of presence drives **sacramental** and **worship** implications, while **mission** is cast as temple expansion through witness, holiness, and suffering. This doctrinal fabric is distinctively **evangelical** and recognizably **Reformed** in tone, balancing biblical-theological synthesis with dogmatic clarity.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Gladd’s work is a model of **Vosian** biblical theology consciously tethered to **Sola Scriptura**, **covenant theology**, and **Christ-centered** exegesis. Strengths include a disciplined account of **typology** under **divine authorship**, a pastorally rich deployment of **inaugurated eschatology**, and a churchly vision of **temple** and **mission** that integrates **ecclesiology** with **eschatology**. Tensions remain at three points. First, the extension of **typological** trajectories risks overreach if the canon’s constraints and **authorial intent** are not painstakingly demonstrated; a stricter use of the **analogia fidei** and confessional **hermeneutical** boundaries can mitigate slippage from **typology** into allegorizing. Second, reliance on **Second Temple backgrounds**, while illuminating, must be subordinated to **canonical primacy** so that explanatory frameworks do not invert norm and help; here the **grammatico-historical** method with a strong **covenantal** overlay should govern. Third, the **Israel–church** continuity in the **Adam–Israel–Christ–church** schema must be articulated with classical **covenant theology** in view, safeguarding the abiding significance of **Israel** in redemptive history without collapsing the distinct economies of old and new covenants. On balance, however, Gladd’s constructive vision coheres with **Westminster** commitments to **Scripture’s unity**, **federal theology**, and **Christ’s** mediatorial centrality, offering a fruitful pathway for sustaining confessional orthodoxy through biblically dense, canonically integrated exegesis.
