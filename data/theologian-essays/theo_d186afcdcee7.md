### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Ruha Benjamin operates within the contemporary convergence of **science and technology studies** and **Black radical thought**, reading code, platforms, and institutions as condensations of **racialized power**. With a PhD in sociology in 2008 and appointments leading to Princeton by mid-2010s, she contributes to and reframes the STS canon seeded by **Donna Haraway** and **Bruno Latour** through the analytic of **race**, **abolition**, and **design**. The institutional founding of the **Just Data Lab** at Princeton signals a praxis-oriented method, choreographing students, communities, and publics around **counter-data**, **civic technoscience**, and **design justice**. Her context is the post-2008 financial and technological consolidation in which **platform capitalism** and **algorithmic governance** mediate work, policing, education, and health. To this she brings an epistemic stance that weds **ethnography** to **critical discourse analysis**, and that privileges **abolitionist imagination** over mere reformist tinkering, insisting that tools we build encode **world-making**. The methodological horizon is thus both descriptive and normative, a stance indebted to **critical race theory** and **Black feminist theory** that treats classification, measurement, and optimization as moral technologies.

Benjamin names her style of analysis as tracking **sociotechnical imaginaries**, borrowing from STS while saturating the term with the history of **Jim Crow** and **racial capitalism**. The wager is that imagination itself is a site of struggle: whose visions get materialized into standards, datasets, and interfaces. She canvasses a diverse archive of policy documents, corporate white papers, patents, and everyday user practices, weaving them into a grammar of **discriminatory design**. Methodologically, she oscillates between micro ethnographies and macro critique of **infrastructure**, and she invites **speculative methods** from art and fiction to prototype liberatory futures. Her prose is pedagogical and public-facing, yet conceptually dense, repeatedly pressing the reader to see that a line of code is never just technical but an inscription of **power**, **value**, and **risk**.

#### 2. Early work: biotechnology and rights
Her first monograph, **People's Science: Bodies and Rights on the Stem Cell Frontier** 2013, situates debates about stem cells, property, and bodily autonomy within a contested terrain of **biocitizenship**. Here she tracks how the promise of regenerative medicine intersects with regimes of **intellectual property**, **ethics review**, and the commodification of tissues. The argument is not that science is a monolith but that competing **sociotechnical imaginaries** struggle to define what counts as **public good**. Benjamin details how aspirational narratives of cure and progress can occlude consent and exacerbate inequalities when **biocapital** aligns with legal frameworks that privilege some bodies over others. In this register, she anticipates her later language of **discriminatory design**, showing that institutions craft rights as they craft protocols, and that notions like **informed consent** can mask structural asymmetries.

The book is a case study in how **law**, **market**, and **laboratory** co-produce new moral topographies. Benjamin articulates the tension between **expert authority** and **lay advocacy**, discerning moments where communities assert **collective rights** against extractive research arrangements. She adopts a method that refuses to separate **normativity** from **empirics**, arguing that any adequate account of bioscience must attend to distributive **justice**. Already visible is the seed of an abolitionist tilt: scientific futures need not be surrendered to incumbent elites; they can be reframed by grassroots counter-publics that insist on **people's science** as a practice of solidarity and accountability.

#### 3. Algorithms and the New Jim Code
Benjamin's signature contribution arrives with **Race After Technology: Abolitionist Tools for the New Jim Code** 2019. The book coins the phrase **New Jim Code** to name innovations that seem impartial but reproduce **segregation**, **surveillance**, and **stratification** under the veneer of objectivity. The argument proceeds through vivid cases: risk assessment in criminal justice, automated hiring, predictive policing, facial recognition, and edtech. She synthesizes and extends adjacent work by **Simone Browne** on dark matters of surveillance, **Safiya Noble** on algorithms of oppression, and **Virginia Eubanks** on automating inequality. The conceptual kernel is that **default discrimination** is often baked into data regimes by historical training sets, proxy variables, and optimization targets defined by institutions that benefit from existing hierarchies. The problem is not only biased inputs but the goals and imaginaries of systems that prize **efficiency** over **equity**.

Benjamin distinguishes between four modes of the **New Jim Code**: engineered inequity, default discrimination, coded exposure, and technochauvinism. Each demonstrates how **racialized harm** can flourish without explicit animus, because design choices transpose old hierarchies into new infrastructures. She resists a purely technical fix, warning that more data or better models can deepen **carcerality** if the underlying social order remains intact. Her constructive turn is to assemble **abolitionist tools**: audits, community oversight, algorithmic exegesis, and creative refusal. She reframes critique as pedagogy for collective action, and she grounds technical literacy in civic literacy, insisting that the ultimate horizon is not merely fairer predictions but **transformed institutions** that cease to outsource moral judgment to machines.

#### 4. Carceral technoscience and the politics of captivation
In the edited volume **Captivating Technology: Race, Carceral Technoscience, and Liberatory Imagination in Everyday Life** 2019, Benjamin curates essays that trace how **carcerality** bleeds beyond prisons into schools, hospitals, welfare systems, and workplace surveillance. The term **carceral technoscience** captures the fusion of constraint and calculation by which institutions manage populations through data. Contributors show how **risk logics** and **actuarial thinking** embed punishment in mundane tools: ankle monitors, drug tests, attendance trackers, and predictive dashboards. Benjamin's editorial thesis advances the idea that to be captivated is both to be held and to be fascinated, exposing the seductions by which punitive technologies appear as **innovation** and **safety**.

The volume also stages an alternative: **liberatory imagination** anchored in historical movements and everyday practices that refuse the common sense of punishment. Benjamin amplifies voices from community organizers, artists, and scholars, lifting **abolition** as a creative project of building life-giving institutions. The essays collectively display how the **New Jim Code** is not an abstract system but a lived interface that shapes affect and expectation. By naming and narrating carceral logics, the book equips readers with conceptual tools to diagnose engineering choices as moral choices, situating technical design within a broader **political theology of punishment** even when the language is secular.

#### 5. Viral Justice: small change, fractal repair
With **Viral Justice: How We Grow the World We Want** 2022, Benjamin shifts register. Against grand, centralized fixes, she posits **viral justice**, a metaphor for small, replicable acts that spread repair across networks. The book combines reportage, memoir, and analytical vignettes, drawn from the pandemic years when **public health**, **racial justice**, and **economic precarity** collided. The notion of viral is double: it indicts the virality of misinformation and contagion while reclaiming virality as a pattern of mutual aid, neighborliness, and institutional redesign at scale through **distributed agency**. Benjamin critiques **technological solutionism** and narrates community experiments that rewire defaults: mutual aid funds, participatory budgeting, restorative circles, and campus policy reforms.

Theologically suggestive is the grammar of **repair**, **care**, and **solidarity**, though her sources remain secular and movement-based. The thrust is to expand the moral imagination so that anti-racist work is not a niche but the ordinary warp and weft of life. **Viral justice** complements earlier calls for **abolitionist tools** by insisting on habit formation and institutional seedlings that can survive hostile environments. The argument retains the analytic of **discriminatory design** while pivoting toward constructive design, offering a pedagogy for cultivating communities skilled at routing around harmful infrastructures through creative recombination.

#### 6. Imagination: a manifesto for futures work
In **Imagination: A Manifesto** 2024, Benjamin distills a thesis that has threaded her oeuvre: imagination is a contested infrastructure. She argues that **racialized power** constrains who gets to imagine and whose visions are resourced into policy, platforms, and buildings. Drawing on **W. E. B. Du Bois**, **Audre Lorde**, and **Angela Davis**, she frames imagination as a muscle that can be disciplined by institutions or nurtured by **abolitionist pedagogy**. The manifesto proceeds as exhortation and method, presenting principles and practices that democratize future-making: **storytelling**, **speculative design**, **counter-mapping**, and **collective prototyping**. In this literature, to imagine otherwise is not escapism but material intervention, because narratives and prototypes guide investments and standards.

Benjamin locates **imagination** within the political economy of attention and venture capital, showing how concentrated funding pipelines render some futures inevitable and others unimaginable. She calls for **redistributive patronage** of imagination, amplifying civic labs, public libraries, and community studios as infrastructures of **design justice**. The book is a bid to move imagination from soft skill to strategic resource, and to entangle it with the critique of **carceral technoscience**. Here the conceptual triad is explicit: name the **New Jim Code**, seed **viral justice**, and organize imagination so that alternative infrastructures can be built and maintained.

#### 7. Thematic synthesis: power, design, and abolition
Across these works, several themes recur as doctrinal in scope for any social theology of technology. First, **race as technology**: Benjamin treats race not simply as identity but as a set of design decisions, data schemas, and enforcement routines that stabilize hierarchy. Second, **design as moral ontology**: tools do not sit atop society; they inscribe **norms**, **risks**, and **values** into everyday life. Third, **abolition as constructive politics**: the absence of cages implies the presence of care infrastructures, replacing punitive **risk logics** with **mutual aid** and **restorative practices**. Fourth, **imagination as infrastructure**: future-making is a distributive question, and justice requires democratizing who funds and influences **sociotechnical imaginaries**. These claims are elaborated with granular case studies that expose **discriminatory design** while training readers to adopt **abolitionist tools**.

Benjamin also clarifies misdiagnoses: the problem is not bad apples or noisy datasets but governance targets and organizational defaults. Her focus on **default discrimination** is a theory of sin without recourse to inward intention, highlighting how harm flows through seemingly neutral channels. Correspondingly, her recommended practices reject both naive neutrality and techno-cynicism; they insist on building counter-institutions that can survive contact with power. This synthesis makes her a pivotal voice in debates over **AI ethics**, **platform regulation**, and **public interest technology**, because it refuses to isolate technical questions from political and moral worlds.

#### 8. Interlocutors and disciplinary positioning
Benjamin's arguments resonate with and revise core STS claims from **Latour** about co-production and from **Haraway** about situated knowledges, while directing them through the lens of **Black studies** and **abolition**. She draws from **Michelle Alexander's** thesis of **The New Jim Crow** to coin the **New Jim Code**, and stands in solidarity with **Ruth Wilson Gilmore's** definition of abolition as presence, not absence. She coordinates with **Kimberle Crenshaw's** **intersectionality**, and tracks the bureaucratic life of power through a Foucauldian attention to discipline and biopolitics. Alongside **Safiya Noble**, **Simone Browne**, and **Virginia Eubanks**, she helps consolidate an ethics of **algorithmic justice**. Her institutional practice via the **Just Data Lab** places her among public scholars who craft **counter-archives** and teaching tools, animating theory through curricular and community work.

At the same time, Benjamin stakes positions against narratives of **technological neutrality** and against mere compliance regimes that leave architectures intact. She is skeptical of corporate **ethics-washing** and of regulatory frames that emphasize transparency without redistribution of power. She prefers **community governance** models and insists that the measure of an intervention is downstream material change in the lives of those historically targeted by **carceral technoscience**. This marks her as a critical yet constructive voice, attentive to institutional design and not simply to rhetoric.

#### 9. Normative cadence and moral anthropology
Although Benjamin writes as a sociologist, her corpus implies a thick moral anthropology. She assumes human agents are simultaneously inventive and enmeshed in structures of **racial capitalism**, and that institutions can habituate either cruelty or care. Her accounts of **viral justice** presuppose that moral formation is incremental and distributed, and that imagination can be trained toward solidarity. She resists reductive individualism in favor of relational accounts where **infrastructure** and **policy** scaffold possibility. If there is an eschatology, it is immanent and abolitionist: the horizon is a world organized around **repair**, not revenge, achieved through cumulative redesign of sociotechnical life.

Crucially, her refusal of **technological neutrality** is paired with a refusal of despair. The double move is diagnostic and constructive: name the **New Jim Code**, then assemble **abolitionist tools** that design different defaults. Moral responsibility is thus collective and iterative, lodged in procurement decisions, budget allocations, code repositories, and everyday practices. The telos is not purist withdrawal but **civic technoscience** reoriented toward the flourishing of those historically harmed. This is a normative project of public ethics that invites allied disciplines, including theology, to clarify their visions of justice, responsibility, and the good.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage shaped by **creation-fall-redemption-consummation**, Benjamin's corpus offers sharp alignment and sharp tension. Positively, her denial of **technological neutrality** and her mapping of **default discrimination** accord with **total depravity** extended to structures, not merely individuals. Her exposure of **idolatry of technique** and of **carceral technoscience** coheres with a doctrine of the **principalities and powers** and with covenantal warnings against partiality in judgment. Her constructive emphasis on **repair**, **solidarity**, and **institution-building** resonates with **common grace** and with a Kuyperian sense that Christ claims every square inch, including standards, datasets, and procurement law. Yet her eschatological horizon remains immanent and abolitionist, lacking the sacramental and doxological anchoring of **union with Christ** and the **kingdom of God**. The grammar of liberation sometimes risks collapsing sin into structures alone, under-describing **concupiscence** and the noetic effects of sin in hearts that design and use tools. A Reformed alternative would retain her systemic diagnoses while situating them within a covenantal doctrine of justice ordered by the **moral law**, a robust account of **vocation** and **sphere sovereignty** to diversify institutional power, and an explicitly christological telos where **providence** governs technological history toward consummation. Such an integration would commend Benjamin's **abolitionist tools** as instruments of neighbor love under the cross, while guarding against utopian immanentism by rooting repair in grace, repentance, and the hope of resurrection.
