### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Kevin DeYoung emerged as a prominent **Reformed pastor-theologian** in the first decades of the twenty-first century, ministering amid the volatility of **American evangelicalism** and the internal recalibrations of the **young, restless, and Reformed** renewal. His pastoral trajectory from **University Reformed Church** in East Lansing to **Christ Covenant Church** in Matthews in 2017, together with his appointment as a professor of **systematic theology at RTS Charlotte**, situates him in an institutional and ecclesial nexus that prizes **confessional Presbyterian orthodoxy**. This setting explains his consistent emphasis on **catechesis**, **ordinary means of grace**, and the **church as church**, even as he writes for broad evangelical audiences. Theologically, DeYoung is a practitioner of **confessional retrieval**, mining **Heidelberg**, **Westminster**, and **Dort** for pastoral clarity, and a practitioner of pastoral exegesis governed by **sola Scriptura**, the **perspicuitas Scripturae**, and the **analogia fidei**. His prose embodies a method of rhetorical ordering, thesis-driven argument, and canonical reasoning that assumes the **self-authenticating** character of Scripture, the Greek term **autopistos**, and aligns with the older Reformed conviction that the divine Word is both clear and sufficient.

DeYoung’s historical context includes the collapse of the **emergent church** project, the rise of various **missional** paradigms, intensifying cultural conflict over **sexual ethics**, and intramural disputes over **sanctification** and the shape of **public theology**. His early interventions with **Ted Kluck** in Why We’re Not Emergent in 2008 and Why We Love the Church in 2009 signaled a sensibility resistant to innovation-by-ambiguity and attached to **ordinary ecclesial faithfulness**. He led his Michigan congregation from the **Reformed Church in America** into the **United Reformed Churches in North America** in 2015, a denominational move reflective of his anchor in **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**. The arc of his public work from **mission** to **sanctification**, **bibliology**, **sexual ethics**, and **creational order** demonstrates a method where doctrinal loci are deployed to meet concrete problems while reinforcing a stable **Reformed dogmatic center**.

#### 2. Canon, confession, and the mission of the church
The core of DeYoung’s method rests on **bibliology** and **ecclesiology**, articulated in **Taking God at His Word** in 2014 and **What Is the Mission of the Church?** with **Greg Gilbert** in 2011. In the former, he systematically expounds the **authority**, **inerrancy**, **clarity**, and **sufficiency** of Scripture, framing the divine Word as the church’s normative charter and the Christian’s sure rule. He draws on classic Reformed confessional language and on the theological instinct that Scripture’s clarity is pastoral, producing confidence rather than hesitation in moral and doctrinal discernment. His stress on **sufficiency** rejects a functional biblicism and secures space for **creational wisdom** and **confessional norms**, yet insists that no extra-biblical authority can bind conscience as Scripture does. The conceptual center is **sola Scriptura** read with the **church catholic**, a *cum ecclesia* stance that treats confessions as subordinate standards under the supreme standard of the Word.

In **What Is the Mission of the Church?** DeYoung and Gilbert draw a sharp distinction between the church’s **Great Commission** mandate and broader categories of **social renewal** often captured by the language of **shalom**. The thesis is a deliberate delimitation: the institutional church’s mission is **disciple making**, **baptizing**, **teaching** everything Christ commanded, while Christians as members of society pursue vocations for the **common good**. This articulation stands against missional programs that identify the church’s mission with generalized cultural transformation. It deploys a Reformed sense of **two-kingdoms** or better **twofold reign** prudence without committing to any one technical model, arises from exegesis of **Matthew 28**, **Luke-Acts**, and **Pauline ecclesiology**, and aligns with **Augustinian** realism about the saeculum. Critical interlocutors include **Christopher J. H. Wright** and **N. T. Wright**, whose broad-messianic readings of mission are engaged carefully but resisted, while friendly conversation with **Tim Keller** on cultural engagement reveals overlapping instincts with differing emphases on **institutional competencies**.

#### 3. Holiness, law and gospel, and the ordo salutis
The second major axis of DeYoung’s work is **sanctification**. **The Hole in Our Holiness** in 2012 responds to a perceived antinomian drift in some gospel-centered rhetoric, contending for holiness as the necessary fruit of **justification** and **union with Christ**, with the **law** as a gracious rule of life. The work insists on the Reformed distinction of **law and gospel** without separation, affirming that the gospel frees and enlivens to **obedience**. DeYoung situates **mortification** and **vivification** within the **ordo salutis**, showing pastoral concern for the dynamics of assurance, effort, and spiritual disciplines. He argues that sanctification is Spirit-wrought yet humanly active under grace, and that the **ordinary means of grace** shape the habitus of holiness in the church.

This pastoral moral theology is extended in **The Ten Commandments** in 2018, where DeYoung retrieves the **third use of the law** for Christian ethics, and in **Impossible Christianity** in 2023, where he counters a perfectionist despair and a performative activism by grounding discipleship in Christ’s yoke as easy and burden light. The controversies with **Tullian Tchividjian** and associated antinomian proposals form a backdrop, as does an ecclesial need for clear catechesis that refuses moralism while refusing undefined license. The guiding doctrinal tools are **union with Christ**, **definitive and progressive sanctification**, **adoption**, and the positive role of **lex** under **gratia**.

#### 4. Confessional Calvinism and the doctrines of grace
DeYoung’s confessional center is visible in **The Good News We Almost Forgot** in 2010 and **Grace Defined and Defended** in 2019. The former walks through the **Heidelberg Catechism** week by week, retrieving its structure of **guilt, grace, and gratitude** and its warmly devotional **Christocentrism**. The latter offers an exposition of the **Canons of Dort** on the 400th anniversary of the **Synod of Dort**, presenting the doctrines of grace with exegetical and pastoral clarity. DeYoung’s treatment of **unconditional election**, **definite atonement**, **total depravity**, **effectual calling**, and **perseverance** frames them not as bare determinism but as the grammar of divine mercy that produces assurance and humility.

In these works he models a **catechetical dogmatics** that binds systematic clarity to spiritual formation. The **Westminster Standards** and **Heidelberg** serve as interpretive guides for Scripture, not rivals, and **Dort** becomes a pastoral map rather than a polemical badge. The emphasis on **definite atonement** is harmonized with the universal preaching of the gospel, and **assurance** is grounded in the promissory objectivity of the Word and sacraments and the Spirit’s inward testimony. Through these expositions DeYoung participates in a wider Reformed trend of **orthodox retrieval**, alongside figures like **Michael Horton** and **Scott Swain**, but with a populist pastoral angle that aims at congregational catechesis.

#### 5. Anthropological order, sexuality, and creational givens
DeYoung’s interventions in **anthropology** and **ethics** concentrate on **sexuality** and **gender** as contested late-modern sites. **What Does the Bible Really Teach About Homosexuality?** in 2015 is a close exegetical argument across **Genesis 1–2**, **Leviticus**, **Romans 1**, and Pauline household codes, with a canonical summary rejecting same-sex sexual relationships as contrary to **creational norms** and to the **holiness** to which the church is called. The book engages **Matthew Vines**, **James Brownson**, and broader revisionist claims, refuting appeals to hospitality and justice detached from biblical moral ontology. DeYoung’s style is patient and scriptural, tethering the argument to **creation order**, **Christology**, and **eschatological hope**.

In **Men and Women in the Church** in 2021 he further articulates **complementarianism**, grounding **male eldership** and differentiated roles in the order of **creation** and the exegesis of **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 11–14**, while insisting on the spiritual equality and mutual dignity of women and men in **union with Christ**. The argument reflects the legacy of **CBMW**, with resonances of **Wayne Grudem** and **John Piper**, yet filters those commitments through a calm pastoral tone and a focus on the local church. In addressing so-called **Side B** approaches to sexuality within confessional churches, DeYoung has urged fidelity to biblical categories of identity and repentance, seeking to guard **sanctification** and **holiness** while exercising **pastoral care** for strugglers. This constellation of positions marks a **creational realism** shaped by **natural law** instincts subordinate to Scripture, and a Reformed anthropology that treats the **imago Dei** as teleologically ordered to God.

#### 6. Ecclesial love, prudence, and cultural discipleship
While dogmatically rooted, DeYoung’s oeuvre also concerns **ecclesial practice** and **cultural prudence**. In Why We Love the Church in 2009, he and **Ted Kluck** defend the institutional church against consumerist spirituality and performative authenticity, retrieving **Word, sacrament, and discipline** as the loci of Christ’s presence. **Just Do Something** in 2009 promotes providential trust and ordinary obedience against paralysis over personal guidance, drawing on **Proverbs** and a Reformed doctrine of **providence**. **Crazy Busy** in 2013 interprets restlessness and distraction as spiritual maladies addressed by **Sabbath wisdom**, modest habits, and re-ordered loves.

On the public square, DeYoung’s essays and reviews show a sympathy for principled **two-kingdoms** prudence and a wariness of civil-religious fusion. His extended critique of **Stephen Wolfe’s** The Case for Christian Nationalism in 2023 rejects over-realized and ethnonational construals of civil order, urging instead a **catholic Protestant** approach to **natural law**, **general revelation**, and the legitimate yet limited aims of the magistrate. He frequently commends **Augustinian realism** and the distinction between the **spiritual mission** of the church and the **civic vocation** of Christians, echoing **Calvin’s** duplex regimen and the confessional language that guards the spirituality of the church while refusing quietism. This prudential posture differentiates him from both **integralist** projects and from **progressive activism**, and it coheres with his earlier delimitation of ecclesial mission.

#### 7. Scripture as canon for the church catholic
DeYoung’s **Taking God at His Word** crystallizes his bibliology as the keystone of his entire project. The book presents the **attributes of Scripture** in a pedagogical order: clarity, authority, necessity, and sufficiency. He treats the canon as the final court of appeal for doctrine and ethics, yet insists that the church reads the canon **with** the church, not against it, thus giving a **confessional hermeneutic** that avoids **solo Scriptura**. He frequently appeals to the **autopistia** of Scripture, the Spirit’s inward work supplying certainty, a theme drawn from **Westminster Confession 1.5** and classic Reformed **epistemology of faith**. His polemical edge is evident in challenges to approaches associated with **Peter Enns** and post-conservative revisions of **inerrancy**, and he reiterates that historical genre sensitivity strengthens rather than weakens confidence in **verbal plenary inspiration**.

This bibliological core enables his arguments in **sexual ethics**, **sanctification**, **mission**, and **complementarianism** to proceed without embarrassment. The same confidence underwrites his catechetical resources such as **The Biggest Story** in 2015 and **The Biggest Story Bible Storybook** in 2022, where he narrates the **canonical storyline** of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation for families and children. The pedagogy embodies what older Reformed writers termed **pietas**, a sanctified wisdom that grows by hearing and doing the Word in the fellowship of the church.

#### 8. Voice, style, and interlocutors
As a communicator, DeYoung is marked by enumerated clarity, regular **lists and theses**, and an instinct for **doctrinal triage** that places **Christology**, **Trinity**, and **atonement** at the center while refusing to marginalize ecclesiology and ethics. He writes with pastoral urgency rather than scholastic technicality, yet he is consistently **classically Reformed** in doctrinal content. His interlocutors are various: the **emergent church** and its epistemic skepticism, the **missional** movement’s broad mandates, revisionists on **sexual ethics**, and both antinomian and moralistic distortions of **sanctification**. Friendly engagements with **Tim Keller** exhibit alignment on **cultural apologetics** and city-centered mission, with DeYoung more insistent on organizational limits and **confessional specificity**. His public-theology essays reveal a willingness to confront new-right **Christian nationalism** and to critique left-leaning **social-justice ecclesiologies**, aiming to stabilize evangelicals within **confessional Protestant** boundaries.

The cumulative effect is a body of work that behaves like **catechesis** for late modernity: concise volumes that explain big truths, correct confusions, and build confidence in the **ordinary Christian life**. DeYoung stands as a translator of the **Reformed scholastic** and **Puritan** heritage for a digitally distracted age, pressing the **ordinary means of grace**, the **discipline of church membership**, and the **joy of holiness** against spiritual exhaustion and ideological capture.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, DeYoung’s project is a salutary example of **orthodox retrieval** meeting pastoral exigencies. His confessional commitments, defense of **sufficiency and clarity of Scripture**, insistence on **ordinary means**, articulation of **law and gospel**, and delimitation of the church’s **Great Commission** mission align with **Westminster** principles of revelation, covenant, and church. Tensions appear in two areas. First, his delimitation of mission, though carefully framed, faces the perennial Reformed challenge of coordinating **diaconal mercy** and **public justice** with the spirituality of the church. A fuller dogmatic statement drawing on **diaconal office**, **works of mercy**, and a thicker account of **general equity** in the **moral law** could answer worries of over-narrowness. Second, his method of pastoral exegesis, though robustly confessional, sometimes eschews the **scholastic precision** that would deepen arguments on, for example, **natural law**, **twofold kingdom**, and **creational ontology**, where **Van Tilian** insights into **antithesis** and **common grace** might sharpen cultural analyses. These are matters of extension rather than correction. The central gains of his work are substantial: a clear **biblical and confessional voice** against confusion, a charitable polemics that is firm without rancor, and a practical dogmatics that strengthens congregations in the **Reformed faith**.
