### TITLE
Thomas Aquinas offers a monumental synthesis of **Christian doctrine** and **Aristotelian philosophy** whose account of **nature and grace** both enriches and constrains later Reformed theology.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Thomas Aquinas** (1224 or 1225–1274) works in the **High Medieval** university setting of **Paris** and **Naples**, amid the rise of **Aristotelianism** and conflicts with **Averroism**.  
- His context is the consolidation of **scholastic** method after **Anselm** and **Peter Lombard**, and the mendicant reform of **Dominicans** and **Franciscans**.  

- Aquinas develops a highly structured **sacra doctrina** that is both **scientia** and **wisdom**, integrating **Scripture** and **reason** through an ordered, question-and-article method.  
- He affirms that **revelation** is necessary for salvific truths but that **natural reason** truly knows God as first cause, grounding a robust but controversial **natural theology**.  
- His epistemology combines **Augustinian** illumination with **Aristotelian** abstraction, yielding a careful doctrine of **analogy** in theological language.  

- The **Summa contra Gentiles** (c. 1259–1265) articulates a program of rational defense of **Christian theism** against **Islamic** and **Averroist** thought, especially on God and creation.  
- The **Summa Theologiae** (1265–1274) is his mature, unfinished synthesis of **doctrine**, covering **God**, **creation**, **Christ**, **sacraments**, and **last things** as one ordered **sacred science**.  
- His **Commentary on the Sentences** (c. 1252–1256) and **Biblical commentaries** on **Job**, **John**, and **Paul** show him as a dependent reader of **Lombard**, **Augustine**, and **Scripture**.  
- Works like **De Veritate** and **De Unitate Intellectus** refine his positions on **truth**, **intellect**, and **immortality** over against radical **Averroists**.  

- In **Trinitarian theology**, **Summa Theologiae I** offers a classically Nicene account of **divine simplicity**, **relations of origin**, and **processions**.  
- In **Christology and soteriology**, **Summa Theologiae III** develops a detailed account of the **incarnation**, **hypostatic union**, and **atonement** with a distinctive emphasis on **satisfaction**.  
- On **grace and nature**, Aquinas frames a lasting distinction between **natural** and **supernatural** ends, with heavy impact on debates about **justification**, **merit**, and **beatific vision**.  
- In **ethics and politics**, his doctrine of **natural law** and **virtue** shapes later **Roman Catholic** views of **culture**, **state**, and **common good**.  

- For a **Reformed** oral exam, you must affirm Aquinas on **classical theism** and **Trinity**, while clearly rejecting his **justification**, **merit**, and **sacramental** system.  
- A Westminster approach should read **Thomist** metaphysics critically yet appreciatively, using **Aquinas** both as an ally against modern **theological liberalism** and as a foil on **nature and grace**.  

- You should be ready to compare **Aquinas and Augustine** on **grace**, **will**, and **predestination** to show both continuity and divergence.  
- You should also contrast **Aquinas and Van Til** on **natural theology**, **analogy**, and the relation of **philosophy** to **revelation**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Thomas Aquinas, born near **Roccasecca** in 1224 or 1225 and dying at **Fossanova** in 1274, is formed at the intersection of **Benedictine** monastic culture and the new urban **scholastic** universities. Educated first at **Monte Cassino** and then at **Naples**, he enters the **Dominican** Order in 1244 under the influence of **Dominic** and the mendicant vision of preaching and study. He studies under **Albert the Great** in **Paris** and **Cologne**, absorbing the newly translated **Aristotle** and the Arabic commentators like **Avicenna** and **Averroes**. The driving pressure of his context is the need to integrate the influx of **Aristotelian** natural philosophy and metaphysics with **Christian doctrine**, against both **Averroist** dual-truth theories and anti-intellectual suspicions of philosophy.

The central theological problem Aquinas seeks to address is how **Christian faith** can be articulated as a unified **sacra doctrina** that is genuinely a **science** and yet grounded in **revelation**. In the **Summa Theologiae** he begins by asking whether **sacred doctrine** is a science and how it relates to **philosophy**, placing himself within but also reshaping the earlier **Lombardian** Sentences tradition. He faces the challenge of explaining how the transcendent, simple **God** of Christian confession can be known and spoken of through finite **concepts**, while also clarifying the relation of **grace** to **nature**, **supernatural beatitude** to **natural ends**, in a way that secures both the gratuity of salvation and the integrity of creation.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Aquinas understands **sacra doctrina** as a science that proceeds from **principles** given by **revelation**, received by **faith**, and handed down in **Scripture** and **tradition**. In **Summa Theologiae I.1** he states that this doctrine is taught by God and deals principally with God, yet also with all things in relation to God as their origin and end. **Scripture** has primacy as the inspired text, but **the Fathers**, especially **Augustine**, and the **magisterium** of the **church** function as authoritative interpreters. He takes the **creeds** and conciliar definitions like **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon** as normative summaries of biblical teaching. In this, there is broad continuity with later **Reformed** confessionalism, though Aquinas embeds this within a Roman ecclesiology and a notion of **tradition** that is more expansive than the Reformers would allow.

Reason plays a constitutive role in Aquinas. He distinguishes truths about God that are **preambles of faith**, knowable by **natural reason**, from mysteries that are knowable only by **revelation**. In **Summa contra Gentiles I** he defends the knowability by reason of God as first cause, simple, perfect, and provident. For him, **philosophy** is not an autonomous rival but a handmaiden to **theology**, clarifying concepts and supporting apologetic arguments. He adopts an **Aristotelian** theory of knowledge, in which the intellect knows through abstraction from sense experience, while still affirming an **Augustinian** account of divine illumination. This dual commitment grounds his doctrine of **analogy**: our language about God is neither univocal nor equivocal but **analogical**, as stated in **Summa Theologiae I.13**, because creatures participate in the divine perfections.

Aquinas views **history** not primarily as a process of development but as an ordered unfolding of divine **providence** toward the **beatific vision**. Nevertheless, he is deeply historical in his deference to **patristic** authorities and conciliar decisions. His extensive **Biblical commentaries** show him as a careful exegete, though his method is shaped by the fourfold **senses of Scripture** and the scholastic pursuit of **quaestiones** generated by the text. A Westminster examiner will note that his method grounds theology in **Scripture** and **churchly** reception while granting **reason** a positive but subordinated role, yet the Reformed will question the degree to which **natural theology** as Aquinas conceives it can be pursued apart from explicit **special revelation**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

Classical theism baseline: God is simple, immutable, omniscient, omnipotent, and triune, as confessed by **Nicaea**, **Constantinople**, and developed by **Augustine**. Aquinas in **Summa Theologiae I.2–26** offers one of the most rigorous accounts of **divine simplicity**, arguing that in God essence and existence are identical, that God is pure act without any potency, and that all divine attributes are really identical with the divine essence. He mounts the famous **Five Ways** to show the existence of God as unmoved mover, first cause, necessary being, maximal being, and governing intelligence, drawing from **Aristotle** yet directing them toward the Christian God. On the **Trinity**, in **Summa Theologiae I.27–43**, he upholds the Nicene faith against **Arian** and **Sabellian** errors, structuring the doctrine around **processions** and **relations of origin**, so that the personal distinctions are real relations within the one simple essence. His interlocutors include **Boethius** and **Peter Lombard**, and his account deeply shapes later **Reformed scholastics** like **Turretin**, though Reformed theologians will qualify his appropriation of **Aristotelian** categories and insist that his natural proofs cannot be divorced from the noetic effects of **sin**.

On **Christology** and **atonement**, the confessional baseline is **Chalcedon**: one person in two natures, without confusion, change, division, or separation, and a substitutionary, priestly work for sin. In **Summa Theologiae III.1–26** Aquinas explicates the **incarnation** with precision, asserting the unity of the person of the **Word** and the integrity of both divine and human natures. He engages **Nestorian** and **Monophysite** errors and leans heavily on **Leo the Great** and **John of Damascus**. In **Summa Theologiae III.46–49** his doctrine of **atonement** is classically Augustinian but with a distinct emphasis on **satisfaction**: Christ offers to God a superabundant satisfaction on behalf of sinners, which, given the dignity of his divine person, suffices for the sins of the world. He insists that God could have forgiven sins otherwise, yet chose satisfaction as a fitting mode that manifests justice and mercy. While this has important overlaps with later Reformed **penal substitution**, the Reformed will insist more explicitly on the **forensic** and penal dimension, whereas Aquinas tends to integrate satisfaction, merit, and the infusion of **charity** within a broader sacramental economy.

In the locus of **grace, nature, and justification**, the Reformed confessional baseline is that fallen humans are totally unable to do any spiritual good, that justification is by **faith alone** through the imputed righteousness of Christ, and that grace is sovereign and monergistic. Aquinas in **Summa Theologiae I–II and II–II** distinguishes carefully between **nature** and **grace**, **natural ends** and **supernatural beatitude**. In his view, human nature is ordered to a proportionate natural good, yet God has freely elevated humanity to the **supernatural** end of the **beatific vision**, which exceeds all natural capacity. Sin wounds but does not annihilate nature, leaving a capacity for certain natural virtues. In **Summa Theologiae I–II.109–114** he teaches that **grace** is necessary for any meritorious act ordered to eternal life, that grace heals and elevates the will, and that justification involves the infusion of **habitual grace** and **charity**, the forgiveness of sins, and the interior renewal of the person. He opposes **Pelagian** and semi-Pelagian tendencies and affirms predestination in **Summa Theologiae I.23**. Yet his doctrine of **merit** and the intrinsic righteousness of the justified stands in sharp contrast to **Calvin** and the **Reformed confessions**, which deny condign merit and insist that justification is purely forensic on the basis of an imputed alien righteousness.

In the realms of **church, sacraments, and culture**, the classic baseline in Reformed thought is that Christ mediates grace by his Spirit through **Word and sacrament**, that the visible church is marked by pure preaching and right administration of the sacraments, and that common grace sustains cultural life. Aquinas develops a robust **sacramental** theology in **Summa Theologiae III.60–83**, where sacraments are instrumental causes of grace, signs that confer what they signify by divine institution. He affirms the **real presence** of Christ in the **Eucharist** through **transubstantiation**, defending this against **Berengarian** trajectories, and he articulates a sevenfold sacramental system later codified at **Trent**. In his **commentary on Romans** he expounds the church as a visible, hierarchical body under the **papacy**, with the sacramental and juridical means of salvation entrusted to it. On **culture and politics**, in works like **De Regno** and **Summa Theologiae I–II.90–97**, he articulates a doctrine of **natural law** and a hierarchical ordering of temporal to spiritual ends. His interlocutors include **Augustine** on the two cities and **Aristotle** on politics. Reformed thinkers will appropriate his notion of natural law and common good in modified form, yet will strongly contest his sacramentalism and Roman ecclesiology.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians receive **Aquinas** with a mixture of deep respect and sharp critique. **Calvin** rarely cites him but stands within the broader Augustinian opposition to any doctrine of **free will** and **merit** that compromises sola gratia and sola fide. **Turretin** and the Reformed **scholastics** make extensive use of Thomist arguments on **divine attributes**, **simplicity**, and **providence**, often quoting or summarizing his positions on **God**, **creation**, and **Trinity** while explicitly rejecting Thomist positions on **justification**, **merit**, and **sacraments**. **Bavinck** praises the clarity and depth of Aquinas on **natural and supernatural revelation**, **Trinity**, and **Christology**, yet criticizes the nature and grace scheme for opening the door to a dualism between the natural and the supernatural orders.

In the twentieth century, **Van Til** becomes the most pointed Reformed critic of **Thomism**, especially of its **natural theology** and doctrine of the *analogia entis*. Van Til argues that Aquinas grants too much autonomy to **natural reason**, underestimates the **noetic effects of sin**, and fails to think consistently from the principial authority of **Scripture** and the self-attesting **Triune God**. From a Westminster perspective, key non-negotiable objections include Aquinas on **justification** as involving infused righteousness and merit, and his **sacramental** view of grace as ex opere operato in the sevenfold system. Another objection concerns any reading of **analogy** or **natural law** that would imply a neutral or autonomous realm of natural knowledge independent of **special revelation**.

At the same time, Reformed theologians can and do learn much from Aquinas. His rigorous articulation of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **attributes** offers a grammar that the Reformed confessions implicitly assume. His insistence that **theology** is a unified science governed by **revelation**, and his refusal to oppose faith and reason, provides a model against modern **fideism** and **rationalism** alike. His careful account of **virtue**, **law**, and the **common good** furnishes conceptual tools for Reformed reflection on **ethics** and **culture**, provided that these tools are recast within a robust doctrine of **common grace** and the antithesis between belief and unbelief.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, safe opening sentences would stress Aquinas as a **Christian theologian** rather than simply a philosopher. For example, you might say: Thomas Aquinas is a thirteenth century **Dominican** who offers one of the most influential syntheses of **Augustinian theology** and **Aristotelian philosophy**, aiming to articulate *sacra doctrina* as a unified science grounded in **revelation**. Another safe line is: Reformed orthodoxy both appropriates Aquinas on **classical theism** and emphatically rejects his **doctrine of justification** and **sacraments**. These openings show that you recognize his magnitude yet maintain clear Reformed boundaries.

You must handle certain phrases with care. The term *analogia entis* is a landmine; do not endorse it flatly. Better to say: Aquinas develops an **analogical** doctrine of God language in **Summa Theologiae I.13**, which later Roman Catholic theology frames as the *analogia entis*, but from a Reformed and especially **Van Tilian** standpoint this must be critically assessed in light of the Creator creature distinction and the comprehensive effects of **sin**. Similarly, the phrase **natural theology** needs qualification. You should affirm that Aquinas is right that **Romans 1** teaches a natural knowledge of God, yet insist that in a fallen world this knowledge is always distorted without **saving revelation** and the **regenerating** work of the Spirit. Avoid saying that Aquinas offers a fully **Augustinian** doctrine of grace without qualification; instead, say that he is deeply Augustinian on **predestination** and the necessity of grace but that his system, especially on **merit** and **justification**, is modified in a way the Reformers reject.

Students are often tripped up by two misunderstandings. One is to treat Aquinas as simply a rationalist philosopher who ignores **Scripture**. Examiners can quickly expose this by asking about his **Biblical commentaries** or his use of **Augustine** and the **Fathers**. You should be ready to acknowledge that Aquinas is fundamentally a **Biblical** and ecclesial theologian, though his exegesis is shaped by medieval hermeneutics and dominated by **Aristotelian** categories. The other misunderstanding is to assume that Aquinas teaches **Pelagianism** or denies **predestination**. In reality, he clearly affirms predestination in **Summa Theologiae I.23** and insists that grace is necessary for any act ordered to **eternal life**. The Reformed critique is more nuanced: he so structures the **nature grace** relation and the doctrine of **merit** that the absolute gratuity of justification by **faith alone** is compromised. Examiners may also press on whether Reformed writers have unfairly caricatured Aquinas; you should respond by admitting genuine continuities with **Reformed scholasticism** on **God** and **Trinity**, while reaffirming the decisive break on **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Thomas Aquinas should be honored as a major doctor of the **church** whose trinitarian **classical theism**, high view of **providence**, and insistence that theology is grounded in **revelation** provide enduring resources, yet his *nature grace* schema, his strong **natural theology**, and especially his doctrine of **justification**, **merit**, and **sacramental grace** must be rejected as incompatible with the **Reformed confessions**; so if asked where you land, you should say that a confessional Reformed theologian may gratefully appropriate Thomist insights on **God**, **creation**, and **virtue** within a Van Tilian critique of autonomous reason, but must decisively stand with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** against Aquinas on **justification by faith alone**, the sufficiency and supremacy of **Scripture**, and the absolute dependence of all true knowledge of God on the self-attesting **Triune Lord** revealed in **Christ**.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Thomas Aquinas is a thirteenth century **Dominican** who offers a monumental synthesis of **Augustinian theology** and **Aristotelian philosophy** that profoundly shapes Western **doctrine**.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born c. 1224–1225 near **Roccasecca**, studies in **Naples**, **Paris**, and **Cologne**, and dies in 1274 on the way to the **Council of Lyons**.  
- The **Summa contra Gentiles** (c. 1259–1265) defends **Christian theism** philosophically against **Averroism** and non Christian thought.  
- The **Summa Theologiae** (1265–1274) is his unfinished masterwork in **sacra doctrina**, covering God, **creation**, **Christ**, **sacraments**, and **eschatology**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Aquinas sees **theology** as *sacra doctrina*, a **science** that proceeds from principles of **revelation** given in **Scripture** and taught by the **church**.  
- He assigns a positive but subordinate role to **reason** and **philosophy**, affirming a real **natural knowledge** of God while distinguishing it from the mysteries known only by **faith**.  
- His doctrine of **analogy** in **Summa Theologiae I.13** holds that our language about God is neither univocal nor equivocal but **analogical**, grounded in creaturely participation in divine perfections.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **God** he defends **divine simplicity**, pure actuality, and the **Five Ways** as rational demonstrations of the existence and attributes of the Christian God.  
- On the **Trinity** he develops a relational account of **processions** and **persons** within the one simple essence, in continuity with **Augustine** and **Nicaea**.  
- On **Christ** he upholds **Chalcedonian** two natures in one person and articulates a **satisfaction** account of **atonement** in **Summa Theologiae III.46–49**.  
- On **grace and nature** he distinguishes natural and supernatural ends, positing **habitual grace** and **charity** as infused habits that heal and elevate the will toward the **beatific vision**.  
- On **church and sacraments** he teaches seven **sacraments** as instrumental causes of grace and affirms **transubstantiation** and a hierarchical **Roman** ecclesiology.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster theology rejects Aquinas on **justification**, since he locates it in infused **habitual grace** and **merit** rather than the imputed righteousness of Christ received by **faith alone**.  
- Reformed thinkers criticize his strong **natural theology** and *analogia entis* as granting too much autonomy to **reason** and underestimating the noetic effects of **sin**.  
- His **sacramental** system, especially **transubstantiation** and ex opere operato efficacy, conflicts with Reformed doctrine of **Word and sacrament** as means of grace.  
- His **nature grace** schema and dual ordering of ends raise concerns about a split between **natural** and **supernatural** that Reformed **common grace** and covenant theology seek to avoid.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Aquinas vs Augustine** on **grace** and **predestination** contrasts a more structured nature grace scheme with a more radical emphasis on original sin and sovereign grace.  
- **Aquinas vs Calvin** on **justification** contrasts infused **habitual righteousness** and merit with purely forensic **imputed righteousness** by faith alone.  
- **Aquinas vs Van Til** on **natural theology** contrasts scholastic confidence in natural reason with a presuppositional insistence on the principial authority of **special revelation**.  
- **Aquinas vs Barth** on **analogy** contrasts the *analogia entis* and natural knowledge of God with the **analogia fidei** and a more exclusive focus on **revelation in Christ**.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Thomas Aquinas is a crucial ally for the **Reformed** on **classical theism** and a decisive opponent on **justification**, **sacraments**, and the autonomy of **natural reason**, so he must be mined carefully and critiqued firmly.
