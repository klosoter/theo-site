### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Steve Gregg emerged in the closing decades of the twentieth century as a broadly **evangelical** Bible teacher in the independent-church and missions-rich ecosystem of the American West, best known for the daily call-in program **The Narrow Path** that has aired since the late 1990s. Situated in the wake of the Jesus Movement, his formation reflects a free-church piety that prizes **sola Scriptura**, public Bible reading, and lay-accessible catechesis. He taught in informal Bible school networks and missions contexts, and his classroom gradually moved onto radio and the internet. Theologically, Gregg is a conservative trinitarian who confesses **Nicene** orthodoxy, yet he resists hard confessional boundaries beyond shared creed. His signature contribution is a comparative method that places multiple **doctrinal views** side by side under the light of Scripture, a habit shaped by the conviction that disputed loci require patience, full hearing of alternatives, and tested exegesis rather than polemical fiat.

Gregg’s epistemic stance can be described as an irenic **comparative evangelicalism**. He operates with a **historical-grammatical hermeneutic** and a pastoral version of the *analogia fidei* that reads difficult texts in the unity of canonical testimony. He is skeptical of systems that preempt exegesis and thus prefers to display options, weigh their textual warrants, and then press the conscience toward responsible fidelity. The result is a pedagogy that foregrounds **Scripture** over party and emphasizes the spiritual virtues of humility and teachability in doctrinal judgment.

#### 2. Revelation and the art of parallel commentary
Gregg’s most influential work, **Revelation: Four Views** first published in 1997 and substantially revised in 2013, is a parallel commentary that places **preterist, historicist, futurist, and idealist** interpretations in adjacent columns. The apparatus functions like a patristic catena, curating voices rather than dictating conclusions. He cites ancient and modern interpreters across the spectrum, from **Victorinus** and **Augustine** to **E. B. Elliott**, **William Hendriksen**, **George Eldon Ladd**, **Robert Mounce**, **Kenneth Gentry**, and contemporary evangelical expositors. The genre is itself a methodological thesis: contested apocalyptic texts demand disciplined reasoning that hears the church across ages and traditions.

The volume’s constructive aim is both ecclesial and hermeneutical. Ecclesially, it lowers the temperature in intramural conflicts among **dispensational futurists**, **partial preterists**, and **amillennial idealists** by showing that each approach seeks to honor **biblical authority**. Hermeneutically, it urges criteria for adjudication, such as textual coherence, first-century context, symbolic density, Old Testament intertextuality, and Christological focus. Gregg’s own sympathies lean toward **partial preterism** and a non-speculative **amillennial** or modest **postmillennial** horizon, yet the apparatus is built to protect readers from the excesses of **newspaper eschatology** and the vulnerabilities of **full preterism**. He frequently entertains an early, Neronian date for Revelation and emphasizes Rome’s first-century oppression, while also acknowledging the enduring patterns of imperial idolatry that feed **idealism**.

#### 3. Kingdom-centered eschatology and public discipleship
The two-volume **Empire of the Risen Son** published 2020–2021 distills Gregg’s mature eschatology around the **kingdom of God** as the controlling biblical motif. Here he rehearses the already and truly present reign of the risen Jesus, integrating prophetic expectation, Gospel proclamation, and apostolic moral vision. His project challenges privatized **soteriology** by reasserting discipleship under Christ’s kingship, with sustained attention to the **Sermon on the Mount**, the parables of the **kingdom**, and the political witness of the church as a transnational polis. He argues that the kingdom reconfigures ethics, economics, and allegiance, pushing back against civil-religious fusions and against speculative **premillennial dispensationalism** that defers obedience to a future epoch.

Within this kingdom frame, Gregg practices a **redemptive-historical** reading without strict confessional coding. He foregrounds the prophetic echoes in Revelation, the Exodus imagery, and Danielic patterns, thereby strengthening the case for **idealism** as a perpetual grammar of persecution and perseverance. He is wary of **Christian nationalism**, not by constructing a doctrine of two kingdoms, but by calling believers to embody cruciform fidelity in a rival empire. The result is a public theology that retrieves classic evangelical **discipleship** and situates it within an inaugurated eschatology shaped by the crucified and enthroned Lord.

#### 4. Hell, judgment, and the bounds of evangelical disputation
In **All You Want to Know About Hell** published 2013, Gregg applies his comparative method to the doctrine of final judgment. He frames the **status controversiae** among **eternal conscious torment**, **conditional immortality** or **annihilationism**, and **universal reconciliation**, treating each with full scriptural argumentation, historical witnesses, and analytic clarification. He probes lexical matters such as *aionios*, the topography of **Gehenna** and **Hades**, and the intertextual freight of Isaiah and Revelation, while also canvassing patristic and evangelical advocates, including figures like **Edward Fudge** for annihilationism and contemporary defenders of **ECT**.

Gregg’s personal posture is studiously non-dogmatic at the level of confessional decree, though he often highlights the ethical and exegetical instincts that recommend **conditional immortality**, such as the stress on death as wages of sin and numerous texts promising destruction rather than endless torment. Yet he refuses to anathematize proponents of **ECT** and warns against hasty acceptance of **universalism**. The upshot is both pedagogical and ecclesial. Pedagogically, he equips readers to test arguments by Scripture. Ecclesially, he models a way of handling hot-button doctrines without sacrificing **orthodoxy** or charity.

#### 5. Soteriology and the contest over grace and freedom
On salvation, Gregg represents a classically **Arminian** or non-Calvinist evangelical pattern. He affirms the primacy of grace and the necessity of **regeneration**, but he rejects **unconditional election**, **irresistible grace**, and **limited atonement** in favor of **synergism**, universal provision in the cross, and **resistible grace**. He treats the warnings of Hebrews, Paul’s exhortations, and Jesus’ vine discourse as genuine cautions against **apostasy**, advocating **conditional security** rather than automatic perseverance. His radio debates and lectures labor to show that the **TULIP** scheme, while internally coherent, places a prior dogmatic grid upon texts that should be read with lexical, literary, and covenantal sensitivity.

Gregg engages the Augustinian tradition by distinguishing between **Pelagian** error and synergistic orthodoxy, and he often appeals to the early church’s soteriological instincts amid baptism, catechesis, and penitential discipline. His reading of Romans 9–11 and Johannine data stresses corporate **election** in Christ, the openness of the gospel call, and the moral seriousness of perseverance. He argues that evangelical assurance remains Christ-centered while refusing to cancel warnings that function as means of grace. In all of this, Gregg insists that **Scripture** not system decide the final shape of doctrinal proportion.

#### 6. Scripture, church, and the pedagogy of conscience
Gregg’s ministry assumes the primacy of **Scripture** but practices it in a distinctively didactic format. Rather than declaring a synthetic system in advance, he teaches by laying out canonical data sets and tracking how different **traditions** weigh the material. This pedagogy forms conscience by exercising judgment on live exegetical disputes. It mirrors the older catena approach in which voices from across time are brought into conversation, though in Gregg’s case the range includes patristic commentaries, **Reformation** expositors, and modern evangelical scholars. He cites **Matthew Henry** and **John Wesley** alongside twentieth-century voices, not as authorities over **sola Scriptura** but as exemplars of interpretive possibility.

This approach yields a certain ecclesiology. Gregg views the church as a communion bound by the creed and by shared obedience to the **kingdom** rather than by exhaustive confessional alignments. He exhorts Christians to gather, serve, and bear witness, often warning against denominational partisanship that eclipses Christ’s agenda. The tension in his project is deliberate. He wants biblically serious learners who recognize that on matters like **millennial** timing, final punishment, and the ordo salutis, the household of faith encompasses varieties that should be weighed rather than caricatured.

#### 7. Apocalyptic sobriety and critique of speculative systems
The polemical edge in Gregg’s work is most evident in his critiques of **dispensationalism** and **full preterism**. Against the former, he catalogs the exegetical hazards of splitting Israel and the church, multiplying comings of Christ, and reading newspapers into **apocalyptic** texts. Against the latter, he argues that collapsing the future bodily return and resurrection into the first-century crisis violates the creedal hope and misreads the eschatological horizons of the **New Testament**. His solution is neither historicist confidence in exact timetables nor escapist futurism, but a thick intertextual reading that honors first-century referents and enduring symbolic archetypes, a blend that engages **idealism** and **partial preterism** within a **Christocentric** frame.

This sobriety extends to pastoral counsel. Gregg warns that speculative **prophecy** schemes often breed fear, credulity, and spiritual distraction. He calls believers to the patient virtues of faith, hope, and love under the **lordship of Christ**, framing the Apocalypse as a discipleship manual for suffering saints rather than a codebook for geopolitical forecasting. The church’s calling is worship, witness, and endurance in the present reign of Jesus, which reorients eschatology from curiosity to **holiness**.

#### 8. Style, reception, and influence
Gregg’s style is marked by logical clarity, generous citation, and transparent **argument mapping**. He often restates an opponent’s case with more care than the opponent shows, a virtue that has earned him trust across camps. Pastors and lay teachers use **Revelation: Four Views** because it hands them the debate without dictation and because it anchors claims in primary sources. The **The Narrow Path** archive, with verse-by-verse lectures across the canon, extends this pedagogical reach, building a free library of biblical instruction that treats ordinary Christians as capable theologians.

Reception has varied. Broad **evangelicals** have appreciated the charity and clarity. Proponents of **full preterism** have found in him a formidable critic. Some conservatives worry that comparative method without confessional prioritization breeds indecision. Others note that by reopening the doctrine of **hell** and by defending **conditional security**, Gregg situates himself in ongoing evangelical disputes that require doctrinal firmness. Even so, his influence as a curator of the conversation and as an advocate of serious Bible reading is secure.

#### 9. Doctrinal profile in the contemporary landscape
Across loci, Gregg’s doctrinal profile is coherent. He is a Nicene **Trinitarian**, an orthodox **Christologist**, and a champion of the **kingdom of God** as the Bible’s integrative theme. His **soteriology** is Arminian with strong attention to perseverance through faith. His **ecclesiology** stresses lived obedience over institutional perfection. His **eschatology** is inaugurated and non-speculative, with a strong **partial preterist** and **ideal** reading of apocalyptic texts, and with hope fixed on the visible **parousia** and bodily resurrection. His moral theology is evangelical, emphasizing the **Sermon on the Mount** and radical discipleship in daily work and neighbor love.

The theological impulses that tie this together are two. First, a commitment to **biblical catholicity**, the conviction that the truth can be heard in multiple accents where Scripture rules. Second, a pedagogy of conscience that forms people to read well and argue well for the sake of unity and mission. These impulses render his work a serviceable map of contested terrain and a call to live under the Word.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Gregg’s project offers both salutary correctives and significant tensions. Positively, his critique of **dispensationalism**, his resistance to **full preterism**, his Christ-centered and **amillennial**-friendly reading of apocalyptic imagery, and his emphasis on the **kingdom of God** align with a **redemptive-historical** hermeneutic that prizes typology, covenantal unity, and Christ as the center of Scripture. His call to handle **Revelation** with intertextual sobriety and pastoral purpose resonates with the **Westminster Confession** on Scripture’s clarity in things necessary and on the sufficiency of the canon. However, the comparative method as he employs it can, at points, displace confessional normativity with procedural neutrality, blurring the principial claims of **covenant theology** and the confessional stakes of **particular redemption**, **effectual calling**, and the **perseverance of the saints**. Reopening the doctrine of **hell** to include **annihilationism** as a live option sits uncomfortably with **WCF 32–33**, which teach the souls of the wicked are cast into hell and reserved to the day of judgment, then consigned to everlasting torments, and likewise his advocacy of **conditional security** conflicts with the Reformed doctrine that the elect infallibly persevere by God’s immutable decree and preserving grace. A Reformed alternative would receive his kingdom-centric exegesis, his anti-speculative eschatology, and his pastoral patience, yet it would bind them within a thicker **covenantal** frame where election, atonement, and perseverance are anchored in the triune decree, where **ordinary means of grace** shape discipleship, and where the church’s confessional voice guides disputation so that *sola Scriptura* is practiced as confessional Scripture, not as a rotating forum of options. In short, Gregg’s comparative clarity is a gift, but the Reformed tradition would insist that clarity be ordered toward confessional conviction in the service of the church’s doxology and mission.
