### ESSAY
Luciano Floridi, born in 1964, emerged as the foremost architect of a contemporary **philosophy of information** as digital technologies transformed late modern life. Working in Italy and the United Kingdom, including long service at the **University of Oxford** and the **Alan Turing Institute**, he shaped both academic inquiry and public policy in the ethics of AI and data. His project responds to the consolidation of a global **infosphere** where computation, networking, and datafication reconfigure social, economic, and epistemic structures. Against an older instrumental picture of tools and users, Floridi claims that digital technologies alter the very furniture of reality, hence they demand a first philosophy. Across monographs from **Information: A Very Short Introduction** 2010 to **The Logic of Information** 2019 and **The Green and the Blue** 2023, he develops an ambitious synthesis spanning **analytic metaphysics**, **epistemology**, and **applied ethics**, guided by the conviction that our age requires a unified framework of **informational structural realism** and **information ethics**.

The methodological center of Floridi’s work is his articulation of **Levels of Abstraction**, a disciplined way of modeling phenomena by fixing the relevant observables and their granularity. Instead of seeking a view from nowhere, he argues that meaningful discourse always operates at a chosen **LoA** with its own predicates, metrics, and constraints. This method preserves rigor while acknowledging the plural architectures of inquiry in physics, biology, cognitive science, and social analysis. It also anchors his account of **semantic information**. Departing from **Shannon’s** treatment of information as syntactic signal measured by entropy, Floridi defines semantic information as data that are well formed, meaningful, and true. In his now-classic formula from **The Philosophy of Information** 2011, false semantic content is not information but misinformation, a normative line that ties content to **truth**, not merely to transmission. This required a careful theory of **data** as relational differences, a diaphoric account that marks data as structured lack of uniformity within a domain fixed by a Level of Abstraction.

From this methodology Floridi advances **informational structural realism**, a metaphysical thesis about what there is. Updating scientific **structural realism**, he contends that the world is composed of informational structures and their relations, not of unknowable things-in-themselves. The fundamental is not a hidden substance but the network of constraints, regularities, and patterns that can be modeled as information across LoAs. In conversation with **Wheeler’s** slogan it from bit and against naive digital idealism, Floridi rejects reductionism to bits or to computation tout court. The reality of electrons or organisms is not illusion but structure, intelligible through **informational patterns** and capacities within a given system. This ontological stance sets the stage for his practical turn, since it implies that agency, organisms, artifacts, and institutions all instantiate and transform the **infosphere** as a shared environment of informational beings.

In **The Fourth Revolution** 2014 Floridi narrates a genealogy of human self-understanding through four displacements. Following **Copernicus**, **Darwin**, and **Freud**, the fourth revolution, associated with **Turing**, decenters the human from the privileged locus of intelligent processing. We are **inforgs**, informational organisms embedded in and mutually constitutive of the **infosphere**, not sovereign minds observing a separate digital world. He coins the term **onlife** to name the erasure of the boundary between online and offline existence, where identity, labor, and civic life are hybridized by pervasive computation. This anthropology reframes familiar questions about **personhood**, **agency**, and **community**. If the self is an informationally sustained pattern across media and institutions, then questions about continuity, memory, and responsibility receive new contours. Thus the fourth revolution is not a slogan about gadgets but a claim about the **metaphysics of presence**, the **political economy of platforms**, and the **social ontology** of networked publics.

Ethically Floridi proposes a shift from traditional microethics to a macroethics of the **infosphere**, articulated in **The Ethics of Information** 2013. At its core is a patient-oriented stance that ascribes moral value to informational entities as such. His key thesis is that the flourishing of informational beings, including biological organisms, social institutions, and some artefacts, is a primary good, while **entropy**, understood as corruption and destruction of informational structures, is a primary evil. This leads to a deontic orientation that constrains agents to minimize entropy and enhance the resilience of the infosphere. He advances **distributed morality**, where agency is networked across humans and artifacts, and outcomes emerge from socio-technical systems rather than isolated wills. To enable such systems he introduces **infraethics**, the normative infrastructure, such as standards and protocols, that makes cooperative behavior possible before explicit moral choices are even posed. The result is an ethics that is ecologically attuned to information environments and sensitive to design, regulation, and governance.

Privacy and governance are central test cases. Floridi’s influential notion of **ontological friction** defines privacy as the modulation of informational flow made possible by the resistance present in a given environment. As digital systems reduce friction through searchability, linkability, and persistence, privacy must be rearticulated as control over the dynamics of dissemination, not as secrecy. He argues for **group privacy**, a category that protects collectives subject to profiling and inference even when no individual datum appears sensitive, an idea developed in collaborative work such as **Group Privacy** 2017. In the domain of AI he helped articulate five principles for a trustworthy ecosystem, the **AI4People** framework, namely beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, justice, and **explicability**, where explicability names the dual demands of intelligibility and accountability. Through advisory roles to the **European Commission** and the **Alan Turing Institute**, these theoretical moves became operational in policy on **data governance**, **algorithmic transparency**, and **digital sovereignty**.

The mature articulation of method arrives in **The Logic of Information** 2019, where Floridi presents philosophy as **conceptual design**. Here metaphilosophy itself is treated as an informational practice that engineers tools for understanding rather than merely describing the given. The book integrates **Levels of Abstraction**, model theory, and a measured constructivism that echoes **Kant** without reintroducing a noumenal realm. Knowledge is secured as reliable construction constrained by the world’s informational structure. He insists that truth remains the norm for **semantic information**, even while method is design oriented. This offers surprising traction for theological concerns about **testimony**, **revelation**, and **language**, since it places norm-governed content at the core of communication and resists reducing meaning to correlation. It also provides a vocabulary to distinguish **signal** from **sense**, a feature too often collapsed in popular data science discourse.

Floridi’s interlocutions refine the boundaries of his claims. Against **Shannon** he insists that syntax without semantics cannot ground truth; against **Dretske** he modifies the link between information and indication to guard the veridicality of semantic content. In reply to **Wheeler** he denies that physics is literally made of bits, proposing instead an **informational structural realism** that does not erase ontology into measurement. In contrast to **Heidegger’s** critique of modern **Gestell**, Floridi reframes technology less as enframing revelation of beings and more as the evolving architecture of the **infosphere**, though he shares the sense that technology reconfigures world disclosure. His disputes with **Latourian** actor-network theory clarify that while artifacts participate in **distributed morality**, not all participations are equivalent, and governance must still evaluate structures by ethical criteria like **justice** and **explicability**. These engagements disclose a project that is analytic in method yet responsive to continental insights about worldhood and mediation.

The theological implications emerge from his ontological and ethical theses. The **infosphere** as a created environment resonantly parallels Christian accounts of an ordered **cosmos** upheld by **divine wisdom**, while **informational structures** suggest a grammar of creaturely forms and relations that theology often names **logoi** or **rationes seminales**. Floridi’s insistence that **semantic information** is truth-apt invites fruitful dialogue with doctrines of **revelation as divine speech**, the **verbum Dei** that generates and governs creation. One might redescribe the **imago Dei** as a vocation to be faithful stewards of the **informational ecology** through truthful communication, just institutions, and restorative design that resists **entropy**. His **onlife** analysis sharpens ecclesial practice by clarifying how **sacramentality**, catechesis, and pastoral oversight unfold within hybrid environments of presence and mediation. Even his category of **infraethics** can assist theologians who seek to inhabit spaces where tacit norms shape agency before explicit moralizing, a case that parallels liturgical formation and **habitus**.

The limits of the system also guide theological caution. **Informational structural realism** is a philosophically modest ontological claim, yet it risks a metaphysical levelling of being into structure that cannot account for **creation ex nihilo**, **divine simplicity**, or the asymmetry of **Creator and creature** if it is taken as exhaustive. The move to include artifacts among **moral patients** is ethically generative at the level of system design, yet it can obscure the uniqueness of **human personhood**, responsibility, and the **imago Dei** when transposed without remainder. Defining **semantic information** by truthfulness yields analytic clarity, but it can underestimate the theological density of **false witness**, **deception**, and **idolatry** as realities that parasitically occupy the same communicative space as truth, not mere nullities. Finally, the project’s **constructionist** tone, though disciplined by LoAs and constrained by reality, tends to cast salvation as informational resilience against **entropy**, a diagnosis helpful for policy yet thin with respect to **sin**, **grace**, and **reconciliation**.

A Reformed and WTS evaluation can therefore affirm much while sharply distinguishing nature and grace. Under the rubric of **common grace**, Floridi’s **Levels of Abstraction**, **semantic information**, and **explicability** offer powerful tools for creaturely wisdom, aiding dominion in the **cultural mandate** and clarifying the creational goodness of an ordered **informational cosmos**. Yet classical Reformed commitments to **creator-creature distinction**, the **noetic effects of sin**, and the primacy of **special revelation** require critique of any move that would ontologize reality solely as **informational structure** or dilute **imago Dei** into generic **inforgs**. A covenantal epistemology, anchored in **Scripture as divine speech** and governed by **law and gospel**, locates truth not only in veridical content but in a personal **Word** who addresses and judges. Where **distributed morality** disperses agency, Reformed thought retrieves **federal headship**, **sphere sovereignty**, and **ordered responsibility** to resist the evacuation of personal accountability. The better alternative is principled appropriation: receive **privacy as ontological friction**, **group privacy**, and **infraethics** as prudential insights for public justice; reframe **entropy** under the doctrines of **fall** and **providence**; and confess that the **infosphere** is a good but penultimate economy sustained by the **Triune God**, whose **revelation** grounds both our semantic norm of truth and our hope for the restoration of all things.
