### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
J. Denny Weaver emerged as a leading **Mennonite Anabaptist** voice in late twentieth-century North America, articulating a distinctively **peace church** soteriology within the broader ecosystem of **contemporary theology**. Teaching for decades at Bluffton University in Ohio, a historic Mennonite institution, Weaver formed his work in the lived debates of pacifist communities wrestling with **state violence**, **war**, and **criminal justice**. The Mennonite heritage of **discipleship**, **believers baptism**, and **church discipline** supplied the ecclesial grammar, while the social ferment of civil rights, post-Vietnam, and post-Cold War reconfigurations pressed the question of whether **God** can be confessed as **nonviolent** without remainder. His theological voice matured in conversation with the **Anabaptist tradition** of **Menno Simons** and **Pilgram Marpeck**, the modern political ecclesiology of **John Howard Yoder**, and the atonement realignment proposed by **Gustaf Aulén**. In that crucible Weaver adopted a method that is narrative, praxis-oriented, and hermeneutically christocentric, deploying a **Jesus-centered reading of Scripture** where the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus, especially the **Sermon on the Mount**, function as the canon within the canon.

Weaver’s method is best described as an **Anabaptist narrative theology**. He resists a scholastic layering of natural theology and metaphysical attributes, preferring the storied revelation of **God in Jesus**. That preference yields an epistemic stance where theology is disciplined by **ecclesial practice**: the community that refuses **violence** must speak of God in a way that sustains that refusal. This is not mere ethics appended to doctrine. Rather, in Weaver’s construal, **soteriology** and **ethics** are one narrative, the saving reign of God made visible in a community of enemy-love. His appeal to **womanist and feminist critiques** of atonement violence exhibits an additional methodological note, a critical retrieval shaped by the lived experiences of oppressed bodies. Thus the theological laboratory is both exegetical and communal, run by a peace church reading Scripture with those for whom violent theologies have sacralized suffering.

#### 2. Becoming Anabaptist and postmodern engagements
Weaver’s early synthesis appears in **Becoming Anabaptist** 1987, revised 2005, which offers historical orientation and contemporary significance for **sixteenth-century Anabaptism**. There he identifies the signal features of the **radical Reformation** that animate his later doctrinal moves: the primacy of **discipleship**, a **nonviolent church** distinct from the **magisterial Reformation**, and an ecclesiology where **baptism** binds the believer to a disciplined body. These commitments come to explicit doctrinal expression in **Anabaptist Theology in Face of Postmodernity** 2003. In that book Weaver navigates the postmodern critique of metanarratives by proposing a particular, concrete **Jesus-story** as the community’s narrative. He resists relativism by anchoring truth in the performative witness of the church that lives **enemy love** and **nonretaliation**, thereby refiguring apologetics as visible **praxis** rather than argumentative force. The postmodern moment, for Weaver, is neither an intellectual catastrophe nor a panacea. It is an opportunity to affirm the plurality of voices, especially **womanist** and **Black** theologies, while insisting that the **nonviolent reign of God** discerned in the Gospels provides the criterion that orders plurality.

This methodological and historical platform sets the stage for Weaver’s central contribution. The Anabaptist memory of church as a **contrast-society** and the postmodern insight into narrative performance combine to yield a soteriology in which the cross and resurrection are not metaphysical transactions but a plot movement in God’s peaceful victory. The category shift from theory to story will govern his most influential doctrinal proposals.

#### 3. The Nonviolent Atonement and narrative Christus Victor
Weaver’s signature argument appears in **The Nonviolent Atonement** 2001, second edition 2011, where he advances **narrative Christus Victor** as the controlling soteriological lens. Drawing on **Gustaf Aulén’s** retrieval of patristic themes of victory over **Satan** and **death**, Weaver argues that traditional Western models of atonement, especially **Anselm’s satisfaction** and **penal substitution** as developed by **Calvin**, rely on depictions of **divine justice** that sanction violence. In his judgment, these models construe the Father as demanding the violent death of the Son or as constrained by a retributive legal scheme. Weaver rejects this, insisting that the God revealed in Jesus Christ is nonviolent, that is, acting without coercive force and without authoring bloodshed. The cross is not an act God requires in order to forgive, but the predictable consequence of the **powers and principalities** resisting the **kingdom** embodied by Jesus. In **narrative Christus Victor**, Jesus lives the reign of God, confronts structural evil, is executed by state and religious authorities, and is vindicated by **resurrection**, which discloses both the injustice of his death and the victory of **God’s nonviolent power**.

The second edition of **The Nonviolent Atonement** responds to critics and engages more fully **womanist** and **feminist** concerns. Weaver invokes **Delores S. Williams** and her critique of **surrogacy** to argue that any atonement theology that glorifies innocent suffering risks underwriting the oppression of women and racialized communities. The nonviolent model does not romanticize the cross as redemptive suffering in itself. Rather, it proclaims divine deliverance from systems that create victims and calls the church to solidarity practices that resist victimization. Salvation is thus narrated as liberation from the powers that crucified Jesus, a liberation that is inherently social, political, and economic. The forensic language of justification is not denied, but it is subordinated to a canonical story in which God’s justice is restorative and reconciling, not retributive. Weaver’s **Christus Victor** is narrative because it is tied to the concrete Scriptural plot, not merely to a motif. It is nonviolent because it denies that **God** needs or employs violent means to save.

#### 4. Scripture, hermeneutics, and the God of Jesus
Weaver’s **Jesus-centered hermeneutic** is crucial to his doctrine of **God**. In **The Nonviolent God** 2013 he argues that the identity of God must be taken from the life and teaching of Jesus, especially the practices of **enemy love**, **nonretaliation**, and **cross-bearing**. If Jesus is the definitive revelation of God, then divine power must be understood as **relational, persuasive power**, not unilateral coercion. Read in this light, divine wrath is not an inner passion requiring violent satisfaction but the name for God’s opposition to evil that operates nonviolently, often as the consequence of human rebellion and the unveiling of sin’s self-destruction. This reading reframes biblical narratives that portray divine violence. Weaver urges that the church read such texts through the clarity of Jesus, adopting a canonical criterion that privileges the **Gospels** as unveiling the heart of God. He does not erase the older texts but insists they be interpreted in light of the full revelation in Christ, yielding a Scripture-shaped confession of a **nonviolent God**.

This hermeneutical stance is aligned with a historic **Anabaptist** instinct toward a canon within the canon, yet Weaver grounds it in christological claims and not merely in ethical preference. The **Sermon on the Mount** functions as theological grammar. For example, turn-the-other-cheek is not a merely human strategy for survival. It is the way God overcomes evil with good. The cross, therefore, is revelatory of God’s character. It is not a divine mechanism to assuage a wrathful deity. The resurrection, likewise, is not a mere postscript but the decisive apocalyptic unveiling that the nonviolent way of Jesus is God’s victory. The ecclesiological entailment is immediate. A people who confess a **nonviolent God** must inhabit nonviolence as their politics, economy, and worship.

#### 5. Ecclesiology and the powers
Weaver’s soteriology is inseparable from **peace church ecclesiology**. Salvation is communal incorporation into a body that has a distinct social existence, an **alternative polis** patterned by **enemy love**. He retrieves the New Testament emphasis on **principalities and powers**, reading them as structural realities embedded in political, economic, and cultural forms. The church’s vocation is to expose and unmask these powers through practices of **truth-telling**, **reconciliation**, and **noncooperation** with violence. In this register, atonement means that Jesus has inaugurated a domain where the powers no longer dictate ultimate outcomes. The church lives this deliverance by refusing to kill, by economic practices of sharing, by restorative approaches to wrongdoing, and by open-table hospitality that crosses lines of race and class. Ecclesial discipline, long cherished in Anabaptism, is interpreted not as punitive control but as a communal pedagogy into a nonviolent way of life. The **ban** is reconceived as restorative and reconciling, in accord with the **nonviolent God**.

Weaver’s attention to **womanist** and **feminist** voices shapes his ecclesial vision. He insists that a peace church must be attentive to how **patriarchy**, **white supremacy**, and **heteronormativity** are among the powers that crucify. Thus the atonement brings not only inter-personal reconciliation but systemic change. The Holy Spirit empowers a people whose liturgy and catechesis cultivate nonviolent habits, including economic resistance to exploitative systems and advocacy for the marginalized. The local congregation is the arena where the **narrative Christus Victor** is embodied and displayed to the world.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates
Weaver positions his **narrative Christus Victor** against **Anselm** and **Calvin**, but he also engages modern and contemporary conversation partners. With **Gustaf Aulén**, Weaver affirms that the early church’s dominant image of salvation was victory over the powers. Yet he sharpens Aulén’s insight by insisting that the victory must be construed nonviolently and narratively, directed to concrete historical oppressions. He converses with **John Howard Yoder** on ecclesial nonviolence, while also absorbing feminist critiques of Yoder in order to purge atonement talk of any romance with victimization. Weaver appreciates **liberation theology** in both Latin American and Black forms, especially **James H. Cone’s** insistence that salvation involves liberation from racism. He registers alignment with **womanist theology** such as **Delores S. Williams** in rejecting theories that sacralize innocent suffering and surrogacy. Weaver also interacts with critics from evangelical and Reformed quarters who defend **penal substitution**, as well as with theologians like **Miroslav Volf** who explore divine violence eschatologically. These engagements disclose Weaver’s conviction that any appeal to divine retribution compromises the confession of a **nonviolent God** and undercuts the church’s peaceable witness.

Weaver’s dialogues also extend to **narrative theology** more broadly. His work resonates with **Stanley Hauerwas** on the church as a political community, though Weaver gives soteriology a more explicit **Christus Victor** shape. He distinguishes his model from **moral exemplar** theories, arguing that Jesus does not only show us a way but decisively defeats the powers that enslave. He likewise distances his proposal from **ransom** caricatures that imply God bargains with the devil. The **narrative Christus Victor** operates by divine initiative that exposes and overcomes evil through the faithful mission of Jesus and the Spirit-sustained church.

#### 7. Doctrinal development and the nonviolent God
In **The Nonviolent God** 2013, Weaver extends soteriology into doctrine of **God** and **providence**. The classic perfections such as **omnipotence**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** are recalibrated to fit the Jesus-shaped narrative. Omnipotence is rendered as **steadfast, covenantal power** that refuses coercion. Immutability becomes God’s unchanging fidelity to the way of peace, not metaphysical stasis. Impassibility is rejected where it implies incapacity for suffering love, and reinterpreted as God’s invincible mercy that is not overwhelmed by evil. Divine action is persistent and persuasive, never annihilating creaturely agency. Weaver prefers to speak of **providence** as accompaniment and empowerment rather than control, echoing open and relational impulses without committing to process metaphysics. Judgment remains real, yet occurs as unveiling and consequence, not as divine infliction of violence.

At the heart of this doctrine is a robust **christocentrism**. If Jesus heals rather than kills enemies, then so does God. If Jesus refuses to call down legions of angels to destroy his captors, then divine victory is not achieved by overwhelming force. Weaver’s consistent refrain is that theology must not say of God what the Gospels will not allow. This constraint demands a reframing of atonement and providence that keeps the **church’s nonviolence** intelligible and sustainable. It also entails a missional posture that trusts **resurrection** as the vindication of patient peacemaking rather than recourse to deadly force.

#### 8. Significance and Reformed evaluation
Weaver’s project offers an integrated **Anabaptist** account of salvation, ecclesiology, and doctrine of God, centered on a **nonviolent** rendering of the Gospel. By insisting that God does not require violence to save, he addresses persistent critiques, especially from **womanist** and **feminist** theologians, that historic atonement theories have sacralized oppression. By narrating **Christus Victor** as deliverance from the **powers**, he relocates soteriology within the lived world of unjust structures, making salvation palpably social and political while retaining christological depth. His **Jesus-centered hermeneutic** constitutes both his greatest strength and the source of enduring debate. It yields a compelling account of how doctrine and practice coinhere in a peace church and clarifies why the **Sermon on the Mount** belongs at the center of Christian speech. It also raises questions about the canon’s unity and the scope of divine justice.

From a **Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary** perspective, the contrasts are principled and instructive. Weaver’s **narrative Christus Victor** rightly recovers biblical warfare imagery against the powers and insists on an ecclesial embodiment of the kingdom, themes that classical Reformed theology can affirm through **covenant** and **union with Christ**. Yet serious tensions remain. First, by redefining **divine justice** almost entirely as restorative and reading **wrath** non-retributively, Weaver undercuts the canonical witness to God’s holy opposition to sin as judicially expressed in the cross. Reformed theology insists that **penal substitution** is a trinitarian self-substitution, not divine child abuse, safeguarding both **divine love** and **justice**. Second, his **canon-within-the-canon** risks severing Jesus from Israel’s Scriptures and the apostolic kerygma, whereas Reformed exegesis seeks a canon-wide harmony in which **sacrifice**, **exodus**, and **Isaiah’s Servant** find fulfillment, not negation, in Christ. Third, Weaver’s construal of **providence** as noncoercive relationality tends toward an attenuation of **sovereignty** that classical Reformed theology deems necessary for the assurance of grace and the hope of judgment against evil. A Reformed alternative would integrate **Christus Victor** with **penal substitution**, as many have argued from Romans 3 and Colossians 2, and preserve a robust **trinitarian** account of the cross as the locus where God, in love, bears his own righteous verdict against sin in the person of the Son. Such an integration would secure the liberative, anti-oppressive fruits that Weaver seeks while maintaining the canonical coherence of **justice**, **wrath**, and **mercy** within the one character of the triune God.
