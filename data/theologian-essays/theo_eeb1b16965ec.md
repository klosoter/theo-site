### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and vocation
Deborah B. Haarsma emerged within the late twentieth-century **evangelical** academy as a professionally trained **astronomer** who refused the false dichotomy between **scientific cosmology** and **biblical doctrine of creation**. Educated to the doctoral level in astrophysics in the 1990s and teaching at **Calvin College** through the 2000s, she brought expertise in **cosmic structure**, **Big Bang cosmology**, and the **age of the universe** into conversation with **Reformed** and broadly **evangelical** theology. Her vocational pivot in 2013 to the presidency of **BioLogos**, the organization founded by **Francis Collins**, situated her at a cultural flashpoint where **young-earth creationism**, **Intelligent Design**, and **scientific atheism** contested the public imagination. Haarsma’s enduring contribution is not a novel doctrine but a sustained pedagogical and apologetic practice: translating the **two books** conviction of **Belgic Confession 2** into the register of contemporary **evolutionary biology** and **cosmology**, while maintaining the authority of **Scripture** and the centrality of **Christ**.

From the outset Haarsma framed her work against a background of evangelical fragmentation over **Genesis 1–11**, **human origins**, and the **historicity of Adam**, controversies intensified by twentieth-century **fundamentalist-modernist** debates and late modern concerns about **inerrancy**. She stepped into this terrain as a scientist fluent in **observational evidence** for cosmic antiquity and common descent, yet conversant with **Augustinian** and **Reformed** accounts of **creation**, **providence**, and **sin**. This dual fluency marks her method with a distinctive blend of **critical realism** and **Augustinian humility** about the limits of human **scientia Dei** and human science alike.

#### 2. Method: two books, critical realism, and methodological naturalism
Haarsma’s method operationalizes the classic **duo libri** theme, the book of **Scripture** and the book of **nature**, without collapsing one into the other. She resists **concordism**, the impulse to identify contemporary scientific claims directly in biblical texts, instead privileging **accommodation** in the tradition of **Calvin** and **Augustine**, where God speaks *baby talk* to finite minds. In her hands, **accommodation** explains the ancient **cosmography** of Genesis without impugning the **inspiration** or **infallibility** of the text. Simultaneously she affirms **methodological naturalism** as a rule of scientific practice rather than a **metaphysical naturalism**, thereby disallowing a priori exclusion of **divine action** while insisting that scientific descriptions of **regularities** remain methodologically circumspect.

This method is expressed in a chastened **critical realism**. Scientific theories, on this construal, aim at the real structures of the created order, but their epistemic status is provisional, corrigible, and instrumentally guided. Theologically, she retrieves **Warfield’s** openness to **evolution** as a possible mode of **concursus**, the simultaneous operation of **providence** and creaturely causality. The rubric is **creatio ex nihilo** with **providentia Dei** over all that occurs, including stochastic processes; the epistemic stance is **fiducia** in God’s self-revelation with patience toward scientific development. This posture permits a non-defensive openness to **Big Bang cosmology**, **radiometric dating**, and **genomic evidence** for common ancestry as descriptions of the good order of creation.

#### 3. Major works and pedagogical project
The collaborative volume **Origins: Christian Perspectives on Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design** first appeared in 2007 with a revised edition in 2011, functioning as Haarsma’s principal pedagogical platform. The book maps the conceptual terrain: **young-earth creation**, **old-earth progressive creation**, **Intelligent Design**, and **evolutionary creation**. Its distinctive contribution is not polemical victory but conceptual clarity, rehearsing evidence for an ancient cosmos, explaining the predictive success of **evolutionary theory**, and then articulating why **evolutionary creation** coheres with **biblical theism**. Later, in the 2017 **Four Views on Creation, Evolution, and Intelligent Design**, the BioLogos contribution attributed to **Deborah and Loren Haarsma** set the evolutionary creation case alongside **Hugh Ross** for old-earth creation, **Ken Ham** for young-earth creation, and **Stephen C. Meyer** representing the **Intelligent Design** critique. Across these venues and the stream of **BioLogos** essays during her presidency, Haarsma positioned evolutionary creation as a form of **mere evangelical orthodoxy** about **creation** and **providence**, combined with confidence in scientific discovery as an exercise of **common grace**.

Stylistically, these works display a catechetical patience that combines University-level explanation of **stellar lifecycles** and **genetics** with pastoral attentiveness to **Scripture’s authority**. She regularly foregrounds **creatio ex nihilo**, **imago Dei**, and the **goodness of creation** as dogmatic anchors, then proceeds to show how **Big Bang cosmology** and **evolutionary mechanisms** do not negate the doctrine of **divine design**, rightly construed as **teleology** under **providence**, rather than as gaps in causal accounts. The effect is a re-framing: instead of asking where science fails and therefore God acts, she asks how God’s **ordinary providence** encompasses the entire causal nexus, including what scientists call **randomness**.

#### 4. Doctrine of creation: ex nihilo, goodness, and dynamic formational economy
At the doctrinal core of Haarsma’s project lies an evangelical retrieval of **creatio ex nihilo** and the **goodness of creation**, extended to a dynamic history. Drawing on insights congenial to **Howard Van Till’s** language of a **robust formational economy** and paralleling broader **theistic evolution** discourse, she presents creation as endowed with capacities for **self-organization** that unfold under **God’s governance**. In cosmology this means a universe expanding and cooling from an initial high-energy state with **nucleosynthesis**, **stellar formation**, and **planetary accretion**, all governed by stable **laws** that are, theologically, the faithfulness of **God’s word** in the *ad extra* order. In biology it means that **mutation**, **selection**, **gene flow**, and **genetic drift** are part of the creaturely grammar by which God brings about life’s diversity.

Crucial here is Haarsma’s insistence that **natural regularity** does not imply divine absence. By returning to **providence** and **concursus**, she reads the regularities as the theater of **God’s ordinary action**, reserving **miracles** for redemptive-historical signs. She demurs from **Intelligent Design’s** explanatory program, not because she denies divine design but because she thinks design is not methodologically discerned through specified complexity but theologically confessed in light of **creation’s intelligibility** and **Scripture’s witness**. The more contemporary contention she directly contests is that evolution entails nihilistic **randomness**. For Haarsma, the term random in scientific discourse marks epistemic unpredictability or statistical distribution, not ontological indeterminacy with respect to **divine sovereignty**. Thus **randomness under providence** is a keystone phrase in her account.

#### 5. Scripture, hermeneutics, and theological authority
If evolutionary creation is the scientific-scaffolding side of Haarsma’s project, the **hermeneutical** side is equally central. She emphasizes **Scripture’s inspiration and authority** while resisting a literalistic **concordism**. Here she leans on scholars like **John Walton** to argue that **Genesis 1–2** addresses **cosmic temple** and **functional origins** rather than scientific material origins, and that the ancient **ANE context** is crucial for reading. The doctrine of **accommodation** helps explain ancient **phenomenological** language like the **firmament** without rendering the text errant in what it intends to teach about **God, creation’s goodness, and human vocation**. In this key, the **two books** motif is not license to let nature correct Scripture, but a confession that God’s **self-revelation** through nature and Scripture is unified in its Author and so non-competitive.

Haarsma also addresses **inerrancy** carefully. Her public statements at **BioLogos** tend to affirm **infallibility** and the trustworthy character of Scripture for all it intends to teach, urging the **analogia fidei** as the hermeneutical control: let clearer central texts interpret the less clear. The practical effect is to protect the gospel core about **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**, while allowing serious exegetical work to recalibrate popular evangelical readings of **days**, **chronology**, and **cosmic order**. The hope is to free confession of **Christ as Creator** and **Lord** from entanglement with disputable scientific claims.

#### 6. Anthropology, Adam, and the doctrine of sin
Haarsma’s most contested proposals arise in the area of **anthropology** and **hamartiology**. Affirming that **humans are in the imago Dei**, called to represent and commune with God, she highlights capacities for **relationship**, **moral responsibility**, and **worship** rather than biological distinctives. Given genomic and paleoanthropological evidence for deep human ancestry and population sizes inconsistent with a single modern human pair as biological progenitors, she explores alternative models for **Adam and Eve**. In public BioLogos materials during her tenure, she has presented options: **Adam as historical representative** within a larger population, **Adam as literary-archtypal** figure conveying theological universals, and later dialogue about a **genealogical Adam** model that situates a historical pair whose genealogical, though not genetic, ancestry becomes universal. Each model is weighed against **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** on **original sin** and **federal headship**.

On **the Fall**, Haarsma distinguishes **spiritual death** and alienation from God from the biological death present in the animal realm prior to human sin. She reads **Romans 5** as teaching that death spread to all humans by sin, not as a claim about animal mortality. This preserves the empirical reality of predation and extinction across deep time while maintaining the universality of human sin. Theologically, she urges focus on the reality of **universal sin**, the necessity of **atonement**, and the victory of the **second Adam**, rather than on a particular mechanism of transmission that binds interpreters to reject well-attested creaturely history. Her goal remains evangelical orthodoxy on **sin and salvation**, with hermeneutical latitude on human origins.

#### 7. Divine action, providence, and the problem of suffering
Haarsma’s account of **divine action** threads between occasionalism and deism by retrieving classic **providence** while engaging modern science. She affirms **meticulous sovereignty** in confessional terms while clarifying distinctions between **ordinary** and **extraordinary** divine action. The ordinary is the theater of God’s **faithful governance**; the extraordinary are the **miraculous signs** especially clustered around **Christ’s incarnation and resurrection**. The category of **concursus** enables a both-and: creaturely causes are real, and God is personally active in and through them. On **randomness**, her language emphasizes epistemic limits and statistical patterns, thereby refusing to grant metaphysical independence to chance events from **God’s counsel**.

Regarding **natural evil** and suffering, Haarsma adopts a cruciform theodicy informed by **Romans 8**. She acknowledges the long history of death, extinction, and earthquakes as part of the created order’s groaning, reframes the good of creation as a **teleological good** oriented to **new creation**, and places suffering in the cosmos within God’s larger redemptive story culminating in the **resurrection**. Evolutionary processes are not morally evil per se but ambiguous features of a good yet not-yet-consummated order. The pastoral outcome is to direct Christians to the cross and hope of **consummation**, not to scientific details, for ultimate comfort.

#### 8. Ecclesial and cultural engagement
As BioLogos president from 2013 onward, Haarsma’s theological project is inseparable from an ecclesial mission to build trust between the **church** and the **scientific community**. She convened dialogues with **pastors**, **educators**, and **scientists**, curated resources on **creation care**, and frequently engaged critics from **young-earth** and **Intelligent Design** circles. The hallmark of her leadership is irenic clarity: she grants the integrity of **evangelical convictions** about **Scripture and salvation** while urging reconsideration of certain cultural boundary markers. Her public posture prioritizes **unity in the gospel** and **charity** within the household of faith, even as she defends the scientific consensus on **age of the earth** and **common descent**. In this way, her theological labor is also an act of spiritual hospitality framed by **common grace** and **Christian mission**.

Her interlocutions give the profile sharper edges. With **Hugh Ross**, she shares commitment to an ancient cosmos but debates **biological evolution**. With **Ken Ham**, she shares zeal for **Scripture** but disputes hermeneutical constraints and scientific claims. With **Stephen C. Meyer** and the **Intelligent Design** movement, she shares the rejection of **materialism** but contests the scientific strategy and the theological risk of a **God-of-the-gaps**. Internally, she draws upon the work of **John Walton**, **Denis Alexander**, and **N. T. Wright** to scaffold biblical and theological accounts compatible with evolutionary science. In every case, her rhetorical aim is less to vanquish opponents than to secure **evangelical confidence** in God’s world and Word.

#### 9. An evangelical synthesis and its limits
Haarsma’s synthesis can be distilled as follows: the triune God creates and sustains all things by the Word, **creatio ex nihilo** grounds the world’s stability, **providence** encompasses both lawful regularity and rare miracles, human beings are bearers of the **imago Dei** within a long creaturely history, **sin** is universal and death reigns apart from Christ, and salvation is in the **second Adam**, by **grace** through **faith**. Within this dogmatic frame, she contends, the sciences can be received gratefully as truthful descriptions of the creaturely theater. The critical hinge is the **two books doctrine**, coupled with **accommodation** and non-**concordist** hermeneutics, which together allow evangelical theology to engage **Big Bang cosmology** and **evolutionary biology** without doctrinal surrender.

Yet the very hinge is also the site of tension. Her constructive project depends on careful delimitation of what **Scripture intends to teach** in primeval history and on the elasticity of **anthropology** around **Adam** and **original sin**. The more one insists on a specific **federal headship** tied to a particular historical pair as sole biological progenitors, the less room there is for some models she canvasses. Conversely, the more one relaxes historical particularity, the more one risks diluting the Pauline texture of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**. Haarsma’s reply is to foreground the theological telos in **Christ**, urging that historic **evangelical orthodoxy** be secured in soteriological, not paleogenomic, terms.

#### 10. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
A Reformed and specifically **Westminster** evaluation of Haarsma should begin with genuine appreciation. Her invocation of **Belgic Confession 2** on the **two books**, her affirmation of **creatio ex nihilo** and **providence**, and her alignment with **Warfield** in allowing **evolution** as a possible mode of **concursus** fit within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. Her stress on **Scripture’s authority**, **accommodation**, and the proper limits of **scientific method** coheres with **WCF I** on the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture and **WCF V** on **providence**. Moreover, her refusal of **God-of-the-gaps** reasoning resonates with **Calvin’s** insistence on recognizing God’s **ordinary governance**.

The tensions, however, are real and should be named. First, on **revelation and hermeneutics**, a Westminster hermeneutic requires that **Scripture interpret Scripture** in such a way that its historical claims cannot be relativized by extra-scriptural consensus. Haarsma’s non-**concordist** posture can, in practice, tilt toward letting current science narrow the range of exegetical options, particularly in **Genesis 1–11**. A corrective within Reformed orthodoxy would be to ground **accommodation** more explicitly in **covenantal history**, ensuring that literary and ANE insights serve rather than steer canonical exegesis. Second, on **nature and providence**, her construal of **randomness** as epistemic is compatible with **meticulous sovereignty**, yet care is needed to confess **divine concursus** without softening God’s **comprehensive decree** in **WCF III**. Third, on **anthropology and original sin**, Westminster’s **covenant of works**, **federal headship**, and monogenism are not easily squared with purely **archetypal** or purely non-historical **Adam** models. BioLogos conversations about a **genealogical Adam** point toward a possible rapprochement that safeguards **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** while respecting population genetics, and a Westminster-friendly evolutionary creation would anchor strongly in such a model and in the confessional commitment to a real historical Fall. Finally, on **Scripture’s sufficiency**, the Reformed instinct is to let **special revelation** set the doctrinal architecture while receiving **general revelation** by **common grace** in a ministerial role. Haarsma’s best work honors this order; where it wavers, a Reformed recalibration will prioritize covenantal exegesis and **federal theology** as the controlling frame for engaging the sciences.
