### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Adrienne Mayor is a contemporary American scholar whose signature contribution is to read ancient myth as **folk science** in conversation with **classical texts**, **archaeology**, and **natural history**. Working in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, and long affiliated as a research scholar with **Stanford University** in **Classics** and the **History of Science**, she helped pioneer a public-facing yet rigorously sourced approach to the **myth-history continuum**. Her intellectual setting draws on Anglophone classical scholarship after the social turn of the 1970s and 1980s, responsive to **anthropology**, **material culture**, and the renewed attention to **technics** in humanities discourse. Methodologically, Mayor practices an evidential triangulation: close reading of **Herodotus**, **Pliny the Elder**, **Pausanias**, and other ancient witnesses; on-the-ground attention to **fossils**, **artifacts**, and **topography**; and historical reconstruction governed by a modest **methodological naturalism** that still honors narrative meaning. The watchword is **geomythology**. Following earlier use of the term in geology and folklore, she advances a program in which *mythoi* are rational inferences from *physis* mediated by *techne*, a move that resists both reductive demythologizing and romantic mystification.

Mayor’s epistemic stance can be stated succinctly: ancient people observed anomalous features of the world, formed **inferential myths** that explained those anomalies, and circulated them as **cultural memory** within trade routes, cults, and polities. This posture is not positivism. It seeks a chastened realism about the referential density of **mythic narrative**, while recognizing that pain, awe, and fear also drive symbolic elaboration. Her pages echo with the ancient terms *thauma* wonder and *tekhnē* craft. The result is an account of **myth** that is neither mere fiction nor concealed dogma, but a repository of pre- and proto-scientific conjecture framed by ethical imagination.

#### 2. Fossils, giants, and cultural memory
Mayor’s breakthrough thesis appears in **The First Fossil Hunters: Paleontology in Greek and Roman Times** (2000), where she argues that many classical stories of **giants**, **monsters**, and **hero bones** are embedded reports of fossil encounters. Greek and Roman travelers in areas rich with **Protoceratops**, **mastodon**, and other large remains would naturally interpret beaks, talons, and massive femurs through available categories of **myth** and **religion**. The mythic griffin guarding gold in Scythia, preserved in **Aeschylus** and later **Pliny the Elder**, plausibly encodes encounters with beaked dinosaur skulls along Central Asian trade corridors, an instance of **folk science** negotiating strangeness. Mayor correlates these narratives with **archaeological sites**, **geological strata**, and **itineraries**, producing a textured case for **cultural memory** as a form of natural history.

In **Fossil Legends of the First Americans** (2005), she extends the same **geomythological** lens to Indigenous North American traditions, documenting how stories of thunderbirds, water monsters, and primordial battles register observation of **fossil beds** on the Plains and in the Southwest. Without collapsing spiritual narratives into geology, she demonstrates that communities can sustain precise local knowledge of **paleontological** phenomena for centuries. The cumulative effect of these volumes is to normalize a disciplined reading of **myth** as empirical attention refracted through ritual life and collective imagination, a posture hospitable to a chastened **natural theology** that listens to the world and its witnesses.

#### 3. Toxins, warfare, and the science of enmity
Mayor’s second major research arc investigates ancient **toxicology** and **warfare** as sites where *techne* and morality entwine. In **Greek Fire, Poison Arrows, and Scorpion Bombs** (2003; revised 2008), she reconstructs a long history of **chemical** and **biological** weapons, from petroleum-based **Greek fire** to **hellebore** poisonings and the gruesome logic of scorpion jars hurled in siege warfare. The book maps the interplay of **innovation**, **taboo**, and **law**, arguing that classical societies held ambivalent norms about the legitimacy of such technologies, oscillating between admiration for cunning and revulsion before perceived **hubris**. The evidence includes technical descriptions in **Byzantine** military manuals, anecdotal reports in **Polybius**, and forensic clues from battlefield archaeology, all integrated into a sober assessment of ancient **ethics of war**.

This investigation naturally segues into **The Poison King: The Life and Legend of Mithradates** (2009), a biography of **Mithradates VI of Pontus** that became a National Book Award finalist. Mayor narrates the king’s obsessive regime of **mithridatism**, the gradual ingestion of toxins to cultivate immunity, and his legendary **universal antidote**, **mithridatium**. More than a colorful portrait, the book discloses a deep ancient curiosity about **pharmakon** as both remedy and threat, an instability already signaled by the double sense of the Greek term. The ethical question is perennial: when does human mastery over nature tip into **transgression**. Mayor lets the tangled evidence stage that question, giving readers a grammar to parse **technological ambivalence** in antiquity.

#### 4. Amazons and the ethnography of the other
With **The Amazons: Lives and Legends of Warrior Women across the Ancient World** (2014), Mayor tests her **myth-history** method against gender and ethnography. She argues that Greek tales of **Amazons** reflect sustained contacts with **Scythian** and **Sarmatian** peoples of the steppe, where bioarchaeology now confirms high-status female burials with weapons and equestrian gear. The book coordinates **iconography**, **burial assemblages**, and **texts** to present Amazons as a refracted ethnographic memory of mobile, horse-centered societies with more flexible gender roles than polis Greece. The point is not to sanitize the myth but to uncover how Greek imagination negotiated alterity through the figures of **armed women**, **inverted customs**, and contested **virtue**.

Mayor emphasizes how Greco-Persian and Greco-Scythian frontiers transmitted not only commodities but **stories**. Her attentiveness to **trade networks**, **linguistic borrowing**, and **ritual exchange** positions myth as a mediator of cultural boundary-work. Amazons sit at that threshold where admiration and fear converge, yielding a mirror for Greek anxieties about **oikos**, **polis**, and **andreia** courageous manliness. By reading the stories in tandem with **kurgan** excavations and shifting the lens from Athens to the steppe, Mayor reframes the Amazon not as fantasy but as ethnographic **palimpsest**.

#### 5. Automata, artificial life, and ancient futures
In **Gods and Robots: Myths, Machines, and Ancient Dreams of Technology** (2018), Mayor explores ancient imaginings of **automata**, **androids**, and **artificial life** as speculative ethics of technology. She surveys **Hephaestus** and his golden servants, **Talos** the bronze sentinel of Crete, **Pandora** as engineered maiden, **Pygmalion**’s animate sculpture, and **Daedalus** with his lifelike artworks, correlating myths with historical devices described by **Hero of Alexandria** and **Philon of Byzantium**. The argument is not that Greeks built computers, but that ancient culture already interrogated the moral stakes of creating lifelike artifacts. Categories such as **hubris**, **limits of techne**, and the porous boundary between *physis* and *nomos* order these tales, displaying a robust prehistory for debates about **AI**, **biotech**, and **automation**.

Mayor’s framing treats the myths as laboratories of **prudence**, staging thought experiments about control, autonomy, and the dangers of overreach. The ancient material models recurring dilemmas: Can human makers be trusted with **power** that mimics **creation**. What responsibilities attend animated artifacts. Where is the line between helpful **instrument** and oppressive **idol**. By showing the depth and reach of these questions in antiquity, Mayor offers contemporary discourse a genealogy of **technological imagination** that predates modernity’s Promethean self-understanding.

#### 6. Conceptual synthesis: myth, evidence, and technics
Across these studies, Mayor’s conceptual center holds by way of three linked ideas: **myth as inference**, **evidence as triangulated correlation**, and **technics as moral experiment**. First, **myth as inference** insists that narrative often encodes disciplined observations about a resistant world. Second, **triangulation** means that textual claims are tested against **material culture** and **natural phenomena**, with neither register allowed to dominate. Third, **technics as moral experiment** sees stories of toxins, weapons, and automata as exercises in practical reasoning, ancient casuistry in narrative form. This triad stabilizes a method coherent with the best of **classical philology** and **history of science**, while remaining accessible to public readership.

Theologically, this synthesis indirectly illuminates themes of **creation**, **human dominion**, and **prudence**. One could say that Mayor’s approach highlights the latent *logoi* of the world in a way reminiscent of the Stoic **logoi spermatikoi** seed-like rational principles, though without metaphysical commitments. It thereby opens a conversation with **natural theology** understood as disciplined attention to creaturely givenness. Her emphasis on **cultural memory** also resonates with ecclesial practices of tradition and remembrance, even as her materials are pre-Christian and diverse. The result is an archive in which theologians may listen to human efforts to read the book of **nature** and to measure the risks of human **making**.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
Mayor’s work converses fruitfully with **Walter Burkert** on the biological and ritual roots of **Greek religion**, with **Mircea Eliade** on **myth** and the sacred, and with historians of technology like **Lewis Mumford** and classicists attentive to **materiality**. Against older allegorizing that treated myths as esoteric philosophical codes, she sides with a pragmatic, **empiricist hermeneutic** that honors the referential reach of stories. In debates over **Greek fire** and **chemical warfare**, she navigates between sensationalism and anachronism, holding to textual specificity while drawing cautious lines to modern **weapons ethics**. Critics sometimes question the confidence of specific identifications, such as linking griffins to **Protoceratops**, warning against confirmation bias. Yet even skeptical readers concede that her larger case for **mythic rationality** remains compelling and heuristically productive.

Reception within **classics**, **archaeology**, and **history of science** has been robust, in part because Mayor writes with documentary density and clear hypotheses. Her portrait of **Mithradates** reframed debates about **toxicology** and political charisma, while **The Amazons** catalyzed new comparative work on steppe **bioarchaeology** and Greek **ethnography**. **Gods and Robots** has entered conversations in **STS** science and technology studies about the longue durée of **automation** and **AI** ethics. More broadly, her oeuvre bolsters the case for porous boundaries between **myth**, **history**, and **science**, encouraging a holistic understanding of the ancient world’s intellectual life.

#### 8. Strengths, limits, and theological uses
The strengths of Mayor’s project are clear: a disciplined confidence that **ancient observers** were keen naturalists; a demonstrated capacity to correlate **narrative**, **artifact**, and **landscape**; and a sensitive ear for the ethical resonance of **technics**. Her writing gives back to antiquity the dignity of careful **observation** and creative **inference**. Limits likewise appear. The pull toward **methodological naturalism** sometimes screens out religious causality and transcendence that ancient actors regarded as real. The very success of **geomythology** can risk binarizing mythic imagination into a map of **referents** that under-reads ritual depth and metaphysical belief. And the ethics of **warfare** and **technology** reconstructed from texts may not fully reckon with structural factors like empire, slavery, and cult that condition **moral imagination**.

For theology, however, these limits can be instructive. By showing how stories function as both **knowledge** and **prudence**, Mayor equips theologians to parse biblical and extra-biblical **narratives** without choosing between literalism and allegory. Her archive models how **creation** can be known through patient **attention** and how **human making** always calls for caution under the shadow of **hubris**. The overlap with premodern casuistry is striking: ancient myths often stage the very dilemmas later treated in scholastic **virtue ethics**. The upshot is a repertoire for engaging **general revelation** in the widest cultural field.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and WTS vantage, Mayor’s corpus is a rich witness to **general revelation** and **common grace** at work in pagan societies, even as it exemplifies the noetic limits of **autonomous reason**. Her **geomythology** rightly honors that the heavens and the earth declare knowledge and that image-bearers construct **folk science** by reading *physis* through *techne*. Yet her method prescinds from **special revelation** and thus cannot adjudicate the antithesis between worship of the **Creator** and veneration of **creaturely powers**. The **myth-history continuum** that serves her historical aims can flatten **covenant history**, in which God’s acts interpret nature rather than nature interpreting itself. Likewise, while **Gods and Robots** brilliantly catalogs ancient anxieties about **artifice**, it lacks a teleological account of **imago Dei**, **Sabbath rest**, and **dominion under law** that would norm human **making** toward doxology rather than toward ambiguous **prometheanism**. The Reformed alternative is principled yet appreciative: receive Mayor’s demonstrations of **creational intelligibility** as instances of **common grace**, deploy **Calvin’s spectacles** of Scripture to distinguish **wisdom** from **idolatry**, and integrate her ethical insights into a covenantal account of **nature and culture** where knowledge of fossils, toxins, Amazons, and automata is pressed into the service of **prudence**, **neighbor love**, and praise of the **Triune God**.
