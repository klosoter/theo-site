### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Heidi A. Campbell emerges as a leading voice in the study of **digital religion**, working at the intersection of **communication theory**, **sociology of religion**, and **practical theology** within the late-modern **network society** that **Manuel Castells** mapped in the 1990s. Trained across religious studies and communication and later appointed at **Texas A&M University** in **Communication**, Campbell helped consolidate a new subfield in the 2000s through the Network for **New Media, Religion and Digital Culture Studies**. Her work answers the question, how do religious communities inhabit and interpret **new media** as they navigate changing ecologies of **authority**, **identity**, and **practice**. The context is decisive: post-1995 internet diffusion, Web 2.0 interactivity after 2004, and the consolidation of **platformization** in the 2010s created an environment where religious life is increasingly mediated by digital infrastructures with specific **affordances** and political economies. Against both technological determinism and naive analog revivalism, Campbell articulates a mediating stance that foregrounds **social shaping** within religious traditions.

Methodologically, Campbell advances a thick descriptive program that blends **digital ethnography**, qualitative interviews, and case-comparative analysis across traditions including **Christianity**, **Judaism**, and **Islam**. Her signature proposal, the **religious-social shaping of technology (RSST)**, extends the **Social Shaping of Technology** and **SCOT** paradigms by arguing that technologies are filtered and appropriated through religious narratives, authorities, and boundary practices. In doing so she uses tools from **mediatization theory** to describe how media logics penetrate religious institutions, but without collapsing religion into media effects. A hallmark of her method is attention to **domestication**: how communities narrate, ritualize, and normalize tools like websites, social media, and livestreams, thereby integrating them into a moral universe. Theologically, Campbell is descriptive rather than confessional; yet in texts like **Networked Theology** 2016 with **Stephen Garner** she pivots from description to constructive engagement, inviting ecclesial discernment about **discipleship**, **presence**, and **authority** in digital culture.

#### 2. Early articulation: Exploring online community
Campbell’s first monograph, **Exploring Religious Community Online** 2005, situates digital community in relation to **ecclesiology** and **communitarian** concerns about fragmentation. Employing **online ethnography**, she analyzes Christian groups and Jewish communities that deploy forums, email lists, and early social media to sustain fellowship. Against the charge that online ties are necessarily thin, she demonstrates that **storied identity** and shared ritual markers can be cultivated digitally when communities anchor interaction in a tradition-prior moral narrative. The analysis names three dynamics that foreshadow later theory: the ongoing negotiation of **authority** between clergy and laity, the importance of community self-descriptions as **testimony** shaping ethical norms, and the coupling of online-plus-offline as a **multisite reality** rather than mutually exclusive spheres. In short, she positions the internet not as a virtual escape but as an extension of communal life, guided by **tradition** and mediated by specific **affordances** such as asynchronicity, persistence, and searchability.

The early period also sees Campbell arguing that religious actors are not merely users but co-producers of digital culture through **boundary work**. Communities articulate what counts as faithful communication, what online practices violate **holiness** norms, and which roles gatekeep doctrinal fidelity. This boundary work anticipates her later interest in **shifting authority**, where interpretive power migrates from centralized institutions to networked nodes including charismatic lay leaders and platformed influencers. Throughout, Campbell resists both utopian liberation narratives and dystopian loss narratives, insisting on historically situated evaluation that recalls pre-digital media controversies over the printing press, radio, and television, thereby embedding digital adoption within a longue durée of religious **mediatization**.

#### 3. RSST and the domestication of new media
The pivotal synthesis appears in **When Religion Meets New Media** 2010, where Campbell formalizes **RSST** as a program for explaining how belief communities evaluate and appropriate technologies. Drawing on **Bijker** and **Pinch** while modifying their secular frameworks, she contends that religious groups enact a four-fold process: first, they frame a technology through the lens of **history and tradition** to determine perceived fit; second, they engage in **negotiation** and **boundary work** to specify legitimate and illegitimate uses; third, they enact **ritualization** and **domestication**, embedding the tool into practices and norms; fourth, they narrate collective **moral stories** about technology, consolidating communal memory and shaping future adoption. This **religious-social shaping of technology** recognizes **affordances** but denies that affordances dictate outcomes. It highlights how religious teloi, notions of authority, and soteriological concerns guide technical appropriation.

RSST has three crucial implications for theology. First, it foregrounds the role of **ecclesial authority** in translating media affordances into normed practice, whether via episcopal pronouncements, synodical decisions, or congregational polities. Second, it invites reflection on **sacramentality** and **presence**: whether and how digital mediations can extend, supplement, or distort practices oriented to bodily gathering and material signs. Third, it reframes debates about **mission** and **public theology** in terms of attention economies and **platformization**, naming the structural pressures that shape Christian outreach and catechesis. By insisting that religious traditions do not merely react to technology but actively reauthor its function through shared convictions, Campbell offers theologians a diagnosis tool capable of navigating both adoption and resistance with conceptual rigor.

#### 4. Networked religion as an analytic map
In essays and in the edited volume **Digital Religion: Understanding Religious Practice in New Media Worlds** 2013 with a substantially updated edition in 2021, Campbell introduces the field-defining model of **networked religion**. She identifies five features. First, **networked community**: social ties reconfigured by network logics, where membership is layered, optional, and sustained through persistent micro-interactions shaped by connectivity and algorithmic sorting. Second, **storied identity**: self-presentation and testimony unfold through ongoing narrative production, memes, and digital artifacts that stabilize belonging in relation to a tradition. Third, **shifting authority**: institutions lose monopoly over interpretation as new actors such as bloggers, podcasters, and platform pastors leverage **symbolic capital** to claim voice, often validated by follower counts and engagement metrics. Fourth, **convergent practice**: the coalescence of prayer, catechesis, activism, and commerce across media channels produces braided religious repertoires. Fifth, **multisite reality**: the dissolution of online-offline binaries into a lived continuum in which sanctuary, street, and screen co-constitute religious space.

This analytic map is not merely descriptive. It functions as a heuristic for ecclesial strategy in a **mediatized** environment. For instance, **networked community** raises questions about catechetical depth and pastoral oversight when membership is punctiform rather than parochial. **Storied identity** presses the integration of digital testimony with the church’s **catechism** and liturgical calendar. **Shifting authority** forces explicit reflection on the basis, scope, and limits of teaching office in contexts where **algorithmic authority** confers legitimacy through visibility rather than ordination. **Convergent practice** suggests new synergies as well as risks of commodification, while **multisite reality** reframes the meaning of place, presence, and pilgrimage. Campbell’s intervention equips theologians to parse these dynamics without confusing them with ecclesial essence, yet also without ignoring their real formative power.

#### 5. Authority after the platform turn
A major thread in Campbell’s 2010s and 2020s work interrogates **religious authority** in platform ecosystems. In **Digital Creatives and the Rethinking of Religious Authority** 2020 she analyzes religious digital creatives who function as hybrid actors: part catechist, part content marketer, part community organizer. Drawing on **Nick Couldry** on media power and **Henry Jenkins** on **convergence culture**, she shows how authority decouples from office and reattaches to relational trust, technical skill, and platform-specific literacies. Here **algorithmic authority** names the way visibility, verification, and virality act as quasi-sacramental signs of credibility within a platform’s political economy. Authority becomes distributed, contingent, and datafied, with complex interactions between institutional churches and entrepreneurial voices.

Campbell neither simply celebrates nor condemns this decentering. She notes that **shifting authority** can empower marginalized voices, democratize access to theological conversation, and foster agile missional experimentation. Yet she also highlights pathologies: commercialization of belief, susceptibility to disinformation, and the erosion of **traditioned** oversight. Through **RSST**, she contends that communities can negotiate these pressures by articulating norms for attribution, accountability, and doctrinal vetting that respect both charisms and offices. The core tension is between **charismatic authority** performed through platforms and **institutional authority** grounded in historic polities; Campbell offers tools for mapping this tension without presupposing a single ecclesiological resolution.

#### 6. Pandemic shock and digital ecclesiology
The COVID-19 crisis accelerated trajectories that Campbell had tracked for two decades. In the edited collection **The Distanced Church: Reflections on Doing Church Online** 2020 and related reports, she documents how churches worldwide pivoted to livestreams, Zoom liturgies, and digitally mediated pastoral care. The pandemic functioned as a global experiment in **digital ecclesiology**, forcing communities to improvise new rituals, rethink **presence**, and rearticulate the relation of online to embodied gathering. Campbell’s analyses emphasize the agency of local leaders and volunteers, the role of **affordances** such as chat windows in reshaping congregational participation, and the importance of narrative framing in stabilizing practices, whether as emergency measures or enduring hybrids.

From an analytic standpoint, the pandemic confirmed the salience of **multisite reality** and **convergent practice**. Prayer chains sprawled across messaging apps, liturgy met the living room, and pastoral counseling became screen-mediated. Campbell tracks the emergence of best practices and cautions, asking what is lost when **sacramentality** is mediated without shared space and what is gained by access and inclusivity. She resists reduction to mere functionality by urging communities to articulate the theological telos of worship and discipleship and then assess digital means through **RSST** rather than convenience. Her work here exemplifies a practical-theological stance that honors doctrinal convictions while recognizing the inescapable **mediatization** of late-modern religious life.

#### 7. Comparative breadth and field building
Beyond core monographs, Campbell has shaped the intellectual infrastructure of the field through the edited **Digital Religion** volumes 2013 and 2021, convening scholars across traditions and methods. She situates **digital religion** in dialogue with **Mia Lovheim** on gender and religion online, **Pauline Cheong** on religious authority and digital networks, and **Stewart Hoover** on media, ritual, and identity. The volumes map key debates: authenticity versus performance, community versus network, and institutional versus entrepreneurial models of authority. Campbell’s editorial hand advances a vocabulary that is now standard: **networked religion**, **algorithmic authority**, **platformization**, and **affordances** as theological variables.

Her cross-religious comparisons stabilize the generalizability of **RSST**. For example, Orthodox Jewish negotiations of internet filters, Muslim rulings on online modesty, and evangelical debates over online communion are read as structurally similar exercises in **boundary work** under mediatized pressure. The comparative frame clarifies that what is at stake is not merely technology adoption but the rearticulation of **tradition**, **law**, and **authority** in light of changing communicative infrastructures. Campbell thus curates a field that is both empirically grounded and theoretically generative, supplying theologians and practitioners with categories that travel across contexts without erasing confessional specificity.

#### 8. Toward constructive engagement: Networked theology
Campbell’s most explicit theological turn appears in **Networked Theology: Negotiating Faith in Digital Culture** 2016 coauthored with **Stephen Garner**. Here the descriptive insights of **networked religion** and **RSST** are brought into conversation with Christian doctrines of creation, incarnation, and church. The authors argue that Christians must practice **discernment** within digital culture by asking how technologies align with or deform creaturely **relationality** and **imago Dei** vocation. They commend practices of Sabbath, attentiveness, and community rule-making as counter-liturgies to platform logics, while affirming the goods of connectivity for mission and pastoral care. Crucially, they stress that theology must be done with media, recognizing that doctrinal reception is already shaped by the forms through which it is communicated, a point consonant with **mediatization theory**.

Nevertheless, Campbell retains a disciplined modesty about theological normativity. Her work supplies stable analytic concepts and case-guided prudence, but she resists prescribing single-path solutions for contested issues such as online **sacramentality**. The result is a framework that invites confessional traditions to apply **RSST** and **networked religion** to their own doctrinal commitments. The significance here is methodological: Campbell identifies how theological judgment must reckon with **affordances**, **platform governance**, and **algorithmic authority**, lest doctrine be abstracted from the actual conditions of its performance and reception in late-modern life.

#### 9. Assessment and Reformed or WTS evaluation
Heidi A. Campbell’s enduring contribution is a robust, transferable lexicon and method for analyzing **digital religion** as a socially shaped, networked, and authority-reconfiguring practice. Through **RSST**, **networked religion**, and attention to **algorithmic authority**, she shows how religious communities actively translate technologies into the grammar of **tradition**, **identity**, and **practice**. Her corpus from **Exploring Religious Community Online** 2005 to **Digital Creatives and the Rethinking of Religious Authority** 2020 and **The Distanced Church** 2020 gives theologians reliable maps for negotiating the platform turn, while **Networked Theology** 2016 opens pathways for constructive reflection on discipleship, witness, and institutional resilience in mediatized cultures.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, the strengths and limits can be stated in principled contrasts focused on revelation, church, and means. Positively, Campbell’s **RSST** honors creaturely **secondary causality** and providential ordering, resisting both technological determinism and ecclesial voluntarism. Her typology of **shifting authority** helps Reformed ecclesiology name how **offices** and **courts of the church** relate to emergent digital voices, and her **convergent practice** lens aids prudential judgments about catechesis and diaconal communication. Yet tensions appear where descriptive mediations risk becoming tacit norms. Classical Reformed commitments to **Word and sacrament** as the ordinary **means of grace**, the **regulative principle of worship**, and the primacy of embodied assembly press a harder line than Campbell’s open-ended posture on online rites. A Reformed alternative would appropriate her **affordance** analysis while reasserting that ecclesial form is not infinitely plastic: the preached **Word** must be audible in gathered time, and the **sacraments** require bodily sharing as covenantal signs and seals, with digital media serving as pedagogical supplement not liturgical substitution. Likewise, **algorithmic authority** must be subordinated to ordained ministry under Scripture, such that platform metrics cannot adjudicate doctrinal truth or pastoral legitimacy. In sum, a Reformed reading welcomes Campbell’s diagnostic brilliance and field-shaping clarity, but it recalibrates practice through confessional norms about revelation’s form, covenantal worship, and shepherding that resist platform logics even as they engage them wisely under God’s providence.
