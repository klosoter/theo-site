### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The work of **Jeffrey P. Bishop** emerges at the intersection of clinical practice, philosophical critique, and theological retrieval, written against the broader backdrop of late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century **biomedicine** in North America and Europe. Trained as both physician and philosopher, and long based at **Saint Louis University** in health care ethics, Bishop writes as a participant observer within the world he interrogates. His signature thesis, distilled in **The Anticipatory Corpse** in 2011, is that modern medicine operates within a **medical cosmology** ordered toward control of the body under the aspect of death. The living patient is viewed implicitly as a corpse-in-waiting, an object of manipulation whose meaning is delivered by the laboratory, the ICU, and the policy apparatus of **biopolitics**. Methodologically Bishop combines **Foucault’s** genealogical suspicion, **Heidegger’s** analysis of technology as enframing, and an **Aristotelian-Thomistic** account of **final causality** and **virtue ethics**, arguing that the clinical habitus is shaped by a suppressed metaphysics. He thus brings **phenomenology** and **genealogy** under the discipline of teleology to unmask the tacit ends that form medical seeing and doing.

Bishop frames this project within concrete historical developments in **anatomy**, **pathology**, and **critical care** since the seventeenth century. The early modern turn, powered by **Francis Bacon’s** experimentalism and **Descartes’** mechanistic dualism, redirected medicine toward efficient causality and quantitative mastery. In Bishop’s account, the rise of the **anatomical gaze** and the centrality of the **cadaver** in medical education generated a clinical epistemology in which the truth of the body is first disclosed in death. This **mechanistic metaphysics** then meets the modern state’s interest in life management, what **Foucault** named **biopower**, producing the contemporary coupling of biomedical technique and public policy around aging, dying, and organ procurement.

#### 2. The anticipatory corpse and the logic of control
In **The Anticipatory Corpse** Bishop argues that the hospital’s practices are not neutral techniques but embodiments of an implicit **telos**: to anticipate and seize death for the sake of control. The ICU, with ventilators, infusion pumps, and invasive monitoring, trains clinicians to read living bodies as systems tending to failure, which must be forestalled, optimized, and, when failure arrives, incorporated into a manageable narrative. The **autopsy** and the laboratory have pride of place as arbiters of meaning, displacing the lived experience of suffering with physiological data. This **epistemology of objectification** is not simply a mistake in knowledge; it is the practical outworking of a worldview in which the body’s final truth is its decomposability. Bishop’s genealogical chapters connect these practices to the political rationalities of **administrative medicine**, where outcomes, quality metrics, and resource allocation complete the arc from ontological reduction to managerial governance.

The phrase **anticipatory corpse** captures both the metaphysical and the moral. Metaphysically, medicine construes the body as a material machine ordered by efficient causes, dissolving **final causality** and the agent’s goods. Morally, clinicians and systems live toward the moment where death is either postponed or authorized, and in both cases narrated as success: either the triumph of technological delay or the triumph of autonomous choice. Bishop’s **Heideggerian** register names this as **Gestell**, the enframing that turns patients into standing-reserve. His **Thomistic** register names it as failure to recognize the **anima forma corporis**, the soul as form of the body, and thus the irreducible unity of the person whose goods cannot be read from cadaveric structures alone.

#### 3. Brain death, organ transplantation, and biopolitics
Bishop’s most sustained case work explores the definition of **brain death** and its relation to **organ transplantation**, policy, and ontology. He tracks the political-theoretical dynamics from the **1981 Uniform Determination of Death Act** through the debates crystallized in the **2008 President’s Council on Bioethics** report Controversies in the Determination of Death. His analysis is unflinching: the criteria for declaring death were and remain entangled with the needs of transplantation systems and the governance of scarce resources. Bishop highlights the oscillation between biological and functional accounts, showing how definitions shift to secure social ends. The result is a practice-first ontology where the fact of death is calibrated to procedural utility. This is **biopolitics** in Foucault’s sense: the state’s interest in regulating life and death feeding back into the conceptual apparatus of medicine.

Here Bishop contrasts a **policy-driven pragmatism** with a robust **metaphysical realism**. He is not naive about the need for criteria in plural societies. His point is that medicine’s current apparatus cannot retrieve an account of the person sufficient to bear the normative weight. The death criteria debates reveal a habit of reasoning that is instrumental, technocratic, and system-facing, not teleologically oriented to the goods of the patient as a unified rational animal. The **anticipatory corpse** is visible in the way a not-yet-dead body is read through the lens of future utility: potential donor, potential bed availability, potential quality metrics. The very grammar of clinical reasoning has been shaped by the metaphysics of control that the anatomical and policy regimes presuppose.

#### 4. Palliative care, the good death, and the politics of autonomy
Bishop’s critique extends into **palliative care** and the contemporary rhetoric of the **good death**. He is grateful for palliative medicine’s recovery of symptom control and relational care, yet he warns that hospice can be colonized by the same **technocratic rationality** it sought to resist. When palliative pathways are organized by the primacy of **autonomy**, **advance directives**, and quality-of-life metrics, they can stage-manage dying in conformity with the anticipatory logic: death becomes an event to be planned and optimized. Practices like deep palliative sedation can be framed, and sometimes are, within a paradigm of control that mirrors the ICU. The result, Bishop argues, is a sanitization that appears humane but still crowds out a thicker moral and spiritual account of dying as a human act with communal and transcendent dimensions.

Against this, Bishop retrieves a **teleological** understanding of the **ends of medicine**: to restore, when possible, the patient to the goods of human flourishing, and when not, to accompany the patient in truthful dependence ordered to the good. Drawing from **Aquinas** on the cardinal virtues and **amicitia** as medicinal friendship, he contends that the practice of medicine is sustained by **virtue ethics** more than by rules, and by attention to **giftedness** more than by control. Here the idiom of **Augustine** also surfaces: the human heart is restless until it rests in God, so the good death cannot be architected by technique or autonomy alone. Medicine must relearn to serve goods it cannot command, and to support practices it cannot own, such as forgiveness, reconciliation, lament, and hope.

#### 5. Neuroscience, enhancement, and the horizons of personhood
While end-of-life care is Bishop’s proving ground, he also engages **neuroscience**, **psychiatry**, and the allure of **enhancement**. He argues that neuroreductionist idioms, in which mind is redescribed entirely in terms of neural plasticity, threaten to reify personhood as a manipulable substrate for policy and market imperatives. The rhetoric of cognitive enhancement, along with the medicalization of ordinary distress, signals a further extension of **biopower** from the ICU to the schoolroom and workplace. Here Bishop again deploys **genealogy** to show how claims about the brain’s authority often smuggle in normative ideals of productivity and normalization. The **mechanistic metaphysics** that governed anatomy is reborn as a computationalist picture of the self, with corresponding shifts in medicine’s self-understanding from healing to optimization.

Bishop’s response is not Luddite resistance but metaphysical correction: persons are embodied rational animals whose goods are teleologically ordered and socially embedded. A **Thomistic** account of **form** and **finality** resists the fragmentation of the person into brain-modules. And a **MacIntyrean** vision of practices sustains the claim that medicine, as a practice with internal goods and standards of excellence, must resist commodification. The language of **telos** does the heavy lifting, re-situating empirical advances within a larger account of the human that can say no when the proposed interventions deform rather than perfect our nature.

#### 6. Theological anthropology and the meaning of death
The theological horizon of Bishop’s project is modest in ecclesial claim yet substantive in doctrinal grammar. He works with **Christian theological anthropology** to assert the unity of body and soul, the grievous reality of death as the last enemy, and the hope anchored in the **resurrection of the body**. The **anima forma corporis** serves not only as a metaphysical claim but as a clinical corrective: you do not care rightly for a person by treating the living as if already dead. Likewise, the moral imagination of **gift** stands over against the voluntarist imagination of autonomy. Life is received, not manufactured; we steward but do not possess ourselves.

Within this horizon Bishop can say that the medical calling is ministerial. Medicine serves goods it does not invent and must be chastened by the primacy of **charity** and **truth-telling** about limits. This is why he commends practices such as presence, prayer, confession, anointing, and communal accompaniment, not as optional religious add-ons but as enactments of a more truthful **medical cosmology**. The anticipatory corpse is unmasked by the eschatological promise that the dead are not reducible to raw material and that even the dying can enact meaningful acts of love, reconciliation, and hope. That is a theological protest against the closed world of technique.

#### 7. Method rearticulated: genealogy in service of teleology
A distinctive feature of Bishop’s method is the subordination of **genealogy** to **teleology**. Genealogy alone can end in cynicism. By placing **Foucault** and **Heidegger** in the service of **Aquinas** and **Aristotle**, Bishop sustains critical distance without forfeiting normative judgment. The four causes reappear as a diagnostic tool: medicine absolutizes **efficient causality** and quantification, neglecting **formal** and **final** causes. Restoring the full causal grammar enables a differentiation of means and ends: ventilators, vasopressors, and sedatives are not self-interpreting. Their meaning depends on a judgment about the good of this patient within a form of life aimed at goods beyond mere biological continuation.

This meta-method yields practical payoffs in clinical ethics. It underwrites a critique of **principlism** when the four principles are treated as algorithmic constraints, and it defends **virtue** as the mode by which clinicians perceive morally salient features. It reframes **informed consent** as a necessary but insufficient aspect of the patient-physician relationship, to be embedded within **practical wisdom** and shared pursuit of the good. And it cautions against **policy fundamentalism**, where guidelines displace judgment. Bishop’s persistent claim is that medicine’s most intractable disputes are arguments about ends carried on in the idiom of means.

#### 8. Interlocutors, reception, and contribution
Bishop’s interlocutors are both philosophical and clinical. He learns from **Alasdair MacIntyre** that practices have internal goods and from **Stanley Hauerwas** that the church’s virtues can form medicine without triumphalism. He disputes **secular bioethics** when it narrows moral reason to autonomy and utility, and he engages the clinical tradition through figures like **Eric Cassell** on suffering and the limitations of disease-reductionism. Policy interlocutors include the **Hastings Center** and governmental advisory bodies, particularly in debates about **brain death** and **organ transplantation**. Across these exchanges Bishop’s distinctive voice is to show how metaphysics hides in practice and how practice shapes metaphysics. The **anticipatory corpse** concept has been taken up widely in medical humanities, in critiques of ICU culture, and in theological bioethics seeking to resist the bureaucratization of dying.

His influence is institutional as well as textual. As a leading figure at **Saint Louis University** in **health care ethics**, Bishop has mentored a generation of scholars who bring **teleology**, **virtue**, and **biopolitics** into productive tension. While some critics worry that his genealogical narratives overdraw the continuity between early modern anatomy and contemporary policy regimes, even they concede that the rhetoric of control requires countervailing narratives of gift and limit. Bishop’s contribution is to render those narratives academically credible and clinically resonant, showing that metaphysics is already at work each time we write an order for vasopressors or sign a DNR.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Bishop’s analysis of **instrumental rationality**, his chastening of **autonomy**, and his defense of **creaturely limits** are deeply congenial. His exposure of **biopower** accords with a covenantal account of human life as lived under God’s lordship rather than under technocratic sovereignty. Yet tensions remain. First, his **Thomistic nature-grace** framework risks granting too much stability to natural teleology apart from **special revelation**, where a Reformed account would insist that the noetic effects of sin deform even medicine’s best practices and require explicit **Word-governed** correction. Second, his virtue-centered account can appear to lean on **habitus** without sufficiently grounding moral knowledge in **covenant** and **law-gospel** dynamics, which better articulate how dying well is grace-enabled rather than simply artfully practiced. Third, his ecclesial proposals, while welcome, could be clarified by a **two-kingdoms** or **common-grace** account that distinguishes but coordinates churchly care and civil medicine. A Reformed alternative would press further: medicine’s **telos** is service to neighbor under the **imago Dei** and within the **creation-fall-redemption** economy, so clinical norms must be normed not only by teleology but by Scripture’s eschatological claim that death is an enemy conquered in Christ, reorienting consent, policy, and practice toward truthful hope rather than anticipatory control.
