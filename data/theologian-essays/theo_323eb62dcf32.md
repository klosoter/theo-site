### ESSAY
Richard J. Mouw emerges from the Dutch-American **Reformed** world as a late twentieth-century interpreter of **Abraham Kuyper** for the evangelical and global academy, a theologian whose signature contribution is the retrieval and refinement of **common grace** for a fractured public square. Born in 1940 and educated in the guild of analytic **philosophy** at the **University of Chicago**, Mouw taught at **Calvin College** before moving to **Fuller Seminary**, where he served as president from 1993 to 2013. Those institutional locations matter: the **Christian Reformed** colleges formed his instincts in **sphere sovereignty** and **creation-fall-redemption**, while Fuller placed him at the crossroads of **evangelicalism**, ecumenical dialogue, and post-1960s cultural resets. The Cold War’s denouement, the rise of **liberal proceduralism** and **identity pluralism**, and the crisis of evangelical public witness set the historical stage for Mouw’s twin emphases on **convicted civility** and a theologically thick account of **the saeculum** under God’s **providentia**.

Methodologically, Mouw fuses a **Kuyperian** ontology of culture with **Augustinian** moral realism and a chastened **divine command theory**. From **Calvin** and **Bavinck** he receives the grammar of **general revelation** and **common grace**; from **Dooyeweerd** and **Kuyper** the structural differentiation of social life into God-ordered spheres; from **Wolterstorff** and **Plantinga** the confidence that **basic beliefs** can be rational without classical **foundationalism**. Yet unlike some **Reformed epistemology**, Mouw accentuates a public-facing virtue he calls **convicted civility**: Christians should enter shared spaces with clear **Christian confession** and a practiced courtesy that honors the **imago Dei** in all. This entails a translational posture toward **public reason** without capitulating to **Rawlsian** strictures. Theologically, he insists that the Creator continues to gift a fallen world with **non-salvific goods**, enabling collaboration on proximate justice while retaining the **antithesis** at the level of ultimate allegiance.

Mouw’s early program is sketched in **Political Evangelism** (1973), which challenged evangelical quietism by arguing that **gospel proclamation** and **public justice** are integrally related under the **lordship of Christ**. He rejected both pietist withdrawal and ideologized activism, recommending **principled pluralism** as a public philosophy consonant with **sphere sovereignty**. This stream fed into **When the Kings Come Marching In** (1983), a slender but programmatic biblical-theological meditation in which **Isaiah 60** and **Revelation 21–22** construe history under the **regnum Christi**. Mouw advances an **eschatological transformation** thesis: the cultural labors of the nations, purged of idolatry, are brought into the New Jerusalem. This exegetical vision underwrites a theologically serious account of the **cultural mandate**, neither sacralizing the world’s achievements nor dismissing their potential translatability into the economy of **consummation**.

Ethically, **The God Who Commands** (1990) articulates Mouw’s version of **divine command theory**, interacting with contemporary analytic moral philosophy, including figures like **Robert Merrihew Adams** and **Philip Quinn**. Mouw defends the primacy of God’s communicative authority for moral normativity while insisting that the Creator’s commands resonate with the natures and ends of creatures as given in **creation order**. He is wary of a Thomistic **natural law** construed as an autonomous moral ontology, yet he affirms **lex naturalis** insofar as it witnesses to **general revelation** preserved by **common grace**. The result is an ethic that grounds obligation in God’s speech while recognizing that believers and unbelievers can share actionable moral knowledge about justice, marriage, and economic fairness because God maintains the world in a state of preserved though perverted good.

The interpersonal face of this project surfaces in **Uncommon Decency** (1992; revised 2010), where Mouw coins and defends **convicted civility**. He engages **Niebuhr’s** realism and **Rawls’s** idea of public reason, critiquing the latter’s neutrality claim while appropriating the former’s sober assessment of power and sin. Civility becomes, for Mouw, a Christian virtue woven from **charity**, **truthfulness**, and **hope**, grounded in the **imago Dei** and animated by **common grace**. The book frames a set of practices for discourse across difference, functioning as a theology of speech in the **public square** that avoids both sectarian **sectarianism** and flaccid **relativism**. Mouw’s civility is not a politeness ethic but a habit of honoring other agents as recipients of God’s preserving gifts, so that persuasion aims at genuine moral negotiation within a **principled pluralist** polity.

The constructive heart of Mouw’s contribution is the retrieval of **common grace** in **He Shines in All That’s Fair** (2001). The title deliberately evokes the hymn line to press a theological question: can we say that God takes delight in the art, justice, and love of those who are not regenerate. Mouw argues yes, distinguishing carefully between **saving grace** and **common grace** while drawing on **Herman Bavinck’s** multi-angled doctrine of God’s positive evaluation of created goods. Here he develops notions like “shared moral spaces” and “divine delight in penultimate goods” and rehearses the classic **synod of 1924** in the **Christian Reformed Church** on common grace. The upshot is an account of cultural cooperation, aesthetic praise, and political compromise that is chastened by the **noetic effects of sin** yet confident that God’s **providence** furnishes genuine, though not ultimate, common goods. This exploration sets him in conversation with **Van Tilian antithesis** arguments and also with **Two Kingdoms** proposals, from which he borrows a salutary distinction between **cultic** and **civil** righteousness while declining their more radical compartmentalization.

Alongside these programmatic texts, Mouw authored works that extend his project into the textures of ecclesial and popular life. **Consulting the Faithful** (1994) critiques the pretensions of elite **intellectuals** and commends attentive listening to **popular religion** as a site of **sensus fidelium** within a Protestant key. **The Smell of Sawdust** (2000) revisits the **fundamentalist** heritage with appreciative critique, arguing that **evangelical** affect and altar-call piety can be chastened without being despised. **Calvinism in the Las Vegas Airport** (2004) is catechetical public theology, presenting **providence**, **election**, and **vocation** in colloquial idiom for seekers and skeptics in late modernity. **Praying at Burger King** (2007) models a spirituality of ordinary places consonant with **Kuyper’s** famous line that Christ claims every square inch. Each of these volumes advances the same thesis: **Reformed** doctrine, rightly taught, generates a generous, culture-facing piety attuned to God’s **presence** in the ordinary.

Mouw also pressed **Kuyperian** insights into interreligious and civic dialogue. His longstanding conversations with **Latter-day Saints** culminated in **Talking with Mormons** (2012), where he urges **evangelicals** to address Mormonism with clarity and charity. A controversial episode in this trajectory was his public apology at the **Salt Lake Tabernacle** for evangelical misrepresentations of Mormon belief, which critics took as an ecumenical overreach. Mouw replied that **convicted civility** demands repentance for false witness even as it sustains forthright doctrinal disagreement over **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **grace**. Similarly, his institutional leadership at **Fuller Seminary** fostered dialogues with Catholics, Jews, and secular scholars, embodying a Kuyperian confidence that **common grace** licenses collaboration on housing policy, immigration, and religious freedom while guarding the church’s proclamation of **Christ’s exclusivity**.

Late-career works consolidate and nuance the themes of his earlier project. **Abraham Kuyper: A Short and Personal Introduction** (2011) offers a sympathetic but critical account of **Kuyper’s** genius and blind spots, emphasizing **sphere sovereignty**, **pillarization**, and the danger of baptizing cultural tribes. **Restless Faith** (2019) narrates Mouw’s journey through **evangelical** and **Reformed** worlds, resolving to inhabit a chastened orthodoxy that is globally attuned and socially engaged. **All That God Cares About** (2020) returns to **common grace** with a thicker account of divine **delight** and **grief** in the world, pressing toward an ethics of cultural participation that is penultimate, eschatologically hopeful, and sensitive to the complexities of late modern **pluralism**. Together these volumes display Mouw’s hallmark: the ability to pair **systematic** claims with pastoral and civic wisdom, rooted in **Calvin** and **Bavinck** yet conversant with **Rawls**, **Hauerwas**, and contemporary **public theology**.

At the doctrinal core, Mouw’s Reformed project features several interlocking commitments. First, a **doctrine of creation** robust enough to fund talk of intrinsic goods and stable natures, against voluntarist flattenings of **divine command** and against reductionist historicisms. Second, a serious **hamartiology** that names the **antithesis** in terms of idolatry and noetic distortion, thereby refusing naive optimism about cultural projects. Third, an account of **providence** and **common grace** that preserves the Creator’s benevolence toward the world he made, even as **special grace** in **Christ** remains the only path to reconciliation. Fourth, an **eschatology** in which **Isaiah 60** and **Revelation 21–22** authorize gratitude for penultimate achievements and temper any lust for cultural triumph. These are bound together by a public virtue of **civility** rooted in the **imago Dei** and ordered by **charity** and **truth**. Mouw’s sustained engagement with **Rawlsian** proceduralism yields a patient model of public translation, while his disputes with **Hauerwas** sharpen his claim that **principled pluralism** is neither Constantinian nor sectarian but an outworking of **sphere sovereignty** for democratic life.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. From a **Westminster** vantage, Mouw’s retrieval of **common grace** is a needed antidote to culture-war belligerence and a salutary witness to **creation’s goodness** under **providence**. Yet three tensions require calibration. First, his openness to shared moral knowledge, though grounded in **general revelation**, sometimes blurs the depth of the **noetic effects of sin** as emphasized by **Van Til**, risking an overconfidence in the stability of the moral *saeculum* apart from **special revelation** and **regeneration**. A classical alternative would keep **general revelation** but weight its clarity by **Romans 1** with stronger accent on suppression, deploying **general equity** of the moral law rather than soft **natural law** as the bridge for public reasoning. Second, his account of **convicted civility** can appear to treat civility as a near-independent norm, whereas **Reformed** ethics classically subordinates social virtues to the **first table** of the **Decalogue**; a Westminster calibration would foreground **worship** as the fountain of public speech while maintaining charity. Third, his **eschatological transformation** reading of **Isaiah 60** can encourage an over-ambitious cultural program; a two-kingdoms accent on the distinction between **cultic holiness** and **civil righteousness** would guard the church’s mission while still welcoming **common goods**. Properly tuned, Mouw’s **Kuyperian** vision enriches **Reformed** public theology: let **common grace** authorize real cooperation for proximate justice, let **antithesis** preserve doxological distinctiveness, and let **civility** be practiced as truth-telling love rather than as a technique for social acceptance.
