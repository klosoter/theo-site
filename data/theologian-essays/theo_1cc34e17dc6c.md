### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and Context: Evangelical Retrieval in a Pro-Nicene Key
Fred Sanders emerges as a leading voice in contemporary **evangelical theology** whose signature thesis that **the Trinity is the gospel** shapes a program of doctrinal retrieval oriented by **pro-Nicene** grammar and **biblical exegesis**. Trained in historical and systematic theology and teaching since the late 1990s at Biola University's **Torrey Honors College**, Sanders occupies a distinctive place in the ecology of American evangelicalism, combining **catechetical clarity** with **scholarly precision**. In a landscape marked by late twentieth-century debates between **social trinitarianism** and **classical theism**, by the legacies of **Barth** and **Rahner**, and by the diversifying streams of **broad evangelicalism**, Sanders presses a restorative project he calls **evangelical ressourcement**. That project mines patristic and medieval sources, stabilizes doctrine through **creedal** rules, and resubmits contemporary theology to **pro-Nicene dogmatics**. The institutional context matters: alongside **Oliver D. Crisp**, Sanders co-founded the **Los Angeles Theology Conference** in 2012, a venue that models doctrinal retrieval and analytic clarity, while platforming global voices in **Trinitarian** and **Christological** dogma.

Sanders's method distills a century of scholarly gains about patristic theology, especially those articulated by **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios** on **pro-Nicene** patterns, and refits them for evangelical ecclesial use. The decisive moves are three: first, an epistemic starting point in **the economy of salvation**, where **missions** disclose the **processions** of the Son and Spirit; second, a pledge to **inseparable operations** as a hermeneutical rule of divine action; third, a commitment to **appropriations** and the **doctrine of divine simplicity** to prevent tritheistic slides. By treating **the rule of faith** as Scripture's own interpretive environment, Sanders aligns evangelical biblicity with **dogmatic exegesis**, resisting both historicist reduction and speculative projection. The result is an approach neither biblicist nor traditionalist but a disciplined **canonical-credal** reading that places **Trinity and soteriology** in mutual illumination.

#### 2. Early Work: Rahner's Rule Under Evangelical Discipline
The monograph **The Image of the Immanent Trinity** (2005) sets the conceptual stage by interrogating **Karl Rahner's Rule**: the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa. Sanders affirms the rule as an anti-separation axiom yet construes it within **pro-Nicene** convictions about **eternal generation** and **eternal procession**. He contends that evangelical theology must receive Rahner's insight under the grammar of **processions grounding missions**, not as a license to collapse **ad intra** into **ad extra**. This requires a renewed stress on **inseparable operations** and the taxis of Father, Son, and Spirit. The eternal **paternity**, **filiation**, and **spiration** are not deduced from historical roles but are recognized as the deep rationale of the gospel's **missions** that display what is true *aeternaliter*. Sanders thus secures **Rahner's Rule** by reinstating its **pro-Nicene** controls, especially **divine simplicity** and **homoousios**, so that evangelical proclamation about salvation by **the Father through the Son in the Spirit** coheres with classical descriptions of God's triune life.

This early engagement with **Rahner** foreshadows Sanders's lifelong pattern of critical retrieval: he refuses **Barthian** subsumption of all dogmatics under **Christology** if it threatens **triune taxis**, yet he learns from **Barth** the disciplined practice of starting from **revelation** in Scripture. He resists modern **social trinitarianism** when it treats **person** analogically after human models, but he welcomes insights about **communion** and **mission** provided they are bound to **inseparable operations**. At each turn, Sanders steers between **historicist** identification of God with history and **rationalist** speculation apart from history, maintaining that only the **economy** grounded in **eternal processions** displays God to be who God eternally is.

#### 3. The Deep Things of God: Catechesis in Trinity and Salvation
With **The Deep Things of God** (2010; rev. ed. 2017), Sanders translated a scholarly retrieval into evangelical catechesis through the bold claim that **the Trinity is the gospel**. The book insists that to preach grace in **justification** and **adoption** is to preach the **Triune God**, and to pray and read **Scripture** as evangelicals do is already to inhabit **trinitarian** patterns. Sanders argues that the shape of salvation is **from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit**, a rendering of **inseparable operations** that simultaneously safeguards **the unity of essence** and **the distinctions of persons**. The heart of the book is not an abstract proof but an evangelical spiritual theology: assurance, Scripture reading, prayer, and mission are enacted confessions of **eternal generation** and **eternal procession** because they presuppose access to the Father through the Son by the Spirit.

The didactic power of **The Deep Things of God** lies in recoding evangelical piety along **pro-Nicene** lines while preserving its **gospel** idiom. Sanders shows how doctrines like **union with Christ**, **indwelling of the Spirit**, and the believers **adoption** are not detachable benefits but participations in the Son's filial relation and the Spirit's gift. He warns against functional **unitarianism** in devotional life and exposes unwitting **tritheism** in worship language, returning repeatedly to **appropriations** and **inseparable operations** as pastoral guardrails. By integrating **soteriology** and **Trinity**, he re-centers evangelicalism's doctrinal core without displacing its missionary urgency or its **Scripture principle**.

#### 4. The Triune God: Pro-Nicene Grammar for Systematic Theology
Sanders's technical statement arrives in **The Triune God** (2016) in the New Studies in Dogmatics series. There he synthesizes the scholarship of **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios** to outline **pro-Nicene theology** as a coherent dogmatic system: **divine simplicity**, **homoousios**, and **inseparable operations** joined to **eternal relations of origin** and **taxis**. The book begins with **revelation** and the **missions** of Son and Spirit in Scripture, then ascends to confess **processions** as the principled explanation of those missions. Sanders crafts his via media between **exegetical theology** and **classical metaphysics** by reasserting that the canonical pattern of salvation is the surest pathway to **immanent** description. He insists that **opera Trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt** means that all divine acts are the one God's acts, yet they are ordered by **hypostatic** relations, so that the sending of the Son really is the sending of the Son.

The volume also addresses contested topics like **eternal generation**, **eternal functional subordination**, and **immanent authority structures**. Sanders rejects the attempt to encode **subordination** as an eternal personal property, because it confuses **mission** with **procession** and violates **inseparable operations**. He recovers **eternal generation** through exegetical and historical arguments, showing how Scripture's **monogenes** witness and the Fathers' reasoning converge. With theological economy, he deploys **appropriations** to explain why Scripture names the Father as sender and the Son as sent without fracturing **divine simplicity**. The resulting dogmatics is unmistakably **classical** but richly scriptural, resisting contemporary **social trinitarian** and **process trinitarian** innovations while welcoming biblical-theological texture.

#### 5. Retrieval in Debate: Eternal Generation and the 2016 Trinitarian Controversy
Sanders's voice became strategic during the 2016 evangelical debate over **eternal functional subordination**. In a series of essays and chapters culminating in the edited volume **Retrieving Eternal Generation** (2017, with **Scott R. Swain**), he argued that the proper evangelical way forward is not to fashion new **immanent** hierarchies but to retrieve **eternal relations of origin**. The goal was to stabilize evangelical talk about **Father** and **Son** in terms of **processions** without importing **temporal economy** into the divine life. Sanders offered a positive program: affirm the Scripture-saturated, **pro-Nicene** doctrine of **eternal generation**, confess **inseparable operations**, and employ **appropriations** to interpret asymmetrical biblical predicates. He also clarified that doctrinally significant asymmetry is **taxis**, not authority, and that the Son's incarnate obedience is a property of the **hypostatic union**, not an **ad intra** subordination.

The debate became an object lesson in Sanders's broader method of **evangelical ressourcement**. Rather than escalate partisan rhetoric, he urged a patient return to **Athanasius**, **Gregory of Nazianzus**, **Augustine**, and **Aquinas**, as well as careful exegesis of Johannine and Pauline texts. In doing so, Sanders helped reset the evangelical conversation around **pro-Nicene** standards and re-secured the status of **eternal generation** in evangelical confessional life. The episode exposed the wider need for catechesis about **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, and the distinction between **missions** and **processions**, themes that Sanders had already staged in **The Triune God** and **The Deep Things of God**.

#### 6. Trinity and Soteriology: Adoption, Participation, and the Gift-Giving God
At the heart of Sanders's project is a soteriological ontology governed by **triune processions**. Salvation is participation by grace, not nature, in the Son's filial life through the Spirit's indwelling, a pattern that binds **union with Christ** and **adoption** to **eternal generation** and **eternal procession**. When he says **the Trinity is the gospel**, Sanders intends that the shape of redemptive history is the public enactment of who God eternally is, without remainder. The **Father** sent the **Son** to accomplish redemption and the **Spirit** to apply it, one work with distinct **hypostatic** inflections. This pattern regulates the **ordo salutis** as evangelical piety knows it: **effectual calling**, **justification**, **sanctification**, and **glorification** unfold as a single movement from the **fountain of deity** in the Father, through the **consubstantial Son**, in the **Gift who is the Spirit**.

Sanders's soteriology is not speculative. He consistently locates doctrines like **assurance**, **illumination**, and **sanctification** in the triune life. He urges evangelicals to interpret the **means of grace** as the Spirit's instruments of filial communion, to understand **Scripture** as the Spirit's public testimony to the Son for the Father's glory, and to receive **baptism** and **the Lord's Supper** as trinitarian acts of incorporation and nourishment. He resists **deification** schemes that blur the Creator-creature line but affirms a robust participation by adoption, calibrated by **incommunicable attributes** such as **simplicity** and **aseity**. Across this field, **inseparable operations** furnishes the controlling motif that prevents fragmenting salvation into competing personal realms.

#### 7. Ecclesial Identity: Wesleyan Evangelical, Pro-Nicene Catholicity
Although Sanders is a **Wesleyan evangelical**, his theological identity is profoundly **catholic** in the sense of rootedness in the **creeds** and **pro-Nicene** dogma. In **Wesley on the Christian Life** (2013), he interprets **John Wesley's** spirituality of love and holiness within a trinitarian and doctrinally classical horizon. He highlights the centrality of **adoption** and **sanctification** as Spirit-enabled participation in the Son's obedience, aligning **Wesleyan** themes with **pro-Nicene** ontology. This move models his broader conviction that evangelical spirituality should be doctrinally thick, and that holiness is a **trinitarian** reality before it is a moral program.

Sanders's ecclesial work is institutional and pedagogical. Through **LATC** volumes on topics like **Christology** and **atonement**, he showcases retrieval in conversation with global scholarship, including **analytic theology** and **biblical theology**. His public scholarship at Scriptorium Daily and in denominational settings performs **catechesis** in **divine simplicity**, **eternal generation**, and **inseparable operations** for pastors and laypeople. In this way he enacts a vision of **evangelical catholicity** where doctrinal orthodoxy is not an academic luxury but the grammar of worship and mission, advancing a churchly renewal through **pro-Nicene** instruction.

#### 8. Interlocutors and Methodological Commitments: Scripture, Rule, and Metaphysics
Methodologically, Sanders mediates between **biblical studies** and **systematic theology** by insisting that Scripture is read within the **rule of faith**, not over against it. He rejects **historicism** that would reduce **homoousios** to a fourth-century construct devoid of hermeneutical force, and he resists **rationalism** that would derive trinities from philosophical triads. Instead he draws on **Augustine** and **Aquinas** to acknowledge the necessity of **metaphysical** clarity, especially **divine simplicity**, while calibrating those claims to Scripture's salvation history. He uses the scholastic distinction of *ad intra* and *ad extra* to maintain the Creator-creature distinction and to honor **inseparable operations**, yet he avoids making that distinction a barrier to seeing in the **economy** the truthful display of **processions**.

Sanders also engages modern theologians with critical charity. With **Barth**, he shares a determination to let **revelation** govern dogmatics, but he protests any collapse of **triune taxis** into **Christology** that might erode **paternity** and **spiration**. With **Rahner**, he accepts the corrective against **deism** but tightens the screws with **pro-Nicene** grammar so that **missions** disclose **processions** without identity collapse. He resists **Moltmann's** social trinitarian program, not because communion is untrue but because **social models** too easily assign discrete parts of the one work to different persons, violating **inseparable operations**. Across these engagements, the goal is not eclecticism but a coherent **evangelical dogmatics** marked by catholic substance and biblical felicity.

#### 9. Ongoing Contributions: Education, Editing, and Doctrinal Consolidation
Beyond monographs, Sanders's co-editing of **Retrieving Eternal Generation** with **Scott R. Swain** and multiple **LATC** volumes has shepherded a generation of evangelicals back to **pro-Nicene** orthodoxy. He has helped normalize the vocabulary of **eternal relations of origin**, **taxis**, and **appropriations** in seminaries and churches where such terms had faded. His clarifications on topics like **inseparable operations** and the proper interpretation of **monogenes** have been widely received across denominational lines. Whether in classrooms, conferences, or essays, he repeats the same core pedagogy: the way to speak of God is to follow the **missions** to their **processional** depths, to guard unity with **divine simplicity**, and to confess the glory of the one **homoousios** God in three **hypostases**.

This consolidation has practical effects. Preachers catechized by Sanders are less likely to commit **tritheist** slips in prayers or to instrumentalize the **Spirit** as an independent agent of post-gospel power. They are more likely to ground **assurance** in the **triune** work, to interpret **baptism** as incorporation into the Son through the Spirit for the Father's name, and to see **Scripture** as God's own triune discourse. The result is not a new system but a deepening of evangelical common sense into **pro-Nicene catholicity**, a marriage of **gospel proclamation** with **doctrinal precision** whose anchor remains the refrain that **the Trinity is the gospel**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS Evaluation: Agreements and Tensions Under Classical Dogma
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Sanders's retrieval of **classical theism**, **eternal generation**, **inseparable operations**, and **divine simplicity** represents exemplary alignment with **Reformed orthodoxy** in the doctrine of God. His method of moving **from missions to processions** and his disciplined use of **appropriations** comport with **Calvin's autotheos** emphasis as clarified within **Nicene** grammar, even if he does not foreground **autotheos** as a polemical theme. Reformed readers will appreciate his subordination of contemporary **social trinitarianism** to **pro-Nicene** dogmatics and his refusal of eternal **subordinationist** schemes, positions that strengthen confessional fidelity to the **Westminster Confession's** teaching on the **Trinity**. Yet tensions remain at loci downstream of the divine life. As a **Wesleyan**, Sanders accents **sanctification** and the **means of grace** in ways not organized by **covenant theology**, and he does not consistently treat **effectual calling**, **definite atonement**, or **sacramental efficacy** as structured by the **covenant of grace**. His account of **participation** by adoption could be more explicitly tethered to the Reformed **federal** shape of union with Christ, and his ecclesial practice remains **low-church**, with little attention to **means of grace** as covenantally administered. None of these are contradictions of **pro-Nicene** commitments, but they reveal programmatic differences in how **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, and **history** are integrated in **Reformed scholastic** systems. A Reformed constructive alternative would appropriate Sanders's **triune dogmatics** while relocating **soteriology** within **covenantal federalism**, intensifying the **Scripture principle** by the **analogia fidei** of confessional standards, and elaborating **Christ's mediatorial work** in **penal substitution** as the mission that most luminously reveals **processions** without eclipsing **divine simplicity**.
