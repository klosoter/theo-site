### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Mark Jones belongs to the cohort of contemporary **Reformed pastors** who write with scholarly range yet ministerial intent, deploying **Puritan retrieval** to navigate the fissures of twenty-first-century evangelicalism. His vocational locus in **Vancouver** situates his work at a crossroads of global, urban, and post-Christian realities, while his readership reflects the Anglophone appetite for **Reformed confessional** resources. The broader intellectual context includes renewed interest in **Reformed scholasticism**, the **Westminster Standards**, and classical dogmatics against the backdrop of debates on **sanctification**, **law and gospel**, and **classical theism**. Jones’s method is unabashedly ressourcement-driven: a return to **seventeenth-century Reformed orthodoxy** in conversation with Scripture, employing **scholastic distinctions** such as the *ad intra* and *ad extra* works of God, the **duplex gratia** of justification and sanctification, and precise formulations of **Christ’s mediatorial obedience**. This combination of historical precision and pastoral application characterizes his voice among contemporary **Reformed theologians** and anchors his abiding thesis that doctrinal clarity fuels spiritual vitality.

At the epistemic level, Jones presumes the normativity of **Scripture** read within the ecclesial grammar of the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, the **Larger Catechism**, and their Puritan interpretive tradition. His use of **distinguo** is not academic ornament but a pastoral instrument for casuistry in the tradition of **William Perkins** and **Richard Baxter**, though more consistently aligned with the doctrinal guardrails of **Owen** and **Goodwin**. With a historical-theological backbone formed by sustained work on **Puritan Christology** and **covenant theology**, Jones’s method retrieves patristic and scholastic insights into **Christ’s person and work**, **divine attributes**, and **union with Christ**, resisting reductionist biblicism or doctrinal minimalism. In sum, his self-conscious **Reformed scholastic** posture weds **doctrine** to **devotion**, convinced that the grammar of classical orthodoxy produces resilient holiness.

#### 2. Major works and the grid of Puritan retrieval
Jones’s co-authored **A Puritan Theology: Doctrine for Life** 2012 signaled a programmatic agenda: mapping the dogmatic loci of the Puritans to commend a resilient **Reformed orthodoxy** for the church. The volume canvasses **Trinity**, **Christology**, **covenant theology**, **law and gospel**, **justification**, **sanctification**, and **piety**, thereby establishing the terrain that Jones plows in subsequent monographs. His **Antinomianism: Reformed Theology’s Unwelcome Guest?** 2013 emerged amid controversies in North American Reformed circles, contending that classic **Reformed theology** affirms both the **free justification by imputed righteousness** and the necessity of **Spirit-wrought obedience** as the fruit of **union with Christ**. In this framing, **law and gospel** are distinguishable yet not adversarial, harmonized in the **covenant of grace** without collapsing into **neonomianism**.

The scholarly cornerstone is **Why Heaven Kissed Earth: The Christology of the Puritans** 2013, where Jones reconstructs the **Puritan account of the mediator** with attention to **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, the **communicatio idiomatum**, and the **extra Calvinisticum**. He shows how Puritans like **Goodwin** and **Owen** integrated **two-natures Christology** with the **munus triplex** and the **states of Christ** to produce a richly textured soteriology. This historical scaffolding undergirds later devotional syntheses, especially **Knowing Christ** 2015, which re-presents the **person and work of Christ** through accessible chapters organized around biblical titles, **mediatorial offices**, and the experiential knowledge of the Savior. Across these works, Jones fuses **scholastic clarity** and **pastoral warmth**, arguing that robust **Christology** is the fountainhead of **sanctification**.

#### 3. Law, gospel, and the antinomian-neonomian axis
The controversy targeted in **Antinomianism** 2013 turns on the Reformed grammar of **law and gospel** and the nature of **obedience** within the **covenant of grace**. Jones draws from **Luther**, **Calvin**, **Ursinus**, and **Turretin** to insist that the law is not an enemy post-justification but a guide in the **third use of the law**. He rejects a flattening tendency in some contemporary discourse that reduces sanctification to a reflex of justifying grace without an account of **mortification and vivification** or **Spirit-enabled duty**. Conversely, he also resists the drift toward **neonomianism**, which makes evangelical obedience a new meritorious principle. For Jones, the antidote lies in the Puritan orchestration of **union with Christ** where the duplex beneficium, **justification and sanctification**, are inseparable yet distinct, grounded in the **active and passive obedience of Christ** and animated by the **indwelling Spirit**.

In turning back to the seventeenth century, Jones recovers **Witsius’s** careful handling of **conditions** in the **covenant of grace**. He argues that terms like condition or instrument must be used with scholastic care, reserving **faith** as the sole instrument of **justification** while acknowledging that **repentance** and **obedience** function as necessary evidences and means in sanctification. He underscores confessional formulations such as **WCF 11** on justification and **WCF 16** on good works to secure the order of **grace and gratitude**. In this axis, the oft-cited phrase **judgment according to works** is retrieved as a biblical and confessional reality that neither competes with **sola fide** nor empties the stringent calls to holiness that saturate **Hebrews**, **James**, and **1 John**.

#### 4. Christ as mediator: person, offices, and states
The culminating center of Jones’s dogmatics is **Christology**. In **Why Heaven Kissed Earth** 2013 and **Knowing Christ** 2015, he develops classic **two-natures doctrine** under the Nicene and Chalcedonian banners, but transposes these into Puritan keys that stress the **mediatorial office**. He expounds the **munus triplex** as the structural plan of the mediator’s work: the **prophetic** revelation of God, the **priestly** satisfaction and intercession, and the **kingly** victory and rule. The **states of Christ**, *exinanitio* and *exaltatio*, are treated not as abstractions but as the living context for the believer’s participation in Christ’s benefits. In priestly key, Jones accentuates the **active obedience** that furnishes the law-keeping righteousness imputed in **justification**, and the **passive obedience** that satisfies divine justice, cohering with **Turretin’s** and **Owen’s** accounts.

Jones’s **The Prayers of Jesus** 2019 contributes a theologically rich but devotionally framed account of the **mediator’s prayer** across the Gospels and Hebrews. He explores **Hebrews 5:7** and the Savior’s learned obedience, maintaining **divine impassibility** in the Son’s deity while steeping Christ’s **human soul** in genuine passion, fear, and trust. Here the scholastic tools of **communicatio idiomatum** and **enhypostatic union** secure a non-competitive Christology where the Son as man truly prays, obeys, and suffers without impairment of the **immutability** and **impassibility** that belong to the Son’s divine nature. The result is a model of **piety** that is profoundly **Christocentric**, inviting believers to fellowship with a sympathetic High Priest.

#### 5. The doctrine of God and classical theism
With **God Is: A Devotional Guide to the Attributes of God** 2017, Jones joins the contemporary renewal of **classical theism** by retrieving **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **eternity** through the exegetical and doxological lens of the Puritans, especially **Stephen Charnock** and **John Owen**. The book functions as a guide to worship within the confessional grammar that secures the Creator-creature distinction. Against modern evangelical drift toward **theistic mutualism** or softened **impassibility**, Jones argues for the fullness of **actus purus** in God, careful to locate all change, suffering, and passion in the incarnate Son according to his **human nature**. This is not a retreat into metaphysics detached from Scripture but a deployment of patristic and scholastic grammar to read the Bible with the church.

The approach is unapologetically **catholic Reformed**. By tethering **divine attributes** to the **Trinity** and to **Christology**, Jones resists insular proof-texting and shows how **simplicity** undergirds the unity of God’s perfections, how **immutability** secures the stability of covenant promises, and how **impassibility** keeps the cross from being misread as divine suffering in the divine nature. Such retrieval serves his pastoral project: the weightiness of God yields the weightiness of grace, and thereby the weightiness of **sanctification**.

#### 6. Sin, sanctification, and the shape of holy living
Jones’s **Knowing Sin** 2022 tackles a neglected doctrine by harmonizing **hamartiology** with **sanctification**, echoing the Puritan anatomy of the soul. Drawing on **Owen’s** teaching on **indwelling sin** and **mortification**, he portrays sin as parasitic, deceptive, and habituating, requiring vigilant **self-examination** and constant recourse to **Christ** through the means of grace. He stresses the role of **the law** as mirror, pedagogue, and rule, while insisting that only the **Spirit’s union with Christ** produces durable repentance and new obedience.

Alongside, **Living for God** 2020 distills a rule of life anchored in **union with Christ**, the **means of grace**, and the **communion of saints**. Jones resists voluntarist moralism by subordinating every exhortation to the primacy of **grace** in the ordo salutis, yet he guards against quietism by insisting on **Spirit-enabled effort**. This balanced emphasis reflects confessional commitments in **WCF 13** on sanctification, **WLC 75-77** on repentance and assurance, and **WCF 16** on good works, producing a spirituality that is neither antinomian nor legalist but **evangelical** in the classic Reformed sense.

#### 7. Covenant theology and the ordo of grace
Central to Jones’s dogmatic map is **covenant theology**. He endorses the **covenant of works** with Adam, the **covenant of grace** post-fall, and the **pactum salutis** among the Trinity as the eternal ground of the mediator’s mission. Following **Witsius** and **Turretin**, he employs the **works/grace** contrast to protect the alien righteousness of **Christ’s obedience**, while presenting the **new covenant** as the gracious economy where the law is written on hearts by the **Spirit**. His emphasis on **conditions** must be read within this architecture: the **instrumental condition** of faith for justification stands alone, while the **evangelical conditions** of repentance and obedience qualify as necessary, non-meritorious means of fellowship in sanctification. In public interventions, he has affirmed **judgment according to works**, locating it in the biblical and confessional affirmations that divine judgment is public, evaluative, and integrally connected to **union with Christ**.

Jones is careful to register that the **law-gospel distinction** functions differently across redemptive history and within the believer’s experience. He retrieves the Puritan teaching that **Christ** as the second Adam fulfills the **covenant of works**, such that believers in him rest on a finished **merit** they could never provide, even as they are enabled to a sincere though imperfect **obedience** that will be openly acknowledged at the last day. The result is a covenantal vision where **assurance**, **holiness**, and **hope** cohere, rooted in **Christ’s accomplishment** and **the Spirit’s application**.

#### 8. Style, sources, and ecclesial posture
Jones’s distinctive style integrates **scholastic precision** and Puritan **practical divinity**, citing **Goodwin**, **Owen**, **Sibbes**, **Charnock**, and **Witsius** alongside **Turretin** and **Calvin**. He writes for the church, yet his footnotes repay scholarly attention, especially in **Why Heaven Kissed Earth** 2013 and **Antinomianism** 2013. He advances a **classical Reformed** posture on **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **the doctrine of God**, while attending to contemporary pastoral pressures around **identity**, **assurance**, and **discipleship**. His public voice during the 2010s sanctification debates positioned him as a critic of misapplications of **grace** that deflate the gospel’s summons to **holiness**.

Ecclesially, Jones identifies with confessional **Presbyterianism**, employing the **Westminster Standards** as theological grammar. He aims to display the Puritans not as museum pieces but as physicians of the soul whose cases inform ongoing pastoral triage. That posture yields a canon of retrieval: **A Puritan Theology** 2012 sets the map; **Knowing Christ** 2015 and **God Is** 2017 supply doctrinal devotion; **Antinomianism** 2013 and **Knowing Sin** 2022 address weak points in modern evangelicalism; and **The Prayers of Jesus** 2019 exemplifies how **Christology** governs piety.

#### 9. Theological development and contemporary significance
Across his corpus, Jones’s thought develops not by oscillation but by consolidation around **Christ-centered holiness** under **classical theism**. The early concentration on **Puritan Christology** widens into doctrinal synthesis where **divine attributes** regulate worship, **union with Christ** frames sanctification, and **covenant theology** organizes the relation of **law and gospel**. The hermeneutical conviction remains stable: the categories of **Reformed orthodoxy** are not antiquarian but providentially bequeathed tools for the church’s exegesis and ethics. This yields a recognizable pattern: define terms with **scholastic distinctions**, anchor claims in **confessional theology**, and conclude with **pastoral casuistry**.

The contemporary significance of Jones’s work lies in its countercultural insistence that **doctrinal density** is pastorally necessary. In an era tempted by theological minimalism and experientialism, his retrieval of **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** stabilizes worship; his articulation of **Christ’s obediences** stabilizes assurance; his framing of **judgment according to works** stabilizes the moral seriousness of grace; and his Puritan files on **sin**, **repentance**, and **assurance** stabilize the conscience. The integrative contribution is a Reformed habitus where **orthodoxy** and **orthopraxy** are mutually implicative because they are concentrically ordered around **the mediator**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
Within the **Westminster Theological Seminary** stream, Jones’s project aligns strongly with the **confessional** and **historical-theological** commitments of **Vos**, **Murray**, and **Gaffin** on **union with Christ**, the inseparability of **justification** and **sanctification**, and the eschatological shape of Christian life. His retrieval of **classical theism** coheres with the seminary’s defense of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, while his Puritan casuistry resonates with a pastoral application of redemptive-historical preaching. The principal tension concerns the rhetoric of **conditions in the covenant of grace** and **judgment according to works**. Jones carefully situates these within **sola fide** and the **duplex gratia**, yet some in the WTS orbit, especially those wary of anything sounding like **neonomianism** in the wake of the **Shepherd** controversy, will ask for sharper fencing: stress the absolute unconditionality of justification by the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, emphasize the public and declarative character of the last judgment in relation to **union with Christ**, and ensure that obedience is described as necessary consequent, not antecedent, to covenant enjoyment. An alternative accent within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would lean on a strong **works republication** in the Mosaic economy, keeping the works principle adumbrated in typological law-covenant structures while guarding the **new covenant** as unilaterally gracious in its justifying core. Even here, Jones’s own use of **Witsius** and **Turretin** provides the internal resources to sharpen formulations without altering substance. In sum, his contribution is substantively aligned with **Westminster** theology, and where rhetorical edges invite pushback, the correction is a matter of accent and ordering, not of first principles concerning **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, or **history**.
