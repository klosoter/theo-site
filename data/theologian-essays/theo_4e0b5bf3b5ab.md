### ESSAY
Anthony C. Thiselton emerges as a major Anglican voice clarifying how **hermeneutics** mediates between **Scripture**, **doctrine**, and **church** across the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Formed in the intellectual cross-currents of **analytic philosophy** and **continental phenomenology**, he labored within British universities and the Church of England to articulate a disciplined account of understanding that honors **authorial intention** while acknowledging the historically conditioned **horizons** of readers. In **The Two Horizons** 1980, Thiselton established an agenda for theological interpretation that appropriates **Hans-Georg Gadamer** on **fusion of horizons** and **belonging**, yet anchors interpretation in the determinate force of texts as communicative acts. The Anglican texture of his work is unmistakable. He traded in the grammar of **scripture, sacrament, and church**, with an evangelical concern for **clarity of the gospel**, and a pastoral awareness of the **Holy Spirit** as the living agent of understanding.

Thiselton's methodological center is a chastened **critical realism** that navigates between the Scylla of **naive objectivism** and the Charybdis of **postmodern relativism**. Drawing on **Gadamer** and **Ricoeur**, he insists that understanding involves **distanciation** as well as **belonging**. The text confronts us as other, resisting our projections, yet invites us into a transformed horizon where understanding is possible. With **E. D. Hirsch** he concedes the continuing relevance of **authorial intention**, but he recasts intention as an accessible horizon rather than a private mental state. For Thiselton, the canonically stabilized text provides **constraints** on interpretation, while the ecclesial tradition furnishes **habits of reading** that facilitate rather than foreclose hearing. The interpreter's task is neither to absolutize the **historical-critical** apparatus nor to bypass it, but to orchestrate grammatical, historical, and theological judgments within a **fusion of horizons** that finally submits to the text's address as **Word of God**.

A key advance in Thiselton's trajectory is the deployment of **speech-act theory** to articulate Scripture's authority as communicative action. Learning from **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, he distinguishes **locution**, **illocution**, and **perlocution**, arguing that biblical texts do not merely describe realities but perform acts. Baptismal and eucharistic words, promises, and verdicts are not only propositional but **illocutionary**. Building on **Ian Ramsey** on model and qualifier and attentive to **Wittgenstein's** account of **language games**, Thiselton presents doctrinal statements as deeply **self-involving**. Confessing the **Trinity** is not the recital of metaphysical data alone but a participation in a practice-regulated speech act that binds the church to the Father through the Son in the Spirit. He resists any opposition between truth and performance. The **illocutionary force** of doctrine secures its truth as performed commitment, while preserving its **cognitive content** against the flattening tendencies of the purely emotive or pragmatic.

The fruit of these commitments appears in a sequence of major works that progressively expand the scope of theological hermeneutics. **The Two Horizons** 1980 established the program by yoking biblical exegesis to **Gadamerian** philosophical hermeneutics. **New Horizons in Hermeneutics** 1992 pushed beyond the original brief into the wider field, absorbing developments in **semiotics**, **reader-response**, and **pragmatics**, while maintaining realist constraints. **Interpreting God and the Postmodern Self** 1995 confronted **Derrida** and **Foucault**, critiquing the reduction of meaning to power and play, and defending a thick account of **reference**, **promise**, and **personhood**. **Thiselton on Hermeneutics** 2006 collected and extended these essays, supplying the conceptual tools that culminated in **The Hermeneutics of Doctrine** 2007. In that latter volume, Thiselton fused hermeneutics and dogmatics, reframing doctrinal loci through **speech-act** categories while insisting on doctrinal **truth** and **normativity**. Later syntheses such as **Hermeneutics: An Introduction** 2009 and **Systematic Theology** 2015 distilled the argument for students and pastors, while **The Holy Spirit** 2013 traced pneumatological themes from Scripture through tradition to contemporary renewal, emphasizing the **Spirit** as the personal agent of communicative **presence**.

His exegetical craft is perhaps nowhere clearer than in **The First Epistle to the Corinthians** 2000 in the NIGTC series, where **philology**, **socio-rhetorical awareness**, and **speech-act** sensibilities converge. On **chapters 12 to 14**, Thiselton reads **charismata** through the lens of **illocutionary** order and **edification**, resisting both reductionist cessationism and uncritical enthusiasm, and highlighting the Pauline concern for **intelligibility** and **love**. His extended analysis of **glossolalia** and **prophecy** models his method: close attention to **Greek semantics**, reception of **Greco-Roman rhetoric**, and a theological judgment about the **ecclesial perlocutions** of worship. On **1 Corinthians 15** he combines **historical** judgments about resurrection with **pragmatic** concerns for how the gospel's verdict creates a new horizon of **hope** and **steadfastness**. Throughout, the commentary enacts a **two horizons** vision, refusing the false choice between the ancient world and contemporary application by showing how the text, as communicative action, addresses the church across time.

Thiselton's doctrinal proposals in **The Hermeneutics of Doctrine** 2007 aim to secure the performative efficacy and cognitive stability of classical teaching. On the **Trinity**, he defends the **rule of faith** as a communal illocution that both names the divine life and regulates doxological practice. On **atonement**, he retrieves a **polyphonic** set of biblical illocutions, warning against reduction to a single model, and commending attention to **verdict**, **reconciliation**, and **victory** as distinct acts of God performed in Christ. On **justification**, he stresses the **forensic illocution** within Paul's proclamation, while resisting any disjunction between declarative judgment and **transformative perlocution** in sanctification. On **sacrament**, he contends for **performative realism** without magical inflation, proposing that Word and sign as **illocutions** actually constitute and locate the church within the **economy of grace**. In each case, the doctrinal speech act is tethered to Scripture's **linguistic forms**, ecclesial usage, and the realities to which they refer, thereby connecting **truth**, **meaning**, and **practice**.

His sustained engagement with postmodernity articulates a path beyond both **foundationalism** and **skepticism**. In **Interpreting God and the Postmodern Self** 1995, Thiselton confronts the dissolution of the **self** in theorists such as **Derrida** and **Foucault**, yet accepts a chastened account of the subject's situatedness. Drawing on **Ricoeur's** hermeneutics of **suspicion** and **second naivete**, he endorses critical distance from idolatrous readings while pressing toward a recovered **trust** in the text's capacity to address and reform the interpreter's horizon. His frequent appeals to **hermeneutical virtues** such as humility, patience, and charity exemplify the Anglican habit of theological retrieval disciplined by **scriptural authority**. He resists **Stanley Fish's** stronger reader-response by insisting on the text's **illocutionary force** that constrains reception, and he criticizes **George Lindbeck's** cultural-linguistic model when it threatens to detach doctrine from **reference** and **reality**.

Even when speaking most philosophically, Thiselton the churchman keeps his eye on pastoral theology, especially in his work on the **Holy Spirit** and the **last things**. In **The Holy Spirit** 2013 he maps biblical and historical pneumatology, engaging **patristic theology**, **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** developments, and Reformation sources to argue that the Spirit is the enabling condition of **understanding** and the personal agent of **presence** in Scripture and sacrament. He commends a balanced ecclesial discernment of **charisms**, governed by **love** and **edification**, and shaped by a communicative model of divine action. In explorations of **eschatology**, including **Life after Death** and allied writings, he refuses speculative chronology in favor of **resurrection realism**, emphasizing how Christian hope reorients the **self** and the **community** as a lived horizon. Across these foci, the leitmotif persists: God's **word** does what it says, and the church receives that doing in faithful understanding and obedient practice.

Thiselton's scholarly posture is dialogical, yet disciplined. He retrieves **Gadamer** on tradition without capitulating to traditionalism, and he leverages **Hirsch** on intention without committing to positivism. He learns from **Wittgenstein** that meaning is use, but he insists with **Ricoeur** that metaphor and narrative open genuine **reference** beyond mere intra-linguistic play. He reads **Barth** appreciatively on the primacy of divine **revelation** as event and Word, yet he resists any eclipse of human linguistic agency in Scripture. He acknowledges **Pannenberg** on **truth** as eschatological disclosure, while he guards the present authority of canonical illocutions. Dialogue partners like **N. T. Wright** exhibit family resemblances in **critical realism** and the narrative shape of **Scripture**, though Thiselton's own register remains more explicitly linguistic and philosophical.

The pedagogical reach of Thiselton has been extensive. Through **Hermeneutics: An Introduction** 2009 and **Systematic Theology** 2015 he has catechized generations into the grammar of **hermeneutical philosophy**, the canons of **biblical exegesis**, and the **doctrinal loci** of classical faith. His edited **Thiselton Companion to Christian Theology** 2015 indexed the field for pastors and students, securing footholds across **Trinity**, **Christology**, **ecclesiology**, and **ethics**, always with an eye to how language performs its task. The lasting contribution of his work is not a novel doctrine but a textured account of how the **church** may responsibly hear **Scripture** today. He dignifies the interpreter's historical location while refusing to cede the text's **authority**. He brings the analytic rigors of **Austin** and the philosophical breadth of **Gadamer** to the service of evangelical Anglican preaching and catechesis.

From a Reformed and Westminster vantage, the gains and tensions in Thiselton's project can be rendered concisely. Positively, his **critical realism**, **textual constraints**, and **speech-act** account of **divine communicative action** fortify a robust doctrine of **Scripture** as God's covenantal Word, resonate with **sola Scriptura**, and cohere with a **redemptive-historical** reading that attends to **authorial intent** both human and divine. His insistence that doctrines carry **cognitive content** while functioning **illocutionarily** complements a classical commitment to **propositional revelation** and the **analogia fidei**. Yet caution is warranted where **Gadamerian fusion** and thick appeals to **tradition** might be construed to relativize **perspicuity** or dilute the determinacy of **authorial meaning**. A Westminster alternative would weight the self-attesting **claritas** of Scripture, the principial role of **covenant** in epistemology, and the priority of the **Spirit's** internal testimony, ensuring that **perlocutionary effects** never overshadow the primacy of **truth-claim**. Likewise, in areas of **charismata**, his measured openness sits in tension with strands of Reformed **cessationism**. The best synthesis receives Thiselton's **speech-act realism** and hermeneutical virtues while securing, under the **Lordship of Christ**, the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture's **propositional and performative** address.
