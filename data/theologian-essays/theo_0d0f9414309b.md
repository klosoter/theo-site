### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Michael Barram emerged as a voice in contemporary **missional hermeneutics** at the cusp of the twenty-first century, when the Western churches confronted secularization and postcolonial critique alongside a global South Christianity increasingly attuned to **economic justice** and **public witness**. Teaching in the Bay Area at Saint Mary’s College of California since the early 2000s, Barram brings biblical scholarship into conversation with **practical theology**, reading Scripture with a view to the church’s participation in the **missio Dei**. His formation unfolds within an ecumenical but decidedly **progressive theology**, attentive to issues that **Catholic social teaching** names as the **common good** and the **preferential option for the poor**, even as his exegesis remains anchored in **Pauline ethics** and the concrete problems of first-century assemblies.

Barram’s method is a deliberate integration of **socio-rhetorical exegesis**, **narrative ethics**, and ecclesially located **moral discernment**. Under the aegis of **Darrell Guder’s** proposal that mission is not an activity but the very identity of the church, Barram construes the **missio Dei** as the canonical telos by which scriptural texts are read and appropriated. Inspired by **Richard B. Hays’s** figural and narrative reading in The Moral Vision of the New Testament, he employs a triangulation of **community, cross, and new creation**, but recasts these for explicitly **missional formation**. The result is a hermeneutical spiral in which exegesis of **Paul’s letters** generates normative guidance for communal practice, and ensuing praxis feeds back into renewed interpretive judgments. This reciprocal process yields an epistemic posture in which the Bible is not primarily a compendium of rules but a **mission-forming script**, shaping **virtues**, **practices**, and **economic habits** that witness to the **kingdom of God**.

#### 2. Early work: Paul as missional moral theologian
Barram’s early monograph, **Mission and Moral Reflection in Paul** (2006), set forth the provisional thesis that Paul’s ethical reasoning is irreducibly **missional**. Centering on texts such as **1 Corinthians 8–10**, **Romans 14–15**, and **Philippians 2**, he argues that Paul’s deliberation about food sacrificed to idols, factionalism, and contested freedoms is framed by concern for the church’s **public witness** among outsiders and its internal **edification** for God’s **eschatological purposes**. The guiding criteria in Paul’s discernment are not abstract deontologies but the advance of the **gospel**, the building up of **koinonia**, and the dramatization of the **cross-shaped** pattern of **kenosis**. In Barram’s reading, Paul constructs flexible, contextually sensitive judgments by subordinating rights language to the goal of **mission**. Thus the injunction to avoid scandal is reframed as a missional tactic for the sake of the **weak** and the integrity of communal **diakonia**, rather than a capitulation to moralism.

A notable feature of this project is Barram’s attention to the social dynamics of **patronage and benefaction** in the Greco-Roman world. Following lines later developed by **John M. G. Barclay** on **grace** as incongruent gift, Barram shows how Paul’s language of **charis** reconfigures the honor economy and destabilizes reciprocity expectations. The apostle’s coordination of **koinonia**, **charis**, and **diakonia** frames the collection for Jerusalem as a concrete expression of a **missional ethic** that makes visible the new economy of God’s **kingdom**. Here Barram’s practical-theological interest emerges: Pauline moral reflection is not an appendix to doctrine but the church’s means of aligning its quotidian life with the **missio Dei**. The upshot is a portrayal of Paul as a pastoral strategist whose doctrinal claims about **new creation** yield targeted guidance for contested behaviors in the marketplace, at meals, and in guild contexts.

#### 3. Missional Economics and the grammar of justice
Barram’s signature contribution, **Missional Economics: Biblical Justice and Christian Formation** (2018), presses this thesis into a comprehensive proposal. Beginning with **Torah** and the **Prophets**, he identifies a biblical **justice** grammar marked by **Sabbath**, **Jubilee**, **gleaning**, and the **God of the poor**, and then tracks its intensification in the **Jesus tradition** and **Acts**. He gives careful attention to **Acts 2–4** not as accidental enthusiasm but as a paradigmatic performance of **koinonia** ordered to public **diakonia**, and he treats **2 Corinthians 8–9**, **Galatians 2**, and **Romans 15** as Pauline templates for translocal **solidarity** in economic matters. The book’s thesis is that Christian communities are to be formed in **economic discipleship** by practices that embody the **kingdom of God** in contested public spaces. These practices include **simplicity**, **generosity**, **hospitality**, **Sabbath-keeping**, and resistance to **consumer capitalism** and **neoliberal** narratives of scarcity.

Methodologically, **Missional Economics** marries close exegesis with a formation-oriented ethic influenced by **Stanley Hauerwas** and resonant with **Christopher J. H. Wright’s** canonical presentation of the **mission of God**. Barram reads the biblical story as a mission-shaped narrative in which God’s reign reconfigures social and economic relations. He explicitly rejects a privatized soteriology for an integrative vision where **justification** and **sanctification** are inseparable from the church’s public practices of **justice** and **mercy**. Theologically, the leitmotif is participation: the people of God are called to participate in God’s **new creation** by their habits of shared life, money, and time, which thereby become sacraments of **charis** for the world. From catechesis to congregational budgeting, the book outlines a practical program for forming **virtues** that subvert patronage, hoarding, and the coercions of the market.

Beyond program, Barram labors to nuance the witness of **Paul** on **wealth** and **work**. He reads the exhortations to labor and share in **Ephesians 4:28** and the collection theology of **2 Corinthians 8–9** through the lens of **isotes** or equitable sufficiency, refusing both socialist leveling and laissez-faire inequity. The paradigm of **kenosis** is central: **Philippians 2** is not only a hymn of Christology but an ethic of descending generosity that becomes the grammar for economic life. In conversation with **John Barclay’s** analysis of **grace**, Barram highlights the incongruity of divine gift as warrant for indiscriminate generosity within the community and beyond. He resists readings of **Acts** and **Paul** that domesticate their public claims, favoring instead a church that practices **economic hospitality** as a sign of God’s **eschaton**.

#### 4. Missional hermeneutics and ecclesial praxis
Barram’s hermeneutical program has been articulated in essays and chapters within the **Reading the Bible Missionally** project under **Michael W. Goheen**. There he defines **missional hermeneutics** as the interpretive discipline that reads Scripture in, for, and from the church’s participation in the **missio Dei**. The canon furnishes a comprehensive story whose pressure is toward **witness** and **formation**, not mere information. This approach builds on **N. T. Wright’s** insistence that the New Testament completes Israel’s narrative in Jesus’s enthronement and the Spirit’s mission, yet Barram pushes further by specifying how congregations discern practical implications for budgets, vocational guidance, and neighborhood presence. A critical component is the **practical-theological spiral**: the church’s concrete failures and insights become occasions for rereading texts like **1 Corinthians** and **James** with new clarity about money, power, and hospitality.

In these essays Barram also engages constructively with **empire-critical** scholarship without collapsing into ideological monism. He acknowledges the insights of **Richard A. Horsley** and **Warren Carter** on Rome’s hegemony and the counter-imperial notes of **Paul** and the **Gospels**, yet he refuses to reduce **missio Dei** to anti-imperial resistance. For Barram, the **kingdom of God** is thickly ecclesial and doxological, so that the congregation’s Eucharistic life and **diakonia** are the primary sites of counter-formation. At the same time he is not content with ecclesial privacy; he urges public practices of **advocacy**, **solidarity**, and **service-learning** that align with the **common good**. This dialectic of internal formation and external presence is a hallmark of his contribution to **practical missiology**.

#### 5. Paul’s economic grammar: charis, koinonia, diakonia
A signature textual nexus for Barram is the triad of **charis**, **koinonia**, and **diakonia** in **2 Corinthians 8–9** and **Romans 15:25–29**. He reads **charis** not merely as unmerited favor but as an active economy of gift that creates a community of **koinonia** which then assumes **diakonia** toward the weak. The collection for Jerusalem thus becomes a prototype of **missional economics**, in which translocal networks of churches enact the **one new humanity** through reciprocal generosity. Against the grain of Greco-Roman **benefaction**, where gifts accrue honor to patrons and bind clients, Paul’s gospel of **incongruent grace** orders gifts to the praise of God and the mutual upbuilding of the body. This replaces coercion with freedom, competition with **isotes**, and scarcity with participation in God’s abundance.

Barram’s readings attend to historical nuances of **patronage**, echoing and anticipating work by **John Barclay** while emphasizing ecclesial formation. He underscores Paul’s framing of **generosity** as proof of the **gospel** and as extension of the **kenosis** pattern. The logic is cruciform: the body of Christ displays the mind of Christ by liquidating status and resources for the sake of the least. Here Barram’s progressive commitments surface as he argues that economic life belongs to the heart of **holiness**, not an optional diaconal appendix. He tends to integrate **justification**, **reconciliation**, and **sanctification** into a single participatory horizon of **new creation**, thereby resisting dualisms between spiritual salvation and material justice. The church’s economic life, he insists, is evangelistic because it embodies credible good news.

#### 6. Pedagogy, praxis, and public theology
In keeping with his formation agenda, Barram’s scholarship is pedagogically inflected, often advocating **service-learning** as a locus of **missional formation**. He joins biblical study to the cultivation of **virtues** and practices that can be assessed in congregational life. Theologically he appropriates elements of **Catholic social teaching** such as **solidarity** and the **common good**, yet he grounds them scripturally in a narrative of **exodus**, **exile**, and **new creation**. This enables trans-traditional partnerships where evangelical missional movements, mainline social justice ministries, and Catholic institutions can find a shared grammar in **missio Dei**. His public theology is modest yet insistent: churches should talk about wages, debt, and housing while also catechizing about **Sabbath**, **generosity**, and **hospitality**.

At the level of ecclesial leadership, Barram reframes pastoral tasks around **missional leadership** and **moral discernment**. He recommends processes that attend to Scripture, community stories, and the Spirit’s guidance in *communitas*, yielding practical experiments in alternative economic ordering. Congregational budgets become theological documents, strategic plans become **diaconal** commitments, and preaching becomes catechesis in **kingdom economics**. The aim is not culture war but long obedience in embodied witness, in which the church’s life becomes a public parable of God’s **reign**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and distinctives
Barram stands in respectful conversation with **Christopher J. H. Wright** on the canonical sweep of the **mission of God**, while giving finer-grained attention to **Pauline ethics** and local ecclesial practice. He shares with **N. T. Wright** the conviction that the New Testament narrates Israel’s God becoming king in Jesus and the Spirit, yet diverges by focusing less on grand narrative and more on **formation** and **virtue**. With **Stanley Hauerwas** he affirms the church as a polis, though Barram’s missional framing presses toward public engagement and **solidarity** beyond ecclesial boundaries. He overlaps with **empire-critical** interpreters in diagnosing the malformations of **imperial ideology**, but he declines to let anti-empire become the controlling hermeneutic, preferring **missio Dei** and **kingdom of God** as the dominant lenses.

His use of **narrative ethics** and **socio-rhetorical** tools aligns him with **Richard Hays** and **Ben Witherington**, yet his constructive burden is more ecclesial and practical. He appreciates the insights of **John Barclay** on **grace’s** incongruity and superabundance, appropriating them as warrants for indiscriminate generosity. Distinctively, Barram insists that any account of **discipleship** that leaves economic life untouched has not yet grasped **Paul’s gospel**. The church’s sacramental and diaconal lives are not separable: **Eucharist** trains **generosity**, and **generosity** makes **Eucharist** credible.

#### 8. Theological profile and contribution
Theologically, Barram’s profile is that of a biblically grounded, ecclesially located, and socially alert interpreter who treats **missio Dei** as the comprehensive horizon for doctrine and ethics. He does not write dogmatics; his dogmatic instincts are nonetheless clear. God is the sender whose **kingdom** advances through a Spirit-formed people; Christ’s **kenosis** is the shape of redeemed life; the Spirit’s gifts equip the body for **diakonia**; and eschatology is not escapist but an **already/not yet** summons to embodied **justice**. Ethical method is participatory and communal, with **virtue ethics** as handmaiden to **missional formation**. His constructive payoffs are concrete: categories such as **koinonia**, **charis**, **isotes**, and **hospitality** furnish a Pauline grammar for congregations to examine consumer desires, deploy budgets, and render public witness.

Barram’s enduring contribution is to have synthesized **missional hermeneutics** with **economic discipleship** in a way that is textually attentive and pastorally actionable. By reading **Paul** as a practical theologian of mission, he elevates moral reflection from peripheral counsel to the core choreography of the church’s participation in the **missio Dei**. He has thereby offered a constructive bridge between biblical studies and pastoral leadership that helps communities test their faith by their economic lives, their shared tables, and their care for the vulnerable. In an era of neoliberal hegemony and ecclesial fragmentation, this is a timely and theologically weighty gift.

In Reformed and WTS perspective, Barram’s strengths and vulnerabilities surface together. His **missional hermeneutics** rightly insists that Scripture forms a people for God’s **kingdom**, and his recovery of **koinonia** and **diakonia** resonates with **diaconal** ministries and the Reformed emphasis on **vocation** under **Christ’s lordship**. Yet concerns arise where teleology risks steering exegesis: the **missio Dei** lens can flatten textual diversity and subordinate the Bible’s own redemptive-historical emphases to contemporary **praxis**. Classical Reformed theology centers the **gospel** in **justification by faith**, **union with Christ**, and the **ordinary means of grace**, from which good works flow as grateful obedience. Barram’s integration of salvation and social ethics sometimes blurs **law and gospel**, and his ecclesial-economic program threatens to conflate **church** and **kingdom** in ways that a **two-kingdoms** prudence would resist. Where he reads **Acts 2–4** and **2 Corinthians 8–9** as near-prescriptive economic templates, a **covenant theology** approach would distinguish redemptive-historical intrusions, uphold **liberty of conscience**, and assign public justice to the civil sphere under **common grace**, while still calling the church to robust **mercy**. The best Reformed alternative affirms Barram’s summons to generosity and **solidarity**, but grounds ethics in the indicatives of **justification** and **adoption**, orders mission to Word and Sacrament, and situates public action within **vocation** and prudential wisdom, thereby safeguarding the primacy of Christ’s finished work even as the church lives out costly **diakonia**.
