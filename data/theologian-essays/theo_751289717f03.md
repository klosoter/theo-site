### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Born in 1560 in Oudewater and orphaned by Spanish violence, **Jacobus Arminius** matured within the **Dutch Reformation**, where theology served ecclesial consolidation and civic peace. Sponsored to study at Leiden in the 1570s, he absorbed a humanist **philologia sacra** that prized textual precision and the **consensus of the ancient church**. Further study in Geneva under **Theodore Beza** and in Basel exposed him to rigorous **Reformed scholasticism** and to the sharper edges of **supralapsarian predestination** then debated across Europe. As pastor in Amsterdam from 1588 to 1603, he forged a pastoral method marked by **exegesis**, catechetical clarity, and sensitivity to conscience, especially in Romans and John. Appointed to Leiden in 1603 against the protest of **Franciscus Gomarus**, he carried a professorial resolve to adjudicate contested loci through **public disputations**, where Scripture and catholic doctrine held primacy and syllogisms served rather than ruled. His method combines **sola Scriptura**, an Augustinian diagnosis of **original sin**, and careful use of **scholastic distinctions**, always constrained by the pastoral aim to secure **assurance in Christ** without implicating God in sin.

Arminius positioned himself as a Reformed catholic, embracing **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** against **Socinian** innovations, while resisting any form of decree that in his judgment violated **divine goodness** or erased the moral seriousness of **gospel calls**. He affirmed the Reformed marks of the church and maintained the **real spiritual presence** in the Supper in the line of **Calvin**, situating his soteriological revisions inside a broader orthodoxy. The classroom and consistory were his crucibles, where controversy with **Gomarus** over Romans 9 revealed that what was at stake was not merely logical orderings inside the **decretum Dei**, but the hermeneutics of election and the nature of **grace** as gift that summons rather than coerces.

#### 2. Works and programmatic statements
The architecture of his thought is visible in the **Public Disputations 1603-1609**, a pedagogical series at Leiden that maps loci from **God and the divine attributes** to **free will and the grace of God**. These disputations carry his hallmark of definition, thesis, objection, and reply, revealing a commitment to **scholastic clarity** that rivals his opponents. The **Declaration of Sentiments 1608**, delivered before the States of Holland, is the most programmatic and pastoral of his writings, where he narrates his journey through the doctrine of **predestination** and proposes an alternative rooted in **Christocentric decree** and **foreknowledge** rather than a naked **voluntas absoluta**. The **Letter to Hippolytus a Collibus 1608** provides a compact statement of his views on **grace**, **free will**, **justification**, and **perseverance**, framed as counsel to a royal chaplain amid English debates.

Other classroom essays, such as analyses of **Romans 7 and 9**, expose a hermeneutical strategy that distinguishes Paul’s autobiographical use of the law from regenerate experience and reads **Jacob I loved, Esau I hated** as corporate-historical election oriented to service in the **covenant**, not deterministic individual reprobation unto damnation. Although his writings were published piecemeal during his lifetime, the **Works of Arminius** compiled in 1629 by Remonstrant editors preserve his **disputationes**, sermons, and letters, ensuring that it is his own formulations of **conditional election**, **prevenient grace**, and **universal atonement** that confront subsequent Reformed confessions.

#### 3. Predestination reframed
Arminius’s most decisive move is a restructuring of **predestination**. Rejecting **supralapsarianism** as making God the producer of sin and **infralapsarian unconditional election** as collapsing the gospel call into a hidden decree, he proposed a fourfold order of the **decree of God** centered on **Christ** and the church. First, God decreed to appoint **Jesus Christ** as mediator and head of a community of redeemed persons. Second, God decreed to save those who **repent and believe** and to condemn those who persist in unbelief and impenitence. Third, God decreed to provide **sufficient and necessary means of salvation**, including the proclamation of the **gospel**, the gift of the **Holy Spirit**, and sacramental administration. Fourth, God decreed to administer these means in history according to **wisdom and justice**. This is **conditional election**, where the condition is not meritorious works but **faith uniting to Christ**, itself enabled by **grace**.

He anchors this restructuring in **divine foreknowledge**, not as a passive observation but as a prior, certain, and wise cognition of contingent future free acts that God freely permits and orders. Here he engages **Molina** on *scientia media* and **Suarez** on concurrence. While refusing to enthrone a speculative **scientia media** as dogma, Arminius uses it as a conceptual tool to articulate how God can know future contingents without causally determining them. Thus the decree that believers shall be saved is eternal, certain, and Christic, yet the decree does not necessitate unbelief. The upshot is that election is genuinely **evangelical**, announced in the **covenant**, mediated through **means of grace**, and aligned to the **public offer**.

#### 4. Grace, will, and calling
Against both **Pelagianism** and a determinist construal of **monergism**, Arminius affirms **total depravity** as the inability of fallen humans to will or do any saving good without **grace**. He teaches **prevenient grace**, the prior assistance of the **Holy Spirit** through the word that frees and enables the will to cooperate with God. This grace is universal in provision through **Christ**, genuinely offered to all under the **gospel**, and necessary for every holy act. Yet it is **resistible grace**, since Scripture depicts humans as resisting the **Spirit**, grieving the **Spirit**, and refusing the **gospel call**. Arminius insists that to call grace resistible is not to deny its efficacy, since the effect arises from God’s wise will to work congruently with rational creatures rather than by coercion.

In **vocation** and **conversion**, Arminius carefully distinguishes the **external call** from the **internal persuasion** of the Spirit, and he denies that saving faith can be wrought by nature or habit. Faith is a gift that includes knowledge, assent, and trust, yet as gift it does not annihilate volition. He interprets **John 6** not as a secret irresistible drawing of some and not others, but as the Father’s pedagogical and persuasive drawing through **word and Spirit**, which can be refused. He reads **Acts 7.51** as a decisive indicator that divine agency does not preclude human culpability for resisting grace. This synergistic soteriology is ordered so that all glory accrues to **grace**, since initiative and sufficiency belong to God, while responsibility attaches to the human refusal of offered mercy.

#### 5. Sin, justification, and assurance
On **original sin**, Arminius affirms both **imputed guilt** from Adam and an inherent corruption that enthralls the will. He resists speculative accounts that would deny the just condemnation of sin, yet he safeguards divine equity by emphasizing the **covenantal solidarity** by which God deals with humanity. In **justification**, he upholds the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**, received by faith alone, and denies any infusion of habits as formal cause. He argues that faith’s instrumentality does not constitute a meritorious condition, but the appointed means of union with **Christ**. His pastoral concerns surface in his doctrine of **assurance**. Believers can enjoy a moral and spiritual certainty grounded in the **promises of God**, the **witness of the Spirit**, and the fruits of **sanctification**, yet Arminius withholds an absolute, infallible assurance for all believers at all times, lest presumption breach **holy fear**.

He addresses **perseverance** with studied reserve. In his **Declaration of Sentiments**, he acknowledges the strength of texts for the **perseverance of the saints**, yet he declines a definitive view on whether those truly regenerate may finally fall away. He accepts that many passages teach God’s powerful preservation of believers, while others warn against apostasy in a manner that seems personally directed. His students and later Remonstrants will press this to affirm the possibility of final apostasy, but Arminius’s own posture is exegetically cautious, urging further synodical examination.

#### 6. Atonement, church, and sacraments
Arminius defends a classic **satisfaction** or **penal substitution** model of the **atonement**, but he rejects **limited atonement**. Christ died for **all humans** sufficiently, and the gospel can be preached indiscriminately as true good news for each hearer. The **intention** of the atonement is universal provision, while its **application** is conditional through faith. This aligns with **universal prevenient grace** and secures the moral texture of the **offer of the gospel**. The efficacy lies not in an intrinsic limitation of the cross but in God’s appointed means of union with **Christ**. He retains a robust **union with Christ** as the fountain of all benefits, so that election pertains to those in **Christ** by faith.

Ecclesiologically, he remains within the **Reformed Church** of the Netherlands, embracing **infant baptism** as sign and seal of the **covenant**, and the **Lord’s Supper** as spiritual nourishment through the **Holy Spirit**. He supports presbyterial **discipline** and a learned ministry and urges moderation in controversy to protect the flock. His sacramental theology is Calvinian rather than Zwinglian, and his insistence on universal atonement does not flatten the distinction between church and world but intensifies missionary **proclamation**.

#### 7. Providence, concurrence, and theodicy
Arminius’s doctrine of **providence** is classically Reformed in affirming **omnipotent governance**, **divine concurrence**, and the certainty of God’s counsel, yet he sharply distinguishes between God’s **efficacious willing of good** and God’s **permissive decree** regarding evil. He insists that God concurs with secondary causes according to their natures and that sin has a **deficient cause** in the created will rather than an efficient cause in God. This safeguards **divine holiness** and human culpability. His nuanced use of **concurrence** aligns with **Aquinas** and the Reformed scholastics yet avoids formulations that seem to collapse concurrence into determination.

In the knowledge of God, he considers **scientia media**, the middle knowledge that would place counterfactuals of creaturely freedom under divine cognition. Arminius treats this as a viable explanation of **foreknowledge** that does not compromise sovereignty, though he refuses to carry the whole edifice of **Molinism** into Protestant dogmatics. The point for him is exegetical and pastoral, not speculative. God foreknows certainly what free agents will do under offered **grace**, and on that basis decrees to save believers and condemn unbelievers. The net effect is a theodicy where God is not the author of sin, the gospel call is sincere, and the history of **covenant** displays both divine patience and justice.

#### 8. Controversy, condemnation, and legacy
Conflict with **Gomarus** escalated from 1603 until Arminius’s death in 1609, with debates over **Romans 9**, **reprobation**, and the **extent of the atonement**. After his death, his colleagues and students drafted the **Remonstrance 1610**, the five articles that codified **conditional election**, **universal atonement**, **prevenient resistible grace**, the necessity of **regeneration**, and a cautious statement on **perseverance**. The **Synod of Dort 1618-1619** condemned these views, crafting the **Canons of Dort** that formalized the Reformed alternative later summarized as **TULIP**. Dort’s articulation of **unconditional election**, **limited atonement**, and **irresistible grace** was aimed in part at stabilizing the Dutch Reformed churches under civil strain.

Yet Arminius’s legacy did not end at Dort. **Simon Episcopius** developed a more rationalized Remonstrant system, **Hugo Grotius** constructed a **governmental theory of atonement**, and in the eighteenth century **John Wesley** appropriated **Arminius** as a bulwark of evangelical holiness, though Wesley’s **Wesleyan Arminianism** highlights **assurance** and **perfection** in ways not central to Arminius himself. In modern evangelicalism, appeals to **prevenient grace** and **universal atonement** often carry the Arminian banner, and theologians continue to test compatibilist and libertarian accounts of **freedom** in light of Arminius’s careful distinction between **decree** and **execution**.

#### 9. Dogmatic profile in sum
Placing Arminius within the **Reformed tradition** requires seeing both continuity and rupture. He is classically theistic, affirming **Trinity**, **incarnation**, **divine simplicity**, and the **authority of Scripture**. He is ecclesially Reformed in **sacraments**, **worship**, and confession of **justification by faith alone**. His departures focus on **predestination** and the **operation of grace**, where he aims to preserve divine goodness and the sincerity of the **gospel call**. His fourfold decree, **conditional election**, **universal atonement**, and **resistible grace** are coordinated by a robust doctrine of **prevenient grace** that restores moral liberty. Exegetically, he prioritizes corporate and historical readings of texts like **Romans 9**, while insisting that election remains certain and gracious in **Christ**. Philosophically, he adapts **concurrence** and limited aspects of **Molinism** to avoid determinism while refusing to sever God’s knowledge from the world’s contingency.

He writes as a pastor-theologian, worried that young believers cannot locate themselves in the good news if the **decretum absolutum** is preached without the **promissio evangelii**. He seeks a soteriology where the **free offer** is no fiction, where blame for unbelief lies in the sinner, and where believers can truly give thanks that grace both precedes and accompanies all.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Arminius’s project exhibits both noble intentions and decisive missteps. His defense of **divine simplicity**, his Calvinian **sacramental** piety, and his insistence on **total depravity** align with **Westminster Confession** commitments. Yet his reconfiguration of **election** by **foreknowledge of faith** dislocates grace from the **decree** and confuses the asymmetry between **regeneration** and **faith** upheld in **effectual calling**. By construing **prevenient grace** as universally enabling and **resistible**, he secures the sincerity of the **gospel offer** at the expense of the efficacy of **special grace** promised in **covenant** to the elect. His **universal atonement** diminishes the covenantal particularity of **Christ’s priestly intercession**, which the Reformed link to **definite atonement** and the golden chain of **Romans 8**. His appeal to **scientia media**, even as a tool, risks relocating certainty from the divine will of grace to a divine cognition of creaturely contingencies, thereby introducing a formal dependence of the decree upon foreseen acts that the **confessional Reformed** locate instead in God’s sovereign purpose of **mercy and justice**. A stronger alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy maintains the well-meant **free offer**, robust **common grace**, and real **covenant conditions** at the level of administration, while preserving unconditional **election**, **particular redemption**, and **irresistible grace** as the hidden but effectual depth of the **covenant of grace**, thus holding together the universality of proclamation and the particularity of salvation without making faith the condition that grounds the decree.
