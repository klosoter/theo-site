### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Anglican location, and Puritan retrieval
Born in 1926 in Gloucester and dying in 2020 in Vancouver, **J. I. Packer** emerged from postwar Britain as the most widely read voice of **Anglican evangelicalism**. At **Oxford** he encountered **Inter-Varsity** student piety, attended lectures by **C. S. Lewis**, and found in secondhand shops the spiritual theology of the **Puritans** that would define his project of retrieval. His **DPhil on Richard Baxter**, completed in 1954, set his frame: the intellectual and pastoral synthesis of **Reformed scholastic clarity** with **practical godliness**. Ordained in 1952 and teaching at **Tyndale Hall, Bristol**, he became a bridge between **academic theology** and **lay catechesis**, aligning with **Banner of Truth** to reintroduce **John Owen**, **Thomas Goodwin**, and **Richard Sibbes** as living guides. The backdrop was a Britain suspicious of so-called **fundamentalism**, a Church of England mixed by **liberalism**, **Anglo-Catholicism**, and historic **evangelicalism**. Packer stood here as a classical **Reformed catholic** voice who intended to renew the church through **Scripture**, **doctrine**, and **holiness**.

Packer’s early essays coalesced in **Fundamentalism and the Word of God, 1958**, a manifesto for **biblical authority** that rejected both **liberal historicism** and **fideistic anti-intellectualism**. He contended that **revelation** is verbal, propositional, and personal, that the **Holy Spirit** authenticates **Scripture** in and through rational instruments, and that doctrinal clarity serves doxology. This was not an abstract scholasticism but the Puritan program of **practical divinity**, where knowledge of the **triune God** guides life under the **covenant of grace**.

#### 2. Method: Scripture first, ministerial reason, and disciplined antinomy
Methodologically Packer is defined by **Sola Scriptura**, the **sufficiency and clarity of Scripture**, and the submission of **reason** as ministerial, never magisterial. He insisted on **analogia fidei**, the Scripture-interprets-Scripture canon, over any **analogia entis** that would construe natural being as a ladder to God. He affirmed **classical theism** and read the **divine attributes** within **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, refusing modern revisionisms that evacuated **aseity** and **impassibility**. At the same time he refused reductionist harmonization and introduced the term **antinomy** to name those biblical pairings that outstrip creaturely systematization. Divine **sovereignty** and human **responsibility**, the **particularity** of redemption and the **universal offer** of the gospel, and the **already** with the **not yet** in sanctification are held together as exegetically fixed yet cognitively asymmetrical. This disciplined antinomy, he argued, positions the theologian under **revelation** as **theologus viator**, wayfarer, rather than as metaphysical master.

Packer’s epistemic stance was cruciform and ecclesial. He insisted that **Word and Spirit** are inseparable, that the **Spiritus Sanctus** never bypasses the **verbum Dei**, and that the church must catechize through confessions, creeds, and a canon-informed piety. He retrieved **Puritan casuistry** not as legalism but as wise application of **law and gospel**. He was suspicious of **Barthian actualism** to the extent that it dilutes the settled **inscripturated** norm, and he repudiated **liberal experientialism** that dissolves doctrine into mere inwardness.

#### 3. Scripture and inerrancy: God Has Spoken and Chicago 1978
The heart of Packer’s bibliology appears in **God Has Spoken, 1965**, **Truth and Power, 1996**, and in his leadership within the **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy**, culminating in the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, 1978**. Packer defended **inerrancy** as a conceptual entailment of **verbal plenary inspiration**, anchoring it in the doctrine of **God’s truthfulness** and the **Christological** endorsement of the Old Testament and apostolic witness. He maintained **canonicity** as providentially recognized, championed **Scripture’s sufficiency** against both **tradition’s overreach** and **subjectivism**, and argued for **perspicuity** under the hermeneutical discipline of the **analogia fidei**. His collection **God’s Words, 1981** stayed close to the text yet pressed its doctrinal freight, modeling pastoral exegesis that nourishes worship.

His bibliological commitments were not merely theoretical. As **General Editor of the ESV, 2001**, Packer shaped a translation ethos that prized **verbal precision** joined to **literary clarity**, a concrete expression of his belief that faithful translation serves the church’s **catechesis**. Across these projects Packer linked **authority**, **clarity**, and **sufficiency** to the concrete work of preaching, counseling, and prayer, ensuring that doctrine returns to doxology.

#### 4. Knowing God: doctrine and doxology in the key of adoption
With **Knowing God, 1973**, Packer became an evangelical household name, yet the book is the distilled essence of **classical dogmatics**. He advances a covenantal account of **knowing God** as personal, relational, and yet conceptually rich, expounding **divine attributes** through biblical exegesis and pastoral application. He rebukes an age of **religious pragmatism** by insisting that **theology proper** determines the shape of the Christian life. The chapter on **adoption** is programmatic: whereas **justification** is the primary blessing because it meets our basic need for acquittal, **adoption** is the highest privilege because it grants **filial communion** with the Father through the Son by the Spirit. This **ordo salutis** insight shapes his entire vision of **sanctification** as the Spirit’s formation of **children of God**.

Packer’s pages on **God’s love**, **wrath**, and **wisdom** are framed by **divine simplicity** so that no attribute is isolated from the whole life of God *ad intra*. Yet every doctrine bends to worship and obedience *ad extra*. The Puritan cadence is unmistakable. **Knowledge of God** requires **meditation**, **self-examination**, and **obedience** under the **means of grace**, producing resilient humility rather than self-preoccupation. Here Packer’s synthesis of **doctrine and doxology** reinvigorated late-modern evangelical piety.

#### 5. Sovereignty and evangelism: compatibilism and definite atonement
Packer’s compatibilist soteriology comes to the fore in **Evangelism and the Sovereignty of God, 1961**. He argues that the Bible teaches both exhaustive **divine sovereignty** and real **human responsibility**, and that this is an **antinomy** to be believed and acted upon rather than a puzzle to be solved. Prayer presupposes sovereignty, preaching presupposes responsibility, and **evangelism** is the appointed means by which God gathers the elect. He rebukes **hyper-Calvinism** that would stifle evangelistic zeal and critiques **Pelagian** instincts that empty grace of its efficacy. The free, well-meant offer of the gospel rests firmly on **particular redemption** and **effectual calling**.

This balance was already evident in his famous **Introductory Essay to John Owen’s The Death of Death, 1959**, where he defends **definite atonement** as the Bible’s teaching on the intent and nature of the cross. The **penal substitution** of Christ saves actually, not potentially, and thus grounds assurance and mission. He resists **universalism**, **Amyraldian hypothetical universalism**, and any commodification of faith that treats it as self-generated. The Puritan matrix undergirds his insistence on **union with Christ**, **imputation**, and **repentance** as the fruit of **regeneration**, all rendered with pastoral clarity.

#### 6. Sanctification and the Spirit: against perfectionism and second blessing
In **Keep in Step with the Spirit, 1984**, **Rediscovering Holiness, 1992**, and related essays, Packer develops a classic **Reformed pneumatology** and ethics. He critiques **Keswick Higher Life** teaching and **charismatic second-blessing** claims insofar as they promise crisis experiences that bypass **ordinary means of grace**. He advances instead a double emphasis on **definitive sanctification** and **progressive sanctification**, drawing on **Romans 6** and **union with Christ**. The Spirit’s ministry is **Christocentric** and **Word-centered**, effecting **mortificatio** and **vivificatio** through **Scripture**, **sacraments**, **prayer**, and **church discipline**.

Packer integrates **assurance** with obedience, opposing both **antinomianism** and **legalism**. He retains the Puritan art of **casuistry** by discerning how the **Decalogue** functions as the shape of gratitude within the **covenant of grace**. He affirms a sober openness to the Spirit’s gifts while refusing to separate **charismata** from the rule of **canon**. His tone is irenic yet firm, a pastoral correction to pneumatic excesses without quenching zeal for **revival** and **mission**.

#### 7. Ecclesiology, controversy, and ecumenical forays
Ecclesially Packer stood as an **evangelical Anglican** committed to reform from within. The 1966 moment when **D. Martyn Lloyd-Jones** called evangelicals out of mixed denominations was decisive. Packer declined separatism and pursued **church renewal**, a strategy that provoked tensions with **Banner of Truth** circles. His coauthored **Growing into Union, 1970**, proposing a way forward for Anglican relationships, intensified the rift, since it read to many as too conciliatory toward **Anglo-Catholic** sacramentalism. These rifts prefigured later North American debates over **ecumenism** and **Evangelicals and Catholics Together, 1994**.

Relocating to **Regent College, Vancouver, 1979**, Packer became a transatlantic teacher of **catechesis** and **spirituality**, while remaining a public intellectual. He was a leader in the **ICBI**, a signatory of **Chicago 1978**, and later a signatory and defender of **ECT 1994** and **The Gift of Salvation, 1997**. His rationale emphasized **common mission**, a shared Trinitarian and Christological core, and the hope for convergence on **justification by faith**. Critics within the Reformed world charged compromise on **sola fide** and the **nature of the church**, while Packer replied that he had not relinquished Protestant distinctives and that cooperation on moral and evangelistic fronts was prudent. The episode exposed the tension between his **irenic catholicity** and his **confessional clarity**.

#### 8. Puritan vision and catechesis: a quest for godliness
Packer’s mature retrieval shines in **A Quest for Godliness, 1990**, a sweeping exposition of **Puritan theology** as a school of **godliness**. He portrays **Owen**, **Baxter**, and their peers as masters of **communion with God**, **preaching**, **family worship**, and **sabbath** practice. The project aimed to rehabilitate the Puritan legacy from caricature and to retool modern evangelicalism with habits of **meditation**, **self-examination**, and **church discipline**. In **Concise Theology, 1993** he offered a compact, catechetical **systematic theology**, reaffirming **Trinity**, **creation**, **providence**, **Christology**, **atonement**, **justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, **ecclesiology**, and **last things** in plain yet precise prose. Coupled with **Growing in Christ, 1977** and **Hot Tub Religion, 1987**, Packer steadily critiqued **therapeutic individualism** and **consumer religion**.

The cumulative effect was the rehabilitation of **catechesis** as the ordinary pathway to **spiritual maturity**. Packer wrote and taught as a pastor-theologian convinced that **doctrine makes disciples**. He wanted contemporary believers to inhabit the **Westminster catechetical** world where the **chief end of man** and the rhythm of **guilt, grace, gratitude** nourish a resilient pilgrimage.

#### 9. Doctrinal core and systematic balance
Across his corpus Packer occupies classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. He confesses **Trinitarian dogma** with **Chalcedonian** exactness, speaks of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** without capitulating to modern dilutions, and grounds all saving work in the **will and wisdom of God**. In **soteriology** he maintains **total depravity**, **unconditional election**, **definite atonement**, **effectual calling**, **justification extra nos** by the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness, **adoption** into filial communion, **sanctification** as progressive and Spirit-wrought, and **perseverance** under providence. He frames salvation within **unio cum Christo** so that the benefits are inseparable from the Benefactor.

Ethically he advances a Reformed **third use of the law**, rejecting both **antinomian liberty** and **perfectionist schemes**. He defends **penal substitution** as the center of atonement while acknowledging the breadth of biblical imagery. He reads **sacraments** as means of grace bound to the **Word**, insists on ordinary **Lord’s Day** discipline, and resists commodification of worship. His ecclesiology remains **Anglican** in form yet **Reformed** in substance, aligning with the **Thirty-Nine Articles** on Scripture, sin, grace, and justification. He defends **creation order** ethics and reads cultural engagement under the lordship of **Christus Rex** rather than the dictates of plausibility structures.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Packer’s strengths are luminous. On **Scripture** he anchors **inerrancy**, **sufficiency**, and **perspicuity** within **God’s truthfulness**, aligns with the **Westminster Confession**, and models **preaching** and **catechesis** that honor the **Word-Spirit** economy. In **soteriology** he is a faithful expositor of **penal substitution**, **definite atonement**, **justification by faith alone**, and **adoption**, combining doctrinal precision with spiritual direction in the **Puritan** style. In **pneumatology** he helpfully corrects **perfectionism** and **second-blessing** theologies by retrieving **ordinary means of grace** and **progressive sanctification**. Yet tensions appear. His appeal to **antinomy** risks functioning as a methodological stopgap where a more thorough **covenantal epistemology** and **creator-creature distinction** could render principled unity without flattening biblical tensions. His **ecclesial strategy** of intra-Anglican reform and his **ECT** commitments appear to some to blur **sola fide** and **visible-church** boundaries, especially given the abiding **Tridentine** anathemas and sacramental theologies at odds with **Westminster** doctrine. A **WTS** corrective would stress principled **separation without sectarianism**, firmer refusal of **Rome’s soteriology** as a different system of grace and merit, and a more explicit **Van Tillian** account of reason as covenantally conditioned rather than simply ministerial. Even so, the net alignment remains strong: Packer’s **Puritan retrieval**, **catechetical clarity**, and **devotional gravitas** render him a trusted teacher whose work can be received gratefully while his **ecumenical calculus** and **antinomy** method invite careful qualification.
