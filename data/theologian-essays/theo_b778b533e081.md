### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Born in 1958 and educated amid the late twentieth-century contest over **language, media, and modernity**, **John D. Peters** emerged as a leading theorist of communication as the century turned digital. His early career at the **University of Iowa** and later professorship at **Yale** placed him at the intersection of **American intellectual history**, **continental philosophy**, and **media studies**. The Cold War legacy of **information theory** and the postwar critique of **presence** in **Heidegger** and **Derrida** provided a field in which Peters crafted an original stance: communication is a problem of **address** before it is an achievement of **understanding**, and mediation is not a hindrance to truth but its ordinary condition. Methodologically he is a historical-genealogical reader of **Socrates, Augustine, Kierkegaard, and Benjamin**, a phenomenologist of **listening and transmission**, and an infrastructural realist of **media ecologies**. He rejects the **conduit metaphor** that treats ideas as packages moved intact between minds; instead he articulates a tragic anthropology where **miscommunication is structural**, not a mere accident to be engineered away. This method is hospitable to theological motifs such as **fallenness**, **caritas**, and **angelic mediation**, and it courts conversation with **Habermasian publicity** and **Luhmannian systems** without capitulating to either a consensus utopia or a sealed autopoiesis.

#### 2. Speaking into the Air: communication, communion, and failure
The thesis of **Speaking into the Air** (1999) is a brilliantly paced historical exegesis of the idea of communication from **Plato** to **telegraphy** to **broadcast**. The book’s emblem is **communication vs communion**: the longing for perfect understanding as **communio** is modernity’s secularized soteriology, while the actual practice of sending messages to strangers is a risky craft of **address and reception**. In contrast to dialogic pieties, Peters commends **dissemination**, the one-to-many scatter of the sower, and explores **broadcast** as the characteristic modern form. His portraits of **Socrates** challenging writing, **Augustine** wrestling with language and love, **Kierkegaard** obsessing over the single individual, and **Benjamin** meditating on mimesis and aura are threaded by a consistent claim: communication is an ethics of addressing others under conditions of opacity. He argues that **language** is not primarily a tool of information transfer but a hospitality to the other, marked by exposure to **noise** and the impossibility of total presence. Against the dream of **transparent immediacy**, he affirms a hermeneutic of humility, patience, and **charity**. The book’s historical chapters and conceptual interludes work as a counter-gospel to the cult of **interactive dialogue**, suggesting that even dialogue relies on infrastructures of **media** and asymmetries of **voice** and **audience**.

#### 3. Angels, ethics, and the metaphors of mediation
A signature contribution of **Speaking into the Air** is its **angelology of mediation**. Angels are exemplary messengers, and the angelic figure allows Peters to map the metaphysics of **presence and transmission** without invoking technological determinism. Angels signify the paradox of an address that bears more than itself and yet must take a form. In his treatment, the angel becomes a heuristic for the vexed status of **voice**, **authority**, and **distance**. Theologically resonant yet secular in method, this angelology yields an **ethics of address**: to communicate is to risk sending what one cannot control into a world one does not master. The drift is Augustinian: **caritas** is the better form of communication than **eros**, because caritas releases rather than seizes, acknowledging the alterity of the recipient. The angelic metaphor also critiques the technological sublime of **telepresence** by insisting that all mediation, even the most immediate voice, is shaped by **air** and **auditory infrastructures**. Thus, far from denigrating mediation, Peters sacralizes the ordinary elements through which messages travel, drawing on **Benjamin** and **Kierkegaard** to warn against idolatrous fusions of **communion** and **communication**.

#### 4. The Marvelous Clouds: elemental media and infrastructural realism
With **The Marvelous Clouds** (2015), Peters extends his thought from messages to environments, articulating a philosophy of **elemental media**. Rather than gadgets or channels alone, media are the **conditions of human dwelling**: **air, water, fire, earth**, and the cultural apparatuses that traffic in them. This is media theory as **cosmology**, influenced by **Heidegger’s** worldhood, **Latour’s** actor-networks, **Kittler’s** hard media, and **McLuhan’s** environmental aphorisms. Peters advocates **infrastructural realism**: roads, weather, calendars, ships, and clouds shape human being as decisively as discourse. He re-reads **Aristotle’s** elements and **Thales’s** materialisms through contemporary ecology to argue that media are not just intermediaries but the very milieux that make signaling possible. The theological gain, implicit but acute, is a doctrine of **creaturely finitude**: the human is a being addressed by the world’s elements, dependent on **breath** and **weather**. The book reinscribes communication into **natureculture**, resisting the abstraction of disembodied information. In place of the transcendence of pure meaning, he offers the immanence of **worldly mediation**, a stance that both echoes and reworks **Heidegger’s** account of **aletheia** as disclosure through earth and world.

#### 5. Free speech and the abyss of publicity
In **Courting the Abyss: Free Speech and the Liberal Tradition** (2005), Peters turns to the moral psychology of **publicity**. He contends that the liberal defense of speech often flirts with its own **demonic** underside, treating exposure to offensive or harmful speech as a necessary initiation into freedom. The abyss is the dark version of **communicative rationality**: an initiation rite that baptizes with shock. By tracing the genealogy of **free speech** across **Milton**, **Mill**, and modern jurisprudence, he shows how the liberal imaginary treats the **public sphere** as a moral gymnasium where citizens harden themselves. Here again the contrast between **dialogue and dissemination** is decisive: publicity is a one-to-many spectacle as much as an ideal of mutual deliberation. The book’s conceptual upshot links with his broader thesis: when we confuse **communication** with **communion**, we weaponize speech in the name of freedom and rationality. The abyss image commits his project to an ethic of **responsible address**, resisting both censorious paternalism and shallow celebration of expressive liberty.

#### 6. Promiscuous Knowledge: information, images, and truth games
Co-authored with **Kenneth Cmiel**, **Promiscuous Knowledge** (2020) chronicles the modern proliferation of **information and images** and the corresponding fractures in **truth regimes**. The argument is historical and diagnostic: the twentieth century cultivated **truth games** in which **information**, **representation**, and **authority** circulated promiscuously across journalism, propaganda, science, and entertainment. The book extends the problematic of **miscommunication** to the level of epistemic ecologies, showing how plural media produce plural **veridiction**. Without collapsing into relativism, Peters notes that the desire for a sovereign **view from nowhere** fuels both technocratic fantasies and conspiracy feedback loops. The proposed antidote is not a purified epistemology but a **civic pedagogy of reception**, trained to weigh sources, attend to **infrastructures of circulation**, and practice **charity** toward the limits of knowledge. This volume complements the **elemental media** thesis by mapping the institutional habitats in which messages survive, mutate, and die.

#### 7. Conceptual architecture: address, failure, elementalism
Across these works, Peters builds a conceptual architecture anchored by three convictions. First, **address precedes understanding**: communication begins when a sender risks a word to a stranger. This shifts priority from **dialogue-as-consensus** to a discipline of **sending and receiving** under conditions of contingency and asymmetry. Second, **failure is structural**: drawing on **Augustine’s** reflections on the opacity of minds and **Kierkegaard’s** indirect communication, Peters insists that misfires are not defects to be engineered away but the normal mark of speech in time. Third, **elementalism over instrumentalism**: media are not simply tools but **worlds**, scaffolds of **dwelling** through which creatures breathe, move, and remember. These commitments allow Peters to recalibrate debates with **Habermas** and **Luhmann**. Where **Habermas** valorizes **communicative action** aimed at consensus, Peters valorizes **dissemination** and the ethics of risky address. Where **Luhmann** abstracts communication into system operations, Peters re-entangles communication with bodies, weather, and **infrastructures**. His style is aphoristic but learned, joining **Benjamin’s** montage with **McLuhan’s** environmental critique and extending them with a humane doctrine of **caritas**.

#### 8. Ambiguities, theological traction, and Reformed evaluation
Peters is not a systematic theologian, yet his project is theologically fecund. His **angelology of mediation** treats messengers as neither pure spirit nor mere mechanism, an image that resonates with **sacramentality** and challenges the fantasy of **unmediated presence**. His tragic axiom that **communication is not communion** chastens over-realized ecclesiologies that conflate **koinonia** with frictionless talk. His **elemental media** foreground **creaturely finitude** and the givenness of **creation** as milieu. Yet ambiguities persist. His metaphysics remains within an **immanent frame**, carefully bracketing transcendence and eschewing a robust **Creator-creature distinction**. His ethic of **caritas** and hospitality echoes Augustinian tones but lacks covenantal specification of **revelation** and **means of grace**. From a Reformed and WTS vantage, the strengths and limits clarify together. Positively, Peters provides an analytic of **fallen communication** and a doctrine of **ordinary mediation** that harmonize with **general revelation**, **common grace**, and a sober anthropology of **sin** and **limits**. His critique of the **conduit metaphor** supports a Reformed emphasis on the **verbum externum** and the concreteness of **Word and sacrament** as appointed media. His environmental turn invites a retrieval of **providence** as governance through created **means**. Critically, his elemental ontology risks collapsing **creation** into **media** without covenantal teleology, and his celebration of **dissemination** does not finally ground truth in **special revelation** governed by **sola Scriptura** and the **analogia fidei**. A Reformed alternative would affirm his account of structural misfire while insisting that the **Spirit’s** efficacious use of the **external Word** secures genuine **communion with Christ** through creaturely **mediation**, not despite it. The fault line is not mediation but authority: Peters offers an ethics of address within history; classical Reformed theology adds that the **triune God** binds address and reception in the covenant by the **means of grace**, thus promising what no human publicity can deliver.
