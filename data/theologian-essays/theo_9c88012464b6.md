### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
C. **Ben C. Blackwell** emerges within a late-modern **evangelical** milieu recalibrated by the **New Perspective on Paul** and by renewed attention to **Second Temple Judaism**, while simultaneously participating in a cross-confessional retrieval of the **patristic Great Tradition**. Educated in the British research environment in the late 2000s and now teaching at **Houston Christian University**, Blackwell’s training situates him at the seam where rigorous historical exegesis meets constructive **systematic theology**. His method unites three streams: first, detailed analysis of **Pauline** soteriology through epistolary exegesis; second, comparative work with **Second Temple** texts that supplies linguistic, conceptual, and narrative worlds for Paul; third, ressourcement of **patristic deification** concepts in dialogue with **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, and **the Cappadocians**. These together yield his hallmark category of **christosis**, a term that preserves **participation in Christ** as the determinative shape of transformation while resisting ontological collapse between Creator and creature. Blackwell’s intellectual context involves debates over **apocalyptic revelation** versus **salvation history**, over **forensic justification** versus **transformative participation**, and over the legitimacy of using **theosis** as a biblical-theological term. His interlocutors include **N. T. Wright** on narrative and covenant, **J. Louis Martyn** and **Beverly Gaventa** on apocalyptic rupture, and **Michael Gorman** on participation and cruciformity.

Blackwell’s method is confessional without being sectarian. In **Engaging Theology** he frames doctrinal discourse by the **rule of faith**, commending a canonical, creedal center that stabilizes evangelical identity while inviting learning from **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformation** witnesses. The resulting epistemic stance is chastened by historical criticism, yet unapologetic about the theological telos of Scripture. He treats **Second Temple** parallels as heuristic comparanda that constrain imagination without supplanting the **apostolic kerygma**, and he uses patristic **theosis** as a hermeneutical echo chamber to test and refine exegesis of **union with Christ**. The unity of method and aim appears especially where the language of **Spirit-mediated participation** grounds ecclesial formation and ethics.

#### 2. Christosis and Pauline soteriology
Blackwell’s central constructive statement, **Christosis** (2011), advances the thesis that Pauline salvation is best construed as transformative **participation in Christ** that culminates in glory, a process he names christosis to mark conformity to the **incarnate Son** as the definitive telos of human destiny. The title signals both continuity with **patristic deification** and a clarifying focus: for Paul, believers are conformed to Christ’s image through the **Spirit**, not assimilated to the divine essence. His key exegetical dossiers include **2 Corinthians 3:18** on being transformed from glory to glory, **Romans 8** on adoption, inheritance, and the conforming pattern of the **Firstborn**, **Philippians 2–3** on cruciform descent and exalted participation, and **1 Corinthians 15** on the transformation from **psychikos** to **pneumatikos** bodies. Blackwell argues that Paul speaks of a real participation that is both moral and ontological in the sense of Spirit-enabled embodiment, yet not metaphysical in the sense of an essence-sharing **metousia** with the divine nature. The intentional contrast is with reductive readings that flatten salvation into either purely **forensic justification** or disembodied **mysticism**.

To secure historical and theological balance, Blackwell juxtaposes Pauline texts with patristic interpreters, especially **Irenaeus’s recapitulation** and **Athanasius’s** maxim that God became human that humans might become god. He contends that these patristic accents illuminate Paul’s grammar of adoption, glorification, and **new creation** without importing an alien **Platonic ontology**. In his proposal, **christosis** allows evangelicals to receive **theosis** as Spirit-driven **conformation to Christ** rather than as ontological absorption, a move he ties to the **Creator-creature distinction** and to the eschatological reserve of Paul’s soteriology. The conceptual toolkit here includes **pneumatology**, **eschatology**, and **virtue formation**, all woven into a single tapestry defined by the **incarnation**, the **cross**, and the **resurrection**.

#### 3. Apocalyptic revelation within salvation history
A second axis of Blackwell’s contribution concerns the **apocalyptic Paul**, developed prominently in the edited volume **Paul and the Apocalyptic Imagination** (2016). In that collection, and in related essays, Blackwell maps the spectrum between the **Martyn-Gaventa** school, which emphasizes God’s invasive deliverance, and the **Wright-Barclay** school, which frames Paul within **Israel’s covenantal narrative**. His editorial leadership presses for a constructive both-and: **apocalyptic revelation** is not an antithesis to **salvation history** but its eschatological intensification. The cross and resurrection unveil the **righteousness of God** in a way that is discontinuous with human systems of worth yet continuous with **Abrahamic promise**. On this telling, Paul’s talk of new creation, the two ages, and enslavement to the powers is apocalyptic in idiom and scope, while his argumentation in **Romans** and **Galatians** is thoroughly embedded in **Torah**, **promise**, and **covenant**.

Blackwell thus resists zero-sum readings that oppose **forensic justification** to **participatory transformation**, or **gift** to **agency**, drawing here on discussions catalyzed by **John Barclay’s** work on the **incongruous gift**. For Blackwell, the divine apocalypse establishes a new sphere of life in the **Spirit**, within which believers are incorporated into Christ and walk by the Spirit in cruciform freedom. Far from abrogating history, apocalyptic disclosure re-narrates history under the sign of the **Messiah** and the **Spirit**, generating a teleology that is deeply ecclesial and sacramental in the sense of embodied practices of **baptism** and **Eucharist** conceived as participatory signs.

#### 4. Reading in Second Temple context
Blackwell’s pedagogical labor is most visible in the **Reading in Context** series, including **Reading Romans in Context** (2015), **Reading 1 Corinthians in Context** (2018), **Reading Revelation in Context** (2019), and **Reading Mark in Context** (2020), volumes he co-edited with **John K. Goodrich** and **Jason Maston**. The method is to pair NT pericopes with analogues from **Second Temple** sources such as **Qumran**, **1 Enoch**, **4 Ezra**, **Jubilees**, and **Wisdom**, thereby illustrating points of contact and difference. The pedagogical payoff is a textured feel for the **Jewish apocalyptic**, **sapiential**, and **legal** idioms within which early Christian proclamation took shape. Blackwell uses these comparisons not to relativize the canonical witness but to sharpen the **distinctive Christological** and **pneumatological** contributions of the NT authors.

These volumes also instantiate Blackwell’s catholic instincts. By showing how **Mark**, **Paul**, and **John of Patmos** speak within and against their Jewish environment, he invites readers to locate Christian doctrine within a lived history of promise, exile, and hope. The contextual labor becomes a hedge against anachronistic readings of **justification**, **law**, **faith**, and **works**, and a support for theological constructs like **participation in Christ** and **new covenant** life in the Spirit. In effect, Blackwell uses contextual studies to discipline the theologian’s imagination while opening doors for constructive retrieval.

#### 5. Engaging Theology and the evangelical rule of faith
With **Engaging Theology** (2019), co-authored for a broad evangelical audience, Blackwell articulates a doctrinal method grounded in the **creeds** and the **rule of faith**. The book structures loci around **Scripture**, **God**, **Christology**, **Pneumatology**, **Anthropology**, **Soteriology**, **Ecclesiology**, and **Eschatology**, integrating biblical exegesis, historical voices, and practical implication. The engine is catechetical: doctrine is confessed for the church’s worship and mission. Yet the approach is also ecumenical within orthodoxy, eager to learn from **patristic** metaphysics, **medieval** clarity, **Reformation** emphases on grace, and **Wesleyan** sanctification. Within soteriology Blackwell’s signature is again visible: **union with Christ** as the generating center that gathers **forensic justification**, **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **glorification** into a single economy.

A noteworthy feature is Blackwell’s insistence on the unity of **Scripture and tradition** under the primacy of Scripture. The **canonical narrative** authored by the triune God is read with the mind of the church, and the **creeds** serve as hermeneutical checks. Within this structure, the **theosis** of patristic theology appears as a legitimate, biblically resonant way to speak about **sanctification** and **glorification**, provided the **Creator-creature distinction** is maintained and the **Christological** and **pneumatological** means are foregrounded. The result is an evangelical theology alert to **sacramentality**, moral formation, and the church’s life in the world.

#### 6. Doctrinal development: union, ethics, and ecclesial participation
The doctrinal logic of Blackwell’s corpus coheres around **union with Christ** as both status and state, both forensic and transformative. Drawing on the Pauline triad of **in Christ**, **with Christ**, and **through the Spirit**, he frames justification as participation in Christ’s faithful obedience, adoption as sharing the Son’s filial status, sanctification as Spirit-enabled **cruciformity**, and glorification as **christosis** consummated in resurrection bodies. He is sympathetic to **Michael Gorman’s** language of **participation and transformation**, though he guards the evangelical insistence on the alien righteousness of Christ by keeping **imputation** conceptually integrated within union. The ecclesial corollaries include a vision of **baptism** as incorporation, **Eucharist** as ongoing participation in the crucified and risen Lord, and communal ethics as **Spirit**-empowered virtue formed under Christ’s lordship.

Blackwell’s attention to ethics integrates **virtue** discourse with apocalyptic deliverance. Freedom from the powers is matched by formation into **agape** through communal practices. The church’s witness is thereby political in the modest classic sense, a public embodiment of **new creation**. In his edited work on **Revelation**, he showcases how apocalyptic imagery forms a non-accommodating people loyal to the **Lamb**. This construal of ethics is not moralism but **sanctification** as the fruit of life in Christ, ordered to mission and worship.

#### 7. Interlocutors: patristic deification, modern Pauline debates, and safeguards
Because **theosis** sits at the center of misunderstanding between evangelical Protestants and the patristic tradition, Blackwell constructs careful safeguards. He follows **Norman Russell** in distinguishing **metaphorical**, **ethical**, and **realistic** uses of deification, adopting a **realistic** but non-essentialist account: through the **Spirit**, believers truly participate in divine life by grace, are conformed to the image of the **Son**, and share in divine **glory**, yet do not cross the ontological line that belongs to God alone. Unlike some modern Orthodox articulations that rely heavily on an **essence-energies distinction**, Blackwell keeps his account thoroughly **Christological** and **pneumatological**, resonant with **Irenaeus’s recapitulation** and **Athanasius’s soteriology**. He is in conversation with **Grant Macaskill** on union and election, and with **N. T. Wright** on covenantal monotheism, even as he appreciates **J. Louis Martyn’s** emphasis on divine invasion and **Beverly Gaventa’s** focus on the God who rescues.

In the justification debates, Blackwell is not a polemicist. He affirms **forensic justification** while arguing that Paul’s soteriology cannot be collapsed into a legal metaphor. The **faithfulness of Christ** and **Spirit-led participation** supply the texture that holds together status and transformation. His editorial work on **Paul and the Apocalyptic Imagination** shows his posture: convene strong voices, resist false dichotomies, and let the **apostolic** texts speak within their **Jewish** and **Greco-Roman** contexts. That posture is itself methodological counsel to evangelical theology: pursue catholic breadth under biblical authority.

#### 8. Institutional and pedagogical influence
Beyond monographs and edited volumes, Blackwell’s influence is institutional and pedagogical. At **Houston Christian University**, he has shaped programs that integrate **biblical studies** and **systematic theology**, echoing his conviction that exegesis and doctrine must coexist in the classroom and the church. The **Reading in Context** series serves the guild and the church by democratizing access to **Second Temple** comparanda, and **Engaging Theology** provides a catechetical on-ramp to the **rule of faith**. His work on **Revelation** and **Mark** in context shows that his method is not limited to Paul but can traverse the canon with the same **apocalyptic**, **pneumatological**, and **ecclesial** instincts.

Blackwell’s wider impact includes a gentle reintroduction of **theosis** into evangelical parlance, not as a shibboleth but as a biblically grounded metaphor for **sanctification** and **glorification**. By anchoring **theosis** in **participation in Christ** and in the **Spirit**, he disarms caricatures while preserving evangelical distinctives. The long-term effect is a generation of students and readers for whom **union with Christ** functions as an architectonic principle across doctrinal loci.

#### 9. Assessment and synthesis
Taken together, the contributions of **Christosis**, the **apocalyptic** volume, the **Reading in Context** series, and **Engaging Theology** form a coherent theological vision. The through-line is this: the triune God unveils his **righteousness** in the **Messiah**, incorporating a people by the **Spirit** into the Son, thereby effecting both **forensic acquittal** and **transformative participation** that issue in ecclesial holiness and eschatological **glory**. Historically, this vision honors the Jewish texture of the apostolic proclamation while receiving the **patristic** grammar of deification as a disciplined way to articulate Paul’s soteriology. Methodologically, it models how **exegesis**, **contextual studies**, and **dogmatics** may work in concert under the **rule of faith**. Pastorally, it equips the church for cruciform fidelity in late-modern culture, fortified by the apocalyptic hope of the **Lamb’s** victory.

From a **Reformed/WTS evaluation**, several commendations and cautions arise. First, his centering of **union with Christ** aligns with classic **Reformed** teaching on the duplex gratia, where justification and sanctification flow from union. His careful maintenance of the **Creator-creature distinction** largely averts worries about ontological confusion in **theosis**, and his ecclesial-pedagogical emphasis on the **rule of faith** resonates with a confessional, catholic Reformed posture. Second, two tensions require note. One, the rhetoric of **christosis** can, in less careful hands, eclipse the primacy of **forensic justification** as definitive, legal, and once-for-all. Reformed theology will insist that the **imputed righteousness of Christ** retains logical priority within union, such that participatory transformation never underwrites assurance. Two, in adjudicating between **apocalyptic** and **salvation-historical** emphases, Reformed **covenant theology** will stress the unity and continuity of the **covenants** as the matrix for reading Paul, wary of idioms that sound like radical discontinuity. The Reformed alternative is a thick **federal** account of union, wherein participation is grounded in **Christ’s federal headship** and administered by the **Spirit** through Word and sacrament, with **theosis** reframed as **communicatio gratiarum** rather than any hint of essence-participation. Within these guardrails, Blackwell’s project offers fruitful stimulus for Reformed exegesis and systematics to recover a more robust doctrine of **union with Christ** without sacrificing **justification by faith** or **covenantal** integrity.
