### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the Augustinian turn
Keith E. Johnson emerged within contemporary **evangelical** theology at the intersection of academic dogmatics and the **missional** imperatives of global ministry. His vocational location in the theological development of **Cru** placed him at the seam between the university and the church, requiring a grammar capable of instructing practitioners while meeting the standards of **systematic theology**. The historical context that formed his work was the late twentieth and early twenty-first century reassessment of the **Trinity** in evangelical circles, itself a retrieval of **pro-Nicene** dogma spearheaded by a generation conversant with **patristics** and the **ressourcement** movement. The intellectual pressures were twofold. First, the rise of bold **religious pluralism** projects after 1989, with **John Hick** and **Paul Knitter** as emblematic, contested Christian claims to the uniqueness of Christ and the Triune God. Second, the professionalization of theology in the academy threatened to detach **doctrine** from **discipleship**. Johnson answers both pressures by entrenching his method in **Augustine**, drawing on a sapiential account of knowledge and a thick account of the **church** as the sphere of **participatio** in God.

Johnson’s formation cohered around the conviction that **dogmatic theology** must be ecclesial, practical, and doxological, not merely analytic or historicist. The basic wager of his oeuvre is that **Augustine’s** moral-ascetical vision of knowing, loving, and worshiping God can re-order evangelical doctrinal work under the rule of the **Trinity**. He therefore privileges the biblical canon read under the **regula fidei**, the cultivation of **virtues** of attention and charity, and the alignment of theological reasoning with the **ordo amoris**. In modern terms, Johnson proposes an alternative epistemic stance to both foundationalist apologetics and postmodern suspicion. He re-centers **illumination**, insists on the **Spirit’s** role in teaching, and frames theology as the sanctification of intellect within the **communio sanctorum**.

#### 2. Method as discipleship: sapientia, canon, and the moral psychology of knowing
The methodological cornerstone of Johnson’s project is articulated in **Theology as Discipleship** 2015. There he contrasts a research-driven model of **scientia** with a **sapiential** model in which truth is inseparable from the process of being conformed to Christ. Drawing on **Augustine’s** *De doctrina christiana* and **De Trinitate**, he frames theological knowledge as rightly ordered **enjoyment** of God, with all created goods used **uti** toward the **frui** of the Triune Lord. Theological reasoning is not neutral inquiry but the Spirit-enabled habitus of a people schooled by **Scripture**, governed by the **creeds**, and formed by **catechesis** and **liturgy**. This yields an epistemic humility that still dares to confess **homoousios** and **hypostatic** clarity because the church is drawn into the Son’s knowledge of the Father in the **Spirit**.

Within this **Augustinian** frame, Johnson retrieves the moral psychology of **idolatry** as a cognitive vice. Disordered loves distort perception, which explains both the fragility of faith and the tenacity of error. The cure is sanctification of attention, the cultivation of **caritas**, and immersion in the canon under the **regula fidei**. Johnson’s use of **participatio** is patristic rather than modern metaphysical system building. Creatures participate in God through union with Christ by the **Spirit**, which means doctrine functions pedagogically to guide the church’s participation, not as speculative theory. This is theology as **discipled reason**, a disciplined, ascetical wisdom oriented to the **beatific** end.

#### 3. Rethinking the Trinity and religious pluralism: an Augustinian assessment
Johnson’s first major monograph, **Rethinking the Trinity and Religious Pluralism** 2011, addresses the postwar surge in theological models that relativize Christ or transmute the **Trinity** into a metaphor for the transcendent **Real**. He reads **John Hick’s** turn from Christ’s uniqueness to the noumenal Real as a sustained re-description of Christian belief that evacuates **incarnation** and **atonement** of dogmatic content. He treats **Karl Rahner’s** **anonymous Christian** and **Clark Pinnock’s** **inclusivism** as fraught attempts to secure the universal scope of grace without surrendering the specific economy of the **Son** and **Spirit**. Against these options Johnson offers an **Augustinian** reframing: pluralism is not primarily a puzzle of epistemic access but of **worship**, **desire**, and **idolatry**. The question is whom we enjoy as ultimate. If, with **Augustine**, the human heart is restless until it rests in God, then religious diversity must be assessed with the grammar of **ordo amoris** and **frui/uti**.

The constructive center of the 2011 work is a retrieval of **De Trinitate** as both doctrine and pedagogy for engaging the religions. Johnson tightens the link between **Trinity** and **mission** by showing that the Father sends the Son and the **Spirit** to draw nations into the life of God. The **homoousios** of the Son with the Father and the **consubstantiality** of the Spirit are not negotiable boundary markers but the very grammar of salvation. Johnson resists reducing the Trinity to a symbol of relationality and refuses a **social trinitarianism** that could function as a loose umbrella for interfaith recognition. He argues for **Christocentric exclusivity** coupled with **charity** in dialogue. That charity is not a thin civility but the evangelical virtue that seeks the true good of neighbors by bearing witness to the **Triune** God who alone can be enjoyed as ultimate. The upshot is a missionary posture that is hospitable yet confessional, marked by prayerful dependence on the **Spirit** for illumination and conversion.

#### 4. The canon under the creed: Scripture, tradition, and catechesis
A consistent thread in Johnson’s method is the coupling of **Scripture** with **tradition** without collapsing one into the other. Following **Augustine’s** reading practices, he insists that the canon is authoritative as the speech of the **Triune** God, while the **creeds** and **catechisms** are tools of ecclesial wisdom that constrain and guide interpretation. In **Theology as Discipleship** he insists on the primacy of the biblical story of creation, Israel, and Christ, yet he deploys the **regula fidei** to secure **divine simplicity**, **impassibility** rightly qualified, and the **inseparable operations** of the divine persons. Doctrinal retrieval is not antiquarianism but the recovery of conceptual tools that underwrite **christological** and **pneumatological** clarity for the church on mission.

Johnson’s hermeneutic thus refuses both biblicist flattening and traditionalist nostalgia. He studies the **fathers** and the **Reformers** as schoolmasters in wisdom. The result is a constructive evangelical dogmatics that prizes **catechesis**. For Johnson, catechesis is not pre-theological propaedeutic. It is the form in which doctrine enters the bones of a people, producing the virtues necessary for perceiving and confessing the **Trinity**. He stresses **prayer**, **fasting**, and **corporate worship** as disciplines that shape the theologian’s sight, rendering **illumination** not a concept but a lived dependence on the **Spirit** of truth. Doctrine becomes, for him, an instrument of sanctification and a charter for mission.

#### 5. Interlocutors and debates: pluralism, retrieval, and evangelical identity
Johnson’s projects are threaded through with careful engagements of principal figures and movements. On **religious pluralism**, **John Hick** is the focal foil. Johnson exposes the cost of Hick’s metaphysical **Real** and contrasts it with the **Triune** economy of Father, Son, and Spirit. He engages **Rahner** with respect, receiving his insistence on the unity of **economic** and **immanent** Trinity while rejecting the pluralist drift of the **anonymous Christian** thesis. With **Clark Pinnock**, he acknowledges the generosity of God’s grace but resists reconstruals that erode the necessity of explicit **faith** in Christ. Johnson is in conversation with **Lesslie Newbigin** on mission, sharing Newbigin’s critique of Western epistemic arrogance and his confidence in the scandalous particularity of **Christ**.

Within evangelical dogmatics, Johnson’s method intersects with the retrieval programs of **John Webster**, **Kevin Vanhoozer**, and **Fred Sanders**. He sides with **Webster** in affirming the holiness of theology and the primacy of **revelation** as the divine self-communication that grounds dogmatics. He appreciates **Vanhoozer’s** canonical-linguistic account while pressing for stronger ecclesial-ascetical formation. He joins **Sanders** in insisting on the evangelical urgency of **Nicene** trinitarianism as the structuring center of the gospel. Where **social trinitarian** proposals threaten to dissolve **inseparable operations** or blur **divine simplicity**, Johnson retrieves **pro-Nicene** grammar to safeguard the unity of the **Triune** act.

#### 6. Doctrinal architecture: Trinity, desire, and mission
Johnson’s doctrinal core is the **Trinity** in relation to human **desire** and **mission**. He reads **Augustine’s** account of love not as a psychological analogy to be mined for speculative precision alone, but as a deep anthropology: humans are ordered to God and are deformed by **idolatry**. This anthropology sets the stage for his account of the **gospel**. The Father elects, the **Son** redeems, the **Spirit** perfects, and the church is gathered into this economy for the purpose of glorifying God and enjoying him forever. Salvation is participation **participatio** by grace in the life of God, not ontological promotion but filial adoption through **union with Christ**. Mission is the church’s extension of this Triune sending into the world, enacted in proclamation, sacrificial service, and patient dialogue that refuses to cede the uniqueness of **Jesus**.

Johnson’s retrieval pays dividends in the contested arena of **religions**. He insists that the choice is not between arrogant exclusivism and relativist pluralism. The **Augustinian** third way is a confessional humility that refuses idolatry, confesses the **Trinity**, and invites all peoples to the **beatific** end. This position requires clear dogma. Hence Johnson’s strong commitments to **homoousios**, **inseparable operations**, and a robust account of **divine simplicity** that avoids both modalism and tritheism. The Trinity is not pragmatic window dressing for mission. It is the grammar of mission. Without it, the church cannot say who saves or how.

#### 7. The theologian’s craft: pedagogy, virtues, and public witness
In Johnson’s vision, theological pedagogy is a craft shaped by the **virtues**. He calls for the formation of theologians who are teachers of **wisdom**, not merely specialists. The theologian is a servant of the **church** who prays, repents, and reads under the **regula fidei**. Such a theologian can speak with confidence about **Christ’s** uniqueness in public without adopting either a defensive posture or an accommodating ambiguity. In this, Johnson models a mode of public theology in which **doctrine** is not walled off from practice. Instead, doctrine orders practice by making God the end of all Christian speech and action. This mode yields a distinctive evangelical identity, neither culture-war rhetoric nor assimilated liberalism, but **orthodoxy** on mission.

A notable aspect of Johnson’s craft is his insistence that theological clarity blesses the church’s witness. The retrieval of **pro-Nicene** grammar does not close engagement. It makes engagement intelligible. Because Father, **Son**, and **Spirit** are one God, the church can parse religious claims by their capacity to be ordered to the enjoyment of the Triune Lord. Because of **inseparable operations**, the church can discern movements of grace in the world without collapsing **nature** and **grace**. Johnson’s pedagogy thus teaches discernment, the habit of testing the spirits while pursuing the good of neighbors in love.

#### 8. Reception, influence, and the evangelical landscape
Johnson’s work has gained traction in evangelical seminaries and among practitioners tasked with forming leaders for **mission**. **Theology as Discipleship** has been used to reframe curricula around **catechesis**, **virtue**, and ecclesial practices, pushing back against the fragmentation of theological disciplines. **Rethinking the Trinity and Religious Pluralism** has served as a guide for campus ministers, missionaries, and pastors seeking confessional clarity in interfaith contexts. His insistence on **patristic** retrieval has situated him within a broader evangelical turn to **classical theism**, yet his Augustinian accent keeps the project pastorally grounded rather than merely metaphysical.

Theologically, Johnson has contributed to stabilizing evangelical **trinitarian** discourse after debates about eternal relations and the **immanent** life of God that surfaced in the 2010s. By holding fast to **inseparable operations** and refusing social analogies that compromise **divine simplicity**, he has offered a dogmatic backbone for evangelical proclamation. Simultaneously, his missional posture remains irenic and hospitable, echoing **Newbigin’s** call for confidence without triumphalism. In this way, Johnson’s influence is both conceptual and practical, shaping a generation of ministers to see **doctrine** as the grammar of their lives and labors.

#### 9. Strengths, risks, and open questions within the Augustinian program
The strengths of Johnson’s project are evident. His **Augustinian** ressourcement grounds **evangelical** theology in a tradition deep enough to weather modern storms. His account of knowledge as **discipleship** restores the unity of truth and holiness, better reflecting the **Spirit’s** role in the life of the mind. His centering of the **Trinity** corrects the functional unitarianism that sometimes mars evangelical practice. His analysis of **religious pluralism** avoids the false binary between arrogance and relativism by retrieving **ordo amoris** and the grammar of **frui/uti**. By pressing for **catechesis**, he strikes at the root of evangelical amnesia and offers a pathway for durable formation.

There are risks and open questions. The Augustinian stress on **desire** and **idolatry** explains much, but it may risk under-describing the complex historical and social dynamics of religions. The account of **participatio** is chastened and ecclesial, yet it could benefit from further systematic integration with doctrines of **creation**, **providence**, and **sacrament** to avoid misunderstanding as vague mysticism. Practically, the call for **catechesis** demands institutional supports many evangelical contexts lack. Finally, while Johnson refuses thin **social trinitarianism**, further exposition of **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **eternal generation** in close exegesis would ensure that his retrieval is not only canonical in tone but rigorously exegetical in grounding.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Johnson’s project is largely convergent in spirit and often in substance. His centering of the **Trinity**, insistence on **Scripture** under the **regula fidei**, and stress on **illumination** resonate with a **covenantal** epistemology that treats knowledge of God as dependent on divine initiative and the **Spirit’s** work. His critique of **religious pluralism** aligns with Reformed **particularism** and the antithesis between **covenant** fidelity and **idolatry**, while his pastoral charity mirrors the doctrine of **common grace**. Two tensions remain. First, to safeguard **sola Scriptura** as principium externum, Reformed theology would press more sharply the distinction between **Scripture** as the norming norm and **tradition** as normed norm, ensuring that **catechesis** and **creed** serve but never rival the self-authenticating Word and its **inerrancy**. Second, a Westminster inflection would integrate Johnson’s **ordo amoris** more explicitly with the **covenant of grace**, **effectual calling**, and the **means of grace** word and sacrament, so that epistemic sanctification is tethered to **preaching** and **supper** as the ordinary conduits of **union with Christ**. Where Johnson occasionally accents moral-ascetical formation, a Reformed alternative tightens the law-gospel distinction, clarifies the forensic ground of assurance through **justification**, and frames mission as the ordained extension of Christ’s **mediatorial kingship** in history. In sum, Johnson offers a robustly catholic evangelical proposal that Reformed theology can readily own, hone, and deploy within its stronger doctrinal architecture of **covenant**, **grace**, and **means**.
