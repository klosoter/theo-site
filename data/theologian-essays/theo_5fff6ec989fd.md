### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Ken Wilson is a contemporary **evangelical** physician-scholar whose work arose amid renewed **Calvinist** and **non-Calvinist** contestation in the early twenty-first century, especially the post-2007 New Calvinism resurgence and the Southern Baptist debates over **unconditional election**. Trained in medicine and later completing an **Oxford DPhil** in 2018, Wilson addressed a long-standing historical-theological question: how did **Augustine** move from early anti-Manichaean defenses of **liberum arbitrium** to the mature anti-Pelagian doctrine of **predestination** that later nourished **Calvin** and the **Reformed** confessions. The thesis he presses in both academic and popular formats is that late Augustine effected a decisive conceptual shift from what Wilson calls **traditional free choice** to **non-free free will**. The latter category, tied to **compatibilism**, construes freedom as voluntariness under determining causes, and Wilson argues this was foreign to the earlier catholic consensus. The historical setting of Wilson’s work is thus both late antique debates over **fate** and **providence** and the contemporary evangelical need to adjudicate between **monergism** and **synergism** in soteriology.

Methodologically, Wilson combines a reception history of **patristic** sources with philological attention to Greek **autexousion** and Latin **liberum arbitrium**, as well as a comparative analysis of **Stoic determinism** and **Manichaean fatalism**. He asserts that the pre-Augustinian Church uniformly taught a robust moral **self-determination** and resisted fatalistic causal chains, while Augustine, pressed by the **Pelagian** controversy and concerns such as **original sin** and **infant baptism**, reconfigured freedom as willing necessity under an infallible **ordo causarum** within divine **providence**. Wilson’s method is genealogical in that he traces how this late-Augustinian configuration traveled through **Prosper of Aquitaine**, **Fulgentius**, medieval Augustinianism, the **Reformation**, and into **Augustinian-Calvinism**, including the **Westminster Confession**.

#### 2. The patristic backdrop: a claimed consensus on traditional free choice
The core historical claim in Wilson’s corpus is that the pre-412 Christian tradition, Greek and Latin alike, affirmed **traditional free choice** as a substantive capacity for alternative possibilities, and that this affirmation was tightly linked to the goodness of God’s **justice**, the sincerity of universal gospel calls, and the rejection of **fatalism**. He highlights repeatedly the patristic deployment of **autexousion** in **Justin Martyr**, **Irenaeus**, **Origen**, **Gregory of Nyssa**, and **John Chrysostom**, and the parallel Latin insistence on **liberum arbitrium** in **Tertullian**, **Cyprian**, and early **Ambrose**. On Wilson’s reading, these sources connect human responsibility to a freedom not merely from coercion but also from necessitating internal or external causes, and they exegete key texts, including **Romans 9**, in corporate or vocational categories rather than as individual **unconditional election** to eternal life. The early Church’s polemics against **Gnostic** and **Manichaean** opponents serve for Wilson as the control: fatalistic or naturalistic necessity is the hallmark of the heretical systems, whereas catholic orthodoxy defends a grace-enabled but resistible moral agency.

Within this framework, Wilson underscores that pre-Augustinian liturgical practice and catechesis presupposed meaningful **repentance** and **assent** that could be refused, and that pre-Pelagian councils did not codify **irresistible grace** or **double predestination**. He reads the early fathers’ appeals to **divine foreknowledge** as non-determining cognition grounded in God’s eternity rather than as an ontological order that necessitates human choice. The conceptual network that dominates this earlier period, on his account, includes **prevenient grace** as enablement, human **synergy** in sanctification, and an anti-fatalist rejection of **heimarmene**. This background furnishes the backdrop against which Wilson frames Augustine’s transformation from **traditional free choice** to a compatibilist, nature-determined **non-free free will**.

#### 3. Augustine’s development: from anti-Manichaean to anti-Pelagian
Wilson’s historical narrative turns on the two-stage development in **Augustine**. First, in the anti-Manichaean period, texts such as **De Libero Arbitrio** and the early anti-fatalist arguments in **De Civitate Dei** present Augustine as a defender of **liberum arbitrium** and a critic of both **Stoic determinism** and **Manichaean fatalism**. He appeals to Augustine’s insistence that moral evil is a defect of the will, not an alien substance, and that God’s **providence** does not coerce the will. Here Augustine aligns closely with the **patristic** consensus Wilson describes, maintaining that divine **foreknowledge** does not necessitate acts and that grace restores and aids rather than irresistibly determines.

Second, Wilson locates a decisive shift in Augustine’s anti-Pelagian period beginning around 412, maturing after 418. He treats the letter to **Simplicianus** on **Romans 9** as a transitional piece and argues that the decisive codification comes in Augustine’s late works: **De spiritu et littera** 412, **De correptione et gratia** 426–427, **De praedestinatione sanctorum** 428–429, **De dono perseverantiae** 428–429, along with the **Enchiridion** and the **Retractationes**. In these, Augustine advances **unconditional election**, the **donum perseverantiae** as a grace given only to some, and the language of humanity as a **massa damnata** such that the wonder is not why some are passed over but why any are saved. He reconceives freedom as the will acting from its strongest inclination, now enslaved by **concupiscentia** unless liberated by **gratia efficax**, thus introducing what Wilson labels **non-free free will**.

A crucial element in Wilson’s reading is Augustine’s redeployment of the **ordo causarum** and the distinction between **fate** and **providence**. Augustine rejects astro-logical **fate**, yet posits an infallible order of causes governed by God’s will, in which even human choices are part of a predetermined nexus. Wilson claims that this compatibilist framework is substantively a Christianized **Stoic determinism**, now baptized in the language of **providence** and **predestination**. The shift is not merely semantic but soteriological: grace becomes **irresistible**, calling becomes **effectual**, and the scope of salvific love becomes selective in line with **double predestination** or at least a functional asymmetry of grace and reprobation.

#### 4. Exegetical flashpoints and doctrinal consolidation
Wilson’s historical proposal is joined to exegetical claims regarding contested texts. On **Romans 9**, he argues that the early fathers, including **Chrysostom** and **Origen**, interpreted Paul corporately with respect to Israel and the Gentiles, focusing on **vocation** and historical roles rather than decretal **individual election** to salvation. Augustine’s later reading, however, becomes the prototype for **Calvin** and **Reformed** exegesis that sees **Jacob and Esau** as emblematic of unconditional, pretemporal choices of persons. Similarly, **John 6** is treated by Wilson as a discourse about faithful Israel’s remnant and the pedagogical drawing of the Father, not an ontological account of **irresistible grace**. He reads **1 Timothy 2:4** and **2 Peter 3:9** in their plain universal sense, buttressing his claim that earlier catholic theology assumed a universal salvific will harmonized with resistible **prevenient grace**.

Doctrinally, Wilson sees Augustine’s late position as the fountainhead of what he calls **Augustinian-Calvinism**, a trajectory that redefines **liberum arbitrium** as freedom from coercion rather than freedom for contrary choice, construes **foreknowledge** as entailing **predestination**, and frames redemption in terms of an elect remnant chosen **ante praevisa merita**. The late Augustine supplies the conceptual apparatus for **effectual calling**, **irresistible grace**, and **perseverance** as a distinct **donum**, themes he sees echoed in **Prosper**, **Fulgentius**, medieval Augustinians, and finally systematized by **Calvin** and confessionalized in the **Westminster Standards**. In Wilson’s map, the medieval Council of **Orange** 529 is read as affirming **prevenient grace** against **Pelagianism** but not endorsing Augustinian **irresistibility**, reinforcing his claim that strict **Augustinian-Calvinism** is not ecumenically normative.

#### 5. The works and their rhetorical force
Wilson’s **Oxford DPhil thesis** in 2018 offers the detailed apparatus: catalogues of patristic usage of **autexousion** and **liberum arbitrium**, timelines of Augustine’s terminological shifts, and sustained comparisons with **Manichaean** sources and **Stoic** arguments. He employs careful translations, tracks the semantic drift from **libertas** as rectitude to **liberum arbitrium** as capacity, and then to a **non-free free will** defined as voluntariness under necessity. The thesis is followed by a 2019 popularization, **The Foundation of Augustinian-Calvinism**, which distills the academic claims for a broader **evangelical** audience and adds polemical edge against **Calvinist** readings of **Paul**. These works function both descriptively and normatively, inviting readers to retrieve a **pre-Augustinian** soteriology of resistible grace and universal atonement in continuity with **Irenaeus**, **Origen**, and **Chrysostom**.

A distinctive contribution is Wilson’s taxonomy of causes and freedom. He argues that the Augustinian logic of **infallible foreknowledge** leading to a fixed **ordo causarum** collapses human spontaneity into a derivative effect, echoing **Stoic** compatibilism in which assent follows character in a necessitated chain. The counterpoint for Wilson is the patristic portrait in which divine **providence** ordains ends without necessitating moral acts, and grace genuinely enables without constraining. This conceptual polemic helps explain the rhetorical voltage of his project among **non-Calvinist evangelicals**, who see in Wilson’s narrative a historical warrant for **libertarian** or at least **synenergistic** freedom.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
Wilson’s interlocutors span late antiquity to modern theology. In antiquity, **Augustine**, **Pelagius**, **John Cassian**, **Prosper**, and **Fulgentius** occupy center stage, with the Greek fathers **Origen** and **Chrysostom** serving as foils to Augustinian determinism. In modern scholarship, he dialogues with **Peter Brown** on Augustine’s psychology and pastoral context, with **Gerald Bonner** and **John Rist** on Augustine’s shifting soteriology, and with **Robert Markus** and **Carol Harrison** on providence, creation, and the ascent of the soul. Wilson positions himself against the stream that sees continuity from early Augustine to late treatises, insisting instead on a genuine doctrinal reversal under pressure of the **Pelagian** crisis and the pastoral problem of **infant baptism** and **original guilt**.

Reception has been polarized. In **evangelical** circles critical of **Calvinism**, Wilson’s work has been amplified through platforms like **Leighton Flowers** and the **Provisionist** movement, used to claim that **Augustinian-Calvinism** is historically novel and exegetically tendentious. In **Reformed** apologetics, figures like **James White** and academic theologians in the **Augustinian** tradition have countered that Wilson confuses **fate** with **providence**, mischaracterizes **compatibilist freedom**, and overlooks Augustine’s sustained anti-Manichaean distinctions. Patristic specialists have queried the breadth of Wilson’s asserted patristic consensus, noting complexities in **Origen** on preexistence and **Chrysostom** on grace and will, while acknowledging that the Greek East remained wary of **double predestination**.

#### 7. Doctrinal entailments and constructive thrust
Wilson’s historical claims carry doctrinal entailments aimed at contemporary **soteriology**. If the pre-412 consensus is rightly characterized as **traditional free choice** aided by **prevenient grace**, and if late **Augustine** uniquely introduces **non-free free will** and **irresistible grace**, then **Calvinist** predestinarianism appears as a historically bounded option rather than catholic consensus. Wilson thus urges a retrieval of **synergistic** accounts of **regeneration** and **sanctification** in which grace is necessary and prior but not coercive, the atonement is **unlimited** in intent, and election is **corporate** in Christ with outcomes contingent upon persevering faith. He appeals to the integrity of the universal divine salvific will in **1 Timothy 2:4** and to pastoral exhortation grounded in genuine alternative possibilities, against the pastoral logic of **massa damnata** and fixed **ordo salutis** that secures perseverance by selective donation of the **donum perseverantiae**.

In this constructive angle, Wilson offers a counternarrative to **Augustinian-Calvinism** that claims patristic catholicity for a resistible, all-embracing grace, while keeping divine **providence** sovereign over history without entailing **determinism**. The aim is not antiquarianism but a re-centering of the theological grammar of **freedom**, **grace**, and **judgment** for an **evangelical** church fractured by inherited polemics.

#### 8. Final assessment and Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Wilson’s work is a welcome prompt to recalibrate historical claims, yet it raises substantive concerns in method and doctrine. First, the conflation of **compatibilist freedom** with **determinism** risks erasing long-standing Reformed distinctions between **necessitas consequentiae** and **coactio**, between **primary and secondary causality**, and between **voluntas naturalis** and **libera**. Augustine’s and the Reformed tradition’s claim is that grace is **efficax** without violating the mode of the will; Wilson’s category of **non-free free will** obscures this by defining freedom as alternative possibilities rather than as rational spontaneity under **providence**. Second, the genetic charge that late Augustine baptized **Stoic** and **Manichaean** motifs courts the genetic fallacy; the Reformed defense insists that Augustine’s rejection of **fate** and articulation of **ordo causarum** are christologically and biblically normed, not philosophically captive. Third, on exegesis, the **Reformed** reading of **Romans 9** and **John 6** is not a mere Augustinian inheritance but a direct engagement with Pauline **election**, divine **hardening**, and the **effectual drawing** of the Father; corporate horizons are affirmed within a **covenantal** frame while maintaining the text’s individual particularity. Fourth, patristic appeals must be chastened by the Reformed principle of **Scriptura sui ipsius interpres**; catholic testimony is valued but normativity belongs to canon, not consensus. Finally, pastorally, the **Westminster** doctrine of **effectual calling** and **perseverance** safeguards assurance in the **covenant of grace** while preserving genuine responsibility through the doctrine of **concursus** and means-of-grace exhortations. A constructive alternative thus maintains **divine simplicity** and sovereign **providence** with robust secondary causes, affirms both corporate and individual **election**, and reads **prevenient grace** at **Orange** as an anti-Pelagian curb rather than a denial of **irresistible grace**, preserving the Augustinian insight without collapsing into **fatalism**.
