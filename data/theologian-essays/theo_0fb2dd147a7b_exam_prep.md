### TITLE
B. B. Warfield is the high-water mark of Old Princeton Reformed orthodoxy, whose robust doctrine of **inspiration** and defense of **Christ’s person and work** remain indispensable, even as his evidentialist method must be carefully qualified from a Westminster perspective.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **B. B. Warfield** (1851–1921) stands at the climax of **Old Princeton** and faces the rise of **higher criticism** and **liberal Protestantism** in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
- Situated in the American **Reformed Presbyterian** world at **Princeton Seminary**, he lives through the **Fundamentalist–Modernist** tensions that will eventually fracture the mainline churches.

- Methodologically, Warfield is a champion of **scientific theology**, arguing in **“The Idea of Systematic Theology” (1896)** that theology is a science grounded in revealed facts logically ordered.
- He practices a fairly strong **evidentialist apologetic**, defending **Revelation** and the **resurrection** by marshaling historical and rational proofs against **Ritschlian** and **liberal** critics.
- While deeply confessional, his method leans on **common-sense realism** and **Scottish philosophy**, assuming that redeemed and unredeemed minds share access to the same foundational **laws of thought**.

- In **“The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible” (posthumous 1948, essays 1880s–1915)**, Warfield defends verbal plenary **inspiration** and inerrancy in the face of **higher criticism**.
- In **“The Person and Work of Christ” (1908)**, a collection of essays and sermons, he expounds classic **Chalcedonian Christology** and defends Christ’s deity and uniqueness against **liberal Christologies**.
- In **“Counterfeit Miracles” (1918)**, he targets **Roman Catholic** and **Pentecostal** miracle claims, arguing that biblical **miracles** were signs of canonical revelation and have ceased.
- In **“Calvin and Augustine” (1905)** and related essays, he interprets Reformed **predestinarian** theology as a flowering of **Augustinian** grace over against **Pelagian** and **semi-Pelagian** tendencies.

- Warfield’s most decisive doctrinal loci are **revelation and Scripture**, especially **inspiration and inerrancy**, where he becomes a standard-bearer for conservative Protestantism.
- He is also foundational in **Christology** and **soteriology**, defending substitutionary **atonement** and the full **deity** and humanity of Christ against modern revisionism.
- His essays on **election**, **regeneration**, and **perseverance** articulate a strong **Augustinian–Calvinist** monergism that shapes later Reformed debates about grace.
- Warfield has a lasting impact on **church and culture** questions through his engagement with **evolution**, **miracles**, and **Roman Catholicism**, modeling a learned polemical style.

- For a Westminster exam, you must present Warfield as a largely faithful **Reformed orthodox** theologian whose defense of **Scripture** and **Christology** is to be gratefully received.
- You must also signal awareness that his **evidentialism** and **natural theology** require correction in light of **Van Til** and a consistently **presuppositional** epistemology.

- When pressed, compare Warfield’s doctrine of **Scripture** and method with **Calvin vs. Warfield** on the internal testimony of the Spirit and with **Warfield vs. Van Til** on apologetics.
- It is also helpful to set **Warfield and Bavinck** alongside **Schleiermacher and Ritschl**, showing how Old Princeton resists the turn to **religious experience** and **value-judgments**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield, born in 1851 in Kentucky and dying in 1921 in New Jersey, is formed in the postbellum American **Presbyterian** context and educated at **Princeton College** and **Princeton Seminary**, then honed by further study in **Leipzig** and **Tübingen** where he encounters German critical scholarship firsthand. He returns to teach first at **Western Theological Seminary** in Allegheny and then occupies the chair of **Didactic and Polemic Theology** at Old **Princeton Seminary** from 1887 until his death, succeeding **Charles Hodge** and **A. A. Hodge** as the chief guardian of Princeton orthodoxy. Theologically, Warfield inhabits a late nineteenth-century world destabilized by **Darwinian evolution**, **historical criticism** of the Bible, and the emergence of **liberal Protestantism**, especially the **Ritschlian** school and the revived **Unitarian** and moral influence views of Christ.

The driving problem for Warfield is how to maintain the full authority of **revelation** and the classical **Reformed** gospel in a context where both Scripture and Christ are being recast in purely moral, experiential, or historical-critical terms. He sees that if the **Bible** is reduced to a fallible record of religious experiences, then the Reformation doctrines of **substitutionary atonement**, **justification by faith**, and **sovereign grace** will be undermined. Thus his life work is to show that **Christianity** can withstand the most rigorous intellectual scrutiny and that the **Reformed confessions** express the system of doctrine actually taught by the inspired Scriptures. Unlike many contemporaries, he refuses the liberal dichotomy between the historical Jesus and the Christ of faith, insisting in his **Christological** essays that the church’s **Chalcedonian** confession is grounded in the New Testament witness.

Warfield also responds to a pastoral crisis arising from the erosion of confidence in the reliability of Scripture among clergy and laity in the **Presbyterian Church**. His detailed exegetical and historical work on **inspiration** aims to reassure the church that the Bible remains a trustworthy foundation for preaching and piety, even as scholarship advances. At the same time, in works like **“Counterfeit Miracles”** and his essays on **evolution**, he navigates the line between defending supernatural **Christianity** and engaging modern knowledge, trying to show that orthodox faith is intellectually credible without capitulating to **modernism**.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Warfield’s method is classically **Reformed** in that he treats **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi, the unique, verbally inspired revelation that norms all theology, yet his way of cashing this out reflects the influence of **Scottish common-sense realism** and a more self-conscious appeal to scientific method. In **“The Idea of Systematic Theology”**, he defines theology as the science that draws its facts from the **Bible**, organizes them by logical processes, and presents them in a coherent system that reflects the mind of God revealed in Scripture. He insists that theology is not poetic construction or religious expression but genuine *scientia*, where the inspired text furnishes the data and reason serves in a ministerial capacity to arrange and deduce. This emphasis on theology as a positive science distinguishes him sharply from **Schleiermacher**, who grounds doctrine in the feeling of absolute dependence, and from **Ritschl**, who reduces dogma to value judgments of the Christian community.

Concerning **revelation**, Warfield consistently defends a robust concept of special revelation as verbal, propositional, and historically embedded, culminating in the inscripturated **Word of God**. In his essays collected in **“The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible”**, he famously articulates and exegetically defends **verbal plenary inspiration**, arguing from texts like **2 Timothy 3:16** and **2 Peter 1:21** that all Scripture is God-breathed, so that the very words of the biblical autographs are the product of the Holy Spirit. He insists that inspiration extends to all parts and kinds of Scripture, not merely to a kerygmatic core, directly opposing the position of **A. Ritschl** and later **liberal** theologians who want a fallible text conveying infallible religious truths. His doctrine of inspiration is tightly correlated with **inerrancy**, understood as the Bible’s freedom from error in all it affirms, when correctly interpreted, because it is the speech of the truthful **God**.

Warfield’s use of **reason** and **experience** reveals his Old Princeton milieu. He strongly affirms the **noetic effects of sin**, following **Augustine** and **Calvin**, yet he also believes that reason as a created faculty retains its basic structures and can serve as a common instrument between believer and unbeliever. Accordingly, his apologetics has a decidedly **evidentialist** flavor: he is confident that historical evidence for the **resurrection**, careful argumentation for the deity of **Christ**, and a reasoned case for the reliability of **Scripture** can commend Christianity to fair-minded people. In contrast to a later **Van Tilian** presuppositionalism, Warfield is more optimistic that unregenerate scholars, if intellectually honest, can see the force of the case for Christian theism, though he still insists that only the Holy Spirit produces saving faith. Experience for Warfield plays a subordinate role: it confirms and enriches what the **Word** teaches but never norms it, so he will sharply oppose **Schleiermacher’s** experiential norm and **Pentecostal** appeals to ongoing miracles as constitutive for theology.

Warfield’s relation to **church** and **history** is more complex. He is deeply committed to the **Westminster Standards** and the broader **Reformed confessions**, repeatedly defending their Augustinian substance in essays on **Calvin** and **Augustine**, yet he refuses to grant any ecclesial body magisterial authority alongside Scripture. The church is a witness and guardian of the Word but never its source. In his historiography, especially in essays like **“Calvin’s Doctrine of the Knowledge of God”**, he traces the victory of **Augustinian grace** in the Reformation and sees Reformed theology as the most consistent form of Christian theism. He reads the history of doctrine largely as a battleground between **Pelagianism** in its many forms and the **sovereign grace** of God in Christ. Here too, he stands closer to **Turretin** and **Hodge** than to more dialectical approaches like those of **Kierkegaard** or **Barth**, who later will criticize the idea of theology as a positive science.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

On **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is that the Bible is the inspired, infallible, and sufficient Word of God, the only rule of faith and practice as articulated in the **Westminster Confession of Faith** chapters 1 and 14. Warfield radicalizes and specifies this baseline in a modern polemical context by arguing not only that Scripture is inspired and infallible but that its inspiration is verbal, plenary, and organically compatible with human authorship. In essays like **“The Biblical Idea of Inspiration”** and **“Inspiration”** for **Hastings’ Dictionary of the Bible** around 1893, later collected in **“The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible”**, he contends against **higher critics** such as **Julius Wellhausen** that the New Testament’s own view of the Old Testament is a fully divine book, so to be Christian is to adopt Christ’s doctrine of Scripture. Warfield’s inerrancy is not a wooden dictation theory; he uses the analogy of **concursus** to explain how divine and human agencies co-operate, echoing **Calvin** and **Turretin**, yet he fortifies this with extensive philological and historical argument to meet **modernist** objections. In this locus he stands as a primary architect of what later becomes the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy**, even though he predates it by decades.

In **Christology**, the confessional norm is the **Chalcedonian Definition** and the Westminster Catechisms: one person in two natures, fully God and fully man, with a real incarnation and a penal substitutionary **atonement**. Warfield’s essays, gathered in **“The Person and Work of Christ”**, take this classical framework and defend it against the moral exemplar and purely human Christologies of **Unitarians**, **Ritschlians**, and other **liberal Protestants**. For example, in his piece **“The Emotional Life of our Lord”** and in his discussions of Christ’s deity and miracles, he underscores both the true humanity and full deity of Jesus, insisting that the Gospels present no mere prophetic religious genius but the incarnate **Son of God** exercising real divine prerogatives. Against **Harnack** and the reduction of Christianity to the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man, Warfield insists that to lose the deity of Christ is to lose **Christianity** itself. His treatment of the atonement maintains a thoroughly **substitutionary** and **satisfaction** model, following **Anselm** and **Calvin**, and he refutes the moral influence theory of **Horace Bushnell** and others by detailed exegesis of Pauline texts.

On **grace, election, and regeneration**, the Reformed confessional baseline is monergistic salvation by sovereign **predestination**, effectual calling, and perseverance, as enshrined in the **Canons of Dort** and the **Westminster Standards**. Warfield consolidates and defends this Augustinian soteriology in essays like **“Augustine and the Pelagian Controversy”**, **“Calvin’s Doctrine of the Knowledge of God”**, and his treatments of **perseverance** and **regeneration**, where he frames the whole doctrinal history of the church as a warfare between **Augustine** and **Pelagius**. He argues that **Calvinism** is simply Christianity come into its own, since only a thoroughgoing doctrine of grace preserves the glory of **God** and the helplessness of the sinner. Against **Arminianism**, **Roman Catholic synergism**, and various forms of **liberal moralism**, he insists that regeneration precedes faith and that perseverance is guaranteed by the immutable decree of God. His interlocutors here include **John Wesley**, **Molina**, and modern **Arminian** and **Holiness** movements that attribute a decisive role to human free will.

On **miracles, providence, and culture**, Reformed orthodoxy affirms that miracles are extraordinary works of **God** that serve to authenticate revelation, while maintaining a comprehensive **providence** over all things. In **“Counterfeit Miracles”**, Warfield defends this baseline by arguing that authentic miracles cluster in the apostolic age as signs of canonical **revelation**, and that post-apostolic miracle claims, particularly in **Roman Catholic** hagiography and contemporary **faith healing** and **Pentecostal** movements, lack credible attestation. He denies that God never answers prayer or acts extraordinarily today, but he rejects the continuation of the **charismata** like tongues and prophecy as ongoing offices, contending against emerging **Pentecostalism** and against Catholic claims of Marian apparitions. In essays on **evolution** and science, he surprisingly allows for the possibility of **theistic evolution** under God’s providence, provided that one maintains the immediate creation of the soul and the historicity of **Adam**, which places him in dialogue with figures like **Charles Hodge** and opponents of Darwin such as **William Jennings Bryan**. Here he tries to demonstrate that commitment to divine **providence** is compatible with certain readings of scientific evidence, though later Reformed theologians will debate whether he grants too much.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Warfield self-consciously presents himself as standing in continuity with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Confession**, and in many respects this is accurate, particularly in his doctrines of **Scripture**, **Christ**, and **grace**. His use of the **concursus** model for inspiration and his insistence on the organic, not mechanical, character of inspiration echo earlier Reformed scholastics like **Turretin** and **Voetius**. His Augustinian reading of salvation history and his praise of **Augustine** and **Calvin** as the great doctors of grace align with **Bavinck’s** judgments in the **Reformed Dogmatics**, and his high view of the confessions anticipates **Vos’s** insistence on the unity of biblical and systematic theology. Yet already in **Vos’s** own work and especially in **Van Til**, there is a sense that Old Princeton, while doctrinally sound, was not fully self-critical about its reliance on **Scottish common-sense realism** and a shared autonomous rationality.

A Westminster examiner will almost certainly press on two points of objection. First, Warfield’s **apologetic method** is often read, not without basis, as granting too much to neutral reason and not fully honoring the antithesis that **Van Til** draws between belief and unbelief. Warfield’s confidence that the unregenerate mind can weigh the evidences impartially seems difficult to square with **Romans 1** and **Ephesians 4** as Van Til reads them, where all reasoning is either covenantally obedient or apostate. Second, Warfield’s openness to certain forms of **theistic evolution** and his relative silence on issues like the length of the creation days can create tension with some contemporary conservative Reformed commitments to a stricter reading of **Genesis 1–2**, especially in circles influenced by **Machen** and later **creationist** movements. Neither of these concerns undermines his core orthodoxy, but they mark areas where a Westminster candidate should qualify his legacy.

At the same time, there are clear places where Reformed theologians must learn from Warfield. His relentless defense of **inspiration and inerrancy**, closely tied to the **person of Christ**, offers a model for how to anchor bibliology in Christology, since he repeatedly argues that to deny the Bible’s claims is to pit oneself against Christ’s own doctrine of Scripture. His careful exegesis, broad learning in **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformation** sources, and irenic yet firm tone in controversy provide a paradigm for scholarly **polemic** that neither retreats into fideism nor capitulates to **modernism**. Later Reformed theologians, including **Machen** and **Carl F. H. Henry**, draw heavily on Warfield in their battles against **liberalism**, and even **Van Til**, while critiquing Warfield’s epistemology, respects his confessional commitments. Thus, while Old Princeton’s method receives correction in the Westminster tradition, its doctrinal substance, with Warfield as chief exponent, remains a vital resource.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, a safe opening line is to say that **B. B. Warfield** is the culminating theologian of **Old Princeton**, whose lasting contributions lie especially in his doctrine of **Scripture** and his defense of classic **Christology** and **Augustinian** grace in the face of rising liberalism and higher criticism. It is also safe to state, almost verbatim, that for Warfield theology is a **science** of God that takes the inspired Scriptures as its divinely given facts and seeks to systematize them for the church’s faith and life. You can confidently describe his view of **inspiration** as verbal, plenary, and organic, and his doctrine of **inerrancy** as an implication of God’s truthfulness, not a foreign imposition on the text. Examiners will appreciate clear references to key works like **“The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible”**, **“The Person and Work of Christ”**, and **“Counterfeit Miracles”**, and to his Augustinian framing of doctrinal history as the conflict between **grace** and **Pelagianism**.

However, there are phrases and emphases that you must either avoid or carefully qualify. You should avoid calling Warfield a **presuppositionalist** or suggesting that he anticipates **Van Til** wholesale; instead, say that he is broadly **Reformed** yet still shaped by **common-sense realism** and an evidential cast in apologetics. Do not describe his method as relying on a neutral *analogia entis*, since that suggests a Thomistic natural theology foreign to his own commitments; instead speak of his confidence in reason as an instrument subordinate to **revelation** but still shared between believer and unbeliever at the level of logical laws. Be cautious in how you speak about his stance on **evolution**: acknowledge that he entertained **theistic evolution** within a strong doctrine of providence and historic **Adam**, but do not imply that he endorsed a full-blown Darwinian naturalism. Avoid phrases like **biblicism** to describe his view of Scripture, since he is deeply confessional and historically informed, not a bare proof-texter.

Examiners sometimes exploit misunderstandings about Warfield coming from two sides. On one side, students influenced by modern evangelical debates may caricature Warfield as the inventor of **inerrancy** or as reducing the Bible to a stack of propositions divorced from redemptive history, which ignores his careful appeal to **concursus** and his robust **Christocentric** focus. You should correct this by noting that his inspiration doctrine is a development of earlier **Reformed scholastics** like **Turretin**, not a novelty, and that he situates Scripture within God’s saving economy. On the other side, some portray him as simply a rationalist or proto-fundamentalist, which fails to appreciate his deep **Augustinian** and **Calvinistic** commitments and his nuanced scholarship. Examiners will approve if you recognize his limitations, especially when you bring in **Van Til** to critique his evidentialism, yet still affirm him as a key ally against **liberalism**. When pressed, say that Westminster’s critique of Old Princeton is one of epistemological calibration, not doctrinal repudiation.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Warfield should be embraced as a remarkably faithful **Reformed** theologian whose teaching on **Scripture**, **Christ**, and **grace** stands squarely within the **Westminster Confession** and provides essential resources for resisting **liberal** and **neo-orthodox** erosions of biblical authority and the gospel, yet his epistemology and apologetic method must be corrected by a more thoroughgoing recognition of the *antithesis* and the necessity of **presuppositional** commitment as articulated by **Van Til**. We affirm his doctrines of verbal plenary **inspiration**, inerrancy, and substitutionary atonement, and his Augustinian monergism; we deny that reason can in practice operate in a neutral sphere or that evidences by themselves can yield saving knowledge of God, and we insist on the primacy of the self-attesting **Word** and the internal testimony of the **Spirit**. If asked where we land, we say: with Warfield in his confessional **orthodoxy**, gratefully using his exegesis and polemics against **modernism**, yet beyond Warfield in pressing the claim that every fact and every thought is already covenantally interpreted and that all sound theology must begin, not end, with the absolute authority of the triune **God** speaking in Scripture.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **B. B. Warfield** is the culminating voice of **Old Princeton**, whose robust defense of **inspiration**, **Christology**, and **Augustinian grace** anchors Reformed orthodoxy in the face of modernism.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- From 1851 in Kentucky to 1921 at **Princeton Seminary**, Warfield lives through the rise of **higher criticism** and **liberal Protestantism** in America and Europe.
- His core bibliological essays, later collected as **“The Inspiration and Authority of the Bible” (1948)**, are written mainly between the 1880s and 1915 against **higher critics**.
- Key doctrinal works include **“The Person and Work of Christ” (1908)** on **Christology**, **“Counterfeit Miracles” (1918)** on **miracles**, and **“Calvin and Augustine” (1905)** on **grace** and **election**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Warfield defines theology as a **science** that takes its facts from **revelation** in Scripture and organizes them by sanctified **reason**.
- He practices a largely **evidentialist** apologetic, convinced that historical and rational evidence for **Christ** and **Scripture** can commend the faith to fair-minded unbelievers.
- While upholding the **noetic effects of sin**, he assumes a shared rational structure with unbelievers, reflecting **Scottish common-sense realism** more than **Van Tilian** antithesis.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **Scripture**, Warfield articulates a precise doctrine of **verbal plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy**, grounding it in the self-witness of the Bible and the doctrine of **God**.
- On **Christology**, he defends the full **deity** and humanity of Christ and a penal **substitutionary atonement** against **Ritschlian** and **liberal** reductions.
- On **grace and election**, he champions **Augustinian** and **Calvinist** monergism, depicting doctrinal history as the struggle between **Augustine** and **Pelagius**.
- On **miracles**, he argues in **“Counterfeit Miracles”** that biblical **miracles** functioned as revelatory signs tied to the apostolic age, opposing **Roman Catholic** and **Pentecostal** continuationism.
- On **providence and culture**, he allows a carefully qualified **theistic evolution**, insisting on divine sovereignty and the historicity of **Adam**, engaging modern science without capitulation.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press whether Warfield’s **evidentialism** compromises a fully **presuppositional** account of knowledge and the antithesis of **Romans 1**.
- There will be questions about whether his reliance on **common-sense realism** is fully consistent with **Calvin’s** and **Van Til’s** emphasis on the *sensus divinitatis* and the Spirit’s testimony.
- His openness to forms of **theistic evolution** will be probed in relation to Reformed commitments about **creation**, **Adam**, and the fall.
- Some will query whether his strong focus on **propositional revelation** leaves enough room for **redemptive-historical** categories later emphasized by **Vos** and Westminster.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Warfield vs Schleiermacher** on the norm of theology, with Warfield rooting doctrine in **inspired Scripture** and Schleiermacher in **religious experience**.
- **Warfield vs Ritschl** on **Christ** and the kingdom, with Warfield defending the **deity of Christ** against Ritschl’s ethical reduction.
- **Warfield vs Van Til** on apologetics, contrasting **evidentialist** use of reason with **presuppositional** emphasis on antithesis and the self-attesting **Word**.
- **Warfield vs Bavinck** on Scripture and modernity, both affirming **inspiration** and **inerrancy** yet differing in their assessments of **philosophical** method and culture.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Warfield is a central ally for Westminster in defending **Scripture**, **Christ**, and **grace**, yet his Old Princeton **evidentialism** must be chastened by a more radical **presuppositional** epistemology that begins and ends with the self-attesting triune **God** of Scripture.
