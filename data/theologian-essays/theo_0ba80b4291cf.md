### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Context, and Method
Christopher J. H. Wright emerges from **Irish Anglican evangelicalism** in the late twentieth century and becomes a leading figure in the global **Lausanne Movement**. Born in **Belfast in 1947** and educated at **Cambridge**, he trained in classics and theology before doctoral work in Old Testament, focusing on **Deuteronomy** and the social economy of Israel. Ordained in the **Church of England**, Wright served in parish ministry and then taught in **India at Union Biblical Seminary, Pune**, during the 1980s, grounding his scholarship in cross-cultural and Majority World realities. His later leadership as **Principal of All Nations Christian College** in the 1990s and then as **International Director of Langham Partnership** from 2001 symbolizes a vocation that straddles **biblical scholarship**, **mission strategy**, and **pastoral formation**, always in conversation with **John Stott’s** evangelical catholicity and global concern.

Wright’s method is a disciplined **missional hermeneutic** that reads the entire canon as a coherent **narrative of God’s mission**. From **Genesis to Revelation** the Bible tells the story of **YHWH**, the creator and redeemer, who shapes a people to mediate blessing to **the nations**. This approach is not an add-on to exegesis but a formal stance: **mission is hermeneutically determinative**. In this frame, **missio Dei** names the divine initiative that precedes and grounds ecclesial activity. Wright argues that **Scripture’s authority** is received as the formative narrative of a community called into **holistic obedience**. He therefore combines **historical exegesis**, **canonical synthesis**, and **ethical reflection**, drawing on *heilsgeschichte* and emphasizing the **Abrahamic promise** as a structural spine for the canon’s unity.

The historical setting for Wright’s intellectual development includes the shift from mission as Western export to mission as **polycentric and global**, a change captured by **Lausanne 1974** and consolidated in **Cape Town 2010**. He converses with **Lesslie Newbigin** on gospel and culture and with **David Bosch** on paradigms of mission, while sustaining rigorous dialogue with **OT ethical scholarship** from **Gerhard von Rad** to **Gordon Wenham**. His method foregrounds **covenant**, **idolatry**, and **wisdom**, insisting that biblical ethics are not an antiquarian code but **theological realities** that press the church toward truthful witness in public life.

#### 2. Old Testament Ethics: Paradigms, Values, and the People of God
Wright’s early and programmatic work **Living as the People of God** 1983, substantially revised as **Old Testament Ethics for the People of God** 2004, countered the modern fiction that the **Old Testament** is ethically obsolete. The burden of the argument is that Israel’s Scriptures disclose **the character of God**, the **shape of redeemed community**, and **patterns of social life** that endure as moral instruction for the **people of God** across the covenants. Wright articulates a model of **paradigmatic application**: concrete laws in **Torah** function as normative case studies that disclose **transcendent values** rooted in the **holiness and justice of YHWH**. He rejects simplistic proof-texting and also resists historicist reduction, proposing instead a disciplined movement from **text to paradigm to principle to application**.

A hallmark of his ethics is the **ethical triangle** of **God, Israel, and the land**, through which Israel’s moral life is seen as simultaneously theological, social, and ecological. Key topics include **Jubilee and land tenure** in Leviticus 25, **Sabbath economics**, protection of the poor and the resident foreigner, and the critique of **idolatry** as the deep structure of social injustice. Wright’s essays on **family, property, and judicial procedure** frame the law as guardianship of communal shalom rather than mere sanction. Central is **imitatio Dei**: Israel is to be holy because God is holy, walking in the **ways of the Lord**. He maintains that this ethical grammar remains binding on the church as **wisdom fulfilled in Christ**, not as a return to the Mosaic covenant but as **eschatologically transposed obedience** in the **Spirit**.

#### 3. The Mission of God: Canon, Covenant, and the Nations
Wright’s magnum opus **The Mission of God** 2006 offers a comprehensive **biblical theology of mission** that makes **missio Dei** the organizing principle of the canon. He argues that the **Abrahamic covenant** in **Genesis 12** supplies the missional telos of election: chosen for the sake of **blessing the nations**. The narrative through **Exodus**, **Sinai**, **land**, and **kingship**, into **exile and restoration**, is read as the drama of God’s relentless commitment to **creational redemption** and **covenantal fidelity**. Prophetic literature is framed as both judgment upon **idolatry** and an eschatological vision of **international worship**, with texts like **Isaiah 2** and **Micah 4** imagining nations streaming to the knowledge of God.

Within this frame Wright situates **Christology** and **ecclesiology**. Jesus fulfills Israel’s identity and mission, and the **church** participates in that mission through **witness, worship, and work** empowered by the **Spirit**. The **Great Commission** in **Matthew 28** and the **Acts 1** horizon of Judea, Samaria, and the ends of the earth are placed within the long trajectory of **covenant and promise**, not as a novelty but as the climactic expansion of God’s purposes. The category of **holistic mission** is crucial: evangelism, **justice**, **compassion**, and **creation care** together manifest the reign of God. Wright is explicit that **God is the primary missionary**; the church participates, embodying the gospel narratively and ethically.

#### 4. The Mission of God’s People and Lausanne’s Integral Vision
In **The Mission of God’s People** 2010, Wright translates his dense biblical theology into a pastorally oriented agenda for congregations. He articulates comprehensive vocation: the church **worships God**, **bears witness**, **builds community**, **seeks justice**, **shows compassion**, **cares for creation**, **engages in work and public life**, and **prays**. Each sphere is grounded in the canon’s story, weaving **Psalms, Prophets, Gospels, and Epistles** into a single summons. The book emphasizes that mission is not a department but the **identity of the people of God**, an ecclesial habitus shaped by **Scripture** and animated by the **Spirit**.

Wright’s leadership in **Lausanne** culminates at **Cape Town 2010**, where he chaired theological work and contributed significantly to **The Cape Town Commitment**. That text embodies **integral mission**, balancing **evangelistic proclamation** with **social ethics** grounded in **biblical authority**. Wright brings to Lausanne a robust defense of **Scripture’s unity**, a repentant critique of **idolatries** within the church such as power and greed, and a global perspective that prioritizes **Majority World voices**. The result is a catholic evangelical consensus that resists both privatized piety and politicized reduction, staking the church’s life on **public truth** under the **lordship of Christ**.

#### 5. Idolatry, Economics, and Creation Care
A distinctive strand in Wright’s theology is the sustained analysis of **idolatry** as the fountainhead of social and political disorder. Drawing from **Deuteronomy**, **Isaiah**, and **Romans 1**, he frames idolatry as the exchange of the **Creator’s glory** for creaturely surrogates, birthing violence, exploitation, and ecological vandalism. His treatment of **economic justice** returns repeatedly to **Jubilee**, **Sabbath**, and land ethics as divine correctives to accumulative greed. Wright does not claim that Israel’s land laws are directly transplantable; rather, they embody **creational and covenantal values** that constrain concentrations of wealth, protect **the poor**, and honor **the earth** as the Lord’s.

From this ethic flows a robust plea for **creation care** as integral to **mission**. Genesis 1–2, the **Noahic covenant**, and Psalms 24 and 104 are marshaled to argue that the **gospel of the kingdom** includes the redemption of **all creation**. Wright resists dualisms that collapse salvation into soul-flight and instead advances a **new creation eschatology** that energizes prudent stewardship, scientific endeavor, and public advocacy. The doctrine of **resurrection and renewal** frames ecology not as an alternative gospel but as a dimension of **discipleship** and **witness** to the **lordship of the risen Christ**.

#### 6. Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament and Canonical Christology
In **Knowing Jesus Through the Old Testament** 1992, revised 2014, Wright interweaves **biblical theology** and **Christology**, arguing that **Jesus** cannot be rightly known apart from **Israel’s Scriptures**. He develops models of **typology** and **promise-fulfillment** that present Jesus as the embodiment of **Torah**, **Wisdom**, **Prophet**, **Priest**, and **King**, and as the representative **Israel** who accomplishes the divine mission. The **Sermon on the Mount**, **parables**, and **Passion** are read as steeped in **Deuteronomy** and **Psalms**, while the **Great Commission** is treated as an Abrahamic expansion to **the nations**. Wright underscores the **unity of Scripture** as a hermeneutical axiom for evangelical theology.

This canonical Christology feeds back into ethics and mission. The **Spirit’s gift** of renewal, explored in volumes like **Knowing the Holy Spirit Through the Old Testament**, means that **new covenant** obedience is not antinomian but Spirit-empowered **imitatio Christi**. Wright insists that the church’s holiness is public and embodied in **truthful speech**, **merciful practice**, and **justice-seeking**. His approach counters **Marcionite** tendencies and resists reduction of the gospel to minimal propositions, while holding to **evangelical convictions** about the **authority of Scripture** and the necessity of **conversion and faith**.

#### 7. Theodicy, Holy War, and Difficult Texts
Wright’s **The God I Do Not Understand** 2008 addresses **evil**, **suffering**, **the Canaanite conquest**, and **hell** with pastoral candor and scholarly care. He argues that the **herem** texts must be read within Israel’s unique **redemptive-historical** moment, as acts of divine **judgment** against a culture saturated with violence and idolatry, and as exceptional rather than normative. He warns that any attempt to transpose **holy war** into contemporary politics is a betrayal of **the cross** and the noncoercive character of **gospel mission**. On **evil and suffering**, Wright integrates **lament** in the **Psalms** with the **apocalyptic hope** of **resurrection**, insisting that only **Easter** provides eschatological resolution.

This work exhibits his broader hermeneutic: difficult texts are neither sanitized nor discarded but located within the **canonical narrative** of **creation, fall, redemption, and new creation**. The church is called to intellectual honesty, moral humility, and **eschatological patience**, confessing what is revealed and acknowledging what remains hidden. Wright thus models an **evangelical theodicy** that neither collapses into **skepticism** nor lapses into glib **theological triumphalism**.

#### 8. Scholarship, Ministry, and Global Formation
Beyond monographs, Wright’s commentaries such as **Deuteronomy** in the NIBC series 1996 and **Haggai, Zechariah and Malachi** in TOTC 2004 exhibit his philological competence and pastoral clarity. As **Langham Partnership** director and later **Global Ambassador**, he championed **expository preaching**, **contextual theology**, and **capacity building** for Majority World scholars. His editorial and advisory roles within **Lausanne** nurtured a global theological conversation marked by **evangelical catholicity** and attentiveness to **cultural pluralism**. He consciously positions himself amid debates over **liberation theology**, **postcolonial hermeneutics**, and **Western secularism**, advocating a path that is **missionally public** and **scripturally tethered**.

Interlocutors are formative. From **John Stott**, Wright inherits a high view of **biblical authority** and a commitment to **integral mission**. From **Lesslie Newbigin**, he receives a vision of **public truth**. From **David Bosch**, he absorbs the complexity of mission paradigms. In OT studies he dialogues with **von Rad’s** tradition-history, **Wenham’s** conservative exegesis, and **Brueggemann’s** rhetorical imagination, forging a synthesis that is canonically robust and ecclesially directed. Wright’s scholarly ministry exhibits confidence that **biblical theology** can sustain a global church in the age of **pluralism** and **post-Christendom**.

#### 9. Systematic Bearings and Doctrinal Texture
While not a systematician, Wright’s corpus develops a coherent doctrinal texture. **Bibliology** is high and ecclesial, with **Scripture** functioning as the formative narrative under which the church sits in **obedience**. **Theology proper** is implicitly Trinitarian, with **Father, Son, and Spirit** identified by their unified **mission**. **Anthropology** affirms the dignity of the **image of God** and names **idolatry** as the root of moral disintegration. **Soteriology** is narratively framed as **exodus**, **exile and return**, and **new covenant**, finding fulfillment in **Christ’s atoning death and resurrection**. **Ecclesiology** is participatory and vocational, emphasizing the **people of God** as a priestly community for the **nations**. **Eschatology** is new-creation oriented, providing teleological energy for **holistic mission** and **ethical perseverance**.

At multiple points Wright clarifies that mission is God’s initiative and that the church’s calling includes **evangelistic proclamation** as central. Yet this proclamation is embodied, pressing toward **justice**, **compassion**, and **stewardship** as signs of the **kingdom**. The doctrine of **sin** in its personal and structural dimensions anchors his social critique, while **grace** empowers concrete obedience. The cumulative effect is a **biblical-theological spirituality** that calls churches to become plausibility structures for the **gospel** in late modern societies and in the global South.

#### 10. Reception and Reformed Evaluation
Reformed readers have welcomed Wright’s **covenantal reading** of Scripture, his insistence on **biblical authority**, and his defense of **canonical unity** centered on **the Abrahamic promise**. His use of **biblical theology** resonates with classic Reformed attention to **covenant of grace**, **Christ as mediator**, and the church as **pilgrim people** on the way to **new creation**. His critique of **idolatry**, emphasis on **public truth**, and zeal for **expository preaching** through **Langham Partnership** align well with the **Word-centered** commitments of Reformed orthodoxy.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation will nevertheless register tensions. First, in privileging **missio Dei** as hermeneutical center, Wright can appear to subordinate **justification by faith** and **union with Christ** to a broader social telos, risking a dilution of the **law and gospel** distinction that guards the gratuity of grace. Second, his **integral mission** can be read as advancing a **transformationalist** expectation that leans toward a single-kingdom vision, while classic **two-kingdoms** or **sphere-sovereignty** accounts would distinguish the church’s institutional mandate in **Word and sacrament** from Christians’ diverse vocations in common grace. Third, Wright’s **paradigmatic use of Torah** yields rich ethical wisdom yet could blur the **covenantal discontinuities** that preserve the church from sacralizing **theocracy** or collapsing **Israel-church** distinctions. Fourth, while his treatment of **creation care** is theologically serious, Reformed critiques may urge clarification that such stewardship, though good and commanded, is ordinarily outworked through Christians’ callings in civil society rather than through the church as church. Finally, the appropriation of **holy war** texts as exceptional is salutary, yet a stronger account of **redemption-accomplished and applied**, with **ordinary means of grace** at the center, would better secure the primacy of **preaching, sacraments, and prayer** as the specific mission of the church. The Reformed alternative sustains Wright’s canonical breadth and public seriousness while re-centering **Christ’s finished work**, **effectual calling**, and the **pilgrim polity** of the church within the covenantal economy of **revelation and grace**.
