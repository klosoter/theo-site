### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Samuel Rutherford, born 1600 in Roxburghshire, matured amid the late **Reformation**’s Scottish consolidation and the rising convulsions of Stuart **royal absolutism**, becoming a defining voice of **Covenanter** constitutionalism and **presbyterian jure divino**. Educated at **Edinburgh** and ordained to **Anwoth** in 1627, he was deprived by episcopal authority in 1636 and confined in **Aberdeen**, where the celebrated **Letters** were composed, expressing a theology of **communion with Christ** that unites scholastic precision with spiritual ardor. Restored by the **1638 National Covenant**, Rutherford became professor of divinity at **St Andrews** in 1639 and a commissioner to the **Westminster Assembly** in 1643. His method combines **Scripture sufficiency and the regulative principle** with **Reformed scholastic** tools, deploying distinctions of **causes, habitus and actus**, and careful uses of **analogia fidei**. Influenced by **John Knox** and **Andrew Melville** in ecclesiology, by **William Ames** in casuistry and piety, and by classical **Reformed orthodoxy** in doctrine, Rutherford’s hallmark is a covenantal integration of **law, gospel, and polity** under the **mediatorial kingship of Christ**.

Rutherford’s intellectual posture is not biblicism but a disciplined **scriptural rationality** that orders **natural law** within a federal schema. For him, natural law supplies common moral axioms, yet it is covenantally specified under the **foedus operum** and redeemed under the **foedus gratiae**, thus guarding **grace** from collapse into **nature** and ensuring the **divine law’s supremacy** over magistrates and ministers. His prose ranges from scholastic Latin technicalities to the searing experiential idiom of **Puritan piety**, but the through line remains the **lordship of Christ** articulated in canonical terms and deployed in church order, civil resistance, and spiritual counsel.

#### 2. Westminster Assembly and presbyterian jure divino
At the **Westminster Assembly** 1643–1647 Rutherford labored with **George Gillespie**, **Robert Baillie**, and **David Dickson** to secure **presbyterian polity** as not merely expedient but **jure divino**, grounding the **power of the keys** in Christ’s institution and the parity of **presbyters**. In **The Due Right of Presbyteries** 1644 and **The Divine Right of Church Government and Excommunication** 1646 he argued that **Matthew 16 and 18** and **Acts 15** disclose a visible, graded structure of **sessions, presbyteries, and synods**, possessing a spiritual **jurisdiction** distinct from the civil sword. Against **Independents** such as **Thomas Goodwin** and **Philip Nye**, he contended that congregational autonomy dissolves catholic unity and undermines **discipline**, while **Erastianism** subjects **Christ’s kingdom** to Caesar. Rutherford’s crucial distinction between the magistrate’s **power circa sacra** and not **in sacris** defends civil guardianship around religion without invading sacramental and ministerial acts, a distinction that secures **church freedom** while maintaining a theocratic order of public life under the **first and second tables of the law**.

These ecclesiological positions informed chapters 30 and 31 of the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, on **church censures** and **synods**, where the Assembly delineated spiritual authority and ministerial power. Rutherford’s citations of **patristic polity**, appeals to **antiquity** without capitulation to tradition, and exacting exegesis under the **regulative principle** yield a coherent picture: the ascended Christ exercises **mediatorial kingship** over church and nations, but the instruments of that rule differ in **form and end**. The **keys** bind and loose by Word and discipline, while the magistrate bears the **sword** to protect true religion and civil peace.

#### 3. Lex, Rex and covenantal constitutionalism
Rutherford’s most famous political work, **Lex, Rex** 1644, crystallizes a **covenantal constitutionalism** that rejects **divine-right absolutism** by declaring that law makes the king, not the king the law. Drawing on **George Buchanan** and medieval conciliarist streams received through **Reformed natural law**, Rutherford argues that sovereignty is by **divine ordinance** vested in the people, who, through covenant and consent, entrust it to the ruler under **fundamental law**. This produces a limited monarchy answerable to **God’s moral law**, the **mediatorial rule of Christ**, and established **constitutions**. He articulates a robust doctrine of **lesser magistrates** and qualified popular resistance, insisting that disobedience to tyrannical commands is not sedition but obedience to **Lex Dei**. The architecture is scholastically tight: from **first principles of natural law** to concrete cases, with careful use of **case divinity** to handle conscientious resistance and oath-bound obligations.

In polemics against **royalist** apologists like **John Maxwell** and in anticipation of **Thomas Hobbes’s Leviathan** 1651, Rutherford rejects the identification of peace with absolute power and instead binds peace to **justice under law**. He contends that the magistrate is a **fideicommissary** of the people’s trust, not a proprietor of subjects. The **National Covenant** 1638 and **Solemn League and Covenant** 1643 exemplify corporate obligation under **Christ’s supremacy**, making covenant a public constitutional category rather than a mere spiritual trope. The **Restoration** in 1660 ordered **Lex, Rex** burned and summoned Rutherford for treason; he died in 1661 before trial, a witness to the cost of his **covenantal polity**.

#### 4. Liberty of conscience and the bounds of toleration
Rutherford’s **A Free Disputation against Pretended Liberty of Conscience** 1649 is a controversial landmark in **Reformed establishmentarianism**. He fiercely denies that liberty of conscience entails liberty for **heresy, blasphemy, or idolatry**, arguing that the magistrate as **custos utriusque tabulae** must uphold both tables of the **Decalogue**. Against **John Goodwin**, **Baptist separatists**, and **Socinians**, he distinguishes true **liberty of conscience before God** from an unbounded **libertas indifferentiae**. The magistrate’s care is **circa sacra** and not **in sacris**; thus he may not preach, administer sacraments, or usurp church censures, but he must restrain public seduction to apostasy and punish civilly harmful doctrines. Rutherford’s casuistry turns on **adiaphora**, **scandal**, and the public nature of doctrinal confession, seeking to prevent a slide from plural toleration to nihilistic indifference.

His reasoning fuses **natural law** common goods with **covenantal** specification, claiming that the commonwealth has a teleology beyond mere order: it is ordered to the acknowledged **worship of the true God**. Critics charge that this collapses ecclesial into civil ends, but Rutherford’s use of **circa sacra/in sacris** aims to maintain a duality of jurisdictions while refusing religious neutrality. The result is a principled, if severe, blueprint for **confessional uniformity** that fits seventeenth-century **Reformed orthodoxy** and the vision of national **covenanting**.

#### 5. Federal soteriology and the offer of the gospel
Beyond polity and politics, Rutherford is a substantive voice in **federal soteriology**. In **Christ Dying and Drawing Sinners to Himself** 1647 and **The Covenant of Life Opened** 1655 he expounds the twofold covenant, **foedus operum** with Adam and **foedus gratiae** in Christ, uniting **imputation** and **union with Christ**. He teaches the **imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience**, insists that **faith** is the **instrumental cause** of justification, and secures assurance through the **promissory word** rather than introspective achievement. His **Trial and Triumph of Faith** 1645, a meditation on the Syrophoenician woman, blends doctrinal grammar with pastoral **experimental divinity**, guiding the soul through **desertion**, **temptation**, and **perseverance** toward the **beatific hope**.

Rutherford’s polemics against **Antinomianism** answer **Tobias Crisp** and **John Saltmarsh** with a robust **third use of the law**, defending that the justified are bound to **evangelical obedience** without lapsing into **legalism**. He wields scholastic distinctions of **actus elicitus** and **actus imperatus** to clarify the moral acts of the renewed will and guards the **gratuitousness of grace** against all causal confusion. His sacramental theology aligns with the **Westminster Standards**, advocating **paedobaptism** by covenantal inclusion, a spiritual **real presence** in the Supper, and the **regulative principle** in worship as the conscientious form of **sola Scriptura**.

#### 6. Providence, decree, and freedom
As a **Reformed orthodox** divine, Rutherford affirms comprehensive **divine providence** grounded in the eternal **decree**, rejecting **middle knowledge** and any synergism that would compromise **sovereign grace**. He reads **Romans 9** and **Acts 2:23** to hold together divine concurrence and human culpability, articulating a compatibilist account of **liberty** as rational spontaneity under ordered causes. The careful scholastic deployment of **primary and secondary causality** preserves the immediacy of **God’s concursus** without erasing creaturely operations. Though he never produced a full **systematic theology** in the later Turretinian mold, his scattered loci display adherence to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, doctrines shared across **post-Reformation** confessional boundaries and mediated through the **Amesian** and broader Protestant scholastic synthesis.

Rutherford’s doctrines of **providence** and **evil** aim at pastoral stability: the same God who determines ends ordains means, especially **prayer**, **preaching**, and **sacrament**. This allows him to hold the line between **fatalism** and Pelagian moralism, both of which he treats as threats to evangelical **assurance**. The metaphysical backbone of his political and ecclesial convictions is thus a high doctrine of God, such that **law and covenant** are not arbitrary human constructs but historical refractions of **God’s eternal wisdom**.

#### 7. Church and magistrate: spheres, oaths, and discipline
Rutherford’s practical ecclesiology turns on **discipline**, **oaths**, and the integrity of **synods**, all situated under **Christ’s kingship**. He treats **covenants** and **national oaths** as morally binding instruments that knit persons and polities into ordered fidelity before God. The magistrate’s **circa sacra** stewardship obliges him to defend councils and assemblies from disorder, while **presbyteries** exercise **excommunication** and admission to the **Lord’s Table** according to **jure divino** norms. Here Rutherford is most rigorously opposed to **Erastianism**, since to collapse ecclesiastical censure into civil penalty would dethrone **Christ the King** from his spiritual kingdom. Yet he is equally opposed to **Independency**, which he sees as reducing catholic unity to a mosaic of local voluntarism.

The casuistry of **scandal** and **adiaphora** anchors his regulation of public worship under the **regulative principle**, where only what God commands is lawful in his church. He permits **civil discretion** in circumstances common to human actions and societies, but he bans innovations in **sacred elements** and **forms**. The result is a consistent architecture: covenantal oaths bind peoples, **law** binds kings, and **discipline** binds consciences as God speaks by his **Word** through ordained means.

#### 8. Experiential piety and the Letters
The devotional **Letters** published posthumously in 1664 furnish the beating heart of Rutherford’s theology, revealing how **federal grace** becomes experiential **communion with Christ**. From exile in **Aberdeen** to the turmoil of the **Covenanting** years, Rutherford writes of **assurance**, **mortification**, **joy under the cross**, and the radiance of **Christ’s beauty**. The Letters traffic in metaphors of **marriage covenant**, **pilgrimage**, and **inheritance**, employing the same covenantal idiom that structures **Lex, Rex** but transposed to the soul’s pilgrimage. Far from a split between public doctrine and private devotion, Rutherford’s spirituality is the inward face of his **covenantal** and **christocratic** system: the same **mediatorial kingship** that orders parliaments also orders affections, setting the conscience free from men that it might be bound to **God alone**.

This spiritual grammar preserves the **Reformed** balance of indicatives and imperatives. Consolations are grounded in **election**, **union with Christ**, and the **promises**, not in subjective temperature; imperatives follow as **evangelical obedience** under the Spirit’s **sanctifying** work. Here Rutherford exhibits the pastoral genius of **Puritan experimental divinity**: rigorous in doctrine, tender in application, and always keyed to the **means of grace**. He died in 1661, ejected at the **Restoration**, yet the Letters kept his witness alive long after **Lex, Rex** was consigned to public flames.

#### 9. Legacy and a Reformed/WTS evaluation
Rutherford’s legacy spans **confessional theology**, **constitutional theory**, and **devotional literature**, making him a rare integrator in the **Puritan** constellation. His contribution to the **Westminster Standards** set enduring trajectories for **presbyterian polity** and **discipline**, while **Lex, Rex** remains a cornerstone of **Reformed resistance theory** and **rule-of-law constitutionalism**. His **federal soteriology** guarded Reformed commitments to **imputation**, **assurance**, and the **third use of the law**, and his **Letters** continue to tutor Christian affection under **Christ’s lordship**. From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, Rutherford’s epistemic stance under **sola Scriptura**, his deployment of **covenant theology**, and his high doctrine of **God’s decree and providence** are exemplars of classical orthodoxy. Tensions arise in his **establishmentarian** program and denial of wide **religious liberty**, where his **circa sacra/in sacris** distinction seeks to prevent Erastianism but still empowers coercive uniformity. Later Reformed developments, appealing to principled **two-kingdoms** distinctions and **sphere sovereignty**, or to a thicker account of **general revelation** and **prudential natural law** in plural polities, might reassign the magistrate’s ends to temporal justice without requiring confessional enforcement, while preserving **church freedom** and the **regulative principle**. On political resistance, Rutherford’s **popular sovereignty under God** offers a durable alternative to **Hobbesian** statism; on conscience, a WTS-leaning approach would press harder the evangelical grammar of **Word and Spirit**, securing robust liberty in matters indifferent and refusing civil compulsion of belief. The net assessment is strongly positive on **revelation and covenant**, appreciative yet qualified on **nature and civil order**, and deeply indebted to Rutherford’s integration of **law, gospel, and kingship** under the ascended Christ.
