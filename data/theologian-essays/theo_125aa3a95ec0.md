### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
James Wetzel is a contemporary American philosopher of religion whose abiding subject is **Augustine**, interpreted within the late twentieth-century resurgence of **virtue ethics** and the post-secular rehabilitation of **theological sources** in moral philosophy. Working in the ecosystem of Villanova’s Augustinian tradition and the broader movement of **philosophical theology**, Wetzel situates Augustine in conversation with **Aristotle**, **MacIntyre**, and **Taylor**, while refusing to reduce Augustine to a supplier of **classical eudaimonism**. His project emerges amid debates over **reason and tradition**, the legacy of **secularization**, and the retrieval of **patristic moral psychology** as a counter to modern voluntarism and rationalism. Methodologically he advances a confessional-phenomenological reading of Augustine that privileges **interiority**, the **divided will**, and the spiritual disciplines of **humility** and **confession**, deploying the Augustinian insight that knowledge without **caritas** degenerates into **libido sciendi**. The result is philosophical theology that is wary of **systematic mastery** and attentive to the corrective force of **grace** in the formation of agency.

Wetzel’s procedure is anchored in close reading of **Confessions**, **De libero arbitrio**, **De Trinitate**, and **The City of God**, but always with an eye to contemporary concerns in **moral psychology** and **political theology**. He maintains that the Augustinian account of **concupiscence** and **original sin** is not a speculative archaism but a diagnostic lens for modern projects of self-fashioning. Against narratives that cast Augustine as a proto-**Stoic** or a domesticated Christian **Aristotelian**, he frames Augustine as a critic of ethical self-sufficiency, whose insistence on **gratia preveniens** and **caritas** exposes the fragility of virtue and the unavailability of moral mastery. These commitments position Wetzel within the ongoing quarrel between **virtue ethics** and **grace-centered soteriology**, and between **political liberalism** and **Augustinian realism** about the **saeculum**.

#### 2. Augustine and the Limits of Virtue 1992
Wetzel’s first major statement, **Augustine and the Limits of Virtue** 1992, sets the trajectory. There he contends that Augustine reframes the very grammar of **virtue** by placing it under the corrective of **humility** and the primacy of **grace**. Classical **arete** culture assumed that stable habituation guided by **phronesis** could form an excellent life. Wetzel shows that for Augustine such habituation, apart from **caritas**, risks becoming **splendid vices**. The term marks the paradox that human excellences, when ordered by **amor sui**, remain self-exalting forms of **concupiscence**. In a decisive reading of **Confessions** 8, the drama of the will is not a temporary lapse from Aristotelian equilibrium but the condition of a **divided will** that requires **divine healing** rather than technique. Wetzel reads Augustine as redirecting ethical discourse from the acquisition of virtues to the reception of **grace** that reorders love, the classic **ordo amoris**.

This early work engages **MacIntyre** respectfully, crediting After Virtue for exposing the emotivist fragmentation of modern morality, yet pressing a crucial Augustinian counterpoint. Where **MacIntyre** renews **Aristotelian teleology** and the tradition-constituted rationality of practices, Wetzel insists that Augustine subordinates practices to **confession** and **conversion**, under the priority of **gratia sanans** that heals the will. The central doctrine is that **humility** is not one virtue among others but the theological condition by which all virtue becomes **caritas** rather than **libido dominandi** in moral disguise. Wetzel’s argument reframes ethical formation as penitential schooling in love, in which **ecclesial disciplines** cultivate receptivity rather than competence.

#### 3. A Guide for the Perplexed 2010
In **Augustine: A Guide for the Perplexed** 2010, Wetzel renders his Augustinian hermeneutic accessible without flattening complexity. He organizes Augustine’s thought around **God and the self**, **memory and time**, **creation and evil**, **will and grace**, and **church and politics**. On **evil as privatio boni**, Wetzel presses the pastoral stakes, insisting that privation names the unraveling of love under **concupiscence** more than a metaphysical theory. On **time** and **memory** he shows how the distension of the soul calls for the stabilizing presence of **God**, by whom anxious agency is recollected. On **will and grace**, he highlights Augustine’s anti-Pelagian thesis that freedom is not neutral choice but the power to delight in the good, a **libertas** restored by **grace** rather than achieved by training. Political chapters treat the dialectic of **two cities** and the limited goods of the **saeculum**, where peace is always penultimate and susceptible to **libido dominandi**.

The Guide underscores Wetzel’s signature methodological claim that **confession as method** is philosophically fecund. Philosophical theology for Augustine is a speech-act of praise and penitence, not a neutral spectator theory. Thus Wetzel accents the spiritual danger of **libido sciendi**, the lust for mastery that masquerades as knowledge. His Augustinian didactics place **caritas** at the center of understanding, so that theology is accountable to love’s pedagogy. It is a retrieval with modern resonance, contesting **positivist epistemologies** and rival forms of **autonomous subjectivity** through an **affective-cognitive** account of learning God.

#### 4. Political Augustinianism and the Critical Guide 2012
As editor of **Augustine’s City of God: A Critical Guide** 2012, Wetzel curates a conversation that spans metaphysics, exegesis, and politics. His editorial framing treats **The City of God** not as a blueprint for Christendom nor as quietist resignation but as a grammar for living between **civitas terrena** and **civitas Dei**, ordered by divergent loves. Contributors engage **peace**, **justice**, **idolatry**, and the practices that sustain **pilgrim citizenship**. Wetzel’s hand is evident in the emphasis on moral psychology, the force of **libido dominandi** in institutions, and the chastened aspirations of political order under **providence**. He steers the reception away from triumphalist **theology of glory** toward a patient **theology of the cross** that refuses both cynicism and coercive theocracy.

In this venue Wetzel also positions Augustine against modern emancipatory narratives. He measures **liberal optimism** and **revolutionary voluntarism** by Augustine’s dour realism concerning power. Yet he maintains a constructive note in the priority of **peace** and the civic work of **caritas**, insisting that Christians participate in the **common good** without baptizing **empire**. Here his Augustinianism overlaps with **Robert Markus’s** account of the **saeculum** while resisting historicist domestication. The emphasis remains the same: political theology must be an extension of **confession**, vigilant against the seepage of **pride** into institutional virtue.

#### 5. Parting Knowledge 2013 and the epistemics of humility
With **Parting Knowledge: Essays After Augustine** 2013, Wetzel pushes his critique of mastery into the register of epistemology. The title trope, parting knowledge, names a double motion, the relinquishment of **possessive cognition** and the reception of **gifted understanding** under **grace**. He canvasses the spiritual ambivalence of **curiositas** and the tendency of inquiry to slide into **libido sciendi**, where knowledge is hoarded as power. Dialoguing with **Hannah Arendt** on love and worldliness, with **Nietzsche** on mastery and ressentiment, and with **Foucault** on techniques of the self, Wetzel retrieves Augustine’s call to intellectual **humility** as a theological virtue that reorders desire. This is not anti-intellectualism but a judgment on disordered love in knowing.

The essays extend to **language**, where Wetzel follows **Rowan Williams** in reading confessional speech as ascetical practice. He portrays **theology** as an art of truthful desire that refuses the fantasy of autonomous clarity. Augustine’s reflections on **signs and things**, on **interiority** and **illumination**, are recast as disciplines of patience in which **caritas** instructs the mind. Here Wetzel’s philosophical theology meets contemporary debates over **hermeneutics** and **practice**, with a distinct stress on the spiritual stakes of how we come to know. The accent falls again on **grace** and the refusal of **self-mastery**.

#### 6. Doctrinal coordinates: will, grace, and the shape of sanctity
Across these books Wetzel charts doctrinal coordinates that make his contribution to **philosophical theology**. On the **will and grace**, he aligns with Augustine’s anti-Pelagian insistence on **gratia preveniens** and **gratia cooperans**, yet he refracts these through moral psychology rather than scholastic distinction. Freedom is enchanted as the capacity for joy in the good, a power only **caritas** can restore. On **virtue**, he is frank that habituation is not salvific, that virtues detached from **humility** calcify into **splendid vices**, and that the ecclesial life must be cruciform rather than celebratory of excellence. On **sin**, the emphasis falls upon **concupiscence** as a disorder of love, an *incurvatus in se* that deforms knowing, desiring, and acting.

Wetzel’s treatment of **Trinity** and **Christology** is deliberately refracted through practice and perception. He reads **De Trinitate** as training in **image and love**, where the vestigia trinitatis in memory, understanding, and will are exercises in being aligned to **caritas** rather than confident metaphysical proofs. The **incarnation** appears as the pedagogy of humility, the eternal Word accepting the form of a servant to reorder human desire. Although he does not elaborate **atonement theories** in a systematic idiom, his Augustinianism foregrounds the participatory transformation of **sanctification**, in which the gift of the Spirit liberates the will from anxious self-assertion.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates: virtue ethics, secular modernity, and desire
Wetzel’s chief foil remains the confident **virtue ethics** that harvests Augustine as a baptized **Aristotelian**. In dialogue with **MacIntyre**, he concedes the recovery of practices and traditions but insists that Augustinian **humility** under **grace** prevents any moral theory from claiming sovereignty. He also wrestles with **Charles Taylor** on the modern moral imagination, affirming Taylor’s genealogy of **expressivist selfhood** while pressing Augustine’s more corrosive account of **concupiscence**. With **Hannah Arendt** he shares skepticism toward romantic love of the world that masks domination, yet he offers **caritas** as a different economy of attention and responsibility.

Critics sometimes worry that Wetzel’s antipatience with theory tilts toward **fideism**. He answers by showing, through Augustine, that the alternative to grand theory is not irrationalism but **confessional rationality**, ordered by love’s truth. In the wake of **Nietzsche** and **Foucault**, he takes seriously the power dynamics of knowledge and practice, but he refuses a hermeneutic of suspicion that has no grammar for **grace**. The debate is not only academic. For Wetzel, a church that trains in **humility** and **confession** can inhabit politics without capitulating to **libido dominandi**, and can teach knowledge without succumbing to **libido sciendi**.

#### 8. Contributions and limits within philosophical theology
Wetzel’s distinctive contribution is to render **Augustinian moral psychology** serviceable for contemporary **philosophical theology** without domesticating its anti-Pelagian edge. He demonstrates that **confession as method** is a philosophical form, that **humility** is not an add-on virtue but the posture by which **grace** makes moral speech truthful, and that **virtue** requires conversion. He recovers **splendid vices** as a living category for assessing civic and ecclesial excellence, resisting both cynicism and moralism. He presses **memory** and **time** as theological topics that matter for agency, and he rehabilitates **caritas** as the intellectual virtue that orders inquiry.

At the same time, his self-denying ordinance against **systematic theology** can leave certain doctrinal edges blurred. His preference for moral psychology keeps **atonement**, **sacramental economy**, and **ecclesial authority** largely implicit. He remains marked by a suspicion of **metaphysical system** that may understate the constructive gains of classical doctrines like **divine simplicity** or **immutability** when taught under the discipline of **caritas**. Nevertheless, the pedagogical fruit of his Augustinianism is clear, a church and academy cautioned against self-assured moralism and invited into practices of **confession**, **penitence**, and **love**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster perspective, Wetzel’s retrieval of **anti-Pelagian grace**, his demotion of **virtue perfectionism**, and his stress on **humility** and **confession** are salutary. His reading of **splendid vices** resonates with **total depravity** and the insistence that works done apart from **faith** are sin, and his privileging of **caritas** echoes **sanctification** by the Spirit. Yet tensions remain. First, on the principium of theology, Wetzel’s **confessional rationality** risks loosening the formal authority of **sola Scriptura**, since Scripture’s cognitive primacy can be overshadowed by moral-psychological method. A Reformed corrective would insist that **Word and sacrament** as divinely instituted means, rather than practices of virtue per se, norm theology and churchly formation. Second, on **justification and sanctification**, Wetzel’s focus on interior transformation can occlude **forensic justification** and **imputed righteousness**, the **duplex gratia** by which union with Christ yields both acceptance and renewal. Without this forensic anchor, critiques of **virtue** may drift toward therapeutic accounts of agency. Third, on culture and politics, the strong reading of **splendid vices** should be balanced by **common grace**, which grants real, though non-saving, civic virtues and goods among the **two kingdoms**. This guards against quietism and permits principled participation in the **saeculum** under Christ’s kingship. Finally, the Christological and sacramental economy that secures the church’s pilgrim identity calls for thicker doctrinal articulation than Wetzel provides. A Reformed reception would therefore appropriate his Augustinian **humility** and his attack on **libido dominandi** while embedding them within **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **covenant theology**, **monergistic regeneration**, and the public hope of **resurrection** that empowers holy action in history.
