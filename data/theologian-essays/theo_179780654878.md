### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
David Rudolph emerges within the contemporary **Messianic Jewish** movement and the broader **evangelical** academy, a context increasingly shaped by **Second Temple Judaism** studies and the so-called **new perspective on Paul**. His work stands in conscious reaction to the long shadow of **supersessionism**, while remaining anchored in a confessional commitment to **Scripture’s authority** and **Jesus the Messiah**. The formative backdrop is twofold: first, the post-1960s maturation of **Messianic Judaism** as an ecclesial reality seeking to integrate Jewish covenantal life with **faith in Christ**; second, the academic turn that treats Paul as a first-century **Jew** whose mission to **Gentiles** did not nullify Jewish identity or **Torah**. Methodologically Rudolph belongs to the **Paul within Judaism** constellation, but he executes it in an explicitly **evangelical** register, binding exegesis to the canon’s narrative of **covenant** and **eschatological fulfillment**. He employs **halakhic reasoning** to describe practical Jewish communal norms, and he draws on the **sociology of ethnicity** to distinguish soteriological equality from ethnocultural differentiation within the **one body**.

Rudolph’s hermeneutic insists that exegetical claims be tested by historically plausible reconstructions of **diaspora synagogues**, **Judean practice**, and the legal worlds reflected in **Acts** and **Paul**. Accordingly, he foregrounds texts such as **1 Corinthians 7:17–24**, **1 Corinthians 9:19–23**, **Acts 15**, **Romans 11**, and **Romans 14–15** as loci where Paul’s mission logic, ecclesiology, and view of **Torah** can be triangulated. He shares with **E. P. Sanders** the critique of a caricatured Judaism as merit religion, but he resists collapsing **Paul’s gospel** into either a purely covenantal or purely apocalyptic scheme, drawing instead on **John Barclay’s gift** analysis to hold together grace as incongruent with status and yet non-uniform in its social effects. His method integrates **biblical theology** of **covenant** with a fine-grained **historical exegesis**, producing a constructive ecclesiology that he terms **post-supersessionist** and **bilateral**.

#### 2. A Jew to the Jews: Pauline flexibility re-read
Rudolph’s signature monograph, **A Jew to the Jews: Jewish Contours of Pauline Flexibility in 1 Corinthians 9:19–23** (2011; reissued 2016), reframes the famous passage on becoming all things to all people. In contrast to readings that construe Paul’s adaptability as a chameleon-like antinomianism, Rudolph argues that Paul’s missionary **flexibility** occurs within a stable **halakhic** frame. The apostle’s self-description as **a Jew to the Jews** does not presuppose that he had ceased to live as a Jew, but that he variably accentuated shared Jewish practices to maximize **fellowship** and **persuasion** without violating **Torah**. The pattern of circumcising **Timothy** but refusing to circumcise **Titus** becomes a hermeneutical key: Paul’s decisions are governed by **covenantal vocation** and mission, not by a flat negation of **Jewish law**.

Against construals stemming from **Lutheran law-gospel antitheses**, Rudolph aligns with **James D. G. Dunn** and **Mark D. Nanos** in classifying **works of the law** as boundary-maintaining practices, particularly for **Gentiles** under pressure to undergo **proselyte conversion**. Yet Rudolph presses further: because Paul remains **Torah-positive** for Jews in Christ, his so-called concessions in **1 Corinthians 9** are neither theatrical nor cynical. They embody a consistent **olive tree ecclesiology** where the natural branches live their **covenantal life** in Messiah and the wild branches, the **Gentiles**, are grafted in apart from becoming Jews. This reading tightens the link between **mission strategy** and **covenantal identity**, turning **1 Corinthians 9** into a charter for **halakhic pluralism** within the **one body**.

#### 3. The rule in all the churches: identity retention as Pauline norm
Rudolph’s essays on **1 Corinthians 7:17–24** crystalize his program: Paul’s rule in all the churches invites Jews and Gentiles to remain in their **calling**. Circumcision and foreskin, slave and free, are not soteriological differences, but neither are they erased in the ecclesial sphere. For Rudolph, the threefold repetition of **remain as one was called** is no ad hoc instruction but an **apostolic directive**. Jews called in Messiah are to remain Jews, which entails continued **circumcision**, **Sabbath**, **kashrut**, and **festivals** as expressions of **covenantal vocation**. Gentiles called in Messiah are to remain Gentiles without taking on **proselyte circumcision** or becoming obligated to the full **Sinai Torah**, though they are summoned to the **moral law** and to the **Apostolic Decree** for the sake of table fellowship.

The exegetical payoff is twofold. First, **Pauline soteriology** proclaims one **gospel** and one **Messiah**; access is by **grace** through **faith** apart from works, for both Jew and Gentile. Second, **Pauline ecclesiology** recognizes a legitimate **differentiated practice** within that unity. Rudolph argues that this is not ethnic favoritism but a form of **covenantal differentiation** embedded in **Romans 11**, where the **irrevocable gifts and calling** of God to Israel remain operative. The rule in all the churches thus stabilizes **bilateral ecclesiology**: Jews in Christ are sanctified as Jews; Gentiles in Christ are sanctified as Gentiles. The social and liturgical corollary is **halakhic pluralism** without sacramental division.

#### 4. Acts 15 and the Apostolic Decree: a shared table without erasure
A central pillar of Rudolph’s construction is **Acts 15**, which he treats as a normative articulation of **Gentile inclusion** without Jewish erasure. The **Apostolic Decree** functions as a practical set of boundaries, echoing **Leviticus 17–18** and anticipating later discussions of **Noachide** norms, that enables **Jew-Gentile** table fellowship without compelling **proselyte conversion**. Rudolph resists readings that marginalize the decree as temporary mission policy, arguing that its moral and communal logic suits the **diaspora** settings of **Acts** and **Pauline** correspondence. The decree is therefore both an expression of **unity** and a recognition of **difference**, a legal mechanism to sustain **koinonia**.

This line of interpretation engages **N. T. Wright** and **Richard Hays**, who emphasize **new creation** and **ecclesial unity**; Rudolph agrees with their teleology but contests the practical flattening of Jewish practice that sometimes follows. He aligns more closely with **Mark Nanos** in emphasizing the **synagogue** as a plausible site of early **Christ-believing** life, in which **Jewish Christ-believers** would naturally continue **Torah** practice while **Gentile Christ-believers** maintain the decree’s norms. The point is not casuistry but **ecclesial design**: the **Jerusalem Council** set patterns to guard the **gospel’s freedom** and the **integrity of Israel’s vocation** simultaneously.

#### 5. Romans 14–15 and the olive tree: strength, weakness, and mutual welcome
Rudolph devotes sustained attention to **Romans 14–15**, reading the **strong** and the **weak** not as spiritual maturity levels but as communities negotiating **food** and **days** along Jewish-Gentile lines. The **weak**, often Jews who maintain **Torah** distinctives, are not reproached for legalism; they are affirmed within a community secured by the **Messiah’s** death and resurrection. The **strong**, often Gentiles with a less scrupulous approach to **food laws** and **calendar**, must walk in love, honoring the **weak** without contempt. Rudolph cans the simplistic identification of **weakness** with **Torah** in principle; instead he maps Paul’s exhortations onto a **halakhic pluralism** that preserves **table fellowship**.

Backing this is Rudolph’s **olive tree ecclesiology** from **Romans 11**. Israel’s **irrevocable calling** is neither suspended nor absorbed into the Gentile mission. The **fullness of the nations** does not annul the **root’s holiness**; rather it depends upon it. On this basis Rudolph proposes an **eschatological** horizon where the **one body** manifests differentiated faithfulness until the **resurrection**, anticipating the **all Israel** hope without coercing current **Jewish** disciples into cultural assimilation. Here Rudolph converses with **John Barclay** on the incongruity of **grace** and with **Paula Fredriksen** on the social shape of early Christ-believing groups, insisting that Paul’s pastoral labor is to nurture **mutual welcome** across covenantal difference.

#### 6. Introduction to Messianic Judaism: ecclesial implications and theological architecture
The edited volume **Introduction to Messianic Judaism** with **Joel Willitts** (2013) maps the ecclesial and theological terrain of the **Messianic Jewish** movement for the wider **evangelical** world. Rudolph’s contributions in that collection and elsewhere articulate a theological architecture built on **covenant**, **Torah**, **Messiah**, and **Spirit**, framed by the biblical story from **Abraham** through **Pentecost**. Central for Rudolph is **covenantal vocation**: **Torah observance** for Jewish believers is not a means of justification, but a Spirit-enabled pattern of sanctified life consistent with **Israel’s election**. Conversely, **Gentile** believers fulfill their vocation by embodying the **moral law** and the **Apostolic Decree** in ways congruent with their nations and cultures, all under the lordship of **Jesus**.

Rudolph argues that **halakhic diversity** within the **one body** does not violate **unity**, any more than the continued existence of men and women, masters and freedpersons in early house-churches nullified their oneness in **Christ**. His proposals critique both **supersessionist covenant theology**, which collapses Israel’s enduring vocation into the church’s identity, and a simplistic **dispensationalism** that risks bifurcating the **people of God** into two unrelated plans. He navigates a **post-supersessionist** middle path: one **new humanity** with differentiated **callings**, joined sacramentally and missionally, awaiting a shared **eschatological** consummation.

#### 7. Galatians and the proselyte question: boundary markers without assimilation
In debates over **Galatians**, Rudolph insists that the letter targets the **proselyte** program pressing **Gentiles** to adopt **circumcision** as entry into Israel, not **Torah faithfulness** among Jews. In step with **new perspective** insights yet attentive to **apocalyptic** motifs, he reads **works of the law** as practices that, when imposed on **Gentiles**, compromise the **truth of the gospel**. The **faithfulness of the Messiah** and the **gift of the Spirit** instantiate Gentile inclusion without proselyte conversion. Yet, Rudolph resists projecting this polemic onto **Jewish** believers; for them Paul remains **Torah-positive**, balancing **Galatians** with **1 Corinthians 7**, **Acts 21**, and **Romans 14**.

Rudolph here engages **N. T. Wright** on covenant renewal, **James Dunn** on boundary markers, and **John Barclay** on the social incongruity of the **gift**. He adds to these by deploying a **halakhic** lens: Paul’s instruction to **Peter** in **Galatians 2** is not a ban on Jewish table practice as such, but a rebuke of withdrawal that denied **Gentile** status in Messiah. The upshot is a Pauline theology that secures both **justification by faith** and **covenantal differentiation**. For Rudolph, **Galatians** opposes Gentile **assimilation** into Jewish identity while protecting Jewish **continuity** in the **Messiah**.

#### 8. Theological synthesis: one gospel, differentiated sanctification, and mission
Across these studies Rudolph articulates a synthesis: one **gospel** under one **Messiah**, yet differentiated **sanctification** grounded in **covenantal vocation**. The **Spirit** is the agent who empowers both Jews and Gentiles to fulfill their callings; he fulfills the **law** in the sense of internalizing the **moral law** in all believers and enabling **Torah** observance for Jewish disciples as a sign of **Israel’s election**. This produces a liturgical and communal life where **Sabbath** and **festivals** may be honored by Jewish believers, while Gentiles keep the **Apostolic Decree** and cultivate holiness according to the **moral law**. The sacraments, for Rudolph, are shared means of grace that enact **one body** unity without erasing **difference**.

Missiologically Rudolph retrieves Paul’s slogan **to the Jew first** as an ongoing priority, without denying universal mission. He envisages **synagogues** and **churches** cooperating where possible, and **Messianic Jewish** congregations as legitimate ecclesial forms within the wider church. His **olive tree ecclesiology** frames Christian-Jewish relations as mutual blessing: Gentiles receive nourishment from Israel’s **root**, while Jewish believers bear **firstfruits** that anticipate the **all Israel** hope. The result is a pastoral program of **mutual welcome**, **table fellowship**, and **holiness** that seeks to resolve the long-running scandal of Christian **supersessionism**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation: promises, law, and the shape of unity
From a **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Rudolph’s work offers salutary correctives and clear points of tension. Positively, his robust reading of **Romans 11** affirms **Israel’s irrevocable election**, resists **supersessionism**, and honors the canonical trajectory of **covenant** culminating in **Christ**. His insistence on one **gospel** and justification by **grace** through **faith** coheres with **sola fide**. His exegesis of **1 Corinthians 7**, **Acts 15**, and **Romans 14–15** fruitfully illumines **adiaphora**, **weak-strong** dynamics, and the demands of **love** in mixed communities. Yet classical Reformed theology, guided by **WCF 19** on the threefold law and the **abrogation of ceremonial law**, will resist treating ongoing **Torah observance** as a binding **covenantal vocation** for Jewish Christians. The Reformed tradition reads **Hebrews** as teaching that the ceremonial shadows are fulfilled and set aside in the **new covenant** economy. Where Rudolph discerns **halakhic pluralism** as a stable ecclesial principle, the Reformed see **liberty of conscience** permitting Jewish practice as **indifferent** matters for the sake of mission, but not as covenantally obligatory. Moreover, the Reformed fear that **bilateral ecclesiology** risks softening the **one new man** reality of **Ephesians 2**, and potentially re-inscribing ethnic partitions that the **gospel** has transcended. A constructive alternative within Reformed orthodoxy would affirm **Israel’s future fullness** and the permanence of the **moral law**, welcome cultural Jewish practice as **adiaphora** under pastoral prudence, and locate Christian unity in shared **word and sacrament**, where the single **covenant of grace** reaches its telos in **Christ** for Jew and Gentile alike.
