### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Lee Martin **McDonald** stands as a major contemporary architect of the study of the **biblical canon**, working within a late twentieth and early twenty-first century world captivated by **Second Temple Judaism**, **patristic historiography**, and the complex transmission of **Scripture**. As an evangelical-leaning scholar trained in the **historical-critical** tradition and long associated with **Acadia Divinity College**, McDonald brought a rigorous yet church-facing sensibility to debates formerly dominated by either confessional apologetics or critical skepticism, insisting that **canon formation** must be described through painstaking historical reconstruction. In contrast to harmonizing narratives of fixed lists descending unbroken from the **apostles**, he proposed a historically emergent model in which the categories of **Scripture**, **authority**, and **canon** develop through layered practices of reading, worship, and adjudication. His method triangulates **textual criticism**, **socio-historical analysis**, and reception history, while granting a theological role to the **Holy Spirit** in communal recognition without collapsing that recognition into an instantaneous decree.

McDonald’s early training immersed him in debates framed by **F. F. Bruce** on the one side and **Brevard Childs** and **James A. Sanders** on the other, debates about whether **canon** is primarily a closed list, a hermeneutical principle, or an ecclesial achievement. He learned from **Childs** the power of a canonical approach to **Scripture’s final form**, yet he resisted reducing **canon** to a hermeneutic that brackets real historical contingency. From **Sanders** he adopted attentiveness to **community shaping Scripture**, while testing that claim by tracking concrete evidence in **Eusebius**, **Athanasius**, and **Conciliar** decrees. His method, therefore, never treats **canon** as an abstract idea detached from catalogues, codices, and liturgical deployment. He synchronizes **Josephus’s** list of twenty-two books, **the Muratorian Fragment**, **Origen’s** citations, and **Athanasius’s Festal Letter 39** to plot the canon’s emerging contours, then interprets those contours with the categories **apostolicity**, **orthodoxy**, **antiquity**, and **catholic usage**.

#### 2. Major works and the core thesis
The argument first achieved full profile in **The Formation of the Christian Biblical Canon** 1988, later revised in 1995 and 1999, where McDonald assembled the scattered evidence for both **Old Testament** and **New Testament** lists, underscoring that early Christians possessed **Scripture** well before they possessed a universally fixed **canon**. A central refrain appears here and returns across his career: **Scripture** functions as revered, Spirit-inspired tradition long before communities close a **canon** as a normative list. In **The Canon Debate** 2002, co-edited with **James A. Sanders**, McDonald curated essays from divergent schools, staging a conversation between **Roger Beckwith’s** early closure thesis for the **Hebrew Bible**, **Childs’s** canonical approach to exegesis, and historical studies like **Harry Y. Gamble** on books and readers. McDonald’s own contributions argued for an extended process of closure, especially in the **Old Testament** where the **Septuagint** served as the operative Bible for Greek-speaking Jews and the early church, with a wider literary horizon than the later **Masoretic** tradition would finally sanction.

The consolidation of these themes arrives in **The Biblical Canon: Its Origin, Transmission, and Authority** 2007 and in his synthetic **The Formation of the Bible: The Story of the Church’s Canon** 2012, culminating in the large study **The Formation of the Biblical Canon** Volumes 1 and 2 in 2017. Across these works McDonald refines several theses with cumulative weight: the **Jamnia** or **Yavneh** hypothesis of a decisive first-century rabbinic closure is a myth, the **Old Testament** remained pluriform in content and text into late antiquity, and the **New Testament** moved from a core of four **Gospels** and **Pauline** letters toward a stabilized list only in the fourth century with **Athanasius** and North African **councils**. He practices meticulous source scrutiny, sifting **Melito of Sardis**, **Origen**, **Eusebius**, and **Jerome** to show that **homologoumena** and **antilegomena** categories persisted, with the **Shepherd of Hermas**, **Didache**, **1 Clement**, and **Barnabas** hovering as edifying but disputed literature.

#### 3. Scripture, canon, and criteria of recognition
A hallmark of McDonald’s canonology is the distinction between **Scripture** and **canon**, where **Scripture** denotes writings received as sacred and authoritative, while **canon** denotes a closed, normative list binding for a community. Early Christian communities, he argues, read and prayed **Sirach**, **Wisdom of Solomon**, **Baruch**, and **1–2 Maccabees** as Scripture within the **Septuagint** tradition, even though later **Jerome** and post-Tanakh Jewish traditions narrowed the borders. This distinction allows McDonald to capture the lived authority of texts before conciliar lists and to explain why **patristic** authors could cite **Wisdom** or **Sirach** with formulae of scriptural authority and yet hesitate to list them among canonical books. The criteria for recognition that emerge from the sources are **apostolicity** for the New Testament, **consistency with the regula fidei** for orthodoxy, **antiquity** and **propheticity**, and **catholic usage** in liturgy. McDonald is careful to note that these criteria did not function as abstract tests, but as retrospective rationalizations of communal instincts shaped by worship and catechesis.

Within this framework, **authority** rests neither in a putative authorial autograph merely, nor in a bare ecclesiastical decree, but in a dynamic reciprocal relation of text, community, and **Spirit**. The **Holy Spirit**, for McDonald, does not operate as a private witness detached from historical mediation, but as the divine agent animating the church’s discernment across centuries. He draws here on early theological claims about the **Spirit** guiding councils and on rhetorical appeals like **Athanasius’s** insistence that catholic usage evidences divine providence. Yet McDonald also resists the easy flattening of history into inevitability. He insists that reception is contested, that texts like **Revelation**, **Hebrews**, **James**, and **2 Peter** underwent protracted scrutiny, and that even after formal closure, the border between **canonical** and **ecclesiastical** books remained porous in practice.

#### 4. The Old Testament canon: pluriformity and the Septuagint
McDonald’s Old Testament work challenges the notion of an early, rigid **Hebrew canon**, a thesis associated in modern scholarship with **Roger Beckwith**. He marshals evidence from **Qumran** that textual pluriformity prevailed, with multiple editions of **Jeremiah**, **Samuel**, and the **Pentateuch**, and with community documents that blur lines between inspired interpretation and base text. He points to **Josephus’s** tally of twenty-two books, yet argues that the shape and rationale of that count remain debated and do not by themselves prove a closed list controlling diaspora Judaism. He emphasizes instead the liturgical and pedagogical reality that the **Septuagint** functioned as Scripture for many Jews and for the early church, and that Christian reliance on the **Septuagint** anchored the status of **deuterocanonical** books as Scripture in significant locales.

By framing the **Septuagint** as the church’s Old Testament, McDonald can explain patristic variance, such as **Augustine’s** broad canon in North Africa and **Jerome’s** preference for the **Hebrew veritas**, and he can interpret councils like **Hippo** 393 and **Carthage** 397 as codifying existing practice rather than innovating. He underscores the symbolic three-part division of **Law**, **Prophets**, and **Writings**, noting **Luke 24.44**, while arguing that the internal borders of the **Writings** remained fluid. This portrait of pluriformity serves McDonald’s larger thesis that canonization is not merely a literary achievement but a communal and liturgical process of stabilization under **providence** and **Spirit**.

#### 5. The New Testament canon: core and periphery
For the New Testament McDonald narrates a centripetal story that begins with the four-fold **Gospel** and a corpus of **Pauline** letters that were early recognized as authoritative Scripture. He shows that by the late second century, writers like **Irenaeus** and **Tertullian** defended the **tetramorph** Gospel and cited **Paul** with scriptural rhetoric, yet lists remained elastic in the so-called **antilegomena**. The **Muratorian Fragment** supplies a snapshot of Western acceptance, and **Origen** and **Eusebius** arrange books into accepted, disputed, and spurious. McDonald reads **Eusebius** not as inventing categories but as reporting widespread practice, which widened the circle of confidence around the four **Gospels**, **Acts**, thirteen **Paulines**, and **1 Peter** and **1 John**, while leaving **James**, **Jude**, **2 Peter**, **2–3 John**, **Hebrews**, and **Revelation** in varying degrees of contestation.

The path to stabilization culminates in **Athanasius’s Festal Letter 39** in 367, which lists the twenty-seven books, followed by the conciliar affirmations at **Hippo** and **Carthage**. McDonald interprets these not as creating canon ex nihilo, but as episcopal recognition of an emergent consensus. He stresses that edifying works like the **Shepherd of Hermas** were still commended for private reading, which discloses a practical hierarchy within literature. The core-periphery model thus illuminates both decisive centers of gravity and lingering edges, and supports McDonald’s often repeated axiom that the **New Testament** had a functional canon long before a fixed canon, and that formal closure was a fourth-century event of recognition rather than an act of imposition.

#### 6. Jesus, history, and faith as canon environment
Although canon is McDonald’s signature theme, his **The Story of Jesus in History and Faith** 2013 situates his canon work within a broader hermeneutic of historical inquiry and theological confession. Here **historical-critical** tools probe the **Gospels** as historical memories, while an account of **faith** articulates how communities receive the **Christ** witnessed in these texts. The book’s argument aligns with his canon thesis: the **church’s Jesus** is not constructed apart from sources, nor reducible to positivist history, but is confessed through historically mediated witnesses that the **Spirit** unites to the church’s **regula fidei**. This dovetailing reinforces his view that the **authority of Scripture** arises within the interplay of text, history, and Spirit-enabled recognition, a triad that also governs how a list of books came to be called **canon**.

In this framework, **apostolicity** functions not as a crude authorship claim, but as a criterion of proximity to the apostolic witness, which explains why **Luke** and **Mark** gained status by association with **Paul** and **Peter**. **Orthodoxy**, articulated as consonance with the church’s **rule of faith**, provided a doctrinal sieve, eliminating heterodox gospels and gnostic writings. **Catholicity**, measured in widespread liturgical use across churches, indicates the communal scope of recognition. McDonald’s synthesis thus crafts a robust picture of how doctrinal, historical, and ecclesial factors converge in the emergence of a normative **canon**.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and the problem of closure
McDonald’s work is dialogical, engaging **F. F. Bruce** on the dating of closure, **Roger Beckwith** on the status of the **Hebrew canon**, **Brevard Childs** on canonical hermeneutics, and **James A. Sanders** on community formation. He critiques **Bruce** and evangelical narratives that infer early fixation from early usage, arguing that early authority does not entail early closure. He appreciates **Childs’s** insistence on a theological reading of the final form, yet insists that theological reading must not ignore the historical processes that produced that form. He agrees with **Sanders** on the centrality of community, though he tempers the thesis by tracking specific catalogues and disputations. McDonald also confronts lingering myths, especially the decisive **Jamnia** council, which he recasts as a later projection masking a much more gradual and complex Jewish and Christian scriptural history.

The problem of closure remains the crux. McDonald posits that closure is a practical function of authority, achieved when a community regards certain books as uniquely normative for doctrine and worship. Closure need not be metaphysically absolute to be binding, nor does the presence of marginal debates negate a real consensus. By staging closure as a Spirit-guided recognition rather than miraculous dictation, he affirms that **providence** operates through ordinary ecclesial means, such as episcopal letters, synods, and the slow convergence of reading practices. The canon’s authority therefore rests in the Spirit’s governance of the church’s communal life, not in an ahistorical decree and not merely in scholarly reconstruction.

#### 8. Authority, inspiration, and textual pluriformity
McDonald addresses **inspiration** in ways consistent with his historical sensibility. He rejects the idea that inspiration extends only to hypothetical autographs in order to preserve an abstract **inerrancy**, and instead argues that inspiration characterizes Scripture as received in the church across its textual history. The reality of **textual pluriformity** in the **Septuagint** and **Masoretic** traditions, and the multiform manuscript evidence for the **New Testament**, compel a doctrine of authority resilient to textual variation. Authority is not undermined by pluriform texts, he insists, because the Spirit’s providential care yields a stable theological witness through and across textual witnesses. Here he cites both patristic comfort with textual plurality and modern **textual criticism** as allies of a chastened yet confident doctrine of Scripture.

This account also makes space for the ecclesial role in maintaining and transmitting Scripture. Scribes, lectors, bishops, and catechists serve as instruments of **providence** in much the same way that councils do. The canon does not float above the church as a purely divine index, nor does the church create it ex nihilo. Rather, the church receives and recognizes what has compelled its faith and shaped its worship under the **Spirit** who binds text and people in a living rule. McDonald’s emphasis on reception as a participatory process aims to avoid both authoritarian decrees and modern individualism, grounding **authority** in a lived tradition that is neither infallibilist nor skeptical.

#### 9. Legacy and influence
The cumulative effect of McDonald’s corpus has been to reset the baseline for discussing **canon** in both academy and church. Students now learn to distinguish **Scripture** from **canon**, to map **homologoumena** and **antilegomena**, and to read **Athanasius’s** list not as the first instance of the obvious but as a late codification of a maturing process. His work is quoted alongside **F. F. Bruce**, **Childs**, and **Beckwith** as a standard reference point, and his co-edited **The Canon Debate** 2002 created a forum that continues to shape research agendas. In classrooms and seminaries, his argument encourages a posture that is both historically honest and theologically hopeful, one that treats the **Spirit** as active not in bypassing history but in redeeming it for the church’s good.

McDonald’s influence also extends to ecumenical conversations about the **deuterocanon**, where his acknowledgment of pluriform usage and his stress on the **Septuagint** provide a historical rationale for why Catholic and Orthodox canons differ from many Protestant lists. Moreover, his articulation of criteria such as **apostolicity** and **catholicity** offers a way to discuss disputed writings without collapsing into relativism. For evangelical readers, his approach has prompted a reexamination of simplistic claims about early closure and urged a thicker doctrine of **providence** and **Spirit** in relation to Scripture.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, McDonald’s historical clarity is salutary, yet his communal emphasis risks sliding toward a **community-constituted canon** rather than a canon that is **self-authenticating** under the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**. Reformed theology has insisted on the autopistia of Scripture, its intrinsic authority, as recognized, not constituted, by the church, and on the ministerial, not magisterial, role of councils. McDonald often affirms recognition language and the **Spirit’s** agency, but because he locates authority in the reciprocal relation of text and church, his model can be read as granting the community a determinate role that exceeds mere recognition. On the **Old Testament**, his case for ongoing pluriformity is historically persuasive, yet Reformed writers will appeal to **Luke 24.44**, **Josephus**, and the early tripartite structure to argue for substantial closure prior to the church’s formal lists, thus safeguarding the unity of the covenantal canon. On **inspiration**, his critique of autograph-only inerrancy intersects with a healthy Reformed respect for **textual criticism**, though WTS readers will press for a robust account of **verbal plenary inspiration** and inerrancy that acknowledges textual history while locating ultimate authority in the Spirit-breathed text God intended the church to have. In sum, McDonald’s descriptive account should be received, refined by a covenantal ontology of revelation, calibrated by the **regula fidei** as derivative of Scripture rather than constitutive, and anchored in the **Spirit’s** sovereign witness that renders the canon authoritative *quia* it is the Word of God and not *quatenus* it is received by the church.
