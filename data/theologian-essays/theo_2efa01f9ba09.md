### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Frank Pasquale emerges as a leading analyst of **algorithmic power** within the unsettled social order produced by the **2008 financial crisis**, the subsequent consolidation of **platform capitalism**, and the diffusion of **machine learning** into finance, health, media, and governance. Trained in law and political economy, with appointments at the **University of Maryland Carey School of Law** and later **Brooklyn Law School**, his work enters the public square at precisely the moment when **search engines**, **social media**, and **high-frequency trading** rewire the flows of information and money. He is not a theologian in confessional sense, yet his defense of **human dignity**, his concern for the **common good**, and his critique of **idolatrous technocracy** place him squarely within debates that theologians of culture and society must address.

Pasquale's method is legal realist and normative, blending **critical political economy**, **administrative and antitrust law**, and a humanistic account of **professional expertise**. He exposes the infrastructures that make **ranking, rating, and scoring** authoritative in markets and bureaucracies, then proposes reforms to realign these infrastructures with **equity, accountability, and public reason**. His signature move is the demystification of **black boxes**. He narrates how secrecy, trade secrecy in particular, and information asymmetries enable automation to govern without intelligible justification, thereby eroding **deliberative democracy**. Theologically freighted categories such as **power**, **dignity**, and **responsibility** are treated through the institutional lenses of **regulation**, **guild-like professionalism**, and **public oversight**.

In intellectual milieu, Pasquale converses with **Julie Cohen** on informational capitalism, **Shoshana Zuboff** on **surveillance capitalism**, **Lawrence Lessig** on **code as law**, **Helen Nissenbaum** on **contextual integrity**, **Danielle Citron** on **cyber civil rights**, and **Kate Crawford** on extractive **AI infrastructures**. He draws selectively from **Foucault** on power and knowledge, but insists that critique advance beyond diagnosis to institutional design. The result is a jurisprudence of **algorithmic accountability** that aspires to protect **human agency** within technosocial systems bent toward opacity and control. In theological idiom, one could say he seeks to order the **principalities and powers** so that they serve rather than subjugate **imago Dei** bearers.

#### 2. The Black Box Society 2015
Pasquale's major early statement, **The Black Box Society** 2015, names a regime in which decisive rankings and decisions are made inside proprietary or inscrutable systems. He anatomizes three sites of power. First, **reputation systems** that score persons for employment, credit, or insurance by aggregating data streams, often with **proxy discrimination** masked by complex models. Second, **search engines and social networks** that arbitrate visibility through opaque **ranking algorithms**, thereby shaping public discourse and market access while disclaiming editorial responsibility. Third, **finance** where high-speed trading and exotic instruments hide risk and distort markets through **informational asymmetry**. These spheres share a legal architecture of **trade secrecy**, **weak disclosure**, and **contract of adhesion**, producing a pervasive deficit of **explanation**.

The normative core of **The Black Box Society** is a program of **algorithmic accountability** anchored in public law and institutional reform. Pasquale calls for **auditing**, both internal and external, rights of **explanation and contestation**, **data protection** modeled on stronger European regimes, and the treatment of dominant platforms as **public utilities** obligated to fairness, nondiscrimination, and due process. He resists the fatalism that treats opacity as inevitable technical complexity, arguing that law has been mobilized to produce secrecy and can be mobilized to produce **legibility**. The book challenges techno-utopian claims that more data will self-correct bias, insisting instead on **procedural justice** and **substantive equality**. For theologians concerned with **truth-telling** and the moral order of speech, his emphasis on transparency and **explainability** answers the distortions generated by pseudo-omniscient ranking.

A key contribution here is Pasquale's account of **ranking, rating, and scoring** as a liturgy of worth. He shows how numerically mediated creditworthiness or influence becomes a secular sacrament of merit. Theologically inclined readers will recognize a critique of **meritocracy** and the exposure of hidden **partiality** embedded in data. The proposed path forward is not an anemic proceduralism but an institutional ethic of **care and accountability** that disciplines computational systems through **public oversight** and **professional responsibility**.

#### 3. New Laws of Robotics 2020
With **New Laws of Robotics** 2020, Pasquale shifts from diagnosis to a constructive charter for **AI governance**. He contests **automation bias** and the ideology that machines should replace rather than augment human professionals. His central thesis is **professional complementarity**. Complex services in medicine, education, law, and social work should be redesigned so that robotic and algorithmic systems enhance the craft judgment of **physicians**, **teachers**, **lawyers**, and **caregivers**, rather than displace them. He argues that market pressures to deskill labor and reduce costs often drive substitution, but that such substitution degrades **dignity**, undermines **accountability**, and erodes the **relational goods** at the heart of care.

The titular **new laws of robotics** distill this normative stance into widely cited principles. Robotic and AI systems should complement human professionals and support the flourishing of **human expertise**. They should not counterfeit or impersonate human beings in ways that confuse accountability and erode **trust**. They should not be weaponized to intensify asymmetries of **surveillance, manipulation, and harassment** in zero-sum contests for attention or profit. They should be traceable to responsible **human principals**, with clear lines of **liability** and **governance**. The details track Pasquale's broader commitments to **institutional design** and **administrative oversight**. In practical terms, he advocates for **public options** in digital services, standards for **auditability**, and procurement rules that privilege systems which advance **equity** and **care**.

New Laws of Robotics offers a counter-imaginary to both transhumanist aspiration and austerity-driven automation. Pasquale depicts an economy where **guild-like professions** act as countervailing powers against platform dominance, not to entrench privilege but to sustain trustworthy practices ordered to the **common good**. He appropriates **antitrust** to check concentration, **labor law** to valorize care work, and **data protection** to prevent exploitation. Theologically, one hears an echo of **vocation** and **office**, where the dignity of specialized service bears a public charge. The book thereby reframes AI not as an autonomous eschaton but as a set of tools that must be called to account before norms of **justice and mercy**.

#### 4. Essays, handbooks, and the architecture of accountability
Beyond his monographs, Pasquale curates and advances a field. He co-edited **The Oxford Handbook of Ethics of AI** 2020 with **Markus D. Dubber** and **Sunit Das**, assembling interdisciplinary approaches that range from philosophical analyses of **autonomy** to legal treatments of **liability** and **privacy**. He warns against **ethics washing**, the use of soft principles to deflect calls for regulation, and instead returns readers to the hard work of **institutional capacity** building. This insistence reverberates across essays such as **A Rule of Persons, Not Machines** 2019, where he argues that legal authority should remain traceable to accountable persons, and **Data as Capital** 2019, which interrogates the accumulation of informational assets as a new source of **domination**.

His policy work sketches concrete frameworks for **platform utility regulation**, **public control of critical infrastructures**, and **algorithmic auditing**. Pasquale proposes sectoral governance attuned to contexts like **healthcare**, where data practices and robotics uniquely implicate **vulnerability** and **trust**. He favors standards bodies, ombuds offices, and advisory councils equipped to contest **black box** claims of trade secrecy. This is not mere technocracy. It is a normative project oriented by the **common good**, invoking ideas akin to **subsidiarity** and **solidarity**, though mediated through secular law. Theologically considered, his institutional imagination offers tools for resisting the **totalizing** tendencies of platforms by distributing authority and dignifying **local practices** of care.

Pasquale's writing intersects with and sometimes diverges from adjacent thinkers. With **Julie Cohen**, he shares attention to the **entanglement of law and market power**, though he emphasizes professional orders more than infrastructural constitutionalism. With **Shoshana Zuboff**, he critiques **surveillance capitalism**, yet he stresses public utility obligations and professional counterweights where she stresses legal prohibition and rights. With **Helen Nissenbaum**, he values **contextual integrity**, yet he foregrounds ex ante **institutional oversight** beyond consent-centered privacy. These constellations locate Pasquale within a pragmatic reform tradition committed to restraining **private government** by law.

#### 5. Theological stakes and conceptual translation
While explicit doctrine is not Pasquale's register, his project can be translated for systematic theology. The defense of **human expertise** presumes a robust **theological anthropology**. Persons are not bundles of predictions but **imago Dei** bearers whose practical wisdom, or *phronesis*, matures within **offices** and **vocations** shaped by traditions of practice. The critique of **black box society** echoes a commitment to **truthfulness**, where authority must render reasons and submit to scrutiny consonant with **justice**. The proposed **public utility** approach aligns with an ordered vision of the **common good** that resists both centralized domination and anarchic markets, a balance reminiscent of **subsidiarity and solidarity** in Christian social reflection.

Moreover, Pasquale's attention to **ranking, rating, and scoring** as quasi-sacramental rituals of merit touches the theological critique of **idolatry**. When metrics become measures of worth, they threaten to replace **grace** with quantification and **neighbor love** with reputational calculus. The call to limit **automation bias** in care professions upholds the primacy of **presence** and **responsibility** in ministries of healing and teaching. His insistence on keeping **persons in the loop** functions as a reminder that **providence** operates through human agents who bear accountability under God and law. To the extent his program aims to unveil and restrain the **principalities and powers**, it offers theologians a grammar for discerning spirits in our algorithmic age.

#### 6. Limits, tensions, and developments
Despite its many strengths, Pasquale's work raises questions for theological analysis. His confidence in **professionalism** as countervailing power may underestimate the ambivalence of guilds that can both serve and exclude, and it presupposes a supply of virtue that institutions alone cannot guarantee. His preference for **public utility** obligations presumes administrative capacity and probity that may falter under capture by **regulated industries**. The dialectic of **transparency and trade secrecy** is treated mainly as a legal balancing act rather than as a deeper cultural formation in which secrecy can function as a shield for the weak as well as a weapon for the strong. These tensions invite deeper dialogue with theological accounts of **sin**, **institutional fallenness**, and **the noetic effects** of idolatry.

In later essays and public lectures, Pasquale nuances his program by advocating **algorithmic impact assessments**, **participatory design** with affected communities, and cross-border harmonization of **data protection** regimes. He supports **antitrust revival** to address concentration among firms that control **cloud infrastructure** and **AI compute**, alongside measures like **data portability** and **interoperability** to reduce lock-in. The trajectory is consistent with his earlier commitments but more explicit about structural levers. It remains ordered to a moral vision where dignity is not computed, where **care** is not commodified, and where law curbs technological power so that persons can act as responsible agents within shared institutions.

#### 7. Interlocution with broader Christian ethics
Engagement with Christian ethics sharpens both appreciation and critique. Pasquale's emphasis on **institutional design** complements the best of **public theology**, which insists that love of neighbor become concrete in law. His concern for **equity** and rejection of **ethics washing** resonate with prophetic denunciations of unjust balances. Yet his normative vocabulary remains largely within **liberal legalism** and **republican civic virtue**, which may struggle to articulate the depth of covenantal obligations or the eschatological hope that transforms prudence. The church can receive his insights as **common grace** while pressing toward a thicker account of **gift**, **Sabbath**, and **truth** that resists the economization of all value.

Notably, Pasquale's defense of **professional complementarity** bears clear kinship to Christian doctrines of **vocation** and **office**, wherein authority is a form of service ordered to the **common good**. The insistence that robots should not **counterfeit persons** guards against a metaphysical confusion that would flatten the distinction between human beings and artifacts. This line of thought offers an anchor against anthropologies that reduce persons to information patterns. It thereby implicitly supports commitments to **incarnation**, **embodiment**, and **presence** that are central in Christian theology and critical for resisting the abstraction of care into code.

#### 8. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Pasquale's project is a rich instance of **common grace** exposing the **idolatry of metrics** and calling the **principalities and powers** of platform capitalism to account. His **black box society** critique rightly discerns the noetic effects of sin in technocratic claims to neutrality, and his **professional complementarity** aligns with **vocation** and the protection of creaturely limits under **Sabbath**. Yet two tensions call for correction within Reformed orthodoxy. First, Pasquale's procedural and institutional remedies presuppose a normative order that they cannot finally ground. A Reformed account would ground **dignity**, **truthfulness**, and **responsibility** in the triune God, insisting that all knowledge is covenantal and that putative neutrality masks a suppressed knowledge of God. This pushes beyond regulation to a confessional critique of **technological autonomy** as a rival sovereignty. Second, his trust in **public utility** and administrative oversight requires the doctrine of **sphere sovereignty** to delimit the state and platform alike, protecting the distinct ordinances of family, church, civil society, and market. Reformed teaching would thus receive Pasquale's call for **algorithmic accountability**, but situate it within a thicker web of **creational norms**, **covenant law**, and **ecclesial witness**, where the antidote to black boxes is not transparency alone but truthful stewardship under Christ's lordship.
