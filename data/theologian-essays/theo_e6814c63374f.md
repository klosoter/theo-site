### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and setting: an Australian evangelical project of biblical theology
The career of **Graeme Goldsworthy** unfolds within the distinctive ecology of **Sydney Anglican** evangelicalism, centered at **Moore Theological College**, where he studied and later taught, and where the **Robinson-Knox** emphasis on the **gospel of the kingdom** and the primacy of *Verkündigung* marked a sober alternative to both liberal **historical criticism** and pietistic proof-texting. His formation coincided with the late-twentieth-century reassessment of **biblical theology** after the collapse of the mid-century movement criticized by **James Barr**. Within this context, Goldsworthy pursued a hermeneutic that rescues **salvation-history** from historicist reduction and rescues **systematic theology** from abstraction, by tethering both to the **Christological** center. His institutional home, **Moore College**, prized rigorous exegesis and catechetical clarity; his ministry experience in parishes kept his scholarship aimed at **preaching** and catechesis. The result is an accessible but conceptually serious synthesis organized around the **kingdom of God**, a theme he renders as God’s people in God’s place under God’s rule and blessing.

The intellectual field into which **Goldsworthy** spoke was crowded with rival programs. The **canonical** project of **Brevard Childs** sought Scripture’s final form; the **promise-plan** of **Walter Kaiser** argued for a single sense rooted in divine promises; the **redemptive-historical** approach of **Geerhardus Vos** and **Edmund Clowney** traced revelation’s progressive unfolding unto **eschatology**. Goldsworthy stands at a useful intersection: like **Vos**, he sees revelation as an organism, and like **Childs**, he respects the final canonical shape. Yet he insists that the rule of **Christ’s gospel** supplies the proper hermeneutical key, not a mere theme among others. That is, the evangel does not simply crown the narrative; it governs the reading from the ground up.

#### 2. Method: the gospel as hermeneutical norm under the lordship of Christ
Goldsworthy’s method is a deliberate construal of **hermeneutics** under the **lordship of Christ** and the **analogia fidei**. In **Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics** 2006 he argues that the gospel functions as the primary norm of interpretation, not simply a theological implication of exegesis. This stance refuses the methodological naturalism of mainstream **historical criticism**, insisting that knowledge of God is mediated by the **evangel** of the crucified and risen **Christ**. Epistemologically, the gospel establishes a new creation horizon such that Scripture’s parts are properly known only within the whole economy of **revelation** and **redemption**. He borrows the language of horizons and the hermeneutical circle, but renders the circle christologically: readers are converted by the **Word**, which thereby furnishes the conditions for faithful reading. His polemical target is twofold: autonomous reason, and atomistic biblicism. Against the former, he asserts that spiritual things are spiritually discerned; against the latter, he insists that all texts stand within the **salvation-historical** matrix that climaxes in **Christology** and **eschatology**.

This method yields a principled use of **typology**. For Goldsworthy, typology is not allegory but the textual recognition that God’s acts and institutions are patterned toward a *telos* in **Christ**. The **exodus**, **Davidic kingship**, **temple**, and **wisdom** exhibit structures that are both historical and promissory. The original sense is not obliterated by fulfillment; rather, its significance is anchored in the **divine intention** to recapitulate Israel’s story in **Jesus Messiah**. This typological conviction grounds his well-known kingdom formula. The creative synthesis is to redescribe Israel’s institutions and experiences as anticipations of the reality that is finally the people, place, and rule of God realized in the **church** and consummated in the **new creation**.

#### 3. Programmatic works: consolidating a gospel-shaped biblical theology
Goldsworthy’s earliest programmatic text, **Gospel and Kingdom** 1981, lays out the kingdom schema that has become his signature: the pattern of the kingdom in **Eden**, the perished kingdom after the **fall**, the promised kingdom to **Abraham**, the partial kingdom under **Moses** and **David**, the prophesied kingdom in the **prophets**, the present kingdom in **Christ**, the proclaimed kingdom in the **church**, and the perfected kingdom in the **new creation**. The simplicity of the formula hides a conceptual tightness that treats **covenant**, **land**, **temple**, and **kingship** as historically concrete typologies rather than abstractions. In **According to Plan** 1991; rev. 2002 he expands the schema into a full introductory **biblical theology**, carefully relating **creation**, **fall**, **promise**, **law**, **prophets**, **wisdom**, **gospels**, and **epistles** to the central **evangel**. He reframes the unity of Scripture not by harmonizing details but by integrating their contribution to the one **gospel**.

He then treats test cases: **The Gospel in Revelation** 1984 argues that **Apocalypse** is not a puzzle-book but the climactic proclamation of the **Lamb’s** victory and the arrival of the **kingdom**. **Gospel and Wisdom** 1987 challenges the idée reçue that Israel’s **wisdom literature** is secular or de-theologized by grounding it in covenantal **fear of the Lord** and reading **Proverbs**, **Job**, and **Ecclesiastes** through **Christ as the wisdom of God**. The collected volume, **The Goldsworthy Trilogy** 2000, made the project easily accessible to ministers and students, while **Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture** 2000 translated the method into homiletics. Throughout, the core is constant: the **gospel** is the hermeneutical norm, the **kingdom** is the integrating motif, and **Christ** is the fulfillment of all Scripture.

#### 4. Kingdom of God: people, place, rule, and blessing fulfilled in Christ
The heart of Goldsworthy’s contribution is the thick description of the **kingdom of God**. He defines it as God’s people in God’s place under God’s rule and blessing. Each term is exegetically indexed. God’s people are concretely Israel, then the remnant, then the disciples and the **church** as the renewed Israel in **Christ**; God’s place is **Eden**, then **Canaan**, then **Zion**, then **Christ** as true **temple**, then the **church** as temple-inhabited by the **Spirit**, and finally the **new heavens and new earth**; God’s rule is mediated through **law**, **wisdom**, **kingship**, and prophetic **word**, fulfilled by **Messiah** as **Lord**. The **blessing** dimension guards against a formal, bare-suzerainty account: God’s rule is life-giving communion.

This schema is not a mere theme-hunting exercise. Goldsworthy’s contention is that the **kingdom** is the structural mode by which **covenant** realities come to expression. **Abrahamic** promise, **Mosaic** law, and **Davidic** kingship are aspects of how God forms a people in a place under his rule. This allows him to present the **new covenant** as the climactic reconstitution of the kingdom: a people renewed by the **Spirit**, a place re-centered in **Christ** and extended to the eschatological cosmos, a rule interiorized as **Torah** written on the heart. The result is a **Christological** and **ecclesiological** articulation of Scripture’s unity that is friendly to catechesis, preaching, and mission.

#### 5. Wisdom and apocalypse: integrating diverse biblical genres
A notable test of any **biblical theology** is its account of **wisdom** and **apocalyptic**. In **Gospel and Wisdom** Goldsworthy argues that the fear of the Lord is not natural theology in a neutral key but covenantal response structured by **creation** and interpreted by **redemption**. He shows how **Proverbs** presupposes Israel’s narrative, how **Job** interrogates retributive simplisms within the frame of divine sovereignty, and how **Ecclesiastes** exposes life under the sun as vanity unless interpreted through **eschatology**. The decisive move is to see **Christ** as the embodiment of **wisdom**. Thus, wisdom sayings are neither mere moralism nor alien to the **gospel**, but instruments of **sanctification** when refracted through **union with Christ**.

In **The Gospel in Revelation**, Goldsworthy works out a robust **apocalyptic** hermeneutic, privileging a **Christocentric** reading of symbols. The **Lamb** stands at the center; judgments are the outworking of the Lamb’s enthronement; the **new Jerusalem** is the perfected **temple**-people-place where **God dwells**. He resists newspaper eschatology and dispensational schemas, arguing that **Revelation** reiterates the **gospel** in visionary idiom and seals the now-not yet **kingdom**. The payoff is to stabilize **eschatology** within a **soteriological** frame and to anchor pastoral endurance in the already-secured victory of **Christ**.

#### 6. Preaching and catechesis: from exegesis to proclamation
Goldsworthy’s vocation aims at the **pulpit**. **Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture** offers a map for moving from exegesis of any text to **Christ-centered proclamation** without collapsing into allegory. He commends a pathway that traces a text to its **redemptive-historical** place, identifies typological connections to **Christ**, and then returns through **union with Christ** to the believer’s life. The three horizons are text-in-context, the whole-Canon centered on **gospel**, and the contemporary church under **Scripture**. He explicitly rejects moralizing and exemplarist sermons that bypass **Christology**, while equally rejecting a thin Christocentrism that merely name-checks Jesus. The point is to let each genre do its proper work within the **kingdom** economy: **law** to expose sin and guide life, **narrative** to recount saving acts, **prophecy** to call and promise, **wisdom** to shape the fear of the Lord, **apocalyptic** to unveil the Lamb’s reign.

Here, Goldsworthy’s pedagogy blends **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**. The **gospel** that interprets the Bible is the same gospel that creates and nourishes the **church**. By emphasizing **preaching** as proclamation of the **kingdom**, he aligns with the **Reformed** conviction that the **Word** is the ordinary means of grace and he supplies practical tools for training ministers worldwide. The influence of **Edmund Clowney** is evident, yet the Australian idiom remains: concise, kingdom-structured, pragmatic for parish life.

#### 7. Hermeneutical engagements and critiques: canon, promise, and history
Goldsworthy’s dialogues with other schools sharpen his profile. With **Brevard Childs**, he shares commitment to the **canonical** final form, yet he worries that canonical description without **gospel** norm risks flattening **typology** into literary echo. With **Walter Kaiser** and the **promise-plan**, he affirms promise-fulfillment, but contends that promise is embedded within a broader **kingdom** and **covenant** fabric and requires **Christological** fulfillment that often exceeds the expectations of original audiences. Against **James Barr**, who exposed the methodological naivete of earlier **biblical theology**, Goldsworthy embraces historical and literary rigor but denies the neutrality of method, insisting that the **gospel** supplies warranted theological presuppositions. He also debates **historical criticism** at the level of epistemology, not only conclusions, contending that a methodological bracketing of divine agency already misreads the **theopneustos** character of **Scripture**.

Internally, he cautions against proof-text **systematics** that abstract doctrines from **salvation-history** and against tunnel-vision exegesis that forgets the **church**’s rule of faith. His preferred mediation is a flow between **biblical theology** and **systematic theology**, in which dogmatics distills the **canonical** witness governed by the **gospel**, and exegesis is summoned to render texts as witnesses to **Christ**. In **Christ-Centered Biblical Theology** 2012 he proposes that themes like **temple**, **image**, and **sacrifice** converge in **Christology**, whose pattern is then normatively extended to **ecclesiology** and **ethics**. The point is not to replace dogmatics but to recalibrate its sources and shape.

#### 8. Doctrinal coordinates: revelation, covenant, and eschatology in a gospel frame
Doctrinally, Goldsworthy’s biblical theology stabilizes three coordinates: **revelation**, **covenant**, and **eschatology**. His doctrine of **revelation** is eventful and textual; God makes himself known in acts that are interpreted by inspired **Scripture**, whose unity is **Christ**. His **covenant** thinking is integrative rather than scholastic; the **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, **Davidic**, and **new** covenants are successive divine administrations oriented to the **kingdom** realized in **Christ**. He is less invested in constructing the classic **covenant of works** or the supra-temporal **pactum salutis**, though he affirms their soteriological substance in the **second Adam** motif. His **eschatology** is resolutely inaugurated: the kingdom is present in **Christ** and **Spirit**, yet consummation awaits the **parousia**. This now-not yet frame regulates **ethics** by grounding the church’s pilgrim status and shapes **sacramentology** implicitly in that the **church** is the people-place of God indwelt by the **Spirit** as a prolepsis of the **new creation**.

Within **soteriology**, the centrality of the **cross** and **resurrection** as the gospel’s content re-centers every doctrine, from **justification** and **adoption** to **sanctification** and **glorification**. Christ’s representative obedience and atoning death are not isolated loci but the hinge of the **kingdom** story. Ecclesially, the **Word** governs the **church**’s life, and mission is proclamation of the **kingdom** to the nations. Thus Goldsworthy’s biblical theology is a practical dogmatics for preaching: it delivers not only interpretive principles but doctrinal cohesion in a form usable by pastors.

#### 9. Influence and reception: the evangelical mainstream and Reformed alignment
The reach of **Goldsworthy** in the English-speaking world has been considerable. The **Goldsworthy Trilogy** became standard fare in **seminaries** and **evangelical** training colleges; **According to Plan** functions as a first introduction to **biblical theology**; **Preaching the Whole Bible as Christian Scripture** has shaped homiletics and **catechesis**; **Gospel-Centered Hermeneutics** resourced debates about **postmodern** interpretation and the limits of **historical criticism**. Within the **Reformed** world, especially the **Vosian** strand at Westminster and elsewhere, Goldsworthy’s kingdom schema and typology resonate with **Ridderbos** on the **kingdom**, **Clowney** on **preaching**, and the broader retrieval of **redemptive-historical** exegesis. Among Anglicans, his approach represents a distinctively **Sydney** pattern that centers the **gospel** and secures Scripture’s authority in parish ministry.

Yet the reception also yielded critiques. Some worry that a single master motif, the **kingdom of God**, risks marginalizing other architectonic categories such as **covenant** or **sacrifice** unless carefully integrated. Others note that by making the **gospel** the hermeneutical norm, there is a danger of circularity that requires dogmatic articulation of the **rule of faith** to avoid subjectivism. Goldsworthy anticipates this by locating the **gospel** in the apostolic **kerygma** and the canonical **Scripture**, but tensions remain about the precise relation between **biblical theology** and **systematic** norms. Even so, the core contribution stands: he offers ministers a reliable map for reading all Scripture as Christian Scripture in a way that is **Christological**, **ecclesial**, and **missionary**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: alignment and principled tensions
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Goldsworthy’s project aligns strongly with **Vosian redemptive-historical** method, **Clowney’s** Christ-centered preaching, and a covenantal reading of **Scripture** as one organic whole in **Christ**. His **typology**, inaugurated **eschatology**, and insistence that **revelation** is inherently **soteriological** are deeply consonant with classical **Reformed** commitments. Two principled tensions surface. First, the dominance of **kingdom** as architectonic category, while fruitful, can obscure the structural priority of **covenant** in **Reformed** federal thought, including the pedagogical value of the **covenant of works** and the eternal **pactum salutis** for articulating **law-gospel** relations and the active-passive obedience of **Christ**. A Westminster alternative would retain Goldsworthy’s salvation-historical line while placing the **covenant of grace** as the formal principle organizing **kingdom**, **typology**, and **sacramentology**. Second, making the **gospel** the hermeneutical norm is right in substance but should be supplemented by the **regula fidei** confessed in the **Reformed confessions**, lest Christocentrism drift into thematic selectivity. With these calibrations, Reformed theology can gladly appropriate Goldsworthy as a trusted guide whose **biblical theology** amplifies the confessional grammar of **creation**, **covenant**, **redemption**, and **consummation** under the sovereign grace of the triune **God**.
