### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and vocation
Henri Blocher, born in 1937 and formed amid the upheavals of **postwar Europe**, emerges as the preeminent French voice of the broad **evangelical** tradition, articulating a learned apologetic for **biblical revelation** within a secular and Catholic-majority France. Educated in both Francophone and Anglophone settings, he absorbed **Reformed** doctrinal instincts through exposure to **Calvin**, **Augustine**, and Anglophone evangelical theologians such as **B. B. Warfield** and **J. I. Packer**, even as he read widely in **Barth**, **Bultmann**, and **Ricoeur**. His long tenure at the **Faculté Libre de Théologie Évangélique** at Vaux-sur-Seine, with later appointments including the **Gunther Knoedler Professorship of Systematic Theology at Wheaton Graduate School**, positioned him to serve as a bridge-builder between the French academy and the evangelical world shaped by **Lausanne**. The historical context of **1960s–2000s European secularization**, the crisis of authority after 1968, and the rising profile of **evangelical missions** inform his insistence that **revelation** is both intellectually credible and ecclesially nourishing.

Blocher’s ecclesial and institutional commitments align with a global evangelical consolidation around **biblical authority**, evident in his support for the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978 and participation in **Lausanne** conversations on mission and truth. Yet his location in France demanded a supple engagement with **continental philosophy**, leading him to read **phenomenology**, **structuralism**, and **hermeneutics** not as masters but as tools ancillary to **theologia revelata**. The result is a theologian whose voice is at once recognizably **Reformed** in the Augustinian sense and dialogical with the late modern quest for meaning, a combination visible across works like **In the Beginning**, **Original Sin**, and **Evil and the Cross**.

#### 2. Method: revelation, reason, and hermeneutics
The axis of Blocher’s method is the conviction that **revelation** is God’s sovereign self-communication, manifest in the canonical **Scriptures** that bear authoritative witness without error in all they affirm. He rejects a sharp disjunction between **propositional revelation** and personal self-disclosure, arguing in an Augustinian and Calvinian register that the God who speaks is the God who gives himself, and that **verbum Dei** and **Spiritus Sanctus** are inseparable in the act of knowing. Against the **Barthian** suspicion of propositional form, he maintains that divine address has conceptual content, even as all saving knowledge remains **gratia supponit revelationem**. The hermeneutical rule is **analogia fidei**, Scripture interpreting Scripture within the **canonical** economy, yet he grants that literary form, genre, and discourse-worlds demand learned attention consistent with **grammatico-historical** exegesis.

Blocher’s epistemic stance is a chastened confidence, a kind of evangelical **fiducia** corrected by humility before the text and open to the light of **general revelation** under the norm of **special revelation**. He is conversant with **Ricoeur’s** theory of narrative and symbol, but he prosecutes a constant critique of any **hermeneutics of suspicion** that would sever text from referent, insisting that biblical **testimony** grounds real truth about God and the world. He employs the Latin rule that **sacra Scriptura sui ipsius interpres**, thereby resisting both historicist reduction and existentialist projection. This method becomes concrete in his reading of **Genesis**, in his construction of **original sin** in dialogue with **Romans 5**, and in his account of **atonement** as the divine answer to the enigma of evil.

#### 3. Creation, Genesis, and the literary framework
Blocher’s first major monograph, **In the Beginning: The Opening Chapters of Genesis** 1979 French, 1984 English, sets his canonical and hermeneutical commitments in motion. He contends that **Genesis 1–3** provides a true and foundational account of **creation**, **imago Dei**, and **the Fall**, while carefully arguing for a **literary framework** reading of the six days. The **framework** thesis maps the two triads of forming and filling as a highly structured proclamation of God’s sovereign artistry, without reducing the narrative to myth or allegory. This approach permits serious engagement with scientific accounts of cosmic history, including **old-earth** timescales, while insisting that the text’s theological affirmations are nonnegotiable: **creation ex nihilo**, divine **sovereignty**, the goodness of **nature**, the historicity of **Adam** as covenant head, and the entrance of **sin** through trespass.

In contest with both **scientific naturalism** and naive concordism, Blocher argues that Scripture neither teaches modern science nor lies about reality; it speaks in its own modes to declare the **ordo creationis**, within which human vocation and Sabbath rest find their telos. He critiques **process** and **panentheistic** accounts for diluting divine **aseity** and chastises **demythologizing** strategies for suppressing the radicality of **homo lapsus**. His carefully qualified openness to aspects of **evolutionary** explanation in the nonhuman realm is circumscribed by a firm defense of the **historical Adam**, which he regards as exegetically required by **Pauline** argumentation and soteriologically vital for **federal headship**. Here the **analogia fidei** constrains speculative harmonizations and anchors his appeal to **science** under the sufficiency of **Scripture**.

#### 4. Hamartiology: Augustinian realism and federal imputation
The heart of Blocher’s doctrinal oeuvre is **Original Sin: Illuminating the Riddle** 1997, a constructive essay on the **transmission** of sin, the justice of **imputation**, and the universality of human **depravity**. Rejecting both **Pelagianism** and the underdetermined **semi-Pelagian** drift, he aligns with **Augustine** in affirming that all humanity truly participates in Adam’s sin, yet he resists an unnuanced **realism** that would collapse individual agency into an ontological monism. Instead he proposes a **federal realism** in which **covenant headship** and ontic solidarity are inseparable, grounding the forensic imputation of **Adam’s** guilt in the reality of a divinely constituted human unity. Blocher argues that **Romans 5:12–21** demands both the juridical and ontological dimensions, for in Adam all sinned and are condemned, and in **Christ** the new Adam the righteous standing and life are given, a parallel that requires an objective headship in both cases.

On the phenomenological level, Blocher explores the tragic coherence of **concupiscence**, the social entanglement of **structures of sin**, and the individual will’s bondage, employing both **biblical theology** and careful philosophical analysis. He insists that the doctrine of **original sin** is a hermeneutic of reality, not a relic of medieval speculation, and that it alone accounts for the **universality** of evil without making God the author of sin. He dialogues critically with **Barth’s** reinterpretation of election and with **Moltmann’s** stress on suffering, concluding that without a robust Augustinian center the **gospel** dissolves into therapy. Yet he retains a note of biblical reserve, refusing to trespass beyond the **mysterium iniquitatis**, pleading for **dogmatic modesty** where Scripture is laconic while remaining dogmatically firm where Scripture is explicit.

#### 5. Evil and atonement: the cross as penal, victorious, and beautiful
In **Evil and the Cross: An Analytical Look at the Problem of Pain** 2004, Blocher addresses **theodicy** not by abstract speculation but by locating God’s answer in the **atonement** of **Christ**. He affirms the primacy of **penal substitution**, arguing from **Isaiah 53**, **Romans 3:21–26**, and **2 Corinthians 5:21** that divine justice is satisfied as the sinless substitute bears judgment, and he integrates this penal axis with **Christus Victor** triumph over the powers and an **exemplary** moral transformation. The cross, for Blocher, is the unity of justice and mercy, the dramatic center in which **divine holiness** and **grace** embrace, a synthesis he sets against both **process theism** and **Girardian** mimetic reductionism.

Blocher’s analytic posture shines in his handling of logical puzzles about **divine impassibility**, **simplicity**, and **satisfaction**. He carefully distinguishes between **pathos** metaphorically predicated and divine **immutability** properly confessed, arguing that the God who does not change nevertheless freely wills to endure the contradiction of sin in the **Son’s** assumed humanity. He appropriates the **classical** confession of **divine simplicity** and **aseity** while refusing to cloak suffering in euphemism, and he concludes that the cross is the only theodicy that truly deserves the name. In this he displays loyalty to **Reformed orthodoxy** joined to ecumenical catholicity.

#### 6. Revelation, Scripture, and authority in a secular age
Across essays and lectures clustered around the debates of the 1970s and 1980s, Blocher contends for the **inspiration** and **inerrancy** of Scripture as the living **Word of God**. He aligns with the **Chicago Statement**, not as a last-ditch defense but as a positive articulation of how a truth-telling God communicates through human authors without falsehood. A hallmark of his argument is the integration of **propositional truth** and **personal address**: revelation is cognitive and covenantal, testifying to the God who makes himself known. He calls this the **unity of the Word and Spirit**, refusing any bifurcation that would reduce doctrine to community practice or collapse truth into **interpretive voluntarism**.

Methodologically, he deploys a thick **grammatico-historical** reading while attending to the various literary forms of **Scripture**, calling for a canonical sensibility that resists atomization. He takes **Ricoeur** seriously on symbol and narrative but insists that the **res** of the text is not exhausted by its rhetorical effect. Blocher is therefore a key evangelical voice against **postmodern** constructivism and against **historicist** dissolution of doctrine, arguing for a chastened but real **natural theology** in concert with **Romans 1**, subordinated to **special revelation**. This balance allows him to converse fruitfully with European scholars while offering a confident account of **Christian truth** for the church.

#### 7. Ecclesial mission and the evangelical mind
Blocher’s participation in the **Lausanne Movement** and leadership among the **Fellowship of European Evangelical Theologians** demonstrate his conviction that theology serves **mission** and **discipleship**. He sees doctrinal integrity as missional clarity, arguing that the church’s witness collapses when **revelation** is attenuated or **atonement** redefined. Against a backdrop of European disestablishment and intellectual suspicion, he models how evangelical theology can be genuinely **learned**, patient with opponents, and at the same time unapologetically **confessional**. His bilingual work disseminated **Anglo-Reformed** insights into the Francophone world while sharpening evangelical self-understanding about **creation**, **sin**, and **grace**.

He sought a constructive evangelical **catholicity** that remembers the riches of **patristic** and **Reformation** theology, resisting both sectarianism and assimilation. For Blocher, the **rule of faith** and the **analogia fidei** guide doctrine, while exegetical labor and philosophical clarity fertilize it. In this integrated vision, theology is not an academic hobby but a service of **the Word** that equips the church to confess **Christ** in the university, the marketplace, and the margins.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and abiding contribution
Throughout his career, Blocher negotiated between **Barthian** dialectic, **liberal Protestant** historicism, and **Roman Catholic** ressourcement, retrieving **Augustine** and **Calvin** while engaging **Pannenberg** on history and **Moltmann** on hope. With **Barth**, he shares a zeal for God’s freedom and primacy, yet he resists Barth’s reticence about **propositional revelation** and insists on **inerrancy**. Against **Bultmann**, he refuses **demythologizing**, and with **Ricoeur** he learns to respect symbol without surrendering **referential truth**. His polemical energy is most focused in the defense of **historical Adam**, the coherence of **imputation**, and the nonnegotiable **penal** dimension of the cross, all grounded in a canonical, evangelical reading of Scripture.

The abiding contribution is an intellectually responsible, continental evangelical **systematics** that coheres around **revelation**, **creation**, **sin**, and **atonement**, set within a chastened but confident engagement with **science** and the humanities. His work is a model of how broad evangelicalism can be both **Reformed** in soteriological core and dialogical in method, without capitulation to the reigning paradigms of the academy. That synthesis has equipped pastors, students, and scholars across Europe and North America to articulate **Christian doctrine** with clarity and courage.

Final Reformed/WTS evaluation. From a **Westminster** vantage, Blocher is a welcome ally on **inerrancy**, **Augustinian hamartiology**, **historical Adam**, and **penal substitution**, and on the **analogia fidei**. Questions arise where his **literary framework** and openness to **old-earth** science can be misused to blunt the historical sequence and Sabbath pattern of **Genesis 1**, where a more Van Tilian emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction** might sharpen antithesis with **autonomous reason**. His qualified affirmation of **natural theology** invites careful boundary-setting to avoid weakening a presuppositional critique of **epistemic autonomy**. Some will ask whether his balancing of **federal imputation** with ontic solidarity risks diluting the forensic clarity prized in **Reformed orthodoxy**, though he explicitly maintains imputation’s primacy. Still, in principle his project aligns with classical **covenantal** commitments: **revelation** norms philosophy, **grace** restores nature without erasing creation, and **history** is the theater of the triune God’s saving acts centered in **Christ**. The alternative within Reformed orthodoxy is not to reject Blocher’s synthesis but to reinforce it by tightening metaphysical guards on **divine aseity**, pushing harder on **antithesis** in epistemology, and maintaining the confessional texture of **Sabbath** and **providence** alongside his exemplary biblical-theological craft.
