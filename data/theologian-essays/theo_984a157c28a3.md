### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Darrell L. Bock emerges from the institutional nexus of **Dallas Theological Seminary** and the British New Testament guild, completing doctoral work at the **University of Aberdeen** under **I. Howard Marshall** in the early 1980s while returning to teach in a DTS milieu marked by classic and then **progressive dispensationalism**. The historical setting is decisive: the rise of the **Jesus Seminar**, the consolidation of evangelical scholarship in the **Society of Biblical Literature**, and the renaissance of **Second Temple Judaism** studies shaped Bock’s programmatic claim that **Luke–Acts** functions as a robust theological witness that can stand in the marketplace of historical inquiry. In this context he positioned himself as a mediator, insisting that the **Gospels** are historically serious sources while maintaining confessional commitments to **Christology**, **canon**, and the mission of the **church**.

Bock’s method is anchored in **historical-grammatical exegesis** enriched by **Second Temple** background, with a self-described **critical realism** that seeks public reasons for historical claims and theological coherence ad intra. He is explicit that grammatical detail, discourse structure, and intertextual echoes, especially to the **Septuagint** and to **Daniel 7** and **Psalm 110**, must govern readings of the **Son of Man** and **kyrios** titles. He uses the standard **criteria of authenticity** but in chastened form, subordinating them to narrative coherence and multiple attestation across **Synoptic** and **Johannine** trajectories. The result is a bidirectional hermeneutic that moves from **history to theology** and from **theology to history**, insisting that the *Wirkungsgeschichte* of the church’s confession does not negate but rather clarifies the earliest **Christological** claims.

An abiding emphasis falls on **Luke–Acts** as a single narrative of **salvation history**, in which the **kingdom of God** is **already–not yet**, the **Spirit** animates mission, and the **Davidic** promises are reframed around the exalted **Messiah**. Bock’s Aberdeen formation under **Marshall** and in conversation with **F. F. Bruce** gave him a preference for historically thick, theologically modest claims that cumulatively amount to a robust **early high Christology**, a phrase later sharpened through dialogue with **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham**. His pedagogical posture at DTS and his public work at the **Hendricks Center** display an evangelical confidence that **Scripture** is both historically anchored and theologically normative.

#### 2. Lucan Christology by prophecy and pattern
Bock’s early monograph **Proclamation from Prophecy and Pattern: Lucan Old Testament Christology** 1987 set a trajectory by arguing that **Luke–Acts** integrates two modes of biblical reasoning: explicit **prophecy-fulfillment** and implicit **pattern-typology**. He claims that Luke’s use of the **LXX** constructs a *sensus plenior* that is not eisegetical but rooted in canonical trajectories, so that **Davidic**, **Exodus**, and **Isaiah** motifs converge in the identity of Jesus as **Messiah** and **Lord**. The methodological payoff is a disciplined account of **intertextuality** where quotations and allusions operate within Luke’s macrostructure, preparing Bock to contend that Lucan **Christology** is not late dogmatic overlay but an early, intrinsically Jewish construal of Jesus’ identity.

In his two-volume **Luke** commentary in the **Baker Exegetical Commentary on the New Testament** 1994, 1996, Bock extends this thesis by close analysis of the infancy narratives, the programmatic Nazareth sermon, and the travel narrative. Key nodes are **Luke 4** as jubilean charter, **Luke 7** as prophetic authentication, and **Luke 22** as sovereignty through suffering. He consistently reads **kyrios** in Luke as a messianic title shading into divine prerogative when set against **Second Temple** monotheistic boundaries, particularly in scenes involving **forgiveness of sins**, **Sabbath lordship**, and authority over **demons**. Throughout, Bock frames the **kingdom of God** as inaugurated in Jesus’ ministry and extended through **Acts**, thereby underwriting his later **progressive dispensational** account of present and future reign.

#### 3. Acts, Spirit, and the shape of inaugurated reign
The **Acts** volume in **BECNT** 2007 crystallizes Bock’s reading of **exaltation** and **Spirit** as the hinge of New Testament theology. Acts 2, with its **Psalm 110** and **Joel** catena, becomes for Bock the formal enthronement of Jesus as **Lord** at God’s right hand, evidencing an **already** realization of **Davidic** promises that awaits an **eschatological** consummation. Here Bock is in extended dialogue with **G. K. Beale**, **C. K. Barrett**, and **N. T. Wright** on temple and kingship themes, and he develops a nuanced line: the **new covenant** and **Spirit** are fully present, the **mission to the nations** is theologically mandated, and yet certain **land** and **national** dimensions remain prospective, a stance that will harden into his **progressive dispensationalism**.

In **A Theology of Luke and Acts** 2012 Bock synthesizes these exegetical labors into a canonical portrait. The controlling categories are **God’s plan** (*boule tou theou*), **Christology** as exaltation unto shared divine prerogatives, **pneumatology** as empowerment for witness, **soteriology** as forgiveness and reconciliation, and **ecclesiology** as a multiethnic people under the **kingdom**. Bock’s emphasis on narrative unity allows him to argue that the same **Lordship** confessed in Luke’s infancy hymns is ratified by **resurrection** and **ascension**, grounding the church’s identity and ethics. He defends the **already–not yet** tension by returning to **Acts 15**, arguing that the **Amos 9** citation signals the rebuilding of **David’s fallen tent** in a manner inclusive of Gentiles now, without negating Israel’s future hope.

#### 4. The historical Jesus, early high Christology, and the blasphemy charge
Bock’s contributions to **historical Jesus** studies seek to rebut the dichotomy of Jesus of history and **Christ of faith**. In **Studying the Historical Jesus** 2002 and **Jesus According to Scripture** 2002, rev. 2017, he canvasses sources, methods, and the synoptic tradition, proposing that a realistic use of **criteria of authenticity** confirms a Jesus who self-consciously enacted divine authority. He confronts **Bart Ehrman**, **John Dominic Crossan**, and **Marcus Borg**, showing that their reconstructions misread Jewish categories and underestimate the coherence of gospel tradition. The core argument is that Jesus claimed roles and performed actions that, within **Second Temple** monotheism, were reserved for God, thereby grounding an **early high Christology**.

The focal monograph **Blasphemy and Exaltation in Judaism: The Charge Against Jesus in Mark 14:64** 1998, with expanded 2000 release, advances this point by analyzing the Jewish legal and cultural matrix of **blasphemy**. Bock contends that in **Mark 14:62** Jesus’ fusion of **Daniel 7**’s **Son of Man** and **Psalm 110**’s **right-hand** enthronement signals a claim to heavenly authority and future judgment, which the high priest construed as an encroachment on divine prerogative. In dialogue with **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham**, Bock locates the blasphemy charge not in syllable-level divine self-claiming but in a functional inclusion of Jesus within the divine identity, ratified by the **resurrection**. His thesis preserves Jewish scruples and explains the early worship of Jesus as **Lord** without positing late metaphysical development alien to Jewish thought.

#### 5. Canon, orthodoxy, and public apologetics
Responding to popular skepticism, Bock wrote **Breaking the Da Vinci Code** 2004, **The Missing Gospels** 2006, and with **Daniel B. Wallace** coauthored **Dethroning Jesus** 2007, addressing claims about **Gnostic** texts, **canon formation**, and textual variation. The apologetic strategy is consistent with his academic method: place **Nag Hammadi** literature within its second-century context, clarify the rule of **apostolicity** and **orthodoxy**, and show that **textual criticism** does not imperil core **Christological** claims. Against **Ehrman**-style textual skepticism, Bock insists that the stability of the **Greek** tradition yields a trustworthy Jesus portrait. The broader theological impulse is ecclesial: the church’s confession is narratively and historically rooted, not a late **Verkündigung** that merely projects faith onto a silent past.

Bock’s public work at the **Hendricks Center** and through **The Table** podcast expands these commitments into cultural theology. Books like **Cultural Intelligence** 2020 translate **kingdom** and **mission** categories into practices for pluralist engagement, drawing on **Acts** for models of persuasion and civic presence. While not a formal systematician, Bock’s canon-and-culture program exhibits an evangelical **missional ecclesiology** keyed to **truth claims** that can be rendered publicly without abandoning **confessional** depth.

#### 6. Progressive dispensationalism and the shape of fulfillment
In collaboration with **Craig A. Blaising**, Bock helped formulate **progressive dispensationalism** in **Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church** 1992 and the programmatic **Progressive Dispensationalism** 1993. The school’s signature theses are **complementary hermeneutics** and **inaugurated eschatology**: texts may receive a later, complementary fulfillment consistent with but extending beyond their initial horizon, and the **Davidic** and **new covenant** promises are inaugurated at Christ’s **ascension** and **Pentecost** while awaiting consummation. Bock thus maintains a qualified **Israel–church** distinction grounded in biblical covenants, yet rejects the strict bifurcations of classic **dispensationalism**. Key exegetical linchpins include **Acts 2** as enthronement, **Luke 1–2** for Davidic expectation, and **Romans 11** for the future of **Israel**.

Theologically, Bock’s progressive stance claims to honor both canonical unity and textual specificity. He argues that **typology** does not erase the native voice of **Zion**, **land**, and **people**, even as Christ universalizes the scope of promise. His discussion of **new covenant** presence underscores sacrificial fulfillment and **Spirit** endowment while remaining open to eschatological restoration motifs. Interlocutors include **Robert L. Saucy**, supportive yet occasionally divergent, and **Walter C. Kaiser Jr.**, whose promise-plan model overlaps Bock’s but differs in hermeneutical emphasis. Throughout, Bock seeks a via media between **covenant theology** and classic dispensationalism, appealing to the already–not yet logic shared with **Ridderbos** and **Wright**.

#### 7. Doctrinal texture: Christology, kingdom, Spirit, and mission
Across his corpus Bock’s doctrinal emphases cohere. His **Christology** is fundamentally **exaltation**-centered, arguing that Jesus’ identity is disclosed in actions and prerogatives that, in a Jewish framework, imply participation in the divine **identity**, culminating in **resurrection** and **ascension**. His **kingdom of God** theology is resolutely **inaugurated**, anchored in **Luke 4** and **Acts 2**, connecting forgiveness, social concern, and mission under the reign of the exalted **Lord**. His **pneumatology** foregrounds the **Spirit** as the empowering presence of the new age, forming a community whose life is both charismatic and ethical. His **missiology** takes **Acts** as programmatic: public proclamation, reasoned defense, and contextual sensitivity in the **Areopagus** and synagogue alike.

On **Scripture**, Bock models a high **inerrancy** posture without retreating from critical engagement, holding that the **canonical** form is theologically normative while the **historical** process of tradition and redaction is instrumentally revelatory. He pursues an **analogia Scripturae** hermeneutic functionally aligned with evangelical **sola Scriptura**, though he supplements it with **Second Temple** comparative data and the disciplined use of **authenticity criteria**. While metaphysical doctrines like **divine simplicity** or **Trinitarian** processions are not his focus, his exegetical claims about Jesus’ share in **YHWH’s** prerogatives furnish raw material for systematic articulation of **homoousios** in a thick Jewish frame.

#### 8. Interlocutors and developments
Bock’s conversation partners help locate his contribution. With **I. Howard Marshall**, he shares a narrative-theological orientation in **Luke–Acts** and a commitment to **New Testament** fidelity. With **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham**, he presses **early high Christology**, though he nuances their cultic worship emphasis with legal-cultural analysis of **blasphemy** in **Mark 14**. In debate with **Ehrman** and **Crossan**, he defends the stability of the **Gospel** tradition and rebuts reductionist **apocryphal** appeal. He appreciates **N. T. Wright’s** eschatological and kingdom emphases while resisting ecclesiological or covenantal collapses of **Israel** into the **church**. With **Craig Blomberg**, **Craig A. Evans**, and **Craig Keener**, he shares an evidential yet confessional posture that aims to persuade the academy and serve the **church**.

The trajectory is developmental but consistent. Early work on **prophecy and pattern** grounds a career-long insistence that **Scripture** interprets Scripture in historically precise ways. Mid-career monographs and commentaries sharpen a case for **exaltation Christology** and the inaugurated **kingdom**. Public apologetics expand the frame to **canon** and culture. The **progressive dispensational** synthesis, while debated, reflects a principled attempt to integrate **biblical theology** with covenantal particularities across **Luke–Acts** and **Paul**. The whole functions as a systematic proposal by accumulation: a hermeneutic, a Christology, an eschatology, and a missional ecclesiology bound together by a Lucan spine.

#### 9. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Bock’s corpus commends several strengths and raises principled tensions. Positively, his **inaugurated eschatology** tracks with **Vos** and **Ridderbos** on the two-age schema and the present reign of Christ, his **Luke–Acts** concentration strengthens **biblical theology**, and his defense of **early high Christology** fortifies confessional claims about the **person of Christ**. His careful appeal to **Second Temple** monotheism and to **Psalm 110** enthronement aligns with **covenant of grace** commitments that see Jesus as the telos of promise. Yet the **progressive dispensational** retention of an ongoing **Israel–church** duality, even qualified, strains the Reformed conviction that the **one covenant of grace** unfolds through typological fulfillment so that land and nation are recapitulated in Christ and his **church**. Where Bock invokes **complementary hermeneutics** to allow future national fulfillments, the Reformed prefer an intensified **analogia fidei** and robust **typology** that sees the **Davidic** and **new covenant** wholly realized in the person and work of the **Mediator** and sacramentally administered to the one people of God. Methodologically, his moderated use of **criteria of authenticity** is serviceable for public argument, but a **presuppositional** stance would urge a deeper acknowledgment that the authority of **revelation** grounds and normatively interprets the historical record rather than merely passing its tests. In sum, Reformed theology can gladly receive Bock’s exegetical case for exalted **Christology** and **kingdom** now, while proposing covenantal unification in place of residual dual structures and privileging **redemptive-historical** typology over complementary fulfillments.
