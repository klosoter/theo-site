### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Sam Storms emerged as a pastor theologian within late twentieth century **evangelicalism**, educated at **Dallas Theological Seminary** with a Th.M. completed in 1977 and later earning a Ph.D. in intellectual history at the **University of Texas at Dallas** in 1984. His early formation within **dispensationalism** gave way to a gradual embrace of **Calvinist soteriology** and eventually **amillennialism**, a migration emblematic of the currents that fed the **New Calvinism**. He served in pastorates across Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas City, taught theology at **Wheaton College** in the early 2000s, founded **Enjoying God Ministries** around 2000, and from 2008 to 2022 led **Bridgeway Church** in Oklahoma City. This vocational arc situates him at the crossroads of **charismatic renewal** and confessional **Reformed** convictions, a convergence he names and advances through the twin anchors of **Word and Spirit**.

Storms self-consciously elaborates a methodological synthesis that protects **sola Scriptura** while welcoming **continuationism**. Scripture remains the final norm for doctrine and discernment, yet the risen Christ still distributes **charismata** for the edification of the church, an integration governed by **Edwardsian affections** and an **already and not yet** reading of the Kingdom. His theological posture is pastoral, expository, and affective, shaped by **Jonathan Edwards** on the nature of true religion, by **John Piper** on **Christian Hedonism**, and by **Wayne Grudem** on **fallible prophecy**. The result is a hermeneutic that insists on the primacy of exegesis, especially of texts such as 1 Corinthians 12 to 14 and Ephesians 4, while encouraging disciplined openness to the Spirit’s present work under the canonical sufficiency of the **biblical** Word.

#### 2. Joy, affections, and the Christian life
If there is a leitmotif in Storms’s corpus, it is the summons to delight in God. In **The Singing God**, 1994 rev. 2013, **Pleasures Evermore**, 2002, and **One Thing**, 2004, he articulates a theology of joy indebted to **Christian Hedonism** and anchored in **Edwards’s religious affections**. The triune God, sovereign and self-sufficient, invites the redeemed into a life where the pursuit of maximal pleasure terminates in the enjoyment of divine glory. Storms argues that evangelical piety must be reconceived around the grammar of **affections** rather than bare volition, a move he grounds exegetically in Psalms, John, and Paul, and theologically in the beauty of **Christ** as the object of sanctified desire. He contends that proper doxology is not optional but constitutive of the **ordo salutis**, serving both as evidence of regeneration and as the telos of sanctification.

This affective orientation is not sentimentalism but a disciplined spirituality that incorporates **means of grace** and ecclesial accountability. In **J. I. Packer on the Christian Life**, 2015, Storms commends a sober, Puritan-inflected piety in which deep joy is wed to sober holiness, integrating **communion with God** and obedience to **Scripture**. He thereby holds together contemplative devotion and doctrinal clarity, showing how **divine sovereignty** fuels assurance and how **union with Christ** structures the believer’s life of faith, hope, and love. The implication for pastoral ministry is clear. Preaching aims at the transformation of the heart’s affections by the truth of the gospel, a thesis Storms shares with **Edwards** and **Piper** yet adapts for a church committed to **charismatic** vitality.

#### 3. Soteriology and assurance
Storms’s soteriological center is uncompromisingly **Reformed**. In **Chosen for Life**, 1997 rev. 2007, he defends **unconditional election** and **effectual calling**, commending a compatibilist account of human freedom within **divine sovereignty**. He expounds Romans 8 to 9, Ephesians 1, and John 6 to argue that salvation’s initiative rests in God alone, that faith is God’s gift, and that predestination grounds assurance without annihilating human responsibility. His polemical dialogue targets **Arminianism** and **Open Theism**, yet he strives for pastoral tone, framing election as a doctrine of comfort rather than controversy. Storms couples this with a robust doctrine of perseverance in **Kept for Jesus**, 2015, where he addresses the **assurance of salvation** by threading the needle between antinomian security and anxious moralism. He affirms that those united to Christ by Spirit-wrought faith will be kept, while warning that nominal profession without **sanctification** does not save.

Storms’s soteriology is cross-shaped. In **A Dozen Things God Did With Your Sin**, 2021, he catalogs the finished dimensions of the atonement, stressing **penal substitution**, **propitiation**, **reconciliation**, and **expiation** as objective accomplishments that secure the believer’s standing. He emphasizes the definitive break with sin and the gift of the Spirit as the down payment of the **age to come**, weaving **already and not yet** eschatology into the subjective appropriation of the gospel. The pastoral yield is twofold. First, doctrinal clarity on **justification** and **adoption** stabilizes the conscience. Second, confidence in Christ’s sufficiency liberates the affections for joyful obedience, cohering with the broader **Christian Hedonist** frame.

#### 4. Edwardsian discernment of the Spirit
Storms’s most distinctive theological retrieval is his appropriation of **Jonathan Edwards** for charismatic discernment. In **Signs of the Spirit**, 2007, he provides a lucid distillation of **Religious Affections** and **A Faithful Narrative**, arguing that true spirituality is measured not by intensity of experience but by the Spirit’s production of **holy affections** focused on the glory of **Christ** and conformity to **Scripture**. He rehearses Edwards’s negative signs, such as bodily effects or sudden impulses, as insufficient to authenticate grace, and positive signs, such as a new relish for divine beauty and a deepening love for holiness, as the reliable marks of the Spirit’s work. The retrieval is strategic. It furnishes **charismatic** practice with a theologically rigorous standard that resists **enthusiasm** and opportunism.

Deployed within charismatic contexts, this **Edwardsian** grid becomes a tool for congregational testing of **prophecy**, **healing**, and putative revival. Storms insists that all operations attributed to the Spirit be tried by the canon, that corporate leadership exercise sober judgment, and that spiritual experiences be situated within a life of obedience and service. He thereby reframes the debate over **continuationism** as a question of sanctified perception under the Word, rather than a pursuit of the sensational. The pattern is classic **Puritan** spirituality applied to the contemporary **charismatic** scene, a tight weave of doctrinal orthodoxy and experiential godliness.

#### 5. Pneumatology, gifts, and ecclesial practice
Storms’s ecclesial program comes into focus in **The Beginner’s Guide to Spiritual Gifts**, 2002 rev. 2013, **Understanding Spiritual Gifts**, 2020, **The Language of Heaven**, 2019, and **Practicing the Power**, 2017. He commends **continuationism** with guardrails. New covenant **prophecy** is real yet **fallible**, an impression or revelation that must be weighed by Scripture and the church, never bearing canonical authority. **Tongues** are a gift for prayer and praise, either human or heavenly language, and should be interpreted in gathered worship. **Healing** is sought through prayer and submission to God’s will, rejecting both skepticism and triumphalism. He reads 1 Corinthians 12 to 14 as regulative for contemporary practice, contending that **Ephesians 2.20** does not preclude ongoing prophetic ministries that lack the foundational, inscripturating authority of the **apostles and prophets**.

Storms’s debates on gifts engage **B. B. Warfield** on **Counterfeit Miracles** and **John MacArthur** on the **Strange Fire** thesis of 2013. He grants the reality of abuses and the necessity of discipline, yet maintains that abolishing the gifts overcorrects the problem. He also dialogues with **Tom Schreiner** and other cessationist exegetes, pressing grammatical and redemptive-historical readings that keep **Acts** descriptive yet paradigmatic and that preserve the **ordinary means of grace** while welcoming the Spirit’s **extraordinary** help. Practically, at **Bridgeway Church**, Storms cultivated teams for prophecy and healing, established protocols for testing words, disciplined false claims, and required pastoral oversight, aiming to embody an ordered **Word and Spirit** liturgy that honors both **sola Scriptura** and the Spirit’s freedom.

#### 6. Eschatology and the shape of hope
In **Kingdom Come**, 2013, Storms offers a sustained case for **amillennialism** against both **dispensational** and **historic premillennialism**. He reads Revelation through the lens of **recapitulation**, interpreting Revelation 20 as a symbolic portrait of the present inter-advental reign of Christ and the binding of Satan that restricts his deception regarding the nations. His hermeneutic is typological and covenantal, aligning with **Reformed** biblical theology in which Old Testament land, temple, and throne promises are fulfilled in **Christ** and his church. The **already and not yet** of the Kingdom renders mission urgent, suffering normative, and hope certain, without positing a terrestrial millennial interregnum.

Storms situates his eschatology pastorally. The church’s vocation is to witness in weakness, to endure tribulation, and to anticipate the consummation at Christ’s return, when resurrection, judgment, and new creation arrive together. He contends that this eschatological frame supports a sane **continuationism**, since the gifts function as foretastes of the **age to come** and as instruments of mission, not as guarantees of cultural dominion. The implications radiate into preaching, sacraments, and ecclesial endurance, calling the church to patient faithfulness rather than speculative timelines. In this vision, **amillennialism** stabilizes the affective life of believers by uniting longing, lament, and joy under the lordship of the risen **Christ**.

#### 7. Moral theology, culture, and tough questions
Storms addresses contested doctrinal and ethical matters with a pastoral apologetic in **Tough Topics**, 2013, and the follow-up volume in 2015. He treats issues such as **divine sovereignty and evil**, **hell and judgment**, **the unpardonable sin**, **spiritual warfare**, and **gender complementarianism**, combining brisk exegesis with catechetical clarity. He argues that **penal substitution** is biblically necessary, that **eternal conscious punishment** is warranted by Scripture and divine justice, and that **complementarian** patterns for church and home accord with apostolic teaching. On **spiritual warfare**, he acknowledges demonic oppression, advocates prayer and deliverance, and warns against sensationalism, a posture consistent with his broader **continuationist** prudence.

In cultural engagement he is decidedly evangelical and catholic in instinct. He prioritizes the church’s holiness and worship, aligns with networks like **Desiring God** and **The Gospel Coalition**, and emphasizes catechesis over culture war. His counsel is that deepening delight in **God** is the strongest bulwark against both secular despair and religious formalism. This alignment of moral theology with **affections** foregrounds the internal logic that runs from **divine beauty** to ethical integrity, a logic that reflects **Edwards** as much as it reflects the robust assurance of **Reformed** soteriology.

#### 8. Style, networks, and pastoral imprint
Storms writes as a pastor academic, a voice trained by **Reformed** dogmatics and shaped by **charismatic** practice. His style is clear and irenic, with frequent appeals to **Jonathan Edwards**, **John Piper**, and **Wayne Grudem**, and careful engagement with critics such as **John MacArthur** and **B. B. Warfield**. The consistent throughline is the insistence that doctrine is for doxology and discipleship, that **sola Scriptura** and spiritual power are friends, and that the church’s vitality requires both theological depth and openness to the Spirit’s gifts. His long tenure at **Bridgeway Church** functioned as a laboratory for this vision, where protocols for **prophecy**, intercessory prayer for **healing**, and catechesis in **Calvinist soteriology** were braided into congregational life.

Theologically, this **convergence** aims to repair a breach in evangelical memory. The God who elects and justifies also empowers and speaks, though never in a way that competes with the **canon**. The Christ who reigns now, per **amillennialism**, also equips the saints with gifts suited to their era between the times. The Spirit who grants **assurance of salvation** also awakens **holy affections**, securing a life ordered around the joy of **God**. This integrative pitch explains Storms’s influence among younger pastors seeking a credible **Pentecostal** energy without letting go of **Reformed** orthodoxy.

#### 9. A single integrated Reformed or WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Seminary vantage, Storms’s project displays real strengths and clear points of tension. Strengths include a robust account of **unconditional election**, a pastoral doctrine of **assurance**, a clear defense of **penal substitution**, and a biblically reasoned **amillennialism** that aligns with covenantal hermeneutics. His **Edwardsian affections** correct moralism and his **Christian Hedonism** places doxology at the heart of discipleship, themes consonant with Reformed piety. The tensions arise chiefly in his **continuationism**, especially the thesis of **fallible prophecy** alongside **sola Scriptura**. Westminster Confession 1.1 affirms that former ways of God’s revealing his will have ceased, and many in the **Westminster** tradition locate **extraordinary gifts** within the once-for-all **foundation of apostles and prophets**, Ephesians 2.20, linking miracle clusters to **historia salutis** rather than to the ongoing **ordo salutis**. Storms seeks to resolve this by defining congregational prophecy as noncanonical and by erecting testing protocols, yet some will judge that the regulative principle and the sufficiency of Scripture are more cleanly preserved by cessationist prudence, grounding the church’s vitality in the **ordinary means of grace** and the Spirit’s inward illumination. A Reformed alternative would affirm the Spirit’s powerful presence in preaching, prayer, and sacrament, acknowledge providential healings without designating them as gifts in the technical sense, and read the New Testament’s gift lists as tied to the era of canonical foundation. Still, Storms’s charitable tone and exegetical seriousness model a way to dispute without rancor, and his emphasis on **joy in God** is a salutary counter to arid confessionalism, even where the practice of **charismata** remains contested.
