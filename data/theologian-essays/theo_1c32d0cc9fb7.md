### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the analytic-progressive stance
John Schneider emerges from the American evangelical and Reformed academic world at **Calvin University**, shaped by the same late twentieth-century resurgence of **analytic philosophy of religion** associated with figures like **Alvin Plantinga** and **Nicholas Wolterstorff**. That revival prized argumentative clarity, modal analysis, and careful attention to doctrines such as **providence**, **creation**, and the **problem of evil**. Schneider trained as a philosopher-theologian and inhabited a confessional space where **Augustinian** soteriology, **Calvinist** doctrines of grace, and a high view of **Scripture** were taken for granted, even as the faculty engaged contemporary philosophy and science. The first decade of the twenty-first century brought widening evangelical disputes over **evolution**, the historical **Adam**, and **original sin**, catalyzed by the **BioLogos** initiative and new genomic data. Schneider’s work crystallized in this crucible: he sought a progressive theological response faithful to Christian theism yet unembarrassed by modern evolutionary science, producing a project that ranges from economic ethics to the **Darwinian problem of evil** and a reconfiguration of the **Fall**.

Methodologically, Schneider is a practitioner of **analytic theology** joined to **theological aesthetics** and a form of **perfect-being theism** that reasons from God’s unsurpassable goodness to the shape of divine action. He treats **empirical science** as a privileged description of God’s world under **common grace**, affords **Scripture** authority through genre-sensitive **ANE hermeneutics**, and addresses evil through both **defense** and constructive **theodicy**. His stance is progressive in the sense that he is willing to revise traditional readings of **Genesis 1–3**, **Romans 5**, and **original sin** in light of evolutionary history, while preserving a robust **Christocentric** and eschatological horizon. The result is an unusually synthetic effort to integrate **evolutionary creation**, **animal suffering**, **wealth and virtue**, and **eschatological hope** under a single vision of the **goodness of God**.

#### 2. Affluence and ordered loves: The Good of Affluence (2002)
Schneider’s early signature contribution, **The Good of Affluence** (2002), addressed the ethics of wealth in a globalizing, market-driven world. Against ascetic readings of the **Sermon on the Mount** and activist critiques like **Ronald Sider’s** Rich Christians in an Age of Hunger, Schneider offered a carefully argued claim that material prosperity can be an authentic good of creation ordered to **shalom** within a framework of **Augustinian ordered loves**. He reads the biblical canon with attention to **creation** and **kingdom** themes, arguing that goods such as art, commerce, and technological culture can bear witness to **God’s generosity** when subordinated to **justice** and neighbor love. The book’s thesis is not prosperity gospel but a theologically governed affirmation of **affluence** as an instrumental good, chastened by the call to **preferential concern for the poor** and shaped by **virtue** rather than legalistic maximalism.

Philosophically, the work exhibits foundational elements of Schneider’s method: thick description of social realities, attention to **teleology**, and a refusal to treat desire as inherently corrupt under **Augustinian** pessimism. He contrasts **greed** as disordered love with **stewardship** as rightly ordered love, and proposes institutional responsibilities that align with **Nicholas Wolterstorff’s** account of justice and rights. While not yet preoccupied with **evolutionary theodicy**, the book foreshadows Schneider’s central wager: apparent tensions between modern life and Christian doctrine can be reconciled through an expansive account of **creation’s goodness**, judged by a **Christocentric** telos and not by nostalgic appeals to an imagined prelapsarian simplicity.

#### 3. The Darwinian problem of evil and analytic theodicy
By the late 2000s Schneider had turned decisively to the problem raised by **evolutionary biology**, namely the vast history of **animal suffering** and predation long before human emergence. This **Darwinian problem of evil** intensifies **William Rowe’s** evidential argument by removing human sin as a cause of nonmoral pain across deep time. If a good God is **omnipotent** and **omniscient**, why the millions of years of parasitism, famine, and extinction in the biosphere? Schneider enters this debate with the conceptual tools of **analytic theism** and the pastoral urgency shared with **Marilyn McCord Adams** on horrendous evils, while also learning from **Christopher Southgate’s** evolutionary theodicy and **John Hick’s** soul-making paradigm. He accepts the empirical reality of natural history as nonnegotiable and resists any appeal to a literal, deathless **Eden** toppled by a primordial **Fall** that could account for prehuman suffering.

In sharpening the problem, Schneider distinguishes between minimal **defenses** that seek logical consistency and richer **theodicies** that narrate divine purposes consistent with **perfect-being theism**. He critiques thin appeals to free will when nonmoral animals are at issue and instead frames a value theory in which God wills a world rich in emergent goods that presuppose vulnerability: consciousness, sociality, and the drama of life that evolution delivers. The question becomes whether a theistic **aesthetics of creation** can justify a cosmos where predation is both means and milieu for creaturely flourishing, without making God morally complicit in gratuitous suffering.

#### 4. Animal Suffering and the Darwinian Problem of Evil (2020)
Schneider’s major statement, **Animal Suffering and the Darwinian Problem of Evil** (2020), advances a constructive answer. The book rejects what he calls the **Edenic theodicy** that ascribes all animal death to a historical **Fall**, since the paleontological record reveals predation and extinction as intrinsic to life’s unfolding. He offers instead a twofold proposal: first, a **creation-value thesis** grounded in **theological aesthetics**, where the flourishing of biospheric complexity, sentience, and community constitutes a great good God is unsurpassably good to will; second, an **eschatological compensation** claim, developed in dialogue with **Marilyn McCord Adams**, that God will defeat creaturely horrors by bringing created lives into a consummation that overcomes the negative meaning of their suffering.

Biblically, Schneider appeals to **Job** and the Psalms, noting God’s delight in wildness and **Leviathan**, to relativize a simplistic **Eden** ideal and to foreground divine valuation of the nonhuman. He employs **ANE hermeneutics** to read **Genesis 1–3** as theological mythos, disallowing scientific claims about a prelapsarian, deathless biosphere. He then deploys **perfect-being theism** to argue that it is fitting for God to will a process like **evolution** that yields higher-order goods inseparable from the risk of animal pain. The proposal culminates in a robust **animal eschatology**, where divine justice and mercy entail the rectification of creaturely losses in a new creation under **Christ’s cosmic lordship**. The book thus combines analytic argument, biblical rereading, and a teleological narrative of **creation to new creation**, presenting an integrated **evolutionary theodicy**.

#### 5. Rereading the Fall: Adam, sin, and evolutionary history
In parallel with this work, Schneider’s 2010–2011 **BioLogos** essays ignited controversy in Reformed circles by proposing that **original sin** should be reinterpreted in light of **population genetics** and paleoanthropology. He denies a single **historical Adam** as the universal progenitor and instead offers an **archetypal** and communal understanding of **Adam** as a theological type embedded in early Israel’s story. On this view, moral evil arises as an emergent property of hominin social evolution, with human beings universally and inevitably sinning under evolutionary pressures, cultural scaffolding, and spiritual estrangement. Schneider reads **Romans 5** as speaking to the universality of sin and death, not to the **imputation** of Adamic guilt through **federal headship**.

This reinterpretation provoked disciplinary processes at **Calvin University**, given confessional commitments in the **Reformed** tradition to a historical **Fall** and inherited corruption articulated by **Augustine** and received in the **Reformed confessions**. Schneider argued that confessional language could be honored in a nonliteral register, preserving the truth that all are born into sin and under death without positing a single primal pair. He also suggested that the **Fall** should be redescribed as a universal phenomenon of **structural** and **communal** deformation rather than a biological inheritance of guilt. The dispute illustrates Schneider’s progressive method: when **science** and **traditional exegesis** collide, he reframes doctrinal grammar to maintain doxological aims while revising historical claims.

#### 6. Christ, providence, and eschatological defeat of evil
Schneider’s constructive locus for coherence is **Christology** and **eschatology**. He insists that any theodicy worthy of the Christian name must be **Christocentric**, invoking **Colossians 1** and **Romans 8** to depict a groaning creation whose telos is participation in the freedom of the children of God. Within this horizon, **providence** is neither meticulous control nor deistic absent-mindedness, but wise governance of a dynamic creation whose history includes contingency, genuine novelty, and tragic costs that God in **Christ** takes up and transforms. Schneider leans on **Marilyn McCord Adams’s** notion of the defeat of horrendous evils, widening it to the nonhuman case and coupling it with a maximalist **animal eschatology** where creaturely biographies are healed, remembered, and beatified.

The cross functions in Schneider less as satisfaction within **penal substitution** narrowly construed and more as divine solidarity and victory that secures the final rectification of creation. The resurrection is the pledge that every created good is destined for transfiguration, including the meaningful reconstitution of animal lives. This theological-eschatological frame allows Schneider to maintain that the world God in fact created through **evolution** can be the object of divine **perfect goodness**, once its tragic dimensions are transfigured in new creation. Theodicy remains incomplete in history; its vindication is promised in **eschatological consummation**.

#### 7. Dialogue partners and contrasts: Augustine, Irenaeus, and Hick
Schneider’s project is situated within a classic tension between **Augustine** and **Irenaeus** on evil and the Fall. He rejects a straightforward **Augustinian** reading that ties natural evil to a primal catastrophe, yet he retains Augustine’s emphasis on the pervasive reality of **sin**, even as he denies **imputed guilt** through **federal headship**. He finds more affinity with an **Irenaean** or **soul-making** posture exemplified by **John Hick**, though he modifies it by insisting that animals, who are not moral agents, require a distinct rationale and thus a stronger **eschatological compensation**. With **Plantinga**, he shares an analytic commitment to **perfect-being theism** and the defense-theodicy distinction; with **Rowe**, he squarely confronts evidential arguments from evil rather than retreating to skepticism; with **Southgate**, he affirms the theological legitimacy of **evolutionary theodicy** while pressing for more expansive **animal eschatology**.

These dialogues yield key contrasts. Against **Augustinian felix culpa** as applied to human sin, Schneider disperses the causal locus of animal pain into the structural dynamics of **evolution**, not a single primordial moral lapse. Against minimal **skeptical theism**, he offers a positive **aesthetic value-theory** of creation. Against biblicist literalism, he advances **ANE hermeneutics** and genre realism for **Genesis**. And against the suspicion of affluence, he recovers creation’s material goodness in **The Good of Affluence**, insisting that economic life can participate in **shalom** if ordered by **justice** and **charity**.

#### 8. Unity of the oeuvre: creation’s goodness across ethics and theodicy
Read as a whole, Schneider’s oeuvre advances a unified thesis: the **goodness of creation** is broader and more resilient than many theological construals presume, whether in the sphere of **economic life** or in the face of **evolutionary suffering**. **The Good of Affluence** resists a hermeneutics of suspicion toward culture and insists on **ordered loves** as the criterion for responsible wealth. **Animal Suffering and the Darwinian Problem of Evil** resists a hermeneutics of nostalgia toward prelapsarian life and insists on an **aesthetic teleology** in which God can will a world of emergent goods inseparable from vulnerability. In both domains, Scripture is read with **genre sensitivity**, doctrine is reconstructed under **perfect-being theism**, and the future **eschatological** horizon is made decisive for the moral meaning of the present.

At the practical-theological register, the economic and the evolutionary questions converge in Schneider’s appeal to **shalom** and **defeat of evil**. The goods of culture and the drama of nature are not final without **Christ**; both require integration into the economy of redemption: wealth must be sanctified by justice and generosity; creaturely suffering must be gathered into the new creation through **resurrection**. That integrative posture keeps Schneider from reductionism, even as it pushes him toward revisionary proposals on **original sin** and the **Fall** in order to make room for the discoveries of modern science.

#### 9. Reception, controversy, and contribution
Schneider’s proposals have drawn mixed reception. In progressive evangelical and mainline contexts shaped by **BioLogos**, his **evolutionary theodicy** and **animal eschatology** are hailed as creative and pastorally sensitive responses to the **Darwinian problem of evil**. Among analytic philosophers of religion, his work extends the conversation beyond human free will defenses to the nonmoral case, engaging **Rowe** and **Adams** at a high level. Economists and ethicists have found **The Good of Affluence** a bracing corrective to zero-sum moralism, recovering the doctrine of **creation** in economic discourse. Within confessional **Reformed** communities, however, his denial of a **historical Adam** and his critique of **federal headship** trigger deep concern, as does his reading of **Genesis** and **Romans** that many view as incompatible with confessional commitments to **original sin**.

Yet even critics acknowledge that Schneider forces important clarifications: whether **animal suffering** can be theologically accounted for without ad hoc appeals to a universal curse detached from nature’s observed history; whether robust **eschatology** has implications for nonhuman creatures; and whether the church can articulate **creation’s goodness** without collapsing into **prosperity gospel** or into the aestheticization of agony. Schneider’s contribution is to insist that a truly **Christocentric** theology must learn to speak of both economic flourishing and evolutionary pain under the arc of **new creation**, refusing to abandon either domain to secular narratives.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: doctrine of Scripture, providence, and covenant
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Schneider’s strengths are significant: he treats **creation** as dogmatic gold, reads **Scripture** with literary care, insists on **Christocentric eschatology**, takes the scandal of **animal suffering** with intellectual honesty, and resists pietistic disdain for **culture** in **The Good of Affluence**. Nevertheless, deep tensions remain. First, his **Scripture-and-science** method risks letting external canons govern exegesis, such that **Genesis 1–3** and **Romans 5** are reconstructed to fit evolutionary theory rather than allowing the canon to norm the church’s reception of nature under **providence**. A Reformed alternative grounds knowledge in **revelation** and reads nature through a **covenantal** lens, permitting serious engagement with science without relinquishing the historical **two-Adam** structure central to **federal theology** and the doctrines of **imputation** and **original sin**. Second, Schneider’s **perfect-being** and **aesthetic** value-theory can suggest consequentialist justifications for evil that strain the holiness and freedom of God; classical **Augustinian privation** and **felix culpa** place evil under divine permission and redemptive ordination without treating predation as an intrinsic created good. Third, his eschatological compensation for animals, while pastorally appealing, risks eclipsing the confessional center of redemption in **Christ’s atonement** and the covenant of grace. A WTS response would commend Schneider’s moral seriousness and his attention to **animal suffering** and **creation**, but would argue for maintaining a historical **Adam**, **federal headship**, and a **providence** that comprehends evolutionary data without surrendering the canonical grammar of **sin and grace**.
