### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Gregg R. Allison emerges as a leading voice within broad **evangelical** theology, shaped by the institutional strength of the **Evangelical Theological Society** and the ecclesial concerns of **Southern Baptist** life at The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville. His scholarly career is situated in the decades after **Vatican II** 1962–1965, amid resurgent interest in **historical theology**, renewed debates over **Roman Catholic** identity following the 1992 **Catechism**, and intramural evangelical disputes over **ecclesiology**, **gender**, **spiritual gifts**, and **soteriology**. Allison writes as a churchman-scholar, serving local congregational ministry while teaching, which gives his constructive proposals a distinctly ecclesial tone. He self-consciously practices **sola Scriptura** in the classic Reformation sense, distinguishing it from the biblicist **solo Scriptura**. Scripture is the norma normans, while **tradition** functions as norma normata, a ministerial and critical aid. His method stabilizes systematics by triangulating canonical **exegesis**, diachronic **doctrinal development**, and analytic taxonomy through **doctrinal triage** and graded **dogma-doctrine-opinion** distinctions.

Allison’s ecclesial location as a **Baptist** theologian commits him to **believer’s baptism**, **regenerate church membership**, **congregational governance** under a **plurality of elders**, and the language of **ordinances** rather than **sacraments**. Yet his pedagogy is deliberately pan-evangelical. He presents catholic consensus where available, registers intra-Protestant disagreement with clarity, and then argues for congregational convictions without polemic. Theologically, his stance is reformational and confessional, affirming **justification sola fide**, **sola gratia**, and the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture**, while integrating historical voices from **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon** through **Reformation** trajectories to modern evangelical theology. His posture toward **Roman Catholicism** is exemplary of his method: rigorous use of official sources like **Trent**, **Vatican II**, and the **Catechism**, followed by material analysis of structural principles such as **nature-grace interdependence** and **Christ-church interconnection**, culminating in evangelical assessment of doctrines like **justification**, **sacramental economy**, and **authority**.

#### 2. Historical theology as evangelical retrieval
The 2011 volume **Historical Theology: An Introduction to Christian Doctrine** is Allison’s most programmatic methodological work. Its architecture mirrors **Wayne Grudem’s Systematic Theology** to maximize classroom utility, but its content is driven by primary-source synthesis from the **fathers**, **medievals**, **Reformers**, and modern voices. Its distinctive contribution is to place doctrinal loci like **divine attributes**, **Christology**, **atonement**, **Trinity**, **church**, and **sacraments** on a historical map that evangelical students can traverse. By arranging history alongside systematics, Allison forms the habitus of diachronic discernment: reading **Athanasius** on **homoousios**, **Augustine** on **grace**, **Aquinas** on **nature and grace**, **Luther** on **sola fide**, **Calvin** on **union with Christ**, and the **Westminster Standards** on **covenant** and **means of grace**. The book cultivates the ability to distinguish catholic dogma from denominational distinctives and to spot when contemporary proposals repeat older debates under new names.

Allison’s historical work also sharpens terminological precision. The **Baker Compact Dictionary of Theological Terms** 2016 codifies definitions across loci and traditions, demystifying terms like **divine simplicity**, **extra Calvinisticum**, **analogia fidei**, **ordo salutis**, and **epiclesis**. By normalizing bilingual fluency across biblical, historical, and systematic discourse, Allison equips evangelical theology to avoid anachronism and the fallacy of the new. His retrieval is neither antiquarian nor nostalgic; it is instrumental in service of constructive judgments on **ecclesiology**, **anthropology**, and **sacramentology**. This retrieval function is what allows later works, including **Sojourners and Strangers** 2012 and **Embodied** 2021, to be both biblically argued and historically located.

#### 3. Ecclesiology for congregational practice
Allison’s ecclesial magnum opus is **Sojourners and Strangers: The Doctrine of the Church** 2012, the ecclesiology volume in the **Foundations of Evangelical Theology** series. The guiding images are richly biblical: the church as **people of God**, **body of Christ**, **temple of the Holy Spirit**, **bride**, **family**, and **embassy of the kingdom**. He organizes the doctrine through creation-consummation, showing the church as inaugurated in Christ and the Spirit, gathered by the **gospel**, disciplined and nourished by the **ordinances**, and sent in **mission** and **witness**. His Baptist convictions surface clearly: the integrity of **regenerate church membership**, the necessity of **believer’s baptism** by immersion, **congregational governance** under a **plurality of elders** and a qualified **diaconate**, and the importance of **church discipline** as an essential mark alongside **word** and **ordinances**. He is complementarian in leadership structures, aligning with evangelical readings of **1 Timothy 2** and **1 Corinthians 14** while dignifying the manifold ministries of women in the congregation.

On the ordinances, Allison prefers **ordinance** language to avoid implying sacramental causality, though he recognizes the ordinances as covenantal signs that signify and seal, not ex opere operato but through the Spirit’s **instrumentality** tied to the **word** and received by faith. His approach to the **Lord’s Supper** emphasizes memorial and communion dimensions, affirms the **real presence** as the active ministry of the ascended Christ by the **Spirit**, and rejects both **transubstantiation** and **consubstantiation**. Throughout, the ecclesiology is tethered to pastoral realities: **membership covenants**, **catechesis**, **multisite** prudence, **church planting**, and **global mission**. The church is envisioned as a disciplined, missional, and ordered community whose polity serves the **gospel** and whose practices embody **sanctification**.

#### 4. Roman Catholicism: structural analysis and evangelical assessment
Allison’s most widely discussed inter-traditional engagement is **Roman Catholic Theology and Practice: An Evangelical Assessment** 2014, complemented by **The Unfinished Reformation** 2016 with **Chris Castaldo** and **40 Questions About Roman Catholicism** 2021. The genius of the 2014 volume is its identification of deep structures in Catholic theology: the **nature-grace interdependence** in which grace perfects nature and the **Christ-church interconnection** in which Christ extends himself in and through the **church** and its **magisterium**. By reading the **Catechism of the Catholic Church** 1992, **Trent** 1545–1563, and **Vatican II** 1962–1965 as a coherent dogmatic organism rather than as disconnected propositions, Allison explains why Catholic doctrines about **justification**, **merit**, **sacraments**, **Mary**, **purgatory**, and **indulgences** hang together. He engages figures like **John Henry Newman** on doctrinal development and **Joseph Ratzinger** on ecclesiology, showing how **tradition** and **magisterial teaching** function with a materially different authority than **sola Scriptura**.

Against this backdrop, Allison defends evangelical **sola fide** with emphasis on **imputed righteousness**, distinguishing it from **infused grace** and the Catholic combination of **justification and sanctification**. He argues that Catholic sacramentology’s ex opere operato causality and sacerdotal mediation eclipse the sufficiency of Christ’s once-for-all work and the immediacy of the Spirit’s application through the **word**, faith, and the church’s communal practice. His tone is irenic yet firm. He finds common ground where possible, notably on **Trinitarian** orthodoxy and **Christology**, and appreciates the Catholic stress on **catholicity**, **liturgy**, and **moral seriousness**, while urging evangelicals to avoid naive ecumenism that would blur formal and material differences in **authority** and **gospel**.

#### 5. Anthropology and the goodness of embodiment
A striking development in Allison’s recent work is a robust theological **anthropology**. In **Embodied: Living as Whole People in a Fragmented World** 2021 he contends for psychosomatic unity: humans as **ensouled bodies and embodied souls**, created good, fallen, and destined for **resurrection**. He rejects both reductive **materialism** and disembodied **spiritualism**, retrieving a classic **substance dualism** that resists Cartesian split by emphasizing biblical unity. From this base he addresses contested questions: **gender** as a creational given and divine calling, **sexual ethics** grounded in creation and redemption, **technology** and biomedical dilemmas like **reproductive technologies**, **transgender ideation**, **disability**, **aging**, **death**, and Christian practices of **burial** and **mourning**. The conceptual anchor is the goodness of the body under the **lordship of Christ** and the sanctifying work of the **Holy Spirit** in embodied discipleship.

This anthropology is ecclesially oriented. Allison explores how corporate **worship** engages the body through posture, song, fasting, feasting, and especially the **Lord’s Supper**. He emphasizes the communal discernment of the body’s meaning in **baptism** and the table, and he applies Pauline teaching on the **body of Christ** to mutual care, hospitality, and discipline. Throughout, his method remains canonical, historically informed, and pastoral. By integrating **creation-fall-redemption-consummation** into anthropology, Allison resists both culture-war reaction and therapeutic individualism. The resulting account connects doctrinal precision on the **imago Dei** and **sanctification** with counsel for pastors and congregations navigating late-modern fractures over body, identity, and desire.

#### 6. Pneumatology and the ministry of the Spirit
Coauthored with **Andreas J. Köstenberger**, **The Holy Spirit: Theology for the People of God** 2020 synthesizes biblical theology and systematics on **pneumatology**. The book tracks the Spirit’s work from **creation** through **inspiration** of Scripture, **incarnation**, **atonement**, **regeneration**, **union with Christ**, **sanctification**, **spiritual gifts**, and **mission**. The emphasis falls on the Spirit as the **eschatological gift** who actualizes the benefits of Christ and builds up the **church** through **word** and gifts. Their treatment of **spiritual gifts** is conservative and disciplined: they recognize the Spirit’s sovereign bestowal, underscore the primacy of **edification**, and encourage biblically regulated practice, while expressing caution about claims that functionally augment the **canon** or bypass the authority of **Scripture**. The work encompasses the Spirit’s role in **illumination**, **assurance**, and **perseverance**, aligning with reformational emphases on the Spirit’s ministry as the bond of **union with Christ** and the agent of renewal in personal and corporate holiness.

Allison’s pneumatology dovetails with his ecclesiology. The Spirit creates and sustains **regenerate church membership**, gifts a **plurality of elders** for the oversight of the flock, and empowers the ordinances as enacted **gospel**. In mission, the Spirit drives the church outward as an **embassy of the kingdom**, advancing witness through ordinary means rather than triumphalist strategies. In this vision, the Spirit’s work is extraordinary in power, ordinary in means, and relentlessly Christocentric, ensuring that **word** and **church** remain inseparable in the economy of redemption.

#### 7. Pedagogy, triage, and catechesis
Beyond monographs, Allison’s pedagogical instinct is evident in **50 Core Truths of the Christian Faith** 2018, which packages doctrine for church use with outlines, key texts, implications, and discussion questions. He systematizes a taxonomy for **doctrinal triage**: first-order matters that define **orthodoxy** such as the **Trinity** and **justification**, second-order matters that determine **ecclesial fellowship** such as **baptism** and **polity**, and third-order issues for charitable disagreement such as **millennial views**. The goal is not minimalism but ecclesial wisdom, distinguishing what must be confessed from what may be borne with patience for the sake of unity and mission. This triage framework, used alongside the **Baker Compact Dictionary of Theological Terms**, offers churches a template for catechesis and responsible theological conversation.

Allison’s concern for catechesis is also an outgrowth of his historical sensibility. He urges evangelicals to learn from the catechetical rigor of the **Heidelberg Catechism**, the **Westminster Shorter Catechism**, and Baptist confessions like the **Second London Baptist Confession** 1689. He integrates these with contemporary tools to form believers who can articulate **gospel**, perceive the stakes in debates over **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**, and live as witnesses in a secular age. This pedagogical labor is the connective tissue across his corpus: historical retrieval informs systematics, which shapes ecclesial practice, which in turn generates catechesis calibrated for mission.

#### 8. An integrated evangelical vision and a Reformed/WTS evaluation
Taken together, Allison’s corpus sketches an integrated evangelical vision: historically grounded, ecclesially focused, pastorally tuned. **Historical Theology** 2011 trains the instincts; **Sojourners and Strangers** 2012 builds the church’s architecture; **Roman Catholic Theology and Practice** 2014 clarifies evangelical identity over against a rival tradition’s structures; **The Holy Spirit** 2020 animates the church’s life with theology of the **Spirit**; **Embodied** 2021 secures a humane anthropology; and **50 Core Truths** 2018 equips the pews. The throughline is the primacy of **Scripture** as the Spirit’s instrument, the centrality of the **gospel** of **justification by faith alone**, the concreteness of the local **church**, and the goodness of the human **body** under Christ’s lordship. His major interlocutors, from **Aquinas** to **Calvin** to **Newman** and **Ratzinger**, are handled with care, and his assessments of **Trent**, **Vatican II**, and the **Catechism** demonstrate that evangelical critique can be both charitable and unflinching.

From a Reformed and Westminster Seminary perspective, Allison’s work is broadly aligned on **sola Scriptura**, **Trinity**, **Christology**, **original sin**, **penal substitution**, and **justification sola fide**, and his structural critique of **Roman Catholicism** coheres with classic **Reformation** concerns about the **formal** and **material** principles. Tensions appear in ecclesiology and sacramentology. A Westminster reading would demur at Allison’s **ordinance** language and Baptist memorial accent, preferring a robust **means-of-grace** account of **Word and sacrament** with real spiritual communion and covenantal efficacy, along with **paedobaptism** and **Presbyterian polity**. Covenantally, a Reformed alternative frames the church through a single **covenant of grace** that includes believers and their children, not only the **regenerate** discerned through profession. Methodologically, some WTS voices may worry that **doctrinal triage**, while pastorally prudent, risks functional minimalism unless anchored in a full-orbed **confessional** ecclesiology. Yet even with these principled differences, Allison’s disciplined **historical theology**, evangelical **catechesis**, and pastoral **anthropology** represent gifts that the Reformed tradition can gladly receive, adapt, and, where necessary, sharpen within classical **covenant theology** and sacramental **realism**.
