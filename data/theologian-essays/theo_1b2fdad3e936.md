### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Craig S. Keener belongs to the contemporary **Evangelical** guild shaped by the aftershocks of **historical criticism** and the rise of **Pentecostal-Charismatic** renewal. Educated and formed across the late twentieth century, his scholarly vocation took institutional shape at **Palmer Theological Seminary** and then **Asbury Theological Seminary**, where he has served as a leading New Testament professor. His context is the post-**Bultmann** landscape in which the old canons of **Troeltsch’s** criticism, analogy, and correlation still haunt discussions of **miracle** and **history**, and a post-**Hume** epistemology often renders the supernatural a priori implausible. Keener’s method counters this by adopting a **critical-realist** posture that refuses both positivism and subjectivism, marrying a maximal exploitation of **Greco-Roman and Second Temple sources** with a robust **pneumatology** that treats *pneuma* not as an exegetical embarrassment but as a living theological reality. In his own terms, responsibility to the **ancient context**, charity to **ancient testimony**, and submission to **Scripture** guide exegesis. This yields the twin accents that mark his corpus: first, a determination to demonstrate the historical **plausibility** of the New Testament’s claims within ancient historiography; second, a conviction that the **Spirit’s** activity, ancient and contemporary, belongs within Christian knowledge.

#### 2. Tools and temperament: backgrounds, sources, and testimony
Keener’s signature tool is the avalanche of **primary sources**. In **The IVP Bible Background Commentary: New Testament** 1993 and then across mature works on **Matthew** 1999 and **John** 2003, he exhibits encyclopedic control of **Josephus**, **Philo**, **Plutarch**, **Suetonius**, **Tacitus**, **Lucian**, rabbinic literature, inscriptions, and papyri. The aim is not antiquarian display but illumination of **social-scientific** and **rhetorical** textures that make New Testament claims intelligible. He presses an argument about **plausibility structures**: when the ancient world is heard on its own terms, **miracles**, **visions**, and **divine agency** are not outliers but expected features of reality. This is joined to an epistemic rehabilitation of **testimony**. Against **Hume’s** famous essay, Keener contends that global and cross-cultural attestations to **healing** and **exorcism** shift the burden of proof, that uniform experience is a fiction, and that cumulative **inductive** testimony can be rationally weighty. Thus, the twin forces of background and testimony together deflate the a priori dismissal of **charismata** and reset the debate within the contours of ancient **memory** and **witness**. The **Spirit** is not smuggled in; rather, ancient **martyria** is allowed to speak.

#### 3. Evangelical exegesis under pressure: Matthew and John
In commentaries on **Matthew** 1999 and **The Gospel of John** 2003, Keener develops the interplay of **history**, **rhetoric**, and **theology**. For **Matthew**, he reads the evangelist’s typological use of **Israel’s Scriptures** through the twin lenses of **Second Temple Judaism** and **Greco-Roman rhetoric**, arguing that **fulfillment** and **kingdom** function as coherent theological claims rather than midrashic improvisation. For **John**, he advances a historically plausible account of the **Fourth Gospel** as an ancient source shaped by **eyewitness** memory, attentive to *parakletos* and **Spirit-Christology**. Themes like **signs** (*semeia*), **glory**, and **testimony** cohere in a narrative that expects **miracles** as eschatological markers. Keener here anticipates his later **Christobiography** thesis by insisting that **ancient biography** was neither modern stenography nor pious fiction. The **Johannine** claims about Jesus’s identity are construed as rhetorically serious theological historiography. Throughout, the pastoral-exegetical aim is evident: the text’s **authority** is served, not imperiled, by close attention to ancient literary conventions and social realities, an **Evangelical** retrieval of **history** for the sake of **theology**.

#### 4. Lukan historiography and mission: the Acts magnum opus
Keener’s four-volume **Acts: An Exegetical Commentary** 2012–2015 is his most monumental work. It is a tour de force in **Lukan historiography**, where the *proemium* of Luke, the use of travelogues, speeches, and local titles like **politarchs**, and epigraphic controls such as the **Gallio inscription**, all anchor Acts within reliable **ancient historical** craft. Methodologically, Keener advocates a **maximalist** approach to **Luke’s reliability**, arguing that where external controls exist they commend trust, and where they do not, Luke remains a credible ancient historian. Doctrinally, the commentary foregrounds **mission** and **Spirit-empowerment**: **Pentecost**, **charismata**, **visions**, and **healings** function as catalysts for the church’s **missio Dei** to the nations. Keener stresses the programmatic force of Acts 1:8 and reads **signs and wonders** not as mere apostolic credentials but as features of the **kingdom’s** inbreaking. His dense engagement with **Greco-Roman historiography** and **Jewish tradition** aims to normalize Luke’s supernaturalism inside ancient expectations while challenging modern reductionism. The result is a thickly textured picture of **narrative theology**, **redemptive history**, and **ecclesial mission** in which the **Spirit** is the chief actor.

#### 5. Miracles old and new: plausibility, documentation, and critique of Hume
In **Miracles: The Credibility of the New Testament Accounts** 2011 and **Miracles Today** 2021, Keener turns from commentary to sustained **apologetics** for the supernatural’s plausibility. He contests **Hume’s** argument from uniform experience by assembling a staggering dossier of **testimony** to healings and exorcisms across cultures, including medically attested cases. He criticizes the **Troeltschian** principle of analogy that precludes the unique by fiat, proposing instead a **critical realism** that allows extraordinary events if warranted by **evidence**. Keener distinguishes between credulity and cumulative **inductive confirmation**, urging methodological humility before worldwide **Pentecostal** and **majority world** witness. While defending New Testament **miracle** reports through ancient **comparanda** and contemporary parallels, he maintains a theologically careful account of **providence** and **eschatology**: signs are foretastes, not guarantees, of the consummation. The theological polemic here is twofold. Against **naturalistic reduction**, he defends **divine agency** in history. Against **charismatic excess**, he advocates accountability to **Scripture**, sober discernment, and the **church’s** testing of spirits, deploying classic language about *charismata* under **mission** and **holiness**.

#### 6. Christobiography, memory, and the reliability of the Gospels
The 2019 **Christobiography: Memory, History, and the Reliability of the Gospels** synthesizes Keener’s historical and theological concerns. He argues that the Gospels are instances of **Greco-Roman bioi**, a genre that permitted both **selectivity** and **interpretation** while tethering material to remembered **events**. Engaging **Bauckham** on **eyewitness testimony** and disputing **Ehrman** and **Crossan** on late or creative composition, Keener assembles ancient evidence for **reliable memory**, *apomnemoneumata*, and techniques of **mimesis** that shaped how disciples preserved and communicated **Jesus traditions**. He contends that variation is expected within **ancient historiography** and does not entail fabrication, that **oral tradition** can be stable when embedded in controlled community settings, and that the Gospels’ portrayal of **miracles**, **exorcisms**, and **resurrection faith** coheres with ancient expectations for narrating extraordinary lives. The payoff in systematic categories is a bolstering of **Scripture’s historical credibility**, the integrity of **Christology** grounded in narrated deeds and words, and an implicit affirmation of **revelation** situated within providentially guided **history**.

#### 7. Spirit hermeneutics, moral psychology, and ecclesial practice
Keener’s hermeneutical program is explicit in **Spirit Hermeneutics: Reading Scripture in Light of Pentecost** 2016. He argues that the **Spirit** who inspired Scripture now illumines the church to read canonically, missionally, and globally. The claim is not that **experience** trumps **text**, but that the canon must be read within a **Spirit-formed** community that includes the **majority world** and the **poor**, and that readers should expect **continuity** between the **kingdom’s** inauguration and the church’s life. This emphasis is complemented by **The Mind of the Spirit** 2016, where Keener explores Pauline **moral psychology** and *nous* transformation, contrasting **Stoic** virtue discourse with **Paul’s** Spirit-saturated ethics. The Spirit’s work involves reconfigured **desire**, renewed **mind**, and **sanctification** that produces **virtue** as fruit. The hermeneutical result is a triangulation of **text**, **Spirit**, and **community** aimed at faithful praxis. Keener registers caution about subjectivism by privileging **canonical authority**, urging that claims of **revelation** be tested by Scripture and the church’s **discernment**, yet he resists **cessationist** closures that would mute biblical patterns of **charismata** in mission.

#### 8. Social questions and ecclesial witness: women and the shape of ministry
From early in his career Keener addressed contested ecclesial questions, notably in **Paul, Women, and Wives** 1992. There he argues, through intensive **Greco-Roman** and **Jewish** contextualization, that problematic Pauline texts like **1 Corinthians 14** and **1 Timothy 2** must be read within their **rhetorical** and **situational** frames rather than as universal bans. He defends **women’s ministry** as consonant with **Paul’s** practice and the **Spirit’s** distribution of gifts, appealing to the precedent of **Priscilla**, **Phoebe**, and **Junia**. This work embodies his larger method: comprehensive **backgrounds**, careful **exegesis**, and ecclesial **application** under the authority of **Scripture**. It also demonstrates the integrative character of his theology: **pneumatology** informs **ecclesiology**, and mission shapes practice. While he does not present a full-blown **systematic theology**, Keener’s corpus yields a set of doctrinal stabilities: a high **bibliology** that seeks historical credibility, a robust **pneumatology** that expects divine action, a **missional ecclesiology** animated by **charismata**, and an **ethic** of Spirit-formed character and inclusive service.

#### 9. Synthesis and theological contribution
In synthesis, Keener’s enduring contribution is to restore the **historical plausibility** of biblical **supernaturalism** within the canons of rigorous scholarship while articulating a **Spirit**-attuned hermeneutic for the church. Across **Acts**, **Christobiography**, and **Miracles**, he demonstrates that paying maximal attention to **ancient sources** strengthens, rather than weakens, **Evangelical** confidence in **Scripture’s** truthful testimony. His work offers systematic theology a chastened confidence in **revelation-in-history**, a re-centering of **mission** and **charismata** as ordinary features of the church’s obedience, and an account of **testimony** that respects both **global Christianity** and ancient **witness**. As a theologian through exegesis, he mediates between academy and church, modeling how **critical realism** can underwrite doctrinal claims about **providence**, **Christology**, and **sanctification**. His voice is distinctive among contemporary **Evangelicals** for refusing the forced choice between **historical rigor** and **pneumatological** expectancy, employing tools of **Greco-Roman historiography** and **Second Temple Judaism** while confessing the **Spirit** who inspires and illumines.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Keener’s strengths are considerable. His defense of **Scripture’s historical reliability** coheres with classic **Reformed** insistence that the canon speaks truly within **redemptive history**, and his massive documentation in **Acts** and **Christobiography** fortifies **apologetics** against **Troeltsch**-shaped skepticism. His **critical realism** resonates with a chastened account of **reason** under **revelation**, and his emphasis on **mission** echoes **Vos** on the unfolding **kingdom**. Tensions remain. First, on **revelation and epistemology**, Reformed theology prizes the primacy of the **Word** and the *testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum* as principial, while Keener at points leans on **empirical testimony** to rehabilitate **miracle** plausibility. A Reformed correction would subordinate such data more explicitly to **covenantal revelation** rather than treat it as epistemic ground. Second, on **charismata**, the **Warfield**-shaped **cessationist** caution in the WTS tradition resists reading **Acts** as normative, preferring a **redemptive-historical** uniqueness to apostolic **signs** and the foundation-laying era. Keener’s case for ongoing **miracles** is pastorally potent but risks blurring the distinction between canonical **revelation** and postcanonical **providence**. A Reformational alternative would affirm God’s present **providence** and extraordinary **answers to prayer** while delimiting revelatory **gifts** and refusing to ground ecclesial **authority** in contemporary **signs**. Finally, his **egalitarian** conclusions will meet confessional pushback where **creation order** and **covenantal headship** are emphasized. Yet even critics should recognize that Keener’s historical erudition, defense of **Scripture**, and missional **pneumatology** offer valuable correctives to a functional **deism** and strengthen confidence in the God who acts in **history** and speaks in **Word**.
