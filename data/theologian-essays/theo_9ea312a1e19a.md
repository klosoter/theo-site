### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The career of **James C. Scott**, born in 1936 and long based at **Yale**, unfolds across the Cold War critique of **developmentalism** and the postcolonial reappraisal of **state power**. His formation in **Southeast Asian studies** and fieldwork in **Malaysia** placed him amid peasant communities whose lives were shaped by **colonial extraction**, **counterinsurgency**, and the fragile economies of **subsistence agriculture**. The immediate intellectual canvas included **Marxian political economy**, **Weberian rationalization**, and **anthropological thick description** inspired by **Clifford Geertz**, all refracted by the moral urgency of the **Vietnam War** and the failures of top-down **modernization theory**. Scott’s voice consolidated within the Yale Program in **Agrarian Studies**, where he cultivated long arguments against **bureaucratic simplification** and in favor of **vernacular self-organization**. His later phrase **an anarchist squint** names a normative sympathy for noncoercive orders. Yet the heart of his method is epistemic, a defense of *mētis*, practical wisdom embodied in **local practices**, as against the **high modernist ideology** of precise measurement, linear planning, and administrative **legibility**.

Scott’s method mixes **historical anthropology** and **comparative social theory**. The analytical frame is indebted to **E. P. Thompson’s moral economy**, where norms of fairness and reciprocity govern peasant expectations, and to **Karl Polanyi’s embedded markets**, where economic life is submerged within social ties rather than governed by abstract price. He reads **A. V. Chayanov** to grasp the **peasant household** as a labor and consumption unit oriented to subsistence rather than profit maximization. From **Friedrich Hayek** he adopts the **dispersed knowledge problem**, the claim that planners cannot aggregate the tacit intelligence of local actors. From **Michel Foucault** he retrieves **governmentality**, that is, how knowledge and power co-constitute administrative regimes. The result is a synthesis in which **state simplifications** collide with the **messy density of life**, and the tragedy of modernization lies not in ambition alone but in the suppression of *mētis* by an abstract and punitive **synoptic view**.

#### 2. Early works and the grammar of resistance
Scott’s early landmark, **The Moral Economy of the Peasant**, published in 1976, mounted a sustained argument for a **subsistence ethic** that guides risk-averse peasants in Southeast Asia. Against utilitarian accounts that reduce peasant choices to marginal utility, he argued that vulnerability to crop failure and debt shapes a **normative economy** where famine avoidance outranks gains from market participation. Revolts and revolutions are not mere spasms of envy but responses to breaches in **customary reciprocity**, such as predatory taxation or destructive price regimes. This vision of **moral economy** converts economic behavior into an ethical terrain, where justice is measured by livelihood security rather than aggregate productivity.

Expanding that moral field, **Weapons of the Weak**, published in 1985, and **Domination and the Arts of Resistance**, published in 1990, reframed political agency from the spectacular to the ordinary. Scott catalogued **everyday forms of resistance** such as foot-dragging, theft, gossip, false compliance, and subtle shirking, all of which avoid direct confrontation with punitive elites. He distinguished **public transcripts**, the staged deference expected by rulers and landlords, from **hidden transcripts**, the offstage discourse in which subordinates critique power and coordinate subtle dissent. The concept of **infrapolitics** named the submerged politics that sustains dignity and erodes domination without open rebellion. Across these works the analytic of **transcripts** turns attention from public theater to the oblique arts of endurance, where power meets a counterpower of wit, memory, and **vernacular normativity**.

#### 3. Seeing like a state and the critique of high modernism
The pivotal argument of Scott’s corpus arrives in **Seeing Like a State**, published in 1998, a genealogy of **legibility** and **high modernist ideology**. Modern states, he argued, require **standardized categories** in order to tax, conscript, and regulate. They therefore impose **simplifying schemes** on complex ecologies of land, labor, language, and city life. Inventory lists, cadastral maps, legal codifications, and uniform measures yield a **synoptic simplification** that privileges what the center can read. When coupled with a faith in scientific planning and an authoritarian apparatus, such **high modernist ideology** produces catastrophic social engineering. Scott’s inventory of failure ranges from **Prussian scientific forestry** to **Soviet collectivization**, from **villagization in Tanzania** to the rationalist urbanism of **Le Corbusier**. Each case shares a common pattern. Elites trust a **grid of abstraction**, disregard **local knowledge**, disable the feedback loops that correct error, then forcibly align a recalcitrant world with the plan.

Against this, Scott defends *mētis*, practical intelligence distributed among craftsmen, farmers, and urban dwellers who must cope with contingency. The book celebrates **polycentric order** and **vernacular law**, where norms emerge from use rather than from decrees. The problem is not measurement as such but the imperial career of **measure without memory**, a regime that prizes neatness over flourishing. When **civil society** is robust and **mētis** is honored, administrative simplifications can converge with lived complexities. When civil society is prostrate and critique is silenced, the plan grows predatory. **Seeing Like a State** thus codifies the tension between **synoptic power** and **local intelligence**, retrieving an ethic of prudence and a politics of humility before the stubborn opacity of social life.

#### 4. Zomia, evasion, and the earliest states
The civilizational horizon widens in **The Art of Not Being Governed**, published in 2009, where Scott maps **Zomia**, the massif encompassing upland Southeast Asia, as a civilizational zone of **state evasion**. Contrary to teleologies that read hill peoples as primitive leftovers waiting for incorporation, Scott argues that many adopted deliberate technologies of evasion. Swidden agriculture, mobility, segmentary kinship, and orality functioned as forms of **political escape**, enabling populations to avoid the taxes, corvee, enslavement, and warfare of lowland **agrarian states**. The picture reframes **barbarian** and **civilized** as political positions within a geography of rule, suggesting that a great deal of human ingenuity has gone into the cultivation of state-resistant social forms. The claim is not that upland life is idyllic, but that the civilizational narrative of ascent is a fable of **statecraft** rather than a neutral recounting of progress.

Scott’s late work **Against the Grain**, published in 2017, pushes back into antiquity to interpret the **earliest states** as **grain-based polities** built upon sedentism, cereal cultivation, and concentrated labor pools. Cereal grains are divisible, storable, and measurable, which makes them ideal substrates for taxation and provisioning. The book recasts the **Neolithic** not as a sudden leap to leisure and safety but as a tangled bundle of disease, war, bondage, and ecological simplification. Sedentism created **human-grain ecologies** that initially increased vulnerability even as they enabled unprecedented extraction by nascent states. The core thesis is stark. The earliest states grew on the back of **legible agriculture** and coerced labor, and much historical movement reflects a struggle over the boundary between **state space** and **nonstate space**. The historical anthropology of **state formation** therefore converges with the political ethics of **avoidance**, a counterpoint to triumphalist stories about the march of civilization.

#### 5. Two cheers and a normative horizon
Scott gathers his normative stance in **Two Cheers for Anarchism**, published in 2012, an essayistic manifesto for **everyday order** that is not monopolized by the state. The two cheers, rather than three, signals an ambivalence. Scott does not deny the need for coordination or the potential of law to restrain predation. He does argue that the best social orders emerge by **trial and error**, open to **polycentric governance** and constant revision. He prizes **face-to-face accountability**, voluntary association, and **mutual aid**, while distrusting the hubris of planners and the pseudo-omniscience of **technocracy**. The book distills the moral of his earlier histories. Social life improves when **decisions are localizable**, reversible, and informed by *mētis*. It declines when contending authorities are erased in favor of a sovereign rationality that mistakes a **map** for the **territory**.

This normativity translates into a recognizable ethical vocabulary. The virtues are **prudence**, **fidelity to place**, and **civic courage**. The vices are **hubris**, **amnesia**, and **rule by schema**. Scott’s essays evoke an older language of **civic republicanism**, yet the controlling insight remains anthropological. People are not objects but agents who carry **embodied know-how**. Any normative order that forgets this will brutalize in the name of order. The steady contrast between **state simplification** and **vernacular complexity** thus funds a political theology of humility, where legitimate authority submits to the grain of human plurality rather than erasing it.

#### 6. Conceptual tools and theological uses
Scott’s signature categories travel easily into theological reflection. **State legibility** and **high modernist ideology** expose the temptation to build **Babel-like projects** that collapse moral plurality into administrative unity. The category of *mētis* resonates with **prudential casuistry**, a tradition of moral reasoning that bends general norms to the contour of cases through *phronesis*. The analysis of **everyday forms of resistance** clarifies the ethics of **nonviolent dissent**, honoring fragile actors who preserve truth and livelihood beneath oppressive regimes. The **hidden transcript** becomes a conceptual ally for **ecclesial catechesis**, in which doctrinal memory can be cultivated as a counterpublic beneath hegemonic scripts. Finally, the reconstruction of **grain states** and **Zomia** gives texture to biblical and patristic instincts about **exile**, **empire**, and the prudence of **pilgrim communities** that resist absorption.

Applied to contemporary ecclesial questions, Scott’s emphasis on **polycentric order** aids debates about **subsidiarity** and **sphere sovereignty**. Congregational life, diaconal care, and Christian mission can often flourish as **vernacular practices** rather than as projects engineered by remote boards and metrics. This is not a rejection of theology but a counsel that **doctrine must be habited** in the grain of local life. His critique of **technocracy** also contests fatalism about **expert administration** in church institutions. Technical skill is a gift, but expertise untethered from **moral economy** can become a tool of abstraction that forgets persons. Scott’s corpus therefore sharpens the distinction between **means** and **ends**, calling institutions back to the *telos* of justice, mercy, and neighbor love rather than the idol of **efficiency**.

#### 7. Debates, interlocutors, and limits
Scott’s arguments have been clarified and challenged through dialogue with powerful interlocutors. He shares with **Michel Foucault** an analysis of **governmentality**, yet he centers **moral economy** and **subsistence ethics** more than discursive regimes. He echoes **Friedrich Hayek** on **dispersed knowledge**, while resisting a market fundamentalism that would erase **reciprocity** and **custom**. He stands with **E. P. Thompson** and **Karl Polanyi** in insisting that economies are **embedded** in moral life, yet he pushes beyond them in his picture of **state evasion** and the anthropology of **hidden transcripts**. Scholars like **James Ferguson** and **Timothy Mitchell** have extended critiques of **development** and **state effects**, while others have pressed Scott on potential **romanticization** of peasant life or the risks of reading **upland societies** too neatly as intentional refuseniks. Feminist and race critics ask how **hidden transcripts** intersect with **gendered labor** and **racialized governance**, reminding readers that resistance and vulnerability are stratified.

Two methodological limits deserve mention. First, the very category of **legibility** can appear overly dichotomous, yielding a binary of **map** and **territory** that underplays the possibility of just and dialogical **codification**. Not all simplification is oppressive. Moral law, liturgy, and custom all simplify in order to preserve a complex good. Second, the **anarchist squint** risks an anti-teleological ethos that finds it difficult to sustain **institutional reform** where coercion is sometimes necessary to punish evil and protect the weak. Scott occasionally grants this, yet his thick sympathy lies with escape and evasion rather than with the vocation of **righteous rule**. These tensions do not undo his achievement. They invite readers to appropriate his insights within a framework that can affirm both **subsistence dignity** and **legitimate authority**.

#### 8. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed reading receives **James C. Scott** as a providential critic of **Babel-like high modernism**, whose exposure of **state legibility** illuminates the **doctrine of sin in institutions** and the perennial drift of power toward idolatry. His vindication of *mētis* commends a retrieval of **prudence** within **Christian ethics**, affirming that wisdom is often tacit, communal, and learned through **vocational practices** under **common grace**. His emphasis on **polycentric order** aligns with **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, in which differentiated authorities are grounded in creation and covenant rather than absorbed by the state. Yet Scott’s **anarchist normativity** finally lacks a robust **doctrine of magistracy**. A classical Reformed account insists that civil authority is ordained by God to reward good and restrain evil under **Romans 13**, which yields an ethic of **limited but real sovereignty** not reducible to evasion. Likewise, Scott’s epistemic humility lacks a teleological horizon of **creation, fall, and redemption**, which supplies criteria to judge when simplification is service and when it is tyranny. A Westminster-shaped evaluation therefore integrates his critique within a covenantal doctrine of **providence**, where planning is chastened by **antithesis** and guided by **Scripture and natural law** toward the protection of life, livelihood, and neighbor love. The result is not a baptizing of **technocracy**, nor an embrace of pure **anarchism**, but a disciplined preference for **vernacular wisdom**, multi-centered authority, and reforming institutions that honor **moral economy** while acknowledging the state’s ministerial calling under God.
