### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The work of **Andrew S. Kulikovsky** must be located within late modern **evangelical debates** about **Genesis 1–11**, **inerrancy**, and the nature of **biblical hermeneutics** in the face of expanding **scientific paradigms** and aggressive **ANE comparison**. Writing from Australia yet conversant with North Atlantic discussions, he participates in a global conversation catalyzed by organizations advancing **young-earth creationism** and by university and seminary contexts where **two-books** and **accommodation** models were ascendant. Against this background he developed a method marked by **grammatical-historical exegesis**, doctrinal **Sola Scriptura**, and a robust **perspicuity of Scripture**, stressing that the **authorial intent** of the inspired text carries primacy over reconstructive theories of ancient cosmology. His methodological instincts align with a presuppositional rejection of **epistemic neutrality**, insisting that the interpretive community’s **worldview** decisively shapes both exegetical judgments and scientific theorizing.

This orientation is explicit in his essays on **general revelation** and **Scripture**, where **Kulikovsky** resists models that grant **scientific consensus** adjudicatory power over biblical interpretation. He rearticulates **general revelation** in terms of the **Romans 1** disclosure of God’s power and deity, while denying that natural knowledge autonomously supplies detailed **propositional content** about historical or cosmic processes. The resultant method is not anti-science; it is a hierarchically ordered **epistemology** in which **special revelation** norms and interprets our conclusions about the physical world. This stance places him at variance with **concordist** strategies that harmonize Scripture to fit extrabiblical models and with **accommodation** proposals that treat empirical or ANE reconstructions as hermeneutical filters for the opening chapters of Genesis.

#### 2. Hermeneutical principles and polemical posture
At the heart of **Kulikovsky’s** project stands an unwavering commitment to the **grammatical-historical method**, the **analogia fidei**, and biblical **inerrancy**. For him, the lexicon and syntax of **Genesis 1–11** point to **historical narrative** rather than **mythopoesis** or priestly liturgy. He highlights the pattern of Hebrew **waw-consecutive** verbs, the recurring **toledot** structure, the numbered **yom** with evening and morning, and the delineation of kinds, insisting that these are the grammatical marks of straightforward history. From these data he concludes that **Genesis 1** presents a sequence of six ordinary twenty-four-hour days followed by a sanctified **Sabbath**, grounding **creation ordinances** that extend to **marriage**, **labor**, and **worship**.

The polemical edge of this stance is most visible in his sustained critique of the **framework hypothesis** associated with **Meredith G. Kline** and others, and in his engagements with **John H. Walton’s** **functional ontology** of creation. **Kulikovsky** argues that the framework proposal overreads literary symmetry into **Genesis 1**, thereby dissolving the text’s sequential claims and importing a modern genre expectation onto an ancient narrative. With respect to **Walton**, he contends that privileging ANE temple-cosmos parallels and a strictly functional account of creation dislocates the Bible’s material claims about origins and blurs the text’s clear **causal affirmations** about **God’s creative acts**. Throughout these engagements, his hermeneutic insistence remains constant: the **text’s own linguistic signals** and **canonical intertextuality** set the horizon for interpretation, with **ANE parallels** used sparingly and critically, never as a controlling grid.

#### 3. Creation, Fall, Restoration as biblical theology of origins and ends
The integrative ambition of **Kulikovsky’s** approach appears most fully in his monograph **Creation, Fall, Restoration** published in 2009. He frames **biblical theology** in three eschatologically loaded movements: pristine **creation**, world-historic **fall**, and comprehensive **restoration** or **new creation**. The canonical sweep deliberately includes not only **Genesis 1–3** but also **Romans 5**, **Romans 8**, **2 Peter 3**, and **Revelation 21–22**, locating the doctrine of creation within the whole economy of God’s works. He develops an account of the **imago Dei** that grounds human dignity and vocation in proximity to the Creator, and he emphasizes the **dominion mandate** as a covenantal stewardship rather than exploitative mastery. In his hands the **fall** is not an overlay upon an already cruel world but the catastrophic entrance of death and disorder into a previously harmonious creation; thus **natural evil**, predation, decay, and thorns are read as postlapsarian intrusions.

Consequently, the **atonement** and the **resurrection of Christ** are interpreted as inaugurating the **cosmic restoration** anticipated by **Isaiah** and **Paul**, such that the salvation accomplished is not merely anthropological but creational. **Kulikovsky** argues that the Bible portrays an **earth renewed** rather than annihilated, and he reads **2 Peter 3** as purification and transformation rather than total metaphysical replacement. This **new earth** vision underwrites a Christian **environmental ethic** that is neither apocalyptic despair nor utopian progressivism: stewardship counts because **creation matters** to God, yet the decisive consummation of the **new creation** awaits the **parousia**. In this canonical pattern, he ties the **Sabbath rest**, the **temple motif**, and the **priestly vocation** to the created order, thereby embedding ecological and cultural labor within the drama of redemption.

#### 4. Genesis 1–11 as foundational history
While **Kulikovsky** appreciates literary artistry, he rejects claims that **Genesis 1–11** is a mythic preface. He assembles arguments from **Hebrew philology**, narrative **discourse features**, and intra-canonical allusions to assert that **Adam**, **Noah**, and **Babel** are historical referents. The structured genealogies, use of **toledot**, and the narrative tempo carry historical intent, and New Testament texts like **Luke 3** and **Romans 5** treat Adam and the early patriarchs as real figures. He defends a **global flood** with universal scope, rejecting **local flood** hypotheses as exegetically insufficient in light of the comprehensive language of Genesis 6–9 and the covenantal sign of the **rainbow** given to all creation. On chronology, he cautions against positing vast gaps in the genealogies to stretch timelines and argues that the canonical shape supports a **young earth** timescale without demanding a precise date.

His guidance is not simply negative. He offers positive rules for reading **Genesis**: attend to formulae like **and God said**, **and it was so**, observe the logical link between creative fiat and immediate effect, and resist artificial divisions of **bara** and **asah** that sever God’s creating from his shaping. He treats the **Sabbath** of Genesis 2 as a temporal day contiguous with the six, grounding the later **Decalogue** pattern in creation. In short, his **Foundational history** claim is that theology elsewhere in the Bible presupposes the factuality of these events. For **Kulikovsky**, treating early Genesis as non-factual undermines the **doctrines of sin**, **death**, and the **federal headship of Adam**, thereby diluting the evangelical logic of **penal substitution** and the **bodily resurrection**.

#### 5. Science, general revelation, and the two-books debate
A defining thread in **Kulikovsky’s** corpus is his re-specification of **general revelation** and its theological limits. He argues that **Romans 1** and **Psalm 19** describe a revelation of God that is immediate, universal, and morally authoritative, yet not a rival **propositional source** on historical specifics. Because **science** operates through theory-laden interpretation of data, he contends that **scientific consensus** can never occupy the magisterial role in adjudicating biblical claims about **origin**, **history**, or **anthropology**. He explicitly resists a naive **two-books** model that treats the book of nature as an independent test for Scripture, urging instead that **special revelation** supplies the normative framework that makes sense of the created order.

This does not entail hostility to empirical study. Rather, **Kulikovsky** envisions an integrative posture where the **biblical narrative** supplies the true **metanarrative** against which natural phenomena are understood. Hence his rejection of **deep time**, **macro-evolution**, and **theistic evolution** is not a mere a priori dismissal; it is a judgment that these models conflict with the exegetical deliverances of **Genesis 1–11** and the broader **canonical witness** to Adamic headship, the universality of death through sin, and the **Sabbath** structure of time. He calls for methodological humility among Christians in the sciences, welcoming local and tentative readings of natural history while warning that any scheme that overturns **biblical history** lacks Christian warrant.

#### 6. Accommodation, ANE parallels, and genre
On the vexed question of **accommodation**, **Kulikovsky** grants that Scripture employs **phenomenological language** and **anthropomorphisms**, yet he resists appeals to accommodation that would permit divine sanction of **false cosmology** or **historical error**. For him, the **analogy of language** does not legitimate claims that the biblical authors taught ANE cosmological notions as if true; rather, God speaks in ordinary language without endorsing error. He is sharply critical of projects that render **Genesis** a theological proclamation about God’s sovereignty while disclaiming its narrative as material history. In this connection, he interrogates the role of **ANE background**. Without denying comparative value, he argues that ANE parallels are often deployed methodologically to dissolve the text’s own grammar and claims, thereby converting **exegesis** into a form of cultural translation that prioritizes reconstructed **context** over inspired **content**.

In reply, **Kulikovsky** prizes **canonical intertextuality** and the **self-interpretation** of Scripture. He would have Genesis read with **Psalms**, **Job**, **John 1**, **Colossians 1**, and **Hebrews 11**, permitting the Bible’s own ontology of creation to emerge coherently. Such an approach undergirds his critique of **John H. Walton’s** functional thesis: by pressing functions apart from material origination, the reading, in his view, underplays the biblical assertions about **efficient causality** and **historical sequencing**. The upshot is a controlled but confident **genre** analysis: **Genesis 1–11** is high, stylized narrative with didactic intent, yet no less historical for its elevated form.

#### 7. Ethics of dominion and environmental stewardship
An important extension of **Kulikovsky’s** biblical theology is his treatment of **dominion** and **stewardship**. He insists that the **imago Dei** confers royal-priestly vocation, and that **Genesis 1:28** licenses cultivation, development, and scientific inquiry as acts of service rather than exploitation. Yet he refuses both **anthropocentric technocracy** and **biocentric deep ecology**, grounding an ethic of environmental care in the value God places on his **good creation**. Because the **fall** implicates the non-human order, he argues that any ultimate ecological hope must be **eschatological**, vested in the **resurrection** and **new creation** rather than in human engineering or policy, though the latter retain proximate significance.

This ethic yields judgments on contemporary questions: he critiques policies that absolutize wilderness against human flourishing under the guise of sacral nature, and he counters Christian quietism that treats the material world as disposable. By linking **Sabbath**, **jubilee**, and **land** themes with new creation promises, **Kulikovsky** articulates a theology that motivates careful use of resources, recovery of degraded habitats where prudent, and creational gratitude. Such ethical proposals, he claims, align with the **catholic** confession that God will restore the world he made, a world in which cultural goods and redeemed labor find continuity in the **new earth** envisioned by **Revelation 21–22**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and constructive proposals
Across his articles and reviews, **Kulikovsky** has pressed firm criticisms of **Hugh Ross’s** **day-age** reading, **Meredith Kline’s** **framework hypothesis**, and **John Walton’s** **functional ontology**, while disputing **Peter Enns’** proposals about **incarnational Scripture** when they undermine **inerrancy** and **historicity**. He repeatedly returns to the **federal theology** implications of **historical Adam**, arguing that the erosion of **Genesis 3** as history reverberates across **soteriology** and **Christology**. He charges that some evangelical appeals to **ANE cosmology**, **accommodation**, or **theistic evolution** require a hermeneutical double standard, where the Bible is allowed to teach theological truth while its historical claims are domesticated or reversed by external authorities.

Positively, **Kulikovsky** offers constructive guidance: recover the **autopistia** of Scripture, trust the **perspicuitas Scripturae**, employ a disciplined **grammatical-historical** method, and integrate **biblical theology** with **systematic coherence**. He places **Genesis 1–11** at the base of a theological pyramid, insisting that ecclesial teaching on **marriage**, **Sabbath**, **work**, **sin**, **death**, and **redemption** presuppose the truthfulness of these chapters. In this way he seeks to stabilize evangelical theology against the centrifugal pressures of modern hermeneutical skepticism and scientific overreach, without rejecting the goodness of empirical investigation conducted under the **lordship of Christ**.

#### 9. Appraisal and Reformed/WTS evaluation
The chief strengths of **Andrew S. Kulikovsky** are clarity of **hermeneutical method**, courage in defending **biblical inerrancy**, and a canonically rich **creation-fall-restoration** framework that resists both Gnostic spiritualization and secular naturalism. His reading of **Genesis 1–11** as foundational history, his linkage of **Sabbath** and **creation ordinances**, and his emphasis on the **eschatological new earth** commendably retrieve catholic and **Reformed** instincts about the goodness of creation and the cosmic scope of redemption. He is also right to challenge **theistic evolution** and some **ANE**-driven hermeneutics when these dissolve the **historical Adam**, attenuate **original sin**, or subordinate **special revelation** to shifting **scientific consensus**.

From a **Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, several tensions remain. First, while rightly subordinating **general revelation** to **Scripture**, his claim that general revelation is non-propositional risks truncating the classic **two-books** teaching affirmed in **Westminster Confession 1.1**, which recognizes genuine though suppressed knowledge of God and the world that is intellectually contentful, even if always misread apart from grace. A Van Tilian **covenantal epistemology** would say not that general revelation lacks propositional content but that sinners suppress it and require **Scripture** for right interpretation; here a sharpened account of the **principia** of theology could refine his model. Second, his resistance to **accommodation** sometimes underestimates the catholic doctrine that God truly accommodates without endorsing error, employing analogical language suited to finite hearers. A Reformed alternative would distinguish **accommodation** as fitting condescension from accommodation as error license, thus maintaining **divine truthfulness** while recognizing linguistic condescension. Third, while his **grammatical-historical** work is strong, a more explicit **covenantal** and **redemptive-historical** framing could deepen his readings, situating **creation ordinances** within the broader **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** architecture prized in classical Reformed theology. None of these cautions undermine his central contributions; rather, they indicate where **Reformed orthodoxy** can both affirm his **Sola Scriptura** and **historical** commitments and offer principled clarifications on **revelation**, **covenant**, and the integration of **nature** and **grace**.
