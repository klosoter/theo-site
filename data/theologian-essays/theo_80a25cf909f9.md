### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the shape of a Reformed retrieval
The work of **J. Todd Billings** emerges from the crucible of late-modern Protestant fragmentation, where **therapeutic individualism** and consumerist liturgies shape ecclesial life as much as doctrine. Trained in historical and doctrinal studies with a **Th.D. at Harvard Divinity School** in the mid-2000s and serving at **Western Theological Seminary** in Holland, Michigan as the **Gordon H. Girod Research Professor of Reformed Theology**, Billings situates himself as a pastor-theologian within the **Reformed Church in America**. His constructive program draws deeply on **Augustine** and **Calvin**, reaches critically toward **Aquinas** and **de Lubac**, and engages **Barth** and **Radical Orthodoxy**, yet it remains tethered to the **confessional Reformed** grammar of **Creator-creature distinction**, **grace as gratuitous gift**, and **means of grace**. The ethos of his project is ecclesial and doxological: theology exists for **the praise of the triune God**, the formation of **Christ’s body**, and the witness of **Word and sacrament**. In this sense, his contribution can be read as a Reformed mode of **ressourcement** in an age of disembedding, a recovery of **participation in Christ** not as metaphysical bravado but as evangelical proclamation, **unio cum Christo** as the evangelical nerve of sanctified existence.

Methodologically, Billings leans into the **theological interpretation of Scripture**, advocating an **analogia fidei** that reads the canon within the church’s rule of faith and liturgical life. This methodological posture stands over against a merely historicist **biblicism** and an a-contextual **systematics**, insisting that living encounter with the **triune God** in the economy of **Word and sacrament** orders both exegesis and doctrine. While appreciative of **de Lubac** and the sacramental imagination of the patristic tradition, Billings resists a nostalgia for a seamless **nature-grace** synthesis, preferring **Calvin’s** austere **Creator-creature distinction** and the evangelical insistence that grace is not an ontological supplement to nature but a **Christic gift** that effects **union** by the **Spirit**. His own life-threatening diagnosis of **multiple myeloma** in 2012 deepened his ecclesial method, knitting together **lament**, **mortality**, and **eschatological hope** as integral to doctrinal retrieval rather than therapeutic addenda.

#### 2. Calvin, participation, and the grammar of gift
Billings’s first major monograph, **Calvin, Participation, and the Gift** (2007), positions his voice within debates over **participation** in post-Reformation theology. Against caricatures that **Calvin** severed believers from God by sheer **extrinsic imputation**, Billings reconstructs a robust **unio cum Christo** in Calvin as the matrix of **duplex gratia**: believers receive both **justification** and **sanctification** as inseparable benefits in the one Christ by the **Spirit’s** bond. Far from diminishing creaturely agency, this **participatory realism** undergirds a sanctified life in gratitude, or *gratia* as both gift and thanksgiving. He highlights how Calvin’s **extra Calvinisticum** protects the transcendence of the **Son** in his divine nature even in the *status exinanitionis*, thereby securing communion with the whole Christ without collapsing the **Creator-creature distinction**. Here Billings subtly critiques strands of **Radical Orthodoxy** that equate robust **participation** with the erosion of such distinction, arguing instead for a **Reformed participation** that is christologically centered and pneumatologically mediated, governed by **Scripture** and the **gospel**.

The concern for **gift** language engages **de Lubac** and the modern debate over the **analogia entis** and a so-called **pure nature**. Billings contends that for **Reformed orthodoxy**, the gratuity of grace is not a response to a stable natural desire for the beatific vision but a **sovereign bestowal in Christ** that creates what it commands. Thus **grace perfects nature** only as **re-creation** in **Christ**, not as the gentle elevation of a still-intact teleology. This reframing preserves the evangelical force of **justification by faith** and **union** while allowing a thick ontology of participation that avoids Pelagian drifts. The upshot is a grammar of **gift** that resists both voluntarist nominalism and sacralized ontologism, attempting a via media that is recognizably **Calvinian** and confessionally **Reformed**.

#### 3. Scripture for the church and the rule of faith
In **The Word of God for the People of God** (2010), Billings expands his methodological convictions, making a case for **theological interpretation of Scripture** as an ecclesial habitus. He argues that the **canon**, read within the **regula fidei** and in the context of **baptismal** and **eucharistic** practice, forms the church into the likeness of **Christ**. Drawing on **Augustine’s** hermeneutics of charity and **Barth’s** insistence on God’s **self-revelation**, Billings articulates an **analogia fidei** that resists flattening **Scripture** into the history-of-religions project while equally resisting an isolated **proof-texting** that ignores christological and covenantal unity. He emphasizes the service of doctrine to exegesis and vice versa, a circularity governed by the **Spirit** who unites the church to the **totus Christus**.

Billings’s approach stands in friendly dialogue with proponents of **canonical criticism** and **figural reading**, yet he insists on distinctively **Reformed** anchors: the **perspicuity of Scripture**, the priority of proclamation in **Word and sacrament**, and the formative primacy of Lord’s Day worship. Thus the interpretive community is not the academy or the market but the gathered **ekklesia**, under discipline and the **means of grace**. The hermeneutical center remains **union with Christ**, since most of Scripture’s promises are yes and amen in him. This hermeneutical stance pushes back against a purely **immanent ethics** while guarding against **speculative metaphysics**, aiming at a doxology where the **triune God** addresses a pilgrim people.

#### 4. Union with Christ as evangelical center
With **Union with Christ** (2011), Billings translates his retrieval of **unio cum Christo** into an accessible constructive thesis for ministry. He insists that the **duplex gratia** of **justification and sanctification** are distinct yet inseparable benefits given in union, thereby countering both moralistic reduction and antinomian grace. He retrieves key **Reformed confessions** and the **Heidelberg Catechism** to display how catechesis unfolds from **grace** to **gratitude**, not merely from doctrine to duty. Pastoral idioms like **moralistic therapeutic deism** are critiqued as distortions that refuse the cruciform form of **participation**. The book draws on **Athanasius** and **Cyril** for the soteriological axiom what is not assumed is not healed, yet disciplines this patristic intuition with **Calvin’s** Christology and the **extra Calvinisticum**, keeping communion from collapsing into confusion of natures.

The pastoral payoff is evident. **Union with Christ** becomes the seedbed for practices like **baptismal remembrance**, **Lord’s Supper** participation, and habitual **lament** and **prayer**. Billings argues that catechetical and liturgical renewal will outflank anxiety-driven programming because the Spirit conforms believers to **Christ** by appointed **means of grace**. Churches that situate mission within this union avoid the ditch of activism and the swamp of quietism, as sanctification is neither self-starting nor detached from the ascended Christ’s ministerial agency.

#### 5. Lament, providence, and the impassible God who suffers in Christ
The autobiographical-theological work **Rejoicing in Lament** (2015) extends Billings’s core thesis into a theology of suffering, **providence**, and **mortality**. Diagnosed with **incurable cancer**, Billings reads Scripture’s **Psalms of lament** as the church’s voice in union with Christ, refusing both stoic denial and despairing resignation. He retrieves **classical theism** with careful nuance, affirming **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** while speaking of God’s compassion in the economy: God does not suffer change in his essence, yet the **Word** truly suffers in the flesh for us and for our salvation. This evangelical **impassibility** allows the believer to lament honestly without projecting our passions onto the **divine life**, because comfort rests in the **immutable** and **faithful** God revealed in the crucified and risen **Christ**.

Billings confronts modern therapeutic patterns head-on. He critiques the fantasy of control that pervades medicalized culture and the pseudo-eschatology of cure-at-all-costs. Lament is not a private catharsis but an ecclesial discipline, shaping hope as **resurrection** hope rather than optimism. The **doctrine of providence** is rendered christocentrically through **union**, not through speculative decrees, and the **Heidelberg Catechism** becomes a pastoral companion that locates comfort in belonging to **Jesus Christ, body and soul**. Here Billings demonstrates how doctrinal retrieval, when tethered to **Word and sacrament**, yields hospitable spaces for weakness without diluting the sovereignty and holiness of the **triune God**.

#### 6. Eucharistic mémoire and eschatological hope
In **Remembrance, Communion, and Hope** (2018), Billings offers a constructive **Reformed** theology of the **Lord’s Supper**, threading between **Zwinglian memorialism** and **Roman transubstantiation** by defending **Calvin’s spiritual real presence**. The Supper is **anamnesis** that makes present the covenantal promise of the crucified and risen **Christ** by the **Spirit**, forging **communio** in the body and anticipating the marriage supper of the Lamb. He retrieves **patristic** and **medieval** sources while maintaining the **Creator-creature distinction** and **extra Calvinisticum**, arguing that communicants truly feed on **Christ** sacramentally, not by a change in the elements but by the Spirit’s ascent of faith to the heavenly Christ.

This sacramental theology functions as cultural critique. Against consumerist liturgies, the **Eucharist** is enacted eschatology, forming a people in **gratitude** and **mission**. Billings ties the table to **ecclesial discipline**, **reconciliation**, and **justice**, yet he resists collapsing sacrament into social program. The **means of grace** are declared to be God’s instruments for forming a cruciform community, and the church’s witness flows from the table outward. Thus **sacramental participation** is not an ontology of sheer presence but a covenantal participation in the ascended **Christ**, under the Word’s promise.

#### 7. Mortality, memento mori, and sanctified finitude
With **The End of the Christian Life** (2020), Billings articulates an ethic of **mortality** and **hope** keyed to **union with Christ**. He urges practices of *memento mori* within a culture allergic to death, recovering the wisdom of **Augustine** and **the Heidelberg Catechism** regarding dying well in Christ. He argues that modernity’s denial of finitude is a doctrinal and liturgical failure: without the church’s daily dying and rising in **baptismal identity**, death becomes either anesthetized or absolutized. Billings navigates between sentimentalizing death and depicting it as a mere gateway; he insists that death is the last enemy, truly defeated in the **resurrection**, yet still to be faced with sober **lament** and communal care.

The book integrates doctrine and practice: funerals as **gospel rites**, **psalmic lament** as congregational discipline, and **Lord’s Supper** as a foretaste of the banquet that revokes death’s dominion. Here Billings’s signature triad of **Scripture, sacrament, and sanctification** coheres. By rooting ethical formation in **union with Christ**, he avoids both a natural-law moralism and a voluntarist activism, proposing instead a cruciform patience that awaits the **parousia** with hope and endurance.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and the calibrated participatory proposal
Across his corpus, Billings positions himself between **Barthian** reserve toward participation and **Radical Orthodoxy’s** exuberant participatory metaphysics. He receives **Aquinas** and **de Lubac** as resources while delimiting their **nature-grace** grammar by **Calvin’s** christocentric and pneumatological focus. He deploys **analogia fidei** rather than **analogia entis** as his hermeneutical spine, contending that the church knows God through God’s own **self-gift** in **Christ** and by the **Spirit** in the canonical **Word**. His reading of **Calvin’s extra Calvinisticum** and **supper theology** pushes against the charge that Reformed theology is necessarily extrinsic or disenchanted, without granting an ontology that dilutes the **Creator-creature distinction**.

Billings’s engagement with contemporary ecclesial practice reflects similar calibration. In dialogue with **James K. A. Smith** on **cultural liturgies**, with **Hauerwasian** ecclesiology, and with missional theologies, he foregrounds the **means of grace** as the engine of formation. The accent falls on the **local church** gathered to hear the **Word** and receive the **supper**, not on technique or sentiment. By placing **union with Christ** at the center, he reframes ministry as participation in the ascended **Christ’s** mission, thereby measuring church life by **baptismal** identity and **table** practice rather than by metrics of scale, novelty, or consumer satisfaction.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Billings’s project offers notable strengths and revealing tensions. Positively, his recovery of **unio cum Christo** as evangelical center, his insistence on the **means of grace**, and his pastoral deployment of **lament** and **mortality** richly serve confessional piety and ecclesial stability. His defense of **Calvin’s spiritual presence**, **extra Calvinisticum**, and the **Creator-creature distinction** keeps his **participation** proposal within a recognizably **Reformed** frame, and his affirmation of **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** in the key of the **incarnation** aligns with classical theism. Yet questions remain. First, the grammar of **participation** can blur if it is not more explicitly subordinated to **covenant** architecture. A Westminster-shaped alternative would press the **covenant of grace** and **federal union** as the architectonic under which **mystical union** is administered, preserving a juridical backbone that guards **justification’s** forensic primacy even as **sanctification** flows inexorably from it. Second, in hermeneutics, the **theological interpretation** program needs clearer integration with a **redemptive-historical** method that traces covenantal epochs in Scripture to protect christological reading from flattening typology or allegorical overreach. Third, on nature and grace, despite his caution, occasional gestures toward a broad **sacramental ontology** could invite confusion; a stricter deployment of **analogia fidei** and **special revelation** as principium would safeguard against importing **analogia entis** by another name. Finally, the cultural and ethical proposals would gain by sharper use of **two-kingdoms** or **sphere sovereignty** lines to prevent ecclesial mission from bearing undue social weight. These adjustments would not negate Billings’s contribution; rather, they would secure his valuable retrievals within the most durable resources of **Reformed orthodoxy** and **Westminster** federal theology.
