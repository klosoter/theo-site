### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
James M. Todd III emerges within the **evangelical** renaissance of **biblical theology** that followed the late twentieth-century turn toward **canon-wide, Christocentric interpretation**. His work appears in a post-2000 landscape shaped by **inaugurated eschatology**, **Second Temple Judaism**, and debates on **covenant continuity**. Educated within the orbit that produced **Progressive Covenantalism** — associated with figures like **Stephen Wellum** and **Peter Gentry** — Todd deploys a method that weds **close exegesis** to **covenantal structure** and **typology**. The signature of his approach is a conviction that the **old covenant** at **Sinai** was a historically bounded arrangement whose laws functioned as **covenantal identity markers** for Israel, and that these laws reach their telos in **Jesus Christ**. The frame is canonical and redemptive-historical rather than purely dogmatic. He reads **Torah** through the lenses of **Matthew 5:17–20**, **Acts 15**, and **Pauline law theology** as an unfolding of **Gods plan** culminating in the **new covenant** promised in **Jeremiah 31** and enacted by the **Spirit**. This method assumes a coherent, progressive revelation that yields a transformed but not arbitrary **Christian ethic** anchored in **the law of Christ**.

#### 2. The central thesis of Sinai and the Saints, 2017
In **Sinai and the Saints** Todd articulates a single, clarifying thesis about **law and gospel**: all laws given at **Sinai** are part of the **old covenant** and as such are not binding on the church as a legal code, yet the whole legal corpus remains God-breathed instruction whose **meaning and moral import** are transposed through **Christological fulfillment** into the **new covenant**. He rejects the classic **tripartite division** of the law into **moral, civil, ceremonial** as exegetically unmarked and covenantally misaligned. For Todd, the decisive line is not internal to the Mosaic code but historical-covenantal — **old covenant** versus **new covenant**. Theologically, he treats **fulfillment** not as mere abolition but as **eschatological transformation**. Ethically, he grounds Christian obligation in the **law of Christ**, a phrase he gathers from **1 Corinthians 9:20–21** and **Galatians 6:2**, where **Spirit-wrought conformity** to **Christ** and his **apostolic instruction** constitutes the normative frame. The upshot is a positive hermeneutic of **Torah** for Christian formation that neither reinstates **Sinai** nor discards its **wisdom**, but reads it as **typology**, **moral logic**, and **Christ-revealing trajectory**.

#### 3. Exegesis of Matthew 5:17–20 and the grammar of fulfillment
Todd devotes sustained attention to **Matthew 5:17–20** where Jesus declares he came to **fulfill the Law and the Prophets**. He argues that **plerosai** signals comprehensive **eschatological completion**, not simple **augmentation**. This fulfillment is covenantal and messianic, locating **Torah** within the **kingdom** mission of **the Son**. The continuity is textual and teleological — every **iota and dot** bears witness to the **Messiah** — while discontinuity arises from the arrival of the **new covenant** community gathered around **Jesus**. On this reading, the **Sermon on the Mount** functions as **royal Torah**, establishing **Christ** as the authoritative interpreter and transformer of **Mosaic law**. The so-called antitheses, You have heard... but I say to you, are not intensifications of a timeless **moral law** in the abstract, but **covenantal reconfigurations** that manifest the **heart righteousness** promised in **Jeremiah 31** and **Ezekiel 36**. Thus **adultery of the heart**, **truthful speech**, and **enemy love** are not additive rules but the **Spirit-formed ethos** of the **new creation**, displaying how **Sinai** reaches its ordained end in the **Messianic King** and his people.

#### 4. Paul, the law of Christ, and the end of the old covenant
Turning to **Paul**, Todd reads texts like **Romans 10:4**, **Galatians 3–5**, and **1 Corinthians 9** as asserting that **Christ is the telos of the law** such that believers are not **under the law** as **Sinaitic covenant**, yet are positively **enslaved to God** under the **law of Christ**. The **pedagogue** of **Galatians 3** signals a time-bound administration that served until **Christ**, after which the **Spirit** reconstitutes the people of God beyond **ethnic Israel** and beyond **Torah boundary markers** like **circumcision**, **Sabbath**, and **food laws**. In **1 Corinthians 9:20–21**, Paul can flexibly become as under the law to win Jews and as outside the law to win Gentiles, while still under the **law of Christ**, which Todd construes as the **apostolic, Christ-shaped norm** for the church. Here **Galatians 5** is decisive: the fruit of the **Spirit** fulfills the **moral intention** of the law without returning to **Sinaitic stipulations**. For Todd, this Pauline grammar coheres with **Acts 15**, where the **Jerusalem Council** refuses to bind the **Gentile** churches to **Mosaic law**, ratifying a **new covenant** order grounded in **Christ** and the **Spirit** rather than **Sinai**.

#### 5. Identity markers, typological transformation, and wisdom retrieval
A distinctive contribution is Todd's emphasis on **identity markers** and **typology**. Laws concerning **circumcision**, **Sabbath**, **diet**, **purity**, and **sacrifices** functioned as **covenantal badges** for Israel, setting them apart among the nations. Under **Christ**, these markers are transposed into **baptism**, **the Lord's Supper**, and the **ethos of cruciform love**, all enacted by the **Spirit**. The **sacrificial system** becomes the once-for-all **atonement** of **Christ**, and the **temple** becomes the **church** as **Spirit-indwelt** temple. Even civil and cultic stipulations carry **typological wisdom** that discloses **God's character** and **moral logic**. Todd encourages pastors to mine **Leviticus** for **pastoral theology** by tracing typological trajectories into the **new covenant**, discerning the **holy-love** of God, his **care for the vulnerable**, and his concern for **ordered worship**. The hermeneutical maxim is neither repeal nor repristination, but **fulfillment-conditioned retrieval**. In this way, the whole of **Torah** remains profitable, yet the church resists importing **Sinaitic polity** into **ecclesial life**, preserving the once-for-all shift from **shadow** to **substance** in **Christ**.

#### 6. Against tripartite division, Theonomy, and Dispensationalism
Todd argues that the **tripartite division** of **moral, civil, ceremonial** misreads the covenantal unity of **Mosaic law**. He contends that Scripture does not mark such divisions in a way that grounds discrete categories of ongoing obligation. Instead, the law is a **covenantal package** tied to **Sinai**. This critique extends to **Theonomy**, which he sees as a category error that absolutizes **Israel's civil law** beyond its **theocratic** setting. Conversely, he resists **classic Dispensationalism** for locating discontinuity primarily in an epochal schema that fragments canonical unity and sidelines **typology** and **kingdom-through-covenant** trajectories. Todd positions his proposal as a **progressive covenantal** via media that preserves the **canonical unity** championed by **Gentry and Wellum**, while maintaining robust **new covenant** discontinuity with **Sinai**. His analysis of **Acts 15** and **Hebrews 7–10** underwrites the claim that priesthood, cult, and polity are fulfilled and therefore nonbinding as a code, even as their **moral-theological substance** continues through **Christ** in **Spirit-shaped practices**.

#### 7. The Decalogue, Sabbath, and creation order
One of Todd's most debated moves concerns the **Decalogue** and the **Sabbath**. He resists identifying the **Ten Commandments** as a timeless **moral law** simpliciter that binds the church, arguing instead that the **Decalogue** is the **covenant document** of **Sinai**. Its abiding value is maximal as **revelation**, yet its covenantal form is historically located. The **Sabbath** is treated as an **identity marker** that signified covenant rest and loyalty for Israel and that reaches fulfillment in **Christ's resurrection**, the **Spirit's rest**, and the **already-not-yet** orientation of **new creation**. Accordingly, Todd commends the **Lord's Day** as wise and ecclesially fitting without grounding it in a direct transposition of the **fourth commandment** as law. He also appeals to **creation order** to show that moral realities like **marriage**, **truth telling**, and **justice** predate **Sinai**, yet he channels their normativity through **Christ** and **apostolic teaching**, thus avoiding a simple equation of **creation norms** with the **Decalogue's** legal form. The result is a nuanced account that distinguishes **creational morality** from **Sinaitic covenant form** while affirming their deep coherence in **God's will**.

#### 8. Ecclesial ethics and pastoral application under the law of Christ
Todd's practical interest is the shape of **Christian ethics** under the **law of Christ**. He emphasizes **Spirit-empowered obedience**, **union with Christ**, and **ecclesial catechesis** that trains believers to read **Torah** as **wisdom** rather than as a rulebook. In sexual ethics he stresses the **creation-covenant** testimony of **Genesis 1–2** as confirmed by **Jesus** in **Matthew 19**, locating **marriage** and **chastity** in the **law of Christ**. In social ethics he mines **Old Testament case laws** for **moral trajectories** toward **justice**, **care for the poor**, and **integrity in commerce**, always transposed through **new covenant** identity and mission. Worship is guided by **apostolic patterns** that fulfill **temple theology** in **Christ** and the **church**, not by **Sinaitic rituals**. The **third use of the law** is reframed as the **discipling function** of **gospel norms** grounded in **Christ** and taught by the **apostles**, rather than as a direct appeal to the **Decalogue** as binding code. The net effect is a coherent, pastorally deployable paradigm that keeps **Christ** central and equips the church to read **Moses** with **apostolic eyes**.

#### 9. Interlocutors, influences, and placement within evangelical theology
Todd locates himself within the **Progressive Covenantalism** of **Gentry and Wellum**, sharing their emphasis on **kingdom through covenant**, **typology**, and **new covenant** priority. He aligns with **Thomas Schreiner** on the non-binding nature of **Mosaic law** and the governing role of the **law of Christ**, and with **D. A. Carson** on the **centered-set** of **Christological fulfillment** in **Matthew**. He debates **Reformed orthodoxy** where it identifies the **moral law** with the **Decalogue** as perpetually binding, and he rejects **Theonomy** as a misapplication of **Israel's civil code**. Against **Dispensationalism**, he insists on **canonical unity** and robust **typological fulfillment**. His work addresses a broad evangelical audience, aiming to resolve perennial confusion about **Christians and the law** by giving pastors and scholars a simple, covenantally precise rule: read every **Old Covenant law** as fulfilled in **Christ**, then retrieve its **wisdom** through **apostolic teaching** for **church** and **mission**. That rule defines his place within the contemporary conversation on **biblical theology** and **ethics**.

In Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, Todd's model offers salutary strengths and also exposes tensions. Positively, his insistence on **Christological fulfillment**, **Acts 15 discontinuity**, and a canonical, **Spirit-centered** ethic counters both **Theonomy** and antinomian misuse of **grace**. Yet his rejection of the **tripartite law** and his reluctance to grant the **Decalogue** a uniquely normative status strain **classical Reformed** claims that the **moral law** is a summary of **natural law** rooted in **creation** and perpetually binding. The Reformed alternative grounds the **third use of the law** in the **Decalogue** precisely as a creationally indexed, covenantally republished norm, with the **Sabbath** as a creation-ordinance transfigured but still binding in Lord's Day rest and worship. From a **WTS** standpoint, Todd's typological transformation risks flattening **creation-order morality** into redemptive-historical change, weakening the principial role of **law** as a transcript of **God's character**. A Reformed correction would retain Todd's **Christocentric, covenantal hermeneutic**, while reaffirming the **perpetuity of the moral law**, the **unique authority of the Decalogue**, and the **Lord's Day** as the new-covenant form of the **fourth commandment**.
