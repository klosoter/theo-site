### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Marc Cortez belongs to the generation of **contemporary evangelical** theologians who absorbed the post-Barthian imperative that all doctrine be reconfigured from **Jesus Christ**, while also learning to argue with the conceptual rigor of **analytic theology** and the historical density of **retrieval**. Educated at the **University of St Andrews** under **Alan J. Torrance**, he began teaching at **Western Seminary** before moving to **Wheaton College** in the mid-2010s, institutions that reflect a broad **evangelical** confessionalism attentive to Scripture and the classic creeds. The intellectual field around him included debates on **nonreductive physicalism**, the renaissance of **Thomistic hylomorphism**, and the reappearance of the **patristic** lexicon in Anglophone dogmatics. Cortez positioned himself at this confluence, arguing that **theological anthropology** must be normed by **Christology**, yet argued and specified with the precision of contemporary philosophy and the catholicity of historical theology.

Cortez’s methodological center is a disciplined **christological anthropology**: who and what humans are is finally disclosed in **Jesus Christ** as the true image, reconciler, and telos of humanity. This is neither an abstract appeal nor a pious overlay. He treats **imago Dei**, **sin**, **gender**, **disability**, and **mind–body** questions as problems whose grammar is fixed by **incarnation**, **atonement**, and **resurrection**. At the same time, he exhibits analytic habits: clarifying terms, differentiating **substance dualism**, **property dualism**, **nonreductive physicalism**, and **hylomorphism**, and testing theological assertions for coherence with **Scripture** and creedal commitments like **homoousios** and **communicatio idiomatum**. His retrieval stretches from **Irenaeus** and **Athanasius** through **Maximus the Confessor** and **Aquinas** to **Calvin** and **Barth**, with special attention to the christological idiom of **anhypostasis** and **enhypostasis** as a conceptual template for personal identity.

#### 2. Early project: mind–body and christological anthropology
Cortez’s first monograph, **Embodied Souls, Ensouled Bodies** (2008), addressed the evangelical crisis over the **mind–body debate**. Theological classrooms were divided between **Cartesian dualism** and **nonreductive physicalism** associated with **Nancey Murphy** and **Joel B. Green**, while a renaissance in **Thomistic hylomorphism** and variations of **emergent dualism** complicated the map. Cortez critiques simplistic identifications of biblical teaching with any one philosophical thesis, insisting that **Scripture** centrally confesses the goodness of **embodiment**, the reality of **death**, the hope of **resurrection**, and some kind of **personal continuity** across death that many traditions describe as an **intermediate state**. Drawing on **Christology**, he argues that careful use of the **anhypostasis–enhypostasis** distinction helps theologians think identity without reduction: a human person is neither simply a separable soul nor merely an aggregate of parts but a unified being whose psychosomatic life is irreducibly embodied.

The proposal Cortez advances there has been described as **holistic dualism**. He resists reductive **physicalism** because it strains to account for the church’s confession of **personal survival** and the **intermediate state**, yet he resists crude **substance dualism** because it often marginalizes biblical **embodiment** and leaves resurrection a dispensable add-on. He takes cues from **Aquinas** on **hylomorphism** and from **Maximus** on the integrity of natures to suggest that the **soul** is the human form of life, inseparable from the body in normal human existence, and yet capable of subsisting by divine sustenance between death and resurrection. The christological analogy disciplines the move: one does not identify the union of soul and body with the **hypostatic union**, but one does learn from Christ how to reason about identity across transformations without collapsing **nature** into **person** or dividing the subject into parts.

#### 3. Mapping the field: the Guide for the Perplexed
With **Theological Anthropology: A Guide for the Perplexed** (2010), Cortez offered evangelical students a cartography of the doctrine with unusual breadth and clarity. He parses the classic triad of **imago Dei** models as **substantive**, **functional**, and **relational**, showing both their exegetical warrants and their vulnerabilities in light of **Christology** and **eschatology**. He frames **sin** as the vandalization of vocation rather than the destruction of ontology, and he connects **salvation** to the restoration of human life in **union with Christ**. The book treats contested themes such as **gender and sexuality**, **race**, and **disability**, arguing that christologically normed anthropology will guard the creational goodness of diverse bodies while refusing capacity-based definitions of the **image** that marginalize the vulnerable.

The Guide’s contribution lies in its consistent tethering of each anthropological question to **Scripture** and to classical doctrinal loci. Discussions of **freedom and determinism** are placed within **providence** and **grace**, accounts of **culture** and **work** within the **creation mandate**, and debates on **death** within **creation, fall, and resurrection**. Interlocutors include **Barth** on the christological **imago**, **Aquinas** on intellectual capacities, **Calvin** on sin and renewal, and contemporary figures like **Richard Middleton** and **John Kilner** revisiting the image as **royal vocation** or **destined resemblance**. Throughout, Cortez avoids conflating **biblical theology** with **systematic** claims, yet he argues that canonical judgments about **Jesus** and **new creation** should reset the horizon for every anthropological definition.

#### 4. Retrieval as method: the historical perspective
In **Christological Anthropology in Historical Perspective** (2016), Cortez turns retrieval into pedagogy. The book offers case studies across the tradition to show how christological judgments shape anthropological conclusions. With **Irenaeus**, he highlights **recapitulation** and the growth of humanity to maturity in the Son. From **Athanasius**, he draws a strong account of **deification** as participation in divine life through the incarnate Word, setting an eschatological frame for **imago Dei**. **Gregory of Nyssa** and **Maximus** supply a metaphysics of **desire**, **will**, and **nature** that respects both integrity and transformation. **Aquinas** furnishes the grammar of **form and matter**, **intellect and will**, and the ordering of **grace** to **nature** without collapse, while **Calvin** contributes the axial claims about **union with Christ**, the renewal of the **image**, and the primacy of **Scripture**.

The moderns receive equally close attention. **Luther** exemplifies the depth of **sin** and the reformational focus on **justification**, reorienting anthropology around a cruciform **simul iustus et peccator**. **Barth** re-centers the **imago** in Christ’s history, moving away from structural accounts toward **covenantal** relationality and vocation. Later figures like **Rahner** and **Moltmann** reimagine human transcendence and hope in light of **eschatology**, while analytic and neuroscientific developments force fresh engagement with **consciousness** and **personal identity**. Cortez’s through-line is that a theological account of humanity must be generated within the same dogmatic horizon that confesses **incarnation**, **atonement**, and **resurrection**, thereby guarding against both naturalistic reduction and speculative idealism.

#### 5. Constructive synthesis: ReSourcing Theological Anthropology
The constructive program appears in full in **ReSourcing Theological Anthropology** (2017). Here Cortez argues that a properly evangelical account must start from the **imago Christi**, specify the **imago Dei** as a christic and pneumatological **vocation**, and then work back through **creation** to describe capacities, functions, and relations ordered to that telos. Instead of choosing one historic model, he integrates **substantive** gifts, **functional** rule, and **relational** communion within an explicitly **eschatological** frame: humans are created for **communion with God** and **priestly-royal service** in and through **the Son**, by the **Spirit**. This reframing allows him to resist capacity-based hierarchies that exclude the **disabled**, to rearticulate **gender** as an aspect of created difference ordered to communion without assigning ontological hierarchy, and to reaffirm the centrality of **bodily resurrection** for human fulfillment.

Cortez extends the synthesis to the **mind–body** question. Staying with **holistic dualism**, he contends that the church’s hopes for **personal continuity**, **intermediate state**, and **resurrection** can be held together with robust **embodiment** when the soul is conceptualized as the human **form** of life inseparable from bodily existence in ordinary conditions. Debating **nonreductive physicalism**, he argues that purely physical accounts still struggle with survival and identity across death, though he is careful to note the possibility of divine constraints on metaphysics in light of **resurrection**. Throughout, he exhibits the virtue of **analytic clarity** while drawing on **Athanasius**, **Maximus**, and **Aquinas** to keep modern metaphysics tethered to ecclesial grammar.

#### 6. Focused doctrines: image, sin, redemption, and body
On the **imago Dei**, Cortez’s signature move is to bind image to **Christ** eschatologically and ecclesially. He appreciates **Richard Middleton** for restoring the **royal vocation** of Genesis 1 and **John Kilner** for emphasizing **destined conformity** to Christ, but he resists collapsing the image into either current capacities or bare divine intention. Instead, the **imago** is a created participation and task, grounded in creation yet teleologically ordered to the **imago Christi** realized in **union with Christ**. This allows him to guard the **dignity** of all human persons, including the **unborn**, the **disabled**, and the cognitively impaired, by appeal to vocation and destiny rather than measurable functions.

On **sin** and **redemption**, he follows **Reformation** insights while integrating the patristic sense of **deification** as participation. Human bondage is real and pervasive, yet the **cross** and **resurrection** open a renewed anthropology wherein the Spirit conforms believers to the **Son** in the **church**. The **body** is not an obstacle but the site of sanctification and mission. Regarding **death** and **resurrection**, he rejects any soft-pedaling of the grave’s rupture, but embeds hope in **bodily resurrection** as the non-negotiable fulfillment of human life. The debated **intermediate state** is construed along classic lines of **personal survival** by divine upholding, consonant with **holistic dualism**, without turning that into a competitive alternative to embodied existence.

#### 7. Gender, race, and disability under christological light
Cortez’s chapters on **gender**, **race**, and **disability** apply his method to contested cultural questions. He argues that a christologically normed anthropology affirms **sexed embodiment** as a creational good while refusing to construe masculinity and femininity as ontological hierarchies. He is cautious about grounding **gender** in rigid metaphysical dimorphism detached from **Scripture’s** own teleology of communion and mission; instead he centers differentiated **vocation** within the body of Christ and the common call to holy love. In discussions of **race**, he treats racialization as a fallen social construct, bringing **reconciliation** in Christ to bear on the healing of communities while retaining **creational diversity** as gift. In **disability** theology, he disputes capacity-based definitions of the **image**, defending the full dignity of persons whose capacities differ significantly and mobilizing the church’s **sacramental** practices of inclusion as anticipations of **new creation**.

The through-line remains the same: because **Jesus Christ** is the image and end of humanity, anthropological judgments must be drawn toward his **incarnation**, **cross**, and **resurrection** as the decisive grammar. This does not liquidate **creation order**; rather, it anchors order in its **eschatological** completion, preventing both nature-denying spiritualism and creation-denying progressivism. The upshot is a humane, ecclesially located, and eschatologically confident **evangelical** anthropology open to recent science but governed by **dogmatics**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: analytic, patristic, and reformational
Cortez’s conversation partners span the spectrum. With **Joel B. Green** and **Nancey Murphy**, he debates **nonreductive physicalism**, agreeing on the primacy of **resurrection** but insisting on stronger accounts of **personal continuity**. With **Oliver D. Crisp**, **Joshua R. Farris**, and **John Cooper**, he engages the viability of **substance dualism**, appropriating insights while resisting anthropologies that slight **embodiment**. His appropriation of **Aquinas** and **Maximus** situates him among retrieval theologians who value **hylomorphism** and **virtue** while redescribing them in **christological** terms. With **Barth**, he shares a christocentric **imago**, though he is more intentional about retrieving **creational capacities** and **teleology** to avoid dissolving nature into redemptive history. Debates about **gender** and **disability** place him alongside voices like **John Kilner** and **Richard Middleton**, yet he presses further toward an ecclesially embodied account that refuses both capacity meritocracy and ahistorical essentialism.

His posture toward **science** and **philosophy** is confident but critical. He treats neuroscientific claims about consciousness with respect yet reminds readers that metaphysical conclusions exceed empirical data. He employs **analytic theology** as a tool of clarity not as a replacement for **dogmatic** judgment. And his evangelical instincts keep **Scripture** central, with the creeds and the wider tradition functioning as interpretive anchors. The upshot is a recognizable **evangelical** voice that nonetheless speaks catholic dogmatics with contemporary conceptual dexterity.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Cortez offers salutary emphases and invites principled critique. Positively, his insistence on **bodily resurrection**, his defense of **creational embodiment**, and his refusal to define **imago Dei** by capacities alone resonate with classic **Reformed orthodoxy** that grounds dignity in divine vocation, embeds anthropology within **covenant**, and aims all toward **union with Christ**. His retrieval of **Aquinas** and **Maximus** under a **christological** rule accords with Reformed catholicity, and his analytic sobriety guards speculation. Yet two tensions surface. First, the **christological starting point** risks rhetorical overreach if it eclipses **creation-order** goods inscribed by God in nature and covenant. Reformed divinity, appealing to **general revelation** and **natural law**, would press for stronger accounts of creational **structures** of the **image** such as rationality and righteousness, not merely **eschatological vocation**. Second, Cortez’s **holistic dualism** improves on reductive physicalism but may be judged insufficiently determinate relative to the Westminster Confession’s affirmation that the **souls of men** do subsist after death, a judgment historically cashed out in forms of **substance dualism** consistent with robust **resurrection** hope. A classically Reformed alternative would keep Cortez’s christological and eschatological gains while tightening the **ontology of the soul**, strengthening the **covenantal** frame of the **image** in creation and fall, and ensuring that **union with Christ** fulfills rather than replaces creational **nature** and **law**. In short, Reformed theology can gratefully receive Cortez’s christological retrieval while calibrating it with creational realism and confessional dualism to preserve the full arc of **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, **nature**, and **history**.
