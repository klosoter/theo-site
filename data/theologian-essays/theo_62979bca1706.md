### TITLE
Defending grammatical-historical inerrancy by insisting on the historicity of Genesis 1–11 and resisting allegorization in Old Testament interpretation.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late twentieth and early twenty-first century American **Evangelical** setting shaped by the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)**, postcritical hermeneutics, and culture-war debates over **creation, history, and Scripture**.
- Method marked by **grammatical-historical exegesis**, **authorial intent**, and a single-meaning hermeneutic influenced by **E. D. Hirsch** and the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics (1982)**.
- Key works: **Old Testament Parsing Guide** with W. A. Banks and C. Smith (Moody, 1986; rev. 1990), BibSac essays on the **Song of Songs** and literal interpretation (1998–1999), essays on **Genesis 1–11** and inerrancy in journals and in Mortenson and Ury, eds., **Coming to Grips with Genesis** (2008).
- Central categories: **inerrancy**, **perspicuity of Scripture**, **literal-historical reading**, **Mosaic authorship**, **typology versus allegory**, **single meaning, multiple significance**.
- Main interlocutors: **Origen** and the allegorical tradition; modern evangelicals such as **Gordon Wenham**, **C. John Collins**, **John H. Walton**, and **Peter Enns** on **Genesis**; contemporary readers of **Song of Songs** including **Tremper Longman** and canonical-typological approaches.
- Reformed reception cue: Strong convergence on **biblical authority** and **inerrancy**, tension with some **Reformed redemptive-historical** trajectories on **Genesis days**, **ANE backgrounds**, and **canonical typology**.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and institutional location
Todd S. Beall emerged within late twentieth-century **Evangelical** Old Testament scholarship, teaching for decades at **Capital Bible Seminary** near Washington DC and later engaging broader evangelical institutions in the 2010s. His work bears the imprint of the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy (1978)** and the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Hermeneutics (1982)**, documents that crystallized a movement-wide resolve to defend **plenary, verbal inspiration** and to guard the historical claims of Scripture against the twin pressures of **historical criticism** and **postmodern hermeneutics**. Situated among English-speaking evangelicals concerned with the classroom and the church, Beall cultivated a pedagogical style that married **Hebrew philology** to a robust **grammatical-historical** method, and he persistently framed exegetical debates around **authorial intent** and **perspicuity**. The institutional milieu of **Evangelical Theological Society** meetings and seminary curricula provided his primary arena, not the guild of critical Old Testament scholarship, and he became a recognizable voice defending the historicity of **Genesis 1–11** and resisting **allegorization** in texts such as the **Song of Songs**.

Beall’s historical location also explains his posture toward **Ancient Near Eastern backgrounds** and the legacy of **higher criticism**. He engaged **ANE parallels** with caution, insisting that comparative material never override the Bible’s **self-presentation as history**. He read the dehistoricizing effects of the **documentary hypothesis** and neo-orthodox construals of **truth without factuality** as corrosive of the church’s confession. In this setting his vocation was not to pioneer a new hermeneutical model but to refine and defend the **classic evangelical toolkit**: **lexical-syntactical analysis**, discourse-level attention to **genre**, and principled appeals to **inerrancy** as a hermeneutical guide rail.

#### 2. Method: grammatical-historical discipline ordered by inerrancy
Beall’s method can be summarized by a few axial commitments. First, he defends **grammatical-historical exegesis** that seeks the single, stable **authorial intent** of the text, echoing **E. D. Hirsch’s** distinction between meaning and significance. He insists on the ordinary sense of the text, the sensus literalis, while fully acknowledging **figures, poetry, and metaphor** as elements of that ordinary sense. Second, he argues that **inerrancy** is not a post hoc harmonization strategy but a doctrine that obligates the reader to attend charitably and carefully to **genre markers** and **textual conventions**, so that alleged contradictions in **history or science** usually dissolve under close grammatical scrutiny. Third, he affirms a **single meaning, multiple applications** approach, granting that the Spirit may apply the text broadly without multiplying meanings apart from **canonical warrant**. On typology he is receptive but cautious, allowing only those types that are either embedded in the OT’s own narrative patterns or established by later **inspired** texts, resisting free-form allegory.

These methodological moves are anchored by concrete exegetical practices. Beall drills students in **Hebrew morphology** and **syntax** and recommends reading across the canon to discern repeated **motifs** like creation, covenant, and temple. He stresses narrative signals such as the **toledot** headings in **Genesis**, argues for **Mosaic authorship** of the Pentateuch in line with Jesus’ testimony, and uses the OT’s internal cross-references as interpretive controls. His hermeneutic is thus an ordered hierarchy: **textual grammar** and **genre** first, **canonical context** next, and only then measured conversation with **ANE background** material.

#### 3. Tools for the task: philology as confessional service
Beall is best known among students for the **Old Testament Parsing Guide** coauthored with **William A. Banks** and **Colin Smith**. First published by Moody in 1986 and reissued in expanded form in 1990, the guide offers line-by-line parsing help that keeps the novice in the Hebrew text while resisting overreliance on translation crutches. The project is not merely technical. For Beall, the love of **Hebrew verbs**, stems, and weak-root patterns serves the higher end of guarding **meaning** at the linguistic level. By training seminarians in the nuts and bolts of **morphology** and **syntax**, he aims to erect a bulwark against both **allegorical free play** and **suspicious historicism**. The implicit thesis is theological: confessional **inerrancy** requires sustained exposure to the text’s **philological reality**, not just doctrinal affirmations about Scripture.

This philological bent surfaces in his essays, where appeals to **lexical fields** and discourse features carry arguments about **genre** and **literal sense**. He repeatedly observes that much **hermeneutical skepticism** grows where the details of **Hebrew** are neglected. This insistence that words and clauses matter deeply is the through-line between his parsing work and his programmatic arguments about **Genesis** and the **Song of Songs**.

#### 4. Song of Songs: literal wisdom, not allegory
In a series of **Bibliotheca Sacra** essays in 1998–1999, Beall contended that the **Song of Songs** should be read as **literal love poetry** within Israel’s **wisdom** tradition rather than as an allegory of **Yahweh and Israel** or **Christ and the church**. He sets his reading against the long **allegorical tradition** represented by **Origen** and **Bernard of Clairvaux**, arguing that the book’s sustained erotic imagery, absence of divine names, and sapiential tone resist an immediate mystical or ecclesiological decoding. On his account, the Song’s **metaphorical language** remains literal in reference even when it is richly figurative in expression. Its contribution is to sanctify marital love as a creational good within the canon’s **sapiential theology**.

Beall’s position engages modern interlocutors like **Tremper Longman**, who likewise emphasizes the Song’s **love-poetry** character, while pressing harder than some canonical approaches against reading the book typologically apart from **New Testament warrant**. He acknowledges that **Ephesians 5** establishes a typological relation between human marriage and **Christ and the church**, but he resists retrojecting that specific typology into the **Song of Songs** absent authorial cues. The methodological point is clear: **typology** must be constrained by **textual** and **canonical** signals or else the line between **typology** and **allegory** collapses.

#### 5. Genesis 1–11: history under inerrancy
Beall’s most sustained public labors concern the exegesis of **Genesis 1–11** as real space-time **history**. Across journal articles and in his chapter in Mortenson and Ury’s **Coming to Grips with Genesis** in 2008, he argues that the structure of the creation narrative and the **toledot** formulae present themselves as **historical prose**, not myth or saga. He defends the days of **Genesis 1** as ordinary yom in sequence, contending that the recurring evening-morning refrain, the numbering of days, and the Exodus 20 appeal to the creation week support a literal-week framework. He affirms a **global flood** in **Genesis 6–9**, a historical **Adam and Eve**, and the historicity of **Babel** as dispersing humanity and confounding languages. He regards the genealogies as **historical scaffolding**, not loose theological constructions.

Beall’s exegesis is paired with doctrinal concerns. He argues that **Paul’s** use of Adam in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** presupposes **Adam’s historicity**, such that the gospel’s logic of sin and redemption is jeopardized by dehistoricizing **Genesis**. He responds to claims of ancient Near Eastern parallels, such as **Enuma Elish** and **Atrahasis**, by asserting that **Genesis** presents the polemical correction and true history behind pagan distortions. For Beall, the authority of Scripture in matters of **cosmic origins** and **early human history** is not sectional but comprehensive. The doctrine of **inerrancy** reaches where the text reaches.

#### 6. Inerrancy clarified: genre, figures, and limits
Aware that appeals to **inerrancy** can be caricatured, Beall underscores the need for genre sensitivity. He accepts **phenomenological language** about the sun rising, recognizes **hyperbole** and **poetic parallelism**, and emphasizes that **inerrancy** claims truthfulness in all that the text affirms, not in flatly literalist misreadings. He cites the **Chicago Statement** to clarify that Scripture may employ ordinary language, round numbers, or free citations without error. The upshot is that **inerrancy** does not predetermine one narrow reading; it sets boundaries within which careful **exegesis** proceeds.

At the same time, he resists **limited-inerrancy** proposals that confine biblical truthfulness to soteriological or ethical domains while bracketing **historical** and **cosmological** assertions as culturally conditioned. Beall points to Christ’s and the apostles’ appeals to OT narratives as historical to argue that soteriology itself is historical. Hence, the culture’s pressure points, whether **origins**, **miracles**, or **sexual ethics**, must be met with a confident, text-driven **inerrancy**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates: ANE, science, and hermeneutics
Beall’s public polemics engage a set of influential evangelical scholars. He disputes **John H. Walton’s** cosmic-temple reading of **Genesis 1**, arguing that while temple themes are canonical, Walton’s emphasis risks collapsing the narrative’s **cosmological assertions** into functional claims detached from physical origins. He critiques **C. John Collins’s** analogical-day model as exegetically underdetermined and pastorally unstable when parishioners face **Genesis 1–11** as the Bible’s historical preface. He engages **Gordon Wenham’s** literary sensitivity appreciatively but argues that Wenham’s openness to **mythic** features is an unnecessary concession. He opposes **Peter Enns’s** accommodation model and BioLogos-style **theistic evolution**, contending that these approaches subordinate **Scripture** to contemporary scientific paradigms and fracture **Pauline Adam-Christ** typology.

Even as he disagrees with these figures, Beall’s arguments are not anti-intellectual. He urges sustained study of **ANE literature**, careful distinction between **mythic form** and **historical content**, and charity toward fellow evangelicals. His insistence is that the hermeneutical tail must not wag the dog: **doctrinal confession** and **exegetical discipline** remain the compass when adjudicating new proposals.

#### 8. Pastoral and pedagogical telos: catechizing the church through exegesis
Beall’s influence is as much pedagogical as it is scholarly. In classrooms at **Capital Bible Seminary** and later in broader evangelical settings, he trained pastors to handle the **Hebrew Bible** with confidence. The **Old Testament Parsing Guide** became a staple resource in exegesis courses, while his essays on **Song of Songs** and **Genesis** provided models for preaching difficult texts without surrendering **doctrinal clarity**. He presents hermeneutics as ecclesial catechesis: a way to guard the flock from corrosive **skepticism** and to equip believers to receive **Scripture’s authority** in matters of doctrine and life.

That ecclesial orientation also explains his recurring attention to the **Chicago Statements**, not as naked authority but as consensus distillations of evangelical convictions about **revelation**, **truth**, and **language**. Beall thus occupies the place of a confessional teacher, tending the interface between scholarly debates and pulpit practice. His legacy lies in thousands of sermons and Bible studies shaped by **grammatical-historical** rigor and a settled **inerrancy**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation: agreements and principled tensions
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage point, Beall’s work exhibits deep alignment and a few meaningful tensions. There is strong convergence on **sola Scriptura**, the authority of the **autographa**, and the **inerrancy** codified in the **Chicago Statement**. His defense of **historical Adam**, the unity of **creation-fall-redemption**, and the priority of **authorial intent** comports with the Reformed commitment to Scripture as the covenant document of the **triune God**. His warnings about **reader-centered** and **limited-inerrancy** approaches echo Reformed critiques of **neo-orthodoxy** and **postmodern hermeneutics**.

Tensions arise at the level of hermeneutical application. First, while Beall’s literal-week reading of **Genesis 1** is a permissible Reformed view, many in the Westminster stream have adopted the **framework hypothesis** or **analogical days** via **Meredith Kline**, aiming to preserve the text’s historical truth while attending to its **literary structure** and **sabbath theology**. A WTS evaluation might judge Beall’s case insufficiently attentive to redemptive-historical shaping and to the Creator-creature analogies signaled by the text’s **literary architecture**. Second, Beall’s reticence toward **canonical typology** outside explicit NT warrant may seem too restrictive. Reformed exegesis, in the line of **Geerhardus Vos**, practices a robust, authorially grounded **typology** that perceives Christ-centered trajectories in wisdom literature, including the **Song of Songs**, without collapsing into **allegory**. Third, on **ANE contexts**, Beall’s guarded posture can be sharpened by a covenantal epistemology that uses **general revelation** and providence to situate Scripture’s polemics with confidence, rather than defensively. None of these tensions are fatal. They suggest that Beall’s strengths in **philology**, **inerrancy**, and **grammatical-historical** clarity can be complemented by a more explicit **covenantal, redemptive-historical** hermeneutic, preserving his insistence on **history** while enriching canonical theology and pastoral proclamation.
