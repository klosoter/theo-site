### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
James N. Anderson belongs to the generation that normalized **analytic theology** within evangelical and Reformed institutions, working from **Reformed Theological Seminary, Charlotte** in the 2000s and 2010s, while drawing on the presuppositional heritage of **Cornelius Van Til** and the epistemological resources of **Alvin Plantinga**. His early scholarly identity was forged in the crucible of questions about **rationality and revelation**: can **classical Christian doctrines** such as the **Trinity** and the **Incarnation** be retained with intellectual integrity under **classical logic** when they present as paradoxical? This focus situated him within late modern debates on **religious epistemology**, **philosophy of language**, and **metaphysics**, alongside the broader evangelical turn toward **analytic metaphysics** of **divine attributes**. He endorses a methodological pairing: **presuppositional-transcendental argumentation** in the line of **Van Til** and **Frame**, and **externalist warrant** in the line of **Plantinga**, while insisting on the **Creator-creature distinction** as regulative for all theological predication.

This methodological pairing yields a coherent structure. Scripture functions as **principium cognoscendi externum**, the external cognitive principle, while the **Spirit** secures **warrant** internally in the mode of a **sensus divinitatis** and through the self-attesting nature of **divine revelation**. Anderson insists on *fides quaerens intellectum* that is governed by **analogia fidei**, so that explanation is constrained by exegesis and confessional boundaries. He resists any retreat to **paraconsistent logic** or to the **analogia entis** of Roman Catholic metaphysics, arguing instead for classical laws of thought under an explicitly **analogical theology** that honors the **incomprehensibility of God** without collapsing into skepticism. The result is a chastened rationality that can countenance **warranted paradox** while rejecting true contradiction.

#### 2. Paradox and Christian dogma
Anderson's signature work, **Paradox in Christian Theology** (2007), tackles the alleged internal incoherence of **Trinitarian** and **Christological** orthodoxy. He distinguishes between genuine contradictions and **apparent contradictions**, arguing that the latter can be rationally believed when they are the deliverances of an authoritative **divine revelation** and when no successful **defeater** is in hand. The central claim is that key dogmas present as paradoxes given our epistemic limitations and the **Creator-creature distinction**, not because they breach the **law of non-contradiction**. The doctrines of **one God in three persons** and of the **one person with two natures** are not revised but carefully restated through conceptual tools that attend to **category distinctions**, **sense-reference differentiation**, and **analogical predication**.

This defense uses the machinery of contemporary **epistemology**. Anderson draws on **defeasible reasoning**, **rational commitment under epistemic defeat**, and **externalist warrant** to explain how believers may rationally trust **biblical testimony** even when they cannot produce a fully transparent model of **homoousios** or **dyothelitism**. He distinguishes **merely apparent contradictions** from **strong paradoxes**, noting that the former often trade on equivocation, category mistakes, or illicit inference. Where the paradox cannot yet be resolved into a perspicuous model, Anderson invokes **mysterianism** of a qualified sort: given the authoritative source of the doctrines and the broader coherence of the **Christian worldview**, believers may be rational to accept the deliverances pending future conceptual clarification.

#### 3. Trinity, Incarnation, and models
Within **Trinitarian theology**, Anderson canvasses analytic options, engaging **relative identity** proposals while guarding classical commitments to **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability**. He is reluctant to adopt relative identity or paraconsistency, arguing instead that properly distinguished **predication** and **relations of origin** can dispel the charge of formal contradiction. On **Christology**, Anderson engages **Thomas V. Morris** and two-minds accounts that protect **anhypostasia-enhypostasia**, affirming that the **one person** of the Son subsists in two complete **natures**, divine and human, without confusion and without division. He argues that paradox accusations often stem from illicitly transferring properties across the **communicatio idiomatum** in a way that violates Chalcedonian guardrails. The result is a cumulative case for the rationality of **Nicene-Chalcedonian orthodoxy** under **classical logic** without succumbing to **kenoticism** or speculative metaphysics.

A crucial subtheme is the status of **theological language**. In articles and essays on **religious language**, Anderson appropriates **Van Til's analogical reasoning** and **Calvin's accommodation** to explain how true predication about God is possible without breaching **divine incomprehensibility**. He rejects univocity in the sense of creaturely predicates mapping one-to-one onto **divine perfections**, yet he just as firmly rejects equivocity, grounding analogical truth in the **Creator-creature relation** established by **revelation**. Here his defense of **apparent contradiction** functions as a guardrail: analogical language may leave unresolved tensions at the level of creaturely conceptualization while preserving truth at the level of **revelatory content**.

#### 4. Logic, abstracta, and divine conceptualism
In the widely discussed essay **The Lord of Non-Contradiction** (2011), coauthored with **Greg Welty**, Anderson advances an argument from the nature of **logic** to the existence of **God**. The form is recognizably **transcendental**: the universal, necessary, and immaterial features of the **laws of logic** require an ontological ground that is personal, necessary, and immaterial, best explained as **divine conceptualism**. On this Augustinian strategy, truths of logic are not free-floating abstracta but are identical to or grounded in **divine ideas**. This move addresses the **Benacerraf problem** for logical and mathematical knowledge by locating truth-makers in the **mind of God**, thereby preserving the normative authority and necessity of logic while avoiding a Platonist metaphysics at odds with **divine aseity**.

The proposal threads a delicate needle in **classical theism**. By rooting **abstract objects** in **divine cognition**, Anderson aims to protect **divine simplicity** and **unqualified sovereignty** over all that exists *ad extra*. He argues that **necessary truths** do not compete with God but are grounded in God, preserving **tota causa** of creaturely being without positing a realm of independent necessary entities. Critics press possible tensions between **divine simplicity** and a robust **noetic plurality** in God, but Anderson insists that the **simplicity-complexity** contrast is not between God and concepts but between **God's essence** and all composite creatures, and that identifying logical laws with **divine self-knowledge** coheres with **Augustine** and **Aquinas** as well as with **Reformed scholastics** like **Turretin** on the **divine ideas**.

#### 5. Worldview analysis, transcendental argument, and apologetics
Beyond academic monographs, Anderson has popularized **worldview analysis** and **transcendental apologetics** through **What’s Your Worldview?** (2014) and **Why Should I Believe Christianity?** (2016). The former is an interactive taxonomy that guides readers through options such as **theism**, **naturalism**, **pantheism**, **pluralism**, **relativism**, and **nihilism**, showing the internal pressures and self-referential vulnerabilities of rival outlooks. The latter deploys a cumulative case framed presuppositionally: the intelligibility of **logic**, **morality**, **induction**, **personal identity**, and **science** calls for the triune **God of Scripture**, with **Scripture** functioning as the ultimate **norming norm**. The style is analytic in clarity yet Van Tilian in thrust: the argument seeks not merely probabilistic support but the **transcendental necessity** of the Christian worldview as the condition for the possibility of rational discourse.

This approach imports epistemic categories from **Reformed epistemology**. Drawing from **Plantinga's** notions of **proper basicality** and **warrant**, Anderson argues that Christian belief can be rational, warranted, and even knowledgeable without propositional evidence that meets the standards of **internalist foundationalism**. Yet he also offers **public reasons** and addresses **defeaters**, interacting with critics such as **J. L. Mackie** and **Graham Oppy**. The apologetic upshot is a blend of **transcendental argument** and **cumulative case**, unified by the claim that any coherent account of reality presupposes the **triune God** revealed in **Scripture** and confessed in **Reformed orthodoxy**.

#### 6. Providence, freedom, and evil
In essays and shorter works, Anderson defends **compatibilist freedom** and addresses the **problem of evil** within a **Calvinist** framework. He draws on **Paul Helm** to argue that **divine sovereignty** and **human responsibility** are not contraries but operate at distinct explanatory levels, using *primary-secondary causation* and the **decree-concurrence** distinction. He critiques **Molinism** by pressing the **grounding objection** to **middle knowledge**, contending that counterfactuals of libertarian freedom lack truth-makers independent of divine decree and thus fail to deliver the control Molinists seek while honoring **aseity** and **simplicity**. In place of Molinism, Anderson offers a compatibilist model in which **providence** encompasses all things without violating **creaturely will**, preserving **accountability** through the alignment of will and nature.

On **theodicy**, Anderson tends toward an **epistemic defense** rather than a systematizing **greater-good theodicy**, appealing to the limits of human insight given the **Creator-creature distinction** and analogical knowledge. He appropriates **skeptical theism** to block global evidential arguments from evil, while maintaining biblically grounded goods such as **God's glory**, **redemptive history**, and **Christological theodicy** centered on the **cross**. The same calibrated appeal to **warranted mystery** that marks his work on **paradox** appears here: we can know enough from **revelation** to trust the **goodness** and **wisdom** of God without claiming exhaustive insight into every instance of suffering.

#### 7. Scripture, language, and method in practice
As a theologian in the **Westminster** and **RTS** orbit, Anderson operates with **sola Scriptura** as the dogmatic **principium**. The **self-authenticating Scripture**, illumined by the **Spirit**, sets the terms for all doctrinal construction. His methodological essays elaborate how **systematic theology** draws on *loci* and confessional norms under **biblical-theological** control while making explanatory use of analytic tools like **modal logic**, **mereology**, and **semantics**. He maintains **classical logic** and a parsimonious ontology, rejecting appeals to **paraconsistency** or **dialetheism** in theology. This is not an anti-philosophical posture; rather, it is a disciplined enlistment of philosophy under **the ministerial use of reason**, calibrated by **Reformed orthodoxy**.

His writings on **religious language** defend the intelligibility and truth of **theological predication** through **analogical discourse**, treating the **incomprehensibility of God** as a positive dogma that disciplines reason. He highlights how linguistic tensions often masquerade as logical contradictions. Careful attention to **sense and reference**, to the scope of **quantifiers**, and to the difference between **personal** and **natural** predication can resolve many puzzles in **Trinity** and **Incarnation** before reaching for paradox. Where tensions remain, **apparent contradiction** retains its function as an epistemic category that honors **revelation** without corroding **consistency**.

#### 8. Public-facing pedagogy and ecclesial location
Anderson's dual calling as scholar and apologist is visible in his accessible volumes like **What’s Your Worldview?** (2014) and **Why Should I Believe Christianity?** (2016), as well as in essays for venues like **Themelios** and **Reformation21** where he engages **New Atheism**, **religious pluralism**, and **Islam**. He is ordained in a conservative **Presbyterian** tradition and teaches within confessional **seminary** life, anchoring his analytic work in **catechesis** and **pastoral** application. This ecclesial embedding distinguishes his analytic commitments from purely speculative projects: doctrines are handled as **churchly dogma**, not simply as problems for metaphysics. His pedagogy models **worldview comparison** that is charitable yet relentless in testing for **internal coherence**, while his apologetic posture remains **presuppositional**, maintaining that all human knowing is covenantally situated before the **triune Lord**.

The result is a recognizable contribution to the contemporary **Reformed** scene: a bridge between **Van Tilian** presuppositionalism and mainstream **analytic philosophy**, a defense of **classical theism** that declines trendy revisions, and a posture of **intellectual chastity** before **mystery** that nonetheless pursues maximal clarity. His collaborative work on **divine conceptualism** gives a distinctively **Augustinian-Reformed** answer to modern worries about **abstract objects**, while his handling of doctrinal paradoxes exemplifies how **Scripture**, **confession**, and **logic** can be held together without compromise.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** standpoint, Anderson's synthesis yields significant strengths. His insistence on **classical logic**, the **Creator-creature distinction**, and **analogical predication** guards orthodoxy against both **rationalist domestication** and **irrationalist capitulation**. His use of **externalist warrant** resists evidentialist strictures that undervalue **Scripture** as **principium**, and his **transcendental** framing honors the **covenantal** conditions of knowledge. Critically, however, questions remain. The category of **warranted paradox** can be pastorally wise yet must be policed lest it license doctrinal sloppiness; the tradition's own resources in **precise metaphysics** of **simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **processions** may often diminish the scope of paradox without abandoning **mystery**. Further, **divine conceptualism** faces the perennial challenge of aligning a robust account of **divine ideas** with **divine simplicity** and **immutability**; Reformed scholastic strategies that locate the many in the one via **virtual distinctions** should be explicitly integrated to forestall charges of conceptual plurality in God. Finally, while the **transcendental argument** is powerful, it courts the standard objection of underdetermination unless tethered explicitly to **covenant-historical revelation** in **Christ** and **Scripture**. The best Reformed alternative is not to abandon Anderson's synthesis but to deepen it by sharpening **metaphysical grammar** where paradox is invoked, by aligning **divine conceptualism** with classical **simplicity** via scholastic distinctions, and by ensuring that transcendental claims are exegetically saturated and **christologically** centered.
