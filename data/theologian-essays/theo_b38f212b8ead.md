### ESSAY
José van Dijck has become a central interpreter of the contemporary **platform society**, arguing across a series of influential books that **connective media** have migrated from peripheral channels to core **infrastructures** that shape memory, communication, and civic life. Trained in literary and media studies and working within the Dutch research university system, she emerged in the 2000s as a leading voice in **critical media theory** just as digitization, mobile computing, and **datafication** were reconfiguring culture. In a European context marked by **GDPR**, debates over **digital sovereignty**, and the defense of a historically robust **public sector**, she positioned her scholarship between descriptive analysis of **platform mechanics** and normative argument for **public values** that should govern connective infrastructures. Her trajectory runs from the study of **mediated memory** to a full-blown critique of **platformization** as the institutional reordering of societal domains by corporate ecosystems.

Van Dijck’s method is an articulate hybrid of **Science and Technology Studies** with **media sociology**, characterized by close empirical attention to **platform interfaces**, **algorithms**, and **business models**, yet oriented toward the ethical grammar of **public values** such as democracy, equality, and privacy. Her conceptual stance is neither technological determinism nor sheer social construction. Rather, she emphasizes **sociotechnical co-production**, where **infrastructures** crystallize values and, in turn, enable or foreclose civic practices. This mid-level, institutional analysis refuses optimistic **digital utopianism** and also resists fatalist **technopessimism** by mapping how **platform logics** work and how policy, engineering, and culture might reconfigure them. The lexicon that recurs throughout her work includes **datafication** as the rendering of life into quantifiable data, **platformization** as the spread of platform logics into public sectors, and **ecosystems** to highlight the interdependencies among **devices, data flows, interfaces, and monetization**.

The first major arc in van Dijck’s oeuvre treats the reshaping of memory and identity by **connective media**. In **Mediated Memory in the Digital Age (2007)** she argues that memory practices are never merely private, because they are structured by **media technologies**, **archives**, and **cultural rituals**. Personal photographs, blogs, and later social networks become nodes in **collective memory**, linking **biography** to **infrastructure**. The book’s central contribution is to move beyond content to the **mediational form**, demonstrating how **storage, retrieval, and circulation** alter what counts as memory. Theologically adjacent themes are evident: questions about **narrative identity**, **testimony**, and the authority of **cultural memory** are recast as problems of **infrastructural affordances** and institutional mediation. While not using theological vocabulary, the work renders explicit how contemporary rememberings are governed by **technical protocols** and **platform governance** that pattern communal recollection.

The second arc consolidates her analytic vocabulary of **connective media** and **social media logic**. The 2013 article **Understanding Social Media Logic** co-authored with **Thomas Poell** isolates core principles such as **programmability**, **popularity**, **connectivity**, and **datafication**, showing how these principles structure visibility, attention, and social ties across platforms. In the same year, **The Culture of Connectivity (2013)** provides a critical history of major platforms such as **Facebook**, **Twitter**, **YouTube**, **Flickr**, and **Wikipedia**, situating them at the intersection of **technological design**, **commercial imperatives**, and **user practices**. The book’s organizing claim is that a distinct **connectivity culture** has emerged, one that normalizes the translation of sociality into **metrics**, and the monetization of **attention** through **advertising** and **surveillance**. By treating platforms as **institutional actors** rather than neutral conduits, van Dijck reveals how **algorithmic selection** and **platform governance** produce the very publics they purport to merely host.

The third arc is a full institutional turn in **The Platform Society: Public Values in a Connective World (2018)**, written with **Thomas Poell** and **Martijn de Waal**. Here van Dijck extends her analysis from media to the **platformization of public sectors**: news, education, health care, transport, and urban services. The book’s thesis is stark: privately owned **platform ecosystems** have become the infrastructural backbone of essential services, thereby relocating **public values** into corporate architectures oriented by **growth**, **extraction**, and **market expansion**. Key mechanisms are singled out: **datafication** as socio-technical practice, **commodification** of user activity and civic data, and **selection** where algorithmic curation substitutes for editorial or civic deliberation. By analyzing sectoral case studies, the authors demonstrate how platforms entangle themselves with **state functions**, outsource **governance** to **terms of service**, and reconfigure **citizens** into **users**. The language of **public values** functions here as a normative counterweight, proposing that democratic polities can and should articulate and enforce values in infrastructure.

Van Dijck’s conceptual architecture is anchored in a network of interlocutors. From **Jürgen Habermas**, she inherits the analytic of the **public sphere** while insisting that a mass-mediated, later platform-mediated public sphere is fundamentally transformed by **algorithmic intermediation**. From **Bruno Latour** and **Actor-Network Theory**, she borrows the insistence that **nonhuman actors** and **technical artifacts** are integral to social action, reframing infrastructures as **actants** that co-determine practices. From **Manuel Castells**, the **network society** becomes the macro-background against which **platform power** emerges. In conversation with **Tarleton Gillespie** on **platform governance**, **danah boyd** on **networked publics**, **Shoshana Zuboff** on **surveillance capitalism**, and **Nick Srnicek** on **platform capitalism**, van Dijck positions her contribution not as a rival grand theory but as a mediating diagnosis attentive to **institutional design** and **policy leverage points**. The shared horizon is clear: the digital economy is a contest over **infrastructural power**, and culture is remade within **datafied** channels.

Crucial to her approach is the European attention to **public institutions**, **law**, and **regulatory capacity**. Van Dijck’s term **public values** does not simply denote private moral preferences but names a polity’s legally and culturally articulated goods, including **privacy**, **fairness**, **access**, **pluralism**, **transparency**, and **accountability**. These values, she argues, must be encoded into **technical standards**, **procurement regimes**, and **platform architectures** if they are to endure. The book’s case studies show that without intentional governance, **lock-in effects** and **network externalities** concentrate power and marginalize **civic oversight**. Thus, van Dijck’s method fuses **diagnosis** with **design imagination**, calling for **public digital infrastructures**, **interoperability mandates**, and **data trusts** that redistribute informational power and restore **democratic accountability**. Her analysis assumes that infrastructure is not merely a technical base but a **moral order** concretized in code, contracts, and interfaces.

Behind these arguments is a thick account of **media power**. Van Dijck distinguishes between rhetorical public claims and **infrastructural domination**, urging analysts to follow **data flows**, **APIs**, and **cloud dependencies** to see where authority actually lies. Platforms shape what can be said and to whom through **curation algorithms**, **recommendation systems**, and **moderation protocols**, thereby exercising a form of **procedural sovereignty** eclipsing traditional **state regulation**. She stresses that these systems are not transparent marketplaces of ideas but **designed attention economies** with structural incentives for **engagement maximization**. The result is a redefinition of citizenship as **participation within proprietary environments**, where **terms of service** supplant **public law** and **metrics** substitute for civic deliberation. The conceptual pairing of **connectivity** with **commodification** thus yields her core critique: a civic sphere cannot be sustained on the basis of **extractive architectures**.

If early work mapped the transformation of memory and later work charted the colonization of public sectors, the thread unifying van Dijck’s corpus is her insistence that culture is infrastructural. The notion of **infrastructural imaginaries** is pivotal: public debates carry pictures of what infrastructure is and does, and these pictures steer investments and norms. By exposing the imaginaries that legitimize the dominance of a few **Big Tech ecosystems** across domains, van Dijck invites a cultural politics oriented to **institutional pluralism** and the creation of **public alternatives**. Pedagogically, her analyses function as mid-level theories that help educators, journalists, health administrators, and city planners to inspect **platform dependencies**, identify **value conflicts**, and pursue **governance options**. Her scholarship thus shifts the question from whether technology is good or bad to how **institutions** embed or resist **platform logics**.

In her public role, including service as **President of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (2015–2018)**, van Dijck amplified a European discourse about **digital commons**, **research integrity**, and **knowledge infrastructures**. This leadership contextualizes her academic claims: she is not only diagnosing trends but convening **interdisciplinary expertise** to shape **policy**. The emphasis on **evidence-based recommendations**, **cross-sector collaboration**, and **normative clarity** reflects a scholar who moves readily between empirical case study and **civic argument**. The methodological upshot is a model for scholars working at the interface of **technology studies** and **public ethics**, where arguments about **public values** are not appended to technical analyses but are integral to the very description of **infrastructures**.

Theologically, van Dijck’s work can be read as an unintentional anthropology and political theology of the digital age. Her account of **datafication** reframes the question of human personhood as a struggle over **data doubles**, with dignity and agency mediated by **platform ontologies** that privilege calculable behaviors. Her critique of **platformization** surfaces the problem of **institutional sovereignty**, asking which communities rightly govern **education**, **health**, and **news** and by what norms. The language of **public values** functions as a secular shorthand for shared goods ordered to the commonweal, implicitly raising questions about the sources of normativity, the limits of commodification, and the moral status of **knowledge infrastructures**. By tracing the cultivation of memory, identity, and public judgment inside designed systems, she provides theological readers with a concrete map of where **cultural liturgies** now occur: at interfaces, in metrics, and through code.

A concise Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation must register both gratitude and critique. Positively, van Dijck’s exposure of **infrastructural power**, **datafication**, and the erosion of **public values** offers common-grace insight into how contemporary principalities operate, furnishing pastors, institutions, and magistrates with diagnostic clarity. Yet her reliance on procedural **public reason** and secularized **public values** risks bracketing **special revelation** as the principled norm for defining justice, personhood, and institutional ends. Classical Reformed theology would insist that the noetic effects of **sin** pervade **algorithms**, **markets**, and **policies**, that **idolatry** underwrites engagement-maximizing architectures, and that civic goods must be ordered by the **law of God** revealed in Scripture and creation. Where she recommends technocratic recalibration and European regulatory repair, a Reformed alternative would add a thicker account of **sphere-specific responsibility** under divine sovereignty, the primacy of **family, church, and magistrate** over commercial platforms within their proper competences, and a call to repentance for disordered loves encoded as code. Her admirable policy imagination could be deepened by a doctrinally grounded anthropology of the **imago Dei**, a covenantal account of **authority** and **accountability**, and a Christocentric telos for cultural labor that refuses the neutrality of **public reason** while still practicing prudence within plural polities.
