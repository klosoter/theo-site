### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to method
Craig A. Blaising emerged in the crucible of late twentieth-century **evangelical theology**, when **classical dispensationalism** faced scrutiny from **covenant theology** and from its own reformers. At **Dallas Theological Seminary**, he absorbed the legacy of **Charles Ryrie** and **John Walvoord** while also engaging the canonical and **redemptive-historical** turn associated with **George Eldon Ladd** and, in different ways, **Brevard S. Childs**. The intellectual setting featured debates over the **historical-grammatical** method, the status of **typology**, and the relation of **Israel** and **church** within the one **oikonomia** of God. Blaising’s professional trajectory through faculty roles at Dallas and later leadership at **Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary** positioned him to synthesize exegetical, historical, and systematic concerns. The point of departure for his theological identity was a conviction that the **kingdom of God** is the unifying thread of Scripture, but that this kingdom unfolds in a genuinely progressive **economy** whose stages should not be collapsed by an undisciplined canonical reading nor fragmented by rigid proof-text literalism.

Blaising’s methodological hallmark is **complementary hermeneutics**, a disciplined account of **canonical intertextuality** that seeks to preserve the integrity of **authorial intent** in earlier texts while acknowledging that later revelation can extend, deepen, and specify those earlier meanings. Against both the charge that dispensationalists ignore the **NT use of the OT** and the impulse to let the **New Testament** overwrite Old Testament referents, he argues for a canonically sequenced unity, a kind of evangelical *Aufhebung* in which the earlier is taken up and filled out without being annulled. The resulting posture combines **grammatical-historical exegesis**, attention to **type–antitype** relations, and a commitment to **inaugurated eschatology** under the lordship of the **risen Davidic Messiah**.

#### 2. Programmatic works and the constructive agenda
Two volumes set the agenda. In **Dispensationalism, Israel and the Church: The Search for Definition** (1992), edited with **Darrell L. Bock**, Blaising convened voices to reassess **dispensational identity**, mapping the move from classical to **progressive** constructions. The next year, in **Progressive Dispensationalism** (1993), Blaising and Bock produced the movement’s programmatic textbook. There they articulated the core thesis: Scripture narrates one unified **plan of God** culminating in **Christ’s kingdom**, with discrete **dispensations** understood as historical economies of divine administration that progressively disclose covenantal promises. Crucially, they reframed the older **Israel–church** dichotomy into an already-not yet unity-in-distinction, affirmed the present reality of **Christ’s Davidic reign**, and urged a **canonical** rather than atomistic hermeneutic. Later contributions in **Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond** (1999) and **Three Views on the Rapture** (2010) showcased Blaising’s willingness to stage his views in direct conversation with **amillennial**, **postmillennial**, and **posttribulational** alternatives, sharpening his commitment to a **premillennial** and typically **pretribulational** eschatology that is exegetically grounded and theologically integrated.

Methodologically, these works stress that **progressive revelation** introduces **complementary fulfillment**: later texts may add a universal horizon to a particular promise or disclose a heavenly stage of a royal reality, while still preserving the earlier promise’s terrestrial specification. This is the crux of Blaising’s protest against both a strict **sensus plenior** that decouples later meaning from earlier intent and a flat literalism that refuses the **NT’s christological rereading**. The inevitable test case is the **Davidic covenant** and the **land** promise, where Blaising contends that the **New Testament** reveals an inaugurated heavenly enthronement of the Son of David without exhausting the covenant’s terrestrial scope articulated in **2 Samuel 7** and **Psalms**.

#### 3. Kingdom, Davidic kingship, and inaugurated eschatology
Blaising’s central doctrinal contribution is his account of **inaugurated eschatology** as applied to **Davidic kingship**. With **George Eldon Ladd**, he affirms that the **kingdom of God** is both already and not yet, present in the **resurrection** and **ascension** of Jesus, operative through the **Spirit**, and awaiting a climactic parousia. Yet, unlike many **amillennial** construals, he argues that **Acts 2** and **Hebrews** bear witness to a real, royal enthronement that is Davidic in character, such that the **Davidic covenant** is presently operative in heaven. The not-yet dimension, however, is not merely the general resurrection and final state; it includes a messianic administration in history, a **millennial kingdom** in which the **nations** and **Israel** experience the restorative breadth of God’s promises. This two-stage kingship embeds a **canonical promise-plan** that moves from **Abrahamic** election through **Mosaic** administration to **Davidic** royal consolidation and **new covenant** renewal, all fulfilled in **Christ** but in a temporally stratified way.

Key to this is Blaising’s use of **complementary fulfillment**: a promise about **Zion** and the **land** can be lifted into a cosmic and ecclesial horizon in the **New Testament** while retaining its original geopolitical significance in the not-yet. The church participates in the **new covenant** blessings and the **Spirit’s** down payment, but the political dimension of **Davidic rule** in the land is not thereby canceled. Blaising appeals to texts like **Luke-Acts**, **Romans 11**, and **Revelation 20** to argue for both an already universalizing trajectory and a preserved particularity. The kingdom is thus christologically centered, pneumatologically mediated, ecclesially experienced, and eschatologically destined for historical manifestation before its consummation in the **new creation**.

#### 4. Israel and the church: unity, distinction, and Romans 9–11
On the contested question of **Israel and the church**, Blaising rejects the classical dispensational notion of two separate peoples of God while also resisting a **covenant theology** tendency to dissolve Israel into a purely typological cipher. He maintains the **one people of God** thesis, grounded in union with **Christ**, while affirming an eschatological identity for **ethnic Israel** that persists within that one people in the **messianic kingdom**. **Romans 9–11** is programmatic: the **olive tree** metaphor signifies a single covenantal root with branches broken off and grafted in, while **Romans 11:26** promises a future salvation of Israel that is neither trivial nor merely nominal. The integrity of Old Testament **land** and **national** promises is preserved within a widened horizon in which **Gentiles** are coheirs, not replacements.

This move entails a recalibration of the **new covenant**. For Blaising, the **new covenant** is inaugurated with the church in **Pentecost**, providing forgiveness and the **Spirit**, but its promised national dimensions for **Israel** await corporate realization. The **church** is not a parenthesis but the firstfruits; the **mystery** theme in Paul denotes unveiled continuity rather than a rupture. The ecclesial present is thus eschatologically charged, yet the canonical storyline renders Israel’s future more than a vestigial reminiscence. Here Blaising differentiates progressive dispensationalism from both classical **replacement** narratives and from narrow two-track soteriologies, preserving **christological exclusivity** while affirming eschatological plurality within unity.

#### 5. Dispensations, covenants, and the shape of biblical theology
Blaising retools the language of **dispensations** as historical economies rather than airtight epochs, aligning them with the sequence of **covenants** that structure the canon. The **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, **Davidic**, and **new covenant** are not competing salvific regimes but successive administrations of the one **plan of God**. The **Mosaic law** has a covenantal-historical status that gives way to **new covenant** realities, yet moral and creational norms persist in virtue of **creation order** and **wisdom**. By locating **dispensations** within covenantal history, Blaising attempts to overcome the older charge that dispensationalism is indifferent to **biblical theology**. He emphasizes **promise and fulfillment**, **type and antitype**, and **canonical progression** across both Testaments.

This program reflects dialogue with **Walter Kaiser** on the **promise-plan of God** and engagement with **G. K. Beale** and **Vern Poythress** on the **temple**, **new creation**, and **typology**. Blaising adopts a high view of **typological escalation** but refuses to let escalation erase original referents. His account of **canonical coherence** avoids a free-floating **sensus plenior** by insisting that complementary additions must be textually anchored and theologically warranted by the **Christ-event**. The upshot is a mediating path: covenantal unity without homogenization, progressive diversity without fragmentation.

#### 6. Millennial and rapture debates: locating progressive premillennialism
In public debates such as **Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond** (1999), Blaising represents a **progressive premillennialism** that is neither historic premillennialism in the **Ladd** mold nor classical dispensational premillennialism. He affirms a literal **millennium** in **Revelation 20**, linked to the fulfillment of **Davidic** and **land** promises, yet insists that the **church** is the eschatological people of God participating fully in that reign. On the timing of the **rapture**, Blaising in **Three Views on the Rapture** (2010) defends a nuanced **pretribulation** view grounded in intra-canonical exegesis of **1 Thessalonians 4–5**, **1 Corinthians 15**, and the structure of **Danielic** and **Apocalyptic** expectation. He frames the rapture debate within his broader hermeneutic: the question is how the canonical sequence orders tribulation, wrath, and deliverance without pitting texts against each other.

Noteworthy is Blaising’s restraint on speculative millennial details. He resists imposing a full civil blueprint of the kingdom, focusing instead on the royal, priestly, and international dimensions already present in **Isaiah**, **Ezekiel**, and **Zechariah** and refracted in the **New Testament**. While some dispensationalists have argued for **memorial sacrifices** in a restored **temple**, Blaising prioritizes the christological finality of **atonement** and treats cultic imagery typologically within a real historical reign. The decisive point is the coherence of **inaugurated eschatology** with a historical, terrestrial phase of the kingdom prior to the **new heavens and new earth**.

#### 7. The NT use of the OT and complementary fulfillment
The nerve center of Blaising’s proposal remains the **NT use of the OT**. His **complementary hermeneutics** contends that when the **New Testament** cites or alludes to **Old Testament** texts, it may reveal deeper or wider applications that complement rather than cancel the earlier horizon. For example, **Peter’s** use of **Joel 2** at **Pentecost** signifies both present **Spirit** outpouring and a foretaste of apocalyptic consummation; **Hebrews** applies **Psalm 110** to Christ’s heavenly priest-king role, inaugurating the **Davidic** and **Melchizedekian** offices together without reducing future terrestrial implications. This approach recognizes that divine authorship guarantees a coherent canon, but it disciplines that coherence through the sequence of **revelation**.

In dialog with **Brevard Childs** on the **canonical approach**, Blaising affirms that meaning stabilizes in the final form of the canon but insists that intertextual development be historically tracked. His method thus pushes against an a priori **amillennial** compression of promises into the church age and against a **proof-text** literalism that refuses the **christological recentering** of the story. The net effect is a hermeneutic that tries to be faithful to both the **human authors** situated in their historical contexts and the **divine author** who unites the scriptural drama in **Christ**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and institutional leadership
Blaising’s constructive work developed in constant debate with both **dispensational** and **covenantal** theologians. Within dispensationalism, he revises **Ryrie’s** emphases on **consistent literalism** and the two peoples of God, while honoring the movement’s attention to **Israel’s** promises. With **Robert L. Saucy**, he shares the progressive impulse but advances a more canonical structuring. With **Ladd** and **historic premillennialists**, he embraces **inaugurated eschatology** but pushes for stronger continuity with **Israel’s** covenants. With **Kaiser**, he underscores the **promise-plan** but nuances how promises escalate. In debate with **Poythress**, **Beale**, and **Hoekema**, he defends the not-yet national and territorial dimensions without ceding christocentric control.

Institutionally, Blaising’s roles at **Dallas** and **Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary** amplified his influence in **Southern Baptist** and broader **evangelical** circles. Through classroom, conference, and editorial work, he shaped a generation of students toward a **biblical-theological** sensibility that refuses the impasse of polemical camps. His essays and chapters, including those in **The People, the Land, and the Future of Israel** (2014), keep returning to the signature themes: the **kingdom of God**, the **Davidic covenant**, and the integrity of **canonical sequence** for doctrinal construction.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis: Christology, ecclesiology, and mission
Theologically, Blaising integrates **Christology**, **ecclesiology**, and **missiology** under the rubric of the **kingdom**. Christ is the **Davidic Son** enthroned already; the **church** is the Spirit-indwelt community experiencing new covenant blessings and anticipating royal consummation; the **mission** of the church is to bear witness among the **nations** to the inaugurated reign that will one day reorder public life under Messiah’s rule. This synthesis emphasizes the **priest-king** identity of Jesus from **Psalm 110**, the **holy nation** identity of the church in **1 Peter 2**, and the **grafting** dynamics of **Romans 11**. The practical upshot is a robustly biblical eschatology that dignifies present ecclesial life as eschatological participation and renders hope concrete in history without collapsing it into secular progress.

Blaising’s systematic posture is doxological: God’s **glory** is manifest in the unity of his **plan** across dispensations, covenants, and peoples, climaxing in the unveiled reign of the **Lamb**. The continuity of **grace** and the constancy of **Christ’s** mediatorial kingship furnish the metaphysical stability of the plan, while the historical diversity of administrations secures exegetical and pastoral realism. The distinctive contribution is to yoke **dispensational** attentiveness to Israel’s story to a **canonical** and **christocentric** reading that speaks fluently to the academy and the church.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage shaped by **Vosian redemptive-historical** theology, Blaising’s work exhibits notable strengths and enduring tensions. Positively, his stress on **inaugurated eschatology**, his refusal of a two-peoples soteriology, and his **canonical** discipline resonate with Reformed commitments to **Christ’s** kingship, the unity of **covenant history**, and the integrity of **authorial intent**. His critique of a free-floating **sensus plenior** and his insistence that **NT fulfillment** does not arbitrarily cancel **OT** horizons show exegetical rigor that many Reformed exegetes share. Yet tensions remain. First, his **complementary hermeneutics** can appear to undercut the typological finality claimed by **Hebrews** and **Ephesians**, where many in the Reformed tradition see the land, temple, and national structures as subsumed in the eschatological church and transposed into the **new creation** without an intervening historical kingdom. Second, his reading of **Romans 11** as entailing a national-terrestrial restoration for **Israel** goes beyond the **amillennial** construal of a mass conversion into the one church, raising concerns about a reification of ethnic distinctions within the one new humanity. Third, his premillennial and often **pretribulational** sequencing may be judged to fragment the unity of the **parousia** and resurrection in ways at odds with classic Reformed eschatology. A Reformed alternative would press a stronger doctrine of **covenant of grace**, a single climactic **parousia** that ushers directly into the **new heavens and new earth**, and a typological reading in which **Christ** is the exhaustive telos of land and polity. Even so, Blaising’s progressive dispensationalism remains a serious, text-driven interlocutor, sharpening Reformed exegesis on the **NT use of the OT** and inviting renewed clarity on how **kingdom**, **covenant**, and **church** coinhere.
