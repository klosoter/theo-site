### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Disruption, and Method
James Bannerman, Free Church divine from 1807 to 1868, rose within the crucible of the **Scottish Disruption** of 1843, when ministers seceded to defend **Christ's headship** and the **spiritual independence of the church** against state patronage. Ordained in 1833 and later appointed in 1849 as Professor of **Apologetics and Pastoral Theology** at New College, Edinburgh, his intellectual setting combined **post-Reformation Reformed scholasticism** with **Scottish common-sense realism**, yielding a method that was exegetical, historical, and juristic. He read **Calvin**, **Rutherford**, and **Gillespie** through the lens of the **Westminster Confession**, while responding to **Anglican Erastianism** and **Voluntary** critiques. Bannerman framed theology as a science ordered by **Scripture's sufficiency** and governed by the distinction between **divine institution** and **human prudence**, deploying Latin categories like **potestas ordinis** and **potestas jurisdictionis** to mark the church's *ad intra* and *ad extra* powers under **Christ the King**.

His method was neither speculative metaphysics nor romantic historicism but a careful collocation of **biblical proofs**, **confessional formulations**, and **case law** from church history. He insisted that all ecclesiastical power is **ministerial and declarative**, not **magisterial and legislative**, echoing classic **jure divino Presbyterianism**. He held that **theology** proceeds by the **analogia fidei**, weighing loci against the rule of the **oracles of God**, while employing the sober canons of **Scottish evidential reasoning** in apologetic matters. Thus, the **two kingdoms doctrine** afforded a principled way to understand the distinct yet coordinated jurisdictions of **church** and **state**, guarding the **keys of the kingdom** from civil usurpation while upholding the magistrate's **nursing-father** role.

#### 2. The Church of Christ: Nature, Notes, and Structure
Bannerman's magnum opus, **The Church of Christ** (1869), systematizes a full **ecclesiology** under the axiom of **Christ's sole headship**. He distinguishes the **invisible church**, the *communio sanctorum* united by the Spirit's *vinculum*, from the **visible church**, the external society gathered by **Word and sacrament** under appointed officers. The classic **notes** of the true church are upheld: **pure preaching**, **right administration of sacraments**, and **faithful discipline**, firmly within **Reformed orthodoxy**. From **Matthew 16** and **18**, **John 20**, and **Acts 15**, he argues for the **claves regni** as Christ's grant of derived authority to the visible society.

Within this framework, Bannerman articulates **potestas ordinis** as the authority to preach and administer **baptism** and the **Lord's Supper**, and **potestas jurisdictionis** as the authority to exercise **discipline** and **government**. Both are ministerial offices of **obedience to Scripture**, not sources of **new law**. He advances **parity of presbyters**, the **office of ruling elders**, and the **diaconate**, contending against **episcopacy** for a collegial presbyterate and against **congregational independency** for graded courts. Ecclesiastical **courts** rise from **Kirk Session** to **Presbytery**, **Synod**, and **General Assembly**, not as hierarchical domination but as an ordered expression of **catholic connectionalism**. The polity is jure divino because it flows from the institution of **Christ and his apostles**, not merely a prudent arrangement.

#### 3. Church Power and the Keys: Ministerial and Declarative
Central to Bannerman is the doctrine that all ecclesiastical authority is **ministerial and declarative** of **Christ's law**. The church may bind and loose only by declaring what Scripture binds and looses, never by **intrinsic legislation**. Here he appropriates older Reformed disputations, especially **George Gillespie's Aaron's Rod Blossoming** and **Samuel Rutherford's** treatises, to argue that **synods and councils** may publish determinations, yet their **authority is subordinate** to the **Word of God**. This yields a robust theology of **confessions and creeds**: they possess legitimate, ecclesiastical authority as **public testimony** and **terms of ecclesiastical fellowship**, yet they bind the conscience only insofar as they echo **Scripture's truth**.

In practical church life, this means that **discipline** is an **ordinance of Christ**, essential to **holiness**, **unity**, and **truth**. Bannerman defends **fencing the table**, **admission to communion**, and **censure** as pastoral and juridical acts of the **keys**, always to be exercised with **edification** as end. The **sacraments** function as seals of the **covenant of grace**, which grounds **infant baptism** and a careful theology of visible membership. Reformed **sacramentology** thus interlocks with **polity**, such that the **marks** of the church cannot be divorced from its **government**. The church's power, because it is only **declarative**, guards liberty of conscience from **tyranny**, even as it safeguards the body from **doctrinal and moral corruption**.

#### 4. Against Erastianism, Prelacy, and Independency
Bannerman's polemics move along three fronts: against **Erastianism**, against **prelacy** or **Anglican episcopacy**, and against **Congregational or Independent** polity. His anti-Erastian case indicts the notion, whether in **Thomas Erastus** or in **latitudinarian Anglicans** like **Richard Hooker**, that the civil magistrate holds **final jurisdiction** in ecclesiastical causes. He charges that such views confound the **two kingdoms doctrine**, obliterating **spiritual jurisdiction** by making church censures either redundant or civilly administered. The hallmark of **Christ's headship** is ecclesiastical liberty in **doctrine**, **worship**, and **discipline**; the magistrate may protect and outwardly support the church, but he cannot adjudicate **heresy** or command **sacraments**.

Against **prelacy**, Bannerman returns to **New Testament polity**: the identity of **bishop** and **presbyter**, collegial oversight, and the pattern of **Acts 15**. He argues that episcopal hierarchy lacks **jure divino warrant** and endangers the **ministerial and declarative** character of church authority by giving personal prelates a quasi-legislative power. Against **Independency**, he contends that isolated congregations cannot adequately preserve **catholicity** or administer **discipline** justly. He engages **John Owen** respectfully yet disputes the sufficiency of congregational councils, asserting that **connectional presbyterianism** better expresses **Ephesians 4** and the **communion of churches**.

#### 5. Establishments in Principle and the Two Kingdoms
Notwithstanding his anti-Erastian stance, Bannerman defends the **establishment principle** as compatible with the **spiritual independence of the church**. Drawing on **Isaiah 49:23**, **historic Protestant confessions**, and **Scottish constitutional precedent**, he claims that magistrates as **nursing fathers** may recognize, protect, and endow the true religion without usurping **ecclesiastical jurisdiction**. The key distinction is jurisdictional: the **civil kingdom** concerns outward peace and righteousness, while the **spiritual kingdom** concerns **Word, sacrament, and keys**. When establishment collapses distinction, he denounces it as **Erastian**; when it honors distinction, he commends it as a public good.

Historically, he situates this within the **Disruption**: the state, by enforcing **patronage** and resisting **non-intrusion**, violated the church's **spiritual liberty**, thereby making disestablishment necessary de facto. Yet de jure, establishment remains lawful in principle. This subtlety marks his negotiation with both **Voluntaries**, who reject any civil support of religion, and **Anglicans**, who identify church and nation under **Erastian supremacy**. The **two kingdoms doctrine** thus underwrites a cooperative but bounded relation, with **Christ's headship** the non-negotiable anchor of ecclesial freedom.

#### 6. Creeds, Councils, and Terms of Communion
Bannerman's ecclesiology includes a careful doctrine of **creedal authority** and **councils**. He affirms **Nicaea** and the **Apostolic Tradition** as normative where they are biblical, but he resists any **magisterial** elevation of tradition. Confessions such as the **Westminster Standards** function as **public instruments of testimony** and as **terms of ministerial subscription**, shaping the church's corporate witness. He defends **strict subscription** for office-bearers as consonant with **ministerial and declarative** authority, while urging pastoral prudence in **communion** to avoid unnecessary **sectarianism**. The goal is catholicity under the rule of **Scripture**, not a reductionist minimalism.

On **discipline**, his criteria measure both **doctrinal deviation** and **moral scandal** by the clear commands of **Scripture**. The church's censures are ordered to **restoration** and **edification**, never coercion of conscience beyond the **Word**. Because the church does not legislate **new articles of faith**, even confessional authority is tethered to **biblical fidelity**. In all these measures, Bannerman's vision is that of a **Reformed catholicity**, robustly confessional yet consciously bounded by **Christ's law** and the **keys** he alone wields.

#### 7. Inspiration and Apologetics
In **Inspiration** (1865), Bannerman turns from ecclesiology to the **doctrine of Scripture**, defending **plenary verbal inspiration** and **inerrancy** against the rising **historical criticism** of his day, including the controversies sparked by **J. W. Colenso** and mediated from **German criticism**. He argues that the **Scriptures** claim and manifest **divine authority**, adducing the biblical doctrine of **theopneustos** and the pattern of **prophetic and apostolic** utterance. He contends that inspiration extends to the **words** and not merely the **thoughts**, safeguarding the trustworthiness of **history**, **doctrine**, and **ethics**. The church receives the canon because **God speaks**, not because of autonomous human consensus, though he marshals **external evidences** to corroborate Scripture's claims.

His apologetic has a dual register: he argues for the self-witness of **Scripture** and the **internal testimony of the Holy Spirit**, while also employing **evidential arguments** from **miracles**, **prophecy**, and **coherence**. Against theories of **accommodation** or **partial inspiration**, he asserts a comprehensive inspiration that accommodates human style yet ensures **truth without mixture of error** in all it affirms. This aligns him with the **Westminster Confession** on **infallibility** and embeds his ecclesiology within a sturdy **bibliology**. By defending **Scripture's authority**, he underwrites the entire edifice of **ministerial and declarative** church power, since the church can only declare what God has breathed out.

#### 8. Historical Interlocutors and Scholastic Continuities
Bannerman consciously stands in a line from **Calvin**, through the **Second Reformation** Scots, to the **Westminster Assembly**. He cites **Rutherford**, **Gillespie**, and **Samuel Miller** to defend **Presbyterian polity**, and he contends with **Hooker** and **Owen** as dignified but mistaken interlocutors on polity. He reads patristic materials with Protestant sobriety, acknowledging early **episcopal tendencies** while denying their **apostolic normativity**. His scholastic continuities are apparent in the careful use of loci, in the distinction of **potestas ordinis** and **potestas jurisdictionis**, and in the preferred procedural maxim that the church rules by **jus divinum** rather than **jus humanum**.

In politics, he is closer to classic **magisterial Protestantism** than to later **Voluntaryism**, though he shares with the latter a keen sense of **spiritual independence**. His rhetoric of the **two kingdoms doctrine** anticipates later debates within **Reformed theology** about **sphere sovereignty** and **principled pluralism**, even as he defends the older **establishment principle**. On bibliology, he anticipates later **Princeton** and **Westminster** defenses of **inerrancy**, though his **apologetic method** retains the stamp of **Scottish common-sense realism** more than a fully **presuppositional** stance.

#### 9. Legacy and Reception
The immediate impact of **The Church of Christ** was to furnish the **Free Church of Scotland** with a comprehensive **ecclesiological manual**, used for decades in ministerial formation. In the English-speaking Reformed world, his work became a central resource on **church power**, **discipline**, and **confessional subscription**, reprinted by publishers committed to **classical Presbyterianism**. Debates on **establishment** evolved, particularly with the **American Presbyterian** revision of **Westminster Confession 23** in 1788 and with twentieth-century **religious liberty** jurisprudence, yet Bannerman's precise delineation of **church–state jurisdictions** has endured as a template for defending **spiritual independence** even in pluralist settings.

His **Inspiration** fed into the current that would later shape **Princeton theology** and be codified in **Chicago Statement** style articulations of **inerrancy**, though its nineteenth-century polemical contours differ from later **neo-evangelical** debates. Modern Presbyterian discussions of **fencing the table**, **officer subscription**, and **judicial process** still quote his distinction between **ministerial and declarative** authority and **magisterial** pretension. Thus, Bannerman's reputation remains tied to the grand themes of **Christ's headship**, **the keys of the kingdom**, and the **two kingdoms doctrine**, making him a perennial reference in Reformed ecclesiological reflection.

In Reformed and WTS evaluation, Bannerman's strengths are significant: he anchors **ecclesiology** in **Christ's headship**, guards **liberty of conscience** by insisting that church power is **ministerial and declarative**, and grounds **polity** in a rich **biblical and confessional** synthesis. His **plenary verbal inspiration** aligns with **Westminster** and later **WTS** commitments to **inerrancy** and **Scripture's self-attestation**. Yet tensions surface. His **establishment principle** sits uneasily with modern **religious liberty** and the **American Presbyterian** trajectory that revises **magistracy** language; a WTS-shaped alternative commends **sphere sovereignty** or a sharpened **two kingdoms** view that secures **ecclesial independence** without state establishment. Methodologically, his **evidentialist** apologetic leans on **common-sense realism** more than a **presuppositional** critique of autonomy, though his appeal to the **Spirit's internal testimony** mitigates this. Exegetically, certain **jure divino** constructions rely on concatenated inferences that invite a more **redemptive-historical** reading of **Acts** and the **Pastorals**. Within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, these are differences of prudence and method, not substance: the abiding value remains his unwavering defense of **Christ's headship** and the **spiritual independence of the church** in doctrine, worship, and discipline.
