### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The life of **Stephen Charnock** 1628–1680 unfolds across the convulsions of **post-Reformation England**, from the **Civil War** through the **Interregnum** to the **Restoration**, and his theology bears the marks of **Puritan nonconformity** and **Protestant scholasticism**. Educated in **Cambridge circles** shaped by **William Perkins** and **William Ames**, Charnock mastered the scholastic arts of **distinction**, **definition**, and **ordered disputation** while absorbing a Puritan commitment to **experimental piety** and **practical divinity**. His service as **chaplain to Henry Cromwell** in **Ireland** during the 1650s placed him at the intersection of **statecraft**, **pastoral care**, and **apologetics**, as he confronted **Roman Catholic polemic**, **Epicurean skepticism**, and emergent **Hobbesian materialism**. After the **Act of Uniformity 1662** forced his ejection, he reemerged in **London** as a gathered-church pastor and, from 1675 to his death, co-labored with **Thomas Watson** at **Crosby Hall** Bishopsgate, preaching the sermons that became his signature contribution on **the divine attributes**.

The guiding method of Charnock is a disciplined union of **Scripture sufficiency** and **scholastic reasoning** in service of **worship**. He assumes the **analogia fidei** of Scripture as norming norm and employs the classical *via negativa*, *via causalitatis*, and *via eminentiae* to articulate **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** against anthropomorphic misreadings. His sermons exhibit a consistent pattern: first, the **textual proposition**; second, doctrinal **explication** with **distinctions** and **syllogistic reasons**; third, **uses** for **adoration**, **humiliation**, and **consolation**. Charnock speaks the language of **actus purus** and *ad intra* versus *ad extra* operations, yet he translates these into the Puritan idiom of **heart religion**, insisting that truths about **God's spirituality** and **eternity** are the grammar of **worship in spirit and truth**.

#### 2. Works and their architecture
The core of Charnock's legacy is his posthumous **Discourses upon the Existence and Attributes of God 1682**, the fruit of London preaching during the 1670s, alongside allied **Discourses on Providence** and **Discourses on Regeneration** published in the early 1680s. These are not topical essays but extended **expository-sermon series**, each anchored in a central **biblical text** and unfolded with **scholastic rigor**. The **Existence and Attributes** begins with a discourse against **atheism** drawn from **Psalm 14** and **Romans 1**, proceeding to **God's spirituality** from **John 4:24**, then to **eternity** from **Psalm 90:2**, and on through **immutability**, **omnipresence**, **omniscience**, **wisdom**, **power**, **holiness**, **goodness**, **mercy**, **patience**, and **sovereignty**, each treated as an aspect of the **simple divine essence**. The **Discourses on Providence** explore **first cause and secondary causes** under the sovereignty of **divine decree**, and the **Discourses on Regeneration** present a classic Puritan defense of **monergistic new birth**, arguing the priority of **effectual calling** in the **ordo salutis**.

Charnock's works are scholastic in **method** yet **pastoral** in **aim**. He engages **Aquinas** and the **scholastic tradition** on **simplicity** and **aseity**, cites **Augustine** on **immutability** and **grace**, and follows **Ames** and **Perkins** in collapsing speculative distance between **doctrine** and **piety**. The editions of **1682–1684** thematize this union: in the same volumes one finds discourses that ascend to **God's infinitude** and descend to the penitent's **conscience**. For Charnock, the structure of **worship** rests on the structure of **theology proper**; the more exalted the **divine perfections**, the more searching the **uses** that summon **reverence** and **repentance**.

#### 3. The divine attributes: simplicity, aseity, immutability
At the heart of Charnock's theology proper is a robust affirmation of **divine simplicity**, classically construed. God is **simple**, without composition of act and potency, essence and existence, or form and matter, hence **identical** with his **attributes**. Charnock accepts the scholastic maxim that **God's attributes are not accidents in God but the essence viewed diversely**, that is, **distinct only *secundum rationem*** by the reason's different conceptions. This protects **aseity**, God's from-himselfness, and **self-sufficiency**, which Charnock calls the **independence** of God, denying any **mutual dependence** between Creator and creature that would unsettle **immutability**. He argues that Scripture's ascriptions of **love**, **wrath**, and **repentance** must be interpreted through a doctrine of **divine impassibility**, acknowledging real **ad extra** effects without positing **ad intra** emotional change.

Charnock's account of **immutability** and **eternity** maintains the classic doctrine of **God's timelessness**, though he speaks in the idiom of **duration without succession**. He does not deny the reality of **temporal relations** established by **free decree**, but he refuses any conception of **becoming in God**, a stance that arms his polemic against **Socinian** claims that the biblical God grows in knowledge or changes his will. His discourse on **omniscience** similarly unites **foreknowledge** and **decree**, rejecting both **Pelagian contingency** that floats free of sovereignty and **fatalism** that swallows second causes. Throughout, Charnock observes the hermeneutical axiom that **metaphysical perfections** regulate the reading of **anthropomorphic** texts, so that **holiness** and **goodness** are expounded as identical with the **simple essence** while remaining conceptually distinct for the sake of **worship and obedience**.

#### 4. Existence of God and the uses of natural theology
Charnock opens the **Existence and Attributes** with a vigorous refutation of **atheism**. He disposes of **speculative atheism** as practically impossible, diagnosing **atheism of the heart** as the true target of **Psalm 14**. He argues from **general revelation** and **common notions** that God is known by **causality** from the **order of nature**, **finality** in **ends**, and **moral law** in **conscience**, thus deploying **cosmological**, **teleological**, and **moral** lines of thought. The vocabulary of **efficient cause**, **final cause**, and **first cause** attests his alignment with **Aquinas** and **Reformed orthodox** authors like **Polanus** and **Turretin**, yet he refuses an autonomous **natural theology**, subordinating all to **Scripture** as the sufficient and clear **norma normans**.

Charnock's apologetic is therefore twofold: he grants the **lumen naturale** and the **sensus divinitatis**, insisting with **Calvin** that unbelief is **culpable suppression**, while he binds the certainty and saving knowledge of God to **special revelation** in **Christ** and **Scripture**. He opposes **Hobbesian materialism** as self-defeating, calling it a denial of **mind** that cannot account for **reason** or **morality**, and he rejects **Socinian rationalism** for submitting **mystery** to the tribunal of **reason**. His metaphysical claims about **simplicity** and **aseity** thus furnish a platform for an evangelical demand: since God is **most perfect** and **most holy**, atheism is not refuted merely by **argument** but slain by **worship** and **repentance**.

#### 5. Worship in spirit and truth
One of the most striking features of Charnock's **theology proper** is its doxological orientation in **Gospel worship**. Taking **John 4:24** as a banner, he insists that because God is **Spirit**, true **worship** must be **spiritual**, **sincere**, and **regulated** by the **Word**. His **Gospel Worship** discourses integrate **regulated worship** principles with **experimental godliness**, warning against **formalism** and **ceremonialism** while rejecting **enthusiasm** that severs **Spirit** from **truth**. The **simplicity** of God grounds a **simplicity** in **worship**: God, being **indivisible and pure**, cannot be honored by **divided hearts** or **sensuous inventions**.

Charnock also connects **divine holiness** with the **ethics of worship**. Holiness is the **beauty of the divine attributes**, the aspect of the **simple essence** that orders all others toward **moral purity**. Thus he amplifies the **uses** of the doctrine: the holiness of God condemns **hypocrisy**, calls for **holiness** in the worshiper, and confers **assurance** that God's **promises** are inviolable because his **will** is **immutable**. The discourse on **God's goodness** turns naturally to **gratitude**, treating **thanksgiving** not as an optional condiment but as the fitting echo of **divine beneficence**. For Charnock, the grammar of **worship** is learned in the school of **attributes**.

#### 6. Providence, decree, and secondary causes
Charnock's **Discourses on Providence** operate within the classic **Reformed** account of **decree** and **concurrence**. God is the **first cause**, freely decreeing whatsoever comes to pass, while creatures are **true secondary causes**, acting with integrity according to their **natures**. Charnock refuses both **occasionalism**, which dissolves creaturely agency, and **Pelagian libertarianism**, which evacuates **providence**. He explains **events** as under **God's government**, **contingent** relative to secondary causes but **certain** relative to the **divine will**, and he addresses the perennial problem of **evil** by defending **permission** and **ordination** without assigning God as the **efficient cause of sin**.

The practical payoff is marked. Under **providence**, the believer is summoned to **patience** in affliction, **humility** in prosperity, and **prayer** as a means appointed by **decree**. Charnock's scholastic terms, such as **order of causes** and **modes of concursus**, are yoked to Puritan counsel for **conscience**. He reads **Romans 8:28** not as a naive optimism but as the assertion that **holiness** and **hope** grow from the soil of **sovereignty**, anchoring **assurance** in the **immutable** goodness of **God**.

#### 7. Regeneration, grace, and the will
In the **Discourses on Regeneration**, Charnock advances a classic **Augustinian-Calvinist** account of **effectual calling** and **new birth**. He argues that **regeneration** is a **supernatural habitus** infused by the **Holy Spirit**, renewing the **mind**, **will**, and **affections**. Against **Arminian synergism**, he contends that **faith** is the **gift of God**, consequent upon **regeneration**, not its condition, aligning with the **ordo salutis** prominent in **Reformed orthodoxy**. He employs scholastic tools of **faculties** and **habits** to articulate how **grace** does not violate **nature** but heals and elevates it, a thesis consonant with the broader **nature and grace** pattern in **Aquinas** yet chastened by **Reformed** commitments to **Scripture** and **covenant**.

Charnock's anthropology emphasizes the **noetic effects of sin**, a key to his apologetic against **atheism** and **Socinianism**. The **darkened understanding** cannot, by its own light, ascend to the **saving knowledge of God**; therefore the **ministry of the Word** and the **Spirit's illumination** are necessary. He aligns with **John Owen** on the **Spirit's work**, though his representational style is less polemical and more homiletical. The **uses** press toward **self-examination**, **seeking grace**, and **mortification**, thus fusing **doctrine of God** with **doctrine of man** in a pastoral key.

#### 8. Interlocutors and the intellectual milieu
Charnock's discourses engage, often implicitly, with the philosophical currents of his century. He resists **Hobbes's Leviathan** by affirming **immaterial substance** and **spiritual causality**, holding that **matter in motion** cannot account for **normativity**, **intentionality**, or **worship**. He shares a common foe with the **Cambridge Platonists** like **Ralph Cudworth**, particularly in exposing **atheistic mechanisms**, yet he differs from their **metaphysical optimism** and **moralism**, insisting on **original sin** and the necessity of **regenerating grace**. Against **Socinianism**, he defends **Trinitarian** and **Christological** dogma by presupposing a **theology proper** that secures **mystery** and excludes **univocal predication** about God.

While he borrows **Aquinas's** causal grammar and defends **divine simplicity**, he remains a **Reformed Protestant**, refusing the **analogia entis** as a natural bridge to God and instead grounding theological language in **revelation** governed **analogy** and **covenant**. His approach is representative of **high Reformed orthodoxy**, akin to **Francis Turretin** and **Petrus van Mastricht**, where **exegesis**, **dogmatics**, and **practice** are woven into a single fabric. This is the Puritan genius: scholastic in spine, pastoral in heart, and polemical as needed.

#### 9. Style, homiletics, and spirituality
Stylistically, Charnock is a physician of the **soul** whose instrument is **scholastic clarity**. His discourses are long, but their architecture is transparent: a **doctrine** carefully stated, **reasons** in ordered sequence, **objections** stated and answered, and **uses** that turn doctrine into **devotion**. He tends to favor **comprehensive catalogues** of the **divine perfections**, reminding hearers that **God's attributes** are not items on a list but **the one essence** refracted through **creaturely concepts**. The rhetorical center is worshipful wonder: if **God is spirit**, then the believer must become a **spiritual worshiper**; if **God is immutable**, then **hope** is unshakable; if **God is holy**, then **repentance** is non-negotiable.

This homiletical pattern expresses a **Puritan** conviction that **theology** is for **godliness**. Charnock's **worship ethic**, **providence counsel**, and **regeneration doctrine** all aim at **communion with God**. The **attributes** function like lenses grinding the vision of faith: the clearer **divine simplicity** and **aseity**, the purer **adoration**; the deeper **goodness** and **mercy**, the bolder **prayer** and **obedience**. In this way, his **theology proper** becomes a school of **sanctification**, not a museum of metaphysics.

#### 10. Legacy and Reformed/WTS evaluation
Charnock's influence has been steady among **Reformed pastors** and **theologians**, his **Existence and Attributes of God 1682** remaining one of the finest English-language treatments of **classical theism**. He models how **Protestant scholasticism** can serve **pastoral theology**, and he demonstrates that **Puritan piety** is not allergic to **metaphysical precision**. Later **evangelical** and **Reformed** receptions have prized his defense of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, especially in periods when these perfections have been questioned by **process theology**, **open theism**, or **theistic personalism**. His apologetic energies directed against **Hobbes** and **Socinians** also anticipate later debates about **naturalism** and **revelation**.

From a **Reformed/WTS evaluation**, appreciations and cautions are both warranted. Positively, Charnock's **doctrine of God** stands squarely within **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**, reinforcing **Westminster** commitments to **simplicity**, **immutability**, **providence**, and **effectual calling**, and modeling a pedagogy that unites **textual exegesis**, **scholastic method**, and **pastoral application**. Critically, some modern **Van Tilian** concerns target his sympathy for **classical proofs** and **common notions**, lest these be taken as a neutral **epistemic platform**. Yet Charnock himself subordinates **natural theology** to **Scripture** and treats the **sensus divinitatis** as ethically suppressed, a stance readily harmonized with **covenantal epistemology** that denies **autonomous reason**. A constructive alternative within the **classical Reformed** spectrum is not the abandonment of **causal arguments**, but their re-situation within **revelational authority**, **covenant accountability**, and a **Creator-creature distinction** safeguarded by **analogy**. Read this way, Charnock is not a foil but an ally for a **Westminster** program that holds together **revelation and reason**, **covenant and creation**, **grace and nature**, in the service of **worship**.
