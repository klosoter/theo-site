### TITLE
Friedrich Schleiermacher is the paradigmatic modern liberal theologian who relocates theology from Gods self-revelation in Scripture to the self-consciousness of religious experience, thereby both brilliantly systematizing Romantic piety and decisively undermining confessional orthodoxy.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Friedrich Schleiermacher** 1768–1834 stands at the crossroads of **Enlightenment rationalism** and **German Romanticism** in Berlin and Halle.
- As pastor and professor amid **Prussian** modernization and post-Kantian philosophy he seeks to rescue **Christianity** after **Kant**, **Lessing**, and the **Aufklärung**.

- His method centers on the **feeling (*Gefühl*) of absolute dependence**, an immediate pre-reflective self-consciousness that is taken as the essence of religion.
- **Theology** for him is a descriptive science of the Christian **religious self-consciousness** of the community, not a deductive exposition of revealed dogma.
- He redefines **revelation** as the original God-consciousness of **Christ** communicated through the **church**, rather than as propositional Scripture.

- In **On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers** 1799 he defends religion as **intuition and feeling** of the infinite against Enlightenment criticism.
- In **The Christian Faith** 1821/22, 2nd ed. 1830, he offers a full **Dogmatics** constructed from the Christian self-consciousness, with doctrines as second-order reflections.
- In his **Hermeneutics** lectures he advances a universal theory of interpretation centered on psychological and grammatical understanding of texts.
- In **Brief Outline of the Study of Theology** 1811 he defines theology as an empirical, practical science in service of the **church**.

- He is decisive for **revelation and Scripture**, redefining both in experiential and historical terms rather than as inerrant verbal self-disclosure of God.
- He recasts **Christology and soteriology**, making the redeeming work consist in the communication of **God-consciousness** rather than vicarious atonement.
- He reconceives **Trinity** and **church** as regulative expressions of communal piety, marginal to the core of Christian faith.

- From a **Reformed** Westminster standpoint he is a crucial negative reference point, since he founds doctrine on **experience** rather than on the self-attesting **Word of God**.
- Examiners will want me to expose how his redefinition of **sin, atonement, and Scripture** undercuts the **Westminster Confession** while also noting his serious engagement with modernity.

- For comparison I should set **Schleiermacher vs Barth** on revelation and Christology, tracing both continuity and Barth’s radical criticism.
- I should also contrast **Schleiermacher vs Bavinck** on dogmatics as the scientific articulation of revealed truth rather than of religious consciousness.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**Friedrich Schleiermacher** was born in 1768 in Breslau, raised in a Pietist environment associated with the **Moravians**, then educated in Enlightenment influenced institutions at Halle and Berlin. He lived through the clash of **Enlightenment rationalism**, emerging **German Idealism**, and **Romanticism**, and he ministered as Reformed preacher in Berlin while teaching at the new **University of Berlin** from 1810 until his death in 1834. Theologically he stands between **Kant** and **Hegel**, deeply marked by Kant’s critique of metaphysics in the first **Critique**, which seemed to evacuate traditional natural and revealed theology of rational credibility. His early work **On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers** 1799 is explicitly aimed at the cosmopolitan elite formed by **Lessing**, **Wolff**, and the **Aufklärung**, who regarded positive Christianity as either irrational dogma or moralism. The driving problem of his life work is therefore: How can Christian religion be justified and articulated after the Enlightenment has discredited speculative metaphysics and historical dogma, and after the Romantics have elevated individuality and aesthetic intuition. Schleiermacher’s answer is to relocate the essence of **religion** away from metaphysical propositions and moral commands toward an immediate, pre-conceptual *Gefühl* of the infinite, thereby attempting to secure religion against rational critique while still enabling a systematic **Dogmatics**. This basic project of grounding theology in the structures of human subjectivity becomes the seed of modern **liberal theology**, in deliberate contrast to the confessional **Reformed** and **Lutheran** orthodoxy of earlier centuries.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
For **Schleiermacher**, the decisive starting point is neither metaphysical reason nor external authority but **religious experience**, described in **On Religion** and more rigorously in **The Christian Faith**. He defines religion not as knowledge or morality but as the immediate consciousness of absolute dependence, a **feeling (*Gefühl*)** that precedes and grounds thinking and willing. This feeling is consciousness of oneself as wholly conditioned by an infinite Other, which he identifies as **God**, yet the content of this feeling is not conceptually determinate; dogmas arise only as reflective expressions of this prior self-consciousness. Revelation for Schleiermacher is therefore not primarily propositional disclosure, as in classic **Reformed** orthodoxy, but the original fullness of God-consciousness given in the person of **Jesus of Nazareth**, then communicated historically through the **church** as a living community of faith.

This method yields a distinctive understanding of **Scripture and history**. In **The Christian Faith** and in his **Brief Outline of the Study of Theology**, Schleiermacher insists that Christian theology is the systematic articulation of the piety of the Christian community, which is historically mediated by Scripture but not exhaustively equated with it. Scripture is the foundational document of the community, yet its authority is derivative from its empirical effectiveness in generating and sustaining the distinct **Christian God-consciousness**. Historical criticism and philology, which he develops in his **Hermeneutics**, serve to clarify what the texts historically meant and how they function in the community, but there is no appeal to an inerrant, self-attesting divine Word in the sense of **Calvin** or the **Westminster Confession**. Theology is thus an empirical, descriptive science of the religious life of the church, akin to a rigorous form of religious psychology and history, rather than a normative exposition of revealed propositions.

Reason for **Schleiermacher** functions as the organ that orders and conceptualizes the immediate data of religious experience, not as an autonomous source of **natural theology**. He follows **Kant** in denying speculative knowledge of God by pure reason, yet instead of turning theology into ethics as Kant did, he places it under the category of feeling and intuition. The *a priori* is now located in the structures of religious self-consciousness rather than in pure reason. The **church** becomes the locus where the archetypal God-consciousness of Christ is reproduced and intensified; theology is therefore churchly and communal, yet it is descriptive of what the community in fact believes and experiences, not prescriptive on the basis of a given revealed canon. In direct contrast to **Reformed scholasticism**, which takes Scripture as principium cognoscendi and builds theology as a dogmatic science ordered by divine revelation, Schleiermacher’s **method** casts theology as a second-order reflection on human consciousness and historical experience, even when it uses biblical language.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
On **revelation and Scripture**, classic Reformed confessionalism states that God has accommodated himself to speak in human words, with Scripture as the inspired, infallible, and sufficient rule of faith and life, so that dogmatics explicates a given corpus of revealed truth. **Schleiermacher** reverses this order by locating revelation in the person and consciousness of **Christ** and in the ongoing life of the **church**, with Scripture understood as the earliest and normative expression of that life but not as a verbally inspired deposit. In **The Christian Faith** he explicitly defines doctrine as an account of the Christian religious affections set forth in speech, implying that any doctrinal proposition is a conceptual crystallization of felt God-consciousness. Critics like **Karl Barth** later charged that this makes the Word of God depend on the religious subject, rather than the subject being judged by the external Word. In this model, errors and tensions in Scripture are unproblematic, since what matters is the pious content it mediates; hence historical criticism is welcomed, and the canon is subordinated to the experiential canon of Christ as the archetype of God-consciousness. From a **Reformed** standpoint this severs the principial role of Scripture and undermines its self-attesting authority.

In **Christology and soteriology**, the classic baseline is the Chalcedonian confession of one person in two natures, with **Christ** accomplishing redemption through his obedient life and vicarious, penal substitutionary death, applied by the Spirit through faith. **Schleiermacher** affirms Chalcedonian formulas formally, yet he reinterprets them through the lens of religious self-consciousness. In **The Christian Faith** he identifies Christ’s uniqueness with his perfect, constant **God-consciousness**, which is archetypal and communicable, rather than primarily with a metaphysical union of natures. Sin for him is the disturbance of God-consciousness; redemption is the restoration of this consciousness in the community as the life of Christ reproduces itself in believers. The atonement, therefore, does not centrally involve satisfaction of divine justice, as in **Anselm** or **Calvin**, but rather the transformative influence of Christ’s piety upon the church. Interlocutors like **Hegel** and later **Ritschl** developed or criticized these moves, while Reformed theologians like **B. B. Warfield** saw in them the evacuation of substitutionary atonement and the reduction of salvation to moral and psychological change. The cross is significant for Schleiermacher because it reveals the depth of Christ’s God-consciousness under suffering, not because it is a penal sacrifice.

Regarding the **Trinity and doctrine of God**, classical dogma confesses the eternal, ontological Trinity of Father, Son, and Spirit as *homoousios*, intrinsic to the being of God, and makes this doctrine central to Christian worship and theology. **Schleiermacher** notoriously relegates the doctrine of the **Trinity** to the final pages of **The Christian Faith**, and he treats it as a summary expression of the way God is experienced through redemption rather than as a revealed description of inner divine life. God is primarily known as the Whence of our feeling of absolute dependence, with attributes understood as ways of characterizing this dependence rather than as metaphysically precise perfections. Influenced by **Spinoza** and post-Kantian pantheistic currents, his God-concept tends toward a panentheistic immanence, with the world as the sphere of revelation and the locus of God’s self-manifestation in consciousness. For **Reformed** orthodoxy, by contrast, the Trinity is architectonic, with the economic missions revealing the immanent processions. Schleiermacher’s placement and reinterpretation of the Trinity signal a shift from ontological to phenomenological priorities.

In the realm of **church and culture**, classic Reformed thought distinguishes creator and creature, nature and grace, and the church as the covenant community under the Word, even while affirming a broad cultural mandate. **Schleiermacher** offers in his **Brief Outline of the Study of Theology** and in various sermons a vision of the **church** as the historical community where God-consciousness is preserved and intensified, closely interwoven with modern culture and the emerging **nation-state**. Theology is an ecclesial science but also an academic discipline in the modern university, serving the practical needs of the church within the broader cultural project of moral and aesthetic formation. In **On Religion**, his apologetic addresses to the cultured despisers aim to show that religion is the deepest dimension of human spirit, not in competition with art, science, or ethics but as their unifying root. This move tends to harmonize **Christianity** with the best of modern culture and to reduce doctrinal antithesis in favor of universal structures of piety. Later liberal theologians such as **Ritschl** and **Harnack** inherit this cultural optimism, while confessional Reformed voices like **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** critique its underestimation of antithesis and of the noetic effects of sin on culture and thought.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
From the standpoint of classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, represented by **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and later **Bavinck**, Schleiermacher’s project represents a fundamental reorientation of theology’s principia. Where Reformed theology insists that the principium essendi of theology is the triune **God** and the principium cognoscendi is **Holy Scripture** as inspired Word, Schleiermacher makes the religious self-consciousness of the **church** the proximate source and norm, with Christ as the archetype of God-consciousness but not as objectively present in a closed canon. Westminster examiners must object at two central points. First, his doctrine of **Scripture and revelation** collapses the authority of the external Word into the internal structures of piety, which contradicts the self-authenticating character of Scripture attested by **Van Til** and the Reformed confessions. Second, his reconfiguration of **sin and atonement** from guilt before a holy God to disturbance of God-consciousness, and from penal substitution to transformative influence, denies the core of **Reformed** soteriology.

At the same time, later Reformed thinkers can learn from Schleiermacher’s seriousness about historical consciousness and the communal character of faith. **Bavinck** in his Reformed Dogmatics critically engages **Schleiermacher**, acknowledging that dogmatics must attend to the life of the church and to the organic development of doctrine in history, even while rooting that development in objective revelation rather than in experience. **Vos** and **Ridderbos** similarly recognize that redemptive history shapes the church’s self-understanding, though they inversely subordinate experience to the unfolding of the covenant Word. **Karl Barth** famously attacked Schleiermacher’s theology of consciousness in the **Römerbrief** and the **Church Dogmatics**, accusing it of being anthropology rather than theology, yet Barth also inherits Schleiermacher’s insistence that dogmatics be a unified, scientific whole oriented to Christ. Reformed theologians can therefore appreciate Schleiermacher’s desire to articulate theology as a rigorous discipline in conversation with modern philosophy, while firmly rejecting his anthropocentric foundation and his dilution of confessional content into expressions of feeling.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam the safest opening move is to identify **Schleiermacher** succinctly as the father of modern **liberal Protestant theology**, who responds to **Kant** and the Enlightenment by grounding religion in the *Gefühl* of absolute dependence and constructing a comprehensive **Dogmatics** around the Christian community’s self-consciousness. It is acceptable to say that he is brilliant, historically decisive, and pastorally serious about the modern cultured despisers, as in **On Religion**, while immediately noting that his method represents a radical departure from **Reformed** confessionalism because it relocates the foundation of theology from God’s self-attesting Word to religious experience. Examiners will appreciate clear statements such as, For Schleiermacher, doctrine is a second-order expression of Christian piety, not a divinely revealed deposit, and His Christology redefines redemption as the communication of God-consciousness rather than penal substitutionary atonement. These phrases are safe if coupled with critical evaluation grounded in **Westminster** standards.

There are several phrases that require caution or qualification. The term *Gefühl* should not be translated simply as emotion; it is a pre-reflective, holistic **feeling of absolute dependence**, and treating it as mere sentiment would oversimplify his project in a way examiners may challenge. Similarly, one must avoid unqualified praise of his concept of **revelation**; describing revelation as the self-unfolding of God-consciousness in Christ and the church must be immediately contrasted with Scripture as inspired, verbal revelation in **Reformed** theology. Another landmine is to claim that Schleiermacher denies the **Trinity** or the deity of Christ; he formally affirms both, but he marginalizes the Trinity and reinterprets Christ’s uniqueness, so the criticism must be that he empties these doctrines of their classical metaphysical content. Examiners may also probe misunderstandings such as the idea that Schleiermacher is simply a subjectivist individualist; in fact, he is strongly **ecclesial**, making the community’s piety rather than the isolated individual the locus of theology.

A common student mistake is to oppose **Schleiermacher** and **Barth** too sharply without acknowledging Barth’s own indebtedness to Schleiermacher’s concern for scientific **Dogmatics** and for Christocentric concentration. The safer contrast is to say that Barth radicalizes the turn to revelation by relocating it from human consciousness to the sovereign act of God’s Word, refusing Schleiermacher’s anthropological starting point. Another error is to speak as if Schleiermacher introduces experience into theology for the first time; patristic and **Reformed** traditions always cared about piety and spiritual experience, but they subordinated it to Scripture and dogma. The examiner may also exploit any vagueness about his view of **atonement**; one must be ready to say clearly that he rejects penal substitution and treats the cross as the supreme expression of Christ’s God-consciousness, a view sharply at odds with **Calvin** and the Westminster standards. Staying alert to these pressure points, the candidate should consistently articulate Schleiermacher’s system on its own terms, then measure it by classical Reformed commitments.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, **Schleiermacher** must be acknowledged as a historically pivotal theologian who took seriously the crisis of **modernity** after **Kant**, the communal nature of faith, and the need for a disciplined, integrated **Dogmatics**, yet his fundamental move to ground theology in the *Gefühl* of absolute dependence rather than in the self-attesting **Word of God** represents a non-negotiable rupture with Reformed orthodoxy: it relativizes Scripture, redefines revelation as religious consciousness, reduces sin to disturbance of God-consciousness, evacuates the penal and substitutionary character of the atonement, and marginalizes the ontological **Trinity**, so when pressed I would affirm his diagnostic insight that theology must face modern historical and philosophical challenges honestly, but I would firmly deny that Christian doctrine is a descriptive science of experience and would instead insist that it is a normative exposition of Gods triune self-revelation in **Christ** through the inspired Scriptures, by which both church and culture are judged and renewed.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Friedrich Schleiermacher** is the paradigmatic modern liberal theologian who grounds religion in the *Gefühl* of absolute dependence and reconstructs Christian **Dogmatics** as a description of the churchs self-consciousness after **Kant**.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1768 in Breslau, educated at Halle, pastor and professor in **Berlin**, and dies in 1834 as leading figure of German **Romantic** theology.
- **On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers** 1799 defends religion as intuition and feeling of the infinite to the Enlightenment elite.
- **The Christian Faith** 1821/22, 2nd ed. 1830 is his major **Dogmatics**, deriving doctrines from Christian religious self-consciousness rather than from a revealed canon.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- For **Schleiermacher**, theology starts from the **feeling (*Gefühl*) of absolute dependence**, an immediate religious self-consciousness that precedes doctrine.
- He treats **revelation** as the God-consciousness of **Christ** communicated through the **church**, with Scripture as its earliest normative expression but not as an infallible verbal deposit.
- Theology is an empirical, descriptive science of the Christian communitys piety, shaped by **historical** and **psychological** analysis rather than by deductive exegesis of Scripture alone.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- He redefines **religion** as intuition and feeling of the infinite, rejecting both metaphysical speculation and mere moralism in favor of *Gefühl*.
- He recasts **Christology** so that Christ is unique by virtue of perfect **God-consciousness**, with salvation as the communication of this consciousness to the church.
- He relocates **revelation and Scripture** from external propositional speech to the inner life of the community, treating doctrines as second-order expressions of piety.
- He marginalizes the **Trinity**, placing it at the end of **The Christian Faith** as a summary of Christian experience rather than as central ontological truth.
- He denies penal **substitutionary atonement**, understanding the cross as the supreme expression and transformative influence of Christs God-consciousness rather than satisfaction of divine justice.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- **Reformed** examiners will press his shift from Scripture as principium to **religious experience** as the source and norm of theology.
- His view of **sin and atonement** as disturbance and restoration of God-consciousness clashes with **Westminster** teaching on guilt, wrath, and penal substitution.
- His treatment of the **Trinity** and attributes of **God** as phenomenological expressions of dependence undermines classical theism and Nicene orthodoxy.
- His harmonizing vision of **church and culture** underestimates antithesis and the noetic effects of sin emphasized by **Kuyper** and **Van Til**.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Schleiermacher vs Barth on revelation** contrasts consciousness-based liberalism with Word-based dialectical theology, even as Barth inherits Schleiermacher’s concern for Christocentric Dogmatics.
- **Schleiermacher vs Bavinck on dogmatics** highlights experience-shaped liberal method versus Scripture-rooted Reformed confessionalism.
- **Schleiermacher vs Calvin on atonement** contrasts transformative God-consciousness with vicarious, penal **substitution** before a holy God.
- **Schleiermacher vs Van Til on authority** pits autonomous religious consciousness against the self-attesting **Triune** Word of God in Scripture.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- **Schleiermacher** offers a sophisticated and historically influential theology of Christian consciousness, but from a Reformed Westminster standpoint his anthropocentric method and redefinition of revelation, sin, and atonement mark a decisive departure from biblical and confessional orthodoxy.
