### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andrew A. Sandlin emerges as a contemporary voice within **Reformed public theology**, formed at the nexus of **Van Til’s presuppositional apologetics**, **Kuyperian cultural vision**, and the controversial but generative legacy of **Christian Reconstructionism**. His early public work within the **Chalcedon Foundation** in the 1990s placed him in proximity to **R. J. Rushdoony**, whose insistence on **biblical law** as the architecture for a Christian social order pressed Sandlin to treat theology as civic instruction under **Christ’s lordship over all of life**. This Reconstructionist matrix was complemented by the broader **neo-Calvinist** stream of **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Dooyeweerd**, from which Sandlin drew the language of **sphere sovereignty**, **creational structures**, and the **antithesis** between covenantal obedience and unbelief. To that heritage he adds a rhetorical and pastoral accent that emphasizes **anti-gnostic creational piety**, the nobility of **callings in culture**, and the pre-political givenness of **family, worship, and work** under **covenantal order**.

His methodological stance is self-consciously **presuppositional** in the **Van Tilian** sense. The knowledge of God arises from the **triune God’s self-revelation**, and all intellectual labor is covenantally situated in either **obedience** or **autonomy**, what Van Til called the **antithesis**. That apologetic stance underwrites Sandlin’s public arguments for a thoroughgoing **epistemic theonomy**, in which the standards of **truth, justice, and beauty** are not discovered by neutral reason but are received from **Scripture** and the created pattern of **creational law**. Unlike some hardline theonomic construals, Sandlin frequently emphasizes the moral intelligibility of creation and therefore gestures toward a **biblically normed natural law**, a move that sets him in conversation with classical **Reformed scholastic** appeals to **lex naturalis** and with modern retrievals of **natural law** under **Scripture’s supremacy**.

Institutionally, Sandlin’s founding leadership in the **Center for Cultural Leadership** in the early 2000s signaled a pivot from narrow policy prescriptions to a more capacious **cultural leadership** program. He convened conferences, essays, and lecture series from the 2000s to the 2020s that address **sexual ethics**, **public justice**, **education**, and the restoration of a properly Christian **Christendom**. His corpus is more public-theological than technical-dogmatic, composed of essays, short monographs, and lectures that translate **Reformed orthodoxy** into the civic and cultural idiom of the late modern West.

#### 2. Key works, interlocutors, and sustained concerns
Sandlin’s representative writings accrue across three venues that define his contribution: first, essays and reports with the **Chalcedon Foundation** in the late 1990s and early 2000s that rehearse the classic **Reconstructionist** themes of **biblical law**, **covenantal sanctions**, and **postmillennial hope**; second, the ongoing publications and lectures of the **Center for Cultural Leadership** from the 2000s to the 2020s, where he refines a **creational Christianity** focused on the **cultural mandate** and **sphere sovereignty**; third, editorial and pastoral introductions to reprints of **Rushdoony** and allied figures between the late 1990s and 2000s, where he clarifies the pedagogical, not merely programmatic, aim of **Christendom** under **Christ’s kingship**. Across these platforms his recurring dialogue partners include **Greg Bahnsen** on the hermeneutics of **law and gospel**, **Dooyeweerd** on the architecture of **creational norms**, and **Van Til** on **covenantal epistemology**, while more recent debates include probing engagement with **Two Kingdoms** theology and with the rhetoric of **Christian nationalism**.

A structured concern running through Sandlin’s oeuvre is the rejection of **modern gnosticism**, by which he means the cultural devaluation of **creation**, **bodily life**, and **ordinary vocations**. Against this dualism he proposes an **incarnational realism** in which the **Word made flesh** sanctifies creaturely life and restores the integrity of **household**, **economy**, and **polity** under **divine law**. This anti-gnostic polemic supplies the metaphysical ballast for his teaching on **sexual complementarity**, **marriage and childrearing**, **productive labor**, and the civic good of **ordered liberty**. Theologically, it allows him to emphasize **creation-fall-redemption-consummation** as the grammar of the **gospel of the kingdom**, rendering salvation not an escape from creation but its rectification in Christ.

#### 3. Doctrinal architecture: law, gospel, and kingdom
At the doctrinal core of Sandlin’s project is a Reformed synthesis of **law and gospel** ordered to **public ethics** under the **kingship of Christ**. He defends the **third use of the law** as a guide for sanctified obedience not only in the church but also in culture. For Sandlin, the **Mosaic moral law** retains normative authority as a specification of creational justice, while the **judicial laws** possess enduring moral principles that can and should inform contemporary jurisprudence. This is a classically **theonomic** thesis, though Sandlin often articulates it with a **Kuyperian** sensibility for differentiated **spheres** and the prudential reform of positive law. He thus advocates a distinctly **biblical jurisprudence** animated by **lex rex**, in which the state is ministerial, lawbound under God, and limited, while the **church** and **family** operate with God-given competencies that the state must not usurp.

Eschatologically, Sandlin espouses **postmillennialism**, not as a simplistic historical optimism but as a covenantal confidence that the **Great Commission** and **Spirit-wrought regeneration** will leaven history. The **kingdom of God** is both already and advancing toward fullness, such that cultures may be genuinely discipled and laws genuinely reformed under **Christ’s lordship**. This eschatological horizon prevents his program from collapsing into moralism. The **gospel** is the engine of cultural renewal, producing repentance and obedience that then reshapes customs, institutions, and laws. Unlike **Lutheran two kingdoms** dualisms or certain modern **Reformed 2K** formulations, Sandlin refuses a bifurcation of sacred and secular, insisting with **Kuyper** that not one square inch lies outside **Christ’s lordship**.

Anthropologically and politically, Sandlin retrieves a covenantal view of **human nature** as imago Dei situated in a web of **covenants**. The **covenant of creation** grounds the goods of **marriage**, **procreation**, and **labor**, while the **covenant of grace** renews fallen image-bearers and refashions common life through the sanctifying power of **the Spirit**. Civil society is thus not a secular artifact but a sphere of **creational obligation** open to **special revelation**. In this light Sandlin defends the permanence of **creational norms** and a chastened use of **natural law** subordinate to **Scripture**, thereby seeking to avoid both biblicist positivism and secular rationalism.

#### 4. Ecclesial practice, education, and cultural formation
Sandlin’s ecclesial emphasis falls on catechesis for **cultural leadership**, urging churches to train men and women for **public faithfulness**. He repeatedly underscores **Lord’s Day worship** as the fountain of cultural life, the locus where the **Word** and **sacrament** form citizens of the **kingdom**. Yet he presses beyond liturgy to the formative power of **Christian education** and **homeschooling**, both as acts of obedience to **Deuteronomy 6** and as resistance to secular catechesis. Here his kinship with **Rushdoony** and **Schaeffer** is evident, but he integrates a more systematic **sphere sovereignty** framework so that the family, church, school, and enterprise have discrete mandates.

In economics and public life Sandlin articulates a **creational political economy** that prizes **private property**, **vocational freedom**, and **charity** without statist compulsion, all under a canopy of **biblical justice**. He argues that state overreach corrodes the God-ordained spheres of **family** and **church**, distorting the moral ecology that underwrites social flourishing. By re-centering **household economy**, encouraging entrepreneurship, and defending **religious liberty**, he seeks to rebuild the basic mediating institutions that constitute a Christian social order. The guiding axiom remains **Christendom**, not as coercive confessionalism but as a civilization pervaded by public acknowledgment of **Christ’s authority**, **biblical law** as moral grammar, and civic virtues formed by **gospel grace**.

#### 5. Scripture, nature, and culture: a triangulated account
A defining feature of Sandlin’s project is a threefold coordination of **Scripture**, **nature**, and **culture**. Scripture is supreme, God-breathed, the principium cognoscendi of faith and practice. Nature is the intelligible order of creation, replete with **creational law** and accessible to reason illumined by **revelation**. Culture is the historical outworking of obedient or rebellious hearts within that created order. Sandlin resists both **biblicism** that ignores the created structures and **secular natural law** that displaces **Scripture**. He wants a confessional **Reformed catholicity** that can affirm **lex naturalis** along the lines of **Turretin** and **Calvin’s duplex cognitio Dei**, while keeping the antithetical edge of **Van Til’s** insistence that no fact is religiously neutral.

This triangulation animates his polemics against **expressive individualism** and **therapeutic moral deism**, which he regards as catechetical fruits of a culture that has lost the tether to **creation** and **covenant**. The antidote is not culture war for its own sake but **creational Christianity** that prizes **household piety**, **Sabbath** sanctification, **catechesis**, and **stewardship** of land, craft, and neighborhood. These modest practices, ordered to **kingdom** ends, yield long-term civic consequence. In that sense Sandlin’s strategy is Augustinian and postmillennial at once, leveraging **ordo amoris** to re-habituate peoples toward the **Summum Bonum** revealed in **Christ**.

#### 6. Engagements and distinctions within the Reformed family
Sandlin’s engagement with **Two Kingdoms** theology is clarifying. He agrees with classic **Reformed twofold government** that distinguishes the administration of the **church** and the **commonwealth**, yet he resists modern renderings that assign **Scripture’s authority** almost exclusively to the churchly sphere. Against proposals that construe civil life as regulated only by a thin **natural law**, he argues that Scripture is publicly relevant as the charter of **justice**, while natural law is reliable only within a covenantal frame. He further worries that certain **2K** approaches functionally secularize the polity, muting the **public claims of Christ**.

In current debates over **Christian nationalism**, Sandlin offers both sympathy and caution. He shares the desire for the public acknowledgment of **Christ’s kingship** and the recovery of **Christendom**, yet he insists that any nationalism must be chastened by **catholic ecclesiology**, **covenantal ethics**, and **sphere sovereignty**. Theonomy for Sandlin is never merely the imposition of biblical words into statute but the patient, Spirit-led renewal of people and institutions according to **biblical justice**. His proximity to **Rushdoony** and **Bahnsen** is evident in the hermeneutic of **law’s continuity**, yet his Kuyperian instincts yield a softer posture toward institutional pluralism and prudence, where **positive law** manifests **moral law** through historically situated judgments.

#### 7. Theological retrievals and constructive accents
Constructively, Sandlin contributes to contemporary **Reformed retrieval** through his sustained defense of **classical theism**, a covenantal reading of **providence**, and a public application of **divine law**. He aligns with **Reformed orthodoxy** in affirming **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity**, which anchor his critique of modern statism and voluntarism. God’s unchanging righteousness, he argues, demands legal and institutional forms that reflect **ordered liberty** rather than arbitrary power. Moreover, his promotion of **household economy** and **sabbatical rhythms** retrieves **Old Testament** wisdom for new-covenant practice under **Christ**.

Sandlin also re-centers the **Great Commission** as a cultural charter. Discipling the nations requires catechizing them in everything Christ commanded, which includes **justice**, **mercy**, and **faithfulness**. Here he follows **Calvin’s Institutio** in locating civil order within **divine providence**, while pressing beyond Calvin’s sixteenth-century constraints to argue for robust **religious liberty** and free exercise within a plural society being discipled over time. His insistence on **practical theology** means he pays constant attention to **habitus** and **virtue**, invoking a Reformed version of **MacIntyre’s** insight that communities must recover their internal goods and traditions of practice.

#### 8. Limits, risks, and clarifications
No Reformed public theology can escape the problem of **hermeneutics** in the application of **biblical law**. Sandlin is aware of the risks of an uncritical transfer of **Mosaic judicials** to modern nation-states. He usually speaks in terms of abiding **moral principles**, prudential application, and incremental reform. Still, his confidence in **postmillennial** cultural leavening can appear, to more cautious readers, as an over-realized expectation for the near-term political fruit of the **gospel**. Likewise, his anti-gnostic polemic, though salutary, must be disciplined by a robust doctrine of **cross-bearing**, ensuring that **suffering** and **pilgrimage** remain integral to Reformed spirituality even as cultures are discipled.

A further tension arises in the balance between **Scripture** and **natural law**. Sandlin’s willingness to retrieve **lex naturalis** under Scripture’s authority is commendable, yet it requires careful prolegomena on the noetic effects of sin and the role of **common grace**. His **Van Tilian** inheritance rightly rejects neutrality, but the same inheritance can be deployed to affirm thicker accounts of **creational knowledge** that are not reducible to biblicist proof texting. The best of **Reformed scholasticism** and **Kuyperian** thought can aid this calibration, such that nature is not eclipsed by grace but perfected by it, **natura non tollitur sed perficitur**.

Final Reformed and WTS evaluation. From within a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** frame, Sandlin’s strengths are clear: a **Van Tilian** insistence on **Christ’s lordship over all knowledge**, a **covenantal** integration of **law and gospel** in sanctification, and a **Kuyperian** recovery of **sphere sovereignty** and the **cultural mandate**. He offers a necessary antidote to privatized faith and modern **gnosticism**, and he shows how **catechesis**, **worship**, and **household economy** resource a public **Christendom** marked by humility and justice. The chief cautions concern the hermeneutical pathway from **Mosaic judicials** to modern penology, the danger of conflating historical **Christendom** with the **kingdom’s** eschatological peace, and the need to articulate **natural law** in a way that honors both **special revelation** and the noetic limits of fallen reason. A WTS-shaped alternative would welcome Sandlin’s **presuppositional** and **covenantal** commitments while urging greater emphasis on the pilgrim character of the church, a more restrained civil use of **biblical law** punctuated by prudence and common grace, and a Christ-centered doxology that keeps the church’s **worship and Word** as the fountain from which any cultural reformation may flow.
