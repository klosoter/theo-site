### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul Avis, born in 1947 and formed within late modern **Church of England** clerical and academic life, is best known as an Anglican ecclesiologist and ecumenist whose work spans the ferment of **post-Vatican II** developments and the stresses of the **Anglican Communion** after 2003. As General Secretary of the **Church of England’s Council for Christian Unity** from 1998 to 2011, founding editor of the journal **Ecclesiology**, and a frequent adviser to **Faith and Order** processes and bilateral dialogues such as **Anglican–Methodist** and **Anglican–Roman Catholic** conversations, he is as much a practical ecclesial statesman as a theorist of the **communio** paradigm. His method blends **ressourcement** retrieval of **patristic conciliarity** and **Reformation ecclesiology** with a chastened **critical realism** that treats ecclesial claims as authoritative yet fallible, tested by **Scripture**, **creed**, and **reception**. The Anglican triad of **Scripture, tradition, reason** functions in his work as a dynamic hermeneutical spiral, indebted to **Richard Hooker’s** juridical and theological prudence, and sharpened by ecumenical exchange with **Yves Congar’s** **communion ecclesiology** and **Avery Dulles’s** **models of the Church**.

Avis’s formative horizon is marked by a double fidelity: first, to the **Nicene–Chalcedonian** rule of faith embodied in the **Book of Common Prayer** and **Lambeth Quadrilateral**; second, to a principled Anglican **via media** that refuses confessional sectarianism while guarding the **creedal core**. He reads modernity through the lens of theologians like **Lesslie Newbigin** and philosophers of tradition like **Alasdair MacIntyre**, yet his epistemic stance remains ecclesially realist: the church is a visibly ordered **sacramental community** whose **apostolicity** is recognized by the church catholic through **conciliar processes**. His jurisprudential sense of **establishment** as a vocation for public witness is animated by a renewed **public theology** rather than by nostalgia for confessional statehood. Across his corpus, Avis negotiates between **Barth’s** Word-centeredness and **Zizioulas’s** eucharistic **koinonia**, seeking a catholicity that is simultaneously evangelical, canonical, and visibly ordered in **episcopal collegiality**.

#### 2. Early retrievals: Reformation roots and Anglican identity
Avis first staked his ground with **The Church in the Theology of the Reformers** in 1981, a compact yet programmatic retrieval of **Luther**, **Calvin**, **Cranmer**, and the early **English Reformation** as sources for a constructive **ecclesiology** that is thoroughly evangelical and deeply catholic. He highlights how **Word and sacrament** define the true church for the magisterial Reformers, how **discipline** and **order** serve the gospel, and how **apostolicity** pertains first to **apostolic doctrine** and then to **apostolic ministry**. His reading of **Calvin’s** collegial **episcopacy-in-presbytery** and **Cranmer’s** liturgical theology is used to disarm simplistic narratives that pit catholicity against reform, thereby positioning **Anglicanism** as a bridge tradition whose **visible unity** aim can honor both **sola Scriptura** and **conciliar** consensus. The book inaugurates Avis’s lifelong insistence that **Reformation ecclesiology** is not exhausted by confessional antagonisms but contains robust resources for **reconciled diversity**.

The subsequent **Anglicanism and the Christian Church** in 1988, revised in 2002, widened the historiographical lens. Here Avis surveys Anglican identity across eras, arguing for an **evangelical catholicity** that resists both **sectarian confessionalism** and **institutional reductionism**. His constructive thesis appeals to the **Lambeth Quadrilateral** as a minimal yet weighty charter for **visible unity**: **Scripture**, **creed**, **baptism and eucharist**, and the **historic episcopate** locally adapted. The **historic episcopate** is neither an ontological caste nor a guarantee of truth but a received and communicable **instrument of unity**, a formulation indebted to **Michael Ramsey’s** notion of the bishop as a focus of **koinonia**. By interpreting episcopacy through **reception** and **recognition**, Avis opens eco-pathways for mutual ministry recognition, anticipating agreements such as the **Porvoo Communion**, which gathered Anglicans and Lutherans into visible communion on the basis of convergent apostolicity.

#### 3. Symbol, sacrament, and authority in a critical age
With **God and the Creative Imagination** in 1999 and **The Anglican Understanding of the Church** in 2000, Avis joined doctrinal ecclesiology to a theology of **symbol** and **sacramentality**. The former explores metaphor, myth, and the **imaginative** dimension of faith, drawing on **Coleridgean** and **Ricoeurian** trajectories to show how **sacramental signs** mediate reality without collapsing sign and thing signified. The latter returns to **Word, sacrament, and order** as Anglican essentials, expounding **episcopal oversight** as pastoral, collegial, and mission-oriented. Here **mission** and **communion** are inseparable: the church is not merely a eucharistic society gathered, but a **missio Dei** people sent, whose **apostolicity** is verified by evangelization, catechesis, and a coherent pattern of **holy living**.

In **Church, State and Establishment** in 2001, Avis offers a nuanced apologia for a **soft establishment**, where the **Church of England** serves the whole nation through **public rites**, moral discourse, and representative presence, without coercive privileges that would violate **religious liberty**. Establishment is construed as **public theology** under law, accountable to civil society and the ecumenical church, rather than a sacral fusion of throne and altar. By holding together **sacramentality** and **public reason**, Avis refuses privatized ecclesiality and mounts a defense of the church as a public, visible, and responsible agent in a plural polity.

#### 4. Conciliar tradition, primacy, and the fire of criticism
Avis’s pivotal **Beyond the Reformation? Authority, Primacy and Unity in the Conciliar Tradition** in 2006 argues that the church’s unity must be secured through a revitalized **conciliarity**, in which **primacy** is exercised as **servus servorum** for the sake of communion. He reads the great councils and the **conciliar movement** as an unfinished resource for a differentiated **synodality** that balances local, provincial, and universal dimensions. The **Bishop of Rome** can be a primatial focus of unity only within a conciliar, canonical, and doctrinally bounded **communion**, not as unilateral jurisdiction. In Anglican terms, Avis correlates this with the **instruments of communion** such as the **Lambeth Conference**, the **Anglican Consultative Council**, and the **Primates Meeting**, proposing a thicker synodality that avoids both centralized fiat and congregational fissiparity.

Alongside this ecclesial vision, **Faith in the Fires of Criticism** in 2006 defends the **credibility of Christian doctrine** amid historical-critical and philosophical contestation. Avis articulates a chastened **foundationalism** anchored in **Scripture and the creeds**, enabled by a **critical realist** epistemology that welcomes inquiry while insisting on the church’s right to confess the **Incarnation**, **Trinity**, and **atonement**. The popular-level **The Identity of Anglicanism** in 2007 distills his program: an **evangelical catholic** Anglicanism defined by the **Trinitarian** and **Christological** core, ordered in **episcopacy**, and oriented to **ecumenical reconciliation**.

#### 5. Ecumenical method: receptive learning and differentiated consensus
In **Reshaping Ecumenical Theology** in 2010 and **Reconciling Theology** in 2013, Avis refines an ecumenical method that converges with and extends **receptive ecumenism**, associated with **Paul D. Murray**, and **differentiated consensus** found in **Lutheran–Catholic** dialogues. The key tools are **reception** as the church’s Spirit-led discernment of truth over time, and **recognition** as the mutual acknowledgment of sacramental and ministerial reality across communities. He argues that the way forward is neither doctrinal minimalism nor maximalist merger, but a **communion ecclesiology** capable of holding integrities together through **conciliar processes**, shared **creedal orthodoxy**, and convergences on **baptismal incorporation**, **eucharistic presence**, and **episcopal or presbyterial oversight** adapted for mutual recognition.

**In Search of Authority** in 2014 returns to the Anglican method, tracing how **authority** navigates between **Scripture’s primacy**, the **fathers and councils**, and **reasoned judgment** within synodical structures. Avis characterizes Anglicanism as canonically ordered fallibilism: it claims **teaching authority** through duly constituted **synods** and **episcopal oversight**, while acknowledging the provisionality of non-creedal determinations and the necessity of **reception** at local and global levels. In line with **Avery Dulles**, he insists on plural **models** that integrate juridical and mystical, herald and servant, communion and institution, refusing one-dimensional reduction.

#### 6. Anglican vocation, instruments of communion, and a hand on the tiller
With **The Vocation of Anglicanism** in 2016, Avis offers a concise manifesto for Anglican self-understanding in a polarized era. The **instruments of communion** are to be reimagined as councils of discernment rather than courts of last resort, privileging **consensus fidelium** over politicized block voting. He advocates for sustained ecumenical engagement with **Rome**, **Orthodoxy**, and the **historic Reformation** churches, urging Anglicans to be a hinge tradition for **visible unity**. As editor of **The Oxford Handbook of Ecclesiology** in 2018, Avis curates a state-of-the-field mapping that consolidates **communion ecclesiology** as the standard grammar while exposing its unresolved tensions around primacy, synodality, and contextual mission.

During and after the **Anglican Communion** disputes that intensified from 2003, Avis pressed for **communion with integrity**: robust **doctrinal core** centered in **creedal orthodoxy** and the **Scriptural canon**, room for conscientious diversity on secondary matters, and patient **reception** of contested developments in ministries and ethics within an accountable **conciliar** frame. His ecclesial diplomacy stresses **recognition** before judgment, **listening** before legislation, and the avoidance of hasty **impaired communion** declarations that bypass the **koinonia** discipline of shared counsel and common prayer.

#### 7. Doctrinal contours: apostolicity, episcopacy, sacramentality, and public witness
Theologically, Avis’s ecclesiology coalesces around four foci. First, **apostolicity** is primordially **apostolic doctrine**, normed by **Scripture** and the **creeds**, and secondarily **apostolic ministry**, recognized through **canonical succession** and **effective oversight**. He rejects essentialist notions of **apostolic succession** as quasi-metaphysical transmission, urging instead a **communional** understanding in which succession is a pattern of **teaching, sanctifying, and governing** acknowledged by the whole church through **reception**. Second, **episcopacy** is a sign and instrument, not an end; its **collegiality** with presbyters and laity is intrinsic. Drawing on **Michael Ramsey** and **Richard Hooker**, he portrays bishops as focal ministers of **unity and mission**, whose authority is bounded by **scriptural** and **conciliar** norms and by the **salus animarum**.

Third, **sacramentality** pervades Avis’s theology of the church. Baptism enacts **incorporation into Christ** and the one **koinonia**, while the eucharist realizes the church as **communio sanctorum** gathered by the **Word** in the Spirit. His interaction with **John Zizioulas** is appreciative yet critical: the church is indeed eucharistic, but its **personal-relational ontology** must not eclipse the givenness of **creedal** and **canonical** form. Fourth, on **public theology** and **establishment**, he contends that the church’s visibility includes its **civic vocation**. A chastened **establishment** can serve **mission** by keeping the church in public view, providing rites in civil life, and witnessing to the **common good** without coercion, all under the gospel’s critique. Across these themes, he defends **women’s ordination** and inclusive participation as expressions of **baptismal ecclesiology**, adjudicated by **Scripture** read canonically and by **conciliar discernment**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: catholicity without capitulation
Avis’s constructive proposals emerge through dialogue with major interlocutors. From **Yves Congar** he adapts **communion ecclesiology** and **reception**; from **Avery Dulles** the plurality of **models** that prevent ecclesiological reductionism; from **Joseph Ratzinger** a respect for **primacy** and doctrinal **continuity** tempered by Anglican synodality; from **John Zizioulas** the centrality of **eucharistic koinonia** corrected by canonical and doctrinal norms; from **Karl Barth** a warning against immanentizing the church’s visibility apart from **the Word of God**. Within Anglicanism, he mines **Hooker’s** juridical wisdom, **F. D. Maurice’s** social vision of **universal church**, **Michael Ramsey’s** sacramental realism, and **Rowan Williams’s** apophatic patience about institutional totalization.

Debates that test these proposals include the nature of **visible unity** in relation to **truth**, the scope of **adiaphora** under **Scripture’s primacy**, the extent to which **episcopacy** is necessary for full communion, and the legitimacy of **establishment** in a pluralist democracy. Avis answers by doubling down on **conciliarity** and **reception**: truth claims remain determinative, yet they ripen through common discernment; unity is not optional because the gospel is public; bishops serve unity but do not exhaust apostolicity; establishment is an evangelical instrument under judgment. His insistence on **fallibilist authority** is meant to defend catholicity without surrendering to relativism, sustaining an Anglican vocation that is at once **evangelical** and **catholic**.

#### 9. Integration and limits: strengths under pressure
The integrative strength of Avis’s project is his refusal to let **communion** float free of **canon** or to let **order** eclipse **mission**. By holding **Word, sacrament, and polity** in one frame, he crafts an ecclesiology that is recognizably **Anglican** yet porous to the wider **oikoumene**. His embrace of **receptive ecumenism** avoids both polemical closure and doctrinal dilution, pressing for **differentiated consensus** that can sustain **mutual recognition** and **shared witness**. At the same time, his reliance on **conciliar processes** can appear optimistic where deep dogmatic divides persist, and his moderated case for **establishment** will not persuade traditions committed to a stricter **two-kingdoms** or **spirituality of the church** doctrine. Likewise, his defense of **women’s ordination** within a communion marked by asymmetrical reception exposes the limits of procedural conciliarity amid ontological disagreements about **orders**.

Yet even here, Avis’s governing instincts remain consistent: to submit every question to **Scripture and creed**, to process it through **synodality** open to the whole people of God, and to test outcomes by their capacity to preserve **communion in truth**. If his Anglican **via media** sometimes reads as negotiated peace rather than decisive victory, it is because his **communion ecclesiology** construes catholicity as a moral and spiritual discipline rather than as a triumph of one party’s theory of the church. The net result is a body of work that has supplied Anglicans and ecumenists with conceptual tools to imagine **visible unity** that is evangelical in content, catholic in form, and conciliar in method.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: gospel, polity, and unity under the Word
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** perspective, Avis’s contributions commendably elevate the **primacy of Scripture**, the **creedal core**, and the missionary telos of **communion ecclesiology**, and his demythologizing of **ontologized succession** accords with **presbyterial parity** as a legitimate apostolic form. His retrieval of **Reformation ecclesiology** and stress on **marks of the church** resonate with **Belgic Confession 29** and the **Westminster Confession of Faith 25**, and his critique of juridical supremacy in favor of **conciliar** accountability echoes **Calvin’s** vision of graded assemblies. Yet tensions remain. First, Avis’s normative appeal to the **historic episcopate** as an instrument of unity can appear to add a quasi-constitutive element to visible unity beyond the Reformed marks, risking an instrumental necessity that presses against **sola Scriptura** and the sufficiency of **Word, sacrament, and discipline**. Second, his program of **receptive ecumenism** with **Rome** presumes degrees of doctrinal convergence that many in the Reformed camp judge premature given ongoing differences over **justification**, **sacramental presence**, and **magisterial authority**. Third, his limited defense of **establishment** conflicts with Reformed accounts of the church’s **spiritual independence** and either a **two-kingdoms** or **sphere sovereignty** framing of church and state. Finally, his use of **adiaphora** and procedural **reception** to adjudicate contested developments, including **women’s ordination**, can look like proceduralism where Reformed interlocutors would require explicit **biblical warrant** under the **regulative principle**. A Reformed alternative would affirm Avis’s catholic instinct for **visible fellowship** while grounding unity more decisively in confessional **truth**, presbyterial **polity**, and covenantal **discipline**, taking conciliarity to be ministerial and declarative under the living **Word of God**, and content with intercommunion among churches sharing the **Reformed confessions** where wider institutional **communion** remains the hopeful but not necessary horizon.
