### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Mark D. Thompson is a contemporary **evangelical Anglican** theologian whose intellectual home is the **Sydney Diocese** and institutional base is **Moore Theological College**, where he has taught since the 1990s and has served as principal since 2013. His formation is decisively shaped by a retrieval of **Reformation dogmatics**, especially **Martin Luther** and **John Calvin**, coupled with a disciplined attention to the modern debate about **hermeneutics** and **revelation** after **Karl Barth**. Thompson came of age theologically amid late modern skepticism about textual meaning, the rise of **postliberalism** and **reader-response** theories, and a renewed evangelical interest in **speech-act theory** as a way to describe **Scripture as divine address**. His theological method is dogmatic yet historically self-aware: the **doctrine of Scripture** must be located under the **Trinity** and the **economy of revelation**, but it must also be tested in the furnace of **preaching**, **ecclesial catechesis**, and **mission**. In this respect, Thompson stands in the stream of **Sydney Anglican** commitments to **expository preaching**, **biblical authority**, and the formative legacy of figures such as **Broughton Knox** and **Peter Jensen**, while engaging broader conversations with **Kevin J. Vanhoozer** and **John Webster** about **divine communicative action**.

The basic wager of Thompson’s project is summed up in the thesis that the **God who speaks** is the ground of the **clarity, authority, and efficacy of Scripture**. He distances himself both from a thin **positivism** that imagines meaning as self-evident without the **Spirit’s illumination** and from **hermeneutical skepticism** that dissolves meaning into interpretive communities. Instead he charts a theological realism: the **triune God** makes himself known in and through the **canonical Scriptures**, and this divine act of self-communication is fitting to God’s character and sufficient for the church’s knowledge of **salvation**. The method is therefore doxological, ecclesial, and missionary. He reads **Luther’s claritas** not as a rational transparency simpliciter but as the confidence that **God’s speech** reaches its appointed ends, granting the church what **Augustine** called a rightly ordered love and understanding through **scriptural pedagogy**.

#### 2. A Clear and Present Word: retrieving perspicuity for late modern readers
Thompson’s central monograph, **A Clear and Present Word: The Clarity of Scripture** (2006), offers a patient dogmatic and historical argument for **perspicuity**. He retrieves **Luther’s** distinction between **outer clarity** and **inner clarity**, insisting that the first concerns the public, linguistic availability of the canonical text, while the second concerns the **Spirit’s** effectual work to render the heart receptive to the saving message. The result is a richly textured doctrine in which **Scripture’s clarity** is neither collapsed into human technique nor suspended upon a subjectivist decision. Thompson treats **claritas** as a function of **divine communicative action**: the God who wills to be known has accommodated himself to our capacities and, by the **Spirit**, ensures Scripture’s intelligibility for faith and obedience.

A significant contribution of the book is its engagement with modern objections. Thompson takes up **postliberal** claims about meaning as intra-ecclesial grammar, the **reader-response** stress on interpretive communities, and continental worries about **language and indeterminacy** associated with **Derrida**, **Gadamer**, and **Fish**. While appreciative of the insight that readers are situated, he counters that hermeneutical finitude does not entail hermeneutical despair. By deploying the heuristic of **speech-act theory** drawn from **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, and resonating with **Vanhoozer’s** theology of **divine action in discourse**, Thompson argues that the canonical locutions of Scripture carry divine illocutions that are stable and purposive, oriented toward a determinate **gospel** end. The **missionary horizon** is explicit: if God has spoken clearly, the translation of the Bible and the ordinary ministry of the Word are justified in their expectation of understanding across cultures, extending the **Reformation** conviction about **perspicuity** into late-modern global contexts.

#### 3. Barth, the Word of God, and evangelical critique
Thompson’s work is consistently in conversation with **Karl Barth’s** doctrine of the **Word of God**. In a 2008 contribution to **Engaging with Barth: Contemporary Evangelical Critiques**, he expresses appreciation for Barth’s Christological concentration and insistence that revelation is a divine gift, yet he resists the destabilizing implications of the **threefold form of the Word** if it leads to a relativizing of the **canonical text** by making divine self-revelation only contingently attached to Scripture. The question is not whether God is free but how divine **freedom** has covenanted to operate through **inscripturated words**. Thompson deploys **Calvin’s** attention to **autopistia Scripturae** and **Luther’s** emphasis on the Spirit’s **testimonium internum** to argue that the **clarity** and **authority** of Scripture are not subsequent to a fresh revelatory event but belong to the sanctified, canonical status of the biblical writings themselves.

This critique is measured and churchly. Thompson draws on **John Webster’s** later dogmatics of **Holy Scripture** as a creaturely reality sanctified by God, noting convergences in affirming the **objectivity** of the text and the **subjective** work of the Spirit in illumination. By stressing Scripture’s clarity as God’s good act, he avoids both **biblicism** that divorces text from the **triune** God and a **Barthian** stance that risks treating the text as a site awaiting a new event of Word. The upshot is a framework in which **perspicuity** empowers **preaching**, grounds **catechesis**, and anchors **assurance** without ceding the field to hermeneutical romanticism or to an ecclesial magisterium.

#### 4. The Doctrine of Scripture: dogmatic location and pastoral payoff
In **The Doctrine of Scripture** (2022), a concise yet full introduction within contemporary evangelical dogmatics, Thompson consolidates his account of **inspiration**, **authority**, **truthfulness**, **clarity**, **sufficiency**, and **illumination**. He places **Scripture** under the **economy of the Trinity**, arguing that the Father sends the Son and the Spirit to generate a community gathered by the **Word**, and that the **inspiration** of the biblical authors is a mode of the Spirit’s fitting work within providence. The classic terms **verbal plenary inspiration** and **concursive authorship** appear as guardrails, but the governing idiom is theological: **Scripture as divine address**. He endorses the traditional contours of **sola Scriptura** while articulating the role of **tradition** and **confession** as subordinate norms, echoing **Reformed** instincts without collapsing into a sola traditio.

Crucially, Thompson devotes space to **truthfulness** and the contested term **inerrancy**. His preference is to foreground the **trustworthiness** and **veracity** of God and therefore of God’s speech in Scripture, while acknowledging that **inerrancy** can serve as a useful shorthand when precisely defined to name Scripture’s incapacity to deceive in all that it affirms. He threads a pastoral needle: avoiding both defensive scholasticism and vague pietism. The practical accent remains: the **clarity** and **sufficiency** of Scripture license confident **expository preaching**, robust **evangelism**, and resilient **catechesis**. Here the **Sydney Anglican** commitment to the primacy of the Word in the church’s life is a quietly constant presence, giving Thompson’s dogmatics a lived ecclesial habitat.

#### 5. Hermeneutics, mission, and translation
A hallmark of Thompson’s work is its integration of **hermeneutics** with **mission**. The thesis of **perspicuity** is not an abstract property of texts; it is a claim about the **God who speaks**, aimed at the church’s calling to make the **gospel** known. Thompson presses against both postcolonial anxieties that deny common meaning across cultures and technocratic positivisms that ignore the role of the **Holy Spirit**. He leans on **Augustine’s** insight in De Doctrina Christiana that love of God and neighbor orders the interpretive task, while adopting modern tools such as **speech-act** analysis to describe how divine illocutions secure the ends of faith. The sacramental connection between **Scripture** and **preaching** is not construed in Roman terms but in the **Reformation** sense that the Word, read and proclaimed, is God’s instrument to create and sustain the church.

In this missional horizon, Thompson retrieves **Luther’s** insistence that the Bible belongs in the vernacular, undergirding global **Bible translation** with the confidence that the meaning God intends can be communicated faithfully without loss of saving clarity. He counters **relativism** not by claiming exhaustive comprehension but by confessing that God’s address achieves its appointed purpose. The resulting picture gives theological ballast to the ordinary ministries of the Word in local churches, while offering a principled account to academic interlocutors in **hermeneutics**, **linguistics**, and **philosophy of language**.

#### 6. Christology and the unity of Scripture
While the **doctrine of Scripture** is Thompson’s central public contribution, he consistently frames **Christology** as the center of Scriptural unity. Following **Luther’s** cross-centered hermeneutic and **Calvin’s** focus on the **mediatorial office** of Christ, he argues that the canon’s **perspicuity** is teleological and christocentric: Scripture is clear because it is ordered to the revelation of the **incarnate Son**, the one mediator whose person and work constitute the substance of the **gospel**. In essays and addresses, Thompson treats **substitutionary atonement** as the hermeneutical kernel that makes sense of the Bible’s soteriological idiom, resisting both **moral exemplarism** and **Christomonistic** reductions that evacuate the economy of its covenantal texture. The **Spirit’s illumination** is therefore not a private hunch but the ecclesially shared gift of being led to Christ in the Scriptures, echoing **John 16** and **1 Corinthians 2**.

This christological focus draws Thompson into appreciative conversation with **John Webster’s** later dogmatics, where the sanctified creatureliness of **Holy Scripture** stands under the Rule of Christ. It also creates a principled boundary with certain **Barthian** deployments of the **threefold Word**, insofar as these can sideline the canonical text’s role in naming and norming the knowledge of Christ. The unity of Scripture is canonically mediated, Spirit-illumined, and oriented to **Jesus Christ** as the telos of the divine communicative act, which is why **clarity** is inseparable from **sufficiency** for salvation and **edification**.

#### 7. Evangelical identity, Anglican retrieval, and public theology
As a leader in **Sydney Anglicanism**, Thompson has written and spoken extensively about **evangelical identity**, the **authority of Scripture** in Anglican formularies, and the pastoral implications of **doctrinal clarity**. He retrieves the **Thirty-Nine Articles** as a Reformation confession that codifies **sola Scriptura**, treats **preaching** as the church’s lifeblood, and orders ministry around the **Word and prayer**. Against both progressivist revisionism and anti-intellectual biblicism, he charts a path of **confessional evangelicalism** that interacts with late-modern culture in public, patient, and principled ways. The doctrinal core remains non-negotiable: the **trustworthiness**, **clarity**, and **sufficiency** of Scripture for the church’s teaching on salvation, ethics, and ecclesial order.

In public theology, this stance bears fruit in careful engagement with challenges to orthodox **Christology**, **anthropology**, and **ethics**. Thompson’s approach is to stabilize these debates by returning to **Scripture as divine address**, rather than by leaning on free-standing natural law or political theory. Yet he does not eschew reasoned argument: the call is to subject all reasonings to the **Word**, precisely because God has spoken clearly. His influence, accordingly, is felt both in the academy and in the training of pastors who carry an unembarrassed confidence in the Bible into a skeptical age.

#### 8. Conceptual tools and doctrinal synthesis
Two conceptual tools stand out across Thompson’s corpus. First, **divine communicative action** functions as a dogmatic nerve center. By viewing **inspiration**, **clarity**, and **authority** as modes of God’s speaking, he reframes debates away from merely textual phenomenology and toward **theology proper**, thereby restoring the link between **Scripture** and the living **God**. Second, **perspicuity** is reconceived as a missionary and pastoral doctrine. Its aim is not to guarantee ease but to anchor the church’s confidence that Scripture can be read, translated, preached, and obeyed by ordinary believers through the **Spirit’s** aid. Alongside these, Thompson deploys **speech-act theory** heuristically, treats **tradition** as an interpretive help but not a rival norm, and navigates the **inerrancy** discourse with a commitment to Scripture’s **truthfulness** that is both doctrinally thick and pastorally sensitive.

This synthesis exhibits coherence: **sola Scriptura** is not naked text but **Scripture-in-the-economy**, sanctified and deployed by the **triune God**. **Authority** is not an authoritarian imposition but the liberating rule of divine truth. **Clarity** does not eliminate mystery but grounds hope that God’s saving will is knowable in the **gospel** set forth in the canon. The end is **edification**, the building up of the church through the ordinary means of grace, especially the reading and proclamation of **Scripture**.

#### 9. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage point, Thompson’s account is substantially aligned with **WCF 1** on the **authority, sufficiency, and clarity of Scripture**, including the **Spirit’s** inward work to persuade and assure. His emphasis on **Scripture as divine address**, retrieval of **Luther and Calvin**, and pastoral accent on **preaching** resonate with the **Puritan** and **Reformed orthodox** tradition. Two tensions invite friendly refinement. First, while Thompson affirms **truthfulness** and is sympathetic to carefully defined **inerrancy**, a stronger, confessional articulation of **inerrancy** as an entailment of God’s own **veracity** in all the canonical assertions would further secure alignment with the **Chicago Statement** and with the **Reformed orthodox** account of Scripture’s perfection. Second, his dogmatic location might benefit from a more explicit **covenantal architecture**. The **Westminster** tradition situates Scripture within the **covenant of grace** as the external administration of God’s redemptive lordship; making this more programmatic would guard against any drift toward an abstract speech-ontology and would tie **perspicuity** more tightly to the covenantal economy of **revelation**. Nonetheless, the core impulse is deeply congenial to Reformed orthodoxy: the **triune God** stands, speaks, and acts in and through the **canonical Scriptures**, whose **clarity** and **authority** sustain Christian knowledge, faith, and obedience.
