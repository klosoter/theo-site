### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Jonathan A. Linebaugh emerges as a contemporary New Testament theologian whose work sits at the juncture of **Reformation retrieval** and the latest waves of **Pauline scholarship**. Educated and teaching within the University of Cambridge, his ecclesial location is Anglican yet he moves comfortably within the **Reformed tradition**, mining **Luther**, **Calvin**, and **Cranmer** while engaging the apocalyptic emphasis of **J. Louis Martyn** and the gift taxonomy of **John M. G. Barclay**. The historical setting is post–New Perspective: after **E. P. Sanders** and **James D. G. Dunn** reset discussions of Judaism and **justification**, and after **N. T. Wright** foregrounded covenant and vocation, Linebaugh advances a reading that foregrounds **apocalyptic grace** and **law and gospel** as the hermeneutical grammar of Paul. His method is deliberately integrative: philological rigor harnessed to the **Word of the Cross** in service of proclamation, a lectio that moves from text to **dogmatics** and then back to **liturgy**.

Linebaugh’s epistemic stance is that **scripture** not only informs but generates theological grammar. He treats Paul’s letters as a living address whose **gospel** is an event of divine speech, distinguishing **lex** and **evangelium** without dissolving the latter into moralism. The controlling conviction is **extra nos** righteousness, the righteousness of God that is not our own but is given and announced. His watchwords are **gift**, **promise**, and **deliverance**, with sin rendered as enslaving power rather than merely transgression. This **apocalyptic** register emphasizes God’s invasive agency that rescues from the present evil age, while **law and gospel** supplies a two-word hermeneutic that orders both reading and preaching.

#### 2. Works, influences, and the grammar of proclamation
The book-length touchstone is **The Word of the Cross: Reading Paul** (2023), a set of exegetical-theological essays that narrate Paul’s message by way of **Galatians**, **Romans**, **1 Corinthians**, and **Philippians**. Here Linebaugh argues that the **righteousness of God** is not a standard to achieve but a gift to receive, that **justification** is a performed divine verdict that locates the sinner **in Christ**, and that the cross announces a prior and unconditioned **grace**. This volume exhibits the method: each chapter moves from textual analysis to dogmatic concentration, concluding with implications for **proclamation** and **pastoral practice**. Across essays published between 2011 and 2022, he returns to the same grammar: the non-reciprocal **gift** highlighted by **Barclay**, the apocalyptic in-breaking emphasized by **Martyn**, and the **law-gospel** distinction retrieved from **Luther** and mediated into **Reformed** idioms via **Calvin** and **Cranmer**.

Linebaugh’s editorial work in **God’s Two Words: Law and Gospel in the Lutheran and Reformed Traditions** (2018) stages conversation between confessional streams, showing convergence on **justification sola fide** and divergence on the **third use of the law**. The anthology advances a thesis that **law and gospel** can function as a shared Reformation grammar, with **Reformed** adaptation rather than rejection. In line with **Cranmer’s** Book of Common Prayer, Linebaugh identifies a liturgical architecture that embodies the two words: confession under **law**, the **comfortable words** of absolution as **gospel**, and Eucharistic communion as participation in the **benefits of Christ**.

#### 3. Doctrinal loci: justification, grace, and union
The doctrinal center is **justification** as a divine verdict that is both forensic and transformative in effect though not in ground. Linebaugh insists on the Reformational order: the forensic **verbum** of **absolution** precedes and generates renewal, so that sanctification follows from union and **adoption** rather than constituting the basis of divine acceptance. He frequently invokes **simul iustus et peccator** to maintain the ongoing accusative function of the **law** even as the **gospel** frees and forms. The righteousness by which we stand is **alien righteousness**, **extra nos**, located in Christ’s person and history and imputed to the ungodly. This is not legal fiction; the verdict is constitutive because the divine **speech-act** accomplishes what it declares.

On **grace**, Linebaugh appropriates **Barclay’s** analysis of **gift** to argue that Paul proclaims incongruous grace, given without regard to worth, and efficacious grace, which delivers and creates a new situation of **freedom**. His essays on **Galatians** and **Philippians** foreground Christ’s self-giving as the grammar of divine action: the Son loved me and gave himself for me. Grace is not a commodity; it is God’s own self-gift in the crucified and risen Christ. This has ramifications for **faith** as reception: faith is not a meritorious condition but the empty hand that receives, or in his favored idiom, the ear that hears the **gospel**. The indicative precedes the imperative, and the imperative is evangelical rather than legal when it flows from **union with Christ**.

In regard to **union with Christ**, Linebaugh refuses the competitive framing of **substitution versus participation**. Drawing on **1 Corinthians** and **Romans**, he argues that participation in Christ’s death and life presupposes and is made possible by Christ’s substitution for us. The prepositions matter: Christ died for us so that we may live in him. The duplex gratia of **justification and sanctification** are distinct yet inseparable benefits of incorporation into Christ. This integration is driven by the **Word of the Cross** rather than a metaphysical schema; the result is a pastoral dogmatics that safeguards **assurance** while promoting actual **holiness**.

#### 4. Law and gospel, apocalyptic, and covenant
Linebaugh’s hallmark insistence on **law and gospel** supplies his hermeneutical backbone. The **law** is the revealed will of God that commands and accuses; the **gospel** is the executed promise that creates what it commands by announcing Christ. He borrows from **Luther** the clarity that the **law always accuses** while recognizing, with **Reformed** nuance, the positive moral will of God for the redeemed. He often points to **Cranmer’s** liturgical sequencing as evidence that the church’s prayer has embedded this two-word economy. The result is a reading of Paul that avoids the collapse of the **gospel** into new law and preserves the unconditionality of **grace**.

In the apocalyptic register, Linebaugh aligns with **J. Louis Martyn** and **Beverly Gaventa** in seeing Paul’s gospel as divine invasion and deliverance from cosmic powers. On **Galatians** 1 and **Romans** 5–8, he emphasizes that the **gospel** creates a new creation situation in which **sin**, **death**, and **the flesh** are dethroned. Yet he also welcomes **Barclay’s** corrective: apocalyptic does not render **gift** amorphous; rather it is a calibrated description of God’s incongruous generosity in Christ. Against certain versions of the **New Perspective** associated with **Wright**, he cautions that the covenantal narrative must not subordinate the radical verdict of **justification** to ecclesial boundary questions. The **righteousness of God**, for Linebaugh, is first God’s saving action in Christ for the ungodly, then the creation of a justified people.

On **covenant**, his work is more allusive than explicit. He frequently locates **Abraham** and the **promise** as grammar for **grace**, reading **Galatians 3–4** as promise-priority rather than law-economy. Here he tracks with classic **Reformed federal** instincts that place promise before command, while avoiding elaborate covenant systems. The emphasis falls on **Christ** as the seed of Abraham in whom the nations are blessed, which preserves continuity without diminishing the apocalyptic newness of the **gospel**.

#### 5. Scripture, proclamation, and liturgy
A consistent feature of Linebaugh’s writing is the movement from **exegesis** to **proclamation**. He treats the **gospel** as an event in the speaking of God, which gives his work a strong performative sense. Drawing on the pastoral genius of **Cranmer**, he portrays the **comfortable words** following confession as an enactment of **law and gospel**. In this sense, his Pauline theology is inseparable from homiletics: the **Word of the Cross** is preached as absolution that effects what it promises. The rhetorical shape of **Paul’s** letters, in his reading, is not accidental but paradigmatic for contemporary proclamation.

His essays often engage the **Book of Common Prayer** to illustrate how doctrinal convictions are discipled into desire and habit. The logic is **lex orandi, lex credendi**: the church learns **justification** by hearing and responding to the public announcement of **forgiveness**. In the Supper, the grammar of **gift** is enacted as participation in Christ’s body and blood given for you, thereby tying **substitution** to **participation** in a sacramental mode. This implicit sacramental theology serves his larger aim: to keep theology doxological and pastoral, even while engaging the sharp edges of **Pauline** debates.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates
In debate with the **New Perspective**, Linebaugh appreciates the rehabilitation of Second Temple Judaism yet resists the shrinkage of **justification** to ecclesiology. He appreciates **Wright’s** narrative but insists that **forensic justification** must not be eclipsed by vocation or covenant membership. Engaging **Barclay**, he underscores the incongruity of **grace** without denying its efficacy. With **Martyn** and **Gaventa**, he holds that **apocalyptic** names the discontinuous divine action that rectifies the ungodly. At the same time, he distances himself from any implication that apocalyptic entails a-historicity or rejection of Israel’s Scriptures; the **promise to Abraham** remains axial.

Within the Reformation spectrum, he is a friendly critic and translator between **Lutheran** and **Reformed** idioms. He cherishes **Luther’s** **law-gospel** clarity and **simul iustus et peccator**, while drawing on **Calvin’s** emphasis on **union with Christ** and the duplex **gratia**. He uses **Cranmer** as a common ancestor whose liturgy embodies a shared grammar. The result is not confessional flattening but a principled attempt to articulate a catholic Reformation core around **the righteousness of God** given in Christ and proclaimed to sinners.

#### 7. Exegetical touchpoints and theological payoffs
Exegetically, Linebaugh’s lodestars are **Galatians 2:15–21**, **Romans 3:21–26**, **Romans 5–8**, **1 Corinthians 1–2**, and **Philippians 3**. He reads these texts with attention to prepositions and genitives: the **faith of Jesus Christ** as the faithfulness of Christ for us and the believer’s faith in Christ as receptive participation. He emphasizes the polemical context of **Galatians** to sharpen the unconditionality of **grace** and the priority of **promise**. In **Romans**, the manifestation of the **righteousness of God** apart from the law is decisive for the ungodly, and in **1 Corinthians** the **Word of the Cross** discloses divine wisdom in weakness, undercutting all boasting. The payoff is a dogmatics of **boasting excluded**, where the only boast is in the Lord.

These exegetical judgments yield pastoral conclusions: assurance rooted in **Christ’s** finished work, sanctification as the fruit of **union**, and obedience as the grateful participation in the life of the new creation. The **indicative-imperative** sequence preserves the freedom of the **gospel** while empowering holy living. The law’s accusation drives to Christ; the gospel’s absolution births new obedience. This is not antinomianism but the evangelical order of **grace**.

#### 8. Contribution and ongoing influence
Linebaugh’s enduring contribution is to restate **Reformation soteriology** in contemporary Pauline terms without moralizing the **gospel** or historicizing it away. He has become a bridge figure between **apocalyptic** and **Reformed** ears, showing that divine invasion does not negate promise or **covenant** but fulfills them in Christ. His prose is resolutely textual yet confessional, inviting pastors and scholars to read **Paul** with ears tuned for proclamation. The 2023 consolidation in **The Word of the Cross** gathers more than a decade of essays and makes accessible a grammar of **law and gospel** that can sustain preaching and catechesis.

His influence extends through teaching, conference essays, and editorial work that convenes **Lutheran** and **Reformed** voices. By refusing the binary of **substitution versus participation** and holding together **forensic** and **effective** dimensions of salvation, he offers a coherent soteriological whole. His alignment with **Barclay** on gift incongruity and with **Martyn** on apocalyptic agency has made him a go-to interlocutor for those seeking a post–New Perspective account of **justification** that remains recognizably **Reformation**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Seminary vantage, the strengths are considerable: a robust **forensic justification**, clear **law-gospel** grammar, and a cross-centered **Christology** that safeguards **assurance**. His retrieval of **Cranmer** enriches Reformed piety by rooting doctrine in the church’s **liturgy**, and his integration of **substitution** and **participation** coheres with **union with Christ** and duplex **gratia**. Questions arise at three points. First, the maxim that the **law always accuses** risks muffling the confessional **third use of the law** as the normative guide for the regenerate, even if he affirms the imperative’s evangelical form. Second, the apocalyptic idiom can underexpose **covenant theology** and redemptive-historical continuity, especially the structuring role of the **covenants of promise** and their administration. Third, while his reading of **the righteousness of God** emphasizes divine action as gift, Reformed dogmatics will insist that this action includes the imputation of Christ’s **active and passive obedience**, lest the verdict be absorbed into effective grace. In sum, a largely convergent account of **grace** and **justification** that invites supplementation by explicit **covenant** categories and a sharpened account of the **third use**, all while preserving the primacy of the **Word of the Cross**.
