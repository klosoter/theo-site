### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
James S. Stewart, born in **1896** and serving the **Church of Scotland** until his death in **1990**, came of age in a Scottish world chastened by war, weary of Enlightenment **liberal Protestantism**, and newly attentive to the shock of **dialectical theology**. Trained in philology and ordained to parish ministry, then appointed **Professor of New Testament Language, Literature and Theology at Edinburgh** in **1947**, Stewart belonged to a generation that met a secularizing culture not with apologetic synthesis but with a recovered **kerygma**. His preaching and scholarship emerge within a **Neo-Orthodox** milieu shaped by **Karl Barth’s** primacy of revelation, **Emil Brunner’s** *Wortgeschehen* or **Word-event**, and a chastened use of historical criticism learned in conversation with **Rudolf Bultmann**. Stewart’s abiding method was neither historicist nor romantic but decisively **kerygmatic**: the living **Christ-event** confronts the hearer through **Scripture** and **proclamation** in the power of the **Spirit**, summoning faith and obedience.

Stewart’s method operates by **analogia fidei**, not **analogia entis**. Revelation controls exegesis, and exegesis serves proclamation. The preacher is a herald, not a religious genius. This stance is explicit in **Heralds of God** 1946 and **A Faith to Proclaim** 1953. Stewart’s theological grammar is dialectical: God’s **judgment and grace** coincide at the **cross**, history is invaded by eternity in the **resurrection**, and the Word of God stands over both church and world. Stewart, influenced by **P. T. Forsyth’s** insistence that revelation is realized in the **atonement**, and by **H. R. Mackintosh’s** high **Christology**, pursued a biblical theology where doctrinal content arises from the **kerygma** and returns to the pulpit as a summons.

#### 2. Ecclesial career and intellectual milieu
Stewart’s pastoral identity remained constant through his academic service. He was an able parish minister before teaching, and even as **Professor at Edinburgh 1947–1966** he wrote as a preacher-scholar. He served as **Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland** in **1963** and as a royal chaplain, embodying a public theology of proclamation. His scholarly labor extended to the translation of the **New English Bible** New Testament published in **1961**, where he contributed to the rendering of **Pauline** texts central to his theology. His context brought him into conversation with **Albert Schweitzer’s** apocalyptic reading of Paul, **C. H. Dodd’s** realized eschatology, and **Bultmann’s** existential hermeneutics. Stewart was neither a polemicist nor an eclectic; he received critical scholarship while refusing both rationalist reduction and anti-intellectual biblicism. The hallmark of his stance is **dialectical sobriety**: the **kerygma** carries objective content and historical purchase, yet God’s act remains free, sovereign, and eschatological.

#### 3. A Man in Christ: Pauline center and union
Stewart’s defining scholarly contribution, **A Man in Christ** 1935, argued that the center of **Pauline theology** is **union with Christ** rather than an isolated doctrine of **justification** or a vague **mysticism**. Engaging **Schweitzer’s The Mysticism of Paul the Apostle** and its apocalyptic participatory horizon, Stewart affirmed the participatory core yet insisted that Paul’s **en Christo** language is not absorption but a dynamic, covenantal, and ethical union grounded in the **cross and resurrection**. Union is personal and ecclesial, not pantheistic; it is effected by the **Spirit** and publicly signified in **baptism** and **Eucharist**. Stewart integrated **forensic justification** and **transformative sanctification** under the rubric of **union**, anticipating later Reformed retrievals of **duplex gratia**. The believer is incorporated into the **Christ-event** such that Christ’s **indicative** creates the **imperative**. Crucially, Stewart stabilizes participation within a christological objectivity: the **Vicarious Christ** is the locus of salvation; the believer’s union is not soteriological self-realization but reception of an alien righteousness and life.

Within this synthesis, Stewart emphasized the **representation-substitution** dialectic without collapsing into a single atonement theory. The **cross** is God’s judgment against sin borne by the **representative head**, and the **resurrection** is the eschatological vindication that constitutes the new **aeon**. Stewart’s exegesis attends to the Pauline **in Christ** formulae, the **Adam-Christ** antithesis in **Romans 5**, and the **cruciform** pattern of **Philippians 2–3**, developing a spirituality of participation that is thoroughly **kerygmatic** rather than mystical esoterica.

#### 4. The kerygma in wartime and aftermath
The preaching collections **The Strong Name** 1941 and **Heralds of God** 1946 were born amid **World War II** and its aftermath. Here Stewart pressed the **dialectic of judgment and grace**: the **Strong Name of Jesus** confronts the nations; the **cross** unmasks human pretension; the **resurrection** releases mission under the **Spirit**. In **Heralds of God** he set out a theology of preaching as **kerygma** not advice, gospel not religion, address not analysis. The preacher serves the **Word of God**, which is Christ himself attested in **Scripture** and enacted by **proclamation**. Stewart borrows from **Barth’s threefold Word** doctrine, yet gives it homiletical traction: the **written Word** bears authoritative witness; the **preached Word** becomes event (*Ereignis*) by the **Spirit**; and **Christ the living Word** remains Lord over the act. Against both moralism and technique, he insists that the **gospel** is an explosion into the present, a divine **Kairos** that requires decision.

This kerygmatic focus does not bypass doctrine. Stewart’s outlines are thick with **incarnation**, **atonement**, **resurrection**, and **Lordship**. But doctrine serves proclamation. He urges careful exegesis, the use of original **Greek** nuance, and pastoral imagination disciplined by **Christocentrism**. The result is a model of homiletics where theology breathes in the pulpit because theology is the content of God’s **self-witness** in Christ.

#### 5. A Faith to Proclaim: content and decision
In **A Faith to Proclaim** 1953 Stewart gathers the material content of the **kerygma** into a clear confession: the **incarnation** of the **Son**, the decisive **cross** as God’s judgment and mercy, the bodily yet eschatologically transformed **resurrection**, the present lordship of **Christ**, the gift of the **Spirit**, and the summons to **repentance and faith**. Here Stewart interacts critically with **Bultmann**: he welcomes demythologizing as existential translation of proclamation but resists any reduction of the **Resurrection** to mere mythic language for new possibility. For Stewart the empty tomb and appearances are historically real while transcending normal categories; the **eschatological inbreaking** does not negate but fulfills reality. Similarly, against **Dodd’s realized eschatology**, Stewart insists on the tension of the already and not yet, seeking a balanced **eschatology** where the **kingdom** is present in power yet still awaited in glory.

The decision Stewart seeks is not voluntarist. In line with **dialectical theology**, he treats faith as response to **God’s prior address**. Yet he remains pastoral and persuasive, urging hearers to yield to the **Christ-event** that, by the **Spirit**, makes dead sinners alive. This is **kerygma** as the divine call that creates the church, not the church’s deposit propping up religion.

#### 6. Scripture, criticism, and the Word of God
As a **New Testament professor**, Stewart stood between traditional confessional exegesis and the emerging historical-critical consensus. He affirmed the **authority of Scripture** as the normative witness to **Christ**, yet did not ground that authority in **inerrancy** or a prior theory of **inspiration**. Instead, following **Barth** and in debate with **Bultmann**, he affirmed **Scripture** as the instrument of the **Word-event**. His work on the **New English Bible** New Testament in **1961** displays this approach: a concern for idiomatic English that communicates the **kerygma’s** force, attention to textual and lexical matters, and an assumption that clarity aids proclamation. Stewart’s lectures frequently deployed the **indicative-imperative** structure of Pauline ethics, modeling a canonical reading where **gospel** grounds **obedience**.

This posture allowed critical engagement without skepticism. Stewart could acknowledge the compositional complexity of the **Gospels**, the theological shaping of **Acts**, and the contingencies of **Paul’s** letters while holding that the **Spirit** binds the witness to the **living Christ**. He thus maintained a robust **preaching** practice in the very era when some predicted preaching’s demise under criticism. For Stewart, the **Word of God** does not wait upon scholarly certitude; it creates its own hearing.

#### 7. Ecclesial life, sacrament, and spirituality
Though not a systematician, Stewart’s ecclesial instincts are recognizably **Reformed**. The church is the community gathered by the **Word and Spirit**, tasked with **witness** in the world. His sacramental theology, woven into sermons, reflects a classic **Reformed means-of-grace** emphasis: **baptism** as incorporation into **union with Christ**, and the **Lord’s Supper** as participation in the **living Christ** through the **Spirit**, nourished by **Scripture** and **proclamation**. He avoided speculation about metaphysics of presence, preferring to anchor sacrament in **kerygma** and **pneumatology**. Spirituality for Stewart is cruciform and missionary. The **cross** forms character; the **resurrection** empowers joy; the **Spirit** drives service. He linked personal piety to public righteousness, urging a gospel witness credible in the marketplace and academy alike.

Ethically, Stewart pressed the **indicative-imperative**: be what you are in **Christ**. He preached the sanctifying **union** that engenders holiness, integrating **justification** with **sanctification**. This spirituality is not pietist retreat but the mobilization of a people under the **Lordship of Christ**, sent as heralds into a suffering world.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and development
Stewart’s formative interlocutors illuminate his development. From **Barth** he learned the primacy of **revelation** and the threefold **Word of God**. From **Brunner** he borrowed the existential grammar of **encounter** while keeping a more concrete **Christology**. He rejected **Schweitzer’s** tendency to subordinate ethics to apocalyptic but welcomed the reclamation of **participation**. He appreciated **Dodd’s** literary insight while resisting eschatological flattening. He sparred implicitly with **Bultmann**, adopting the seriousness of existential address but refusing to evacuate **resurrection** into mythic cipher. Within Scotland he stood downstream from **Forsyth** and **Mackintosh**, with their cross-centered **revelation** and high **Christology**, and he embodied a Church of Scotland tradition concerned for preaching as theology on fire.

Over time his emphases consolidated rather than shifted. The through-line is consistent: **union with Christ** as the Pauline helm, **kerygma** as the mode of divine address, and **resurrection** as the eschatological hinge of history. His later sermons continue to model **Christocentrism**, pastoral urgency, and an integration of **exegesis** with **doxology**. Stewart’s theology is not a system but a profile etched by recurring categories that cohere in the act of preaching.

#### 9. Legacy and influence
Stewart’s influence is extensive in homiletics and pastoral theology. Generations of preachers cite **Heralds of God** for its summons to bold **kerygma** and for its insistence that the **preached Word** is God’s primary instrument. His scholarly legacy persists in **Pauline studies**, where his case for **union with Christ** as an integrating center anticipated later debates that linked **justification** and **sanctification** under **participation**. His impact on the **New English Bible** ensured that an idiomatic, proclamation-sensitive translation shaped English-speaking churches. While not as architectonic as **Barth** or as controversial as **Bultmann**, Stewart served as a bridge figure, translating **dialectical theology** into the life of the parish and the lecture hall.

Moreover, Stewart helped reposition **Scottish Presbyterianism** within the wider ecumenical conversation by embodying a high **Christology** and a renewed **kerygma** without sacrificing academic rigor. His ministry as **Moderator** in **1963** signaled a public confidence that the gospel still addresses modern society. His legacy endures wherever preaching is conceived as the **Word of God** announcing the **Christ-event** for faith and obedience.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** standpoint, Stewart’s strengths are plain. His **Christocentrism**, his robust **union with Christ**, and his insistence on the **indicative-imperative** structure align with classical **covenant theology** and the **duplex gratia** of **justification and sanctification**. His **kerygmatic** emphasis guards against moralism and grounds the church’s life in **Word and Spirit**, resonating with **sola Scriptura** rightly understood as Scripture’s supremacy in bearing **Christ**. His balanced **eschatology** honors the already and the not yet, and his pastoral homiletic embodies the Reformed conviction that God uses **preaching** as a means of grace.

Concerns arise where **Neo-Orthodox** instincts risk loosening the tether between **Scripture** and dogmatic authority. Stewart’s preference for **Word-event** over a defined doctrine of **verbal plenary inspiration** may invite instability about Scripture’s inerrant reliability. His dialectic of **history and kerygma** can blur the line between events that happened and proclamation that claims them, risking an undercutting of the fully **bodily resurrection** as a public fact. While he retains **substitution** within a representative frame, he does not consistently articulate **penal substitution** as the judicial heart of the **atonement**, a hallmark of classic Reformed orthodoxy. A constructive alternative within the **Reformed** tradition would press a tighter integration of **covenantal revelation** and **inscripturation**, affirming inspiration and inerrancy as the form of God’s sovereign speech; maintain the inseparability of **history and theology** so that the **gospel** is both kerygma and record of divine acts; and articulate **union with Christ** through the duplex benefit of **imputation and impartation**, grounded in Christ’s **federal headship**. Within such parameters, Stewart’s luminous preaching, Pauline center, and Christ-focused exegesis can be gratefully received and critically strengthened.
