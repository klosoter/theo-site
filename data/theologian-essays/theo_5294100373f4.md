### ESSAY
David F. Wells, born in 1939 and long based at **Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary**, has been the most sustained evangelical anatomist of **modernity** and the church since the early 1990s, framing the crisis as the **weightlessness of God** in a culture of **therapeutic, managerial, and consumerist** habits. His project is not the invention of novelty but the recovery of **Reformation conviction** for a late-modern world. Trained in the United Kingdom and North America, with doctoral work in Britain, he absorbed influences from **Peter Berger’s sociology of knowledge**, **Philip Rieff’s analysis of the therapeutic society**, and **Alasdair MacIntyre’s account of moral fragmentation**, while remaining governed by **sola Scriptura** and the **classical Reformed** vision of God. The result is a distinctive blend of **theology of culture** and **dogmatic retrieval**, a method in which descriptive cultural diagnosis is rigorously subordinated to **biblical truth** rather than allowed to norm it. Wells writes as a churchman, an elder of evangelical institutions shaped by the **Lausanne** movement, committed to the publicness of **Christian truth** and the recovery of **pastoral theology** in the face of market pressures.

Wells’s early formation already displayed the two poles that would mark his legacy, a fearless engagement with contemporary currents and a confessional depth grounded in **Reformed orthodoxy**. He first addressed **Roman Catholicism** in **Revolution in Rome** in 1972, reading **Vatican II** through evangelical lenses to ask what was genuinely renewed in **doctrine of salvation** and what remained unchanged in **soteriological structures**. In **The Search for Salvation** in 1978 he widened the horizon to global religious pluralism, assessing modern quests for **redemption** and arguing for the scandal and necessity of **solus Christus**. He returned to fundamentals in **The Person of Christ** in 1984, a concise Christology that defended **homoousios** and the integrity of **two natures** within the unity of the **one person** of the Mediator, offering a template of constructive dogmatics grounded in Scripture and historically alert to **patristic and Reformation** consensus. These works prefigure his later insistence that theology must be public and doctrinally dense against the dissolving acids of **relativism**.

By 1989 Wells’s focus sharpened on the evangelical self. **Turning to God** examined **conversion** in the **Reformed** tradition with **Jonathan Edwards** as chief interlocutor, contrasting Edwards’s God-centered account of the **new birth** and **affections** with **Charles Finney’s** moralistic **revivalism**. Here Wells hallmarks his abiding judgment: evangelicalism loses its theological center when the **sovereign God** and **effectual grace** are displaced by human technique. He argues that recovery requires not a new technology of church growth but a re-immersion in **biblical anthropology** where **sin** is moral guilt before **God’s holiness** rather than maladjustment, and **regeneration** is the Spirit’s monergistic work rather than psychological resolution. This line of thought feeds directly into the critiques he would mount against the **seeker-sensitive** and **therapeutic** paradigms in the 1990s and 2000s, paradigms he saw as baptizing American success culture under thin **biblical** veneers without genuine **doctrinal** ballast.

The turning point came with **No Place for Truth** in 1993, a landmark that diagnosed the disappearance of **theology** from the life of the **church** and the **pastorate** under the pressures of **professionalization**, **pragmatism**, and the university’s post-Christian **plausibility structures**. The narrative of a once-vigorous town and gown divinity culture collapsing into programmatic ministry functions carries a theological claim, namely that when **God’s transcendence** is no longer the organizing reality, the church will inevitably organize around **market niches** and **therapeutic needs**. A year later, **God in the Wasteland** coined Wells’s signature phrase, **the weightlessness of God**, to name the cultural condition in which the biblical God no longer impinges upon consciousness with reality, legality, and grace. Against **immanentist** and **consumerist** habits, Wells calls for the recovery of **divine holiness** and **truth** as the grammar of Christian existence. The suggested remedy is not strategy but **doctrine and doxology**, a re-centering in the nature and acts of the **triune God** who is not reducible to religious experience.

In **Losing Our Virtue** in 1998 Wells broadened his theological-anthropological analysis by drawing on **MacIntyre** and **Rieff** to portray the collapse of a common moral language and the rise of **expressive individualism**. His evangelical target is not the irreligious but the churchly accommodation that translates **sin** into **dysfunction**, **guilt** into **shame management**, and **sanctification** into technique. He argues that biblical **sanctification** presupposes the juridical and moral reality of **divine law**, the forensic depth of **justification**, and the transforming agency of the **Spirit** who conforms believers to **Christ**. Moral discourse that is not tethered to **God’s holiness** and the **cross** cannot form virtues, because virtues require an ordered teleology oriented to **God’s glory**. Wells thus reclaims the Puritan and Edwardsian vision of **affections** reordered by grace, resisting both antinomian and moralistic reductions that map neatly onto the cultural binaries of permissiveness and managerialism.

The cultural sweep of **Above All Earthly Pow'rs** in 2005 brought **postmodernism** explicitly into view, not as a sophisticated philosophy to be refuted but as a diffuse cultural mood that accelerates the fragmentation of **truth**, the optionality of **identity**, and the commodification of **religion**. Wells insists that evangelicalism faces not a single opponent but a confluence of pressures, including **global capitalism**, **media saturation**, and the internal logic of **church marketing**. His critique of the **Emergent** conversation, represented by figures like **Brian McLaren**, is not dismissive of postmodern questions but faulting for abandoning **doctrinal authority** in favor of narrative experimentation. The counter, he argues, is the confession of **Christ’s lordship** over all powers and principalities, a confession that yields a countercultural **ecclesiology** formed by **Word and prayer** and shaped by **Reformation solas**. The book’s title, echoing Luther, signals the Reformation frame he believes uniquely fits the late-modern crisis.

With **The Courage to Be Protestant** in 2008, updated in 2017, Wells distilled decades of analysis into a stark contrast among **truth-lovers**, **marketers**, and **emergents**. His thesis is that evangelicalism must decide whether to be a movement of **biblical truth** or a brand in the **religious marketplace**. He criticizes the metrics that enthrone **numbers** over **faithfulness**, **relevance** over **reverence**, and **experience** over **exegesis**. Yet the work is not merely polemical; it sketches an ecclesial path centered on **expository preaching**, **catechesis**, and the **ordinary means of grace**, rejecting the restless novelty that mistakes **cultural resonance** for **spiritual vitality**. Wells’s use of **Berger’s plausibility structures** here becomes constructive, urging churches to function as counter-publics in which **truth claims** are plausibilized through communal practices of **worship**, **discipleship**, and **mission** under **Christ’s kingship**.

If the 1990s and 2000s were dominated by diagnosis, **God in the Whirlwind** in 2014 pivots to retrieval and synthesis, proposing **holy-love** as the evangelical key to the **doctrine of God**. Wells argues that evangelicalism has long dichotomized **divine holiness** and **divine love**, often absolutizing the latter into sentimentality or the former into severity. He retrieves the classical conviction that the perfections are mutually entailing, so that God’s **love** is holy and God’s **holiness** is loving, a conceptual move in continuity with **classical theism** and **Reformed scholastic** insistence on the simplicity of **divine attributes**. The cross is the decisive theater where **holy-love** is manifest, uniting **propitiation** and **reconciliation** without dissolving either. From this center he sketches the spiritual disciplines and ecclesial practices that allow the **weight of God** to be felt again, especially **preaching** that announces God’s majesty and mercy, **prayer** that reckons with sovereignty, and **mission** that bears witness to truth in a disenchanted world.

Throughout these works Wells’s method exhibits a chastened but confident **epistemic realism**. He rejects both **modern foundationalism** that seeks indubitable certainty and **postmodern constructivism** that renders truth a function of community. Instead he anchors knowledge in **revelation** and the Spirit’s **illumination**, using **sociology** descriptively to trace how **plausibility** is socially mediated. The famous theme of **weightlessness** is not a doctrine but a cultural diagnosis indicating that the living God is no longer the felt horizon of life. His response is doctrinal, insisting that **God’s aseity** and **majesty** must reassert themselves in the church’s self-understanding. He stitches this into pastoral exhortation, urging leaders to resist **professionalization** that suppresses **theologian-pastor** identity and to cultivate countercultural **discipleship**. This is why his prose, even when biting in critique of **megachurch** methods, always returns to **worship** and **truth** as the engine of renewal.

Wells’s interlocutors are carefully chosen. He learns from **Berger** how **secularization** and **pluralization** function, from **Rieff** how a culture of **therapeutic well-being** displaces moral grammar, and from **MacIntyre** how the loss of **teleology** erodes **virtue**. In theology he mines **Calvin** and **Edwards**, and he stands with **B. B. Warfield** and **J. Gresham Machen** in seeing Protestant **orthodoxy** as the necessary backbone of spiritual vitality. He engages **open theism** and wider **process**-leaning proposals implicitly in his defense of **divine sovereignty** and **immutability**, arguing that attempts to secure divine empathy by evacuating classical **perfections** only further the culture’s **immanent frame**. Within evangelical debates his strongest opposition is to **seeker-driven pragmatism** and **Emergent postorthodoxy**, which he reads as twin capitulations to the cultural zeitgeist. Yet he is not nostalgic; his retrieval of **Puritan** and **Reformed** resources is forward-facing, pressing them into the concrete mission of the church amid **global modernities**.

As an evangelical statesman Wells helped articulate the **Cambridge Declaration** in 1996 with the **Alliance of Confessing Evangelicals**, a manifesto calling churches back to **Scripture alone**, **Christ alone**, **grace alone**, **faith alone**, and **glory to God alone**. This document functions as an ecclesial codicil to his books, embodying the conviction that renewal comes through **confessional clarity**. He collaborated with scholars like **John D. Woodbridge** to assess **evangelical identity**, and he taught generations of students to hold together **exegesis**, **systematics**, and **cultural discernment**. Taken together, his corpus is a catechesis in spiritual weight, an effort to make **God’s reality** once again the controlling horizon of evangelical life and thought, to restore gravity where levity reigns. Few evangelical writers have so relentlessly insisted that doctrinal vacuity is not merely a theological problem but a pastoral and missional failure that produces **hollow churches**.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage point the assessment is largely positive yet qualified. Wells’s defense of **sola Scriptura**, **classical theism**, **divine holiness**, and the **Reformation solas** is deeply consonant with **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**, and his insistence that the church be ordered by **Word and sacrament** rather than **market logics** aligns with a **means-of-grace** ecclesiology. His appropriation of **sociology** as ancilla clarifies cultural pressures without norming **revelation**, though a Westminster-style **covenantal apologetics** would press further on the antithesis between **unbelief** and **faith**, warning against any appearance of neutral social science and situating **plausibility structures** more explicitly under the **noetic effects of sin**. Wells’s ecclesial proposals could be thickened by a fuller doctrine of **covenant** and **church** from the **Westminster Standards**, particularly the formative role of the **Lord’s Day**, **catechesis**, and the **supper** alongside preaching in reweighting God before his people. At times his polemics risk overgeneralization about **megachurch** and **emergent** phenomena, and his constructive account might further develop **union with Christ** as the integrative soteriological center. Yet these are refinements more than rebuttals. Wells’s achievement stands as a Reformed exemplar of cultural discernment in service of dogmatic fidelity, calling evangelicals to recover the **gravity of God** in an age of lightness.
