- Historical-theological method that privileges **close reading of Calvin** and early Reformed sources, with an epistemic stance that lets **soteriological union** regulate atonement logic rather than **decretal deduction**.
- Key works: **Union with Christ and the Extent of the Atonement** (2002).
- Central terms: **unio cum Christo**, **extent of the atonement**, **sufficient for all, efficient for the elect**, **hypothetical universalism**, **pactum salutis**, **ordo salutis**, **double-payment argument**.
- Main interlocutors: **John Calvin**, **Theodore Beza**, **John Owen**, **Moise Amyraut**, **John Davenant**, **R. T. Kendall**, **Richard A. Muller**, **Paul Helm**.
- Reformed reception cue: Draws sympathy from classic **hypothetical universalists** and from **Calvin retrieval** projects; challenged by advocates of **definite atonement** in the Owenic line.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Kevin D. Kennedy emerges within a **contemporary Evangelical** setting marked by the aftershocks of **R. T. Kendall's** 1979 thesis on **Calvin and the Calvinists** and the counter-arguments of **Richard A. Muller** and **Paul Helm**. His formation reflects a climate in which the relation between **election**, the **extent of the atonement**, and the priority of **union with Christ** was being reexamined through primary-source work rather than by inherited slogans. From the outset, Kennedy’s method is historically disciplined and conceptually focused: he reads **Calvin's Latin** with an eye to categories like **unio cum Christo**, **pactum salutis**, and **ordo salutis**, asking whether the structure of Calvin’s soteriology is governed more by **Christ himself** than by abstract **decretal logic**. This yields a methodological thesis: one must reason about **atonement extent** from the ground of **Christological and pneumatological union**, not from a bare inference drawn from **predestination**.

Kennedy’s intellectual context is the late twentieth-century retrieval of **Reformation and Post-Reformation** sources and the evangelical impetus to restate **atonement theology** in a way that is both catholic in scope and confessionally accountable. He enters a conversation populated by **John Owen’s** canonical defense of **definite atonement**, **Moise Amyraut’s** nuanced **hypothetical universalism**, **John Davenant’s** diplomatic universal sufficiency and particular efficacy, and **Beza’s** more pronounced **decretal ordering**. Kennedy’s move is neither a simple siding with Amyraut nor an Owenic hard particularism. Rather, his method takes **union with Christ** as the principium of soteriological reasoning, which in turn constrains how one states **sufficiency**, **efficiency**, and the causal sequence of **atonement and application**.

This methodological accent reflects a deeper Evangelical conviction about the epistemic priority of **biblical exegesis** and the canonical pattern of **salvation in Christ**. Kennedy’s deployment of **unio cum Christo** functions not as a vague mysticism but as a classificatory principle by which **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption** are coordinated. On this account, the atonement is materially as broad as the worth of **Christ’s person** and work, but its saving benefits are existentially delimited to those who, by the **Spirit**, are united to **Christ**. Thus, the axis of decision for the **extent of the atonement** is not an abstract decree but the concrete economy of **union and participation**.

#### 2. The major work and its thesis
Kennedy’s principal contribution is his monograph **Union with Christ and the Extent of the Atonement** published in 2002. The book argues that in **Calvin**, the central soteriological category is **unio cum Christo**, and that disputes about **limited atonement** versus **unlimited atonement** misfire unless they are reformulated with union as the controlling frame. Reading passages across **Institutes 3.1–3.3**, **Calvin’s commentaries**, and key sermons, Kennedy contends that **Calvin** did not structure salvation as if **atonement extent** were deduced from **election**; rather, **Calvin** bound the efficacy of the cross to the Spirit’s uniting work, such that the meritorious sufficiency of Christ is truly universal while the saving efficacy is limited to the **elect** by union. In this way, Kennedy leverages **sufficient for all, efficient for the elect** not as an inert scholastic tag but as a dynamic Christological claim anchored in the **communicatio idiomatum** and the infinite dignity of the **homoousios** Son.

A distinctive contribution of the book is its critique of the **double-payment argument** associated with **John Owen’s** 1647 work The Death of Death in the Death of Christ. Kennedy maintains that the **commercial** construal of atonement implied by the double-payment dictum, if taken as a rigid logical necessity, mistakes the instrumentality of **union with Christ** for a mere afterthought. On Kennedy’s reading, there is no actual second payment for the sins of the non-elect because there is no **union** by which the atoning work is imputed or applied to them; the sufficiency of Christ’s death is unbounded, but its legal and life-giving transfer occurs only **in Christ**, that is, within **unio cum Christo**. This avoids positing either a wasted payment or a contradiction in divine justice, precisely by locating **imputation** and **forgiveness** within the sphere of **union** rather than in a transaction abstracted from it.

Kennedy also reads **Beza** and later orthodox developments with care, noting how the ordering of **decrees** and the rise of a robust **pactum salutis** shifted the rhetorical and logical center of gravity in later **Reformed scholasticism**. While not hostile to the **covenant of redemption** as such, he argues that a heavy decretal foregrounding can eclipse **Christological concreteness** and the role of the **Spirit** in uniting the faithful to the Savior. His constructive proposal remains within classical Reformed formulae on **sufficiency and efficiency**, yet it insists that the decisive work of **the Spirit** is dogmatically basic, so that the atonement’s extent cannot be rightly stated without explicit appeal to **union with Christ**.

#### 3. Interlocutors and lines of dispute
Kennedy’s interlocutors are predictable but deeply engaged. He treats **John Owen** as the most substantial exponent of **definite atonement**, granting the pastoral depth of Owen’s **communion with God** spirituality while questioning the logical dominance of the **double-payment argument** in Owen’s polemics. He then revisits **Amyraut’s** **hypothetical universalism**, recognizing its aim to preserve both **universal gospel offer** and **particular election**. Yet he resists any construction that posits a divine will of universal salvation detached from the **Christological** reality of **union**. The alternative he favors is closer to **Davenant**, where the universality of **redemption’s sufficiency** is admitted and even cherished, while the economy of salvation is regulated by **union** as the medium of **efficacy**.

Kennedy recognizes that the late twentieth-century debate was reframed by **R. T. Kendall’s** provocative claim that **Calvin** taught a form of **universal atonement** and that later **Puritans** departed from him. He also credits **Richard Muller** and **Paul Helm** for demonstrating substantial continuity between **Calvin** and the later tradition. Kennedy sides with Muller and Helm in rejecting a sharp **Calvin versus the Calvinists** narrative, yet he presses a nuance: the proportional weight assigned to **unio cum Christo** in **Calvin’s** soteriology is often thinner in later **decretal presentations**, and that shift affects how the **extent of the atonement** is framed. His line is not one of rupture but of recalibration, urging a return to the **Christological and pneumatological** center of the Reformed **ordo salutis**.

Along the way, Kennedy deploys tools from classic dogmatics including **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **inseparable operations**, not in order to flatten the economy into the immanent life of God, but to secure the claim that the cross’s value is grounded in the person of the **incarnate Son**. Thus, the universality of the atonement’s **sufficiency** is a function of the **theandric** subject, while the particularity of **efficacy** tracks the Spirit’s **inseparable operation** of uniting the elect to **Christ**. These categories keep his account from collapsing into a **bare governmental theory** of atonement or into a speculative decree-centered determinism.

#### 4. Exegetical and doctrinal moves
The exegetical backbone of Kennedy’s project is his reading of **Pauline union** texts like **Romans 6**, **Galatians 2.20**, and **Ephesians 1**, along with **Johannine** themes of abiding and participation. He shows that **Calvin’s** exegesis of these loci yields a persistent pattern: all benefits of salvation flow from **union with Christ**, and these benefits, including **justification** and **reconciliation**, are not bestowed apart from union. On this reading, talk of **extent** apart from **union** is a category mistake. The cross achieves everything that is needed for reconciliation in **Christ**, and the **Spirit** applies that achievement by grafting believers into **Christ**, the only sphere in which **pardon**, **righteousness**, and **life** exist.

Doctrinally, Kennedy leans on the twofold grace of **justification and sanctification** in **Calvin**, where both emerge from **unio cum Christo**. He retrieves **sufficient for all, efficient for the elect** as a structured proposition: sufficiency is attributed to the **infinite worth** of the **hypostatic union**, efficiency to the **Spirit’s** uniting action that brings about **faith** and **repentance**. He argues that this formulation honors the **free and sincere offer** of the gospel without implying a frustrated divine purpose, because the divine purpose for the **elect** is precisely to grant **union**, while the universal offer rests on the unbounded value of **Christ’s death**. The pastoral payoff is the assurance that comes from looking to **Christ alone** rather than to introspective signs, echoing **Calvin’s** insistence on Christ as the mirror of election.

Kennedy’s account resists both **universalism** and a brittle **commercialism** by specifying what is meant by **extent**. Extent does not denote a ledger of debts canceled in the abstract; it denotes the scope of the Mediator’s achievement in himself. Only through **unio** does there arise the **forensic** transfer of righteousness and the **vital** participation in Christ’s life. This clarifies why **imputation** is no mere accounting metaphor but a covenantal reality enacted by the **Spirit** in the union that binds believers to the crucified and risen **Lord**.

#### 5. Historical positioning and development
While Kennedy is a contemporary evangelical figure, his project is historiographically aware, locating itself between the expansive intent of **Amyraldian** proposals and the tight definiteness of **Owenic** atonement. He argues that the early **Reformed** tradition was capacious on the formula of **sufficient for all, efficient for the elect**, with figures like **Peter Lombard** and then **Davenant** offering antecedents to a kind of universal sufficiency that does not commit one to **universal salvation**. Kennedy’s contribution is to show how **Calvin’s** union-centric soteriology stabilizes this formula by giving it a concrete **Christological** and **pneumatological** site.

This historical positioning yields a set of developments within evangelical theology. First, it re-centers the atonement debate on **Christology** and **pneumatology**, rather than on naked decree. Second, it upholds the legitimacy of a **universal gospel offer**, not as a pragmatic necessity, but as an inference from the magnitude of **Christ’s merit**. Third, it reframes assurance around **union with Christ**, which in turn relativizes speculative anxieties about one’s decreetal status. Kennedy thus participates in a broader evangelical retrieval of **union with Christ** that includes renewed interest in **Cyril’s** participation language and the Reformed emphasis on the duplex gratia.

Kennedy is not shy about the pastoral implications. He insists that preaching should proclaim a **Christ sufficient for all**, summoning all to **faith**, while promising that all who are **in Christ** truly possess the whole Christ with all his **benefits**. This is neither a bare hypothetical universalism nor a polemical definite atonement rhetoric, but a **union-centered** gospel that draws its lines where the New Testament places them: in **Christ** and by the **Spirit**.

#### 6. Dialogues with modern Evangelical atonement discourse
Kennedy also engages wider Evangelical atonement discourse, where debates between **penal substitution**, **Christus Victor**, and **moral influence** often talk past each other. His emphasis on **unio cum Christo** integrates penal and participatory motifs: in union, believers share in **Christ’s righteousness** and benefit from his **penal substitution**, while participation accounts for transformed life and victory over sin. This union framework ensures that **penal substitution** does not harden into an abstract transaction, nor does **participation** float free of the forensic. By housing both within **union**, Kennedy believes he has retrieved a more fully **Reformed catholic** account consonant with **Calvin** and early **Reformed orthodoxy**.

He also addresses contemporary defenses of **definite atonement**, such as collaborative volumes that reprise **Owen’s** logic with updated exegetical support. Kennedy acknowledges the exegetical strengths of these works but maintains that their best insights are stabilized, not by the **double-payment argument**, but by the **union principle**. This allows one to affirm the **particularity** of redemption without binding God to a metaphysical necessity that risks instrumentalizing **union**. In this way, Kennedy moderates the rhetoric of **definiteness** by embedding it in the economy of **Spirit-wrought union**.

Finally, Kennedy considers the missional horizon. By emphasizing **universal sufficiency** and **particular efficacy**, mission can be conducted with genuine openness, declaring that **Christ** is suitable for every sinner while trusting the **Spirit** to unite the elect. Theologically, this honors the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity and the primacy of **Christ** as the locus of salvation.

#### 7. Systematic upshot and constructive summary
Systematically, Kennedy’s contribution can be summarized by three linked claims. First, the ontological ground of universal **sufficiency** is the **infinite dignity** of the **incarnate Son**, secured by **divine simplicity** and the **hypostatic union**. Second, the soteriological ground of particular **efficacy** is **union with Christ**, secured by the **Spirit’s** efficacious calling and by **faith** as the instrumental means of incorporation into **Christ**. Third, the proper order of reasoning in soteriology runs from **Christology and pneumatology** to **decretal clarity**, not the reverse. These claims together produce a grammar in which **extent** is not a pre- or extra-Christological ledger but a Christologically located description of salvation as it is in **Christ**.

The result is a chastened, classical **Reformed** account reshaped around a central dogmatic locus. By refusing to treat **union** as a derivative addendum, Kennedy retrieves **Calvin’s** pattern in which all **benefits of Christ** flow from **union**. This guards against juridical abstraction on the one hand and against sentimental universalism on the other. It re-situates **atonement debates** inside a more comprehensive account of the **Trinity’s** saving work, distributing agency across the missions of **Son** and **Spirit** while confessing the one will and work of the **Triune God**.

In sum, Kennedy’s thesis is not a novelty but a re-centering. It elaborates the classic formula **sufficient for all, efficient for the elect** by locating both clauses explicitly within **unio cum Christo**, thereby offering Evangelicals a way to speak with maximal breadth about **Christ’s cross** and maximal specificity about **salvation’s application**.

The Reformed and WTS evaluation must register both appreciation and caution. Kennedy’s anchoring of **extent** in **union with Christ** is a salutary retrieval of **Calvin’s** center, reinforcing the **Trinitarian economy**, the **universal offer**, and the duplex gratia. It resists both **Amyraldian** detachment of will from **Christ** and **Owenic** overreliance on the **double-payment** syllogism. Yet from a classical **Reformed/WTS** standpoint one would insist that the decree is not a rival to **Christology** but its antecedent order of divine wisdom, and that the **pactum salutis** secures, rather than endangers, Christological concreteness. The best Reformed alternative preserves Kennedy’s union-centered emphasis while articulating **definite atonement** from election through **covenant** to **union**, avoiding both decretal reductionism and any rhetorical drift toward **indefinite intent**. In principle: revelation governs method, **covenant** orders history, **grace** is sovereign, and **union with Christ** is the Spirit’s climactic application of what the Father purposed and the Son accomplished.
