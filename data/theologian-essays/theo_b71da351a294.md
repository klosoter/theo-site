### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Wendell Berry emerged from the **Bluegrass** of Kentucky as a mid-century heir to the **agrarian** memory of small farms and the accelerating disruption of **industrial agriculture**. Born in 1934 and educated at the **University of Kentucky** and as a **Stegner Fellow** at Stanford in 1958 to 1959, he taught briefly in New York and traveled on a **Guggenheim** to Italy, before returning in 1965 to Lanes Landing to farm and write. This return is the methodological hinge of his theology: knowledge must be accountable to **place**, **neighbors**, and the **created order**. He has described his approach as the **way of ignorance**, not as anti-intellectualism but as creaturely humility before **creation as gift**. The locale of Port Royal and the imagined town of **Port William** supply a concrete anthropology of membership that refuses **individualism** and **statist abstraction** alike. Theologically, Berry is a lay **Baptist** shaped by **Scripture**, rural liturgies of work and Sabbath, and an older **ordo creationis** sensibility about limits, bonds, and stewardship, even as he refuses ideology in favor of practiced **fidelity**.

Berry’s method is resolutely **narrative** and **poetic**, because he believes the created world is richer than any single conceptual grid can hold. He insists that the right scale of concepts must fit the scale of places, and that **truthfulness** requires a sufficiency of words that have not been severed from the realities they name. In this, Berry aligns with an Augustinian discipline of language and a Thomistic trust in **analogia** without adopting a scholastic apparatus; he prefers the lived coherences of a household *oikonomia* practiced with **neighbors**, animals, and soil. To modern managerial rationality and **scientism** he opposes *phronesis*, the habits of judgment by which one learns a field and a community, confessing limits and practicing **Sabbath**. This epistemic humility is sharpened by conflict with reductive accounts of knowledge in **E. O. Wilson’s Consilience**, to which he replies in **Life Is a Miracle** by defending wonder, gratitude, and the irreducibility of **creation**.

#### 2. Major works and the recovery of creation
The charter of Berry’s public argument is **The Unsettling of America** in 1977, a cultural critique of **agribusiness**, dispossession, and the evacuation of **place** that followed postwar mechanization of farms. There he frames a theology of **creation as gift** against the disembedding forces of capital, extracting a common grammar from Genesis, rural practice, and agrarian writers. In **The Gift of Good Land** in 1981 and **What Are People For?** in 1990 he deepens the claim that the land is a good given that commands **gratitude** and **care**. By the time of **Sex, Economy, Freedom & Community** in 1993, he has synthesized his project into a theology of **membership**: the truth about the self is found in belonging to a community of creatures governed by the Creator’s order and by the law of **fidelity**. He explicitly names **Christianity and the Survival of Creation** as a test for churches: whether they will practice the doctrine of **creation** in their economies, habits, and use of land, or collude in **dualism** and **Gnosticism**.

Berry’s essays are complemented by a body of poetry and fiction that perform the same theological convictions. The **Sabbath Poems**, gathered in **This Day** in 2013, enact a weekly attention to the givenness of time, a refusal of **productivism**, and a liturgical consent to limits. His fiction of the **Port William Membership** provides an ecclesiology by analogy: a communion of persons, living and dead, bound by promise, memory, land, and work. Across genres his doctrine of **creation** insists on the bodily goodness of creatures, the moral authority of **limits**, and the primacy of **gratitude** over entitlement.

#### 3. Creatureliness against Gnosticism: body, earth, and sacrament
A persistent polemical target is **Gnosticism**, the modern habit of treating bodies and places as dispensable or raw material for wills. In the essay **The Body and the Earth**, Berry argues that the divorce of human bodies from farms and households produces corruption in both **sex** and **soil**. He presses a robust **incarnational** and **sacramental** imagination without adopting sacramental dogmatics: since the Word became flesh, the created order is not a neutral backdrop but a medium of communion and judgment. Typical is the claim that there are no unsacred places, only **sacred** and **desecrated** places, an axiom that ties praise to the practice of repair. Berry’s sacramental naturalism is tethered to **Genesis 1 to 2**, **Leviticus** on **Sabbath** and **jubilee**, and **Romans 8** on creation’s groaning, but his emphasis is moral rather than metaphysical: our call is to accept creaturely limits as law.

That moral order of **limits** is not an ascetic denial of joy but an *askesis* that serves delight. In the **Sabbath Poems** the cessation of work is obedience to the Creator’s time, a trust that gratuitous life precedes our labor. The created world is to be received, learned, and husbanded in love. Berry refuses technocratic fixations on control and novelty, calling instead for **wisdom**, **patience**, and a renewed grammar of **virtues** such as **fidelity**, **temperance**, and **justice**. Against the restless motion of modern mobility, he commends staying put, learning one place, and letting **love of neighbor** take the form of husbandry.

#### 4. Household economy: scale, tools, and neighbor-love
Berry’s doctrine of **oikonomia** proceeds from the household to the local economy, and from there to the polis, reversing the modern preference for global systems. In **Another Turn of the Crank** and **What Are People For?** he argues that economies should be judged by their fit to **creaturely limits**, their protection of communities, and their capacity for **stewardship**. He borrows from and converges with **E. F. Schumacher** on human scale, **Ivan Illich** on **convivial tools**, and **Aldo Leopold** on **land health**, while testing every abstract principle by whether it preserves **neighbors** and **soil**. The small farm, the local trades, and the craft of husbandry embody a politics of **subsidiarity** in which responsibility and knowledge are close to the consequences of action.

Berry’s agrarian ethics are not nostalgia. They are a program of **appropriate technology**, competent workmanship, and honest accounting of costs in energy, soil, and community. He names **industrial agriculture** sinful insofar as it lies about its debts, externalizes ruin, and destroys living **members** of the land community. In dialogue with **Wes Jackson** and The Land Institute, he has imagined perennial polycultures and agricultural design that mimic prairies. The point, however, is always moral and theological: receive **creation as gift**, work within the created **order of limits**, and so at once honor **God** and your **neighbor**.

#### 5. Sex, marriage, and the ecology of fidelity
Berry’s notorious triad in **Sex, Economy, Freedom & Community** treats **eros**, work, and liberty as one ecology. He claims that freedom without **belonging** dissolves into license, and that sexual relations cannot be truthful where they are disembedded from **household economy** and **place**. In **Poetry and Marriage** he treats marriage as a craft that disciplines desire into **fidelity**, a covenant whose bonds sustain and are sustained by common work. The critique of commodified sexuality parallels the critique of commodified land: what cannot be priced must be protected by **promise** and **custom**.

Fictional portraits like **Hannah Coulter** and **Jayber Crow** give this theology flesh. Widowhood, betrayal, and the persistence of **mercy** are set against the losses of war and the displacements of modern schooling. The burden and gift of **children**, the natural ties of kin and neighbor, and the interplay of eros and agape are calibrated to a place where memory governs identity. Theologically, Berry’s sexual ethics stand against **dualism** and for the **unity of body and spirit**, insisting that **covenant fidelity** is the human form of gratitude for **creation**.

#### 6. Language, truth, and public life
In **Standing by Words** Berry develops a theology of language as an ecology of **truthfulness**. Words, like tools, must be fit to their work and accountable to realities they name. Advertising, political euphemism, and technocratic jargon are judged because they break **covenant** with neighbors and land by rendering harms invisible. In **Citizen­ship Papers** and essays like **Thoughts in the Presence of Fear** he connects the weakness of public speech after 9/11 to the **brittleness** of an economy that depends on distant systems and concentrated power. Truthful words train perception to see **neighbors**, **creatures**, and debts; false words license exploitation and **violence**.

Berry’s moral theology thereby extends to **peacemaking** and **justice**. He opposes wars that are the fruit of an extractive economy and a political impatience with limits. He insists that **law** be measured by its service to local communities and real lands. The **Sabbath** again anchors his critique: a polity that cannot rest or tell the truth is a polity that will not keep its promises. His plea is not for program but for practices of **accountability** in speech, work, and worship, so that common life becomes a school of **virtue** under the Creator’s law.

#### 7. Race, history, and repair
Berry’s attention to the American wound of race is early and sustained, from **The Hidden Wound** in 1970 to **The Need to Be Whole** in 2022. He argues that **slavery** and the long history of exploitation deformed both the land and the moral life of white and black communities, leaving a nearly congenital incapacity for **neighbor-love**. The hidden wound is a wound to membership, a betrayal of **communion** at the heart of American place. Importantly, Berry refuses an easy rhetoric of innocence; the call is to **repair** through restitution, shared work, and reconstitution of communities ordered to **land health** and **justice**.

Here Berry’s ecclesial reticence is more visible. He appeals to the **Gospel** to condemn the exploitation of bodies and places, but the agents of healing he names are practitioners of **husbandry**, teachers, families, and local institutions rather than the **church** as such. Still, he names **sin** clearly as avaritia and superbia, the lust to convert gifts into capital and neighbors into means. Repair, then, is not only policy but **repentance**, a long obedience in the same place that makes historical wrongs visible and survivable in a renewed **membership**.

#### 8. Eschatology, communion, and hope
Berry’s most suggestive theological claims come through the **Port William** cycle, where the **Membership** includes the living and the dead. In **A Place on Earth**, **The Memory of Old Jack**, **Jayber Crow**, and **Hannah Coulter**, a thick sense of time binds persons across generations, transfiguring loss with gratitude. The line to which readers return, from the **Mad Farmer** poems, is the imperative to **practice resurrection**. This is not a vague trope: it is a rule for living by the *telos* of **resurrection of the body**, doing present work in the light of promised restoration. The practice takes form as Sabbath-keeping, neighbor service, husbandry, small joys, and the refusal of despair.

The communion Berry describes analogically parallels the **communion of saints**. It is not an ecclesiology; nevertheless, the liturgies of work and harvest, table and field, become signs of **grace** and **thanksgiving**. He is cautious of triumphalism and of modern apocalyptic that excuses present waste in the name of a better future. The earth is to be kept, not used up. Eschatology must be an invitation to **fidelity** in place rather than a license for progress or despair. In his universe, creation’s groaning and the saints’ perseverance through **suffering** resolve in a hope that is quiet, homely, and costly.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage, Berry’s strengths are luminous. He recovers the **doctrine of creation** as normative order, insists on **Sabbath** as time sanctified, honors **vocation** as service to neighbor and place, and rebukes **Gnosticism** that denies the goodness of bodies and land. His household **oikonomia** resonates with **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, and his defense of truthful speech coheres with a **lex veritatis** that binds words to reality. His critique of **scientism** and managerial modernity aligns with a **Van Tilian** wariness of autonomous reason, while his affirmation of common life expresses **common grace** working through ordinary arts. Yet several tensions call for Reformed reordering. First, his epistemic and moral reliance on *creation* sometimes eclipses **special revelation**. A Reformed account would center **covenant theology**, where the **covenant of creation** and the **covenant of grace** together interpret place, work, and limits under the Lordship of Christ. Second, Berry’s analogical ecclesiology of **membership** is salutary but insufficient; the **church**, with Word and **sacraments** as means of grace, is the divinely appointed community to form stewards and peacemakers. Third, Berry’s eschatology risks a realized homecoming that can understate the antithesis and the **noetic effects of sin**; Reformed teaching insists that genuine agrarian prudence requires regeneration and catechesis oriented to the **heavenly city** and the consummation of the new creation. The best Reformed reception, therefore, would gratefully adopt Berry’s **agrarian prudence**, **Sabbath discipline**, and **household economy**, while explicitly situating them within the **history of redemption**, governed by **Scripture**, and led by the **church’s** covenantal worship toward the promised **resurrection** and restored creation.
