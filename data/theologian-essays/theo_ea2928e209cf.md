### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to relational theism
John Sanders emerges as a leading voice of contemporary **evangelical** revision of the **doctrine of God**, arguing that Scripture’s central portrayal is of a relational Lord whose governance involves genuine **risk providence**. His intellectual formation occurs amid the late twentieth-century American debates over **inerrancy**, **providence**, and the problem of **evil**, with teaching appointments at **Huntington College** and later **Hendrix College** and public controversy in the **Evangelical Theological Society** between 2002 and 2003. Theologically, Sanders stands within a **Wesleyan–Arminian** stream that prizes **libertarian freedom** and universal salvific **love**, yet he adapts these commitments into the bolder claims of **open theism**. The pastoral impetus is clear: if God truly loves, then divine governance must be compatible with authentic human responsiveness, significant **petitionary prayer**, and the raw drama of lament and trust. Against an allegedly **Hellenized classical theism**, he contends that the canonical narrative from **Genesis** to **Revelation** depicts a **temporal God** who responds, regrets, and rejoices without loss of sovereign faithfulness.

#### 2. Method: narrative exegesis, philosophical clarity, and embodiment
Sanders’ method integrates **biblical-theological narrative**, **analytic-philosophical argument**, and later **cognitive linguistics**. From **Abraham J. Heschel**’s account of **divine pathos** and **Terence Fretheim**’s reading of the **Old Testament God of relationship**, he draws a hermeneutic that privileges the plain sense of the text’s divine emotions and decisions. Philosophically, he rejects **timeless eternity** in favor of **everlasting temporality**, denies **exhaustive definite foreknowledge** of indeterminate free acts, and defends **libertarian creaturely freedom** as a necessary condition of love. In **Theology in the Flesh** 2016, Sanders appropriates **Lakoff and Johnson** to argue that theological reason is irreducibly shaped by **conceptual metaphors** such as God-as-king or God-as-parent. This cognitive turn grounds a **fallibilist** and **anti-foundationalist** epistemic humility, while maintaining confidence that canonical metaphors constrain and direct doctrine. The methodological aim is not relativism but a chastened **theological realism** that honors embodiment, culture, and Scripture’s own metaphoric repertoire in constructing a doctrine of **providence** and **omniscience**.

#### 3. Soteriological beginnings: No Other Name and the wider hope
Before the openness manifesto, Sanders’ **No Other Name** 1992 tackled the destiny of the **unevangelized** through a defense of **evangelical inclusivism**. He charted three families of views: **restrictivism** associated with **Ronald Nash**, **postmortem evangelization** defended by **Gabriel Fackre**, and **inclusivism** as Sanders’ own position. He affirmed **Christ’s unique mediation** and **creatio ex nihilo**, rejected **religious pluralism**, yet argued that **general revelation** and the universally present **Spirit** can elicit a faith-response to God that is savingly related to **Christ** without explicit knowledge of the name. In the edited volume **What About Those Who Have Never Heard?** 1995, he staged and defended this **wider-hope** proposal within an evangelical canon. Scriptural warrant is taken from **Romans 1–2**, **Acts 10**, and the broader biblical portrait of a God whose **providence** is generous, whose **grace** seeks all, and whose **judgment** is according to light received. This early soteriological work already displays Sanders’ twin instincts: a **relational theodicy** that vindicates divine love and a **method** that integrates exegesis with philosophical clarity about providential order.

#### 4. The openness project: coalition and core theses
With **The Openness of God** 1994, co-authored with **Clark Pinnock**, **Richard Rice**, **William Hasker**, and **David Basinger**, Sanders helped consolidate **open theism** as a family of theses about **God**, **freedom**, and the **future**. The core claims are programmatic. First, **dynamic omniscience**: God knows all reality as it is, so the future that includes undetermined free acts is known by God as a realm of genuine possibilities rather than fixed truths. Second, **relational mutability**: God is unchangingly faithful in character, yet responsive in will and action within history. Third, **risk providence**: divine governance is not meticulous determinism but sovereign, wise guidance of a world that includes libertarian agents and recalcitrant powers. Sanders distances open theism from **process theology**, insisting on **divine freedom**, **aseity**, and unilateral **power** to act, while denying a metaphysical co-dependence between God and world. He also opposes **Molinism** associated with **Thomas Flint**, arguing that **middle knowledge** of counterfactuals of libertarian freedom smuggles in determinism or rests on dubious truthmakers. The openness coalition thus positions itself between **Calvinist compatibilism** and **Molinist scientia media**, advocating a **temporally interactive** Lord.

#### 5. The God Who Risks: providence reimagined through Scripture
Sanders’ signature contribution is **The God Who Risks** 1998, revised 2007, a full-scale doctrine of **providence** argued from canonical narrative and philosophical analysis. He reads **Genesis 6**, **Exodus 32**, **1 Samuel 15**, **Jeremiah 18**, **Jonah 3**, and many **prophetic** texts as disclosing a God who sometimes regrets prior actions, revises announced intentions, and issues **conditional prophecy** ordered to creaturely repentance. The cruciform center is pronounced: at the cross God embraces maximal **vulnerability** for the sake of covenantal communion, demonstrating that divine glory is the power of **self-giving love** rather than unilateral control. On this account, **petitionary prayer** makes an authentic difference because God has chosen to include creaturely input within the unfolding of history. Regarding evil, Sanders advances a **relational theodicy**: gratuitous horrors are not folded into a meticulous blueprint but resisted by God who skillfully redeems by **improvisation** within the constraints created by **libertarian freedom**. God’s sovereignty is **general** and purposive, not micro-determining; providence is a wise governance of possibilities rather than a decree of particulars.

#### 6. Omniscience, time, and the open future: philosophical scaffolding
The philosophical scaffolding of Sanders’ **dynamic omniscience** turns on the status of **future contingents**. He adopts a version of **presentism** in the metaphysics of time and contends that propositions about undetermined free acts lack settled truth-values to be known. Hence denying **exhaustive definite foreknowledge** is not a limitation on God but an affirmation that God knows reality as it is: the settled past and present exhaustively and the open future as a structured field of possibilities. He engages **William Hasker** on the logic of foreknowledge and freedom, rejects **Ockhamist** strategies as insufficient, and charges **Molinism** with positing ungrounded counterfactuals. Divine **providence** is therefore described with **probabilistic** categories and **resourceful omniscience** whereby God anticipates multiple branches and secures ultimate purposes without predetermining each event. Against **Calvinist compatibilism**, he argues that moral responsibility and love require the power of **alternative possibilities**. The cost is granted: God assumes **risk** that some goods will be lost or delayed. The gain, Sanders insists, is a theology that secures real **intercession**, genuine **mission**, and an account of **evil** that does not implicate God as the author of sin.

#### 7. Controversy and reception: evangelical identity under strain
The reception of Sanders’ **open theism** has been polarizing within the **evangelical** world. In 2002–2003 the **Evangelical Theological Society** considered motions to remove **Clark Pinnock** and **John Sanders** for views alleged to conflict with **inerrancy** and traditional accounts of **foreknowledge**; the society ultimately did not expel them, though the episode exposed fault lines about evangelical identity. His tenure denial at **Huntington College** in 2003 reinforced the sense that openness proposals pressed institutional boundaries. Critics such as **Bruce Ware** in **God’s Lesser Glory** 2000, **Paul Helm** in works on **eternity** and **providence**, and **John Frame** in **The Doctrine of God** 2002 charged that open theism compromises **sovereignty**, undermines **trust** in **prophecy**, and dissolves **divine immutability** and **impassibility** into historicized flux. Sanders has replied that his model preserves robust **omnipotence**, grounds **prayer** and **mission**, and more faithfully tracks the **biblical narrative** of God who grieves, relents, and rejoices. The debate sharpened evangelical reflection on **providence**, pushing interlocutors to clarify **compatibilism**, **Molinism**, and **simple-foreknowledge** options.

#### 8. Dialogue with tradition: Does God Have a Future? and patristic exchange
In **Does God Have a Future?** 2003, Sanders engages **Christopher A. Hall** in an extended dialogue that juxtaposes **patristic theism** with **openness** claims. Hall presses **divine simplicity**, **timelessness**, and **impassibility**, retrieving **Athanasius** and **Augustine** to argue that God’s **aseity** requires nonpassionate stability *ad intra* with freely willed affections *ad extra*. Sanders counters that such classical metaphysics, often filtered through **Neoplatonism**, cannot accommodate Scripture’s vibrant story of divine interaction. He grants a stable **divine character**, but insists that covenantal **love** entails responsive **agency** that includes change in relational states. The exchange reveals Sanders’ willingness to learn from tradition while maintaining that **canonical exegesis** must regulate metaphysical commitments. He urges that **Trinitarian** doctrine be rearticulated in terms of **relational ontology**, not substance metaphysics, so that **providence** means the triune God’s wise, temporal engagement aiming at communion rather than control. The volume functions as an accessible window into how **open theism** positions itself over against **patristic** and **Reformed** retrievals.

#### 9. Theology in the Flesh: cognition, metaphor, and doctrinal humility
Sanders’ mature methodological work, **Theology in the Flesh** 2016, pivots to **cognitive science** to account for how embodied agents reason theologically. Drawing on **Lakoff and Johnson**, he argues that conceptual **metaphors** structure doctrines of **God**, **morality**, and **truth**. Certain metaphoric frames like **ruler**, **parent**, **shepherd**, or **lover** highlight and hide features that then crystallize into metaphysical claims about **immutability**, **impassibility**, or **passibility**. The upshot is an appeal for **epistemic humility** and plural **modeling** within orthodoxy, though Sanders still contends that Scripture’s dominant metaphors press toward **relational mutability** and **dynamic omniscience**. This work also reframes debates about **providence** and **evil**: rather than choosing between **meticulous sovereignty** and **deistic distance**, embodied cognition helps theologians appreciate why communities gravitate to different construals and how to test them by **canonical coherence**, **pastoral fruitfulness**, and **mission**. Sanders thus broadens his project from defending **open theism** to cultivating a practice of **doctrinal construction** attentive to language, culture, and the human condition under God.

#### 10. Doctrinal synthesis: providence, prayer, mission, and love
Across his corpus, Sanders weaves a coherent doctrinal tapestry: God is **triune love** whose **providence** takes the form of **wise risk**, not ironclad control; **omniscience** means knowing all there is to know, including possibilities that are genuinely open; **omnipotence** is sovereign power exercised in accord with covenantal **love** that refuses coercion of **libertarian agents**; **prayer** and **prophecy** are interactive means by which God partners with creatures; **evil** arises from created and angelic misuse of freedom, with God skillfully redeeming rather than scripting horrors; and **mission** extends a **wider hope** through **inclusivism** rooted in **Christ** and the **Spirit**. He distinguishes his view from **process theism** by affirming **creatio ex nihilo** and divine ability to act unilaterally, yet he refuses **metaphysical immutability** that would, in his judgment, empty divine affections of authenticity. The tone is consistently pastoral and missional, seeking to reconcile anguished believers to a God who suffers with them and invites authentic cooperation in the unfolding of history. In this sense, **The God Who Risks** and **No Other Name** are two halves of one evangelical project: a God of cruciform **love** whose **providence** is open to, and enriched by, creaturely response.

In a Reformed and Westminster evaluation, Sanders’ **open theism** offers a salutary protest against depersonalized **deism** and a needed emphasis on **covenantal relationality**, **prayer**, and the canon’s depiction of divine **affections**. Yet its denials of **exhaustive definite foreknowledge**, **divine immutability**, **simplicity**, and **impassibility** generate deep tensions with **classical Reformed orthodoxy**. Scripture’s anthropomorphic idiom is better located within an **analogy-of-being** account in which God is immutable and impassible *ad intra* while truly responsive *ad extra* through freely willed affections that do not entail ontological change. **Compatibilist freedom** preserves moral responsibility without positing indeterminate future contingents, thereby sustaining **providence** as a comprehensive decree that upholds real means, including **prayer** as ordained instrument. On **evil**, the Reformed distinction between **decretive** and **preceptive** will, alongside the **cross** as the archetype of God’s wise ordination of sinless suffering for redemptive ends, avoids implicating God as author of sin while securing assurance that no horror falls outside His providence. Regarding **inclusivism**, the Reformed tradition insists on the **ordinary means of grace** and the necessity of explicit **gospel** faith, while allowing God’s freedom to save extraordinarily without making such exceptions a rule of **mission**. The alternative offered is **covenantal classical theism**: **aseity**, **simplicity**, and **immutability** held with robust **personalism**, so the triune Lord is both the living God of **Abraham** and the sovereign King who declares the end from the beginning.
