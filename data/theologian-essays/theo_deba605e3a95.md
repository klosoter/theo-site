### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The ministry of **Andrew A. Bonar** 1810–1892 unfolded within the charged atmosphere of **nineteenth-century Scottish Evangelicalism**, shaped decisively by the **Disruption of 1843** and the founding of the **Free Church of Scotland** under **Thomas Chalmers**. Born in Edinburgh on 29 October 1810, educated at the **University of Edinburgh**, and ordained to **Collace** in 1838 before later translating to **Finnieston Free Church, Glasgow** in 1856, Bonar navigated the contested terrain between **Moderate** and **Evangelical** parties by articulating a robust **Reformed orthodoxy** that was at once doctrinally exact and warmly devotional. His intellectual posture exemplified **experiential Calvinism**: a theology of **sola Scriptura** exegesis, *unio cum Christo*, and daily holiness, recorded with unusual transparency in his **Diary and Letters** 1893. Theologically, he combined the classic **Westminster** catechetical framework with a pastoral method of **Christocentric typology**, reading the **Old Testament** cultus as a textured testimony to the **person and work of Christ**. This approach, already evident in his early sermons and confirmed in his later published works, formed both his homiletic backbone and his distinctive contribution to **Reformed biblical theology** before the formalization of that discipline under figures like **Geerhardus Vos**.

As part of the Evangelical leadership who left the established church in 1843 on questions of **spiritual independence** and **patronage**, **Andrew Bonar** developed a churchmanship that bound **doctrine** to **discipline**, and **revival** to the **ordinary means of grace**. His pastoral practice, captured in his **diaries** and parish records, was a liturgy of Scripture, prayer, catechesis, and sacramental fidelity. The key theological accents of his ministry—**penal substitution**, **priestly mediation**, **holiness**, and **assurance**—were not academic abstractions but living realities he pressed on consciences with a discerning **casuistry** inherited from older Scottish divines. In method he conspicuously refused the rationalist reduction of **typology** to mere literary motif, insisting it was covenantally given, Christologically anchored, and doxologically fruitful.

#### 2. Companions, missions, and the making of a pastoral theologian
The early friendship between **Andrew Bonar** and **Robert Murray M’Cheyne** profoundly shaped both men. Their joint participation in the **Church of Scotland Mission of Inquiry to the Jews** in 1839, alongside **Alexander Keith** and **John Duncan**, culminated in the **Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the Jews** 1842. That narrative is more than travelogue; it is a theological document arguing for the **restoration of the Jews** within a **covenantal** and eschatological horizon and marshaling biblical promises as warrant for mission strategy. The mission fused a deep reading of **Romans 9–11** with practical arrangements for evangelization, and it catalyzed Jewish mission initiatives in the **Free Church** after the **Disruption**. Here we see Bonar’s characteristic synthesis: **exegesis** tethered to **pastoral action**, **eschatology** energizing **evangelism**, and **Reformed confessionalism** animating cross-cultural work.

The death of **M’Cheyne** in 1843 precipitated Bonar’s most famous book, the **Memoir and Remains of Robert Murray M’Cheyne** 1844, which intentionally wove biography, sermons, letters, and diary extracts into a model of **holy ministry**. The Memoir did not simply canonize its subject; it showcased Bonar’s **theological psychology** of grace. In categories reminiscent of **Jonathan Edwards** on the **religious affections**, the Memoir commends a sanctified sensibility: Christ-ward love, mortification of sin, Sabbath holiness, and faithful adherence to the **means of grace**. Though often remembered as hagiography, the work is doctrinally serious, articulating **law and gospel** through narrativized casuistry and normalizing a rhythm of self-examination, repentance, and assurance. It stands as a pastoral theology in narrative form, shaping piety far beyond Scotland through the famous **M’Cheyne Bible reading plan** preserved and promoted by Bonar.

#### 3. Leviticus and the grammar of holiness
If the **Memoir** illustrates **holiness**, then **A Commentary on Leviticus: Expository and Practical** 1846 articulates its **grammar**. Bonar’s Leviticus is a classic of **Christ-centered typology**, not as free-floating allegory but as covenant-anchored exegesis. The sacrificial system, priesthood, and purity laws are all read under the canopy of **Christ’s priestly office** and **penal substitution**, making the Mosaic cultus a Spirit-given pedagogy that trains the church in the logic of **atonement**. Bonar returns repeatedly to the motto of the high priest, **Holiness to the Lord**, as the scriptural leitmotif of both **redemption** and **sanctification**. He carefully distinguishes the once-for-all efficacy of **Christ’s sacrifice** from the daily call to mortification and consecration, thereby holding **justification** and **sanctification** together within the *ordo salutis* without conflation.

Bonar’s expositions defend the **moral law’s** abiding authority and the **ceremonial law’s** enduring testimony. He stresses that the ceremonial types are fulfilled in **Christ** and thus no longer bind the conscience as institutions, yet they continue to catechize the church in the holiness of God and the costliness of forgiveness. The commentary, warmly commended by **C. H. Spurgeon**, shows a steady theological hand: **divine simplicity** safeguards the unity of God’s holiness and love; **immutability** secures covenant reliability; and the **covenant of grace** frames the whole sacrificial economy, preventing both antinomian evasion and legalistic distortion. Even where Bonar ventures beyond the tame exegesis of his day, his typological moves are bounded by confessional Christology and the **Westminster Standards**.

#### 4. Sanctification, assurance, and pastoral casuistry
Across sermons, letters, and the **Diary and Letters** 1893, **Andrew Bonar** develops a program of sanctification that is simultaneously **union-centric** and **means-centric**. The believer’s *unio cum Christo* is the fountain of both definitive sanctification and progressive holiness, and the **means of grace**—Word, sacrament, prayer—are the ordained channels by which the Spirit conforms believers to **Christ**. Bonar’s casuistry rejects **perfectionism** and **quietism** alike, arguing that holiness is neither an eradication of sin nor a passive waiting for spiritual crisis, but a Spirit-enabled, mortifying and vivifying pilgrimage under the banner of **adoption**. He insists on a pastoral sequencing: **law** convicts, **gospel** consoles, **Spirit** strengthens, **church** disciplines, and **hope** sustains.

This pastoral theology is rigorously ecclesial. Bonar upheld **fencing the table**, **discipline**, and catechetical formation, while maintaining the tenderness of **gospel invitation**. Assurance is treated as the fruit of **faith in Christ** rather than the product of introspective temperature-taking, though he prizes self-examination as a wise **Puritan** practice. Notably, Bonar’s emphasis on **secret prayer**, congregational **prayer meetings**, and frequent exposition of the **Psalms** discloses a spirituality that is both intensely Godward and covenantally communal. The trajectory of his counsel aims at worshipers who know the *lex orandi, lex credendi*: prayer shapes creed, and creed purifies prayer.

#### 5. Revival, ordinary means, and the question of measures
Though reverent of the **ordinary means of grace**, **Andrew Bonar** was an unembarrassed advocate for **revival**. He chronicled and supported seasons of awakening in the 1830s and 1840s, and later welcomed the 1859 awakenings and the 1873–1874 **Moody and Sankey** missions in Scotland. His judgments are discriminating. He rejected **manipulative measures** and any **decisionism** that short-circuited repentance and church membership, but he welcomed extraordinary seasons of **Spirit-wrought conviction** that magnified **Christ’s cross** and increased sacramental fidelity. To justify this posture, he drew on **Edwardsian** criteria for distinguishing genuine from spurious experiences and appealed to historic Reformed testimony about unusual outpourings of the **Spirit**.

Bonar’s revival doctrine remained ecclesial, not parachurch. He insisted that awakenings must be interpreted and stewarded by pastors, anchored to **preaching**, **catechesis**, and **discipline**. His own prayer life, recorded in the **Diary**, models the posture he urged on others: a life **ad fontes** in Scripture, unhurried intercession, and persistent pleading for **God’s presence** in the stated worship of the church. In this, Bonar offered a corrective to both revivalist pragmatism and formalistic complacency, calling the church to desire more from the **God of the covenant** without abandoning the **covenant means**.

#### 6. Israel, eschatology, and millenarian hopes
In the wake of the 1839 mission and the exegesis of **Romans 11**, **Andrew Bonar** maintained a lifelong expectation of the **restoration of the Jews** and tended toward **premillennial** hope regarding the **second advent**. This chiliastic hue did not displace his **Westminster** orthodoxy, but it oriented his reading of prophecy and energized missionary zeal. He distinguished sharply between speculative date-setting and pastoral readiness, distancing himself from the excesses of prophetic sensationalism while still reading the times with biblically shaped anticipation. For Bonar, the promises to **Abraham** and the unsearchable mercy of God toward **Israel** lent a note of eschatological expectancy that avoided **supersessionist** flattening and guarded against a purely spiritualized ecclesiology.

His eschatological stance sharpened, rather than diluted, his commitments to **penal substitution**, **resurrection**, and the **visible church**. The decisive acts of God in history, climaxing in **Christ’s return**, grounded his exhortations to holiness and mission. In a theological environment increasingly affected by **liberal historicism** and skeptical **biblical criticism**, Bonar’s posture asserted the reliability of prophecy as covenant speech. The **Levitical** patterns that fulfilled in **Christ** assured him that the **eschatological** patterns would likewise issue in visible divine fidelity.

#### 7. Literary ministry and networks of influence
Beyond his signature books, **Andrew Bonar** penned the **Life of John Milne of Perth** 1869, a pastoral portrait that reinforced his ecclesial and missionary priorities and offered models of **evangelistic preaching** and churchmanship within the **Free Church**. His correspondence with figures like **John Duncan** and his collaborations within the Scottish Evangelical network amplified his influence, while his brother **Horatius Bonar** supplied poetic and hymnic complements to Andrew’s expository labors. Through **Spurgeon’s** endorsements, many in the English-speaking world encountered Bonar’s **Leviticus**, securing for it a place among nineteenth-century evangelical commentaries that married **doctrine** to **devotion**.

Posthumously, the **Diary and Letters** 1893 cemented his reputation as a pastor of rare tenderness and resilience. These pages are not mystical speculation but disciplined attention to **Scripture**, the **means of grace**, and the pastoral burdens of a large urban charge in **Glasgow**. They also display his careful accounting of providences, his anxieties over the church’s holiness, and his measured appreciation for transatlantic evangelicalism, including the labors of **Moody and Sankey**. Through these texts, Bonar’s voice became catechetical for ministers learning to hold **doctrinal firmness** and **pastoral softness** together.

#### 8. Doctrinal profile in Reformed key
Theologically, **Andrew Bonar** is best understood as a nineteenth-century exponent of classic **Reformed orthodoxy** refracted through a pastoral lens. On **Scripture**, he maintained a robust **inerrantist** instinct before the term was standardized, defending the unity of **Old** and **New Testaments** and treating **typology** as covenantally grounded rather than aesthetic. On **God**, he presupposed **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity**, treating these perfections as safeguards for pastoral comfort, especially in the assurance of **covenant mercy**. On **Christ**, he upheld the **communicatio idiomatum** and the **munus triplex** with a specific accent on the **priestly office**, since his preaching habitually returned to **sacrifice**, **intercession**, and **access**. On **atonement**, he was unequivocally **penal substitutionary**, drawing argument from **Leviticus**, **Isaiah 53**, and **Hebrews**, resisting both moral exemplar reductions and governmental theories.

One of his distinctive contributions lay in weaving **sanctification** into the warp of sacrificial imagery. Holiness is participation in the sanctity of the **priest-king**, grounded in definitive deliverance and animated by the Spirit’s indwelling presence. Bonar’s *ordo salutis* never became a mechanical sequence; rather, it functioned as a pastoral map, directing souls to **Christ** and back to the **means of grace**. Ecclesiologically, he was a **Presbyterian** of settled convictions, harmonizing **discipline** and **gospel promise**, sustaining **Sabbath** observance, and guarding the **Lord’s Supper** as the church’s holy feast where **faith** feeds on **Christ** by the **Spirit**. Even his **eschatology**, distinctively **premillennial** for a Presbyterian minister of his era, was harnessed for evangelistic prayer and Jewish mission rather than for sectarian speculation.

#### 9. Influence, limitations, and Reformed/WTS evaluation
The legacy of **Andrew Bonar** persists in several registers: the formation of pastors through the **Memoir of M’Cheyne**, the nourishing of lay piety through the **Leviticus** commentary, and the shaping of missionary consciousness regarding **Israel** through the **Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry**. He served as a bridge between classic **Puritan** divinity and modern evangelical ministry, keeping together what later movements often separated: **holiness** and **happiness** in God, **revival** and **ordinary means**, **doctrine** and **devotion**. His readability never compromised confessional depth; his tenderness never softened moral urgency.

From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, the assessment is appreciative yet discriminating. Positively, Bonar’s **Christocentric typology** honors the **unity of Scripture**, his **penal substitution** aligns with the **Westminster Standards**, and his commitment to the **means of grace** corrects revivalist voluntarism. His pastoral casuistry exemplifies a biblically wise handling of **law and gospel**, and his reverent use of **ceremonial types** offers a model for preaching **Christ** from the **Old Testament** without collapsing into free allegory. Cautions emerge at three points. First, his **premillennial** and **restorationist** expectations, though restrained, create tension with classical **amillennial** readings common in confessional Presbyterianism and risk reifying a two-track **church and Israel** schema in ways that the **covenant of grace** resists. Second, his embrace of **revival** requires careful tethering to **Word and sacrament**, lest extraordinary seasons overshadow the ordinary, pastoral **economy of grace**. Third, a strand of introspective **pietism** in the **Memoir** and **Diary** can be overread by later audiences, potentially displacing objective **gospel indicatives** with subjective fluctuation of the **affections**; Bonar himself balances this, but imitators may not. The alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is not a different gospel but a clarified accent: redemptive-historical preaching that grounds **sanctification** in **union with Christ** and situates **hope** in the already-not yet of the **kingdom**, while receiving Bonar’s own best insights on prayer, holiness, and sacrificial grace.
