### ESSAY
Glen Clary emerges as a contemporary voice in the **Reformed tradition** who orients the entire question of worship around the **ascension and session of Christ** and the church’s **covenantal pilgrimage to heavenly Mount Zion**. As a minister in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, he works within the gravitational field of the **Westminster Standards** while participating in the wider movement of **retrieval theology** that seeks the wisdom of **patristic antiquity** and **Reformed scholastic** precision alike. His publications and lectures, especially through **Reformed Forum** and in **OPC** outlets such as **Ordained Servant** and **New Horizons**, model a pedagogy that is exegetically thick and historically aware. The central thesis that binds Clary’s teaching is that **Reformed worship** is fundamentally an act of **covenantal communion** with the enthroned Christ, made possible by the **Spirit**, regulated by **Scripture**, and structured by the **means of grace**, so that the earthly assembly participates in the **heavenly liturgy** described in **Hebrews** and **Revelation**.

Clary’s method is confessedly **biblical-theological** in a **Vosian** key. The idiom of **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis**, the already and the not yet, and the climactic **Sabbath eschatology** all serve his account of the **Lord’s Day** as an **eschatological sign** of the world to come. Here he follows **Geerhardus Vos** on the Sabbath as an eschatological pledge and **Meredith G. Kline** on the **mountain of God** and **covenantal assembly**, pressing these themes into a **liturgical theology** of the church’s gathered service. This a fortiori hermeneutic reads **Hebrews 12** and **Revelation 4–5** as canonical windows into the church’s *leitourgia* under the **ascended Son**. Clary consistently insists that **Reformed worship** is not merely expressionistic devotion but **covenantal event**, a Spirit-constituted ascent to **Zion above**, where the **people of God** commune by **Word and sacrament** with the living **Lord**.

At the level of norms and rules, Clary articulates the **regulative principle of worship** in a rich covenantal idiom. He argues that the **Westminster Confession 21** and **Directory for the Public Worship of God** do not merely draw a negative fence against human innovations but positively order the church’s **dialogue with God**. This **dialogical principle** presents worship as a divine initiative and human response sequence. God calls by the **Word**, cleanses through **confession and absolution** grounded in **Christ’s priesthood**, consecrates by **Scripture reading, preaching, prayer, and song**, communes by the **Lord’s Supper**, and commissions with the **benediction**. The point is not liturgical aesthetics but **covenantal form**. For Clary, the elements authorized by the **regulative principle** are the very **means of grace** by which the risen Christ builds his church, and the ordinary shape of Reformed liturgy choreographs the **gospel** itself as patterned **covenant fellowship**.

Clary’s historical range extends to **patristic sources** that many Reformed readers pass by too quickly. He often cites **Justin Martyr’s First Apology** on the Lord’s Day gathering, **Hippolytus’s Apostolic Tradition**, and **Cyril of Jerusalem’s Mystagogical Catecheses**, though always under the supremacy of **Scripture** and the **confessional standards**. He is persuaded that a chastened *lex orandi lex credendi* can serve Reformed catholicity if and only if *lex credendi* as articulated in **Calvin**, **Heidelberg Catechism**, and **Westminster Larger Catechism** rules the *lex orandi*. Thus he can commend ancient patterns such as the *sursum corda* or the regular reading of **Scripture** without granting **sacerdotalism** or **sacramental ex opere operato** efficacy. The retrieval is not nostalgic but hermeneutical. It seeks to strengthen Reformed clarity on **Word-sacrament centrality** by learning from the pre-Constantinian and catechetically robust church how to order worship in service of **doctrine** and **discipleship**.

With respect to the **Lord’s Supper**, Clary advances a classical **Reformed doctrine of spiritual presence** tied to **union with Christ** and the **Spirit’s agency** in the church’s ascent. The Supper is a true **means of grace** wherein Christ communicates himself in his benefits to faith according to **Calvin’s autotheos** Christology and eucharistic realism that is neither **Lutheran consubstantiation** nor **Zwinglian memorialism**. The logic of **ascension and session** secures the Supper’s directionality. The risen Christ does not descend to local altars, but by the **Spirit** raises the assembly to **commune at the heavenly table**. Clary labors to show how this eschatological realism both protects **WCF 29** and renews pastoral confidence to administer the Supper as covenant nourishment. He frequently underscores **fencing the table**, **self-examination**, and the **pastoral charge** as dimensions of the Supper’s covenantal gravity.

On **preaching** and **public prayer**, Clary aligns with **Hughes Oliphant Old** in emphasizing the **reading and preaching of Scripture** as the keystone of **Reformed liturgy**. The sermon is not an inspirational aside but the **voice of Christ** addressing his covenant people through the **Word**. Clary therefore defends lectio continua, robust **pastoral prayers**, and **psalm-rich congregational song**. He esteems metrical **psalmody** and creedal confession as tools of catechesis, while allowing for well-vetted **hymnody** that meets biblical criteria. Music is never autonomous aesthetics but a form of **didactic praise**. The mode of speech that pervades the service must be shaped by **Scripture**, so that as **Colossians 3** commands, **the Word of Christ dwells richly** in the congregation through **psalms and hymns and spiritual songs** interpreted within a canonical frame.

Clary’s constructive work also engages contemporary voices such as **Nicholas Wolterstorff** and **James K. A. Smith**. With **Wolterstorff**, he appreciates the moral seriousness of **liturgy as love of neighbor** and the integrity of **action theory**, though he insists that Christian liturgy cannot be reduced to **performative justice** detached from **covenantal communion**. With **Smith**, he welcomes the thesis that we are **liturgical animals** whose loves are trained by **practices**, but he resists any ontological account of **sacramentality** that blurs the **Creator-creature distinction** or eclipses the **regulative principle of worship**. Clary’s dialogical posture also addresses **Roman Catholic** and **Eastern Orthodox** accounts of **eucharistic sacrifice** and **iconodulia**, pressing the **Reformed doctrine of the finished work of Christ**, **the Second Commandment**, and **divine simplicity** as non-negotiable dogmatic guardrails for worship.

A persistent theme in Clary’s lectures since 2019 has been **Sabbath eschatology** and the **Lord’s Day** as covenant gift. He draws on **Vos** and **Kline** to argue that the weekly rest is a **proleptic share** in the **consummation**, the church’s time-indexed participation in the **age to come**. This informs his exhortations regarding **morning and evening worship**, the sanctification of the day, and the church’s identity as a **pilgrim people** who gather to receive **Christ and his benefits**. Here he deploys the language of **covenant renewal under the Word**, careful to define renewal not as a new covenant transaction but as the **Spirit’s reapplication** of **Christ’s finished covenant obedience** through the **means of grace**. The entire liturgy, in his account, rehearses and re-enacts the **gospel drama** in a way that is simultaneously doctrinally precise, historically conscious, and pastorally accessible.

Clary’s pedagogical footprint is found in a cluster of essays from roughly 2016 to 2023 in **OPC** publications and in the **Reformed Forum Academy** courses on **Reformed worship**. These materials cover the **elements and forms** of worship, the shape of the **Service of the Lord’s Day**, the theology of the **Lord’s Supper**, and a tour through **patristic and Reformed sources**. In these works he trades in the key categories of **regulative principle**, **dialogical principle**, **means of grace**, and **heavenly assembly**. While avoiding antiquarianism, he commends certain ancient features such as a robust **call to worship**, the congregational **Amen**, the *sursum corda* as an anaphoral posture that aligns with the **ascension**, and kneaded **Scripture-saturated prayer**. In every case the guiding axiom remains the **sufficiency of Scripture** as confessed in **WCF 1** and enacted in **WCF 21**.

The pastoral application of Clary’s theology often addresses questions of **liturgical novelty**, **mission**, and **form**. He argues that the **mission of the church** is not advanced by creative liturgical experiments driven by market logic, but by faithful administration of **Word and sacrament** that displays the **wisdom of God**. The church’s **public worship** is itself the primary **outpost of the kingdom**, a foretaste of the **new creation** rather than a platform for cultural production. He warns that when **Reformed churches** loosen their grip on the **regulative principle**, they often substitute human eloquence or technological spectacle for **Christ’s appointed means**. By contrast, a liturgy that lets **Scripture** speak at length, that prays boldly, that sings truth, and that feeds the flock at the **Table**, becomes the site where **Christ shepherds** his people and equips them for witness.

In sum, Clary’s enduring contribution is to press the entire **Reformed liturgical inheritance** through the sieve of **ascension**, **heavenly Zion**, and **covenantal means of grace**, thereby showing how the church’s Sunday service is the rendezvous point of **biblical theology** and **confessional practice**. He balances **patristic retrieval** and **Reformed specificity**, so that catholic depth and confessional clarity mutually reinforce. His lectures and essays from 2016 to 2023 offer pastors and students a map by which to align **form and substance**, **ordo and dogma**, *lex orandi* and **lex credendi**, with the **Word of God** standing as the final arbiter.

From a Reformed and WTS evaluation, the strengths are manifest in the tight integration of **regulative principle of worship**, **Christ’s heavenly session**, and **means of grace**, along with a judicious **patristic retrieval** disciplined by **confessional normativity**. Potential tensions include the use of **covenant-renewal** idiom, which can drift toward **Federal Vision** ambiguities if not carefully tethered to **imputed righteousness** and **once-for-all atonement**. The appeal to **patristic forms** invites scrutiny to ensure no slide into **sacerdotalism** or **iconic aesthetics** that conflict with the **Second Commandment**. Alternatives within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would press even more explicit confessional warrant for any proposed **liturgical forms**, distinguish sharply between **elements** and **circumstances**, and heighten catechesis on **spiritual presence** to inoculate against both **memorialism** and **sacramentalism**. Yet on the fundamentals of **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, and **nature**, Clary’s account resonates with a WTS-shaped commitment to **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **Christ’s kingship over worship**, and the **church’s pilgrimage to heavenly Mount Zion**.
