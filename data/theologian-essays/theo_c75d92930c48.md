### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
James Davison Hunter emerged in the late twentieth century as a leading evangelical interpreter of American culture, a sociologist situated within the humanities turn toward **cultural sociology** and the contested terrain of the **culture wars**. Working at the **University of Virginia** and founding the **Institute for Advanced Studies in Culture** in 1995, he analyzed how moral visions become social facts through **institutions, elites, and networks** rather than simply through ideas in the abstract. His core intuition is Weberian and Durkheimian at once, a **Weberian verstehen** of meaning that is embedded in a **Durkheimian moral order**, where symbols, rituals, and law stabilize an ultimate vision of the good. The method is interpretive, historically attuned, and institutional, a chastened **critical realism** that seeks to describe what culture is and how it changes before prescribing what Christians should do.

From the outset Hunter wrote as a son of broad **evangelicalism** addressing evangelicals’ quandary within **modernity**, namely how to sustain orthodoxy while inhabiting the modern *saeculum*. He mapped the interplay of **plausibility structures**, **symbolic capital**, and **institutional density**, drawing on **Peter Berger** on the social construction of reality and on **Robert Bellah** on civil religion. Late modern fragmentation and the erosion of thick moral authority produce voluntarist selves, which for Hunter means that Christian faith requires not only proclamation but **institutional embodiment**. This methodological posture grounds his later normative counsel, a call to **faithful presence** that presupposes an Augustinian **ordo amoris** but insists that love becomes public through concrete **institutional vocations**.

#### 2. Early studies of evangelicalism and modernity
Hunter’s first two major works, **American Evangelicalism: Conservative Religion and the Quandary of Modernity** in 1983 and **Evangelicalism: The Coming Generation** in 1987, diagnosed the adaptive strategies by which conservative Protestants negotiated the pressures of **modernity**. He argued that evangelical survival in the twentieth century came not from retreat but from constructing a resilient **subculture** marked by robust **institutional infrastructure**. Schools, publishers, missions, and congregations formed a plausibility network that translated **orthodoxy** into modern idioms while guarding the boundary between church and world through ritualized **moral distinctions**.

The analysis cut against simple declension narratives and against triumphalist **worldview reductionism**. Hunter contended that evangelicalism could not overcome modernity by merely refining **apologetics** or intensifying **activism** because culture is not primarily cognitive assent but a **symbolic and institutional ecology**. Borrowing from Durkheim on the sacred and profane, he described evangelical identity as a patterned moral order anchored in a transcendent **authority**. The durability of that order, however, depends on **institutional density** and **elite formation** that are capable of sustaining norms across generations, themes that foreshadow his later analysis of **cultural change** and **faithful presence**.

#### 3. Culture wars and the structure of moral conflict
The breakthrough book, **Culture Wars: The Struggle to Define America** in 1991, gave a name and a topology to the moral conflicts of late twentieth-century America. Hunter rejected purely economic or demographic explanations and proposed a deep alignment around **orthodoxy versus progressivism**, where orthodoxy signifies confidence in a definable, external, and transcendent **moral authority**, while progressivism locates authority in evolving **experiential and pragmatic** judgments. This polarity reordered American public life across denominations and parties, explaining why a conservative Catholic and an evangelical Baptist might share a public cause while disagreeing on ecclesial polity. The battles over **abortion**, **family policy**, **arts and censorship**, **education**, and **constitutional interpretation** were not surface skirmishes but the juridical and aesthetic expression of rival **sacred canopies**.

Hunter’s sequel, **Before the Shooting Begins** in 1994, pressed for procedural virtues and civic patience within democratic discourse, a plea for **civic pluralism** without yielding on **convictional orthodoxy**. The sociological claim was stark: moral conflict is inescapable in a pluralist order because it reflects rival **ultimate goods**, not mere interests. The practical implication was equally stark: if conflict is about sacred authority, then neither techniques of compromise nor the expansion of rights talk can resolve it. Only institutions that embody substantive **moral formation** can produce citizens capable of disagreement without dehumanization. This reinforced his emphasis on **symbolic power** embedded in institutions rather than the myth of a purely neutral public square.

#### 4. Moral formation and the loss of teleology
With **The Death of Character** in 2000, Hunter shifted from macro conflict to the micro and meso levels of **moral education**. He argued that American schooling had traded Aristotelian **virtue** and teleological accounts of the good for **therapeutic individualism** and procedural **values clarification**, producing thin moral agents unable to say why courage or temperance is good. Drawing on **Alasdair MacIntyre** and classical moral philosophy, he showed how the erosion of **teleology** and the privatization of comprehensive goods undermined any substantive **formation**. The result is institutional incoherence, where appeals to character are severed from the **traditions of practice** that give the virtues shape and direction.

Hunter’s positive proposal pointed again to **institutional ecology**. Families, congregations, schools, and civic associations must coordinate the **lex orandi lex credendi** of a community so that the grammar of the good is performed, not merely stated. This is not a call for theocracy but a plea for thick **mediating institutions** that sustain a lived **moral anthropology** over time. He concluded that character cannot be made by technique or curriculum alone because it requires a community’s enacted **narrative telos**, a recognizable picture of human flourishing under a shared **moral authority**.

#### 5. To Change the World and the critique of evangelical strategies
Hunter’s most programmatic work, **To Change the World** in 2010, is both a theory of culture and a practical theology of public life. He argues that culture changes through **dense networks of elites** positioned within strategic **institutions** that produce and legitimate symbols, artifacts, and norms. Ideas matter, but only as they are embedded in organizational power and **social capital**. This yields a bracing critique of three evangelical strategies. The **defensive-against** strategy relies on political combat and culture-war mobilization. The **relevance-to** strategy dilutes orthodoxy through seeker-sensitive adaptation and therapeutic translation. The **purity-from** strategy withdraws into sectarian enclaves with little institutional ambition. All three misunderstand cultural change and succumb to the **will to power** or to an equally problematic aversion to power as such.

Hunter proposes **faithful presence** as an alternative. The phrase names a posture of patient, covenantal presence with and for the world **coram Deo**, rooted in **Jeremiah 29** and Augustinian **ordo amoris**. Christians are called to inhabit vocations in the arts, law, medicine, education, business, and politics, seeking the shalom of the city while refusing the idolatry of **politicization**. Institutional innovation matters, but it must be animated by love that is ordered to God, neighbor, and the creation, a differentiated **sphere sovereignty** without triumphalism. In this vision the church resists ressentiment and the instrumental use of prayer and worship for political ends, offering instead a liturgy of **presence** that forms a people capable of **public faithfulness** over the long term.

#### 6. Interlocutors and contested alignments
Throughout his corpus Hunter engages classic typologies and contemporary thinkers. He stands in critical dialogue with **H. Richard Niebuhr** on Christ and culture, judging the typology insightful but descriptively thin regarding **institutional mechanisms**. He appreciates **Hauerwas** and **Yoder** for naming the temptation of **Constantinianism**, yet he worries that a strong purity posture yields **institutional marginality** and cedes cultural production to rival liturgies. He interacts with **Abraham Kuyper** and the neo-Calvinist tradition, affirming **sphere sovereignty** and the comprehensiveness of **Christ’s lordship**, while warning that a triumphalist **transformationalism** often underestimates the recalcitrance of entrenched **elites and structures**.

Hunter’s later essays and public lectures weave in themes from **Nietzsche** on the will to power and **Charles Taylor** on the conditions of belief in a secular age. He borrows selectively from **Bourdieu** on **habitus** and **symbolic capital** to explain why cultural change travels along institutional arteries rather than through mass opinion alone. The result is an evangelical cultural theory that is neither sectarian withdrawal nor culture-war pugilism, but a call to **institutional vocation** ordered by love. Even where he is not explicit, the polemical target remains **worldview reductionism**, the assumption that intellectual clarity alone is sufficient for transformation without the slow labor of organization and craft.

#### 7. Normative depth and ecclesial implications
While a sociologist by training, Hunter’s work carries theological weight in its account of the **church in the world**. His **faithful presence** imagines the church as **ecclesia peregrinans**, a pilgrim people who witness within the structures of the *saeculum* without mastering them. The counsel is not quietism. It is a reorientation from movement-building as spectacle to **vocation** as long obedience, from the rage of the **culture wars** to the patience of **institution building** under the authority of Scripture and the guidance of the **Spirit**. He commends a postpolitical stance, not apolitical withdrawal, where politics is relativized within a fuller **theology of creation and providence**.

This has implications for **discipleship**, **public liturgies**, and **catechesis**. For Hunter, worship and formation are not private. They are the material engine of **public presence**, the training of citizens whose loves are rightly ordered. The church’s **lex orandi** shapes its **habitus**, which in turn shapes its competence in arts, law, and civic stewardship. The vision assumes a rich **doctrine of creation**, a sober **hamartiology** that anticipates structural resistance, and a tempered **eschatology** that avoids overrealized triumph. Put simply, his theology of culture is Augustinian in mood, Kuyperian in scope, and Weberian in method, trained on producing **faithful institutions** rather than winning endless symbolic skirmishes.

#### 8. Reception, influence, and critique
Hunter’s categories have traveled widely across evangelical higher education, think tanks, philanthropic strategy, and pastoral training. The language of **faithful presence** is echoed in seminary syllabi, university mission statements, and the strategic plans of Christian foundations that seek **institutional leverage** rather than episodic activism. The analysis of **elites and networks** has influenced debates about Christian participation in the arts and the academy, encouraging believers to pursue excellence as **craft** under divine calling. Parallel conversations have emerged with **James K. A. Smith** on cultural **liturgies** and with **Charles Taylor** on secular fractures, showing how Hunter’s institutional account dovetails with attention to **embodied formation**.

Critics have pressed hard at several points. Some argue that the elite model understates the power of **popular culture**, social movements, and digital networks that reconfigure influence more horizontally. Others have worried that the postpolitical tone risks moral quietism in the face of grave injustice, where a robust **public theology** might mandate more direct political challenge. Neo-Calvinist voices have contended that Hunter underestimates the legitimacy of **worldview** as an integrative account of creation and vocation, while anabaptist readers have charged that **faithful presence** still risks complicity with the **principalities and powers**. Hunter’s response has consistently redirected the debate to the question of **institutional formation** and the dangers of ressentiment, suggesting that without love rightly ordered the church’s public action becomes a mirror of the world it seeks to heal.

#### 9. Doctrinal accents within evangelical tradition
Though not a systematician, Hunter’s work implies a set of doctrinal accents. On **revelation and authority**, he sides with **orthodoxy** by insisting that public life cannot be sustained by proceduralism alone and requires a transcendent moral **source**. On **anthropology**, he assumes both a capacity for **virtue** and a bent toward disordered loves, a classically Augustinian tension. On **ecclesiology**, he elevates the **church as formative community** whose practices yield public fruit, yet he insists that much of the church’s influence will be mediated through **vocation** in non-ecclesial institutions. On **providence and eschatology**, he commends patience and chastened hope, resisting both apocalyptic despair and realizationist optimism. The grammar of **faithful presence** thus orients evangelical mission away from culture-war politics toward **institutional stewardship**, *cura animarum*, and a long view of **cultural change** that honors both common grace and the reality of the **antithesis**.

This doctrinal frame yields a pastoral strategy. Leaders should resist the allure of **movementism** and its hunger for immediate wins. Instead they should cultivate **habitus** through catechesis, craft excellence, and organizational durability, trusting that over decades such faithfulness can alter the **symbolic order**. The proposal is neither compliant nor combative. It is a re-scripting of Christian agency under the primacy of **love**, aware that in a pluralist order persuasion often follows presence, and presence requires **institutions** that do not burn out when news cycles shift.

#### 10. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a classical Reformed standpoint, including the sensibilities of **Westminster Theological Seminary**, Hunter’s contribution is salutary in its insistence on the **antithesis** between orthodoxy and progressivism and in its sober account of **institutional power** within providence. His critique of **politicization** resonates with a calibrated **two kingdoms** account that relativizes civil authority under **Christ’s lordship**. His emphasis on **vocation**, **sphere sovereignty**, and the long arc of **institutional stewardship** coheres with a Reformed doctrine of **creation and common grace**. Yet several tensions remain. First, the sociological grammar sometimes risks a **reductionism** that leaves **special revelation** underarticulated as the principium of public reason for the church. Second, the stress on **elites and networks** can obscure the ordinary **means of grace** as the primary engine of ecclesial vitality and public fruit, which in the Reformed tradition are Word, sacrament, and prayer animating all vocations. Third, the postpolitical posture may underweight the positive office of the **magistrate** under the **lex Dei**, where principled political action is not ressentiment but service to neighbor within covenantal order. A Reformed alternative would integrate Hunter’s institutional wisdom with explicit **covenant theology**, deepen the centrality of **public worship** as the fountain of **habitus**, and articulate a principled **natural law** and **Scripture** harmony for public reasoning. Taken together, the Reformed reception can affirm **faithful presence** as a needed antidote to culture-war exhaustion while replumbing its foundations in classic **doctrine** and the ordinary **ministries** through which Christ extends his kingdom.
