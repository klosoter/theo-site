### ESSAY
William T. Cavanaugh, born in 1962 and formed within the postconciliar **Roman Catholic** world, emerged as a leading voice in contemporary **political theology** by placing the **Eucharist** at the heart of an ecclesially thick account of public life. His early immersion in Chile during the last years of the **Pinochet** regime supplied the lived archive behind his signature claim that the modern **nation-state** disciplines bodies and imaginations more powerfully than many church leaders dare to concede. This biographical entanglement catalyzed a method that weds **genealogy** in the vein of **Michel Foucault** to **Augustinian** and **Thomist** ressourcement, producing a critique of **liberalism** that is neither secular nor nostalgic. The combination of **Catholic social thought** emphases like **subsidiarity** and the **common good** with a robust **sacramental ontology** animates Cavanaugh's conviction that the church is not a private association but a visible **polis** constituted by **Word and sacrament**. The institutional setting of his teaching at the University of St. Thomas and later at DePaul University’s Center for **World Catholicism** sharpened the global horizon of his work, but the constant thread is the reimagination of power and freedom through **Eucharistic politics**.

At the level of intellectual context, Cavanaugh situates his claims against the long shadow of the **Enlightenment** settlement that privatized religion and absolutized the **sovereign state**. He aligns with **Henri de Lubac**'s retrieval of the **corpus mysticum** tradition to argue that the **Eucharist** does not merely symbolize communal unity but effects a real participation that shapes political identity. The trope of the **migration of the holy** signals his conviction that sacral energies have not vanished but have been redirected toward the modern **state** and the **market**, creating rival liturgies of belonging. Drawing from **Augustine's** two cities without collapsing them, Cavanaugh imagines the **church** as an alternative public that refuses the **Hobbesian** picture of prepolitical violence and **Rousseau's** civil religion alike. He repudiates the Weberian monopoly-of-violence thesis as the decisive horizon for political imagination and proposes **liturgy** as the formative practice in which a different sovereignty is learned.

The breakthrough work, **Torture and Eucharist: Theology, Politics, and the Body of Christ** in 1998, offers a concrete case study of **biopolitics** and ecclesial response in Chile from 1973 to 1990. Here Cavanaugh uses **Foucault**'s insights on disciplinary power to show how **torture** atomizes communities by isolating bodies and disrupting memory, thereby creating subjects fit for **state** sovereignty. He argues that parts of the Chilean **Catholic Church** colluded in the privatization of faith, treating the **Eucharist** as cultic rite rather than as the formation of a public body, while other sectors, notably the **Vicaria de la Solidaridad**, pursued a counter-politics grounded in public acts of witness, **martyrdom**, and communal solidarity. The book's central claim is that the **Eucharist** counters torture not by offering a rival violence but by reconstituting the **body of Christ** as a site of truthful speech, forgiveness, and embodied resistance. The **corpus mysticum** emerges as a political body with its own jurisdictional claims, disciplined by **confession** and **baptism** as practices that make a people.

The argument widens in **Theopolitical Imagination: Discovering the Liturgy as a Political Act in an Age of Global Consumerism** in 2002, where Cavanaugh contends that **liturgy** is not a symbol of politics but a politics in act. He presses the contrast between the **liberal** image of the church as a voluntary association and the **Catholic** vision of the church as a sacrament of unity that entails alternative forms of distribution, time, and authority. In explicit opposition to **Hobbes** and **Rousseau**, who respectively imagine the state pacifying nature or sacralizing the general will, Cavanaugh reads the **Eucharist** as the discipline that trains desire away from acquisitive autonomy toward shared reception from Christ. He refuses both **Constantinianism** and quietist withdrawal, insisting that the church's **liturgy** does not need state validation to be public, and that the **polis ecclesiae** can host genuinely political deliberation and action oriented to the **common good**. The conceptual hinge is the conviction that visibility in the **church** is not reducible to legal recognition by the **state**, but is enacted in practices that render Christ's body socially real.

The work for which Cavanaugh is most widely cited outside theology is **The Myth of Religious Violence** in 2009, a sweeping **genealogical** critique of the thesis that religion is uniquely prone to violence. He interrogates stories of the European **Wars of Religion**, showing through **historical** analysis that confessional conflict intertwined with emergent **state** formation, and he argues that the secularist distinction between rational politics and irrational religion is a legitimating narrative for modern coercion. Drawing on **Talal Asad** and contesting **Rawls** and **Habermas**, Cavanaugh shows how the category of religion is constructed to confine robust theological claims to the private sphere while granting the **nation-state** a monopoly on legitimate violence. The polemical payoff is that appeals to suppress religion in the name of peace often mask the sacralization of national purposes. Theologically, the work reasserts that **Christian** discourse about God is not a threat to public reason but a necessary challenge to any polity that would declare itself eschatological.

Cavanaugh's economic counter-narrative arrives in **Being Consumed: Economics and Christian Desire** in 2008, where he deploys **Thomas Aquinas** on ends and **virtue** to critique the liberal picture of freedom as unconstrained choice. He holds that markets are not neutral mechanisms, that **desire** is educable, and that the **Eucharist** orders consumption toward communion rather than scarcity. The book examines fair trade, living wages, local production, and the phenomenon of brand fetishization as rival **liturgies** shaping the self. Cavanaugh resists both laissez-faire **capitalism** and statist collectivism, arguing instead for an **economy of gift** grounded in the **common good** and **subsidiarity**, where local communities exercise real agency. By staging concrete examples of supply chains and their human costs, he invites the **church** to practice economic discipleship that mirrors **Eucharistic** sharing, including patronage of local producers and intentional practices of hospitality.

The political-theological synthesis expands further in **Migrations of the Holy: God, State, and the Political Meaning of the Church** in 2011, where Cavanaugh tracks the transfer of sacral devotion from **church** to **nation** and **market**, resulting in civil religions that demand ultimate loyalty. He contends that modern constitutional orders, especially in the United States, are not secular in the sense of neutral, but are carriers of a rival **soteriology** promising peace and prosperity through **sovereignty** and consumption. The church's task is not to baptize these orders but to unmask their liturgies and to form a people around practices like **baptism**, **Eucharist**, and works of mercy that display a different **eschatology**. In **Field Hospital: The Church's Engagement with a Wounded World** in 2015, echoing **Pope Francis**' image of the church as a field hospital, Cavanaugh applies his framework to questions of migration, war, and economic exploitation, insisting that ecclesial care is not apolitical charity but a challenge to the grammar of **security** and **borders**. His longstanding institutional labor, including co-editing the **Blackwell Companion to Political Theology** in 2004, situates his program within an ecumenical conversation on **sovereignty**, **law**, and **public theology**.

Across these works, the doctrinal backbone is a **sacramental ontology** derived from **de Lubac**'s account of the **Eucharist-church** relation and disciplined by **Augustinian** suspicion of idolatry. The **corpus mysticum** is neither an invisible spiritual metaphor nor a univocal conflation with the **state**; it is the real body that binds Christians to Christ and one another, generating practices of truthful speech, nonviolence, and hospitality. Cavanaugh's ecclesiology is unapologetically visible and concrete, locating authority in the **episcopally** ordered body that celebrates **liturgy** and practices **discipline** as a political pedagogy. Along the way he borrows from **Foucault** without capitulating to nominalism, transforming genealogy into a theology of **memory** and **martyrdom**. He consistently refuses hermeneutics of scarcity, arguing that the **Eucharist** witnesses to divine plenitude and thereby reconfigures Christian engagement with **economics**, **war**, and **nation**.

Critics have charged Cavanaugh with sectarianism, romanticizing locality, and underestimating the goods secured by modern **liberal** orders. He responds that the **church** is catholic rather than sectarian, that localism is not isolationism but **subsidiarity**, and that the costs of modern sovereignty include routinized violence hidden by myths of neutrality. He engages **John Milbank** and **Radical Orthodoxy** in a friendly yet distinct register, rejecting nostalgia for medieval **Christendom** while insisting on the church's public status. With **Hauerwas**, he insists that character and practices matter, yet his **Catholic** metaphysics grounds these practices in sacrament rather than in purely ethical communal will. The polarity of **Constantinianism** and withdrawal is refused; instead, he proposes a **counter-politics** of ecclesial presence that witnesses to Christ's reign without grasping the sword of **Caesar**.

Cavanaugh's argumentative style depends on **historical** case studies, analytical **genealogy**, and sustained doctrinal retrieval. The dialogical field is wide, from **Weber** on rationalization to **Rawls** on public reason, but the center holds: the modern **state** and **market** are not final horizons, and the **church** is not a chaplaincy to either. The nexus of **Eucharist**, **economy**, and **sovereignty** provides a single through-line by which he reads questions of migration, torture, consumerism, and nationalism. His consistent recourse to **Augustine** and **Aquinas** signals a confidence that thick Christian speech belongs in public, not as bargaining chip in a pluralist forum, but as authoritative proclamation of a different city in via.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary readers will recognize both provocations and convergences in Cavanaugh's **theopolitical** vision. There is significant common cause in his **anti-idolatry** critique of the **nation-state** and **market**, his Augustinian account of disordered **desire**, and his insistence that the **church** is a visible people under the **Word**. At the same time, tensions arise around his **sacramental ontology** and the claim that the **Eucharist** constitutes a polity, which challenges **Reformed** accounts of the **Lord's Supper** as spiritual feeding by the **Spirit** rather than as ontological reconstitution. A Westminster reading would commend his exposure of the **myth of religious neutrality** while replacing his migration-of-the-holy thesis with **covenant theology** and **sphere sovereignty**, locating political order under **Christ's mediatorial kingship** yet distinguishing properly the ministries of **church** and **civil magistrate** in a chastened **two-kingdoms** key. The Reformed alternative would affirm his warning against civil religion, insist on the primacy of **preaching** regulated by the **Word**, and frame economic and political discipleship as obedience within covenantal vocations rather than as participation in a quasi-ontological ecclesial body, thereby preserving catholicity of critique without granting the **state** or **market** any sacramental status.
