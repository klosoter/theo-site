### TITLE
The Council of Trent fixed Roman Catholicism in a permanent Counter‑Reformation posture by dogmatically rejecting the Reformation on **Scripture, justification, and the church**, and that post‑Tridentine settlement still defines the central Reformed–Catholic fault line.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Council of Trent** met in three main phases from **1545–1563** in Trent and briefly Bologna as Rome’s structured response to the **Protestant Reformation**.
- Shaped by late **medieval scholasticism** and Renaissance Catholic reform currents, Trent codified a confessional Catholic identity alongside the rise of **Luther**, **Calvin**, and the emerging nation states.

- Trent’s method is conciliar and magisterial, treating the **church’s teaching office** as the proximate rule of faith that normatively interprets Scripture and tradition.
- The Council assumes a strong **scholastic** use of **reason** within faith, deploying precise definitions and anathemas to safeguard doctrines and practices.
- Revelation is mediated through **Scripture and tradition** as a single deposit, authoritatively expounded by the **Roman pontiff** and bishops in council rather than by private judgment.

- The **Decree on Justification** (Session 6, **1547**) articulates a doctrine of **habitual grace and inherent righteousness** over against Reformation sola fide.
- The **Decree on the Sacraments** (especially Sessions 7 and 13, **1547–1551**) codifies the seven **sacraments**, affirms baptismal regeneration, and defines **transubstantiation** and eucharistic sacrifice.
- The **Decree on Scripture and Tradition** (Session 4, **1546**) canonizes the **Vulgate**, includes the **deuterocanonical books**, and anathematizes Reformation views of the biblical canon and sufficiency.
- Various disciplinary canons on **bishops, clergy, and reform** contribute to the shape of early modern **Roman Catholic ecclesiology** and centralized authority.

- Trent is decisive for doctrines of **revelation and Scripture**, fixing the relation of written Scripture to unwritten tradition and to the magisterium.
- It is foundational for **soteriology and grace**, including justification, free will, cooperation with grace, and the sacramental economy.
- It determines the Roman Catholic understanding of **church and sacraments**, including hierarchy, the mass as propitiatory sacrifice, and the necessity of the visible institution for salvation.

- Reformed examiners will want Trent read as the hardened alternative to **sola Scriptura** and **sola fide**, especially via the **Decree on Justification** and the canon of Scripture.
- They will expect you to locate later Roman Catholic theology, including **Vatican I** and **Vatican II**, as essentially post‑Tridentine refinements rather than radical breaks.

- Comparison handles will include **Trent vs Luther** on justification by faith alone and the bondage of the will.
- Examiners may also draw you to **Trent vs Calvin** on Scripture, sacramental presence, and the nature of the visible church and its authority.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
The **Council of Trent** is not a single theologian but a corporate doctrinal engine, shaped by the papacy of **Paul III**, **Julius III**, and **Pius IV**, convened in the imperial city of Trent from 1545 to 1563 in three distinct periods. Its proximate context is the shattering of late medieval Western Christendom through the **Lutheran** and **Reformed** Reformations, the spread of **humanist biblical scholarship**, and internal calls for moral and institutional reform. The council was dominated by Italian and Spanish bishops and theologians, many trained in **Thomist** or **Scotist scholasticism**, alongside a few moderate voices seeking reconciliation with Protestants. The driving problem Trent seeks to solve is this: how can the Roman church preserve doctrinal and sacramental continuity with the **medieval Latin tradition**, respond to the critiques of **Luther** and **Calvin**, and reassert its jurisdictional and soteriological authority in a fractured Europe. It aims both to address abuses that fuelled reform, such as the sale of indulgences, and to give a definitive dogmatic rejection of key **Protestant doctrines** that threatened the Roman ecclesiastical and sacramental system.

The Council’s internal politics reflected the tension between those, including some **imperial legates**, who hoped for a limited doctrinal accommodation to bring back moderate Protestants, and the more rigorist Roman theologians influenced by **Cajetan** and the **Sorbonne**, who feared any concession to sola Scriptura or sola fide. The repeated suspensions and relocations of the council, notably the move to **Bologna** and the long gap between 1547 and 1551, reveal the influence of the **Habsburg** and **French** crowns, each suspicious of the other’s control over the council. Yet over time the papal party gained the upper hand, especially in the final phase under **Pius IV**, so that the council became more clearly an instrument of Roman consolidation. By its end, Trent had not only rejected Protestantism but had effectively frozen Roman dogma in a **Counter‑Reformation** mold, creating a standard to which later Catholic theology must constantly refer, often described as **Tridentine Catholicism**.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Trent’s method is that of an **ecumenical council** in the Roman sense, claiming the guidance of the Holy Spirit and the authority of the universal episcopate under the pope as successor of **Peter**. Its self‑understanding is that the **church**, not the individual, is the normative interpreter of divine revelation, so that the council’s decrees and canons articulate what had always been believed in substance, even when the formulations are new. The famous **Decree on Scripture and Tradition** in Session 4, 1546, speaks of the Gospel as contained in both written books and unwritten traditions, received from Christ and the apostles and preserved in the church, and it insists that these are to be accepted with equal pious affection and reverence. This reveals a method in which **Scripture** is materially central yet formally subordinated to the interpretive authority of **tradition** as embodied in the magisterium. The council explicitly authorizes the **Vulgate** as authentic in public use, functioning as a liturgical and doctrinal norm over against proliferating vernacular translations that fuelled Protestant teaching.

Reason at Trent is subordinated to and enlisted in the service of dogmatic and disciplinary determinations but is hardly absent. The style of the **canons with attached anathemas** reflects a scholastic precision about definitions, such as the use of **substantia** in defining transubstantiation and the distinction between **habitual** and **actual** grace in the Decree on Justification in Session 6. Yet human reason is never elevated to an independent norm; rather, it is the instrument of the teaching church as it clarifies and defends the deposit of faith against heresy. Experience is not foregrounded as in later **pietist** or **liberal** theologies, though the council is clearly responding to historical crises and abuses; it legislates for concrete pastoral problems such as absentee bishops and uneducated clergy. History is seen as the unfolding of the one Roman tradition, so that appeal is made to earlier councils like **Nicaea** and **Lateran IV**; but the historical consciousness remains implicit, not reflective in the way found later in **Newman** or modern Catholic ressourcement. In tension with Reformed method, which insists that **Scripture alone** is the inspired and sufficient norm and that all ecclesial authority is ministerial and fallible, Trent binds revelation, tradition, and church together so tightly that the magisterium becomes the living rule of faith.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
On revelation and Scripture the confessional Reformed baseline, as in the **Westminster Confession**, is that the whole counsel of God concerning all things necessary for his own glory and man’s salvation is either expressly set down in Scripture or by good and necessary consequence may be deduced from Scripture, and that Scripture alone is the infallible rule of faith. In contrast, the **Decree on Scripture and Tradition** at Trent affirms a dual yet single source view of revelation, speaking of one Gospel transmitted in two modes, Scripture and unwritten traditions, both to be received with equal reverence. It approves the Latin **Vulgate** as authentic in public reading and disputation, and it adds the **deuterocanonical books** such as Tobit and 1 and 2 Maccabees to the canon, explicitly rejecting Protestant restrictions to the Hebrew canon. Against figures like **Martin Chemnitz** and the *Examen Concilii Tridentini*, Trent resists sola Scriptura and also refuses the principle that Scripture is clear in itself on saving doctrine, insisting instead on the need for the church’s judgment. This dogmatic choice sets up a direct and ongoing clash with Reformed doctrines of the self‑attesting, sufficient, and perspicuous **Word of God**.

On justification and grace the Reformed baseline is that sinners are justified before God by the imputed righteousness of **Christ** received by faith alone, which itself is the gift of God, apart from the merit of works, while good works are the necessary fruit of true faith and the evidence of justification. The **Decree on Justification** in Session 6 of 1547 offers a detailed alternative grounded in **Augustinian** and **Thomist** categories yet sharply opposed to Protestant formulations. Justification is treated as both the remission of sins and the sanctification and renewal of the inner man through the voluntary reception of grace and gifts, so that the justified are made inherently righteous by infused **habitual grace**. Faith is necessary as the beginning of salvation but is explicitly denied to justify alone; Trent condemns the notion of a fiducial faith that is sure of its own justification and anathematizes the imputation of Christ’s righteousness as the sole formal cause of justification. Human free will is said to be wounded by the fall yet not destroyed, so that the justified can cooperate with and merit an increase of grace and eternal life in virtue of God’s gracious promises. Here Trent opposes **Luther** and **Melanchthon** while aligning more with **Augustine against Pelagius**, though it stops short of the monergistic grace taught in the Reformed confessions.

On the sacraments and the church the Reformed baseline is that Christ instituted two sacraments, **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**, as signs and seals of the covenant of grace, that they are effectual only by the working of the Spirit and the faith of the recipient, and that there is no repetition of the sacrifice of Christ in the Supper. In the **Decree on the Sacraments** and the later sessions on the Eucharist, penance, and orders, Trent codifies seven **sacraments** as instituted by Christ and necessary means of grace. It affirms baptismal regeneration, teaching that baptism confers the remission of all sin and the infusion of sanctifying grace ex opere operato, and it anathematizes the denial that the sacraments contain and confer the grace they signify. On the Eucharist, Session 13 in 1551 defines **transubstantiation**, stating that the whole substance of the bread and wine is changed into the body and blood of Christ, and Session 22 describes the mass as a **propitiatory sacrifice** offered for the living and the dead. In opposition to **Calvin** and **Zwingli**, Trent rejects a purely spiritual presence and any denial of the sacrificial character of the mass, while grounding ecclesiology in a visible, hierarchical church in communion with the **Roman pontiff**. The church is treated as the necessary context and agent of sacramental grace, and implicit in Trent’s decrees is the later extra ecclesiam nulla salus formula as interpreted in a Roman sense.

On the Christian life, assurance, and discipline the Reformed baseline is that true believers may attain a real though not infallible assurance of salvation resting on the promise of God in Christ, the inward testimony of the Spirit, and the fruits of grace, and that good works are necessary as evidence but not as co‑causes of justification. Trent in its **Decree on Justification** condemns the Protestant doctrine of assurance as a carnal presumption, allowing only a conjectural or conditional hope of final perseverance except where special revelation has been granted. It insists that mortal sins committed after baptism cause the loss of justifying grace and must be remitted through the sacrament of **penance**, which includes contrition, confession to a priest, and satisfaction. Disciplinary canons throughout the council address clerical celibacy, the residence of bishops, and the establishment of **seminaries** to train clergy, embodying a vision of the Christian life that is sacramentally mediated, hierarchically supervised, and imposed by canon law. Against the moral laxity and abuses denounced by **Erasmus** and Protestant reformers, Trent does seek genuine reform, yet it reinforces the penitential system and the denial of evangelical assurance that the Reformed see as pastorally destructive and contrary to the **gospel of grace**.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians such as **Calvin**, **Beza**, and later **Turretin** read the Council of Trent as a decisive and tragic hardening of medieval error into irreformable dogma. Calvin’s **Antidote to the Council of Trent** systematically refutes the Tridentine canons, arguing that the council has anathematized not novel opinions but the apostolic doctrine of justification by faith alone and the biblical simplicity of the sacraments. Turretin’s **Institutes of Elenctic Theology** returns repeatedly to Trent as the authoritative Roman position to be critiqued on Scripture, the church, and the sacraments, treating Tridentine Catholicism as the main contemporary opponent. Later Reformed thinkers such as **Bavinck** and **Vos** see Trent as the point where the older, more fluid medieval tradition is crystallized into a fixed system that identifies the fullness of grace with the institutional and sacramental structures of Rome. Westminster examiners will insist that we firmly reject Trent’s denial of **sola Scriptura** and **sola fide**, its doctrine of transubstantiation and eucharistic sacrifice, and its treatment of justification as an intrinsic, cooperative process rather than a forensic act based on Christ’s imputed righteousness.

Yet from a Reformed perspective there are also things to learn from Trent. Its seriousness about doctrinal clarity, seen in its careful canons and anathemas, can shame a vague **Protestant ecclesial pluralism** that often treats dogma as negotiable. Trent’s commitment to clerical discipline and pastoral formation through **seminaries** highlights the importance of trained ministry, something the Reformed tradition also affirms in its own way. Furthermore, Trent’s insistence that grace is not a bare legal fiction but truly renews and sanctifies resonates with the Reformed emphasis, in **Calvin** and later in **Owen** and **Bavinck**, on the inseparability of justification and sanctification. A Westminster candidate should say that while the council fundamentally corrupted the gospel at crucial soteriological and ecclesiological points, it also preserved many catholic doctrines shared by the Reformed, such as **Trinitarian orthodoxy**, the full deity and humanity of Christ, and the objective reality of the church as the body of Christ in history.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, a safe opening sentence about the Council of Trent would stress its role as the definitive Roman **Counter‑Reformation** response to Protestantism and as the source of what we now call Tridentine Catholicism. For example, one could say: The Council of Trent from 1545 to 1563 codified Roman Catholic doctrine and discipline for the modern era, especially by rejecting Reformation teaching on Scripture, justification, and the sacraments. It is also safe and useful to speak of Trent as both defensive and reforming, since it did address real abuses while also closing the door on doctrinal reconciliation with the emerging **Reformed** and **Lutheran** churches.

Landmines lie especially in language that seems to minimize Trent’s opposition to the gospel as understood in the **Reformed confessions**. A candidate should avoid unqualified phrases like Trent as a legitimate development of **Augustine** or Trent as a merely disciplinary council. Those claims must be carefully qualified by noting that while Trent appeals to Augustine on grace and original sin, it decisively rejects Augustinian monergism as read by the Reformers. Likewise, one must not speak of Trent as another faithful expression of catholicity alongside the Reformation without distinguishing between shared **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** orthodoxy and fundamental soteriological divergence. Another danger is to echo modern ecumenical formulas that speak of justification as a non‑church‑dividing issue; in a Westminster setting, you must insist that Trent’s canons on justification expressly anathematize the Reformation doctrine that our standards teach.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the idea that Trent invented Roman Catholic distinctives out of thin air, or that it represents a total break with the medieval church. A more accurate account, which you should voice, is that Trent codified and sharpened existing medieval developments, such as the penitential system and Eucharistic doctrine, and hardened them against reform. Another misunderstanding is that Vatican II overturned Trent; you should instead say that **Vatican II** reinterpreted Trent pastorally and liturgically but left its dogmatic decrees in force. Finally, some students caricature Trent as utterly unconcerned with reform, which allows examiners to press them with the council’s real efforts to regulate clergy and bishops; you should acknowledge those reforms while arguing that the deeper doctrinal issues identified by **Luther** and **Calvin** remained entirely unresolved.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster and Reformed standpoint, the Council of Trent must be seen as a watershed in which the Roman church dogmatically entrenched its rejection of **sola Scriptura** and **sola fide**, bound the conscience to an expanded canon and to unwritten traditions, and identified saving grace with a sacramental and hierarchical system centered on Rome, thereby corrupting the doctrine of justification and the sufficiency of Christ’s once‑for‑all sacrifice. We can affirm with gratitude Trent’s maintenance of **Trinitarian** and **Christological** orthodoxy, its insistence that grace truly renews the believer, and its concern for ordered ministry and serious doctrinal definition, yet we must categorically deny its synergistic view of grace, its denial of imputed righteousness, its doctrines of the mass as propitiatory sacrifice and of transubstantiation, and its elevation of the magisterium as the infallible interpreter of revelation. If pressed to land the plane, the Reformed answer is that Trent placed itself under the apostolic anathema of **Galatians 1** by adding human works and ecclesiastical structures as co‑causes in salvation, so that while individual Roman Catholics may truly trust in Christ, the Tridentine system as such stands under the judgment of the gospel that justification is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ alone, on the basis of Scripture alone, to the glory of God alone.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- The **Council of Trent** from 1545 to 1563 is the decisive Roman Counter‑Reformation council that codified Catholic doctrine and discipline against the **Protestant Reformation**, especially on Scripture, justification, and the sacraments.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- **Trent** met in three main phases between **1545 and 1563** under popes **Paul III**, **Julius III**, and **Pius IV** in the imperial city of Trent and briefly Bologna.
- Key doctrinal products are the **Decree on Scripture and Tradition** (Session 4, 1546), the **Decree on Justification** (Session 6, 1547), and the **Decree on the Sacraments** and Eucharist (Sessions 7, 13, 22, 1547–1551).
- Its canons and anathemas became the doctrinal backbone of **Tridentine Catholicism** and were later reaffirmed by **Vatican I** and interpreted by **Vatican II**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Trent understands divine **revelation** as one Gospel transmitted in two modes, **Scripture and tradition**, both to be received with equal reverence and authoritatively interpreted by the magisterial **church**.
- It uses a **scholastic** method that deploys reason in service of faith, producing precise canons and anathemas while subordinating private judgment to the council and the **Roman pontiff**.
- History and experience are read through the lens of the continuous **Roman tradition**, so that the council sees itself as clarifying rather than innovating the deposit of faith.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- The **Decree on Scripture and Tradition** elevates unwritten **apostolic traditions** alongside Scripture and confirms the **Vulgate** and the deuterocanonical books as canonical.
- The **Decree on Justification** rejects **sola fide**, defines justification as both remission of sins and inner renewal by **habitual grace**, and insists on human cooperation and merit.
- The sacramental decrees define seven **sacraments**, teach baptismal regeneration and *ex opere operato* efficacy, and anathematize the denial that sacraments confer the grace they signify.
- On the **Eucharist**, Trent teaches **transubstantiation** and the mass as a **propitiatory sacrifice** offered for the living and the dead, directly opposing Reformed views.
- Trent denies Protestant **assurance** of salvation, treating confident certainty as presumption and reinforcing the **penitential system** with sacramental confession and satisfaction.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press Trent’s rejection of **sola Scriptura** through its elevation of tradition and the **magisterium**, and its expanded biblical canon.
- They will challenge Trent’s denial of **imputed righteousness** and **faith alone**, insisting that its Decree on Justification contradicts the Reformed gospel.
- Trent’s doctrines of **transubstantiation** and the mass as ongoing propitiatory sacrifice conflict with the once‑for‑all atonement of **Christ** in Hebrews and Reformed sacraments.
- The council’s denial of robust **assurance** and its synergistic view of **grace and free will** will be critiqued as pastorally destructive and theologically semi‑Pelagian.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Trent vs Luther** on justification by faith alone, assurance, and the bondage of the will.
- **Trent vs Calvin** on Scripture and tradition, the nature of the church, and the sacraments, especially the Lord’s Supper.
- **Augustine vs Trent** on grace and predestination as mediated through the Reformation versus Roman Catholic readings.
- **Trent vs Westminster Confession** on the doctrine of Scripture, justification, and the number and nature of the **sacraments**.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- The **Council of Trent** preserved catholic orthodoxy on the **Trinity** and **Christ**, but by dogmatically rejecting sola Scriptura and sola fide and sacramentalizing grace and church, it entrenched a system that the Reformed must regard as a profound deviation from the apostolic gospel.
