### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
John C. Peckham emerges within the twenty-first-century nexus of **evangelical theology**, **Adventist doctrinal retrieval**, and **analytic philosophy of religion**, serving at Andrews University in a context shaped by the Adventist **Great Controversy** motif and a broad evangelical commitment to **biblical authority**. His work positions itself against both **process theism** and **open theism**, while critically revising facets of **classical theism** where he judges the tradition insufficiently aligned with **Scripture’s final form**. The signature of his program is a **canonical model** of theology, in which the **biblical canon** is read as God’s authoritative communicative act that norms doctrine. The method is avowedly **sola and tota Scriptura**, yet conversant with **analytic argument** and the tools of **theological interpretation**. Philosophy is assigned a ministerial role in service of exegesis, never a magisterial role that would predetermine doctrinal outcomes. This setting places Peckham in lively conversations with **Aquinas on divine simplicity**, **Augustine on love and providence**, **Reformed scholasticism** on attributes, and contemporary figures such as **Vanhoozer** on divine discourse and **Plantinga** on the problem of evil. The intellectual aim is a biblical-theological recasting of **divine love** and **divine attributes** that is canonically thick, philosophically careful, and ecclesially useful.

#### 2. The canonical model and epistemic posture
Peckham’s **Canonical Theology: The Biblical Canon, Sola Scriptura, and Theological Method** 2016 lays out his methodological core. The **canonical model** privileges the canon’s final literary form as the primary site where God’s **self-communication** constrains doctrinal construction. The model operationalizes **sola Scriptura** by insisting on **tota Scriptura** and a sustained attention to canonical intratextuality, allowing Scripture to interpret Scripture along a rule-governed path. Tradition is treated as a **ministerial authority** under the canon, never a co-norming partner. Philosophy is welcomed as **ancilla theologiae** in a chastened sense, pressed into service to clarify conceptual entailments while refusing to settle questions that the canon leaves underdetermined. In this frame, theological predication is controlled by the canon’s patterns of divine naming, with **analogy** grounded more in biblical usage than in a developed **analogia entis**. Peckham draws on **theological interpretation of Scripture** and on **Vanhoozer’s** communicative-canonical insights, yet he pushes further by claiming that the canon’s discourse establishes the regulative contour of doctrinal ontology. The result is a posture that receives **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** only insofar as those doctrines can be articulated in a canonically governed idiom that protects both **God’s aseity** and **God’s relational agency** in covenant.

#### 3. The love of God and the shape of covenantal theism
In **The Love of God: A Canonical Model** 2015, Peckham develops a thick account of **divine love** as volitional, evaluative, emotional, and relational, refusing to reduce love to either sheer beneficence or mere sentiment. The canon’s witness yields a twofold thesis. First, God’s love is universal and initiatory, directed toward creatures in free benevolence and grounded in **God’s aseity** rather than in creaturely worth. Second, God’s love is covenantal and reciprocal, structured by **covenantal promises** and **moral conditions** that specify the form of communion. Peckham distinguishes **unconditional beneficence** from **conditional covenant fellowship**, arguing that while God indiscriminately wills the good of all, deeper communion is covenantally conditioned by faith and fidelity. Against **unilateralist determinism**, he contends that the canon depicts God as seeking uncoerced love that entails real creaturely response, and thus a world with genuine **libertarian freedom**. He resists a purely impassive deity by showing how the canon attributes pathos to God while safeguarding **divine holiness** and **immutability of character**. The upshot is a **covenantal theism** that treats love as the architectonic attribute by which the rest of the divine perfections are construed in their biblical proportions.

#### 4. Providence and evil within a cosmic conflict narrative
Peckham’s **Theodicy of Love: Cosmic Conflict and the Problem of Evil** 2018 situates the problem of evil within the canon’s **cosmic conflict** between God and satanic powers, a theme integral to the Adventist **Great Controversy** motif and resonant with broader evangelical deliverance themes. The governing claim is that **divine love**, as the canonical centrum, is intrinsically **noncoercive** and therefore **risk-allowing**. God voluntarily creates and covenants for a world in which moral agents possess **significant freedom**, the misuse of which explains moral evil and allows the outworking of natural evil within a fallen order contested by personal evil powers. Unlike **open theism**, Peckham insists on **exhaustive divine foreknowledge**, yet denies **meticulous determinism**, arguing that foreknowledge does not entail foreordination of every event. He engages **Plantinga’s** free will defense, revises **greater-good** accounts by tying goods to covenantal love rather than abstract value, and critiques theodical strategies that dissolve biblical depictions of divine grief and patience into impassive metaphysics. The cross functions climactically as the locus of God’s **justice and mercy**, displaying holy love that permits evil for a time, defeats evil eschatologically, and vindicates God’s goodness before creatures within the **canonical eschatology**.

#### 5. Attributes reconceived by Scripture’s grammar
In **Divine Attributes: Knowing the Covenantal God of Scripture** 2021, Peckham argues that the canon warrants a set of rearticulated perfections that preserve **aseity** and **sovereignty** while refusing metaphysical constructions that would evacuate divine relationality. He critiques **strong divine simplicity** as bordering on identity of attributes with essence in a way that collapses God’s **triune life** into undifferentiated unity, proposing a **qualified simplicity** that protects divine unity without negating real personal distinctions and rich predication. **Immutability** is affirmed as **covenantal immutability** across God’s moral character and promises, while rejecting a model that precludes relational responsiveness and temporal action ad extra. **Impassibility** is rendered as **qualified impassibility** or **impassibility of nature with freely willed passibility**, affirming that God is not passively conditioned by creation yet truly suffers by covenantal choice, supremely in the **incarnation and cross**. **Omniscience** is comprehensive and includes knowledge of creaturely choices, but does not cash out in **Molinist middle knowledge** that is seen as philosophically heavy and canonically underdetermined. **Omnipotence** is unqualified with respect to power yet covenantally self-bound as to mode, since God keeps promises that shape providential action. The canon thus yields a **covenantal theism** that navigates between **classical theism** and **open theism**.

#### 6. Canon, church, and the rule of faith
Peckham’s method makes careful use of the **regula fidei** while insisting that the rule must be generated and constantly corrected by the **biblical canon** itself. The church’s creedal heritage is a secondary authority that may guide but never govern exegesis. Peckham’s disciplinary posture is in conversation with **John Webster** on the primacy of revelation in theological reasoning and with **Kevin Vanhoozer** on canonical-linguistic performance, yet he adds a stronger insistence that intratextual patterns reign over metaphysical perfection-logic. He therefore treats historical doctrines like **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** as corrigible in their classical formulations, contending that their biblical truth-content must be reframed to avoid silencing texts that ascribe responsive love, patience, and grief to God. This entails a hermeneutic that gives canonical priority to **covenantal predicates** and to the history of **divine action** in Israel and Jesus Christ. The effect is a theological method that is confessional in spirit toward Scripture, ecumenically alert to tradition, and resistant to both **metaphysical rationalism** that overrules exegesis and to **historicist biblicism** that ignores doctrinal synthesis.

#### 7. Interlocutors and differentiations across the spectrum
Peckham’s work proceeds through rigorous engagement with historical and contemporary figures. With **Aquinas**, he shares a commitment to **aseity** and **perfect being** reasoning, yet he resists the strong form of **actus purus** when it implies a denial of relational dynamism ad extra, aligning instead with a **biblical ontology of covenantal faithfulness**. Against **open theism** represented by figures like **Clark Pinnock**, he insists on **exhaustive divine foreknowledge** and the stability of **prophecy** and **eschatology**, while retaining **libertarian freedom** and the non-coercive grammar of love. In dialogue with **Molinism** as articulated by **Luis de Molina** and by contemporary defenders such as **William Lane Craig**, he questions whether **middle knowledge** is necessary or canonically grounded, preferring to leave the mode of foreknowledge unreified while maintaining its exhaustiveness. Against hard **Reformed determinism**, often represented by **Paul Helm** in analytic form and by **Reformed scholasticism** historically, he denies that **meticulous providence** is compatible with the canon’s depiction of real options and genuine divine grief. And with recent defenders of **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** such as **James Dolezal**, he agrees on safeguarding Creator-creature distinction and **divine independence**, yet contends that biblical discourse requires a **qualified model** that accounts for God’s responsive covenantal life.

#### 8. Integrative synthesis and constructive payoff
The constructive payoff of Peckham’s project is an integrated **covenantal theism** that sets **divine love** as architectonic while avoiding reductionism. By treating the canon’s storyline and predicates as governing norms, he crafts a model in which God’s **immutability** is moral and promissory, God’s **impassibility** is the sovereign freedom not to be overcome yet the free willingness to suffer for covenant, and God’s **providence** is meticulous in wisdom but not deterministic in cause. The **cosmic conflict** metanarrative situates evil, angelology, and eschatology within the church’s proclamation, giving pastoral traction to doctrines often abstracted in metaphysical debate. The virtue of the method is its refusal to allow a philosophical perfection to negate a biblical narrative or name. The result is a taxonomy of attributes and a providential logic that many evangelicals perceive as charting a middle course between **classical theism** and **open theism**, recovering much of the former’s transcendence while appropriating the latter’s insistence on reciprocal relationality, yet grounding both in **Scripture’s own terms** rather than in alien metaphysical systems.

#### 9. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Peckham’s strengths are clear. His rigorous **sola and tota Scriptura**, his resistance to **process theism** and denial of any divine dependency, and his insistence on **aseity**, **triune sovereignty**, and **exhaustive foreknowledge** all resonate with confessional instincts. Yet substantial tensions arise at key points. The **Westminster Confession of Faith 2.1** affirms God as **without body, parts, or passions**, enshrining **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** in their classical senses, along with a robust doctrine of **eternal decree** that grounds a **compatibilist** account of freedom and **meticulous providence**. Peckham’s **qualified simplicity**, **covenantal immutability**, and **qualified impassibility** revise this grammar by tethering the perfections more closely to biblical depictions of temporal responsiveness and covenantal reciprocity. The Reformed concern is that such revisions risk diluting the **Creator-creature distinction** and the doctrine of **actus purus**, threatening analogical predication by reading anthropomorphic idioms too univocally. Likewise his **risk-allowing providence** and **libertarian freedom** stand in principled conflict with **Calvin’s autotheos**, **Turretin’s** account of decree and concurrence, and **compatibilist moral agency**, challenging the confessional coherence of **providence**, **predestination**, and **assurance**. A classical Reformed alternative would maintain the canon’s relational idioms while interpreting them through the **rule of analogy**, preserving **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** as perfections of God’s simple being, and construing evil under **concursus** and **secondary causes** within a good and wise decree. Still, Peckham’s canonical insistence usefully admonishes Reformed theology to ensure that metaphysical grammar remains the servant of **biblical revelation**, not its silent rival.
