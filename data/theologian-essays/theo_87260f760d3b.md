### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Hunter Baker emerges as a contemporary **evangelical public theologian** whose enduring claim is that **secularism is not neutral** and therefore should not monopolize the rules of public engagement. Trained in **law** and **political science**, and serving in Christian liberal arts settings such as **Union University**, he writes within the late twentieth and early twenty-first century American context in which the **First Amendment** is renegotiated amid **culture wars**. His formation situates him at the crossroads of **jurisprudence**, **political theory**, and **doctrinal theology**, a posture that aligns him with **R. J. Neuhaus** on the naked public square and with **Abraham Kuyper** on **sphere sovereignty**. Baker self-consciously adopts **Augustinian realism**, invoking the *saeculum* to temper political utopianism with **original sin**, while simultaneously affirming **imago Dei** dignity as the ground for **religious liberty**. Methodologically he uses **lex naturalis**, natural law, and **common grace** as shared lights for citizens, coupled with a **public reason accessibility** norm rather than a **Rawlsian acceptability** test that would domesticate theological speech. The resulting method is interdisciplinary and prudential, crafted for adjudicating concrete controversies in **law**, **policy**, and the **civil society** that mediates between persons and the state.

Baker writes against the background of aggressive **secularization** claims and the **New Atheism**, yet he denies both the inevitability and the neutrality of secular settlement. He insists that the United States inherits a double commitment to **non-establishment** and **free exercise**, which together encourage **principled pluralism** rather than a censoring regime. He is shaped by **Augustine’s City of God**, **Niebuhr’s Christian realism**, and the jurisprudential aftermath of **Employment Division v. Smith, 1990**, which lowered protections for free exercise, and of **RFRA, 1993**, which sought to restore strict scrutiny to burdens on religion. His method consistently integrates **anthropology**, **law**, and **ethics** to argue that political order is a moral enterprise, not a value-free machine.

#### 2. The End of Secularism, 2009
Baker’s signature contribution appears in **The End of Secularism, 2009**, where he argues that official secularism functions as a substantive, and therefore oppressive, **comprehensive doctrine** masquerading as procedural neutrality. He contends that **liberal neutrality** is a myth that hides contestable moral judgments about the human good, power, and ultimate ends. Influenced by **Neuhaus** and in conversation with **John Rawls**, he contends that the United States constitutional tradition permits, and even invites, citizens to reason from thick moral sources including **religion**. He names the core misstep of secularism as the attempted expulsion of **transcendent reasons** from the **public square**, which in effect enthrones a rival orthodoxy and marginalizes **imago Dei**-based moral speech.

Against this deprivation, **The End of Secularism** proposes a better settlement: publicly available reasoning animated by **natural law** and **principled pluralism**, where **religious liberty** is treated as a **first freedom** that shelters an ecosystem of **mediating institutions**. Baker’s Augustinian accents appear in warnings about **libido dominandi**, the lust to dominate, which can animate secular elites as surely as religious majorities. He uses the **First Amendment** structure to secure an open contest of moral visions, arguing that coercion should be limited by **strict scrutiny** and that the government’s aims must be pursued by the least restrictive means. The book thus bridges **jurisprudence** and **public theology**, rejecting both the **naked public square** and religious establishment.

#### 3. Political Thought: A Student’s Guide, 2012
In **Political Thought: A Student’s Guide, 2012**, Baker serves the evangelical academy by rehearsing the canon of **political philosophy** under a normative Christian horizon. He introduces **Aristotle** on the polis and **telos**, **Augustine** on the two cities, **Aquinas** on **lex naturalis**, **Calvin** on **magistracy**, **Hobbes** and **Locke** on sovereignty and rights, and **Madison** and **Tocqueville** on constitutionalism and **civil society**. This pedagogical project is not merely descriptive. Baker urges evangelical readers to recover a thick account of **virtue**, **ordered liberty**, and the importance of **mediating institutions** such as family, church, associations, and localities that distribute authority according to **sphere sovereignty** and subsidiarity.

The book also trains students to detect the moral freight of modern **liberalism**. Baker highlights **Rawls’s public reason** as a regulative ideal that threatens to privatize the **common good**, while noting **Habermas’s postsecular turn** that recognizes the continued vitality of religious speech. His constructive proposal remains consistent: a **public reason accessibility** standard that invites translation but does not require **self-secularization**. The text functions as an onramp to evangelical engagement in **political theory**, equipping readers to integrate **imago Dei**, **original sin**, and **common grace** into a realistic account of politics that avoids both cynicism and triumphalism.

#### 4. The System Has a Soul, 2014
In **The System Has a Soul, 2014**, a collection of essays on **Christianity**, **liberty**, and **political life**, Baker turns to concrete controversies in **American law and policy**. He narrates the meaning of **religious liberty** in a complex economy, analyzes the **HHS contraceptive mandate** disputes, and defends corporate free exercise in **Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, 2014**. The titular claim that the system has a soul is a way of asserting moral anthropology against reductionist technocracy. A legal system ordered to human flourishing must honor **conscience** as an aspect of **imago Dei** and therefore must not conscript citizens to participate in acts they deem morally impermissible unless the state satisfies a demanding **strict scrutiny** test.

These essays also critique **Employment Division v. Smith** for narrowing free exercise by subordinating religion to neutral, generally applicable laws. Baker argues, in line with **RFRA**, that neutrality in form can still mask substantive moral imposition. He defends robust carve-outs and **accommodations** as civic instruments of **principled pluralism**. The book ranges beyond law into **civic virtue**, **education**, and the moral ecology of **civil society**, where he again commends **mediating institutions** as buffers against both statism and atomistic individualism. The collection thereby extends the central thesis of **The End of Secularism** and supplies the prudential toolkit for implementation.

#### 5. Interlocutors and debates
Baker’s polemical interlocutors include **Rawls** and **Robert Audi**, who prescribe limits on **religious reasons** in public discourse, and **Habermas**, who partially repents of strict secularism by proposing translation and reciprocal learning in a **postsecular society**. Baker appreciates the opening but resists any rule that would render **theological language** civically improper. He leans on **Charles Taylor’s immanent frame** to diagnose how secular conditions privilege flattening accounts of reason, and he invokes **Alasdair MacIntyre** to underscore the traditioned character of rationality without collapsing into relativism. On the ecclesial side, he distances himself from **Stanley Hauerwas** when sectarianism appears to withdraw from constitutional responsibility, preferring a **Kuyperian** posture of public witness across differentiated **spheres**.

At the same time Baker is not a theocrat. He is closer to **Madisonian pluralism**, **Baptist soul freedom**, and **Augustine’s two cities** than to any confessional establishment. He refuses both **laïcité**, the French model of aggressive secular banishment, and civil religious fusion. He envisions a **procedural liberalism** reformed by **moral realism**, where the state protects spaces for thick communities to pursue goods under the rule of law. The debates that shape his work include **Obergefell v. Hodges, 2015**, the scope of **free exercise** versus **anti-discrimination** norms, and the nature of **public reason** in a fractured polity.

#### 6. Doctrinal underpinnings
Baker’s political theology rests on doctrines central to **evangelical orthodoxy**. The **doctrine of creation** supplies an ontological ground for political order as a penultimate good under divine **providence**. The **imago Dei** confers dignity, agency, and responsibility, anchoring claims about **conscience**, **religious liberty**, and the priority of **voluntary association**. The **doctrine of sin**, often expressed with Augustinian language of *homo incurvatus in se*, disciplines political hopes through realism about power, ideology, and institutional drift. This Augustinian frame conditions both his critique of **secularism** and his defense of distributed authority through **sphere sovereignty**.

In ethics Baker appeals to **natural law** as **lex naturalis**, a moral grammar accessible to all and illuminated, though not replaced, by special revelation. He avoids a purely confessional politics while insisting that **Scripture** shapes Christian political prudence. He sometimes synthesizes **common grace** with natural reason, arguing that God restrains evil and opens shared moral insight across communities, thereby enabling **principled pluralism**. Eschatologically he is wary of both constantinian triumphalism and apolitical quietism. He calls for **public discipleship** that is patient, persistent, and oriented to **ordered liberty** within the *saeculum*, while confessing that the **civitas Dei** is eschatologically decisive and cannot be collapsed into any earthly polity.

#### 7. Law, institutions, and civil society
Baker’s account of **law** is teleological and ecological. Law orders common life toward substantive goods rather than arbitrary preferences. He thus resists legal positivism that abstracts law from **morality**, and he resists libertarian minimalism that neglects the **common good**. Yet his **Augustinian realism** prevents him from making the state the tutor of virtue in every sphere. Hence the emphasis on **civil society**, **mediating institutions**, and **subsidiarity**. The family, church, school, business firm, and voluntary associations possess authentic authority coram Deo, before God, which the state should recognize and respect under **sphere sovereignty**. Religious institutions in particular require robust **autonomy** to fulfill their vocations without state reshaping of doctrine or morals.

This institutional vision funds Baker’s defense of **conscience protections** for individuals and organizations. He argues that plural institutional forms allow diverse citizens to live with integrity while cooperating across difference for civic peace. The policy corollaries include support for **school choice**, protections for **faith-based social services**, and strong **free exercise** rights balanced by narrow, genuinely compelling state interests. The ethos is neither sectarian withdrawal nor statist oversight, but a **plural moral ecology** of overlapping, mutually correcting authorities.

#### 8. Public reason and persuasion
Baker operationalizes his critique of **secularism** by proposing norms for **public reason** that are inclusive rather than censorious. He promotes an **accessibility** standard in which reasons can be offered in explicitly religious or philosophical registers so long as they are sincerely proposed for the **common good** and subjected to public scrutiny. He rejects interpretations of **Rawls’s proviso** that require translation of religious claims into allegedly neutral idioms, contending that translation often smuggles in the supremacy of **secular moral metaphysics**. He welcomes **Habermas’s postsecular** concession that modern publics remain religiously vital, yet he insists that the logic of mutual accountability does not demand the evacuation of **theological content**.

The rhetorical mode is persuasion through **civil argument**, patient listening, and principled candor. Baker envisions citizens formed by churches and schools who can inhabit **constitutional democracy** without privatizing their deepest convictions. He frequently cites **C. S. Lewis** on objective value and **moral knowledge**, contending that even late modern societies intuit real goods that can be named and defended. His public reason ideal thus presumes **moral realism**, **imago Dei** capacities for knowing, and **common grace** that makes shared politics possible among those who disagree about ultimate things.

#### 9. Influence, reception, and ongoing relevance
Baker’s work circulates in evangelical academic networks, notably through **Crossway’s Reclaiming the Christian Intellectual Tradition**, and in public-facing venues such as **First Things**, **Touchstone**, and policy institutes aligned with **religious liberty**. His thesis converges with legal scholars like **Steven D. Smith** on the disenchantment of secular discourse and with **Mary Ann Glendon** on rights talk, though his idiom remains evangelical and pedagogical. Among evangelicals, his case for **principled pluralism** resonates with **neo-Calvinist** traditions influenced by **Kuyper**, while Baptists find in his defense of **soul freedom** and **free exercise** a recognizable inheritance. His arguments have ongoing relevance in conflicts after **Obergefell, 2015**, **Masterpiece Cakeshop, 2018**, and evolving debates over **Title VII** and **public accommodations**.

Critics from the left accuse him of granting religious privilege and underestimating harms in discrimination law, while critics from the right sometimes press for more aggressively **confessional politics** than his **procedural liberalism** allows. Baker answers both by doubling down on **Augustinian realism** and on the double track of **non-establishment** and **free exercise**. He continues to defend **mediating institutions**, **plural authority**, and the moral agency of communities whose convictions cannot be reduced to state orthodoxy. In this sense he occupies a steady center within evangelical **political theology**, offering a practicable path for civic faithfulness in plural societies.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Baker’s project merits strong affirmation for its **Augustinian political realism**, its defense of **religious liberty as first freedom**, and its Kuyperian emphasis on **sphere sovereignty** and **mediating institutions**. He reads **original sin** and **imago Dei** with clarity and applies **common grace** with prudence. The main tension arises in his reliance on **natural law** and **public reason accessibility** as a primary bridge for common life. A **Van Tilian** account of **antithesis** warns that fallen reason is never religiously neutral and that appeals to shared moral grammar can mask deep covenantal divergence regarding **revelation**, **law**, and the **common good**. A Westminster alternative would insist that **Scripture as principium** remains the architectonic standard for political theology, with **natural law** deployed ministerially and critically rather than architectonically. Likewise, some Reformed two-kingdoms voices would urge sharper differentiation of **churchly means of grace** from **civil prudence**, cautioning against any sacral aura around the moral consensus of the **saeculum** and resisting drift toward **civil religion**. The most promising Reformed correction would be to marry Baker’s **principled pluralism** to a more explicit **covenantal epistemology**, clarifying that there is no metaphysically neutral ground, while still defending robust **legal protections** that preserve space for faithful obedience to Christ’s lordship in all **spheres**.
