### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and Context: Post-secular ressourcement
John Betz has emerged as a leading contemporary **Roman Catholic** theologian whose work orchestrates a disciplined retrieval of **Thomistic metaphysics** and **ressourcement** spirituality in the wake of late modernity’s epistemic fissures. His scholarly profile formed through close engagement with **continental philosophy**, especially **Kant**, **Hegel**, **Nietzsche**, and **Heidegger**, while drawing on the Catholic renewal signaled by **de Lubac** and **Balthasar**. In this matrix Betz positions the **analogia entis** as a grammar of Christian thought that honors **divine transcendence** and **creaturely participation**, while absorbing post-secular insights about the limits of autonomous reason. The early essay **Beyond the Sublime: The Aesthetics of the Analogy of Being** in 2005 signaled his interest in rehabilitating **beauty** against the late modern dominance of the **sublime**, a turn keyed to **Balthasar’s theological aesthetics** and **Przywara’s analogical ontology**. By 2009 his monograph **After Enlightenment: The Post-Secular Vision of J. G. Hamann** framed an alternative to Enlightenment rationalism grounded in the **incarnational logic of language**, prefiguring his mature defense of **analogy** as both metaphysical and Christological.

#### 2. Method: Analogical metaphysics with apophatic reserve
Betz’s method is best described as **ressourcement Thomism** under the sign of **Przywara’s unity-in-tension**, operating with **apophatic discipline** and a robust account of **participation**. He reads **Aquinas’s actus essendi** through **Przywara’s** signature polarity of **essence and esse** to articulate a rhythmic account of finite being: the creature exists as a contingent participation in **ipsum esse subsistens**, marked by a perpetual **in-and-beyond** relation to **God**. The **Lateran IV** axiom, that any similarity between Creator and creature entails a greater dissimilarity, governs the metaphysical horizon so that **analogia entis** prevents univocity and forestalls equivocity. Betz integrates this ontology with attention to **language** and **phenomenology**, insisting that analogical predication is not a speculative ladder but the humble grammar of confessing **divine simplicity** and **aseity** while preserving the integrity of **creaturely finitude**. His apophatic emphasis retrieves **Dionysian** themes, aligning with **Balthasar’s** Christic form of revelation while still defending the metaphysical intelligibility of created being under **creatio ex nihilo**.

#### 3. Key Works: Hamann and the Post-Secular Turn
In **After Enlightenment** 2009 Betz reconstructs **J. G. Hamann** as a prophetic critic of the Enlightenment’s autonomous reason, showing how **faith**, **language**, and **incarnation** reframe knowledge. Hamann’s biblically charged anti-idealism becomes a resource for questioning both **Kantian** critique and **Hegelian** system, allowing Betz to propose a post-secular reconfiguration in which **revelation** restores the givenness of the world and the creature’s dependence on **God**. The book thereby thematizes a theological account of **language** against **skepticism** and **nihilism**, disclosing the lineaments of an analogical metaphysics alive to **paradox**, **poetry**, and **sacramentality**. Hamann’s stress on the historical **Christ** and the logic of the **cross** enables Betz to link **epistemology** and **soteriology**, advancing a framework where **analogia entis** is not a remnant of natural theology but a disciplined way of speaking that conforms to the grain of **divine condescension**. Thus the Hamann project prepares Betz’s broader defense of **analogy** as the only adequate grammar for simultaneously confessing **transcendence** and the real **knowability of God**.

#### 4. Major Retrieval: Przywara’s Analogia Entis
Betz’s most consequential contribution is his translation and extensive introduction to **Erich Przywara’s Analogia Entis** in 2014, co-produced with the philosopher **David Bentley Hart**, which made accessible one of the twentieth century’s densest accounts of **analogy**. In this work Betz explicates **Przywara’s unity-in-tension** as the fundamental **creaturely rhythm**: the finite participates in the infinite while ever receding in **dissimilarity**, a structure anchored in the **real distinction** and in **creatio ex nihilo**. He argues that **analogia entis** is not a compromise with **univocity** but its principled negation, and not a capitulation to **equivocity** but its overcoming through **analogical proportion**. Betz defends **Przywara** against **Karl Barth’s** notorious charge that the **analogia entis** is the invention of the **Antichrist**, contending that Barth misread **Cajetan** and overlooked **Lateran IV** as well as the apophatic cadence of **Aquinas**. For Betz, the **analogia entis** is a metaphysical codex of **divine transcendence**, a theological reconstrual of **metaphysics** that receives rather than constructs, and a precondition for rightly hearing the **Word of God** without collapsing creator and creature.

#### 5. Analogia entis, Christology, and Aesthetics
Betz does not leave **analogy** at the level of first philosophy; he Christologizes it in conversation with **Balthasar’s** account of the **form of Christ**. He presses the claim that the **Logos** is the archetype of creaturely **intelligibility**, so that the **analogia entis** is radicated in the **incarnation** and ordered to **theo-drama** and **theo-logic**. The aesthetic dimension of theology, foregrounded in the 2005 essay **Beyond the Sublime**, becomes a field-test for analogy: the modern dominance of the **sublime** disrupts **form** and tempts toward formless transcendence, whereas **beauty** as **splendor formae** renders the unity of **truth**, **goodness**, and **glory** visible. In this optic the analogical proportion of being grounds a contemplative openness to **revelation** and shapes a liturgical reception of **grace**. Betz thereby links **metaphysics**, **Christology**, and **aesthetics** in a single movement that resists both **immanentism** and **voluntarism**, framing **divine simplicity** and **trinitarian processions** within the radiance of the incarnate **Son**.

#### 6. Nature and Grace: De Lubac read with Przywara
A recurring axis in Betz’s corpus is the **nature and grace** debate that haunted twentieth-century **Catholic theology**. Reading **Henri de Lubac** together with **Przywara**, Betz rejects an extrinsicist **natura pura** as a self-enclosed teleology while keeping a strict account of **gratuitous elevation**. He recovers the **desiderium naturale** for the **beatific vision** as an analogical tendency rather than a claim of innate possession, thereby honoring **grace’s gratuity** while avoiding the dualism of two parallel ends. The **essence-esse** tension renders finite nature inherently open to God yet never proportional to the **supernatural end**; the **dissimilitudo maior** secures the gap that only **grace** bridges. Betz’s constructive upshot is a metaphysically chastened **integralism** that defends **participation** without collapsing **nature** into **grace**. In this, he both deepens **Aquinas** against **Scotist univocity** and shows how **Przywara’s** analogical ontology might be a theological antidote to **secularization**, since only a participatory account sustains a coherent vision of **creation** and **beatitude**.

#### 7. Interlocutors: Barth, Heidegger, and Radical Orthodoxy
Betz’s polemical energy often gathers around **Karl Barth**, whose **analogia fidei** he regards as mistaking the metaphysical preconditions of confession for a rival epistemic principle. He argues that rightly construed **analogia entis** and **analogia fidei** complement one another: the first concerns the ontological proportion between **Creator** and **creature**, the second the hermeneutical posture of faith before **Scripture**. Against **Heidegger’s** charge of **onto-theology**, Betz marshals **Przywara** to show that analogy safeguards the otherness of **God** as **ipsum esse**, who can never be mastered conceptually, while defending the positive predication required by **dogma**. With **Radical Orthodoxy**, especially **John Milbank**, Betz shares a critique of **univocity** and **secular reason**, but he favors a more explicit **Thomistic** and **apophatic** discipline and resists ecclesiocentric short-circuits that blur **nature** and **grace**. This trio of interlocutors frames his distinctive stance: he answers **Barth** with **Lateran IV**, **Heidegger** with **participation**, and **modernity** with **Hamann’s** cruciform wisdom of **language**.

#### 8. Divine Names, Simplicity, and Theological Discourse
Beyond headline debates, Betz contributes to reflection on the **divine names**, **divine simplicity**, and the shape of **theological language**. He stresses that analogical predication follows the **via affirmationis, via negationis, via eminentiae**, allowing confession of **divine perfections** while intensifying **apophatic** reverence. He defends **simplicity** not as abstract monism but as the fullness of **act**, correlating it with **trinitarian processions** and **missions**. Here Betz’s sensitivity to **language** reflects the legacy of **Hamann**; theological speech must be chaste, poetic, and obedient to **revelation**, even as it recognizes the prior metaphysical **participation** that renders discourse possible. Against modern theories of reference that either literalize or dissolve God-talk, he advances an analogical semantics steeped in **Aquinas** and **Przywara**, one that preserves **mystery** and makes room for doctrinal precision in **Christology** and **Trinity**. Such work threads together **metaphysics** and **biblical confession**, seeking a unity proper to a Catholic **sacramental ontology**.

#### 9. Aesthetics and Culture: Beyond the Sublime
Betz’s retrieval is also cultural criticism, diagnosing the spiritual shape of modern **aesthetics**. The rule of the **sublime** in post-Kantian thought represents a flight from **form** and a fascination with sheer magnitude or shock, producing a theology of absent **beauty**. In answer, Betz proposes the **analogia entis** as the grammar for perceiving **form** in created things as vestigia of the **Logos**, a discipline of perception that both chastens and elevates taste. By rejoining **beauty**, **truth**, and **goodness**, he aligns **aesthetics** with **sanctification**, while refusing the sentimentalism that modern critiques rightly fear. This cultural turn complements his metaphysics: only a participatory **creation** ordered by **glory** can sustain the practices of **contemplation**, **liturgy**, and **mission**. The aesthetic argument thus becomes practical ecclesiology, a vision of how **grace** transfigures **nature** without destroying it, and how **divine glory** is analogically manifest in the saints, sacraments, and the enacted **theo-drama**.

#### 10. Contribution and Reformed Evaluation
Betz’s enduring contribution is a disciplined retrieval of **analogia entis** as a Catholic grammar of **transcendence**, specified **Christologically**, tested aesthetically, and defended against **Barthian** and **Heideggerian** objections. He offers a metaphysics that seeks to serve **dogmatics**, rather than the reverse, and a post-secular stance that receives wisdom from **Hamann** to resist both rationalist and voluntarist distortions. For a **Reformed** and **WTS** evaluation, the central tension concerns whether **analogia entis** functions as a necessary prolegomenon or an unnecessary metaphysical surcharge on the **principium** of revelation. Classical Reformed theology welcomes Betz’s defense of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **creatio ex nihilo**, and his rejection of **univocity**. It also resonates with his use of **Lateran IV’s dissimilitudo maior**, his anti-idealism via **Hamann**, and his critique of the modern **sublime**. Yet Reformed dogmatics would reconfigure the same concerns covenantally: the ontology of **participation** becomes an ontology of **covenant**, the epistemic path is **analogia fidei** grounded in the **self-attesting Scripture** and the **Spirit’s internal testimony**, and the natural desire for **beatitude** yields to the **sensus divinitatis** and the teleology of **union with Christ**. On **nature and grace**, sympathy for resisting extrinsicism remains, but a Reformed alternative would avoid the **desiderium naturale** language and insist that all true knowledge of God is redemptively situated within the **covenant of grace**. In short, Betz’s analogical retrieval can be gratefully mined for its classical theism and anti-univocal rigor, yet it requires covenantal recalibration to avoid granting **metaphysics** a normative place that, in Reformed terms, belongs to **revelation**, **covenant**, and **Christ’s mediatorial lordship**.
