### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the rise of a Dominican master
Born at Roccasecca in 1224 or 1225, **Thomas Aquinas** matured amid the institutional consolidation of the **medieval universities** and the mendicant turn of **Dominican** preaching and study. His early education at **Monte Cassino** placed him within Augustinian monastic learning, while his studies at **Naples** exposed him to newly translated **Aristotle** and to **Averroist** currents circulating through Italy. Entering the **Order of Preachers** in 1244 against his noble family’s wishes, he studied under **Albertus Magnus** in **Paris** and **Cologne**, absorbing a method that could receive **Aristotelian metaphysics** without surrendering **Christian dogma**. Appointed **magister** at Paris in 1256, he battled **Latin Averroism** and clarified the Christian claims about **creation**, **immortality**, and **providence**. His Roman and Neapolitan periods 1265–1273 saw the composition of the **Summa theologiae** and the **Commentaries on Aristotle**, alongside pastoral works like the **Catena aurea**. After a Eucharistic vision on 6 December 1273, he ceased writing, dying en route to the **Council of Lyons** in 1274. Posthumously branded by some articles swept into the **1277 Condemnations**, he was canonized in 1323 and later hailed by **Leo XIII’s Aeterni Patris** as the **Doctor communis** for recovering the unity of **faith and reason** under **divine simplicity**.

#### 2. Sacra doctrina as a unified science under revelation
Aquinas frames theology in the **Summa theologiae I.1** as **sacra doctrina**, a **scientia subalternata** whose first principles come from **revelation** and whose certitude surpasses other sciences because its principle is **God’s knowledge**. The subject is **God and all things under the aspect of God**, so the material is comprehensive while the formal ratio unifies it in **ordo ad Deum**. The method deploys **argument from authority** for those articles grounded in **Scripture** and **tradition**, while employing **philosophical arguments** where **reason** can serve the **preambula fidei**. Two lights govern the process: the **lumen naturale** of reason and the **lumen fidei** of grace, which do not compete because **truth is one** in the **First Truth**. Aquinas’s dialectic of **via negativa**, **via eminentiae**, and **via causalitatis** controls divine discourse, while **analogia nominum** avoids both univocity and pure equivocity in predicating **goodness**, **wisdom**, and **being** of **God** and creatures. The motto that **gratia non tollit naturam sed perficit** expresses his metaphysical and epistemic posture: the order of **nature** is real and intelligible, and **grace** elevates it to a supernatural **beatitude** that reason desires but cannot attain without **revelation**.

#### 3. Metaphysical architecture: esse, simplicity, and the Five Ways
In the early **De ente et essentia**, Aquinas crystallizes his metaphysic of **act and potency**, distinguishing **essentia** from **esse** in creatures and locating in God the identity of **essence and existence** as **ipsum esse subsistens**. This grounds **divine simplicity**: God is not composite, not in a genus, without accidents, pure **actus purus**. The unity of God entails **immutability**, **impassibility**, **eternity**, and **omnipresence**, while divine attributes are really identical with the divine essence and diversely known by us. The **Five Ways** in **ST I.2** are not a single cosmological proof but five modes from **motion**, **efficient causality**, **contingency**, **gradation**, and **final causality** to the necessary, most actual, most good, and intelligent cause we call **God**. The logic presupposes **hylomorphism**, **final causality**, and **participation**: created being is a participated **esse** that images the source as an **exemplar**. Naming God is governed by **analogy** because our concepts arise from creaturely perfections, which pre-exist in God in a higher mode through **via eminentiae** and are denied of God in their creaturely limitations through the **via negativa**. Thus **divine names** like wise or good are predicated analogically, safeguarding **transcendence** while enabling **true knowledge**.

#### 4. Trinity, processions, and missions
Aquinas’s trinitarian doctrine unfolds the **processions** of **Word** and **Love** within the one **simple essence**, grounding **relations of opposition** that are **subsistent** and constitute the **Persons**. The **Father** as principium non de principio spirates with the **Son** the **Holy Spirit**, affirming the **Filioque** on the basis of **one spiration**, distinct only by relation. The **notional acts** are eternal, while **missions** are temporal sendings of the **Son** and **Spirit** according to the **order of grace**, rooting ecclesial and sacramental life in **trinitarian economy**. The **divine ideas** establish exemplar causality for creatures and a doctrine of **predestination** wherein the rational creature’s end is **beatific vision**, decreed from eternity in **simple intelligence**. Divine **providence** orders all things to the **good**, employing **secondary causes** without competition, so that causal integrity is maintained and contingency secured in the mode of **created causes**. **Evil** is not a positive entity but a **privation** of due good, parasitic upon the **metaphysical goodness** of being, which protects **divine goodness** from being the cause of moral evil while preserving the universality of **divine causality**.

#### 5. Creation, anthropology, and knowledge
For Aquinas, **creation ex nihilo** is a relation of dependence of all **esse** on the **First Cause**, compatible with philosophical arguments for the world’s **contingency** though not its **temporal beginning**, which he holds by **faith**. Human nature is a **hylomorphic unity** with the **intellective soul** as **forma corporis**, uniquely subsistent and immortal. The **intellect** knows by **abstraction** through **agent intellect** from phantasms, rejecting a separate **Averroist** intellect and moderating **Augustinian illumination** by affirming the sufficiency of natural cognitive powers under **divine concurrence**. The **imago Dei** resides principally in the **intellect and will** ordered to **God**, and secondarily in the **habitus** of **grace** and **glory**. Final **beatitudo** consists formally in the **visio Dei**, an intuitive grasp of **divine essence** granted by **lumen gloriae**, with concomitant love and joy. This places the metaphysics of **participation** and the epistemology of **analogy** inside a teleology where nature’s restless desire finds its term only in **supernatural elevation**.

#### 6. Law, virtue, and the common good
The moral core of the **Summa theologiae** II–II is governed by **virtue** and **law**. The **lex aeterna** is the ratio of divine wisdom ordering all things, the **lex naturalis** is the rational creature’s participation in that order, the **lex humana** specifies it civilly, and the **lex nova** is the **law of the Spirit** as **grace and charity**. Against voluntarism, Aquinas situates **morality** in participation in the **eternal law** and the **common good**, elevated by **theological virtues** of **faith, hope, charity** and perfected by **gifts of the Spirit**. His **virtue ethics** synthesizes **Aristotle’s phronesis** and **Augustinian charity**, articulating a hierarchy of ends under **beatitude**. Political teaching in **De regno** and ST treats the **mixed regime**, **just war**, **property** ordered to the **common good** with permissive ownership and necessity-based use that can justify taking in **extreme need**. The result is a moral cosmology where **prudence**, **justice**, **fortitude**, and **temperance** are specified by **divine law** and perfected by **grace**, expressing the thesis that **gratia perficit naturam** within an ordered **polis**.

#### 7. Grace, justification, and predestination
The nature-grace relation structures Aquinas’s soteriology. **Grace** as **gratia gratum faciens** is an infused **habitus** that heals **nature’s wounds** and elevates it to **participation in the divine nature**. **Justification** involves a fourfold causality in **ST I–II.113**: the **final cause** is **God’s glory** and **human salvation**, the **efficient cause** is **God** moving the soul, the **meritorious cause** is **Christ’s passion**, and the **formal cause** is the infusion of **grace and charity**, remitting sin and renewing the interior person. **Faith** assents under **grace** but is not formed without **charity** for living righteousness. **Merit** is twofold, **de condigno** proportional to infused charity under **divine promise**, and **de congruo** fittingly rewarded. **Predestination** is a benevolent decree antecedent to any foreseen merits, while **reprobation** is permissive with respect to sin yet just in punishment, preserving both **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom** through **secondary causality**. The will is moved by God without violence according to the mode of the creature, an insight that underwrites Aquinas’s doctrine of **providence**, **prayer**, and the efficacy of **sacramental signs**.

#### 8. Christology and sacramental realism
Aquinas’s **Christology** elaborates the **hypostatic union** in which the **divine person** of the **Word** assumes a complete **human nature**, maintaining **one person in two natures** with **communicatio idiomatum** intact. Christ’s **knowledge** is triplex: **beatific**, **infused**, and acquired; his **will** is truly human and entirely obedient; his **passion** is a **satisfaction** of infinite worth because of the dignity of the **divine person**, effecting **atonement** and meriting grace for the elect. The **sacraments** are **instrumental causes** of grace, extensions of **Christ’s humanity** as the principal **instrument** united to the **divine Word**. **Baptism** regenerates, **penance** remits post-baptismal sin, **orders** conform ministers to Christ, and above all the **Eucharist** is the **real presence** by **transubstantiation**, in which the **substance** of bread and wine becomes the **body and blood** of Christ while the **accidents** remain. The sacraments work **ex opere operato** by Christ’s institution while requiring **dispositions** in the recipient for fruitful reception, an ontology of signs that rests on **hylomorphism**, **instrumentality**, and **analogy**. The pastoral works like the **Catena aurea** and the liturgical hymns for **Corpus Christi** display a theologian whose metaphysics yields a rich **sacramental ecclesiology**.

#### 9. Works, controversies, and legacy within Thomism
The two great syntheses, the **Summa contra Gentiles** and the **Summa theologiae**, differ in scope and audience: the **SCG** c. 1259–65 argues from **reason** toward faith and refutes **non-Christian philosophers**, while the **ST** 1265–73 is pedagogically ordered for beginners in **sacra pagina**, integrating **Scripture**, **Fathers**, and **philosophy** under the **articles** format. The **Quaestiones disputatae** and **Quodlibeta** show Aquinas at Paris in live scholastic disputation, treating **truth**, **power**, **evil**, **spiritual creatures**, and **the soul**. His **Aristotle commentaries** secured a Christian reading of the **Physics**, **Metaphysics**, **De anima**, and **Ethics** through **analogy** and **participation**. The **1260s Paris debates** with **Bonaventure** and later disputes with **Henry of Ghent** and **Siger of Brabant** sharpened his positions on **illumination**, the **unity of substantial form**, and the **separate intellect**. Though certain Thomist-proximate theses were entangled in the **1277 Condemnations**, later interpreters like **Cajetan** and **John of St Thomas** systematized **Thomism** in early modern scholasticism, while modern ressourcement retrieved his **biblical exegesis** and **sacramental theology**. Across centuries, Aquinas’s vision of **ipsum esse**, **analogy**, and **grace perfecting nature** furnished a durable grammar for Catholic dogmatics and a generative foil for **Reformed scholastic** engagements with **classical theism**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: principial contrasts and principled appropriations
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Aquinas’s **doctrine of God** commands deep respect for its articulation of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity**, the careful use of **primary and secondary causality**, and a principled **analogy** that guards **Creator-creature distinction**. Yet principial tensions emerge around the **nature-grace schema**, **epistemic principia**, **justification**, and **sacramental causality**. First, whereas Aquinas orders **lumen naturale** to **lumen fidei** within **sacra doctrina**, Reformed theology insists on **Scripture as principium unicum** and the **analogia fidei**, refusing any autonomous **preambula** as theologically neutral and re-situating **natural knowledge of God** within a **covenantal** frame marked by **sin’s noetic effects** and **general revelation** suppressed in **unbelief**. Second, the Thomist maxim **gratia perficit naturam** tends to a two-tier **teleology** in which **beatific elevation** supervenes upon a proportioned **natural end**, whereas Reformed federalism construes creation teleologically through the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, with no neutral **pure nature** but an originally eschatological **Sabbath** telos attained only in **Christ**. Third, Aquinas’s **justification** by infused **habitus** of **grace and charity**, coordinated with **merit de condigno** under **promise**, stands in material conflict with **sola fide** as **forensic imputation** of **Christ’s righteousness** received by **faith alone** apart from works, even while acknowledging Aquinas’s strong insistence on **grace’s primacy** and the **meritorious causality** of **Christ’s passion**. Fourth, the sacramental ontology of **ex opere operato** and **transubstantiation** diverges from a Reformed account of **Word and Spirit**, **sign and seal**, and the **spiritual presence** of Christ, though Aquinas’s instrumentality and attention to **institution** can be reframed within **covenantal signs**. Finally, his **analogia entis** as read in Thomism risks, in Reformed critique, attenuating the principled primacy of **revelation** by Scripture, even if Aquinas’s own **apophatic discipline** often undercuts that worry. In constructive appropriation, Reformed theology can receive Aquinas’s **classical theism**, **creation**, **providence**, and **virtue theory** purified by **redemptive-historical** and **federal** commitments, while maintaining **Calvin’s autotheos**, **law-gospel** distinction, and a doxological epistemology in which all knowledge of God is by **covenant**, through **Christ**, and unto **glory**.
