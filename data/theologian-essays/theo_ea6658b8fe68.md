### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation in a Van Tilian school and the forging of a method
John M. Frame, born in 1939, is a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose career unfolded across **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia, **Westminster Seminary California**, and **Reformed Theological Seminary** in Orlando. Trained at **Princeton** and **Yale** in philosophy and at **Westminster** under **Cornelius Van Til**, he matured precisely when postwar **evangelicalism** faced the twin challenges of modern critical theory and postmodern skepticism about truth. Frame absorbed **presuppositional apologetics** but sought to render it pastorally usable and philosophically clear. From the start his work combined analytic attention to argument with a deep commitment to Scripture as **principium cognoscendi** of theology, set within a covenantal **Reformed** orthodoxy. The early context of battles over **inerrancy**, the heritage of **J. Gresham Machen**, and the influence of **Van Til** formed the backdrop for a career-long project: to articulate a method and system ordered by **God’s lordship** and governed by a pattern of **multiperspectival** wisdom.

#### 2. Triperspectivalism and the lordship structure of knowledge
Frame’s signature contribution is **triperspectivalism**, a method that refracts every act of knowing and obeying God through three perspectives: the **normative**, the **situational**, and the **existential**. These correlate to the **lordship attributes** of God. The normative perspective answers to God’s **authority** as he speaks in Scripture; the situational perspective reflects God’s **control** over creation and history; the existential perspective accents God’s **covenantal presence** with persons by the Spirit. In The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God 1987, Frame argues that these perspectives are mutually implicative and never autonomous. The **normative** without the **situational** becomes abstract, the **situational** without the **normative** becomes relativistic, and the **existential** without both devolves into subjectivism. By grounding this triad in the **Trinity** and **lordship**, Frame presents a covenantal **epistemology** that rejects the **analogia entis**, affirms analogical yet true knowledge of God, and insists that all reasoning is **presuppositional** because it operates within divine **authority**. The triad becomes a meta-structure: it reappears in ethics, theology proper, hermeneutics, and ministry as a heuristic for wise judgment.

#### 3. Apologetics to the glory of God: presuppositions, evidences, and the transcendental
With **Apologetics to the Glory of God** 1994 and the expanded **Apologetics: A Justification of Christian Belief** 2015, Frame restated **Van Tilian** apologetics for a broader **evangelical** readership. He defends the **transcendental argument** that the Christian God is the necessary condition for the intelligibility of logic, morality, and induction. Yet unlike caricatures of hard presuppositionalism, Frame rehabilitates the role of **evidence** and **probability** as subordinate to, and interpreted within, biblical **presuppositions**. He appreciates **Alvin Plantinga’s** reformed epistemology, receives it as an ally against evidentialist foundationalism, and insists that **no neutrality** obtains in reason because of **covenant** allegiance. The **normative-situational-existential** triad clarifies apologetic practice: the **normative** delivers Scriptural criteria for truth and error, the **situational** marshals facts providentially governed by God, and the **existential** engages the heart’s **noetic** condition. Against **classical apologetics** that purport to argue from a putatively common natural theology to a generic deity, Frame claims that covenantal **lordship** must shape method from the outset, lest the result betray **sola Scriptura**.

#### 4. The Word of God as divine speech: inerrancy and speech acts
In **The Doctrine of the Word of God** 2010, Frame integrates **inerrancy**, canon, and inspiration with a **speech-act** analysis of Scripture. God’s Word is not merely a set of propositions but a complex act with **locutionary** content, **illocutionary** force, and **perlocutionary** effects. This aligns with his **lordship attributes**: God’s **authority** binds the church to the canon, his **control** ensures the Word accomplishes its purpose, and his **presence** accompanies Scripture with the Spirit’s illumination. Frame defends **inerrancy** as the necessary entailment of divine **truthfulness**, avoiding an instrumentalist view of biblical authority. His doctrine of Scripture resists both **neo-orthodox** reduction of revelation to *Verkündigung* and postconservative appeals to ongoing canonical reshaping. The triadic method also orders hermeneutics: the **normative** asks what Scripture teaches, the **situational** examines literary and historical context under **providence**, and the **existential** receives the text in repentant faith, recognizing the Spirit’s inward **testimonium**. Thus **sola Scriptura**, rightly construed, is not a naked prooftexting but a disciplined listening to the **speech** of the triune Lord.

#### 5. God of lordship: attributes, covenantal relation, and open theism refuted
With **The Doctrine of God** 2002, Frame offers a full **theology proper** in which divine **lordship** is the architectonic theme. God’s **authority**, **control**, and **covenantal presence** provide an organizing grammar for **aseity**, **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **omnipotence**. Frame affirms classical perfections while emphasizing the Bible’s dynamic descriptions of God’s relational **covenant** dealings. In **No Other God: A Response to Open Theism** 2001, he contests **open theism** as a failure to honor divine **omniscience** and **providence**, arguing that its claim that God does not know future free actions denies biblical **prophecy** and the **Lordship** revealed in Scripture. Frame is compatibilist on human freedom, defending covenantal responsibility under God’s meticulous **sovereignty**, and he takes pains to clarify anthropomorphic language as revelatory rather than misleading. His approach pushes against speculative metaphysics that sever **God-in-himself** from **God-for-us**, while maintaining **Creator-creature distinction** and analogical predication. The result is a theology proper crafted to be exegetically saturated, pastorally oriented, and **Reformed** in substance.

#### 6. Ethics under the Word: the Christian life, worship, and culture
In **The Doctrine of the Christian Life** 2008, Frame reconceives ethics as **application** of the Word of God by the people of God to all of life. The **normative** perspective supplies divine commands, the **situational** surveys the created order and providence, and the **existential** addresses motives, virtues, and conscience before God’s **presence**. His ethics affirms the abiding validity of the **moral law**, reads circumstantial case laws as wise applications, and resists both **legalism** and **antinomianism**. In **Worship in Spirit and Truth** 1996 and essays like **Contemporary Worship Music: A Biblical Defense** 1997, Frame restates the **regulative principle**. He contends that worship must be governed by Scripture’s **norms**, yet allows considerable latitude in **forms** as circumstances of worship. That position distances him from more restrictive **Puritan** applications while insisting on the **authority** of the Word. On culture and politics, **The Escondido Theology** 2011 critiques radical **Two Kingdoms** proposals associated with **Michael Horton** and **David VanDrunen**, arguing that their sharp law-gospel and church-world dichotomies undercut the church’s mission to address all areas of life under Christ’s **lordship**. Frame instead commends a transformational but non-utopian stance tied to **common grace** and the sovereignty of **Christ the King**.

#### 7. Knowledge of God and the task of theology: application as method
Frame’s first major book, **The Doctrine of the Knowledge of God** 1987, already crystallized his vision of **theological method**. Theology is the **application of Scripture** to all areas of life; it is not a speculative **theoria** but a practical **sapientia** aimed at obedience. This paradigm makes his **triperspectival** tool a pedagogical engine. The **normative** perspective highlights confessions and systematic coherence; the **situational** calls for exegesis, historical study, and awareness of providential realities; the **existential** requires faith, repentance, and spiritual formation. Frame accents the confessional heritage of the **Westminster Standards** while urging theological triage that distinguishes **sola fide** and **Trinity** from secondary matters. His **Systematic Theology** 2013 distills decades of teaching into an accessible yet serious compendium that embeds doctrine in Scripture citations, outlines, and applications. Throughout, **covenant**, **lordship**, and the **Trinity** order knowledge, and the rejection of autonomous **reason** keeps the academy subordinate to the **church’s** calling.

#### 8. Teachers and debates: Van Til, Poythress, Kline, and the evangelical public
Frame’s closest methodological partner has been **Vern S. Poythress**, whose own multiperspectival work at **Westminster** resonated with Frame’s triads. Together they are frequently labeled the **Frame-Poythress** school. Frame’s appreciative yet critical **Cornelius Van Til: An Analysis of His Thought** 1995 clarified Van Til’s **presuppositional** corpus for newcomers while pruning imprecisions. A different axis of debate emerged with **Meredith G. Kline** on covenant and culture, and later with **Michael Horton** and **David VanDrunen** over **Two Kingdoms**. On the doctrine of God, interlocutors include **Clark Pinnock** and **Greg Boyd** on **open theism**, and more recently **James Dolezal** on **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. In worship and ecclesiology, Frame’s criticisms of excessive **traditionalism** interact with **Puritan** legacies and modern **evangelical** practices. Professionally he taught at **Westminster** Philadelphia 1968 to 1980, helped launch **Westminster Seminary California** in 1980, and later moved to **RTS Orlando** in 2000, where he trained pastors and apologists for two decades. His ecclesial posture prizes **evangelical** cooperation, as seen in **Evangelical Reunion** 1991, which urges confessional churches to pursue visible unity without sacrificing **Reformed** distinctives.

#### 9. Doctrine of God under scrutiny: simplicity, language, and covenantal metaphysics
A contested zone in Frame’s work is the interface between classical **divine simplicity** and biblical depictions of God’s relational **presence**. In **The Doctrine of God** he affirms simplicity but resists formulations that, in his view, render God a property or evaporate the rich variety of Scriptural attributes into an undifferentiated essence. He prefers to say that all God’s attributes are fully interpenetrating expressions of his **lordship**, not parts composing him. Critics like **James Dolezal** read this as softening classical **immutability** and **impassibility**, while Frame replies that he opposes creaturely compositional schemas projected onto God and that he neither collapses **Creator-creature distinction** nor denies that God is *actus purus*. Frame’s insistence on the literal truth of many so-called **anthropomorphisms** operates covenantally: God truly, though analogically, loves, grieves, and delights, yet without passibility as in creatures. The point is exegetical fidelity within **covenantal** categories rather than speculative adjustment to philosophical systems. His method here mirrors his broader **triperspectival** stance: the **normative** controls metaphysics by Scripture, the **situational** consults historical theology, and the **existential** remembers that we speak of the One before whom we stand.

#### 10. Integrated legacy: a pastoral system for late-modern Reformed ministry
Frame’s corpus finally reads as a single project: to produce a **pastoral system** in which **lordship** frames knowledge, Scripture functions as **divine speech**, and the **tri-perspectival** pattern equips pastors to adjudicate complex questions in apologetics, ethics, worship, and doctrine. Against the fragmentation of late modern **evangelicalism**, he insists on **coherent** theological method that is at once doctrinally rigorous and practically wise. His long teaching tenure at **Westminster**, **WSC**, and **RTS** shaped generations of ministers who absorbed the **presuppositional** posture, the **speech-act** account of revelation, and the **revised regulative principle**. The teacher of apologetics became a systematizer of the Christian life; the student of **Van Til** became a clarifier for the next generation; the philosopher turned to the **church** to ask how doctrine bears fruit in worship, mission, and holiness under **Christ’s** kingship.

Reformed/WTS evaluation: As a **Westminster**-shaped theologian, Frame’s strengths are considerable: Scripture-saturated method, a constructive extension of **Van Til**, lucid defenses of **inerrancy** and **compatibilism**, and a practical ethic under **lordship**. Tensions arise at three points. First, his adjustments to classical **divine simplicity** and **immutability** risk ambiguity about *actus purus*, even as he avers the **Creator-creature distinction**; a more explicit retrieval of scholastic grammar could secure his covenantal insights without loosening metaphysical clarity. Second, his **revised regulative principle** offers needed flexibility but can be read as privileging the **situational-existential** against the **normative**; a tighter doctrine of circumstances and elements could guard catholicity in worship while honoring prudence. Third, his critique of radical **Two Kingdoms** rightly resists nature-grace dualisms yet may sometimes conflate **law-gospel** distinctions with quietism; a sharper covenantal reading of **creation** and **common grace** can uphold cultural vocation without ecclesial overreach. In all, within classical **Reformed** orthodoxy, Frame’s **triperspectival** method remains a potent tool, provided it is disciplined by the church’s **confessions**, the catholic consensus on **God-in-himself**, and the primacy of **revelation** as principium for faith and practice.
