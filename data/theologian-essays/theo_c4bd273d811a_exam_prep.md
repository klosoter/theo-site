### TITLE
Robert L. Dabney is a brilliant yet deeply compromised Old School Presbyterian who weds robust **Reformed scholasticism** to a reactionary and sinful defense of **slavery** and **Lost Cause** culture, forcing us to sift his theology with ruthless confessional and ethical clarity.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Nineteenth century **Robert L. Dabney** (1820–1898) ministers in the antebellum and postbellum American South, shaped by **Old School Presbyterianism** and the trauma of the **Civil War**.
- He stands amid **Princeton** and Southern Presbyterian currents, resisting **revivalism** and later **modernism**, while defending the **Lost Cause** and Southern culture.

- Dabney’s method is a self-consciously **confessional Reformed** system that treats **Scripture** as a coherent, scientific theology to be expounded by sanctified reason.
- He elevates **reason** and a common-sense **Scottish Realist** epistemology, insisting that theological science proceeds by logical deduction from inspired propositions.
- He emphasizes the **church’s teaching office** and the **confessions** as subordinate yet authoritative norms summarizing biblical doctrine.

- In **Systematic Theology** (1871), he presents a full Old School **Calvinist** dogmatics combating **Arminianism**, **Roman Catholicism**, and nascent liberalism.
- In **Lectures on Sacred Rhetoric** (1870s), he articulates a theology of **preaching** rooted in doctrinal solidity and experimental religion, opposing manipulative revivalist methods.
- In **Discussions: Evangelical and Theological** (3 vols., 1890–1892), he engages controversies on **predestination**, **church polity**, and sacramental theology.
- In his political and cultural essays such as **A Defense of Virginia and the South** (1867), he appallingly sacralizes **slavery**, patriarchy, and white supremacy as divinely ordered.

- Dabney is significant for **doctrine of Scripture and method**, embedding Old School verbal inspiration in a distinct **common-sense realist** framework.
- He contributes to **soteriology** and **providence**, giving sharp polemics against **Arminianism** and defending meticulous **divine sovereignty**.
- He is central in **church and culture**, modeling a confessional but disastrously compromised Christian social vision that baptizes **Southern slavery** and hierarchy.

- A Westminster examiner will want him located as a strongly **Reformed scholastic** and Old School thinker whose doctrine of **grace** is largely sound yet entangled with sinful cultural commitments.
- Examiners will expect explicit repudiation of his **slavery** and racial views, while also assessing how his **epistemology** and politics expose limits in Old School integration of theology and culture.

- Compare **Dabney vs Hodge** on Old School **Princeton** method and natural theology, and their differences in cultural and political posture.
- Compare **Dabney vs Van Til** on **epistemology**, particularly common-sense realism, antithesis, and the critique of autonomous reason.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Robert Lewis **Dabney** was born in 1820 in rural Virginia and ministered through the antebellum, Civil War, and Reconstruction eras, dying in 1898 after teaching at **Union Theological Seminary in Virginia** and later in Texas. He was formed by **Old School Presbyterianism**, Scottish common-sense philosophy, and the agrarian Southern gentry. Educated at **Hampden-Sydney**, the University of Virginia, and Union Seminary, he was both a parish pastor and theological professor. His experience as chaplain and then chief of staff for **Stonewall Jackson**, and the devastation of the Confederacy, hardened his commitment to Southern culture and the so-called **Lost Cause**. The driving problem of his theology is: how to defend a comprehensive, intellectually rigorous **Calvinism** and a hierarchical Southern social order against the twin threats of democratic egalitarianism in the civil sphere and **Arminian revivalism** and later **liberalism** in the church. His dogmatics, sermons, and polemical essays all aim to display historic **Reformed orthodoxy** as the only bulwark against theological and cultural decay, yet this aim is tragically entangled with his sinful defense of **slavery** and racial hierarchy.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Dabney’s method in **Systematic Theology** is self-consciously that of an Old School, confessional **Reformed scholastic**. He treats **Scripture** as a unified body of inspired, inerrant propositions from which a scientific theology can be constructed. Theology for **Dabney** is a *scientia* that organizes the facts of revelation into a coherent system under the guidance of sanctified reason. He explicitly aligns with **Scottish common-sense realism**, following thinkers like **Reid** and the Princeton tradition, affirming that human cognitive faculties, though fallen, are basically trustworthy as created by God. Thus **reason** is not an autonomous source of new truth but a necessary organ which, when regenerated and illumined by the **Holy Spirit**, can rightly interpret the data of biblical revelation.

At the same time, Dabney is wary of speculative **philosophy**. In **Systematic Theology** and his **Discussions**, he criticizes philosophical constructions that are not rigorously tethered to Scripture, whether Roman Catholic **natural theology** detached from revelation or rationalistic liberal theologies. Yet his own reliance on **common-sense realism** shows tension with a more antithetical **Van Tilian** epistemology, since he tends to assume a broad continuity between regenerate and unregenerate cognition at the level of first principles. The church and her **confessions** play a subordinate but weighty role for Dabney. He treats the **Westminster Standards** as the best human summary of biblical doctrine, binding on ministers, and insists the church as a visible, organized society must guard and transmit this confessional heritage.

Dabney’s sense of **history** and **experience** is complex. He strongly opposes the revivalist emphasis on immediate religious experience detached from doctrine, for instance in his critiques of **Finneyite** methods, yet he affirms **experimental religion** as essential. True experience is the Spirit’s application of doctrinal truth to the heart in the communion of the visible church. Historical providence, such as the story of **Israel** or the rise and decline of nations, is interpreted through the lenses of covenant and divine judgment. Here, however, his reading of American and Southern history becomes ideologically distorted, as seen in **A Defense of Virginia and the South**, where his theological method is misused to sacralize a sinful social order. The tension between his methodological commitments to Scriptural supremacy and his cultural blind spots is one of the most important exam pressure points when assessing his use of **revelation**, **reason**, and **history**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the Reformed confessional baseline is that Holy Scripture is the inspired, inerrant, sufficient, and perspicuous Word of God, the only rule of faith and obedience, as articulated in **Westminster Confession of Faith** chapters 1 and 2. Dabney, in **Systematic Theology** and essays in **Discussions: Evangelical and Theological**, strongly reaffirms this doctrine. He defends verbal **inspiration**, combats early forms of **higher criticism**, and argues for the harmony of biblical teaching. Over against **Roman Catholicism**, he insists on the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture apart from a magisterial church, and against **rationalism** he insists that revelation sets the first principles for all true theology and philosophy. Yet the way he grounds the authority of Scripture in **common-sense realism** and arguments from probability and moral certainty shows a distinct methodological flavor shared with **Hodge** and **Princeton**, yet later criticized by **Van Til** for not sufficiently acknowledging the antithesis between believer and unbeliever and the necessity of presupposing the truth of **revelation** rather than proving it from neutral premises. Dabney’s contribution here is a lucid, pastorally oriented presentation of Old School bibliology, while the tension lies in his apologetic posture.

Second, in **soteriology and providence**, the classic Reformed baseline is a robust doctrine of total depravity, unconditional election, particular redemption, efficacious calling, and perseverance, grounded in meticulous **divine sovereignty** and a compatibilist view of human freedom, as seen in **Calvin** and **Turretin**. Dabney is one of the sharpest nineteenth century defenders of this **Calvinist** system. In **Systematic Theology** and essays against **Arminianism** and **Amyraldianism**, he defends unconditional **election**, particular atonement, and the irresistibility of grace. He is especially concerned to maintain that divine decree and providence are exhaustive, governing all events, while still affirming real secondary causes and genuine moral agency. He vigorously opposes any form of libertarian free will, arguing instead for a moral necessity grounded in character and inclination. In debates with **Arminians** and New School Presbyterians, he stresses the monergistic work of the **Holy Spirit** in regeneration. His polemical clarity and insistence on the pastoral power of predestination echo earlier Reformed scholastics and anticipate later writers like **Bavinck** and **Boettner**, even though his philosophical framework lacks the transcendental critique later articulated by **Van Til**.

Third, in the locus of **church, sacraments, and ministry**, the confessional baseline is that Christ has instituted a visible, ordered church with Word and sacrament as central means of grace, governed by elders, and distinct from yet related to the civil sphere, as in **Westminster** chapters 25–31. Dabney, drawing on the Southern Presbyterian tradition of **Thornwell** and **Palmer**, is a strong advocate of **Presbyterian polity** and the spirituality of the church. In his discussions on **ecclesiology** and in his **Lectures on Sacred Rhetoric**, he emphasizes the primacy of doctrinal preaching, the centrality of the Lord’s Day assembly, and the ordinary means of grace. He opposes revivalistic innovations like the anxious bench and manipulative altar calls as assaults on the God-ordained ministry of Word and sacrament. His defense of a regulated worship and the parity of elders aligns him with confessional **Presbyterian** orthodoxy and against both episcopal hierarchy and congregational individualism. However, the Southern doctrine of the church’s spirituality, which Dabney shares, can function ambiguously: on one side it protects the church from being swallowed by political programs, on the other side it is used to silence ecclesial critique of grave civil sins like **slavery**, thus exposing a problematic application of an otherwise sound principle.

Fourth, in **church and culture**, especially social ethics, the Reformed baseline is that Christ is Lord over all of life, that natural law and special revelation together witness to basic moral norms, and that all forms of oppression and injustice contradict the **image of God** and neighbor love. Here Dabney is at his most problematic and morally disqualifying. In **A Defense of Virginia and the South** and other essays, he offers a theological argument for **slavery**, patriarchy, and racial hierarchy, claiming biblical warrant for the permanent subordination of blacks and women in both church and society. He presents slavery as a benign, even evangelically beneficial institution and treats abolitionism as an attack on divine providence and social order. Against Northern evangelicals and some **Old School** critics, he insists that the Bible sanctions slavery as such and that the Southern system was comparatively humane. This is not a marginal part of his corpus but integral to his social vision. From a confessional Reformed standpoint, this represents a foundational betrayal of **justice** and creation order, a sinful misuse of Scripture, and a blindness to the catholic tradition’s insistence on the equal dignity of all humans in **Adam** and in Christ. Theologically strong loci in his work cannot sanitize this profound ethical and hermeneutical failure, which must be frontally repudiated in any responsible assessment.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Dabney stands in substantial doctrinal continuity with classical **Reformed orthodoxy** on many central loci. On Scripture, God, Trinity, Christology, and salvation, his **Systematic Theology** is recognizably in the line of **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Standards**, mediated through American Old School thought. His emphasis on the sovereignty of God, the penal substitutionary nature of the atonement, and monergistic grace anticipates later systematic syntheses like those of **Bavinck** and **Berkhof**. His homiletical theory in **Lectures on Sacred Rhetoric** embodies a Reformed commitment to doctrinally rich, heart-searching preaching aligned with **Puritan** and **Dutch Reformed** piety. In this sense, he can be received as a serious, if regional, representative of nineteenth century Reformed scholastic continuity.

However, in relation to later Reformed developments, especially at **Westminster Seminary**, Dabney’s epistemological and cultural stances become more problematic. His reliance on **Scottish common-sense realism** appears, from a **Van Tilian** perspective, as an overestimation of the neutrality of human reason and an underestimation of the noetic effects of sin. While sharing with **Hodge** the desire for a scientific theology, he lacks the presuppositional rigor that later Reformed apologists deemed necessary in the face of modern and postmodern thought. More gravely, his theological defense of **slavery** and white supremacy is a deep rupture with the law of love and catholic Christian ethics. A Westminster examiner must object unequivocally at this point, acknowledging that Dabney’s social ethics and hermeneutical deployment of Scripture to support race-based hierarchy are not adiaphora but grievous sins. Another necessary objection concerns his use of the church’s spirituality doctrine to mute prophetic critique of structural injustices.

Yet there are also points where Reformed theologians can learn from **Dabney** while firmly rejecting his cultural sins. His stringent opposition to manipulative **revivalism**, his insistence on doctrinal content in preaching, and his robust defense of the ordinary means of grace offer needed correctives in an age of ecclesial pragmatism. His clear articulation of **predestination** and providence as pastoral comfort rather than speculative fatalism can also serve as a model. The task for contemporary Reformed theology is not to rehabilitate Dabney as a hero but to receive some of his doctrinal clarity and pastoral seriousness while openly naming and rejecting the structural injustices he defended.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, some sentences are safe to say almost verbatim at the outset. It is safe to open by saying that **Robert L. Dabney** is a nineteenth century Old School Presbyterian theologian whose **Systematic Theology** offers a robustly confessional Calvinist dogmatics, yet whose social ethics are deeply compromised by a theological defense of **slavery**. It is also safe to say that Dabney stands broadly in continuity with **Westminster Calvinism** on Scripture and salvation, while his use of **Scottish common-sense realism** as an epistemological framework would later be critiqued by **Van Til**. These opening lines position him both within and in tension with the Reformed tradition and signal to the committee that you will not romanticize his legacy.

Certain phrases, however, must be avoided or heavily qualified. One must not speak of Dabney as a simple **Reformed hero** or as a trustworthy guide to Christian social thought. Any positive mention of his **Southern** cultural vision must be accompanied by explicit repudiation of his pro-slavery and racist arguments. Avoid saying that he merely reflected the views of his time, since this obscures the fact that many contemporary **Reformed** and evangelical figures opposed slavery on theological grounds. When speaking of his **epistemology**, avoid unqualified praise of his common-sense realism as neutral or universally valid. Instead, qualify it by noting that while he affirms the created reliability of human faculties, from a **Van Tilian** perspective his approach risks giving too much autonomy to natural reason.

Examiners may exploit typical student misunderstandings. One misunderstanding is to treat Dabney as simply a Southern version of **Hodge** without recognizing the moral and hermeneutical stakes of his defense of **slavery**. Another is to overstate his epistemological distance from classic Reformed scholasticism, as if he invented the Old School scientific model of theology, when in fact he continues an existing trajectory. Examiners might press you by asking whether his theology is invalidated entirely by his racism. A nuanced answer should affirm that his doctrinal articulations on issues like **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **soteriology** can still be substantially sound and useful, while insisting that his misuse of Scripture in social ethics reveals a fracture in his practical hermeneutics that must be identified and rejected. They may also probe how you would relate Dabney to **Van Til**. Here you can say that Dabney’s confidence in common-sense **reason** marks him as a forerunner of Old Princeton that Van Til will later criticize, while both share a high view of revelation and divine sovereignty. Finally, be prepared to distinguish clearly between doctrinal loci where Dabney remains a resource and cultural or ethical loci where he functions as a cautionary example for the Reformed tradition.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster standpoint, Robert L. **Dabney** should be regarded as a theologically serious but morally compromised Old School Presbyterian whose **Systematic Theology** largely upholds confessional orthodoxy on God, Christ, Scripture, and salvation, yet whose social thought, especially his defense of **slavery** and racial hierarchy, stands in direct contradiction to the law of God and the catholic Christian doctrine of human dignity; we can affirm his clear articulation of **Reformed** soteriology, his insistence on the authority and sufficiency of Scripture, and his critique of revivalistic excess, while non-negotiably denying and condemning his pro-slavery hermeneutics, his racialized hierarchy, and his overconfident common-sense epistemology, and if asked where we land we should say that Dabney remains, at best, a limited and cautionary resource whose doctrinal clarity in some loci must be carefully disentangled from and judged against the plain teaching of **Scripture** and the broader Reformed tradition on justice, neighbor love, and the lordship of Christ over all of life.
