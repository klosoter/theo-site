### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Gregg Strawbridge emerged as a pastor-theologian in late twentieth-century American **Reformed** life, where debates about **covenant theology**, **sacramental practice**, and the shape of **biblical-theological** exegesis had re-entered the mainstream of evangelical discussion. He ministered and wrote during the years when the **Federal Vision** debate forced renewed attention to **visible church** boundaries, **means of grace**, and the **objectivity of the covenant**. His pastoral base in congregational ministry and his curatorial work through **WordMp3.com** placed him at the nexus of conferences and debates that included figures such as **Douglas Wilson**, **Peter Leithart**, and critics within the **PCA** and **OPC**. His method was unapologetically covenantal, employing **redemptive-historical** continuity, attention to canonical trajectories, and the confessional grammar of **sign and seal** to defend **paedobaptism** and advocate **paedocommunion**.

Strawbridge’s theological self-presentation was as a classic **Reformed** exegete rather than a speculative dogmatician. He leaned on **John Murray** and **Pierre Marcel** for the architecture of **paedobaptism**, on **Calvin** and **Bavinck** for the ontology of **covenant** and **church**, and on **Vosian** and **biblical-theological** sensibilities to argue that the **Abrahamic covenant** remains constitutive for the **ecclesia** under the **New Covenant**. The leitmotif of his method was the claim that the Bible’s own central category is **covenant continuity** rather than discontinuity, and that this continuity governs both **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper**. His rhetoric focused on the **household principle**, the **federal holiness** of the children of believers, and the ecclesial shape of the **means of grace**, insisting that *ordo salutis* questions of individual experience must be situated within the *historia salutis* pattern of God’s administration of the **covenant of grace**.

#### 2. The case for paedobaptism: covenant continuity and ecclesial inclusion
Strawbridge’s editorship of **The Case for Covenantal Infant Baptism** in 2003 gathered and sharpened exegetical and dogmatic arguments rooted in the **Abrahamic promise**. The thesis is straightforward: in Genesis 17 God covenants not only with Abraham but with his **household**, marking the *seed* with a **sacramental sign** that indexes divine promise and obligations. This **household principle** persists in the **New Covenant** because, as **Paul** teaches in Galatians 3, faith in **Christ** grafts Gentiles into Abraham’s **seed**, not into a fundamentally new, non-familial administrative arrangement. Thus, the **sign and seal** shift from circumcision to **baptism**, but the subjects, namely the believer and his **children**, remain included in the **visible church**.

The exegetical pillars in Strawbridge’s presentation were familiar yet carefully argued. First, **Acts** narrates several **household baptisms** that are most plausibly read against the grain of Abrahamic **covenant inclusion**, not as atomized individual professions alone. Second, **1 Corinthians 7:14** says the children of a believing parent are **holy**, which Strawbridge construes as **federal holiness** within the **visible church**, a status ordinarily signified by **baptism**. Third, the **Great Commission** in Matthew 28 assumes a mission of **discipling the nations**, which under a biblical-theological lens includes ordering **households** under Christ’s rule. These claims were wedded to a sacramental realism that refused **Zwinglian memorialism**; **baptism** is a **means of grace**, not a bare profession of personal faith, even as its efficacy is tied to **Christ** and received by **faith** in God’s time.

The polemical edge of the 2003 volume took aim at **credobaptist** hermeneutics represented in wider evangelicalism. Strawbridge argued that to sever **baptism** from **covenant succession** is to adopt a radical discontinuity between **Old** and **New Covenants** that neither **Pauline theology** nor **Reformed confessions** license. The point was not sacramental automaton but **covenant objectivity**: God marks a **people** through visible ordinances. On this reading, denying the **sign** to believers’ children is a failure to receive the **Abrahamic continuity** that defines the **church** as *familia Dei*. The essays pressed a practical pastoral claim as well: **baptism**, when paired with **catechesis**, forms children in the **means of grace** and publicly places them under **discipline**, a reality that serves both **nurture** and **accountability**.

#### 3. From font to table: the contested move to paedocommunion
If **paedobaptism** consolidated classical **Reformed** instincts about the **covenant of grace**, Strawbridge’s 2006 editorship of **The Case for Covenant Communion: Children and the Lord’s Supper** pressed a more controversial agenda. The volume contended that the same **covenant membership** that warrants **baptism** likewise warrants access to the **Eucharist**. The argument pivoted on three claims: covenantal typology, apostolic instruction, and historical practice.

First, covenantal typology drew on **Passover** and other **Old Covenant** sacred meals. Strawbridge and his contributors argued that Israel’s memorial meals regularly included **children** within the ritual ecosystem of remembrance and proclamation. In this typological logic, **1 Corinthians 10** teaches that **baptized** Christians partake of **spiritual food and drink** in **Christ**, and that the **Lord’s Supper** functions as a covenantal meal for the entire **people of God**. Second, apostolic instruction in **1 Corinthians 11** about discernment and examination was read corporately rather than individualistically. On this construal, to discern the **body** is to reckon with the **church** as the **body of Christ**, mending divisions and receiving one another in unity, not to require a threshold of introspective rationality that would necessarily exclude the *parvuli*. Third, historical practice furnished supporting evidence. Strawbridge cited the prevalence of **infant communion** in the **East** and testimonies of **early Western** usage to argue that denying covenant children the **table** is not simply the unbroken Christian norm but a development shaped by medieval penitential and scholastic concerns foreign to early **Reformed** instincts about **means of grace**.

In articulating **covenant communion**, Strawbridge refused both **sacramentalism** and **memorialism**. The **Supper** was confessed as a **means of grace** in union with **Christ**, effective according to God’s promise, and to be guarded by **discipline**. Admission, however, was connected to **baptismal status**, not to an age of discretion defined as a personal capacity for self-examination in modern terms. The pastoral proposal was to catechize from the cradle, to fence the table by **church oversight**, and to allow for **covenant children** to receive the **elements** as participants in the **visible church** unless under discipline. The effect was to constrain the gap between font and table, insisting that **covenant signs** mark covenant members for participation in the whole economy of **means of grace**.

#### 4. Interlocutors, confessional alignment, and contested exegesis
The debates that surrounded Strawbridge’s work were intense and precise, drawing responses from confessional **Presbyterians** and Reformed **Baptists**. On **paedobaptism**, interlocutors such as **Tom Schreiner** and **Shawn Wright** in the 2006 volume **Believer’s Baptism** reiterated the case for **credobaptism** from **New Testament** patterns of repentance and faith preceding **baptism**. Strawbridge’s rejoinders pressed the **household principle** and the axial role of **Abrahamic continuity**. He also appealed to **John Murray** and **Pierre Marcel** to underscore that **baptism** is a divine ordinance marking **covenant membership**, with faith as its proper reception rather than its prerequisite marker in every case.

On **paedocommunion**, formal confessional bodies weighed in. The **PCA** produced a study report in 1988 concluding against the practice, and the **OPC** followed with analysis and recommendations in the mid-2000s that likewise counseled restraint. The exegetical hinge rested on **1 Corinthians 11**. Critics such as **Cornelis Venema** and **Guy Waters** argued that the apostolic requirement of **self-examination** and **discernment** presupposes the communicant’s ability to recognize the **body and blood** of **Christ** in the elements and to judge oneself rightly, and that this is not ordinarily predicated of **young children**. Strawbridge’s response reframed the required discernment as ecclesial: the **body** to be discerned is fundamentally the **church**, and the sin is not cognitive incapacity but **schism** and **contempt** toward fellow members. Further, he noted, the **Westminster Standards** do not explicitly exclude baptized children, even if the catechetical tradition in **Reformed** churches has generally required a **credible profession** prior to admission.

Notably, Strawbridge’s exegetical and historical appeals were ecumenically sensitive without abandoning **Reformed** convictions. He could cite **Calvin’s Institutes** on the **means of grace** while also pointing to the practice of the **Eastern churches** in maintaining **infant communion**, suggesting that Christian tradition is more complex than a linear Western catechetical model often presumes. Yet he also underscored **church discipline** and the pastoral care of communicants, arguing that **paedocommunion** strengthens rather than weakens the **fencing of the table** by recognizing that children stand under the church’s **oversight** from their **baptism** onward.

#### 5. Covenant objectivity and pastoral theology
Beneath Strawbridge’s sacramental arguments lay a coherent pastoral theology of **covenant objectivity**. He consistently taught that the **visible church** is a real, covenantally constructed community into which God incorporates believers and their **children** through **baptism**, and within which God nourishes them by **Word** and **Sacrament**. This objectivity does not collapse the **decretal** and **administrative** dimensions of the **covenant of grace**, but it insists that the external administration matters because God has bound himself to meet his people through appointed **means**. His categories therefore respected the Reformed distinction between **sign and thing signified**, while refusing to reduce the sign to a mere badge of human testimony. The language of **covenant succession** functioned as a pastoral charter for robust **catechesis**, **family worship**, and communal **discipleship** ordered to the formation of children as members of the **church**.

This pastoral emphasis shaped his approach to **discipline** as well. If **baptism** places a child within the realm of **church** responsibility, then admonition, instruction, and corrective measures are exercised covenantally. The **Lord’s Supper** becomes part of an economy of nurture rather than a reward at the end of schooling. Strawbridge’s contrast here was not primarily with classic **Reformed** practice but with modern evangelical subjectivism. He aimed to recover a **Reformed catholicity** in which the **church** acts as mother, the **sacraments** as instruments of divine hospitality, and **discipline** as familial rather than forensic.

#### 6. Historical retrieval and the problem of development
Strawbridge’s appeal to history was selective yet pointed. He acknowledged that **Calvin** and the **Reformed confessions** rejected **paedocommunion**, but he argued that this rejection reflects a particular exegesis of **1 Corinthians 11** and a reaction to medieval **sacramentalism**, not an insuperable boundary of **Reformed** identity. In this telling, the early **church’s** tendency to include **children** at the table, attested more clearly in the **East** and in some **Western** witnesses, suggests that later **Western** developments around **penance**, **confession**, and a discursive model of **examination** narrowed the table more than the **New Testament** warrants. His retrieval was thus both **catholic** and reforming: he placed **Reformed** practice within the larger stream of Christian **tradition**, while appealing to **Scripture** as the final norm for development or correction of inherited patterns.

At the same time, he kept his feet planted in the **Reformed confessional** soil. He upheld **divine sovereignty**, **justification by faith alone**, and the **ordinary means of grace**, signaled by his consistent resistance to any conflation of **baptism** or the **Supper** with automatic salvation. The **sacraments** are covenantal ordinances that must be received by **faith**, and unbelief does not nullify the **promise**, though it magnifies **judgment** upon unworthy receivers who despise the **body**. His approach thus brought **Reformed orthodoxy** into conversation with a broader **patristic** and **liturgical** horizon in a way that aimed to strengthen rather than weaken the **church’s** sacramental life.

#### 7. Platforms, debates, and influence
Beyond printed volumes, Strawbridge’s influence radiated through his curation of debates and lectures on **WordMp3.com**, an early and durable platform for distributing **Reformed** theological audio. Through this channel he convened or preserved dialogues on **baptism**, **the Lord’s Supper**, **worship**, and the contours of **covenant theology** in the wake of the **Federal Vision** debates. These exchanges placed him in a mediating position: sympathetic to the **covenant objectivity** instincts of **Wilson** and **Leithart**, yet frequently careful to stabilize **justification** and the **imputation** of **Christ’s righteousness** according to classical **Reformed** confessions.

His pastoral work and public scholarship coalesced in a ministry marked by practical catechetical resources, sermons expounding **covenant** texts, and dialogues with **Baptist** interlocutors. He died in 2022, leaving behind a paper trail and an audio archive that continue to serve pastors and students wrestling with the **sacramental** and **ecclesiological** implications of **covenant theology**. The cumulative effect is an agenda of **Reformed catholicity** oriented to the ontological solidity of **church membership** and the formative role of **means of grace**.

#### 8. Systematic synthesis and doctrinal profile
Systematically, Strawbridge’s work can be plotted along several axes. On the axis of **covenant theology**, he stands within the mainstream **covenant of grace** trajectory, pressing **Abrahamic continuity**, **household inclusion**, and the **visible-invisible church** distinction as foundational. On the axis of **sacramentology**, he leans into **sacramental realism** under the rubric of **sign and seal**, assigning **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper** their full **means-of-grace** character without crossing into **ex opere operato**. On the axis of **ecclesiology**, he argues for the **objectivity of the covenant** against evangelical individualism, proposing **covenant succession** as an antidote to the erosion of **church** formation among children of believers. On the axis of **hermeneutics**, he privileges **biblical theology** and canonical continuity, aiming to tether **church practice** to the grain of the **Scriptures** rather than to extrascriptural sociological thresholds.

The integrated picture is one in which **baptism** is not simply the badge of belief but God’s **covenant sign** that places a name under **discipleship**, and the **Supper** is not a privatized devotional act but the household meal of the **people of God**. The contested move is the linkage of **baptismal status** to **Eucharistic admission** as a matter of principle. Here his synthesis provokes sustained engagement with the **Westminster Standards**, the **Reformed** catechetical inheritance, and the exegetical weight of **1 Corinthians 11**. Yet even where disagreement persists, the internal coherence of his covenantal frame, the pastoral aim toward **nurture**, and the refusal to collapse **grace** into **sacramentalism** display a disciplined **Reformed** dogmatic sensibility.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Strawbridge’s strengths are notable. He retrieves **covenant continuity** with exegetical nerve, keeps **sacramental realism** tethered to **Christ** and **faith**, and foregrounds the **visible church** as the Spirit’s arena for **means of grace**. His use of **Murray** and **Marcel** on **paedobaptism** coheres with the best of twentieth-century **Reformed** dogmatics. The points of tension concentrate in his advocacy of **paedocommunion**. First, his corporate reading of **1 Corinthians 11** rightly stresses ecclesial unity, yet it underweights the apostolic logic of **self-examination** and **discerning the body**, which in the confessional stream of **Westminster** has been taken to require a **credible profession** and capacity for catechetically formed discernment before admission. Second, his historical retrieval of early **infant communion** registers real diversity in Christian tradition, but it risks flattening the reasons the Reformed rejected the practice, namely, the practical necessity of **fencing the table** in a doctrine of **discipline** that protects both the sanctity of the **Supper** and the souls of the unready. Third, his linkage of **baptism** to the **Supper** as coextensive signs can blur the pedagogical function of **catechesis** that mediates between covenant **inclusion** and covenant **participation**, particularly where the **Standards** speak of receiving the **Supper** in remembrance, thanksgiving, and spiritual feeding by **faith**. A WTS-shaped alternative would affirm his **covenant succession** and **paedobaptism**, intensify cradle-to-table **catechesis**, and maintain admission to the **Supper** upon **credible profession**, thus preserving both **covenant objectivity** and the **fencing** commended by **1 Corinthians 11** and embedded in classical **Reformed** practice.
