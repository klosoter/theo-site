### TITLE
Peter Lillback models a consciously confessional, historically informed Reformed pastoral theology that weds **Westminster orthodoxy**, **Van Tilian presuppositionalism**, and vigorous **church–culture engagement**.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Born **1946**, teaching and leading chiefly from the late twentieth century onward, **Peter A. Lillback** stands within the conservative **American Presbyterian** and **evangelical** renewal movements that reacted against both liberalism and broad evangelical drift.
- Serving at **Westminster Theological Seminary** and involved in **Presbyterian Church in America** circles, he operates in the stream shaped by **Machen**, **Van Til**, and the confessional recovery movements of the **1960s–2000s**.

- Methodologically, Lillback is a self-conscious **confessional Reformed** theologian, giving primacy to **Scripture** read through the **Westminster Standards** as a faithful summary.
- He adopts a strongly **Van Tilian** stance on **epistemology** and **apologetics**, stressing the antithesis between belief and unbelief and the necessity of presupposing the triune God of Scripture.
- His method is also deeply **historical-theological**, mining **Reformation** and **post-Reformation** sources to buttress contemporary **pastoral** and **cultural** questions.

- In **The Binding of God** 2001, Lillback argues that **Calvin** exhibits a robust **covenant theology**, countering claims that federal theology is a later distortion of Calvin.
- In **Wall of Misconception** 2011, he critiques the secularist reading of **church–state separation** in the United States and defends a historically grounded, Christian-friendly view of **public theology**.
- Through edited volumes and essays on **Luther**, **Calvin**, and **Reformation tradition**, he presses the continuity of classic **Reformed orthodoxy** into modern pastoral and cultural controversies.
- In numerous **pastoral theology** writings and addresses as **WTS president**, he urges ministers to root **preaching**, **piety**, and pastoral care in robust confessional doctrine and redemptive history.

- Doctrinally, Lillback is most significant for **covenant theology**, especially Calvin studies, for **Scripture and confessionalism** in an age of evangelical pragmatism, and for **church and culture** engagement in the American context.
- His work also touches **ecclesiology** and **pastoral ministry**, arguing for confessional **Presbyterian** polity and a serious view of the **means of grace**.
- In **apologetics** he stands within the **Van Til** line, connecting presuppositionalism to broader questions of **revelation** and culture.

- For a Westminster exam, you must show how Lillback reinforces **Reformed confessionalism** and **covenant theology** over against both broad evangelicalism and revisionist readings of Calvin.
- You should also acknowledge that his **church–state** and **American founding** emphases require careful distinction between principled **public theology** and any sacralizing of American civil religion.

- Comparison handles will include **Calvin vs later federal theologians** on covenant, in dialogue with Lillback’s thesis against scholars like **R. T. Kendall** or **Brian Armstrong**.
- You should also connect him to **Van Til vs evidentialism** in apologetics and to **Machen vs mainline Protestantism** when discussing confessional identity and culture.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Peter A. Lillback, born in **1946**, comes of age theologically in the wake of mid twentieth century **evangelicalism**, the **fundamentalist–modernist** controversies, and the consolidation of **confessional Presbyterianism** in bodies like the Orthodox Presbyterian Church and the Presbyterian Church in America. Educated at **Cedarville**, **Dallas Theological Seminary**, and **Westminster Theological Seminary**, he is shaped by a move from generic evangelical and dispensational settings toward a fully **Reformed confessional** stance. His later pastoral ministry in **PCA** congregations and leadership as president of **Westminster Seminary** in Philadelphia locate him squarely in the Machen–Van Til line of conservative Presbyterianism. Theologically and institutionally he sees himself as heir to **Machen’s Christianity and Liberalism**, contending that the core struggle of his era is the integrity of historic Christian orthodoxy in a context of both theological liberalism and soft, experience driven evangelicalism.

The driving problem in Lillback’s work is how to maintain a robust, historically rooted **Reformed orthodoxy** that can sustain pastoral ministry and faithful cultural presence in late modern America. Against revisionist readings of **Calvin** and the **Reformation**, and against a pragmatic, doctrine-light evangelical culture, he aims to show that doctrine, piety, and mission flourish only when tethered to serious **covenant theology** and to the **Westminster Standards**. At the same time, he is wrestling with the problem of a secularizing public square and a misreading of the American **church–state** tradition. He wants to retrieve a historically informed Christian presence in public life that takes both **religious liberty** and Christ’s cosmic Lordship seriously. Thus, the two most persistent axes of his work are, first, the vindication of confessional Reformed theology as the authentic heir of **Calvin and the Reformation**, and second, the articulation of a distinctly Christian approach to **culture and politics** in the American context.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Lillback’s method is self consciously **confessional and scriptural**, but also deeply **historical**. He affirms the classical Reformed conviction that **Scripture** is the *principium cognoscendi* of theology, the governing revelation of the triune God, and he treats the **Westminster Confession and Catechisms** as a faithful summary of that revelation. In this sense he stands firmly with **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** in insisting that theology is the disciplined exposition of God’s self revelation in Christ and Scripture, not a constructive projection of human religious consciousness. His work on **covenant** in Calvin is driven by careful exegesis and by analysis of primary sources, not by speculative philosophy. He understands **revelation** as the living speech of God, inscripturated and sufficient, which both grounds and critiques all theological reasoning, church tradition, and cultural engagement.

At the same time, Lillback is a convinced **Van Tilian** regarding **reason** and **epistemology**. Following **Cornelius Van Til**, he stresses that all human thinking is covenantally conditioned and either obedient or disobedient with respect to God’s revelation. There is no neutral ground between belief and unbelief, so he approaches **church history**, **philosophy**, and **culture** with an antithetical lens. Reason is a servant and instrument of faith, not an independent arbiter over revelation. In apologetics and cultural analysis he rejects any form of **autonomous reason** or natural theology that presumes a shared epistemic platform with the unbeliever apart from common grace and suppressed knowledge of God. Yet he also insists, in line with Van Til’s use of **general revelation**, that all of history and culture are saturated with God’s revelation and are therefore legitimate objects of theological reflection under Scripture.

His use of **experience** is pastoral rather than foundational. In preaching, counseling, and piety he treats the believer’s experience of **union with Christ**, the witness of the **Spirit**, and the corporate life of the **church** as important confirmations and manifestations of revealed truth. However, he does not follow a **Schleiermacher** style of grounding theology in religious consciousness; instead, he reads experience through the lens of Scripture and confessional doctrine. In his institutional leadership and pastoral writings he consistently points ministers back to the ordinary **means of grace** and to the corporate life of the church as the God ordained matrix in which we know and live before the triune God.

Historically, Lillback leans heavily on the **Reformation and post-Reformation orthodox** writers as sources and dialogue partners. In **The Binding of God** he mines **Calvin’s Institutes**, commentaries, sermons, and letters, and he reads Calvin alongside later federal theologians like **Olevianus** and **Ursinus**. His method here is to let the historical sources speak on their own terms, while also subjecting modern historiography to critical scrutiny. He interacts with scholars like **R. T. Kendall** and **Brian Armstrong**, challenging their theses about a gulf between Calvin and subsequent Reformed orthodoxy. Thus his historiographical stance is simultaneously retrieval oriented and polemical, seeking to restore confidence in **Reformed scholastic continuity** rather than to accept the dichotomy between a pure Calvin and a distorted later system.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **covenant theology**, Lillback’s most significant work is **The Binding of God: Calvin’s Role in the Development of Covenant Theology** 2001. The confessional baseline is the classic Reformed view that the triune God voluntarily condescends through a **covenant of works** with Adam and a **covenant of grace** with fallen humanity, culminating in Christ, and that this covenantal framework is deeply rooted in Scripture and normed by the **Westminster Standards**. Modern scholarship had often claimed that Calvin himself was only minimally covenantal and that full federal theology, with covenants of works and grace, was a later construction that perhaps distorted Calvin’s thought. Lillback challenges this by combing Calvin’s corpus and arguing that Calvin is far more structurally covenantal than is often recognized, and that the later **Reformed orthodox** did not betray but rather developed his insights. He positions himself against interlocutors like **Kendall**, who saw a divergence between Calvin and later federalism, and in doing so he strengthens the confessional case that covenant theology is not an alien accretion but integral to the Reformed tradition’s faithful reading of Scripture.

Second, in the area of **Scripture, confessionalism, and ecclesiology**, Lillback makes a sustained contribution through his teaching, preaching, and institutional leadership rather than through a single monograph. The confessional baseline is the Reformed conviction that **Scripture alone** is the inerrant, sufficient rule of faith and life, and that the **church’s confessions** are subordinate but binding standards that safeguard sound doctrine. Faced with a broad evangelical milieu that often treats doctrinal standards as optional and Scripture as practically subordinate to method or experience, Lillback argues that the health of the church depends on clear, robust commitment to the **Westminster Confession** and to expository preaching that expounds all of Scripture as a unified redemptive historical revelation. In chapel addresses and essays as **Westminster Seminary** president, he has insisted that a seminary must be confessional in more than name, and he counters both liberal theological drift and pragmatic mega church models. In conversation with interlocutors like **D. A. Carson** or **John Frame** on issues of confessional subscription and theological method, he tends to stress continuity with classic **Orthodox Presbyterian** and **PCA** commitments.

Third, in the locus of **church and culture**, especially regarding **church–state relations** in the American context, Lillback’s notable public work is **Wall of Misconception** 2011. The classic Reformed baseline, seen in figures like **Calvin** and **Turretin**, is that Christ is Lord over all of life, that the civil magistrate is under the moral law of God, and that yet the institutional church and the state are distinct with different spheres. In modern American legal and cultural discourse, however, the metaphor of a **wall of separation** between church and state derived from **Thomas Jefferson** is often taken to mean the exclusion of religious reasoning from the public square. Lillback argues historically and theologically that this radical secularist reading is not faithful to the **Founders**, that **religious liberty** was meant to secure rather than suppress religious expression in public life, and that Christians should recover a confident, principled presence in politics and culture while rejecting both theocracy and privatized piety. His interlocutors include secularist legal theorists and some Christian advocates of a strict separationism. While his work here is more historical and political than dogmatic, it expresses a theological conviction about the **Lordship of Christ** over culture and the duty of believers to bear witness in every sphere.

Fourth, in **apologetics and epistemology**, although not as systematizing as **Van Til** or **Greg Bahnsen**, Lillback nonetheless articulates a clear presuppositional approach in line with the Westminster tradition. The baseline is the Reformed emphasis that fallen human reason suppresses the truth of **general revelation** and that saving knowledge of God comes only through **special revelation**, received by faith. Lillback, drawing on **Van Til’s** corpus, emphasizes that every argument either honors or dishonors God’s self attesting authority and that the Christian apologist must presuppose the truth of Scripture rather than bracket it. His apologetic method, expressed in lectures and pastoral counsel, resists evidentialist attempts to place the unbeliever as judge over God and aligns with the **antithetical** stance of classic Reformed apologetics. In this respect he positions himself against more evidentialist or classical approaches while echoing Westminster’s historical identity as the home of **presuppositionalism**.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Peter Lillback very intentionally positions himself as a defender and continuer of **Reformed orthodoxy**, especially as articulated at **Westminster Seminary** by **Machen**, **Murray**, and **Van Til**. His work on Calvin and covenant theology reinforces **Bavinck’s** and **Vos’s** insistence on the organic unity of Reformed thought from Reformation through orthodoxy, and it counteracts narratives that pit Calvin against the later Reformed scholastics. In this he stands with **Richard Muller** and others who show the continuity between Calvin and figures like **Turretin**. Classical Reformed theologians would find much to applaud in Lillback’s high view of **Scripture**, his commitment to confessional standards, his affirmation of a full **federal theology**, and his insistence on Christ’s Lordship over every sphere of life.

At the same time, Westminster examiners will note certain pressure points. First, his **church–state** and **American founding** work, while helpful as historical correction, can be perceived as flirting with a kind of Christian nationalism if not carefully qualified. A Reformed examiner will insist that the church must not sacralize any nation, and that **American constitutionalism** is not normative revelation. Second, his strong identification with a particular institutional trajectory of **Westminster** and the **PCA** means that his voice must be distinguished from the broader catholic Reformed tradition; the confessional standards, not any one seminary president, are the doctrinal norm. Students may also be tempted to treat his reading of **Calvin** and covenant as the last word, whereas Reformed orthodoxy welcomes ongoing detailed exegesis and historical work.

Nonetheless, there are clearly areas where Reformed theologians can learn from Lillback. His close reading of **Calvin** on covenant, and his defense of the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** framework, buttress confessional preaching and catechesis in an age confused about law, gospel, and assurance. His pastoral emphasis on confessional fidelity, expository preaching, and the ordinary **means of grace** provides a needed counterweight to both therapeutic and entertainment driven models of ministry. Furthermore, his insistence that Christians bring a consciously Christian mind to **law**, **politics**, and **culture** helps prevent a retreatist or pietistic withdrawal from public life, even as examiners will urge careful distinctions to avoid confusing the two kingdoms or undermining the spirituality of the church.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, safe opening lines about Peter Lillback would emphasize his confessional and covenantal commitments. One might say, for instance, that Peter Lillback is a contemporary Reformed theologian and churchman who labors to show that classic **covenant theology** and **Westminster confessionalism** are not only faithful to Calvin but also vital for pastoral ministry and cultural engagement today. It is also safe to note that as a student and later colleague of **Van Til**, he extends a presuppositional epistemology into questions of history, politics, and public theology. You can confidently underscore his rejection of liberal theology, his defense of Scripture’s inerrancy and sufficiency, and his insistence on the Lordship of **Christ over culture**.

There are, however, phrases that must be handled with care. You should avoid unqualified talk of **Christian America** or **reclaiming America for Christ** when describing his work on church and state. Instead, frame his argument as a critique of secularist misuse of **Jefferson’s wall of separation** and as an attempt to restore a historically grounded understanding of **religious liberty** compatible with a robust public witness. You should also avoid suggesting that his reading of Calvin proves that Calvin explicitly taught the fully developed **covenant of works** as articulated later in the **Westminster Confession**. Rather, say that Lillback argues Calvin’s thought is structurally and materially in line with later covenant theology, which undercuts sharp Calvin versus federalist dichotomies. Do not imply any sympathy in Lillback for nonconfessional or revisionist tendencies such as **open theism**, **egalitarianism as a doctrinal principle**, or rejection of inerrancy, since his posture is precisely the opposite.

Examiners may exploit misunderstandings that students bring to Lillback’s work. Some may overestimate his originality, as if he created covenant theology, instead of seeing him as a historical theologian clarifying **Calvin’s** role. Others may confuse his strong cultural engagement with an endorsement of a theocratic state; here you must stress that he does not advocate a **state church**, but rather a public square where Christian truth claims are not artificially excluded. A further trap would be to frame him as primarily a political activist because of his public work; you should correct this by noting his primary identity as a **pastor**, **historical theologian**, and **seminary president** in the Reformed confessional tradition. Finally, students sometimes mention Lillback only as a WTS administrator; examiners may press you to show awareness of **The Binding of God** and of his historical arguments about Calvin, so tie his institutional leadership back to his convictions about **covenant**, **Scripture**, and **confession**.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Peter Lillback is to be appreciated as a consciously Reformed, confessionally anchored theologian whose work on **Calvin and covenant**, his Van Tilian approach to **revelation and reason**, and his call for robust public Christian witness strengthen the church’s grasp of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**; we affirm his defense of the **federal schema**, his insistence on the primacy of **Scripture** and the binding character of the **Westminster Standards**, and his rejection of liberal and pragmatist dilutions of the faith, while we must deny any implication that American constitutional arrangements possess theological normativity or that Christian cultural engagement licenses a blurring of the distinction between church and state, and so if asked where I land I would say that I uphold with Lillback the centrality of covenant theology and confessional fidelity for doctrine and ministry, yet I would carefully distinguish principled public theology from any sacralization of nation or culture, keeping Christ’s kingdom, as confessed in our Standards, supreme over every earthly polity.
