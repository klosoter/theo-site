### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Benjamin P. Laird emerges within a **contemporary Evangelical** conversation that insists the **New Testament canon** is not a late ecclesial overlay but the apostolic church’s normative archive. His work is situated after the canonical turn of **Brevard Childs**, the sociological studies of **Harry Y. Gamble**, and the early collection thesis of **David Trobisch**. Laird’s distinctive thesis is that a historically responsible **canonical criticism** can and must include the concrete mechanics of **authorial publication**, **co-senders and amanuenses**, and the editorial protocols that produced a **Pauline corpus** read as **graphai**. The result is a method that refuses a dichotomy between **history** and **canon**, that draws on epigraphic evidence and ancient epistolary conventions, and that reads Paul’s letters within the literary frame supplied by **Acts** and the **canonical order** of the New Testament. Theologically, he adopts an Evangelical **regula fidei** and **analogia fidei** posture, correlating historical reconstruction with a confessional claim about **inspiration** and **apostolicity**.

A crucial methodological plank in Laird’s work is the retrieval of **prosopography**. Paul’s letters name **co-senders** such as **Sosthenes**, **Timothy**, and **Silvanus**, and they identify intermediaries, couriers, and at least one **amanuensis**, **Tertius** in Romans 16.22. For Laird, these names are not incidental marginalia. They attest to a collaborative apostolic economy of word and witness that shaped **composition**, **authentication**, and **circulation**. By pressing these historical particulars, Laird contests generic claims about anonymous pseudepigraphy and pushes toward a communal profile of Pauline authorship that is compatible with **verba Dei** and the social fact of early **catholicity**.

#### 2. Major works and the canonical thesis
Laird’s program comes to a head in **Creating Paul: The Canonical Shaping of the Apostle’s Identity** 2022. The core claim is straightforward and provocative. The **canonical order** and literary frame of the New Testament do not merely bind disparate documents. They form a deliberate interpretive matrix that constructs a public **canonical Paul**. The narrative of **Acts** supplies the aperture that renders intelligible the geographical, communal, and theological horizons presupposed in the Pauline letters, and the order and grouping of those letters within the **Pauline corpus** further articulate the apostle’s mission to the nations. For Laird, the canon is not a neutral container but a crafted book that is itself a theological argument about **apostolicity**, **mission**, and **ecclesial unity**.

This canonical thesis relies on detailed arguments about **order and grouping**. Laird highlights the collection of letters to churches, from **Romans** to **2 Thessalonians**, typically ordered by length, followed by letters to individuals, **1–2 Timothy**, **Titus**, and **Philemon**. He notes the long-standing ambiguity of **Hebrews**, variously located alongside or after Paul in ancient lists, as evidence of an early editorial consciousness about **attribution** and **doctrinal coherence**. He reads these arrangements with attention to subscriptional data, paratextual features such as titles and colophons, and the second-century consolidation of collections attested by the **Muratorian Fragment**. Laird carefully resists an overdeveloped typology of redactional intentions, yet he argues that the clustering and sequence were sufficiently deliberate to sustain theological claims about the **Pauline mission** as the public extension of the **apostolic kerygma**.

#### 3. Publication, collection, and early reception
The social mechanics of **publication and collection** are central to Laird’s reconstruction. Drawing on analogues from Greco-Roman letter collections and on Christian practices evidenced in **Colossians 4.16** and **2 Peter 3.15–16**, he contends that Paul’s letters were copied, exchanged, and gathered with surprising rapidity. The reference to Paul’s letters as **graphai** in **2 Peter 3.16**, whatever one’s judgments on authorship of 2 Peter, indicates that by late first or early second century, there existed a recognizable corpus with scriptural status. Laird places **couriers** such as **Phoebe** and **Tychicus** within this process, treating them as authorized agents whose service extends beyond delivery to instruction in the reception of the letter. The presence of **amanuenses** and **co-senders** likewise implies a communal accountability structure that supports early **canonical consciousness**.

Within this account, Laird engages the specter of **Marcion**. He agrees that the mid-second-century Marcionite collection, which privileged an edited version of Luke and ten Pauline letters, shows the power of a curated canon. Yet he insists Marcion did not invent a corpus ex nihilo. The church’s rejection of Marcion presupposes the church’s own trajectory of collecting and evaluating the **Pauline corpus**, a trajectory already evident in the circulation patterns and intertextual awareness of the sub-apostolic age. Here Laird draws on studies of **early Christian book culture** by **Larry Hurtado** and the sociology of reading by **Harry Gamble**, using their data to argue for early and wide dissemination of codices that favored collection and cross-assembly reading.

#### 4. Authorship, pseudepigraphy, and ethical contours
Laird’s Evangelical posture surfaces sharply in his treatment of **pseudepigraphy**. Against the now-standard bifurcation of the **Pauline corpus** into undisputed, disputed, and pseudonymous letters, he contends that early Christian moral judgments render routine pseudonymous authorship implausible for canonical letters. He invokes **Tertullian’s** outrage at the **Acts of Paul and Thecla**, where a presbyter was deposed for forging a Pauline narrative, as evidence that pseudonymity was not a neutral literary device but a deception incompatible with apostolic authority. He cites the **Muratorian Fragment’s** rejection of spurious letters and the pastoral logic of **1 Timothy** and **Titus** to argue that the church would not authorize pseudonymous instruction in the very documents that police doctrine and order.

This argument is not simply a moralizing addendum. It is a corollary of Laird’s **canonical construction**. If the **canonical order** functions as a theological frame, the authenticity of its witnesses sustains the coherence of the frame. Laird therefore revisits arguments for the authenticity of **Ephesians**, **Colossians**, **2 Thessalonians**, and the **Pastorals**, probing lexical, stylistic, and contextual claims. He accents the roles of **co-senders** and **amanuenses** to account for stylistic variation without invoking pseudonymity. He also foregrounds the plausibility of late-Pauline ministry scenarios that fit the **Pastorals**, especially given the open-ended conclusion of **Acts** and the travel possibilities reflected in **Titus** and **2 Timothy**. The upshot is an integrated case for a continuous Pauline voice across the canon recognized by the early church.

#### 5. Acts as canonical frame and the making of a public Paul
Laird’s most distinctive move is to treat **Acts** as a canonical preface to the **Pauline corpus**. He argues that **Luke’s historiography** supplies a narrative architecture that supplies the public coordinates for reading Paul’s letters. The speeches in **Acts**, the travel itineraries, and the depiction of disputes such as the **Jerusalem Council** in Acts 15 provide communal and theological context for matters presupposed in **Galatians**, **Romans**, and **1 Corinthians**. This does not render Acts an extrinsic control on Paul. It names the literary ecology in which the church received Paul, so that the canonical arrangement functions as an intentional invitation to read epistles through narrative memory. In this sense, the church did not merely receive letters. It curated a **Paul** who was both apostle and character, whose mission is legible within the **apostolic history** and the **catholic order** of the canon.

Such an account shifts the weight of interpretive authority toward **canonical sequence**. Laird is careful to avoid a naive harmonization. He grants that **Acts** and the letters reflect different genres and rhetorical aims. Yet he resists a powerfully isolationist reading of Paul that treats the epistles as free-floating occasional tracts. By elevating the canonical architecture, Laird places **Romans** at the head of the church letters not only as the longest but as a de facto theological prologue, and he notes how the subsequent ordering guides readers from Rome back into the Aegean and Asia Minor, retracing lines that the narrative of **Acts** had already mapped. In short, the order itself participates in the theological construction of **Paul’s mission to the nations**.

#### 6. Co-senders, amanuenses, and the ecclesial shape of authorship
Laird’s emphasis on **co-senders and amanuenses** functions as more than an explanatory device for stylistic anomalies. It is a constructive account of **ecclesial authorship** that respects **apostolic primacy**. Co-senders such as **Timothy**, **Silvanus**, and **Sosthenes** appear not as courtesy names but as partners whose names authenticate letters for particular communities and whose presence may reflect joint deliberation and pastoral agency. The **amanuensis** functions as a trained scribe who can execute stylistic decisions under direction, as seen in ancient epistolary practice. The mixture of greetings, travel plans, and commendations of couriers points to a networked apostolic enterprise in which **letters as public documents** were crafted by teams and then entrusted to recognized carriers like **Phoebe** and **Tychicus** who could answer questions in person.

This ecclesial account reinforces Laird’s thesis that the **Pauline corpus** was born from missionary practice that already anticipated **collection**. The instruction in **Colossians 4.16** to read and exchange letters signals an expectation of wider circulation beyond a single locale. The explicit authorial markers such as Paul’s own hand noted in **Galatians 6.11** suggest practices of verification. All of this supports the claim that the early church’s eventual **canonization** of Paul’s letters was not a post hoc accretion but an amplification of patterns Paul himself encouraged. Theologically, the collaborative dynamics of authorship cohere with the **koinonia** of the churches and the **catholicity** of the apostolic witness.

#### 7. Canon, theology, and the shape of Pauline doctrine
Though primarily a historian of texts, Laird’s work carries doctrinal implications for **bibliology** and **ecclesiology**. By insisting that the **canonical order** constructs a public **Paul**, he invites readers to attend to the coherence of **apostolic doctrine** across letters and to the integrity of **regula fidei** as an interpretive norm arising from the texts themselves. The sequence from **Romans** to **Philemon**, framed by **Acts**, not only situates topics such as **justification**, **union with Christ**, **ecclesial unity**, and **mission**. It renders them communal goods, governed by the apostolic pattern of teaching transmitted to trustworthy people. The presence of the **Pastorals** at the end of the Pauline corpus underscores the forward-looking institutionalization of doctrine in overseers and deacons, binding together **orthodoxy** and **order**.

Laird also shows how the **canonical Paul** interacts with the rest of the New Testament. The proximity to the **Catholic Epistles** draws attention to convergences between **Paul** and **James**, or **Paul** and **Peter**, and prevents the isolation of a supposed Pauline school detached from apostolic consensus. The arrangement thus supports the church’s confession that Scripture speaks with **one voice** through diverse witnesses. In this way, the canonical arrangement does not mute the occasional nature of epistles but integrates them into a comprehensive **apostolic testimony** whose center is the **Christ event**, narrated in the Gospels and explicated by letters that bear the seal of **graphai**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates
Laird’s proposals engage several scholarly axes. With **Bart D. Ehrman**, he disputes the normalcy and theological acceptability of **pseudepigraphy** in the canonical letters, pressing patristic evidence and the ethics of truth. With **David Trobisch**, he shares the conviction that a discrete **Pauline letter collection** emerged early, though Laird places more weight on communal production and less on a single editorial moment. With **Harry Y. Gamble** and **Larry W. Hurtado**, he appropriates the material history of books to show why codices favored the consolidation of corpora and the **public reading** of Scripture. With **Brevard S. Childs**, he agrees that canonical form bears theological authority, yet he grounds this claim in the historicized particulars of **co-senders**, **amanuenses**, and couriers that bind canonical form to apostolic practice.

Critics worry that treating **Acts** as a canonical frame risks subordinating Paul’s letters to a theological narrative that may smooth over tensions. Laird acknowledges the danger and calls for disciplined intertextual reading that honors genre and authorial intent. Others question whether the order of letters by length can bear the theological weight he assigns. Laird replies that order and grouping are never simply formal, pointing to the cumulative effect of sequence, paratexts, and early usage as they shape ecclesial reading habits. In each case, the debate turns on how far one can press **canonical form** as a theological guide without collapsing historical contingency into editorial intent.

#### 9. Significance for Evangelical theology and Reformed reception
For Evangelical theology, Laird’s work offers a textured account of **canon formation** that underwrites confidence in **apostolic authorship**, **inspiration**, and the early recognition of **graphai**. His portrait of **ecclesial authorship** through **co-senders and amanuenses** nuances simplistic appeals to single-author models without weakening claims about divine and human concurrence. By showing how the **canonical order** constructs a public **Paul**, he furnishes hermeneutical guidance that aligns doctrinal synthesis with the church’s received book, not with reconstructions that fracture apostolic unity. The result is a vision of Scripture as a covenantal archive whose structure participates in its message about **mission**, **holiness**, and **unity in Christ**.

Reformed and Westminster Seminary readers will find much to commend. Laird’s defense of **apostolic authorship**, antipathy to **pseudepigraphy**, and appeal to early **catholic reception** resonate with **covenantal canon**, **organic inspiration**, and the **self-authenticating Scripture** emphasis articulated by **Michael J. Kruger** and others. Yet a WTS evaluation will register cautions. First, the weight placed on **Acts as metanarrative frame** can obscure the **redemptive-historical** primacy of Christ and covenant if the narrative function becomes a controlling grid rather than a ministerial guide. Second, the theological freight assigned to **canonical sequence** requires restraint. The Reformed alternative is to privilege the intrinsic **covenantal unity of special revelation**, the principial sufficiency of the **autopistos** character of Scripture, and the **analogia fidei** informed by covenant and union with Christ, while receiving Laird’s insights as prudential aids rather than as constitutive norms. In sum, the Reformed critique does not reject the canonical thesis. It subordinates sequence and paratext to the triune Lord’s self-attesting Word, while welcoming Laird’s historically rich account of how the church learned to read **Paul** as Scripture.
