### ESSAY
Terrance Tiessen’s work belongs to the generation of evangelical theologians who took up classical **Reformed orthodoxy** within the crucible of late twentieth-century debates about **divine providence** and **religious pluralism**. Teaching for decades in Canadian evangelical institutions, notably at Providence Theological Seminary in Manitoba, he wrote for a broad **evangelical** readership while arguing from within a **Reformed** grammar of **unconditional election** and **compatibilist freedom**. His hallmark is methodological: he builds explicit models that test exegetical claims by their ability to integrate doctrines across loci, especially **providence**, **prayer**, and **mission**. Scripture is the control, yet he appropriates the conceptual idiom of **analytic philosophy of religion** to clarify the logical ordering of the **divine decree** and the relations between **natural knowledge**, *scientia media*, and **free knowledge**. Tiessen’s posture is neither scholastic repristination nor free speculation; it is a consciously **biblical-practical systematics** that treats **petitionary prayer** and the fate of the **unevangelized** as dogmatic pressure points where theology must show its pastoral utility.

The intellectual context of his mature work was defined by the rise of **open theism** and the reassessment of **Molinism** as a live option in analytic circles. Figures like **Clark Pinnock** and **John Sanders** pressed the case that divine **omniscience** is dynamic and that risk lies within God’s relation to the world, while philosophers like **William Lane Craig** defended **middle knowledge** to preserve exhaustive foreknowledge with libertarian freedom. Tiessen rejects **open theism**, insisting on **immutability**, **impassibility** in the properly qualified sense, and **meticulous providence**, yet he also rejects simple appeal to mystery where finer-grained account is possible. He therefore adapts **Molinist** categories not to soften sovereignty but to model how **God’s exhaustive foreordination** can include the genuine significance of **creaturely petitions** and **contingent histories**. His wager is clear: **Molinist tools** can be wielded in **Reformed** hands without sacrificing the **decree** or collapsing responsibility.

The programmatic statement of this wager is **Providence and Prayer** 2000, a book that first canvasses an array of models of **divine providence** and then proposes a constructive alternative. He charts positions ranging from **deism** to **process theism**, through **open theism**, **Arminian synergism**, classical **Thomism**, standard **Calvinism**, and various **Molinist** and hybrid views, evaluating each by its account of **petitionary prayer**. Prayer functions as a test case because it implicates metaphysics of causality and providence, the efficacy of means, and the sincerity of divine invitations. Against accounts that make prayer merely expressive and against indeterminist models that fracture divine governance, Tiessen argues for a **Calvinist use of middle knowledge**. God knows what would happen under any array of circumstances, and he ordains a world whose history is structured by the genuine efficacy of **ordained means**, including the free prayers of the saints. In this selection of a world, God takes account of the counterfactuals of creaturely actions and supplications. The result is a model where **prayer changes things** as a divinely appointed instrument within an exhaustively **foreordained** history.

Crucial for the plausibility of this proposal are Tiessen’s moves regarding **compatibilist freedom** and the structure of divine knowledge. He affirms a standard Reformed account of freedom as doing what one most wants, with the will inclined by nature and grace, thus rejecting **libertarian indeterminism**. He then employs *scientia media* not as a concession to creaturely self-determination but as a logical tool for handling **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom**. God knows, by a mode of knowledge logically ordered with respect to the decree, what any possible creaturely agent would do in any possible set of circumstances. Tiessen departs from Jesuit **Molinism** by grounding the truth of counterfactuals in God’s comprehensive ordination of natures and circumstances rather than in autonomous creaturely acts. The knowledge is middle by logical relation, not by an ontic limitation on **sovereignty**. On this account, the grounding of counterfactuals does not lie outside God. God decrees which web of counterfactuals becomes actual and he decrees it precisely through his perfect knowledge of what those agents would do as embedded in that world. The payoff is a thoroughly **meticulous providence** that preserves the instrumental role of **prayer** without conceding a single square inch of the terrain to **open theism**.

The other pillar of Tiessen’s contribution is **Who Can Be Saved?** 2004, where he addresses the fate of the **unevangelized** under the banner of **solus Christus** and **sola gratia**. He distinguishes carefully between **restrictivism**, which insists on explicit knowledge of the gospel for salvation, **pluralism**, which denies the uniqueness of Christ, and **inclusivism**, which affirms Christ’s uniqueness while allowing salvation beyond explicit Christian confession. Tiessen advocates what he calls **Reformed accessibilism**. Salvation is always and only in union with **Christ** by the **Spirit**, grounded in **particular election**, yet the Spirit is not limited in every case to the ordinary paths of **special revelation** mediated by the **church**. God may regenerate the elect and elicit saving trust in himself through the light of **general revelation** and providential encounters such that faith is implicitly directed to the God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ even when the name of Jesus is not yet known. He treats the pre-Christian saints in **Hebrews 11**, the case of **Melchizedek**, the God-fearer **Cornelius** in Acts 10 before Peter’s sermon, and the logic of **Romans 1–2** as exegetical warrant for the possibility that God grants saving grace outside the normal missionary matrix.

Tiessen’s **accessibilism** is neither universalist nor a capitulation to **religious pluralism**. He denies that non-Christian religions are salvific paths; he denies that all are saved; he insists that **faith** is a gift of **grace** and that the **Spirit** unites to **Christ** alone. Yet he stresses that God is free to use **general revelation**, **dreams and visions**, and extraordinary providences to bring an elect person into a saving relation to Christ where ordinary means are absent. Theologically, this maintains **particularism** in **election** while answering concerns about the justice and mercy of God toward those who never hear the gospel. Pastorally, he guards the urgency of **mission** by arguing that explicit gospel proclamation remains the normative means by which God saves, confers assurance, builds churches, and deepens sanctification. Missional urgency is not weakened, Tiessen contends, because what is exceptional cannot be presumed, and because **Romans 10** ties calling on the Lord to the **preaching** of Christ. The model preserves the logic of the **Great Commission** while refusing to constrain the **Spirit’s** freedom.

Exegetically and dogmatically, Tiessen deploys a network of **Reformed** commitments to support both pillars. For **providence and prayer**, he appeals to the biblical pattern of **means-and-ends concursus** evident in texts like **James 5** on Elijah’s prayer, **Daniel 9** on Daniel’s petition grounded in the prophetic word, and **Ephesians 1** on the counsel of God who works all things according to his will. This pattern aligns with **Westminster**-style confessional claims about second causes and the necessity of prayer as an appointed instrument. For **salvation and the unevangelized**, he integrates **Romans 9–11** on **election**, **Romans 1–2** on general revelation and conscience, **Acts 17** on God’s providential ordering of nations that they should seek him, and **Hebrews 11** on the faith of those who trusted the promises without seeing their fulfillment. The Spirit who applies redemption *ad intra* the church can, by divine prerogative, apply it beyond the church’s visible ministry *ad extra*, though this is extraordinary and opaque to human judgment. Tiessen’s use of *scientia media* then functions as a scaffolding for both tasks: it explains how God can ordain in detail a world that includes efficacious prayers and extraordinary salvific providences, without any compromise of **meticulous sovereignty**.

Controversy follows naturally from such a project, and Tiessen engages critics with care. **Paul Helm** challenges the coherence and necessity of **middle knowledge** within a robust **Augustinian** framework, arguing that the classical distinction between **natural** and **free knowledge** already suffices, that **truthmakers** for counterfactuals are suspect, and that adding a logical moment risks multiplying entities without gain. **William Lane Craig** acknowledges common ground yet judges Tiessen’s compatibilist appropriation as no longer properly **Molinist**, since it rejects libertarian freedom as the ground of counterfactual truth. From another angle, **Clark Pinnock** and **John Sanders** argue that Tiessen’s model does not take seriously the risk and openness conveyed by Scripture’s narrative of divine interaction, and that **open theism** better underwrites the prudence and urgency of **prayer**. Tiessen’s reply is consistent across fronts. He claims that **compatibilist freedom** is sufficient for moral responsibility and that the biblical God is never in ontological risk. He contends that the **grounding** of counterfactuals lies in God’s ordination of creaturely essences and settings, so there is no rogue realm of truth independent of **divine aseity**. He insists that Scripture itself treats prayer as a genuine means under divine sovereignty rather than as a negotiation with an uncertain deity.

The constructive synthesis suggests a single through-line in Tiessen’s theology. He seeks to articulate a **unified doctrine of God** and **salvation** in which divine **omniscience**, **omnipotence**, and **goodness** are harmonized with the meaningfulness of **human action**, whether in **prayer** or in the responsive trust of persons without ordinary access to the gospel. **Middle knowledge** functions as a heuristic that allows him to describe the logical contour of God’s decree without eroding either the freedom of God or the accountability of creatures. **Accessibilism** extends that same instinct to the soteriological edge case of the **unevangelized**. The backbone remains thoroughly **Reformed**: **total depravity** that requires **effectual calling**, **particular redemption** in **Christ**, and the **perseverance of the saints** under **meticulous providence**. The pastoral face is practical and consolatory. Christians should pray with boldness because God has ordained their prayers as real instruments of his ends, and they should evangelize urgently while trusting that God is not handcuffed by geographical or historical barriers in the execution of **electing grace**.

A final word is necessary regarding reception and evaluation within confessional **Reformed** and **Westminster** circles. Many have appreciated Tiessen’s exegetical seriousness, his defense of **meticulous providence** against **open theism**, and his heartfelt commitment to **solus Christus** in the theology of religions. Yet caution abides. Classical **Reformed scholasticism** in **Turretin** and **Bavinck** rejected *scientia media* as an unnecessary and destabilizing third moment that imperils divine **simplicity** by suggesting a compositional layering in **God’s knowledge**, and that risks positing contingent truths not grounded directly in the **decree**. From a **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage that prizes the primacy of **special revelation**, the finality of **Christ’s mediatorial office**, and the ordinary **means of grace**, Tiessen’s **accessibilism** must be disciplined by the confessional pattern that the Spirit ordinarily works by the Word read and preached, with any extraordinary working treated as rare and untheorized rather than generalized into a soteriological pathway through **general revelation**. An alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would retain **asymmetrical divine concurrence**, strong **secondary causality**, and a robust doctrine of **covenant of grace**, securing the efficacy of **prayer** as a decreed means and maintaining missionary urgency, without recourse to **middle knowledge**. On this reading, Tiessen’s project is a brave and often illuminating attempt to clarify difficult interfaces, but the safer Reformed path keeps the twofold knowledge of God, deepens **concursus**, and restricts claims about the **unevangelized** to the confessional category of the **Spirit’s** extraordinary work where and when he pleases, while doubling down on **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **mission** as the appointed economy of grace.
