### TITLE
Wolfhart Pannenberg is the paradigmatic twentieth–century theologian who relocates all dogmatics into the public court of universal history, gaining critical rigor but dissolving classical Reformed confidence in inscripturated revelation and the finished work of Christ.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Born 1928 in Stettin and teaching mainly in **Heidelberg** and **Munich**, **Wolfhart Pannenberg** stands in the post–World War II German context shaped by **Heidegger**, **Bultmann**, and late **Barth**.
- He belongs to the movement of post–**Bultmann** revisionist theology, engaging **philosophy of history**, **critical realism**, and **secularization** debates from the 1960s through the early twenty–first century.

- His method is a universal **history-of-revelation** project, arguing that **God** and theological truth are knowable only through the historical process culminating in eschatological consummation.
- He employs a form of critical **reason** and **public rationality**, insisting that Christian truth claims must be argued in a way accessible to believers and unbelievers in the same historical evidence.
- Revelation is treated as the **self-disclosure of God in universal history**, not primarily as a set of infallible **biblical propositions**, and theology is done in conversation with **Kant**, **Hegel**, and **the sciences**.

- In **Revelation as History** (1961, ed. with **Rendtorff** and **Weiss**), he rejects a purely interior or kerygmatic account of revelation and argues for history as the proper locus of **revelation**.
- In **Jesus – God and Man** (1964), he develops his programmatic **Christology from below**, claiming that Jesus deity is knowable only through the historical event and evidential force of the **resurrection**.
- In **Theology and the Philosophy of Science** (1973), he articulates his critical realist **method**, pressing for theology to function as a rational hypothesis about reality within the academy.
- In his three–volume **Systematic Theology** (1988–1993), he offers a comprehensive construction where **eschatology**, **Trinity**, **creation**, and **anthropology** are all determined by the notion of history as the field of **Gods** self–revelation.

- He is decisive for modern discussions of **revelation and history**, especially debates on the historical **resurrection** and the public status of dogma.
- He significantly shapes contemporary **Trinity** and **eschatology**, proposing that Gods triunity is known only in the eschatological consummation of **history**.
- His account of **Christology** and **resurrection** remains a key foil for evangelical and Reformed treatments of historical apologetics.
- He influences ecclesial reflection on **church and culture**, since the church is read as an anticipatory sign of universal **eschatological** reconciliation.

- From a **Reformed** exam angle, you must affirm his insistence on the public, historical reality of the **resurrection** and his critique of private experiential **revelation**.
- You must sharply contest his relativizing of **Scripture** under universal history, his tentative approach to **eschaton** and assurance, and his tendency toward an open **universalism**.

- Comparison handles include **Pannenberg vs Barth** on whether **revelation** is identical with the person of Christ or mediated through universal history.
- Another crucial handle is **Pannenberg vs Van Til** on the interpretation of **history**, epistemic authority, and the principial role of **Scripture**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Wolfhart **Pannenberg**, born in 1928 in Stettin, came of age amid the intellectual and cultural devastation of postwar Germany, where the collapse of **National Socialism** discredited both cultural Protestantism and naive appeals to natural theology. Educated in **Berlin**, **Gottingen**, and **Basel**, he studied under figures like **Karl Barth** and engaged deeply with **Heidegger** and **Bultmann**, yet was dissatisfied with both existential reduction of faith and purely kerygmatic theology. His early involvement with the group that produced **Offenbarung als Geschichte** Revelation as History in 1961 marks his decisive break with **Bultmannian** demythologizing and his lifelong concern with history as the locus of Gods self–disclosure. The driving problem of his theology is how claims about **God** and Jesus Christ can be publicly justified in a late modern context shaped by **Kantian** skepticism about metaphysics and by historical criticism of Scripture.

For Pannenberg, the central question is whether Christian **dogma** can be more than an inward decision or community language game and instead function as rationally arguable truth about reality. He fears that both **Barthian** actualism and liberal historicism sever theology from the shared world of critical inquiry and science. His answer is to propose a rigorously historical, evidential, and universal account of **revelation**, in which all truth claims, including theological ones, must be open to critical assessment in the court of universal history. This leads him to the programmatic thesis that the truth of Christian doctrine, including the deity of **Christ**, is provisionally grounded in the historical event of the resurrection and finally verifiable only at the eschatological consummation of history.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Pannenbergs method, as seen in **Revelation as History** and later in **Theology and the Philosophy of Science**, is a self–conscious attempt to make theology a public science alongside other disciplines. He rejects **Schleiermacher** and much liberal theology for grounding religion in feeling or immediate consciousness, and he criticizes **Barth** for turning **revelation** into an event entirely self–authenticating within the churchs proclamation. For Pannenberg, revelation is not primarily a private experience or a supranatural incursion, but the self–manifestation of **God** in the totality of history. He insists that God does not reveal isolated propositions but discloses his deity and will through the historical process whose meaning is grasped retrospectively and proleptically toward the **eschaton**.

Scripture in Pannenbergs method is thus a privileged historical witness but not the immediate form of **revelation** in the Reformed confessional sense. The **Bible** records decisive events and interpretations within Israels and the churchs history, yet its authority is mediated by the larger framework of universal history within which it is situated. In his **Systematic Theology**, he repeatedly claims that the truth of Scripture is confirmed and corrected by the unfolding of **history** as Gods field of action. This stands in sharp contrast to the Reformed pattern of **Calvin** and **Bavinck**, where Scripture is the principium cognoscendi, the foundational cognitive principle, by which history is interpreted. Pannenberg reverses this order and makes Scripture one historically conditioned witness within a broader horizon of rational historical inquiry.

Reason and experience function for Pannenberg in a critical realist way, drawing on **Kant**, **Hegel**, and **Dilthey**, yet aiming to overcome their limitations. He argues that human **reason** operates always historically, forming hypotheses about reality that are open to revision by new data. Theology, on his view, is such a hypothesis about the totality of reality, namely that the **God** who raised Jesus from the dead is the ultimate ground of all things. Religious experience is not an independent source of knowledge, but the internal correlate of Gods historical action, so experience never stands over against **history** but is shaped by it. The church has no privileged epistemic standpoint in principle, only a historically formed anticipation of the final meaning of events, and its creed is a provisional conceptualization that remains open to correction by future historical developments.

This method creates deep tension with classical Reformed commitments to **revelation** as an authoritative, completed act inscripturated in the canon. For Pannenberg, the meaning of Gods revelation cannot be fully fixed until the end of **history**, which means present dogmatic formulations are inherently revisable. Assurance of faith is therefore, in his program, a rationally responsible risk based on the best available historical evidence, particularly concerning the **resurrection**, but not a resting in Gods already finished Word as confessed by **Turretin** and defended by **Van Til**. The Reformed emphasis on the internal testimony of the **Holy Spirit** and on Scripture as self–authenticating is replaced by public historical argument and openness to possible future falsification.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline holds that God reveals himself savingly in the history of redemption, yet this revelation is definitively and infallibly inscripturated in the canonical **Scriptures**, which function as the final norm for doctrine and life. Pannenberg reframes this in **Revelation as History** 1961 and in his **Systematic Theology I** 1988 by asserting that revelation is nothing other than the self–disclosure of **God** in the totality of universal history, with special focus on Israel and Jesus. Scripture is authoritative only as the paradigmatic interpretation of Gods acts, and its truth is always subject to critical historical examination and the wider movement of **history**. Interlocutors like **Bultmann** and later **Pannenberg** critics such as **Moltmann** challenge his insistence on public, rational verification, yet Pannenberg maintains that theology must make claims that could in principle be falsified. A Reformed examiner will insist by contrast with **Calvin** and **Bavinck** that Gods revelation is complete in Christ and canon and that history is to be read through Scripture, not Scripture through an open–ended horizon of history.

Second, in **Christology and resurrection**, Reformed orthodoxy confesses, following **Chalcedon**, that Jesus Christ is one person in two natures, true God and true man, whose deity is not inferred from historical evidence but is ontologically given and confessed in faith grounded on the authoritative **Word**. In **Jesus – God and Man** 1964, Pannenberg proposes a Christology from below, beginning with the historical Jesus and arguing that only the resurrection event vindicates Jesus claim to represent the **kingdom of God** and discloses his deity. The resurrection is treated as a historically accessible event that functions as proleptic revelation of the eschatological future in the middle of **history**. Dialogue partners such as **Ernst Kasemann** and later evangelical critics like **N. T. Wright** engage his evidential approach. While Pannenberg robustly defends the bodily resurrection against demythologizing, he tends to render Jesus divine sonship a conclusion of historical argument rather than a given of apostolic **revelation**, raising questions for Reformed confessions about the primacy of Gods self–attestation in Scripture over the court of historical criticism.

Third, in the doctrine of the **Trinity** and eschatology, the Reformed baseline, represented by **Aquinas** appropriated and clarified by **Bavinck**, affirms that Gods eternal triune life is fully real and known from Scripture, while eschatology is the historical consummation of what is already complete in **God**. Pannenberg reverses the order by making the divine identity itself eschatologically determined. In **Systematic Theology I–III** 1988–1993, he argues that the triunity of God cannot be fully identified apart from the completion of Gods rule over all **history**. The Father, Son, and Spirit are known in and through their historical roles in creation and reconciliation, and only when God is all in all will Gods triunity be definitively manifested. Interlocutors include **Rahner** and **Moltmann**, yet Pannenberg maintains a more rigorously historical approach than either. From a Reformed standpoint, this tends to render the **Trinity** dependent on history and makes Gods inner life partially contingent on the outcome of the world process, which conflicts with classical doctrines of divine **aseity** and immutability.

Fourth, in the area of **anthropology** and church–world relations, Reformed theology confesses that humanity is created in the **image of God**, fallen in Adam, and renewed in Christ, with the church as the distinct covenant community gathered around Word and sacrament yet called to engage culture under the Lordship of Christ. Pannenberg, particularly in his **Anthropology in Theological Perspective** 1985 and in **Systematic Theology II**, interprets humanity as essentially oriented toward the future and toward participation in Gods universal **kingdom**. Human identity is constituted eschatologically, so that the self is always a project open to the future of God. The church, in his vision, is a proleptic sign of the universal reconciliation of humanity in **Christ**, but it does not monopolize salvation and remains permeable to broader cultural developments. Here his interlocutors include **Bonhoeffer** and **Habermas**, as he reflects on public reason and secular society. While Reformed thinkers can appreciate his emphasis on eschatological hope and public engagement, his universalizing tendencies and downplaying of the antithesis between **church** and world undermine the sharp covenantal boundaries central to a Westminster ecclesiology.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians such as **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck** would strongly contest Pannenbergs relocation of the principial norm from Scripture to universal **history**. For them, **revelation** is a completed divine act inscripturated in the canon, and the task of theology is to receive and systematize that Word within the church. Pannenbergs insistence that all dogma must remain open to revision in light of new historical understanding directly conflicts with Reformed doctrines of the sufficiency and perspicuity of **Scripture**. Moreover, his eschatologically conditioned doctrine of **God**, in which the divine identity is tied to the final triumph of Gods rule in history, stands at odds with the Reformed stress on Gods eternal, self–sufficient life as confessed in **Westminster Confession** chapter 2. From a Westminster vantage, these are non–negotiable objections, touching the principia of theology and the very nature of the **Trinity**.

Yet there are limited but real points of learning for Reformed theologians. Pannenbergs relentless insistence on the public, historical reality of the **resurrection** provides a valuable corrective to privatized or merely existential faith and can enrich Reformed apologetics when subordinated to Scripture. His engagement with **philosophy of science** and critical realism models a way of speaking about God in the university that does not retreat into fideism, which resonates with the Reformed concern, articulated by **Van Til** and **Vos**, that Christianity claims the whole of reality. Some Reformed theologians, such as **Kevin Vanhoozer** and **Michael Horton**, have appropriated aspects of Pannenbergs attention to narrative history and eschatology while firmly reasserting the primacy of canon and the Creator–creature distinction. The task for a Westminster candidate is to receive his questions and some of his emphases on history and public reason while clearly rejecting his methodological starting point and his eschatological conditioning of divine identity.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
A safe opening line in an oral exam would be to say that **Pannenberg** is the major late twentieth–century German theologian who sought to ground all Christian doctrine in the public, critical interpretation of **history**, with the resurrection of Jesus as the decisive but provisional clue to the meaning of the whole. Another defensible sentence is that for Pannenberg, **revelation** is not an inner experience or a timeless idea, but Gods self–disclosure in the comprehensive history of the world, interpreted eschatologically. It is also safe to affirm that Pannenberg robustly defends the bodily **resurrection** of Christ against demythologizing and insists that Christian claims must be open to rational scrutiny. Such formulations show that you understand both his positive contribution and the structural location of his work within debates after **Bultmann** and **Barth**.

There are, however, phrases that must be carefully qualified. Saying that for Pannenberg, revelation is mediated through **history** rather than directly through **Scripture** is accurate, but you must immediately add that this stands in real tension with Reformed confessional teaching on Scripture as principium. Avoid unqualified talk of his openness to **universalism**; it is better to say that his eschatological vision and stress on the universal scope of reconciliation create a strong tendency toward universal salvation, though he does not finally dogmatize it. Do not say that he simply proves the deity of Christ by historical argument, which is a caricature. Instead, say that he argues the deity of **Christ** is historically plausible and rationally inferable from the resurrection, while a Reformed approach grounds confession first in Gods self–attesting **Word**. Steer clear of adopting his language that the truth of Christian doctrine remains in principle falsifiable; if you mention this, note that this is precisely where a Reformed view of **faith** and revelation parts company.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings such as the idea that Pannenberg is just another existential **liberal** or that he denies the resurrection. You should be clear that he is actually closer to an evidential **apologist** for the resurrection, though in a critical realist mode. Another common confusion is to lump him with **Moltmann** as a pure social trinitarian; you should stress that Pannenberg is more concerned with the eschatological disclosure of the **Trinity** through history than with intra–divine perichoresis as a political model. Finally, some students exaggerate his continuity with **Barth**; correct this by emphasizing that Pannenberg rejects Barths notion of revelation as self–authenticating Word and relocates verification into the arena of common historical reason. Throughout, keep signaling that you can admire his seriousness about **history** while standing firmly on a Reformed doctrine of Scripture and God.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, the enduring value of **Pannenberg** lies in his bold insistence that the God of the Bible acts in real **history**, that the resurrection of Jesus is a publicly significant event, and that Christian theology must address the whole of reality rather than a religious corner. Yet we must firmly deny his methodological decision to subordinate **revelation** to universal history, his relativizing of Scriptural finality, and his eschatologically conditioned account of the **Trinity** and divine identity, all of which undermine the Reformed principia and the classical doctrines of Gods aseity and immutability. If pressed, you should say that you affirm Pannenbergs challenge to speak credibly of the resurrection and the kingdom in the modern world, but you reject his proposal that theology is a revisable historical hypothesis, and you stand instead with **Calvin**, **Bavinck**, and **Van Til** in confessing Gods self–attesting Word in Scripture as the final norm by which history is to be interpreted and the triune God of the gospel as eternally complete in himself, not dependent on the worlds future for his identity.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Wolfhart **Pannenberg** is the late twentieth–century German theologian who tried to relocate all Christian doctrine into the public court of universal **history**, with the resurrection of Jesus as its decisive clue.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1928 in Stettin, educated in **Berlin**, **Gottingen**, and **Basel**, and teaching mainly in **Heidelberg** and **Munich** in the post–World War II German context.
- **Revelation as History** 1961 and **Jesus – God and Man** 1964 launch his program of a historical, evidential **Christology** grounded in the resurrection.
- His three–volume **Systematic Theology** 1988–1993 and his **Anthropology in Theological Perspective** 1985 offer mature statements on **Trinity**, eschatology, and humanity.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Pannenberg treats **revelation** as Gods self–disclosure in universal history, not as an inner feeling or as Scripture in isolation from the broader historical process.
- He employs a critical realist **reason** where theology functions as a rational hypothesis about the whole of reality, open to public debate and revision.
- The churchs **faith** is an anticipatory, historically informed judgment about Gods final victory, not an immediate certainty grounded solely in the internal testimony of the Spirit and **Scripture**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **revelation and Scripture**, he subordinates the authority of the **Bible** to the broader horizon of universal history, in which revelation is ultimately verified only at the eschaton.
- On **Christology**, he argues in **Jesus – God and Man** that the deity of Christ is historically inferable from the evidential force of the resurrection within **history**.
- On the **Trinity**, he claims in **Systematic Theology** that Gods triune identity is eschatologically manifested and thus in some sense historically conditioned.
- On **anthropology** and church, he portrays humanity as essentially future–oriented and the church as a proleptic sign of universal reconciliation within Gods **kingdom**.
- On **eschatology**, he emphasizes the proleptic presence of the future in the resurrection while leaving strong room for an open–ended, near–universal reconciliation.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- A Westminster examiner will press that Pannenberg reverses the Reformed order by interpreting **Scripture** through history rather than history through Scripture as the principium.
- His eschatologically conditioned account of the **Trinity** and divine identity clashes with Reformed doctrines of Gods **aseity**, simplicity, and immutability.
- His view that theological truth claims remain revisable and in principle falsifiable contradicts Reformed convictions about the certainty of **revelation** and assurance.
- His universal–history and reconciliation emphasis raises concerns about **universalism** and the blurring of the antithesis between church and **world**.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Pannenberg vs Barth** on whether revelation is self–authenticating Word in Christ and Scripture or mediated through critical interpretation of universal **history**.
- **Pannenberg vs Bultmann** on the reality of the historical **resurrection** and the legitimacy of demythologizing.
- **Pannenberg vs Van Til** on the principial role of **Scripture** and whether history can function as a neutral court of appeal for Gods existence.
- **Pannenberg vs Bavinck** on whether **Trinity** and divine attributes are eternally fixed in God or in some way eschatologically determined.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Wolfhart **Pannenberg** compellingly forces us to take Gods action in history and the resurrection seriously, but his attempt to make history rather than Scripture the final court of appeal leaves Reformed theology no choice but to mine his insights selectively while decisively rejecting his methodological core.
