### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context: Aberdeen retrieval, Augustinian ressourcement, and postliberal ethics
Brian Brock emerges within the early twenty-first-century renaissance of **theological ethics** in the United Kingdom, a moment marked by the aftershocks of **postliberal hermeneutics**, the **MacIntyrean critique of modernity**, and the constructive retrievals fostered at **Aberdeen** by figures such as **John Webster**. The signal of this context is a confident return to **dogmatics as moral grammar** and to **Scripture** as the field in which Christian practical reason is acquired. Brock is unmistakably **Augustinian** in temper, yet he reads **Augustine** through a set of late modern lenses shaped by **Barth** on revelation, **Bonhoeffer** on concrete discipleship, **Hauerwas** on ecclesial witness, and **O’Donovan** on moral order and resurrection. These convergences position him even when he contests them, yielding a method that refuses an abstract **ethics of principles** and instead advances an **ethics of sanctified attention** learned amid **worship**, **catechesis**, and the **reading aloud of Scripture**.

The intellectual atmosphere is defined by two anxieties that Brock addresses head on: the crisis of **moral knowledge** in modernity, and the destabilization of the **self** by pervasive **technological mediation**. In the wake of **MacIntyre’s** account of moral fragmentation and **Ellul’s** analysis of la technique, Brock presses an ecclesial alternative that re-centers **desire** and **perception** in Christ. His location in Aberdeen situates him between a **Barthian** stress on divine initiative and a **Catholic** ressourcement of **virtue** and **natural law**, while the Scottish context constantly puts him in conversation with **Reformed** questions about **Scripture’s sufficiency**, **pneumatology**, and **public reason**. The result is a project that is historically catholic yet hermeneutically Protestant, where **exegesis** is not application but the site of **moral ontology**.

#### 2. Method: theological exegesis as moral ontology and sanctification of perception
Brock’s method coheres around three mutually interpreting claims: first, that **Scripture’s literal sense is moral**; second, that moral knowledge is a **gift of grace** that sanctifies the **senses**; and third, that the church’s **liturgical time** and **ecclesial practices** constitute the schooling of that perception. The core phrase he advances is the **moral ontology of Scripture**. This signals that the Bible does not merely supply ethical content as examples or rules, but performs the **divine address** that shapes the creature’s being-in-Christ. In **Singing the Ethos of God** 2007 he argues that the Bible’s forms of speech, its psalms, parables, prophetic oracles, and apostolic exhortations, effect a transformation of the reader’s **habitus**. The theological grammar is Augustinian: **ordo amoris**, the ordering of loves, is renovated by the Spirit through the church’s hearing of the Word. The ethics that follow are neither casuistry nor unmediated intuition, but the **conversion of vision**, a sanctification of what we notice and how we remember.

Critical to this method is Brock’s refusal of **revelation as data** and of **moral theory** as an external grid. He aligns with **Barth** in insisting that ethical knowledge is correlative to **God’s self-communication**, but he refuses Barthism’s occasional neglect of **virtue** by retrieving **Augustine’s** full-orbed account of desire, **patience**, and **humility**. He appreciates **O’Donovan’s** account of **resurrection and moral order**, but he subjects any talk of **natural law** to the cruciform schooling of Christ’s body. The technical vocabulary is minimalistic but clear: the church learns to see through **scriptural theoria**. Textual categories like **literal sense** and spiritual **sensus** are pressed into service as moral formation, echoing patristic exegesis. The result is a posture where **sanctification of perception** precedes the derivation of **norms**, and where **doctrine**, **exegesis**, and **ethics** form a single science.

#### 3. Singing the Ethos of God 2007: exegesis, worship, and the ethics of attention
Brock’s first major monograph, **Singing the Ethos of God** 2007, is a programmatic statement for his entire project. The book makes two strategic moves. First, it excavates a **biblical poetics** of ethics, arguing that Scripture’s concrete literary forms enact moral pedagogy. Second, it locates this pedagogy within **worship**. Singing is not an illustration but a mode of **ethical knowing**. Drawing extensively on **Augustine’s expositions of the Psalms** and the bishop’s analysis of **desire** and **patience** in the *Enchiridion* and *City of God*, Brock contends that moral agency is trained through **psalmody**, **lectio**, and the **public reading of Scripture**. The appeal to **Bonhoeffer’s Life Together** amplifies the communal dimension: the Word is heard and obeyed together.

Against a standard hermeneutics that puts ethics downstream from exegesis, the book insists that **exegesis is already ethical** because the Spirit’s address summons the reader into **obedience**. The chapter architecture thus weaves **text**, **doctrine**, and **practice** into a single path of **catechetical ethics**. Brock’s interlocutors include **Hauerwas** on the primacy of the church’s practices, **Webster** on the theological nature of Scripture, and **O’Donovan** on moral reasoning. The constructive proposal places **virtue acquisition** not in a moral marketplace of options but in the Spirit’s use of **Scripture** to reconfigure the self’s **memory, understanding, and will**. The book thereby establishes the banner theme of Brock’s corpus: **morality as the church’s mode of hearing God**.

#### 4. Christian Ethics in a Technological Age 2010: power, perception, and the Sabbath
If the first book establishes the moral ontology of Scripture, **Christian Ethics in a Technological Age** 2010 stages Brock’s confrontation with **modern technology**. He engages **Heidegger’s** analysis of enframing, **Ellul’s** depiction of technique’s autonomy, and **Borgmann’s** device paradigm, yet he reframes them christologically. Technology is not an external sphere but an **environment of desire** that can colonize **attention**, distort **time**, and render the neighbor a **function**. Rather than treating technology as morally neutral tools, Brock exposes the **liturgical** and **catechetical** powers of infrastructure, screens, and systems. In this register, **Sabbath** becomes a cardinal practice for redeemed perception, a school in the re-creation of time that resists the total mobilization of the self in late modern technocracy.

The book’s doctrinal spine is **creation and providence** ordered to **Christology**. Brock contends that technics are embedded in God’s **good creation**, but that their fallen deployment as autonomous powers must be discerned under the **Cross**. The Spirit awakens the church to perceive the **powers and principalities** at work in tool ecologies and to name specific sins of **impatience**, **pride**, and **control**. He refuses naive romanticism and technophobia by demanding **ecclesial practical wisdom** that can name good uses and proper limits. Here the interplay with **O’Donovan** is evident in the stress on **order**, yet Brock leans more **Augustinian** in diagnosing **concupiscence** and thus insists on the primacy of **grace** for any redirection of technique. The book draws together **virtue ethics**, **eschatological patience**, and concrete guidance that privileges practices of **attention**, **neighborliness**, and truthful **speech** in digitally saturated contexts.

#### 5. Disability theology: tradition, imago Dei, and the reconfiguration of witness
Brock’s sustained work in **disability theology** marks a second axis of his contribution. With **John Swinton** he co-edited **Disability in the Christian Tradition** 2012, a major reader that retrieves texts from **the Fathers** through **Reformers** and **modern theologians** to map how the church has spoken about impairment, healing, and sanctity. The constructive turn comes in **Wondrously Wounded: Theology, Disability, and the Body of Christ** 2019, where Brock offers a reparative account of **imago Dei**, **sanctification**, and **ecclesial membership** rooted in the gospel’s unacceptable grace. The phrase wondrously wounded names the paradox that baptismal identity is cruciform and that the church’s life is defined by the Spirit’s work among those the world deems unproductive or defective.

Against genealogies that treat disability solely via social construction or medical deficit, Brock assembles an **Augustinian** and **Barthian** dogmatics that refuses both romanticization and utilitarianism. He revises talk of **imago Dei** away from capacities and toward **relation to Christ** and **vocation** in the body. The church’s practices of **baptism**, **Eucharist**, **catechesis**, and **friendship** are ethical sites that display God’s economy of care. At the same time he deals with uncomfortable texts and histories, including coercive healing narratives and exclusionary instincts, to advance a **truthful repentance** that can purify speech and practice. The interlocutors include **Jean Vanier**, **Amos Yong**, and **Swinton**, but Brock’s distinctive note is a thick **dogmatic anchoring** of disability that demands the church learn to perceive the glory of Christ in its least honored members.

#### 6. Augustinian grammar: desire, patience, and sanctified memory
Across his corpus Brock’s idiom is decisively **Augustinian**. He repeatedly returns to **ordo amoris**, **concupiscence**, and **patientia** as the grammar that narrates Christian action. Desire is not eradicated but re-ordered through the Spirit’s school of **Scripture** and **liturgy**. In this frame the church is a pedagogy of **patience** that stretches time toward the **eschaton**, training believers to wait without panic, to pray psalms without haste, and to respond to the neighbor without instrumentalizing their life. The theological anthropology is tripartite in an Augustinian key: **memory, understanding, will** are sanctified through the church’s hearing of the Word, such that ethics is nothing other than **discipleship** under **Christ’s Lordship**.

This Augustinianism keeps Brock close to **Barth** on the primacy of grace but equips him with a metaphysic of **love** that can interpret **virtue** without dissolving it into moralism. He can therefore affirm **MacIntyre’s** insight that practices confer **internal goods**, yet he resists moral communities as merely traditions by insisting that the **Triune God** is the acting subject shaping the community’s life. In disability, technology, and scriptural ethics he circles back to the same ethical picture: sanctified attention to the neighbor is the fruit of attention to God’s **address**; and attention to God is trained by **Scripture’s moral ontology**.

#### 7. Ecclesial practices as the site of knowledge: worship, catechesis, and truthful speech
Brock’s insistence that ethics is learned within the **church’s practices** produces a concrete pedagogy. Worship is not a spiritual add-on but the **epistemic center** where the Spirit gives knowledge. The **psalms** teach honesty and lament, the **Gospels** school us in patience with Jesus’s pacing, and **Paul’s letters** form communities of truthful speech. The effect is a recovery of the dictum **lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi**, where praying shapes believing and believing shapes living. Brock’s practical proposals are not technocratic solutions but **habits**: keeping **Sabbath**, specifying **confession** and **intercession**, practicing **hospitality** that includes disabled members as teachers, refusing the false urgency of **technological acceleration**, and guarding **speech** against violence and flattery.

His prose often turns to the dynamics of **attention**. Because modern life is attention-scarce, the church must be an attention-rich ecology where **Scripture** is heard slowly and the **Eucharist** is celebrated as gratitude that reorders desire. In technology ethics this means embodying alternative rhythms that expose the gods of productivity. In disability theology this means attending to the **gifts** of members whose lives rewrite the community’s assumptions about **ability**, **dependence**, and **mutual care**. The result is a vision of Christian ethics as a public witness that speaks best when it is most recognizably **ecclesial**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and disciplinary edges
Brock’s dialogue partners are wide-ranging, yet several debates recur. With **Hauerwas** he shares a stress on **ecclesial formation**, yet Brock presses more explicit **dogmatic** anchoring and a thicker **Augustinian** anthropology of desire. With **O’Donovan** he converses over **natural law** and **public reason**. Brock does not reject natural law but insists that any talk of the **order of creation** be mediated by **Christ’s cross and resurrection** and by the church’s acquired **virtues**. With **Barth** he aligns on **revelation’s primacy**, though he resists any eclipse of creaturely histories and practices by a purely kerygmatic ethic. With **Ellul** and **Borgmann** he appropriates analyses of technological domination, but he adds the explicitly **sacramental** and **ecclesial** modes of resistance that only a dogmatic account can justify.

He also occupies critical ground within **disability studies**. He appreciates **Amos Yong’s** pneumatological inclusivism and **Swinton’s** pastoral wisdom, while worrying that the church can slip into pragmatic inclusion without the **dogmatic** renovation of **imago Dei** and **holiness**. He names the risk of sentimentalizing disability or defining the person solely through social agency. Conversely, he rebukes the allure of purely **medical** redemptions that treat bodies as adjustable projects. This dialectic reveals Brock’s refusal of reductionisms. The living alternative is the church as Christ’s **body**, whose unity honors differentiation and whose holiness includes weakness in the very display of **glory**.

#### 9. Contribution and development: coherence across Scripture, technology, and disability
The coherence of Brock’s oeuvre lies in the repeated claim that God’s **Word** makes a people whose **attention** is sanctified, and that all ethical domains must be read from that theological center. **Singing the Ethos of God** 2007 established the dogmatic and hermeneutical groundwork by showing how **Scripture** performs moral formation. **Christian Ethics in a Technological Age** 2010 translated that grammar into the late modern habitat of **technology**, giving the church practices to resist encroaching idolatry. **Disability in the Christian Tradition** 2012 and **Wondrously Wounded** 2019 then located the same grammar in the concrete life of bodies differently abled, reimagining **imago Dei** and **ecclesial membership**. The internal linkage is **Augustine’s** depiction of rightly ordered love and **patience**, transposed into the ecclesial rhythms of **Sabbath**, **psalmody**, and **truthful speech** that create a people capable of discerning the **powers** and welcoming the **weak**.

This project is not a system in the scholastic sense, but it is systematic in the Reformed sense that **doctrine and life** are inseparable. The pastoral edge remains sharp. Brock’s writing always turns toward the concrete: congregational timekeeping, digital habits, baptismal catechesis, catechetical naming of sin and grace, and the hundred small disciplines that produce a public witness. His distinct contribution among contemporary ethicists is to keep **Scripture** unmistakably at the center while refusing biblicism, to retrieve **virtue** without moralism, and to expose **technology’s** moral liturgies without nostalgia. The cumulative effect is a theologically thick and pastorally useful account of Christian ethics for an age of acceleration and fragmentation.

In Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Brock’s strengths and tensions come into focus. His **sola Scriptura-shaped** insistence that **Scripture** is the moral ontology of the church resonates strongly, as does his Augustinian emphasis on **grace**, **sin**, and **sanctification**. His critique of **technological idolatries** fits a **Van Tilian** antithesis between obedience and autonomy, and his redefinition of **imago Dei** in relational and vocational terms corrects capacity-based distortions. Yet tensions remain. His **ecclesiocentrism** risks obscuring **two-kingdoms** or **sphere sovereignty** distinctions that protect legitimate creaturely tasks, and his deep suspicion toward **natural law** may undercut Reformed accounts of **common grace** and **creational norms** operative in public life. A classical Reformed alternative would affirm Brock’s **Christological hermeneutic** and ecclesial formation while more explicitly articulating **covenantal order**, **general revelation**, and **law-gospel** distinctions for public ethics. Even so, Brock offers a needed corrective: only a people schooled by **Word and Spirit** can rightly discern and deploy **nature** and **culture** under the Lordship of Christ.
