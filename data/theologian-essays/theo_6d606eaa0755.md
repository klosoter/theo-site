### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context
Guy Prentiss Waters emerges as a **contemporary Reformed** theologian whose vocation is forged at the crossroads of **Pauline studies** and **confessional Presbyterian** life. Trained in rigorous **New Testament exegesis** while rooted in the **Westminster standards**, he occupies the crucible where **E. P. Sanders**, **James D. G. Dunn**, and **N. T. Wright** reframed Paul through the lens of **Second Temple Judaism** and where North American Presbyterians wrestled with **Federal Vision** revisions to **covenant** and **sacrament**. Waters has served at **Reformed Theological Seminary** in Jackson, Mississippi, as both professor and ecclesial theologian, moving fluidly between **classroom exegesis**, **session and presbytery** counsel, and public engagement in churchly debates. His formation under the broader guild of Pauline intertextuality, with scholars such as **Richard B. Hays**, taught him to hear **Scripture echo** Scripture, while his confessional commitments trained him to distinguish **exegesis** from **revisionism**. The result is a body of work that balances academic precision with pastoral urgency across **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramentology**.

Waters is best read as a confessional corrective to two late modern trajectories: first, the **New Perspective on Paul**, whose historical reconstructions often relocate **justification** within **ecclesial boundary-making**; second, the **Federal Vision**, whose emphasis on the **objectivity of the covenant** and **baptismal union** blurs the Reformed distinction between **decretal election** and **covenantal administration**. Set against this backdrop, Waters articulates a classically **Reformed doctrine** of **forensic justification** grounded in **imputation**, a **means-of-grace** sacramentology, and a **presbyterian polity** that stewards the church under Christ's kingship. His historical moment is post-critical but not anti-critical, aiming to receive the best of **historical context** and **intertextual method** without capitulating to **sociological reduction** of the gospel.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Waters' method is a disciplined blend of **grammatical-historical exegesis** and **biblical-theological** synthesis under a self-conscious **confessional** rule of faith. He reads Paul canonically through **covenant** categories anchored in **creation**, **law**, and **promise** as fulfilled in Christ, and he locates **justification** in the sphere of the **divine courtroom** rather than in **ecclesial sociology**. His appeal to *lex* and *evangelium* is frequent, and he insists that **union with Christ** is both the **Christological locus** of salvation and the theological architecture that distinguishes **justification** from **sanctification** while holding them inseparably together, in the Reformed *duplex gratia*. Against the **New Perspective**, he argues that the exegesis of **dikaio-** terms, **works of the law**, and **righteousness** must be governed by Paul's own **covenantal narrative** and not by an imposed **social-history** of **Jewish boundary markers**.

Epistemically, Waters labors to keep **exegesis** primary and **doctrine** disciplined by textual judgment, yet he refuses a naive historicism. For him, the **Westminster Confession** functions as a hermeneutical summary rather than a controlling lens. Thus, he tolerates genuine historical insight into **Second Temple Judaism**, but he critiques **E. P. Sanders' covenantal nomism** and **N. T. Wright's** reconfiguration of **justification** as essentially an **ecclesiology** of inclusion. He finds in **Richard B. Hays** helpful tools for tracing **Scripture's echoes**, yet he resists any method that would mute the **forensic** and **eschatological** dimensions of Paul's gospel. His rhetorical posture is patient, cumulative, and continually returns to the constraints of **Greek syntax**, **canonical context**, and **Reformed dogmatics**.

#### 3. Major works: Paul and justification
Waters' early signature monograph, **Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul** 2004, is a careful survey and critique of **Sanders**, **Dunn**, and **Wright**, mapping the internal diversity of the **New Perspective** while showing where each proposal departs from **Paul** and from **Reformed orthodoxy**. The book rehearses the exegesis of **Romans 3 to 5**, **Galatians 2 to 3**, and **Philippians 3**, insisting on **forensic justification** grounded in the **active and passive obedience of Christ** and received **sola fide**. He argues that "works of the law" in **Paul** cannot be confined to **ethnic boundary markers**, but refer comprehensively to human deeds under the **Mosaic economy**, thereby safeguarding **imputation** and excluding **works** from the instrumentality of **faith**. The constructive portion reaffirms the **Westminster Confession 11** on **justification**, with sustained attention to **union with Christ** as the Christological soil from which **imputation** grows, not as its replacement.

In **The Life and Theology of Paul** 2019, Waters provides a synthetic account of **Pauline theology** oriented to the **ordo salutis** and the **historia salutis**, drawing on **Acts** and the epistles. He structures Paul's thought around **covenant**, **Christ**, and **church**, notably refusing to collapse **justification** into **ecclesial identity**. Here he takes up **final judgment according to works** as a genuinely Pauline theme, yet differentiates it sharply from any **final justification** on the basis of works. In doing so he retrieves a classic **Reformed twofold grace**, noting that the Spirit's **sanctifying** work yields evidences that bear on **judgment** while not compromising **justification's** definitive, **forensic** character. The watersheds are thus clearly marked: **justification extra nos** by **imputed righteousness**, and **sanctification in nobis** by **renewal**, within **union with Christ**.

#### 4. Covenant theology and the Federal Vision
If the **New Perspective** brought academic pressure to redefine **justification**, the **Federal Vision** brought ecclesial pressure to reconceive **covenant** and **sacrament**. In **The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology** 2006, Waters undertakes a comparative analysis of core **Federal Vision** claims with historic **Reformed covenant theology**. He catalogues distinctive emphases of **Douglas Wilson**, **Peter Leithart**, and **Norman Shepherd**, including the **objectivity of the covenant**, **baptismal union**, and a tendency to speak of **covenant faithfulness** as instrumental to **final justification**. Waters measures these claims against **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Westminster Larger Catechism** teaching on **election**, **covenant administration**, **sacramental efficacy**, and the **assurance** that rests on **Christ's work** rather than on covenantal performance.

His analysis centers on the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** distinction, a hallmark of **Reformed orthodoxy**. Waters argues that the **Federal Vision** rhetoric about **obedient faith** and **covenant loyalty** risks erasing the law-gospel distinction central to **Pauline justification**. Moreover, he maintains that identifying **baptism** as the moment of objective **union with Christ** misunderstands both the **sign-signified** relation and the **efficacious instrumentality** of faith wrought by the Spirit. Where some Reformed voices propose **republication** of the **covenant of works** in the **Mosaic economy**, Waters carefully distinguishes pedagogical uses of the law from any re-legalizing of the covenant of grace, while remaining within the **confessional** spectrum of acceptable readings. The guiding concern is to secure **Christ alone** as the righteousness of sinners and to situate **obedience** within **sanctification** and **gratitude**, not as a co-instrument with **faith** in **justification**.

#### 5. Ecclesiology and polity
A distinctive contribution of Waters is his sustained attention to **presbyterian polity** and the governance of the church under Christ's **mediatorial kingship**. In **How Jesus Runs the Church** 2009, he traces the biblical foundations of **eldership**, **courts of the church**, **discipline**, and **connectionalism**, showing how **Acts 15**, **1 Timothy 3**, and **Titus 1** together underwrite a graded system of government that protects **doctrinal fidelity** and **pastoral care**. He presents the **keys of the kingdom** as ministerial rather than magisterial, echoing **Calvin's** distinction between **Christ's dominion** and **ministerial authority**. The **visible and invisible church** distinction is treated not as an ontological dualism but as a biblical way of speaking about the church's **mixed condition** in history, a crucial category for resisting both **sacramentalism** and **sociological skepticism**.

Waters' polity work is not procedural only; it is theological. He argues that **church discipline** is a concrete application of the **means of grace** in sanctifying and consoling souls and in preserving the church's witness. He warns that ecclesial innovations commended under the banner of **missional necessity** often smuggle in doctrinal mutations and that **presbyterian order** protects the church by subjecting pastors and congregations to **mutual accountability**. This ecclesiology coheres with his **soteriology**: the **church** is the arena where the **Word** is preached, the **sacraments** are administered, and discipline is exercised, all ordered to the glory of **Christ** and the building up of the **saints**.

#### 6. Sacramentology and means of grace
In **The Lord's Supper as the Sign and Meal of the New Covenant** 2019, Waters develops a **covenantal sacramentology** attentive to both **institution words** and **canonical theology**. He argues that the **Supper** is a **means of grace** in which believers, by the **Spirit**, truly feed on **Christ** by **faith**, receiving the benefits of his **once-for-all** sacrifice. Waters retrieves **Calvin's real spiritual presence** while guarding against **transubstantiation** and **memorialism**, and he structures the argument around **new covenant** promises, **exodus typology**, and **eschatological banquet** themes. The **sign-signified** grammar is consistently maintained: **bread and wine** signify and seal **Christ and his benefits**, and their reception is **efficacious** in the mode of **promise** to **faith**.

Waters brings the same coherence to **baptism**, though more through essays and church reports than in a single monograph. He defends **covenant baptism** of **believers and their children** as an inclusion into the **visible church**, distinguishing **external administration** from **internal saving union**. This guards the integrity of the **gospel** by refusing to equate the **seal** with the **thing sealed**, while receiving the sacrament as a genuine **divine means**. Against **Federal Vision** claims of a *de facto* **baptismal union** identical with **saving union**, he insists on the **Westminster** doctrine of **efficacy not tied to the time of administration** and the primacy of **faith** as the Spirit's instrument.

#### 7. Scripture, intertextuality, and canonical judgment
Throughout his corpus, Waters exhibits confidence in **Scripture's clarity** and **authority**, arguing that the **canon** is self-interpreting in a rule-governed way. His interaction with **Richard B. Hays** and the burgeoning field of **intertextuality** is appreciative yet critical: he employs **echoes** and **allusions** to enrich the meaning of **Paul** and **Acts**, but he anchors those echoes in explicit **citation**, **lexical overlap**, and **contextual coherence**. This guards against a free-associative style that would evacuate **doctrine** of its **forensic** and **covenantal** determinacy. Waters' contributions to **A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the New Testament** 2016 show him practicing a **canonical exegesis** that moves from **text** to **theology**, not by allegorical leaps, but by tracing **promise-fulfillment**, **type-antitype**, and **eschatological** realization in **Christ**.

Theologically, this canonical discipline underwrites his polemics and his constructive work. For instance, when distinguishing **justification** from **sanctification**, Waters appeals not to confessional fiat but to Paul's **argumentative structure** in **Romans** and **Galatians**, to the flow of **covenant** in **Genesis to Jeremiah**, and to the **gospels'** presentation of **Christ's obedience** and **atonement**. By refusing both **biblicism** and **traditionalism**, he exhibits a **Reformed catholicity** that is responsive to the text and receptive of the **great tradition** where it is textually warranted.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates
Waters' principal interlocutors cluster around two nodes. In Pauline studies, **E. P. Sanders** introduced **covenantal nomism** that shifted the problem-space from **legalism** to **ethnocentrism**, **James D. G. Dunn** recast **works of the law** as **boundary markers**, and **N. T. Wright** reframed **justification** as an **identification badge** for the **people of God**. Waters answers each by restating the **Reformed** reading of **law** and **gospel** and the **federal headship** of **Christ**, preserving **imputation** as essential to the **evangel**. In ecclesial debates, **Norman Shepherd's** understanding of **justification** and the **Federal Vision** converge on a soteriological scheme that threatens the **sola fide**; Waters articulates the **Westminster** position with historical and exegetical ballast, drawing on **Calvin**, **Turretin**, **Murray**, **Vos**, and **Bavinck**. His appeal to **Vosian** biblical theology ensures that covenant is not flattened into a legal scheme but remains an **eschatological communion** grounded in **Christ's mediation**.

His conversational tone is civil but firm. He acknowledges genuine insights from the **New Perspective** regarding the **corporate** dimensions of Paul's gospel and the importance of **Abrahamic promise**, while maintaining that such emphases must not displace the **individual's standing coram Deo**. He grants to **Federal Vision** voices the concern for **covenant community** and **discipleship**, yet he demonstrates that these goals are better served by a clear **law-gospel** distinction, a robust **assurance** grounded in **Christ**, and **sacraments** that function as **means of grace**, not as mechanisms of **conditional finality**.

#### 9. Legacy and constructive trajectory
Waters' legacy to date rests in stabilizing **confessional Presbyterian** churches through academic and pastoral articulations of **justification**, **covenant**, and **church order**. His influence is visible in seminary curricula, presbytery exams, and local church teaching on **faith and works**, **baptism and the Supper**, and **sessional** governance. His books, particularly **Justification and the New Perspectives on Paul** 2004 and **The Federal Vision and Covenant Theology** 2006, became touchstones for pastors negotiating the twin fronts of **Pauline revisionism** and **covenant innovation**. Later works like **The Lord's Supper as the Sign and Meal of the New Covenant** 2019 and **The Life and Theology of Paul** 2019 carry that stabilizing posture into constructive biblical theology that nourishes preaching and catechesis.

Looking ahead, Waters' commitments position him to engage newer debates, such as discussions about **Paul within Judaism**, renewed proposals on **pistis Christou** as **faithfulness of Christ**, and evangelical reassessments of **final judgment** and **rewards**. His insistence on **union with Christ** as the encompassing soteriological reality, with **justification** and **sanctification** distinguishable within that union, equips him to affirm orthodoxy while absorbing exegetical gains. His ecclesiological work can also address contemporary challenges in **church discipline** and **sexual ethics**, grounding practice in **Scripture** and **confession** rather than in **cultural accommodation**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage point, Waters is a reliable exegete-theologian who safeguards **forensic justification**, **imputation**, and the **means of grace**, and who locates **church polity** under **Christ's headship**. His strengths include clarity about **law and gospel**, fidelity to **Westminster 11 and 27 to 29**, and judicious use of **biblical theology** in a **Vosian** key. Doctrinal tensions arise where hard lines must be drawn without loss of nuance: first, in assessing **Second Temple Judaism**, a **WTS** faculty member might urge greater integration of **apocalyptic** motifs and the **Adamic** frame of **Romans 5** in conversation with careful threads in **Wright** and **Gathers** without collapsing **forensic** categories; second, in navigating **Mosaic covenant** questions, some will prefer a stronger **republication** thesis in a **Klinean** register, while Waters often stresses the continuity of the **covenant of grace**. On **final judgment according to works**, Waters rightly refuses a **final justification** but could further clarify the relation of **Spirit-wrought obedience** to **assurance** in a **Murray** and **Gaffin** synthesis. These are family debates. In principle, Waters' project exemplifies the **Reformed** priorities of revelation over speculation, covenant over abstraction, grace over synergy, redemptive history over historicism, and nature renewed by grace under **Scripture's sufficiency**. His corpus stands as a measured, text-driven, and church-serving witness to **confessional Reformed** catholicity.
