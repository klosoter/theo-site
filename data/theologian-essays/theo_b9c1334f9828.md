### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, intellectual setting, and method
Andrew M. Elam emerges as a contemporary Reformed pastor-theologian working in the wake of **Geerhardus Vos** and **Meredith G. Kline**, with a distinct focus on the grammar of **covenant theology** and the exegetical payoffs of **redemptive-historical** method. His formation is marked by immersion in the **OPC** and **Westminster Seminary** tradition, where the hermeneutical turn to **biblical theology** reconfigured the locus of **law and gospel**, **creation and covenant**, and the contested place of **republication** in the **Mosaic covenant**. Elam adopts a methodological stance that privileges the canonical shape of Scripture, ANE-informed readings of **suzerain-vassal treaties**, and a principled use of the **Westminster Confession** as doctrinal regulator. The frequent appeal to **Vosian eschatology**, **Klinean treaty-forms**, and the old Reformed idiom *foedus operum* and *foedus gratiae* anchors Elam in the classical sources while pressing forward the debates surrounding **typology**, **holy war**, and **intrusion ethics**.

Elam’s epistemic posture is neither biblicist nor speculative. He argues that dogmatics is an ordered reflection on the exegesis that the canon demands, so that **systematic theology** codifies but does not constrain **redemptive-historical exegesis**. In this he follows **Herman Bavinck’s** insistence on the principled unity of Scripture and doctrine and **Van Til’s** creator-creature distinction, while deploying **Kline’s** comparative analysis of **ANE treaties** to locate **Deuteronomy** and **Sinai** in a public legal-judicial frame. The corkscrew of the method is a double movement: backward into **Reformed scholasticism** with **Witsius** and **Turretin** on the **covenant of works**, and forward into **canonical eschatology** with **Vos** and **Kline** on the Sabbath goal and the intrusion of the age to come.

#### 2. Early work and the republication problem
Elam’s early essays stake out a carefully qualified account of **republication**. Drawing from **Galatians 3** and **Romans 5**, he defends the thesis that the **Mosaic covenant** bears a dual aspect: an administration of the **covenant of grace** to Israel’s remnant and a typological overlay that recapitulates the formal structure of the **covenant of works** at the level of the national economy. The claim is not that Israel is saved by works but that the land tenure, cultic purities, and sanctions of **Leviticus** and **Deuteronomy** operate under a republication of the works principle in the sphere of typology. In the language he uses, **typological merit** functions not soteriologically but theocratically, delineating how the holy nation images Adamic sonship in a symbolic realm of **intrusion ethics**.

Engaging **John Murray’s** reservations about the **covenant of works** nomenclature, Elam returns to **Witsius** and **Turretin** to show that Reformed orthodoxy distinguished between the moral law as **lex naturae** and the positive content of the **Sinaitic code**, allowing for a typological republication that is not a Pelagian regression. He reads **Deuteronomy’s** treaty form through **Kline’s** analysis of suzerain prologue, stipulations, sanctions, and oath-ceremony as encoding a public law-world in which Israel, as corporate Adam, bears the burden of the theocratic order. This legal frame permits Elam to explain the severe exile sanctions as covenant lawsuit within the republication register, while maintaining the evangelical strand of **Moses** as minister of the **covenant of grace**.

#### 3. Klinean inheritance: treaty, typology, and holy war
A hallmark of Elam’s project is his constructive reception of **Meredith G. Kline**. He adopts Kline’s categories of **intrusion ethics**, **common grace**, and the **two kingdoms**, but seeks to tether them more explicitly to confessional formulations in **Westminster Confession** 7 and 19. Elam clarifies that **intrusion ethics** names the temporary suspension of common-grace penal restraint in the holy realm, manifested in **holy war** and cultic sanctions, so that the eschatological retribution intrudes proleptically into Canaan. The **common grace** order remains governed by patience and forbearance, while the theocratic sphere foreshadows the final assize. These frames, Elam argues, resolve readings that flatten **Joshua** or **Leviticus** into timeless civil paradigms.

Within this Klinean inheritance, Elam defends **typological merit** as a limited category. He frequently cites **Leviticus 18.5** and **Deuteronomy 28** to show that obedience secures life and blessing in the land, but only as symbolic pedagogy pointing to the Last Adam. The point is not that Israel achieves forensic righteousness, but that the nation functions as a cosmic parable. Here Elam sets **Adam-Christ** typology from **Romans 5** in tandem with **Israel-Christ** typology from **Matthew** and **Hebrews**, concluding that Christ recapitulates and fulfills the typological works principle through his active obedience under the law. In short, **republication** underwrites the soteriological necessity of **Christ’s active obedience** without making Moses a minister of works-righteousness.

#### 4. Law, gospel, and the Mosaic economy
Elam’s development of **law and gospel** follows the confessional bright line while recognizing the layered character of the **Mosaic economy**. He endorses the triadic division of the law, with **moral**, **ceremonial**, and **judicial** aspects, and he argues that **Westminster Confession** 19 accommodates the overlay of republication by noting that the moral law, as a covenant of works, was delivered to Israel at Sinai. Yet he insists that as an administration of the **covenant of grace**, Sinai communicates Christ, the sacrificial typology of **Leviticus**, and the pedagogy of the **tabernacle** and priesthood. Elam frequently invokes **Galatians 3.24** to describe the law as **paidagogos** unto Christ, in which the strictness of sanctions magnifies the gospel’s graciousness.

He situates this within a broader **biblical-theological** arc from **creation Sabbath** through **Noahic covenant** to **Abrahamic promise** and **Sinaitic law**, culminating in the **new covenant**. For Elam, the **Noahic covenant** sustains the **common grace** arena, while the **Abrahamic** and **Sinaitic** covenants advance the redemptive line. The **two kingdoms** schema, in his usage, is not a dualism but a differentiation of administrations: Christ rules providentially over all and redemptively over his church by word and sacrament. The clarity gained, he contends, keeps the church from confusing **civil prudence** with **ecclesial discipline**, a point he draws sharpened from **Kline** and refined with **VanDrunen**.

#### 5. Paul, Galatians, and the function of Sinai
A center of gravity in Elam’s argument is the reading of **Galatians 3**. He strengthens the traditional Reformed appeal to **lex non est ex fide** by indicating that Paul’s antithesis targets the Mosaic law when absolutized as a means of justification, while affirming the typological function of Sinai within the economy of promise. Elam aligns with interpreters who see **Galatians 3.12** and **3.19** as clarifying the added, provisional, and custodial place of the law. He resists the **New Perspective on Paul**, while acknowledging the social-historical concerns of boundary markers, arguing that Paul embeds those concerns within a deeper Adamic and Abrahamic frame of **works and grace**.

In Romans 5 and 7, Elam detects the same legal pedagogy. The trespass multiplied under law so that grace might abound, a pattern that explains **republication** as intensification of law’s ministry of death. Here his resonance with **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** is evident in the union-with-Christ frame, even as he insists on the forensic center of justification. For Elam, the point is not that the law is bad, but that the **Sinaitic administration** intentionally highlights both the righteousness of God’s demand and the futility of human merit, so that the typological works principle would drive Israel to the Messiah who alone meets the condition.

#### 6. Sacrament, oath, and covenantal form
Extending **Kline’s** insight in By Oath Consigned, Elam treats the sacraments as **covenantal oaths**, signs and seals that bind and curse as well as bless. Baptism, he argues, is a **judicial oath-sign** that marks inclusion in the covenant realm, setting the participant under heightened sanctions should unbelief persist. The Lord’s Supper similarly operates as **covenantal communion** with Christ’s body and blood, both nourishing and threatening if profaned. Elam retrieves **Reformed scholastic** language of sacramental efficacy in *signum* and *res*, careful to locate instrumentality under the Spirit’s sovereign action.

At the level of polity and piety, Elam situates sacramental practice within the church’s distinct calling under Christ’s **mediatorial kingship**, distinguishing the **spirituality of the church** from the management of the **common kingdom**. This is not a retreat from public theology, he argues, but a reassertion of jurisdictional clarity. The integrity of the sacramental oath depends on the church’s refusal to instrumentalize word and sacrament for political ends, a point he marks as a confessional entailment of **two kingdoms**. The ecclesial administration of the **keys of the kingdom** thereby remains protected from confusion with civil coercion.

#### 7. Holy war, intrusion, and ethics
Elam’s constructive ethics draw on **intrusion** as the interpretive key to **holy war** and the imprecatory register of Scripture. He aims to release the church from the burden of direct imitation in civil policy by locating **Joshua’s** wars and **Deuteronomy’s** sanctions within the typological republication that has passed away with the dissolution of the theocracy. The result is a principled non-transferability of theocratic penalties to modern states. He thus fuses **common grace** patience with **civil prudence**, and **holy war** with eschatological judgment reserved for Christ’s return.

This ethical construction also tempers culture-war rhetoric. Using **two kingdoms** categories, Elam encourages vigorous natural-law reasoning in the civil sphere, while insisting that the church’s weapons remain **word, sacrament, and discipline**. The ethic of exile replaces the ethic of conquest for the new covenant pilgrim people. At the same time, Elam underscores that the church’s holiness is not lowered but raised in the new covenant through union with the crucified and risen Lord, a point he grounds in **Hebrews** and **1 Peter**, and one that reframes any appeal to the Mosaic civil code.

#### 8. Sources, interlocutors, and historical retrieval
Historically, Elam reads **Witsius** and **Turretin** as witnesses for a carefully delimited **republication** and a broad catholicity of **covenant theology**. He sees **Herman Bavinck** as a tutor in the organic unity of special revelation and the grace-nature distinction, guiding his suspicion of nature-grace conflations that blur **common grace** and **redemptive grace**. With **John Murray**, he registers the gains of dialectical clarity in union with Christ and the centrality of Christ’s lordship, yet he declines Murray’s terminological reticence about the **covenant of works**, preferring **Westminster Confession** 7’s stable grammar.

In contemporary debate, Elam engages the **PCA** and **OPC** discussions around **republication** and **two kingdoms**, interacting with supporters like **David VanDrunen** and cautious critics who fear antinomian or quietist implications. He argues that his position intensifies law’s abiding third use precisely by distinguishing its moral core from the defunct typological shell, thereby honoring **Westminster Confession** 19 on the abrogation of ceremonial and judicial laws while maintaining the **moral law’s** perpetual normativity. His retrieval of **Kline** is thus both appreciative and corrective, aiming to render Kline’s categories explicitly confessional and pastorally tractable.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Elam’s project commends several strengths and exposes several tensions. On the strength side, his appeal to **Vosian eschatology**, **Klinean treaty forms**, and the confessional architecture of **Westminster 7 and 19** yields real exegetical clarity in **Deuteronomy**, **Galatians**, and **Hebrews**. His account of **typological merit**, **intrusion ethics**, and **sacramental oath** solidifies distinctions between **common** and **redemptive** kingdoms, rescuing the church from theocratic misappropriation. He rightly refuses to collapse the **Mosaic covenant** into a sheer law covenant while preserving the **law-gospel** antithesis at the level of justification. On the tension side, advocates of a more integrative **Murray** line will worry that the republication overlay risks conceptual bifurcation within Sinai and could imply two competing principles under one covenant. Others will insist that **two kingdoms** language, if not carefully tethered to **Christ’s mediatorial kingship**, invites practical quietism and underestimates the church’s prophetic obligation. A WTS-calibrated alternative would retain Elam’s **redemptive-historical** acuity and the typological limits he draws, while amplifying the **covenantal unity** from **Abraham through Moses to Christ**, emphasizing the pedagogical and evangelical intent of the law without invoking the nomenclature of **typological works principle**. Yet, when pressed, Elam’s position can be stated in strictly confessional terms: one **covenant of grace** variously administered, with **Sinai** intensifying law’s pedagogy under a unique theocratic administration that has reached its terminus in Christ. For a Reformed seminar, his synthesis offers a clear option in principle on revelation, covenant, grace, history, and nature, and it remains a serious, pastorally attentive iteration of the **Klinean** strand within confessional orthodoxy.
