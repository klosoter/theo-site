### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
David **VanDrunen** emerges as a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose signature contribution is a retrieval of **two kingdoms** doctrine and **natural law** within a robust **covenantal** framework. Teaching since the early 2000s at **Westminster Seminary California**, he stands within a Klinean stream shaped by **Meredith G. Kline** and classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, while bringing unusual interdisciplinary expertise as a theologian trained also in **law**. His work unfolds in late-modern **post-Christendom** conditions in North America, amid debates on **church and state**, **religious liberty**, and the public role of **natural law** in a fragmented moral order. The sociopolitical pressures of the culture wars form the backdrop against which he commends a restrained, principled vision of **common grace** and **prudential governance** under the **Noahic covenant**. Methodologically, he marries **redemptive-historical biblical theology** to a historical-theological retrieval of **Calvin**, **Vermigli**, **Turretin**, and **Althusius**, claiming that older Reformed sources long affirmed a real distinction between **civil** and **ecclesial** institutions and a usable **lex naturalis** for life among the nations.

VanDrunen self-consciously rejects both a collapsing of **nature into grace** and the privatization of **faith**; instead he proposes a dual-kingdoms arrangement under the one **sovereignty of Christ**. The **redemptive kingdom** is institutionalized in the visible **church**, governed by the **Word and sacraments**, animated by the **Spirit**, and oriented to the **heavenly city**. The **common kingdom** encompasses political, economic, and cultural life shared with unbelievers, ordered by **natural law** and regulated, not redeemed, through **Noahic** norms of preservation. This methodological triad of **covenant**, **kingdom**, and **natural law** enables him to argue for Christian political modesty amid pluralism while upholding confessional **Reformed** convictions about **sin**, **common grace**, and **eschatology**.

#### 2. Early articulation: natural law and two kingdoms
In **A Biblical Case for Natural Law?** 2006, VanDrunen contests the late twentieth-century **Reformed** suspicion that **natural law** is exclusively **Roman Catholic** or rationalist. He reads **Romans 1 to 2** and **Genesis 9** as anchoring a creational moral order accessible to reason and conscience, though suppressed in unrighteousness. Here the imago Dei is a key axis: as image-bearers humans retain sufficient moral awareness to sustain social life within the **common kingdom**. In **Bioethics and the Christian Life** 2009 he applies this framework to contested questions like end-of-life decisions, embryology, and reproductive technologies, modeling **prudence** and demonstrating how **natural law** can inform public deliberation, even as the church teaches a more comprehensive **moral theology** from **Scripture**.

The two 2010 volumes, **Natural Law and the Two Kingdoms** and **Living in God’s Two Kingdoms**, advance historical reconstruction and constructive dogmatics. The former traces the development of **natural law** and **two kingdoms** in **Reformed** thought from **Calvin** through **Althusius**, insisting that a dual-institutional pattern is not a Lutheran import but a Reformed inheritance. The latter offers a pastoral distillation: it differentiates the **cultural mandate** given to humanity in **creation** and sustained through the **Noahic covenant** from the **Great Commission** entrusted to the church. He argues that ordinary cultural labors are not vehicles of eschatological transformation but arenas for **neighbor love** under **common grace**. The emphasis falls on **vocation**, **contentment**, and **pilgrim holiness** rather than projects of culture-wide **redemption**.

#### 3. Covenantal deepening: Divine Covenants and Moral Order
With **Divine Covenants and Moral Order** 2014, VanDrunen presents his most thorough theological account, relocating **natural law** within **covenant theology**. The central claim is that the **moral order** is covenantally mediated, not an abstract moral ontology standing beside **revelation**. He reads the **Adamic**, **Noahic**, **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, and **New** covenants as a unified but differentiated economy, where the **Noahic covenant** functions uniquely as a universal, non-redemptive covenant of preservation. As such, the **Noahic covenant** grounds **political authority**, retributive **justice** in the prohibition of bloodshed, and basic social institutions like **marriage** and **commerce**. Meanwhile the **Abrahamic** and **New** covenants create the **holy society** of the church, ordered to **Word**, **sacraments**, and **discipline**. Israel’s **Mosaic polity** is treated through **Kline’s intrusion ethics** as an eschatological type whose civil law does not norm ordinary states in the present age. Thus VanDrunen dissents from **theonomy**, affirms a permanent **moral law**, and yet denies a direct civil application of **Israel’s** cultic and judicial norms.

Two theological payoffs follow. First, **eschatology** governs ethics: because the **consummation** awaits Christ’s return, the present form of the world is preserved rather than perfected. Second, **public reason** is possible but not salvific: **natural law** supplies common moral knowledge adequate for adjudicating temporal justice, though only the **gospel** renovates the heart. The result is a chastened confidence in **prudence**, coupled with a clear limitation of the church’s corporate mission to the **means of grace**.

#### 4. Political theology after Christendom
In **Politics after Christendom** 2020, VanDrunen addresses the pressures of democratic pluralism and resurging **integralism**. He argues that civil authority is ministerial, limited, and accountable to the **Noahic** terms of justice and peace. The magistrate vindicates the **second table** of the law as summarized in justice toward neighbor, not the **first table**’s duties toward God, which belong to the **redemptive kingdom** and the liberty of conscience. Here he engages **Oliver O’Donovan** on the authority of the risen Christ in political orders and **John Finnis** on the structure of basic goods, affirming insights while expressing distinctively **Reformed** reservations about sacral politics and rationalist natural-law systems.

He resists **integralist** proposals to re-embed political orders within a confessional sacred canopy, and he rejects **theonomy** and **Christian Reconstructionism** as misconstruing the **Mosaic** civil code’s status. At the same time, he distances himself from **Anabaptist** or **Yoderian** pacifism by affirming the legitimacy of the sword in **Romans 13** under **Noahic** authorization. The net effect is a principled pluralism: the state preserves a just peace among diverse communities, the **church** disciples pilgrims toward the heavenly city, and Christians inhabit vocations as citizens of both kingdoms without collapsing one into the other.

#### 5. Ecclesiology, sanctification, and vocation
VanDrunen’s **ecclesiology** is intentionally institutional. The **visible church** is the embassy of the **redemptive kingdom** where Christ reigns **by Word and sacrament**. He accents the **spirituality of the church** in a classically Reformed key, not as withdrawal from public life but as clarity about the church’s corporate mandate. Pastors preach **law and gospel**, administer **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**, and exercise **discipline**; they do not legislate public policy or mobilize the church as a political action committee. This ecclesial minimalism is the corollary of his robust differentiation of **common** and **holy**. It is also an outworking of **pilgrim sanctification**: Christians pursue holiness marked by hope and patience, refusing to identify temporal successes with eschatological victory.

On **vocation**, he draws from **Calvin’s** doctrine of calling and affirms the goodness of ordinary labors within the **common kingdom**, guided by **prudence** and **natural law**. The goal is not to make culture Christian, but to perform good work for the neighbor, to do justice, and to bear witness to the **gospel** through honest presence and speech. This pastoral ethic tempers triumphal **transformationalism** and provides ballast against despair in late-modern civic life.

#### 6. Retrieval and distinction: Calvin to Althusius
Historically, VanDrunen contends for a **Reformed** pedigree for **two kingdoms** doctrine. He reads **Calvin’s duplex regimen** as distinguishing the spiritual government of Christ in consciences and the external civil order, and he traces analogous patterns in **Vermigli**, **Beza**, **Turretin**, and the jurist **Johannes Althusius**. He argues that early modern **Reformed** thinkers affirmed the use of **natural law** in civil life and did not expect ecclesiastical institutions to administer statecraft. This retrieval rebuts the assumption that all robust **Reformed** social thought is **neo-Calvinist**.

At the same time, he takes careful distance from **Lutheran** two-kingdoms dualism. His two kingdoms are not law versus gospel or hidden versus revealed God, but **covenantally** differentiated modes of Christ’s rule as Creator and Redeemer. The **Noahic** frame prevents a gnostic retreat from the world by affirming the goodness of creation and the integrity of civil life, even as the **Abrahamic-New Covenant** frame secures the church’s pilgrim identity.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates: neo-Calvinism, theonomy, and public reason
VanDrunen’s most persistent debate is with **neo-Calvinism**, especially **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck**. He appreciates their accounts of **common grace** and **sphere sovereignty** yet fears that a transformational project blurs the **common-redemptive** distinction and tempts the church to confuse mission with cultural program. He also critiques **James K. A. Smith** and other renewalists who reframe **liturgy** as the engine of cultural renewal, warning against collapsing **ecclesia** into **polis**. Against **theonomy** and **Christian Reconstructionism** he deploys **Kline’s intrusion** exegesis to deny the present binding force of Israel’s civil law. Against **integralism** he argues that confessional establishment is not mandated under **Noahic** terms and risks violating **religious liberty** and the integrity of the **church’s** spiritual means.

In dialogue with **Oliver O’Donovan** and **John Finnis**, VanDrunen appropriates without capitulating. He welcomes **O’Donovan’s** christological political ontology but insists on the covenantal delimitation of civil authority. He appropriates **Finnis’s** account of basic goods and practical reason while resisting a metaphysical natural law that could float free from **covenant**, **creation**, and **fall**. His approach thus claims catholic breadth with **Reformed** specificity.

#### 8. Moral reasoning under the Noahic covenant: bioethics and society
Applied ethics provides a proving ground for VanDrunen’s **natural law** program. In **bioethics**, he argues for the sanctity of life, the integrity of **marriage**, and the limits of technological manipulation by appealing both to **Scripture** and to creational norms accessible to public reason. On **marriage**, he defends its creational form as a one-flesh union ordered to procreation and stability, thus framing public arguments that do not require sectarian premises while grounding the church’s fuller teaching in the **moral law** and **covenant**. On **commerce**, he affirms property and contract as elements of the **common kingdom** that serve neighbor-love but denies their redemptive status. The magistrate, as **Romans 13** minister of justice, punishes wrongdoing and praises what is right, but does not police beliefs or sacramental practice.

Prudence is decisive in his account of **public reason**. He argues that Christians should reason with their neighbors using **natural law** and shared goods, aware of **sin’s** distortions yet confident that the **Noahic** framework preserves enough order for real cooperation. The church’s witness then carries a double register: evangelistic proclamation in the **redemptive kingdom** and patient moral suasion in the **common**. This dual register avoids both sectarian retreat and the temptation to wield ecclesial authority as political leverage.

#### 9. Clarifications and misreadings
Because VanDrunen’s **two-kingdoms** thesis has been polemically received, he frequently clarifies misreadings. He denies any sacred-secular dualism and insists that both kingdoms fall under the one **lordship of Christ**. He denies quietism, since the **Noahic** charge authorizes meaningful civic engagement, including office-holding and political advocacy. He also denies that the church is apolitical, since its **liturgy**, preaching of **law and gospel**, and **discipline** reshape people who then act in the world. Yet the church’s political effect is indirect and derivative, never programmatic. He finally emphasizes that **natural law** is not a salvific path or autonomous philosophy but a covenantally grounded moral grammar adequate for shared life amid pluralism. In this way his project strives to combine **theological realism** about sin with **institutional clarity** about the church and state.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, VanDrunen’s strengths are considerable. His retrieval of **two kingdoms** and **natural law** within **covenant theology** offers a principled alternative to both triumphal **transformationalism** and reactive **integralism**. His Klinean use of the **Noahic covenant** clarifies civil authority, honors **common grace**, and protects the **church’s spirituality**. His reading of **Romans 13** and **Genesis 9** grounds a coherent political modesty, while his emphasis on **Word and sacrament** recenters ecclesial life. Yet tensions remain. First, critics influenced by **Van Til** worry that confidence in **natural law** underestimates the **antithesis** of worldviews and the noetic effects of **sin**, risking a nature-grace dualism foreign to the comprehensive **lordship of Christ**. Second, **neo-Calvinists** argue that he overdraws the **common-redemptive** line and neglects **sphere sovereignty**, failing to show how Christ’s **ascension** and **Pentecost** affect cultural life beyond the church. Third, historically minded confessionalists note that classic **Reformed** political theology, reflected in the original **Westminster Confession 23**, assigned magistrates a role relative to the **first table**, a point VanDrunen revises in the name of **religious liberty**. An alternative within **classical Reformed** orthodoxy would affirm one kingdom under Christ with differentiated offices and jurisdictions, integrate **natural law** under **Scripture** while accenting the **moral law**, and retrieve **Kuyper’s** **sphere sovereignty** to explain differentiated but accountable cultural life. Still, as a disciplined Klinean proposal for post-Christendom prudence, VanDrunen’s project is a significant and salutary contribution to contemporary **Reformed** ethics.
