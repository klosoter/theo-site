### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andrew J. Byers emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** theologian whose work straddles **biblical studies** and **ecclesial theology**, rooted in UK research culture associated with **Durham** and conversant with both **historical criticism** and **theological interpretation**. His intellectual formation is marked by a double fidelity: rigorous attention to **Johannine literature** in its **Second Temple** milieu and pastoral attentiveness to the **digital age** and its recalibration of communal life. Methodologically, Byers pursues a **canonical-exegetical** reading that resists the fragmentation of texts into hypothetical layers, preferring the final form of **John** and its theological coherence. He retrieves **patristic theosis** without forfeiting Protestant sensibilities, situating participation in God within **Christology**, **pneumatology**, and **ecclesiology** rather than in metaphysical ascent. This is an integrative method, attentive to **Marshall McLuhan’s** media axiom the medium is the message while maintaining **sola Scriptura** and a catholic sensibility for **Word and sacrament** as God’s ordinary means.

Byers frames his work as an ecclesial service. He is not a systematician in the scholastic mode but a biblically moored theologian shaping ministers for the **missio Dei**. His interlocutors range from **Rudolf Bultmann** and **J. Louis Martyn** on the **Johannine community** to **Richard Bauckham** and **Larry Hurtado** on **early high Christology**, with constructive dialogue partners in **Andrew Louth**, **John Zizioulas**, and **Michael Gorman** on **theosis** and **participation**. The conceptual nexus is consistent: **mediated revelation** and **participatory union** are not parallel projects but convergent claims about how the **triune God** communicates and incorporates a people into divine life through **Scripture**, **Spirit**, and the **ecclesia**.

#### 2. Early constructive work: disillusionment and hope
Byers’s first widely read contribution, **Faith Without Illusions: Following Jesus as a Cynic-Saint** (2011), maps the spiritual topography of contemporary **evangelical** disillusionment. The book is pastoral yet theologically intentional, framing Christian existence as cruciform **hope** amid hypocrisy and fragmented institutional credibility. Byers blends **Augustinian** realism about sin with a **Bonhoefferian** call to costly discipleship, urging a posture he names the **cynic-saint**: critical without corrosive nihilism, hopeful without sentimental triumphalism. The implicit doctrinal architecture is clear: **hamartiology** that explains moral failure, **ecclesiology** that refuses ecclesial abandonment, and **Christology** that centers on the **cross** as the locus where disillusionment is transfigured. Theologically, this anticipates his later emphases on **mediated revelation** and **participatory holiness**, where ecclesial weakness becomes the canvas for **Spirit**-wrought renewal.

The book’s method signals Byers’s ongoing commitment to a Scripture-shaped imagination. He leans on the **wisdom literature**, the **Psalms**, and **John’s Gospel** for practices of lament and fidelity, resisting the purely therapeutic turn in popular evangelical discourse. The tone is critical but collegial, not least in its handling of **authority**, where **sola Scriptura** is commended without denigrating the role of community, tradition, or guided doubt. This early work sets a trajectory: ecclesial formation must be tethered to **revelation** while candid about the church’s compromised witness in late modernity.

#### 3. TheoMedia: the media of God and the digital age
With **TheoMedia: The Media of God and the Digital Age** (2013), Byers offers a more formal theological account of **mediated revelation**, setting biblical communication within the wider horizon of **media ecology**. Drawing on **Marshall McLuhan**, **Walter Ong**, and **Neil Postman**, he argues that divine self-disclosure is not an abstract information transfer but a sacrally textured **mediation** across varied media: **creation** as theophanic sign, **Israel’s liturgical calendar**, **prophetic speech acts**, the **Incarnation** as the medium of God’s presence, **Scripture** as Spirit-breathed witness, and the **church’s sacraments** as embodied signs of grace. The thesis is not that digital tools are evil but that they reconfigure attention, authority, and presence, thereby demanding catechesis in **media discernment** if the church is to remain a **community of the Word**.

Byers’s constructive move is to insist that Christians already inhabit a divinely wrought **media ecosystem** in which **Word and sacrament** are primary. The **Incarnation** appears as the paradigmatic medium, where the **Logos** mediates the **Father** by the **Spirit**, calibrating all subsequent ecclesial communication. Byers appropriates **patristic** instincts about icons and the **sacramental** imagination without collapsing them into visualism or technological optimism. He is wary of digital commodification of the self and of **idolatry** that reduces God to consumable content. The upshot is a call to recalibrate liturgical and catechetical practices so that ecclesial attention is seized by **Scripture** and sustained by **Spirit**-enabled participation in the **body of Christ**. The doctrine of **revelation** is thus reframed as inherently mediated, covenantal, and ecclesially embedded.

#### 4. Ecclesiology and theosis in John’s Gospel
Byers’s academic centerpiece, **Ecclesiology and Theosis in the Gospel of John** (2017), advances a carefully exegeted claim: **Johannine theosis** is the grammar of the church’s identity, where believers participate in the triune communion that unites **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**. Without importing alien metaphysics, Byers shows how **mutual indwelling** language in **John**—abide in me and I in you, that they may be one as we are one—yields a robust **participatory ecclesiology**. The architecture of the argument is textual: **John 1.12** on filial adoption, **John 6** on bread of life discourse, **John 14-16** on **Paraclete** indwelling, and **John 17** on the high priestly prayer’s participatory oneness. Byers reads this corpus through patristic lenses, particularly **Athanasius’s** axiom that God became human so humans might share the divine life, and **Gregory of Nazianzus’s** vision of deified humanity, yet he reinscribes these in a biblical key that protects the **Creator-creature distinction**.

The result is a Protestant-friendly account of **theosis** as sanctified **union with Christ** rather than ontic absorption. Byers echoes **Michael Gorman’s** cruciform participation and correlates Johannine **glory** with the **cross**, so that deification is cross-shaped rather than triumphalist. The **Spirit** emerges as the agent of participation, indwelling believers as the mode of divine presence. Byers’s engagement with **Raymond Brown** and **J. Louis Martyn** is appreciative but corrective: whereas sectarian readings of the **Johannine community** incline toward sociological isolation, Byers’s participatory grammar positions the church toward **mission**, unity, and the world God loves. Theosis becomes a communal calling to share God’s life for the world’s sake.

#### 5. Sacramental signs and ecclesial presence
A significant dimension of Byers’s **ecclesiology** is his treatment of **sacramental realism** in **John**. He does not impose anachronistic sacramental systems onto the text, yet he recognizes John’s symbolic density around **water, Spirit, and bread**. The new birth in **John 3** with water and Spirit, the **footwashing** of **John 13** as enacted parable of cleansing communion, and the detailed **bread of life** discourse with its insistence on eating the flesh and drinking the blood of the Son point, in Byers’s analysis, to an ecclesial life organized by embodied signs. Here his earlier work on **TheoMedia** proves illuminating: sacramental practices are not optional sentimental rituals but primary divine **media** by which the **triune God** communicates grace and gathers a people.

This is not an invitation to sacramental maximalism. Byers is alert to **John’s** pervasive motif of **witness**, where **Scripture**, **Spirit**, and **community** converge to bear testimony. The church mediates presence as a community of **abiding** rather than as an ontologically necessary extension of Christ’s person. The point remains ecclesial: the **body of Christ** in history is the habitat of **participatory holiness**, the place where **revelation** is heard, enacted, and seen in love. Thus **theosis** entails ethical visibility as much as mystical ascent, tethering contemplative union to public love in the pattern of the **new commandment**.

#### 6. Jewish-Christian relations, sectarianism, and mission
Byers positions his **Johannine** exegesis within the volatile terrain of **Jewish-Christian** relations. He is attentive to **Second Temple** backgrounds and to the vexed history of **anti-Judaism** in interpretations of **John**. While engaging **Martyn’s** two-level drama and **Brown’s** community reconstruction, Byers resists caricatures of John as inherently sectarian. The **world** that God loves in **John 3.16** precludes ecclesial isolation, and the polemics within the Gospel are read as intra-Jewish debates about **messiah** and **temple** rather than as proto-supersessionist manifestos. This hermeneutical ethic aligns with his broader commitment to **mission** and **reconciliation**, wherein **participatory theosis** fuels a posture of witness rather than of withdrawal.

Theologically, Byers’s move reframes **identity** through **union with Christ** rather than through boundary policing. His reading of **glory** and **lifting up** directs the community’s gaze to the **cross** as the center of divine self-revelation and human incorporation, a place where hostility is slain. The **Spirit’s** role as convictor of the world confirms the outward thrust of Johannine **communion**. In this way, Byers triangulates **ecclesiology**, **mission**, and **theosis** toward a nonsectarian catholicity that is nonetheless confessionally robust.

#### 7. The integrative thesis: mediated participation
When read as a whole, Byers’s oeuvre advances an integrated vision: **mediated revelation** and **Johannine theosis** are mutually implicative features of Christian existence in late modernity. The **triune God** communicates through the **media** God appoints, climactically through the **Incarnation** and normatively through **Scripture**, **Spirit**, and **church**. This communication is not merely cognitive; it is incorporative, drawing believers into **union with Christ** and the **perichoretic** life of God as **adopted** children. Byers refuses the false choice between propositional **revelation** and mystical **participation**, arguing that biblical revelation is inherently participatory and that authentic participation is governed by biblical **witness**. His constructive energy is thus located at the interface of **attention** and **abiding**, a timely focus when digital capitalism fragments both.

This integrative thesis yields pastoral directives. A church discipled by **TheoMedia** will curate its liturgies to privilege **Word and sacrament**, will catechize in **media discernment** that resists idolatrous attention economies, and will cultivate practices of **abiding** that anchor identity in **union with Christ** rather than in performative self-branding. A church nourished by **Johannine theosis** will pursue holiness as shared life in the **Spirit**, communal love as the **new commandment**, and mission as the overflow of divine **communion**. The grammar is Trinitarian, ecclesial, and eschatological, tethered to the **cross** yet oriented toward resurrection life in the midst of the world God intends to renew.

#### 8. Reception, pedagogy, and ongoing contribution
Byers’s work has circulated widely in ecclesial and academic contexts that prize **theological interpretation of Scripture**, with notable uptake among **evangelical Anglicans** and pastors navigating the **digital turn**. His pedagogy reflects the same integration as his writing: seminars on **John** are resourced by **patristic theosis** and contemporary **media theory**, and pastoral training is framed by **missional ecclesiology** that refuses to cede attention to platforms at the expense of **presence**. Interlocutors such as **Richard Bauckham** on **divine identity Christology** and **Michael Gorman** on **participation** have proven constructive foils, sharpening Byers’s insistence that **theosis** is centered on the **crucified** and **risen** Lord and not on speculative ontology.

In terms of ongoing contribution, Byers’s trajectory points toward further articulation of **Johannine theology** for a fractured media landscape. The durability of his claims will depend on sustained exegetical work and on deeper liturgical-ethical proposals for **digital discipleship**. Yet the core claims already display a distinct profile: a biblically rooted account of **participatory union** that navigates between assimilation to **Eastern Orthodox** emphases on **theosis** and **Reformed** commitments to **union with Christ**, and a practical theology of **revelation** that honors **sola Scriptura** while integrating **sacramental** and communal **media**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Byers’s project offers fruitful convergence and some tensions. Positively, his **Johannine theosis** maps closely onto the classic Reformed locus of **union with Christ**, through which the **duplex gratia** of justification and sanctification flows. His insistence that participation is cruciform and **Spirit**-wrought guards the **Creator-creature distinction** and avoids mystical ontologism. His stress on **mediated revelation** resonates with a Reformed account of **Word and sacrament** as instituted means of grace and with a covenantal understanding of **revelation** as historically enacted. Furthermore, his critique of the **digital attention economy** harmonizes with **Van Tilian** concern for idolatry and the antithesis between divine wisdom and worldly folly. The tensions are manageable but real. First, the language of **theosis** can be pastorally ambiguous in Reformed settings, where an imprecise rhetoric of deification may obscure the forensic priority of **justification** and the asymptotic character of sanctification this side of glory. Second, while Byers valorizes **sacramental realism**, a Reformed account will want to specify a **Calvinian** presence in the Supper and a robust **preaching** of **Scripture** as the primary conduit of faith, lest the medium relativize the **verbum Dei**. Third, the media model must be explicitly chastened by **sola Scriptura**, ensuring that all ecclesial **media** are normed by the inspired text rather than by ecclesial practice or digital necessity. A Reformed alternative would thus translate **Johannine theosis** into **union with Christ** within a covenantal frame, align **mediated revelation** with the instituted **means of grace**, and double down on the **antithesis** in curating digital practices, even while gratefully receiving Byers’s exegetical correction and ecclesial exhortation.
