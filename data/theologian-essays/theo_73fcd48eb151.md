### ESSAY
Jonathan Chaplin emerges as a leading contemporary exponent of **Neo-Calvinist political theology**, translating the legacy of **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Dooyeweerd** into the contested arenas of **post-Christendom** constitutional democracies. Formed within the orbit of **Reformational philosophy** and active as a teacher at the **Institute for Christian Studies** in Toronto, and later as director of the **Kirby Laing Institute for Christian Ethics** in Cambridge from 2006 to 2017, he writes in the key of **public ethics** rather than dogmatics, yet his work presupposes a recognizably **Reformed doctrinal horizon** of **creation order**, **common grace**, and the **antithesis**. He addresses the late modern predicament in which **liberal public reason**, **multicultural deep diversity**, and **religious freedom** are renegotiated in law and culture. His method is confessionally candid: Christians ought to bring explicitly **theological reasons** into public life, yet do so in modes accountable to the norms of **public justice** and dialogical reciprocity. The intellectual setting is also defined by a triangulation with **John Rawls** and **Jürgen Habermas** on the one hand, and **Nicholas Wolterstorff** and **Oliver O Donovan** on the other, as Chaplin adjudicates the possibilities for **comprehensive doctrines** in democratic deliberation.

At the heart of Chaplin’s method stands a **Reformational social ontology** indebted to **Dooyeweerd’s law-idea**, **modal plurality**, and **sovereignty in its own sphere**. The world is structured by creationally given but historically unfolding **differentiated spheres** of society, each bearing its own **irreducible normativity**. The **state** is neither the apex of a hierarchical order nor the neutral arbiter of private projects, but an institution with a distinctive task: the securing of **public justice** for the commonwealth. On Chaplin’s reading, the state’s competence is bounded both by the inner laws of other spheres such as **family**, **school**, **church**, **firm**, **university**, and by the state’s own juridical telos. This doctrine of **structural pluralism** resists both **statism** and **libertarian privatism**. It insists upon **institutional religious freedom** and not only individual liberty, precisely because groups have God-given tasks that the state must respect. Theologically, this stance reflects **creation-fall-redemption**: social plurality is good as creation; power is distorted by the **fall**; political life can be relatively renewed under **common grace** yet remains **penultimate** under an **eschatological reserve**.

Chaplin’s 2011 monograph **Herman Dooyeweerd: Christian Philosopher of State and Civil Society** offers his most sustained account of these foundations. He presents **Dooyeweerd** as a systematic philosopher whose **modal aspects** and **individuality structures** yield a precise grammar for political judgment. The book elucidates how **sphere sovereignty** differs from **Catholic subsidiarity**. Subsidiarity distributes tasks downwards within a largely unitary social order, while sphere sovereignty asserts multiple, coordinate authorities irreducible to one another. Thus, the **state** has a monopoly not of ultimate authority but of **public legal coercion** for the sake of **right** and **justice**, while **civil society** bodies possess original competencies. Chaplin retrieves Dooyeweerd’s critique of **historicist** and **positivist** accounts of law in order to ground the state’s task in a creational **juridical aspect**. He also corrects his master by pushing toward a less schematic and more historically attentive reading of **institutional differentiation**, a move influenced by **Charles Taylor’s** narrative of modern social imaginaries.

The 2016 report **Talking God: The Legitimacy of Religious Public Reasoning** turns these ontological commitments into a political-ethical proposal. Chaplin challenges **Rawlsian public reason** with its duty of **restraint** and the supposed need to bracket **comprehensive doctrines** in public justification. He argues that such bracketing surreptitiously imposes a **liberal comprehensive doctrine**, thereby violating the very neutrality it claims. In critical dialogue with **Habermas’s translation proviso**, he affirms the civic value of bilingual citizens who can speak in both **confessional registers** and commonly accessible **civic idioms**, yet he rejects any rule that would disable religious language at the point of legislative or judicial decision. Instead, he outlines a standard of **public accountability**: religious reasons are legitimate when they answer to the shared goods of **public justice**, when they are presented with reciprocity, and when they accept constitutional constraints such as **basic rights** and the rule of law. The report thus reframes **public reason** not as a filter that excludes religion but as a practice of responsible communication among parties committed to the **common good** within a **pluralist constitutional order**.

In the edited volume **God and the EU: Faith in the European Project** also from 2016, Chaplin extends his **principled pluralism** to the supranational scale. Against both **Eurosceptic nationalism** and technocratic **centralism**, he proposes a **multi-level constitutionalism** informed by **sphere sovereignty** and a chastened appropriation of **subsidiarity**. The **European Union** should neither mimic a sovereign state nor devolve everything to member nations. It should instead discern the proper competencies of transnational agencies in relation to **states**, **regions**, **markets**, **civil associations**, and **churches**, with **public justice** as the criterion. The book criticizes **laicite** as an ideology of secular uniformity and commends a **post-secular** openness to religious contributions in European public life. Chaplin’s argument here is not simply institutional but theological: the **imago Dei** bestows dignity upon persons and communities, so that transnational governance must be ordered to protect **human rights**, ensure equitable **economic norms**, and safeguard **religious freedom** across complex jurisdictions.

Chaplin’s mature statement, **Faith in Democracy: Framing a Politics of Deep Diversity** in 2021, consolidates his proposals for late-modern democracies marked by intense **ethical pluralism**. He advances the idea of **deep diversity** as a realistic description of societies filled with rival comprehensive visions, and then argues that **democratic legitimacy** can be sustained only by embedding **principled pluralism** into constitutional design. The state should not adopt an **established secularism** or a confessional monopoly but instead treat citizens and their associations as bearers of diverse obligations under **creational norms**. He defends **institutional religious freedom**, conscientious exemption regimes calibrated by **public justice**, and legal room for **faith-based schools**, **medical providers**, and **charitable agencies** to pursue their own distinctive ethos. Yet he also emphasizes **reciprocity** and the limits of freedom where **basic rights** and the state’s juridical telos are at stake. His constructive account engages **Wolterstorff’s** rights-based justice, **O Donovan’s** account of authority under divine judgment, and the **Rawls-Habermas** debate over public justification. The result is an integrative vision where **confessional candor** and **civic responsibility** mutually discipline one another.

A recurrent theme across these works is Chaplin’s distinction between **structural** and **directional** dimensions of social life, a distinction inherited from **Dooyeweerd** and popularized by **Al Wolters**. Structural goods of **creation** abide, such as the legitimacy of **marriage**, **commerce**, **art**, **education**, and **political authority**. Directional perversions arise from the **fall** and are discerned in idolatrous absolutizations of any single sphere, such as **economism**, **statism**, or **scientism**. In public ethics this yields a twofold task: preserve and reform the creational structures through law and policy aimed at **public justice**, while resisting directional idolatries through **prophetic critique** and prudent **institutional design**. Chaplin’s doctrine of **common grace** underwrites the possibility of civic cooperation across confessions without collapsing the **antithesis** between obedience and idolatry. His account thereby navigates between **sectarian withdrawal** and **civil religion**, commending a **post-Constantinian** yet socially constructive discipleship for the **church**.

Chaplin is equally attentive to the **ecclesial** dimension. While rejecting a coercive **establishmentarian** settlement, he refuses a privatized **free church** model that abandons the public square. The **church** possesses its own **sphere sovereignty** to preach, catechize, discipline, and diaconally serve, and it should form citizens capable of **public vocation**. On establishment in contexts like England, he argues for a trajectory toward a **post-establishment** arrangement that honors **religious equality** and the **public witness** of multiple traditions, while respecting the historical contributions of **Anglicanism**. Theologically, he frames the church’s political posture as **eschatologically modest**. The state cannot sacralize national identity, and the church cannot outsource its mission to the state. Yet in the economy of **providence**, the state can be an instrument of **temporal justice**, and the church can summon the state to repentance through **confessional speech** in the public realm.

Crucial to Chaplin’s project is his comparative analysis of **sphere sovereignty** and **subsidiarity**, which clarifies his divergences from both **Catholic social teaching** and **liberal individualism**. He welcomes **subsidiarity** as an ally to decentralization and local initiative, but insists that it must be embedded within a thicker **plural sovereignty** that recognizes the intrinsic authority of non-state institutions. This guards against a paternalistic state that merely delegates downward what it ultimately owns. It also resists reducing society to **aggregated individuals** whose rights are then managed by the state. The **normative thrust** of his proposal is that the **juridical aspect** of reality binds the state to regulate inter-societal justice, resolve conflicts of competence, and uphold a basic matrix of **rights** and **responsibilities**, while refraining from directing the inner life of **churches**, **families**, **universities**, and **firms**. This is a political application of a creationally rooted **plurality-in-order**, the hallmark of **Neo-Calvinist** social thought.

Chaplin’s debates with secular political theory sharpen his constructive edge. With **Rawls**, he disputes the ideal of **public reason** as a gatekeeping norm for admissible arguments, preferring a standard of **civic accountability** that can encompass confessional argumentation. With **Habermas**, he partly agrees that religious citizens may need to become translators in certain forums, yet resists any secular veto over **religious reasons** at the point of decision. With **Taylor**, he appreciates the **immanent frame** and the historical genealogy of **secularity**, while insisting that the shape of late-modern **pluralism** requires structural protections for **religious associations** as associations, not only as private choices. With **Wolterstorff**, he shares a rights-based account of justice, but he accents the institutional task of **public justice** as the telos of the state and embeds rights within a **Reformational ontology** of spheres. With **O Donovan**, he agrees on the divine judgment of politics but pushes further structural differentiation to curb the integrative ambitions of any single institutional power. These engagements situate Chaplin within a living conversation that keeps **Neo-Calvinism** from becoming a static system and makes it a generative, dialogical posture toward **modern democracy**.

Finally, Chaplin’s proposals yield concrete policy orientations flowing from **principled pluralism**. He supports robust **institutional religious freedom** for schools, social services, medical institutions, and charities, within bounds set by **public justice** and **basic rights**. He calls for constitutional arrangements that secure **freedom of association**, protect **conscience**, and permit **faith-based participation** in government partnerships without ideologically leveling conditions. He urges electoral and governmental reforms that enhance **subsidiarity-like** dispersal of power while honoring **sphere sovereignty**, including devolution, independent regulatory agencies with clear limited mandates, and legal recognition of **civil society** bodies as partners rather than contractors. He also advocates a generous yet principled **immigration and integration** policy respectful of **deep diversity** and hostile to both **assimilationist** coercion and **relativist** indifference. Throughout, the criterion remains the state’s duty to safeguard **public justice**, not to engineer virtue or secure theological orthodoxy.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Chaplin’s **Neo-Calvinist** vision rightly prizes **creation order**, **common grace**, and the creational goodness of differentiated **social spheres**, offering a theologically rich correction to **statism** and to a thin **liberal neutrality**. His defense of **confessional candor** in public life coheres with **Reformed** confidence in the authority of **special revelation** and the legitimacy of **Christian practical reason** within a shared civic field. Yet tensions emerge when measured by classical **Reformed orthodoxy** as articulated in strong **two-kingdoms** or **establishment** streams. First, his account of state **religious neutrality** tilts toward a procedural agnosticism that some will judge unstable, since the **magistrate** in Reformed confessionalism has a ministerial duty under **natural and revealed law** to promote true religion while refusing coercion in faith. Second, his appeal to creational normativity, though not Thomist, functions like a **natural law** platform for consensus; critics within a **Van Tilian** or **Westminster** frame will warn that the **antithesis** undermines any thick public moral grammar apart from the **covenantal revelation** of God. Third, the priority of **institutional religious freedom** may under-protect the church’s unique claims in relation to the **civil realm**, blurring the older **duplex regimen** distinction between the spiritual government of Christ in the church and temporal civil order. A Reformed alternative would stress a more explicit **covenantal architecture** in which the magistrate acknowledges divine law, protects the church’s ministry as a distinct polity under Christ, and orders public life by a more determinate account of **natural law** as clarified by **Scripture**. Nevertheless, Chaplin’s emphasis on **public justice**, the limits of the **state**, and the legitimacy of **confessional speech** offers a disciplined, theologically serious path for Christian democratic engagement within pluralist polities.
