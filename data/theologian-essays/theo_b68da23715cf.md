### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Benjamin Myers emerges within the early twenty-first-century **evangelical** and **Anglo-Australian** theological landscape, a milieu marked by renewed **ressourcement** and **postliberal** suspicion of bare doctrinal rationalism. His long-running blog **Faith & Theology** from 2005 placed him among a public cohort who learned theology by conversing with **Augustine** and **Athanasius** as readily as with **Karl Barth** and **Rowan Williams**, staging an accessible yet rigorous **patristic retrieval** for a digitally literate generation. Methodologically he practices what he commends: a catechetical reading of Scripture by the **regula fidei**, a thick account of doctrinal language governed by **worship** and **prayer**, and an **apophatic reserve** that refuses to master the mystery of God apart from **Christology** and the **Trinity**. The result is a coherent stance in which the **Apostles Creed** functions as a canonical map of the gospel, an **ordo doctrinae** that steers evangelical confession away from atomized beliefs toward ecclesial memory and **classical orthodoxy**.

At the level of theological epistemology Myers is neither foundationalist nor purely narrative; he trades in what the fathers called *mystagogy*, a pedagogy of initiation into the **mysteries** of faith. His writing fuses **lex orandi lex credendi** with a Barthian insistence that God is known in His self-revelation in **Jesus Christ**, and yet his idiom remains cheerfully catholic, rehearsing **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** grammar with a simplicity designed for catechumens. He is a lay catechist for scholars and a scholarly guide for lay catechists, convinced that **dogmatics** must be ecclesial, prayerful, and tethered to the **creed** as a rule of reading.

#### 2. Christ the Stranger and the apophatic habit
Myers first came to wide academic notice through **Christ the Stranger: The Theology of Rowan Williams** in 2012, a sympathetic yet critical portrait of **Rowan Williams** as theologian and archbishop. The book is a sustained exposition of Williams’s **apophatic Christology**, his insistence that the identity of God is disclosed under the sign of **Christ’s strangeness**, particularly the crucified and risen one who resists domestication. Myers reads Williams as an heir to **Gregory of Nyssa**, **Augustine**, and **Athanasius**, and as a conversation partner of **Karl Barth**, especially on the primacy of **revelation** and the caution toward **natural theology**. The Christ who unsettles our speech becomes, for Myers, the normative boundary for all doctrinal discourse: the grammar of **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **salvation** can be said truly only as it is said within the life of prayer and the ascetical attention Williams commends.

This early monograph yields two lasting methodological habits in Myers’s own constructive work. First, he retrieves **apophatic reserve** not to mute doctrine but to purify it, pressing toward doxological predication that honors **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** while keeping the predicates saturated by the history of **Jesus**. Second, he treats theology as a craft embedded in ecclesial practices, aligning with Williams’s emphasis on **holiness**, **martyrial witness**, and the community’s speech as an enactment of what it confesses. These habits will later shape his catechetical exposition of the **Apostles Creed**, where mystery is not shunned but properly handled.

#### 3. The Apostles Creed as catechetical ordo
With **The Apostles Creed: A Guide to the Ancient Catechism** in 2018 Myers pivoted from monograph to catechesis, offering brief luminous meditations on each clause: **I believe**, **God the Father almighty**, **maker of heaven and earth**, **and in Jesus Christ**, all the way to **the resurrection of the body** and **life everlasting**. He reads the creed as a distillation of the **rule of faith**, drawing frequently on **Irenaeus** for the narrative arc of creation to new creation, on **Athanasius** for the soteriological import of the **incarnation**, and on **Augustine** for the affective depths of **belief** as trust and belonging. The key is that creed is not an abstract checklist but a doxological script that trains desire, a practice of saying **amen** to God’s own **gospel**.

Organizing doctrine by the creed allows Myers to reintegrate topics often fragmented in evangelical pedagogy. Under **Father almighty** he introduces **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** as grammar for God’s life, clarifying that almightiness means the free plenitude of **triune love**, not arbitrary power. Under **maker of heaven and earth** he insists on **creation ex nihilo** as sheer gift, thereby grounding **providence** and **Sabbath** in the gratuity of God’s act. Under **Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord** he unfolds classical **two-natures** Christology in direct patristic idiom, affirming **homoousios** with the Father and derivative humanity from **Mary** by the **Spirit**. The clauses on **crucifixion**, **descent to the dead**, and **resurrection** become for him the center that interprets the whole: the *pascha* of the Lord is the economy in which all divine names and acts are known.

#### 4. Descended to the dead and the paschal shape of doctrine
A signature theme in Myers’s creed exposition is the article **He descended to the dead**, which he treats neither as speculative geography nor as mere liturgical flourish, but as the logic of Christ’s solidarity with the human condition unto its terminus. Attentive to **1 Peter 3**, the patristic **harrowing of hell** tradition, and modern reticence to over-inflate the imagery, Myers reads the descent as the final depth of **Christ’s humiliation**, the sabbath stillness of **Holy Saturday** before the victory of **Easter**. In this frame, the descent safeguards the universality of Christ’s reach, just as the **resurrection of the body** safeguards the created goodness that God refuses to abandon.

The paschal structure then radiates outward. **Atonement** is taught doxologically as victory, reconciliation, and substitution gathered as one event in the crucified and risen Lord, allowing readers to receive **penal substitution** as one necessary strand without eclipsing **Christus Victor** or **recapitulation** in **Irenaeus**. **Justification** and **sanctification** are read as participation in the resurrected life of **Christ** by the **Spirit**, already and not yet, culminating in the creedal hope of **life everlasting**. The coherence is not systematic in the scholastic sense but catechetical: each clause confers a vista on the one gospel, and each vista is anchored in the **Trinity** unveiled in the paschal mystery.

#### 5. Ecclesial shape: lex orandi and the communion of saints
Myers’s doctrinal retrieval is inseparable from an ecclesial vision signaled in the creed’s **communion of saints**, **forgiveness of sins**, and **one holy catholic church**. He advocates **lex orandi lex credendi** not as a slogan but as a method: doctrine arises from and returns to **worship**, so that the church is formed by praying the creed and reading Scripture in that light. The **sacraments** figure as enacted words that seal the same gospel proclaimed by the creed, with **baptism** as incorporation into the death and resurrection of **Christ**, and **Eucharist** as foretaste of the **kingdom**, aligning him with patristic and ecumenical convergences on sacramental ontology.

In Myers’s hands, ecclesiology is modestly political. Following lessons from **Rowan Williams**, he frames the church’s public presence as hospitable witness rather than cultural conquest, an embodied apologetic of **holiness** and **mercy**. The creed’s affirmation of **forgiveness of sins** becomes a social ethic of patience in a world of recrimination, while the **communion of saints** becomes practice in memory and hope against the temptations of novelty and despair. The **saints** and **fathers** are not museum pieces; they are interlocutors whose speech makes our speech more faithful to **Scripture**.

#### 6. Scripture within the rule of faith
Throughout his catechesis Myers models how **Scripture** functions as the supreme norm within the **regula fidei**. He does not offer a treatise on **bibliology** so much as a demonstration: biblical phrases saturate each creedal clause, while patristic voices like **Athanasius** and **Augustine** are invoked as guides in rightly dividing the word of **truth**. His Barthian undertow surfaces here in a gentle reluctance to construct a natural knowledge of God apart from revelation, and in a Christological concentration that binds **Old** and **New Testament** around the one **gospel**.

This scriptural method is also ascetical. Myers leans on practices of **attention**, **contemplation**, and **repentance** as hermeneutical virtues, echoing **Gregory of Nyssa** and **Evagrius**. The Bible is read to conform readers to **Christ**, not to furnish detachable theorems. Yet the effect is not anti-doctrinal; on the contrary, this patterning yields sturdy affirmations of **divine simplicity**, **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **resurrection**, the very pillars of **classical theism** that many evangelicals now struggle to articulate.

#### 7. Style, genre, and public theology
Myers writes with aphoristic compression and pastoral warmth, a style honed in the short-form idiom of the **blog** and distilled in his catechetical books on the **Apostles Creed** including the 2022 children’s volume **The Apostles Creed for All God’s Children**. The genre choices are themselves theological: doctrine should be sayable by the church in prayer, teachable to children, and livable in ordinary vocations. He mentors readers in the craft of speaking the **faith** succinctly without trivializing mystery, translating **patristic** insight into contemporary idiom while safeguarding the thickness of the tradition.

In public engagement he exhibits measured **evangelical** instincts tempered by catholic breadth. The retrieval of **creed**, **saints**, and **liturgy** runs alongside an evangelical concern for conversion, Scripture, and **mission**. He shares with **John Webster** a longing for God’s holiness to reground theology as a spiritual act, and with **Robert Jenson** an ear for narrative coherence, yet he avoids speculative extensions by constantly returning to the **creedal** limits and permissions. The result is a public theologian whose simplicity is achievement rather than naïveté.

#### 8. Doctrinal contributions and distinctive emphases
Several doctrinal accents distinguish Myers within contemporary **evangelical** theology. He rehabilitates **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** under the name of the **almighty Father**, clarifying these not as negations of love but as the grammar that keeps divine love free, faithful, and eternally triune. He foregrounds **creation ex nihilo** as doxology, which reframes debates about **providence**, **evil**, and **human agency** by stressing God’s non-competitive causality, a note consonant with **Aquinas** yet delivered in patristic cadence. He makes **Holy Saturday** and the **descent** a theological hinge, recovering the cosmic reach of Christ’s work and the depth of his solidarity with the dead.

In soteriology Myers holds together **atonement** motifs without reduction, letting **Scripture** and **creed** set the polyphonic key. He resists partisan narrowing of **penal substitution** or **Christus Victor**, insisting that the one cross-reality cannot be dismembered. Ecclesiologically he advances **communion of saints** and forgiveness as practices that train political patience, a quiet protest against modern **individualism** and **resentment**. Across these loci, the **Apostles Creed** functions not as ceiling but as scaffolding, supporting faithful construction within the limits of **orthodoxy**.

#### 9. Influence, reception, and Reformed/WTS evaluation
Myers’s influence is out of proportion to his page count, owing to the reach of the **blog**, the catechetical clarity of **The Apostles Creed** in 2018, and the pedagogical appeal of the 2022 children’s volume. Pastors, catechists, and teachers have found in him a trustworthy path back into **patristic** and **creedal** grammar without abandoning evangelical sensibilities. His sympathetic reading of **Rowan Williams** trained a generation to see **apophatic** humility as theological courage rather than evasion, while his creedal work offers tools for rebuilding **Trinitarian** and **Christological** speech in local churches hungry for depth.

From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, much commends itself: Myers’s robust **Trinitarianism**, affirmation of **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**, insistence on **creation ex nihilo**, and paschal reading of **Scripture** resonate with classical Reformed orthodoxy. Tensions arise where his **apophatic reserve** and creedal minimalism may under-specify matters central to Reformed confessional identity. A **Scripture-principium** accent would press for clearer articulation of **inspiration**, **inerrancy** as truthfulness under God, and the sufficiency of Scripture over and under **tradition**. Likewise the Reformed **covenant** architecture, law-gospel relation, and the specificity of **penal substitution** as judicial center of the **atonement** could be overshadowed by his integrative plural accents. On **descent to the dead**, Reformed readers aligned with **Westminster** scruples may prefer the descent’s interpretation as burial and state of death rather than a harrowing motif, for the sake of biblical economy and caution. Finally, while Myers’s ecclesial practice echoes **lex orandi lex credendi**, a Reformed alternative would foreground **Word and sacrament** ministry under Christ’s **covenant** lordship as the principal medium of doctrinal formation. Even so, within these principial contrasts, Myers offers a salutary ally for renewing catechesis, securing **classical theism**, and re-centering evangelical theology on the **Apostles Creed** as a pedagogical rule in service to the supreme authority of **Holy Scripture**.
