- Interlocutors and influences: **I. A. Richards**, **F. R. Leavis**, **James Joyce**, **Wyndham Lewis**, **Harold Innis**, **Eric Havelock**, and Catholic resources in **Thomas Aquinas** and **lex orandi, lex credendi**.
- Reformed cue: test **no-neutral-media** against **sola Scriptura**, **regulative principle**, **second commandment**, and **Van Tilian antithesis**; discern how **form-content unity** conditions proclamation and catechesis.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Catholic conversion, and the Toronto School
Born in 1911 in Edmonton and raised in the prairie West, **Marshall McLuhan** moved through **Manitoba 1933-1934** to **Cambridge 1934-1943**, absorbing **I. A. Richards** and **F. R. Leavis** in close reading, and completing a dissertation on **Thomas Nashe and the learning of his time 1943**. In 1937 he entered the Roman Church, a conversion inflecting his mature categories with **Catholic sacramentality**, the **medieval trivium** of grammar, dialectic, rhetoric, and a sense of the **incarnation as communication**. His early teaching at **Saint Louis University 1937-1944**, where **Walter J. Ong** studied with him, and then at **Assumption College** and **St. Michael's, Toronto**, placed him within the **Toronto School** of communications. Here **Harold Innis** on time- and space-biased media and **Eric Havelock** on orality and literacy introduced the historical depth that would inform **acoustic space** and **typographic man**. The mid-century arrival of **radio, television, and global advertising** gave his work its urgency: not simply new tools, but new **environments**. Theologically, these are environments with liturgical power, shaping **lex orandi, lex credendi**, such that the form of communication becomes a formative **medium of belief**.

#### 2. Method as formal cause, figure and ground, mosaic and probe
McLuhan’s method is a retrieval of **Aristotelian formal causality** applied to technologies. He insisted that while efficient and material causes explain production, the **form of a medium** constitutes an environment that shapes perception, community, and cognition. This is the axiom behind **the medium is the message**. He reframed inquiry through **figure-ground analysis** drawn from Gestalt psychology: the explicit content is figure, the ambient environment is ground. Because grounds are invisible through familiarity, he advanced a **mosaic method** of discontinuous aphorisms and images as **probes**, seeking what he called pattern recognition. Theologically, this aligns with the difference between **signum and res** in sacramental theology, and with the Augustinian insight that **habitus** is formed by repeated practices more than by explicit propositions. He also deployed **acoustic vs visual space** as a comprehensive contrast: acoustic space is simultaneous, resonant, and communal; visual space, from writing and especially print, is linear, sequential, and individualizing. This polarity functions for him as a kind of **analogia communicationis**, a structured set of relations in which each new medium re-configures the entire field.

#### 3. Advertising, myth, and the critique of literate complacency
His first major work, **The Mechanical Bride 1951**, is a dense album of ads and commentary. Here **mass advertising** is read as a modern **mythopoesis** that clothes machines and commodities with archetypal desire. The famous McLuhan theme of **extensions and amputations** appears: when a medium extends human faculties, it simultaneously **amputates** competing capacities. The car extends mobility, amputating neighborhood life; television extends vicarious sight, amputating print-centered reflection. He analyzes the **fetishization of the female body** in ads as a ritual that domesticates technique by sex and humor, a liturgy of **commodity sacramentality** where the sign eclipses the thing. The theological stakes are clear: the shift from **icon** to **idol** happens when the sign no longer participates analogically in a reality but becomes self-referential. Against modern complacency that content is king, McLuhan displaces moralizing by a **formal ecology** in which content is a meat baited to distract while the **delivery system** transposes habitus. For pastors and catechists this names the often neglected **liturgical power of media forms** in shaping desire prior to doctrinal assent.

#### 4. Typography, nationalism, and the Reformation in The Gutenberg Galaxy
The seismic claim of **The Gutenberg Galaxy 1962** is that **print technology** generated a new **visual space** whose line-by-line sequencing fostered **individualism**, **nationalism**, and the **fragmentation** of formerly oral, communal cultures. Building on **Havelock** and **Innis**, he locates the alphabetization of Greece and the later **typographic revolution** as cultural hinge-points. He provocatively connects the **Reformation** to the print-driven ideal of **private judgment**, **sola Scriptura on the page**, and the rise of **Protestant hymnody** that embeds texts in standardized meter. He does not reduce Protestantism to print, but he argues that print made possible a distinctive **mentalité** in which linear causality, exact repeatability, and specialist abstraction gained prestige. The book’s mosaic of citations and glosses performs its thesis; it enacts a **typographic self-critique** through **acoustic aphorism**. The theological provocation is twofold: first, the **perspicuity of Scripture** may be entangled with typographic habits of clarity; second, ecclesial polities may unconsciously mirror the **information architecture** of their dominant media. The retrieval of **acoustic space** does not mean abandoning literacy, but recognizing the **ecclesial price** paid for print’s gains.

#### 5. Understanding Media and the canons of hot and cool, extension and retribalization
In **Understanding Media 1964**, McLuhan consolidates his most famous categories. The aphorism **the medium is the message** names the priority of form over content. The canon of **hot and cool media** classifies media by sensory saturation and audience participation: **radio, film, and print** as hot, strongly filled in and low in participation; **telephone and television** as cool, sparse and high in participation. With **electric media**, instantaneous global circuitry undoes typographic isolation and reintroduces **retribalization**, the **global village** marked by proximity and pressure without necessarily securing neighborliness. He describes media as **extensions of man** that produce compensatory **amputations** and as **self-amputations** that numb pain. Theologically, the ekklesia must reckon with **amputations** induced by its chosen forms, as when microphone amplification reconfigures **preaching** from dialogical proclamation to staged performance, or when livestreaming extends visibility yet amputates **koinonia**. McLuhan’s insistence that moral valuation rides on **discernment of formal effects** rather than content alone anticipates later explorations of **liturgical formation**, resonating with Augustinian and Reformed concerns for the **ordo amoris** even as it unsettles content-centric catechetics.

#### 6. War and Peace in the Global Village, From Cliche to Archetype, and the spiritual undercurrent
The later 1960s crystallize McLuhan’s apocalyptic and spiritual register. **War and Peace in the Global Village 1968**, designed with **Quentin Fiore**, is a photo-text montage staging **pattern recognition** as pedagogy. **From Cliche to Archetype 1970**, with **Wilfred Watson**, explores the oscillation between **cliché** and **archetype** as media environments are overextended and then flip, a pattern later formalized as **reversal in the tetrad**. His interviews and lectures increasingly invoked **Eucharistic participation**, the **incarnation** as the primal **medium of revelation**, and the Church as the community uniquely trained to navigate **acoustic and visual space**. The posthumous collection **The Medium and the Light 1999** gathers these explicitly religious lines, where the **sacramentum et res** frame helps read technologies as occasions of **grace or idolatry**. He rarely theologizes in a scholastic key, but the grain of **Aquinas on signum** and a Catholic sense of **lex orandi, lex credendi** peeks through. The pastoral implication is that media environments are not adiaphora; they are **ascetical fields** with a spiritual price tag.

#### 7. Laws of Media, the tetrad, and the dynamics of reversal
With his son **Eric McLuhan**, the posthumous **Laws of Media 1988** articulates the **tetrad** of questions that every medium answers: What does it **enhance**? What does it **obsolesce**? What does it **retrieve** from older forms? What does it **reverse into** when pushed to its limit? The tetrad is a compact **formal-causal heuristic** that renders visible the **figure-ground flips** characteristic of environments. Applied to the smartphone, for example, it enhances **ubiquitous connection**, obsolesces **bounded attention**, retrieves the **itinerant letter** and the **prayer bead** as tactile routines, and reverses into **surveillance and isolation**. Theologically the tetrad equips discernment of **pastoral means**, where amplification enhances audibility, obsolesces **congregational voice**, retrieves the **town crier**, and reverses into **spectatorship**. The tetrad resists single-cause moralizing and instead displays **complex tradeoffs** that require prudence. Its Aristotelian temperament, attentive to **form and telos**, offers a grammar by which ecclesial leaders can audit media as **habitus-shaping powers** within the *saeculum*.

#### 8. Theological horizons: incarnation, icon, and ecclesial media asceticism
McLuhan’s theological horizon is consistent: the **incarnation** is the definitive instance where **medium and message** are one. Christ as the **Word made flesh** is the divine refusal of a content-form split; hence the world is a network of **analogical signs** that both reveal and conceal. In this frame the problem of **idolatry** is not images per se but the misuse of images when **form eclipses referent** or when content denies the **economic form** God has chosen in **Scripture, preaching, and sacrament**. His polarity of **acoustic and visual space** maps onto the Church’s struggle to order **hearing and seeing**, **kerygma and icon**, **memory and spectacle**. He does not provide ecclesiology, but he supplies a **media asceticism**: choose forms that train the senses for **charity and contemplation** rather than for speed and outrage. This asceticism is not Luddite but analogical: deploy **technics** as **servant-signs** whose boundaries are acknowledged and whose amputations are compensated by **communal disciplines**. The best readers of McLuhan have been **Walter Ong** with his orality-literacy studies and Catholic thinkers who receive him as a **cultural doctor** rather than as a systematic theologian.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation: Word, form, and covenantal discernment
A Reformed evaluation meets McLuhan at several strong points while sharply qualifying others. His axiom **no neutral media** aligns with **Van Til's antithesis** and the insistence that **revelation** confronts a fallen world that constantly **suppresses the truth** through idols, including technological ones. His **formal-causal analysis** exposes what a **regulative principle of worship** also knows: **form and content** are covenanted, and media are already liturgies. His warnings about **images that dominate hearing** echo the **second commandment** and a Reformed iconoclasm that safeguards the **primacy of the Word**. Yet McLuhan’s **technological determinism** at times underestimates **covenantal agency**, the Spirit’s **efficacia verbi** in and through weak media, and the way **special revelation** norms and can discipline the media that carry it. His linkage of the **Reformation** to **typographic man** is illuminating but reductive, ignoring pre-print **lectio continua**, catechetical orality, and the doctrine of **perspicuity** grounded in God’s clarity rather than in print’s linearity. A WTS retrieval would affirm his **tetrad** as prudential tool, but subject all media to the **means of grace** and to a **two-kingdoms or pilgrim** restraint. It would advocate **media asceticism** ordered to **Lord’s Day worship**, prioritize **ordinary means** over spectacle, and frame technology within **covenant**, **vocation**, and **Sabbath** as alternatives to the restless **global village** that often replays **Babel** more than **Pentecost**.
