### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Guillaume Bignon emerges as a contemporary voice at the intersection of **analytic philosophy of religion** and Evangelical theology, narrating a late-modern return from French secularism to Christian faith. His 2022 memoir, **Confessions of a French Atheist**, situates his conversion in an intellectual climate shaped by the **New Atheism**, biblical criticism, and a technocratic confidence in scientific naturalism. Against this backdrop, Bignon develops a philosophically disciplined defense of **Calvinist compatibilism** that refuses the dichotomy between analytic rigor and ecclesial confession. His method aligns with the Anglo-American tradition of **philosophy of action** and moral responsibility, drawing on **Harry Frankfurt**, **John Martin Fischer**, and **Derk Pereboom**, while his doctrinal moorings sit with **Jonathan Edwards** and **Paul Helm** on **meticulous providence**. The resulting posture holds the **Scripture principle** and confessional orthodoxy together with the modal clarity of contemporary analytic argument.

Bignon’s epistemic stance is unapologetically theological yet analytically framed: Scripture and catholic Reformed dogma specify the metaphysical contours of **divine decree** and **concursus**, while questions about freedom, blame, and evil are handled by the best tools of **analytic metaphysics** and **action theory**. He distinguishes God’s *ad intra* simplicity and aseity from God’s *ad extra* providential rule, refusing to collapse primary causality into creaturely efficient causes. Within this framework, he interrogates libertarian claims about **sourcehood**, the **principle of alternate possibilities (PAP)**, and **ultimate responsibility**, contending that human moral responsibility supervenes on reason-guided agency rather than leeway freedom. The hallmark of his method is the marriage of biblical exempla such as **Genesis 50:20** and **Acts 2:23** with technical analyses of **bypassing**, **manipulation**, and **reasons-responsiveness**.

#### 2. Core project and major work
The organizing thesis of Bignon’s 2018 monograph, **Excusing Sinners and Blaming God**, is that classical **Calvinism** entails a robust theological determinism, yet preserves human blameworthiness and excludes divine culpability for evil. He addresses three pressure points in the literature: the **Consequence Argument** of **Peter van Inwagen**, which purports to show that determinism eliminates control; the family of **manipulation arguments** from **Derk Pereboom** and others, which allege that determined agents are no better than puppets; and the theological worry that meticulous providence renders God morally blameworthy. Bignon’s strategy is unapologetically analytic and cumulative: dismantle leeway-based demands for responsibility, ground responsibility in **guidance control** and **reasons-responsiveness**, and articulate a principled asymmetry between divine ordination of sinful acts and divine blameworthiness.

In so doing, Bignon offers a Calvinist recasting of themes long associated with **Jonathan Edwards, Freedom of the Will** and modern analytic compatibilism. Where **Edwards** framed moral necessity with psychological determinism and the nature of volition, Bignon appropriates the more recent framework of **Fischer and Ravizza** on moderate **reasons-responsiveness** and the agent’s **ownership** of the mechanism that issues in action. He also leans on a robust doctrine of **divine concursus** to secure the universality of providence, anticipating objections about fatalism and the collapse of creaturely agency. The result is a logical defense, rather than a theodicy in the classic **Leibnizian theodicea** mode, yet his account does articulate moral reasons for God’s ordination of evils that avoid blaming God while sustaining the full demerit of sinners.

#### 3. Compatibilist freedom: PAP, sourcehood, and reasons-responsiveness
At the heart of Bignon’s compatibilism is a rejection of the necessity of **PAP** for moral responsibility. Following **Frankfurt** and subsequent refinements, he argues that the availability of an alternative possibility is not required for blame; what matters is that the agent’s action issues from a mechanism that is appropriately **reasons-responsive** and owned by the agent. On **Fischer and Ravizza’s** account, which Bignon endorses and modifies for theological purposes, responsibility attaches to guidance control rather than regulative control. Thus, even if determinism is true under **divine decree**, a sinner can be blameworthy for an action because the action tracks his grasp of moral reasons, displays his evaluative commitments, and manifests his character.

Bignon addresses **sourcehood** theorists such as **Robert Kane** and critics like **Alfred Mele** by distinguishing demandingly ultimate origination from the more modest claim that the agent is the immediate source of her action. He insists that the absence of leeway does not entail **bypassing** the agent’s rational capacities. The crucial disqualifier for responsibility is not determinism but interventions that bypass or subvert the agent’s deliberative faculties. This is where his analytic precision shows: he marks the difference between historical manipulation that implants pro-attitudes exogenously and the natural development of character under ordinary providence. In ordinary providence and **concursus**, God’s causality is primary and transcendent, enabling but not bypassing the agent’s rational powers, so that blame tracks ownership rather than metaphysical ultimacy.

#### 4. Manipulation, consequence, and bypassing
Responding to **Pereboom’s** four-case manipulation argument, Bignon grants that certain histories undercut responsibility because they involve subversive manipulation of the agent’s pro-attitudes. He argues, however, that theological determinism under **meticulous providence** need not share the responsibility-undermining features of nefarious manipulation. The divine creative and sustaining causality operates at a different categorical level than creaturely manipulations; it does not function as a local intervention in the agent’s psychology but as the primary cause in which the agent lives and moves. The key analytic move is to deny any illicit **transfer of blame** from a necessary condition to a culpable cause and to highlight the morally relevant absence of **bypassing** in typical cases of ordinary sin.

Against the **Consequence Argument**, Bignon follows compatibilists in challenging the inference from the fixity of the past and the laws to the absence of control. He presses objections to the **modal transfer** principles underwriting the argument and insists that responsibility is compatible with the truth of counterfactuals of freedom determined by God’s decree. Here he is in tacit conversation with **Paul Helm** and classical Reformed talk of **decretum** and **concursus**: the decree fixes the whole order of events, but the fixity of the order does not deprive agents of acting according to their reasons-responsive natures. Thus, determinism under decree is unlike coercion or compulsion, and unlike **manipulation** in which a second agent replaces the deliberative basis of action with alien control.

#### 5. Divine involvement in evil and the asymmetry of blame
The most theologically delicate strand of Bignon’s project is his explicit defense of divine determination of sinful acts without divine culpability, the titular dilemma of **Excusing Sinners and Blaming God**. He articulates a principled asymmetry between God’s ordination of sin and human wrongdoing by parsing distinct normative levels: what is good for God to will *simpliciter* in the governance of history can include permitting or ordaining creaturely sins for greater goods, while it remains evil for creatures to will those same acts under finite, creaturely norms. The asymmetry is grounded in God’s unique relation to ends and means, the Creator’s prerogatives, and the order of **primary-secondary causality**. He appeals to biblical patterns such as **Genesis 50:20** and **Acts 4:27-28** as loci for double-agency explanations that preserve full human guilt alongside the fulfillment of the **divine decree**.

To make the asymmetry precise, Bignon deploys deontic distinctions between de dicto and de re justification and uses the notion of a **defeater** for blame. If God’s ordination of a given sin is aimed at a wise and holy providential end, then God possesses an overriding moral reason unavailable to the creature. The creature’s intention remains disordered by the moral law, while God’s intention is ordered to the summum bonum of divine glory. This allows Bignon to claim that God’s ordination neither violates divine holiness nor turns God into the author of sin. The analytic notion of **bypassing** returns here as a guardrail: God’s concurring causality upholds and coordinates the creaturely act without inserting a corrupting intention into the human will. The dialectical effect is not to render **theodicy** unnecessary but to refocus it as a defense, undercutting the charge that Calvinism implicates God in moral evil.

#### 6. Scripture, confession, and doctrinal integration
Although his argumentative style is analytic, Bignon anchors his claims in the Reformed **confessional** articulation of **providence** and **decree**. The catechetical formulas of **WCF 3** and **WCF 5** are the doctrinal scaffolding from which he reasons: God ordains whatsoever comes to pass, yet neither is God the author of sin, nor is violence offered to the will of the creatures. Passages like **Romans 9** are deployed to showcase a Pauline compatibilism in which divine hardening and human responsibility coexist without contradiction. He reads such texts through the lens of **double agency**, reinforcing a Chalcedonian instinct in providence that refuses confusion or separation of primary and secondary causation.

In line with **Reformed scholastic** categories, Bignon is sensitive to the distinction between God’s **voluntas beneplaciti** and **voluntas signi**, between secret will and revealed command. This enables him to defend a robust divine sovereignty while preserving the normativity of the moral law for creatures. With **Jonathan Edwards**, he affirms that moral necessity is consistent with blameworthiness, though he translates Edwards’s psychology into the contemporary lexicon of **guidance control** and **reasons-responsiveness**. The net effect is a doctrinal integration in which **compatibilist freedom** is not an alien import but a conceptual articulation of long-standing Reformed commitments about human sin, the **ordo salutis**, and God’s **meticulous providence** over all events.

#### 7. Apologetic extension: faith, evidence, and providence
Bignon’s 2022 narrative, **Confessions of a French Atheist**, extends his project into the terrain of **apologetics**, blending testimony with arguments for God’s existence, the **resurrection**, and the **reliability of the Gospels**. The work displays an Evangelical **cumulative-case** sensibility, echoing moves familiar from **Alvin Plantinga** and **William Lane Craig**, yet it retains Bignon’s **Calvinist** soteriology and a frank acknowledgment of the **noetic effects of sin**. Here too providence and responsibility intersect: the grace that overcomes unbelief does not bypass rational agency but restores and directs it, an evangelistic application of the same **bypassing** constraint that shapes his compatibilism.

This apologetic dimension also widens his repertoire of interlocutors, as he engages naturalists on **moral realism**, skeptics on **miracles**, and libertarians on **free will** in connection with evil. He treats **Molinism** critically as a proposed solution to foreknowledge and providence, arguing that **middle knowledge** either collapses into determinism or smuggles in the very indeterminacy that nullifies divine control. The apologetic payoff is to secure confidence that Christian theism is not only existentially compelling but also conceptually coherent on the hardest questions of **evil**, **freedom**, and **grace**.

#### 8. Distinctive contributions and ongoing debates
The distinctiveness of Bignon’s voice lies in bringing the fine-grained tools of **analytic action theory** to bear on a distinctly **Reformed** doctrine of God. Unlike generic free-will defenses, his model offers a **compatibilist defense** of the coexistence of evil and divine sovereignty, showing how **Frankfurt-style cases** and **reasons-responsiveness** can be drafted into service of **meticulous providence**. He contributes to ongoing debates by specifying when and why **manipulation** undermines responsibility, by refining the grammar of **ownership** and **bypassing**, and by clarifying the non-culpable character of **divine involvement in evil** through deontic and teleological asymmetries. In this, he stands alongside figures like **Paul Helm** while translating older themes from **Edwards** into contemporary argument forms.

The reception of his work within Evangelical and Reformed circles has been appreciative precisely for this clarity. Pastors and philosophers alike have found in **Excusing Sinners and Blaming God** a map through the thickets of **van Inwagen’s** fatalist worries and **Pereboom’s** manipulation scenarios. At the same time, his willingness to state bluntly that God determines sinful actions has made him a lightning rod for critics who favor **libertarian freedom**, **Molinist** providence, or a more reticent approach to **theodicy**. These debates keep his project situated at the live edge of contemporary **analytic theology**, where metaphysics, exegesis, and confession meet.

#### 9. Scope and limits, with an eye to classical theism
Bignon’s project presupposes the metaphysics of **classical theism**. He affirms a robust **Creator-creature distinction**, the **aseity** and **immutability** of God, and a transcendent model of primary causation that is not coordinate with creaturely causality. This underwrites his constant claim that God’s determining decree does not compete with creaturely agency but founds it. Nevertheless, the very ambition to spell out **divine involvement in evil** raises questions about how to speak of God’s causality without infringing **divine simplicity** or **impassibility**, especially when mapping divine and human intentions in single events like the crucifixion. Bignon handles this by focusing on the normative asymmetry and by maintaining that God’s willing of evil events is always per accidens relative to holy ends, yet he leaves to classical dogmatics the deepest accounts of **actus purus** and the mode of God’s willing.

Moreover, the analytic categories of **reasons-responsiveness** and **guidance control** are theory-laden and not without dissenters. Some will press that genuine **sourcehood** requires agent-causal resources alien to Bignon’s compatibilism; others will question whether his **bypassing** criterion fully answers **historical-responsibility** concerns, particularly in cases of total depravity and ingrained vice. Still, his work shows an unusual sensitivity to these challenges by linking analytic criteria to the Reformed doctrines of **original sin** and **common grace**, suggesting that responsibility does not require pristine moral histories, only the integrity of rational agency as upheld by **concursus**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed and WTS vantage point, Bignon’s account exhibits substantial strengths and a few pressure points. Positively, he offers a clear, conceptually disciplined defense of **meticulous providence** that aligns with **WCF 3 and 5**, secures **compatibilist freedom** without diluting creaturely guilt, and resists attempts to saddle **divine decree** with moral blame. His use of **Frankfurt-style cases**, **reasons-responsiveness**, and the **bypassing** constraint fortifies the Reformed affirmation that God’s sovereign rule does not violate the will of the creatures. He honors the **Creator-creature distinction** in a manner consonant with **Van Tilian** commitments, and his refusal to ground apologetics in neutral reason coheres with a covenantal posture that views unbelief through the lens of **noetic sin**. The concerns are principled rather than programmatic. First, the language of **divine involvement in evil** must be tethered carefully to **primary-secondary causality**, lest rhetoric obscure the classical commitment to **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and the non-competitive mode of God’s **actus purus**. Framing God’s willing of sinful acts per accidens to holy ends should be disciplined by the scholastic distinctions of **voluntas beneplaciti/signi** and the patristic instinct that God is not one cause among others. Second, while his analytic account of responsibility is powerful, a WTS emphasis on **redemptive-historical** and **covenantal** categories would supplement it with **federal headship**, **union with Christ**, and the **covenant of works/grace** as the deeper theological theater in which human responsibility and divine sovereignty are enacted. Third, in theodicy, a Van Tilian preference for revelational starting points counsels reticence about speculative goods, recommending a doxological defense anchored in **Romans 9**, **Job**, and **the cross** rather than an explanatory theodicy. On balance, Bignon’s project sits comfortably within classical Reformed orthodoxy, offering a philosophically exact defense of **providence** and **responsibility**, while inviting further integration with the doctrines of **God**, **covenant**, and **redemption** that constitute the Reformed system.
