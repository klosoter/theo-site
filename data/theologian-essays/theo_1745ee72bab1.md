### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The career of **Jason S. DeRouchie** unfolds within the late twentieth and early twenty-first century resurgence of **evangelical biblical theology** grounded in **inerrancy** and trained exegesis for the church. Educated at **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary** with a PhD completed in 2007 under the influence of **Daniel I. Block** and other Old Testament scholars, he was formed at the confluence of **Deuteronomic theology**, **canonical shape**, and **mission to the nations**. His institutional homes at **Bethlehem College & Seminary** and later **Midwestern Baptist Theological Seminary** placed him in a network marked by **John Piper**'s emphasis on expository rigor and doxological purpose, often summarized as exegesis for exultation. This context positioned DeRouchie to champion the **Old Testament** as Christian Scripture that must be read through the lens of the **Messiah** and the **new covenant**, with robust claims about **divine authorship** and the organic unity of the canon.

Methodologically, DeRouchie operates with a clearly articulated **grammatical-historical** approach that self-consciously expands to a **canonical** and **redemptive-historical** horizon. He insists that because Scripture has both a human and a **divine author**, the text bears intertextual and typological trajectories that reach their telos in **Christ** without collapsing the integrity of original contexts. His work repeatedly invokes **Luke 24** and **2 Corinthians 1:20** to justify a **Christocentric** reading, yet he guards against arbitrary allegory by rooting **typology** in textual patterns, covenantal structures, and the Bible's own reuse of motifs. The epistemic stance is confessional and ecclesial: **inerrancy**, **clarity**, and **sufficiency** frame expectations; the interpretive rule is the **analogia fidei**, and the practice is a disciplined movement from exegesis to **biblical theology**, to **systematic theology**, to application.

A characteristic pedagogical contribution is his twelve-step model in **How to Understand and Apply the Old Testament** 2017, where he sequences textual criticism, discourse analysis, word studies, historical-cultural setting, literary structure, intertextuality, and typology before synthesis and ministry application. This method, indebted to and dialoguing with **G. K. Beale** on intertextuality and **Peter J. Gentry** on covenantal structures, grounds DeRouchie's claim that **divine intent** unfolds across the canon and that the interpreter is responsible to trace these patterns to **Christ** and the **church**.

#### 2. Works, canon, and the Old Testament as Christian Scripture
DeRouchie's corpus coheres around making the **Old Testament** pastorally accessible while maintaining academic rigor. As general editor of **What the Old Testament Authors Really Cared About: A Survey of Jesus's Bible** 2013, he frames the canon according to the **Hebrew tripartite structure** of **Torah, Prophets, and Writings**, sometimes called Jesus's Bible, and highlights how each section bears forward the **kingdom** and **messianic** hope. The volume offers a theologically integrated survey that refuses both fragmentation and flattening, situating prophetic hope and wisdom instruction within the covenantal storyline from **creation** to **new creation**. In the same year he co-edited **For Our Good Always: Studies on the Message and Influence of Deuteronomy** 2013, signaling his sustained investment in **Deuteronomic theology** as a linchpin for understanding prophetic judgment, exilic hope, and new-covenant promise.

His **Deuteronomy: A 12-Week Study** 2018 in Crossway's Knowing the Bible series models his teaching craft: the **book of Deuteronomy** is read as covenant preaching that climaxes in the call for **heart circumcision** and anticipates a **prophet like Moses**. These motifs are then tracked into the **Gospels** and **Acts**, where **Jesus** emerges as the covenant mediator who obeys, embodies, and fulfills the law, and where the **Spirit** writes the law on the heart. His recent **Delighting in the Old Testament: Through Christ and For Christ** 2024 synthesizes decades of classroom and church work, advocating that Christian joy, mission, and holiness are impossible without savoring the **Old Testament** in its Christ-focused unity. The leitmotif is doxological: the Old Testament is for **worship**, **wisdom**, and **witness** when read through the **crucified and risen** Lord.

Central to DeRouchie's canonical argument is attention to the macro-structure and the theology of book order. He argues that the **Hebrew canon** ends with **Chronicles**, not **Malachi**, and that this ending accentuates return-from-exile hope, **Davidic** restoration, and temple-centered worship under **YHWH**'s kingship. This canonical frame intensifies rather than diminishes the **messianic expectation**, inviting readers to see the **Gospels** as narrating the long-awaited resolution. The **Torah**'s covenant architecture, the **Prophets**' lawsuit and promise idiom, and the **Writings**' wisdom and lament thus interlock as an intentional preparation for **Christ**, not as a random anthology.

#### 3. Law, covenant, and the new-covenant ethic
DeRouchie's most debated doctrinal contribution concerns **law and covenant**. He contends that the **Mosaic covenant** as a historical legal package has reached its **telos** and thus is not the direct covenantal authority over Christians, a stance resonant with **progressive covenantalism** and sometimes labeled **New Covenant Theology**. He interprets **Romans 10:4** as indicating that **Christ** is the goal and end of the law, and **Galatians 6:2** and **1 Corinthians 9:21** as identifying a distinct **law of Christ** operative in the **new covenant**. The moral norms of the **Decalogue** abide insofar as they are taken up and rearticulated by Jesus and the apostles, but the legal form of the **Sinai code** has been superseded. He is explicit that the **Sabbath command** is transformed, not abolished as a moral reality, yet reconfigured around **resurrection-rest** and **Spirit-empowered** life rather than a calendrical seventh day obligation.

This framework rests on his reading of **Deuteronomy** and the prophets as projecting a future **heart circumcision** and **Spirit** inscription that yields obedience from the inside out, not from the coercive externality of the old administration. The **new covenant** community is thus defined by regenerate members, internalized law, and global mission, fulfilling the **Abrahamic** call to bless the nations. In this rendering, the **Mosaic covenant** had a temporary typological function, pointed to by its sacrificial system, priesthood, and land laws, which find fulfillment in **Christ's priesthood**, the **once-for-all sacrifice**, and the **new creation** inheritance.

He presses his law-covenant reading into ecclesiology and sacramental practice. Because **circumcision of heart** is the covenantal requirement, he argues for **credobaptism**, asserting that **baptism** signifies union with **Christ** and entry into the **new covenant** by faith rather than serving as a sign and seal of an Abrahamic administration inclusive of infants. The **people of God** are one across the covenants in purpose and grace but differ in covenantal constitution; the **church** is the eschatological people marked by **Spirit**-wrought faith and obedience. This coheres with his interpretation of **Jeremiah 31** and **Hebrews** as distinguishing the unbreakable new covenant from the breakable old.

#### 4. Typology, intertextuality, and mission
DeRouchie's hermeneutic leverages **typology** as covenantally embedded pattern recognition, not free-floating allegory. From **Adam** and **Noah** through **Abraham**, **Moses**, **David**, and **Zion**, he traces escalating motifs that point forward to **Christ** and the **church** as the temple people. Influenced by **G. K. Beale** on temple and new creation and by **Stephen Dempster** on canon and dominion, he argues that the Bible itself teaches readers how to see type and antitype, employing the **New Testament** as an inspired commentary that authorizes and models such readings. His practice of **intertextuality** highlights strategic textual allusions and echoes, especially in **Matthew**, **Hebrews**, and **Revelation**, to show how the **Old Testament** finds its Christological completion.

At the pastoral-theological level, this typological and canonical vision fuels **mission to the nations**. The **Abrahamic promise** of universal blessing is, for DeRouchie, the centrifugal force driving biblical history toward Pentecost and beyond. His teaching and writing underscore that the **Great Commission** stands on the shoulders of **Deuteronomic** covenantal witness and **Isaianic** servant theology. The church's vocation to disciple the nations is therefore not a New Testament novelty but the outworking of **YHWH's** ancient designs. The ethical entailments of this mission are framed by the **law of Christ** and the **fruit of the Spirit**, drawing practical lines on **sanctity of life**, **sexual ethics**, and **justice** as the vision of **new creation** life intrudes into the present age.

His synthesis also engages the scholarly guild. Against **critical scholarship** that fragments **Deuteronomy** or the **Deuteronomistic History** into late ideological layers, DeRouchie argues for compositional coherence, theological intentionality, and historical rootedness, aligning with confessional **inerrancy** and the reliability of biblical historiography. Against classical **dispensationalism**, he resists sharp Israel-church dichotomies and affirms one people of God under the **new covenant**; against some expressions of **covenant theology**, he questions reading the **Sinai administration** as a stable moral-civil-ceremonial tripartite law directly norming the church. His interlocutors include **Peter J. Gentry** and **Stephen Wellum** on **progressive covenantalism**, **Thomas R. Schreiner** on **law and gospel**, and **John Piper** on the doxological end of exegesis.

The pedagogical center of gravity in **How to Understand and Apply the Old Testament** 2017 illustrates these commitments in practice. Word studies are yoked to **discourse analysis**, historical background to **canonical** horizons, and theology to **application** in the church. The capstone is a repeated insistence that interpreters must show how the **Old Testament** leads to **Christ** and then to transformed life in the **Spirit**. In **Delighting in the Old Testament** 2024, this method becomes doxology: the church is summoned to love the law as **fulfilled in Christ**, to pray the **Psalms** as the prayers of the **Messiah** and his body, and to own the **Prophets** as the church's eschatological hope.

In sum, DeRouchie's theological biography is the story of an evangelical OT scholar discipled by **Deuteronomy**, championing **canonical unity**, and laboring to equip pastors and missionaries with a **Christ-centered** Old Testament. His corpus is not a systematic theology in the classical sense but a coherent practical-theological program integrating **exegesis**, **biblical theology**, and **churchly** mission. The result is a compelling portrait of the **Old Testament** as indispensable Christian Scripture, to be read with rigor and joy through the lens of the **new covenant**.

Reformed and Westminster evaluation: Many in the **Reformed** tradition, including those shaped by **Westminster Theological Seminary**, will commend DeRouchie's robust **divine authorship**, **redemptive-historical** method, and disciplined **typology**, along with his emphasis on the **Torah-Prophets-Writings** canon and the doxological end of theology. Tensions surface over his **law of Christ** construct and his criticisms of the classical **moral-civil-ceremonial** distinction, his reconfiguration of the **Sabbath**, and his **credobaptist** restriction of **new covenant** membership. A Westminster alternative would retain his Christocentric and canonical strengths while reaffirming the abiding normativity of the **Decalogue** as the summarized **moral law**, the creation and redemption rationale for a Christian **Sabbath**, and the unity of the **covenant of grace** administered under **Abraham** and **Christ** to believers and their children. Within classical Reformed orthodoxy, one can grant that the **Mosaic economy** is typological and fulfilled, yet still ground continuity by the Decalogue's trans-covenantal authority and sacramental inclusion, thereby safeguarding both the once-for-all **Christological** fulfillment and the abiding **moral** voice of Sinai for the church's life and mission.
