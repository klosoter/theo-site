### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and vocation
John Wyatt emerges as a leading evangelical voice in contemporary bioethics from within the crucible of **neonatal medicine** and the British **National Health Service**. Trained as a clinician and serving for decades as consultant neonatologist at University College Hospital in London, then as Emeritus Professor of **Neonatal Paediatrics** at University College London, he confronted the moral fault lines opened by technologically enabled survival and death. In the decades after **Louise Brown** in 1978, the first IVF birth, the United Kingdom saw expanding reproductive technologies, contested end-of-life decisions after the **Tony Bland** judgment of 1993, and the normalization of **utilitarian** bioethics in law and policy. Wyatt's Christian convictions, nurtured through the **Christian Medical Fellowship** and scholarly work with the **Faraday Institute** in Cambridge, pushed him to develop an approach that could speak with clinical credibility and theological depth. His enduring thesis is that a credible public bioethics, grounded in **sanctity-of-life** and the **imago Dei**, can be practiced as wise care for the vulnerable in the face of the **technological imperative**.

Wyatt's formation as a clinician-scholar sets his method apart. He refuses the abstraction of armchair ethics and the reductionism of bloodless theory. Instead he conducts moral reasoning in the ward and the tribunal, with the crying infant and the anxious family in view. From there he reaches for the long arc of Christian moral reflection, retrieving the **Hippocratic Oath** and the biblical narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation. Unlike projects that anchor public bioethics in thin consequentialism or unbounded autonomy, Wyatt insists that the **telos of medicine** is covenantal fidelity to the fragile neighbor, shaped by the **Incarnation** and the **cross**. The result is a distinctive fusion of clinical realism and theological anthropology.

#### 2. Method and theological anthropology
Wyatt's method begins with **theological anthropology**. Human beings bear the **imago Dei**, created for communion with God and neighbor, embodied, finite, sexual, and destined for resurrection. The dignity of human life is not a function of rational capacity or manifest independence, but arises from divine gift and relational vocation. Wyatt repeatedly contrasts a **sanctity-of-life ethic** with a **quality-of-life calculus**, arguing that the latter betrays those whose worth is not legible to market logic or strict utilitarian metrics. The pattern of Christ's **kenosis** and **agape** shapes the meaning of compassion, which for Wyatt never entails intentional killing but rather presence, relief of suffering, and truthful care.

Methodologically, Wyatt is bilingual. He argues in the church with **biblical theology**, and he reasons in the public square with conceptually accessible criteria like **proportionality**, **futility**, and **best interests**, while still signaling their roots in *caritas* and *phronesis*. He appropriates the **doctrine of double effect**, distinguishing intended ends from foreseen but unintended side effects, not as a blanket license but as a moral lens that keeps intention morally salient. His debt to **Oliver O'Donovan** on resurrection and moral order and to **Paul Ramsey** on covenant fidelity in medicine is apparent, as is his critical distance from **Peter Singer** and **John Harris** on personhood. Wyatt's moral epistemology reflects evangelical confidence in Scripture's sufficiency, a chastened respect for **natural law** prudence, and an awareness of the **noetic effects of sin** in the clinic and the legislature.

#### 3. Matters of Life and Death
Wyatt's most influential synthesis is **Matters of Life and Death**, a first edition in 1998 and a substantially revised edition in 2009. The work surveys abortion, embryo research, reproductive technologies, genetics, neonatal intensive care, and end-of-life decisions, offering a unified **sanctity-of-life** vision. He argues that a human organism from conception possesses moral status because of **continuity of identity**, inherent **potentiality**, and divine calling under the **imago Dei**. The book carefully details embryological development to undercut the personhood line-drawing favored by secular bioethics, engaging the claims of **Singer** and **Harris** with empirical and moral counterarguments. On embryo research and destructive experimentation, Wyatt concludes that intentional instrumentalization of nascent life violates the Christian commitment to protect the least, aligning with a thick view of **human dignity**.

On reproductive technology, **Matters of Life and Death** distinguishes therapeutic interventions that assist marital procreation from procedures that sever procreation from the **one-flesh covenant**. Wyatt critiques the routine generation and freezing of surplus embryos in IVF and rejects third-party gamete donation because it fragments biological and covenantal bonds, though he is not absolutist about every laboratory technology. Throughout he invokes **precautionary** humility before unknown harms, the reality of **structural injustice** and eugenic pressures in screening regimes, and the urgent pastoral need to accompany infertile couples with **hope** and **truthful counsel**. The book's tone is neither technophobia nor technophilia, but a sober insistence that technology must serve **human flourishing** under God.

#### 4. Neonatal ethics at the edge of viability
Wyatt's clinical home turf is the morality of care at the threshold of life, where twenty-two to twenty-five week infants hover between survival and death. He resists both absolutist vitalism and cost-driven rationing by articulating **proportionality** and **futility**. Treatments that impose grave burdens without reasonable hope of benefit can be withheld or withdrawn as part of faithful medicine, yet the intentional ending of life remains proscribed by the **Hippocratic** and Christian commitment to do no harm. The morally relevant difference for Wyatt lies in **intention versus foresight**. Withdrawing disproportionate ventilation when it no longer serves the child's **best interests** is not the same as killing, though it may foreseeably hasten death.

In practice Wyatt commends a **trial of life** approach, initiating intensive care when potential benefit is plausible, reassessing as evidence unfolds, and engaging families in truth-telling, prayerful presence, and shared decision-making. He works to recalibrate hope away from technological mastery toward **relational fidelity**. He strengthens the case for **palliative care** for neonates, rejecting the false dichotomy between cure and care. Against the **technological imperative** he urges clinicians to cultivate *phronesis*, to honor **parental responsibility** without surrendering professional integrity, and to resist a drift toward eugenic normalization disguised as compassion.

#### 5. End-of-life care and the right to die
In **Right to Die**, published in 2015, and in **Dying Well**, 2018, Wyatt advances a comprehensive Christian response to euthanasia and assisted suicide. He contests the claim that **autonomy** is the supreme moral good, showing how requests to die can mask depression, fear of being a burden, or social loneliness. He catalogs the empirical record from the **Netherlands** and **Belgium**, where permissive euthanasia regimes have expanded from terminal illness to chronic suffering, psychiatric distress, and even non-voluntary cases, as evidence of cultural **slippery slope** dynamics. For Wyatt, authentic **compassion** means the hard work of accompaniment, symptom control, and ritual care, not the creation of a right to be made dead.

Ethically he draws a line between **killing and letting die**, reading intention as morally decisive while insisting on robust palliative measures including proportionate sedation. He engages legal debates in the United Kingdom, including the 2015 parliamentary defeat of assisted dying proposals, and articulates grounds for **conscientious objection** for clinicians who refuse to facilitate deliberate life-ending. Pastoral chapters in **Dying Well** translate his ethics into practices of lament, forgiveness, and hope, showing how the **resurrection** relativizes death's tyranny without denying its sting. His doctrine of dying well becomes an ecclesial catechesis in **mortality**, not merely a hospital policy.

#### 6. Technology, AI, and the posthuman horizon
Wyatt has expanded his scope to the frontiers of **artificial intelligence** and **transhumanism**, most notably through **The Robot Will See You Now** in 2021, edited with the theologian **Stephen N. Williams**. He affirms the God-given goodness of **technoscience** while mapping its distortions under sin, a duality he frames as creation order and idolatrous **techno-utopianism**. In healthcare he analyzes algorithmic decision support, datafication, and robotic care, warning against the **depersonalization** of patients and the erosion of professional judgment. Machines can augment diligence and pattern recognition, but they cannot bear **agape**, nor can they replace the moral agency required for covenantal care.

Against **posthuman** dreams of erasing finitude and engineering immortality, Wyatt reasserts **embodied finitude** as a gift and the resurrection as the only secure eschatology of healing. He recommends design ethics that embed **human oversight**, **justice for the marginalized**, and transparent accountability in AI systems. Here again his method pairs public, technically literate analysis with the **imago Dei** as the lodestar of non-negotiable dignity. He positions the church to engage tech culture not with fear but with disciplined discernment and hopeful critique.

#### 7. Public engagement and interlocutors
Wyatt's public posture is dialogical yet uncompromising. He debates with **Peter Singer** and **John Harris** on personhood and moral status, refusing the exclusion of the severely disabled from the human community. He draws from **Oliver O'Donovan** the theological grammar of resurrection order in ethics and from **Paul Ramsey** the language of covenant and **fidelity**. He finds allies among **palliative care** pioneers and opponents among euthanasia advocates such as **Helga Kuhse** and **James Rachels** with their defense of no moral distinction between killing and letting die. Wyatt offers a robust critique of **Raanan Gillon's** four principles bioethics when principlism is abstracted from thick moral commitments, even as he redeploys **beneficence** and **nonmaleficence** inside a **sanctity-of-life** frame.

His institutional platforms, especially the **Christian Medical Fellowship** and the **Faraday Institute**, demonstrate how to build intermediate communities of practice where Christian clinicians and scientists can reason together about **science and faith**. Wyatt's frequent use of case studies and narrative exemplars trains moral perception, not merely rule compliance. He forms consciences capable of resisting the **technocratic** drift of modern health systems while cooperating in common grace where genuine goods are at stake.

#### 8. Conceptual contributions and doctrinal threads
Several conceptual contributions stand out across Wyatt's corpus. First is a rearticulation of **sanctity-of-life** that is neither sentimental nor merely emotive, but dogmatically grounded in the **imago Dei**, the **Incarnation**, and the **resurrection**. Second is a positive account of **dependency** as constitutive of personhood, a theme that challenges liberal subjectivity and undergirds strategies of **hospitality** to the unborn, the disabled, and the dying. Third is the retrieval of **intention versus foresight** for bedside ethics, a disciplined way to honor the prohibition of killing while permitting aggressive symptom control and the withdrawal of **disproportionate** interventions.

Fourth is the embedding of **proportionality and futility** within a Christian account of **phronesis**, defusing the charge of vitalism without conceding to cost-effectiveness absolutism. Fifth is the framing of **medicine as covenantal practice**, a moral ecology of promises, communities, and institutions, where **trust** is both a virtue and a social good. Finally, Wyatt's sustained critique of the **technological imperative** contributes a pastoral hermeneutic of limits, embracing **embodied finitude** and resisting the denial of death. These themes are articulated not as esoteric doctrine but as guides to policy and praxis, showing that high theology can and must be operationalized in clinical life.

#### 9. Triage, justice, and recent crises
Wyatt's bioethics has been tested by crises such as the **COVID-19** pandemic. He argued for triage grounded in the equal worth of all persons and the prioritization of treatments by **clinical benefit**, not social value or disability bias. He cautioned against crude **utilitarian** scoring that smuggles discrimination into ostensibly neutral tools, and he urged transparent criteria, appeal mechanisms, and careful communication. The language of **ordinary and extraordinary means** reappeared in his counsel, as did a renewed call for **palliative care** access wherever life-sustaining treatment was not appropriate.

This concern for justice extends to global health. Wyatt highlights **structural injustice** in access to care and in research priorities that neglect the poor. His bioethics therefore is not merely about heroic medicine at the margins of life, but also about mundane **faithfulness** in resource allocation, public health measures, and the equitable distribution of burdens and benefits. He exhorts Christian professionals to practice **conscientious integrity** in institutions that often prize efficiency over mercy, and to articulate **public reasons** that can be heard in pluralist settings while remaining tethered to the church's confessional grammar.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed perspective, particularly within the **Westminster** stream, Wyatt's project exhibits substantial strengths and a few pressure points. Positively, his **creation-fall-redemption** framework, his insistence on **imago Dei** as the ground of inviolable dignity, and his principled rejection of **euthanasia**, **assisted suicide**, and **embryo destruction** cohere with **Reformed orthodoxy** on revelation and law. His account of medicine as **covenantal vocation** resonates with **sphere sovereignty** and with a doctrine of calling ordered to neighbor love under God's providence. His refusal to absolutize **autonomy** and his robust appeal to **noetic effects of sin** in clinical judgment align with Reformed anthropology. Questions arise regarding his appropriation of **double effect** and **proportionality**, which carry Thomistic lineage. These tools are morally useful, yet a Westminster framing would insist that intention analysis be subordinated to explicit **divine command** and that **ordinary versus extraordinary means** be articulated under the sixth commandment's positive duties to preserve life. Likewise, Wyatt's adept use of **public reason** could, in some settings, risk a minimalism that blunts the **antithesis** between covenantal wisdom and secular autonomy. A Reformed corrective would deepen the exegetical tethering of key norms, sharpen the covenantal logic of **parental headship** and ecclesial discipline in end-of-life counsel, and integrate **natural law** prudence under the primacy of **Scripture**. Even so, Wyatt offers a model of common grace engagement that is strategically wise and morally courageous, a resource to be gladly received and critically strengthened by classical **Reformed ethics** in the face of rapidly evolving biotechnologies.
