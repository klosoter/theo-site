### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and methodological wager
Sarah Coakley emerges as a distinctive Anglican voice whose synthesis of **patristic ressourcement**, **feminist critical theory**, and **ascetic spirituality** marks a fresh turn in contemporary systematic theology. Educated at **Cambridge** and appointed to senior posts at **Harvard Divinity School** and later as **Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity** at Cambridge in 2011, she inhabits the shifting terrain in which **postliberal retrieval**, **Radical Orthodoxy**, and **analytic philosophy of religion** contested the shape of **doctrine** and **reason**. Ordained in the **Church of England**, Coakley leverages ecclesial practice, especially **contemplative prayer**, as an epistemic engine for theology. Her hallmark method, which she names **theologie totale**, proposes that only a whole-person discipline of **askesis**, doctrinal reasoning, scriptural meditation, and **interdisciplinary inquiry** can purify the theologian's **desire** so that theological judgments may be true. With **apophatic theology** as a grammar of humility before divine mystery and **Gregory of Nyssa** as a guide of *epektasis*, she reconceives foundational loci by beginning with **pneumatological primacy**, claiming that the **Spirit's** pressure in prayer sets the terms for **Trinitarian** confession.

At stake in Coakley's methodological wager is a reconfiguration of **authority** and **rationality** in theology. Against constructions of **feminist theology** that read ascetic renunciation as simply collusion with patriarchal control, she contends that **ascetic contemplation** can perform a subversive redirection of **power** by relocating the subject within the **divine economy** of desire. Against versions of **analytic theism** that imagine reason's neutrality, she advances a **virtue-epistemic** claim that rightly ordered **affections** are constitutive of knowledge of God. And against **Barthian** suspicions of **natural theology**, she reopens the question of **general revelation** by integrating **evolutionary biology** and **ethnography** within a chastened, contemplatively disciplined account of the **created order**. The resulting horizon is Anglican in its **sacramental realism**, catholic in its **patristic** breadth, and strikingly contemporary in its traffic with **gender theory** and the **sciences**.

#### 2. Early interventions: body, power, and spiritual discipline
Coakley's early editorial and programmatic work, notably **Religion and the Body**, 1997, and **Powers and Submissions: Spirituality, Philosophy and Gender**, 2002, announces her signature themes of **body**, **power**, and **desire**. In **Religion and the Body** she foregrounds the theological importance of embodiment against a history of disembodied **spirituality**, deploying **anthropology** and **philosophy** to insist that **doctrine** must not bypass the complex social inscriptions of the **flesh**. In **Powers and Submissions** she critically engages **Michel Foucault** and **Judith Butler**, reframing **power** not merely as domination but as something that can be transformed within **ascetic practices**. Her retrieval of **monastic** and **patristic** sources argues that **submission to God** can destabilize human hierarchies by detaching **desire** from systems of coercion and reorienting it toward **divine love**. Across these essays Coakley crafts a theology of **eros** that refuses the dichotomy between **agape** and **sexual desire**, instead construing both as capable of sanctifying redirection under the pressure of the **Spirit**.

This early phase also consolidates two conceptual keys that recur in her later systematic work. First, an unwavering commitment to **apophatic reserve** as the condition for speaking of **God**, which simultaneously licenses bold metaphorical work on **desire** since such language operates under negation and purgation. Second, an insistence that the practice of **prayer** is never a private inwardness but a public, political act shaping the **church's** contestation of **gender** and **power**. By situating **ascetic contemplation** within liturgical and communal rhythms, Coakley aligns Anglican **catholicity** with a vigorous critique of clericalism, while preserving the possibility of genuinely **sacramental** participation in the **divine life**.

#### 3. Gregory of Nyssa and the apophatic erotics of Trinitarian desire
The patristic axis of Coakley's project revolves around **Gregory of Nyssa**, a fourth-century Cappadocian whose **epektasis** motif renders **desire** as endless movement into God. In **Re-Thinking Gregory of Nyssa**, 2003, and in numerous essays that prepare the ground for her later systematics, Coakley contends that **Gregory's** apophaticism does not negate **eros** but transfigures it into an everlasting ascent that is both purgative and unitive. By reading **Gregory** alongside **Augustine's** **ordo amoris**, she crafts a conceptual matrix in which the **Spirit** is the personal agent who dilates creaturely **desire** toward the **Son's** filial **desire** for the **Father**. This **pneumatological primacy** seeks to reconfigure standard Western trajectories that begin with **Christology** and move to **Pneumatology**, arguing instead for the hermeneutical priority of the **Spirit's** groaning in *Romans 8* as the experiential ground of **Trinitarian** confession.

The upshot is a reshaped account of **divine desire** that neither collapses God into human projection nor lapses into crude **passibilism**. Coakley wagers that a carefully controlled, **apophatic** use of **desire** language can illuminate the eternal **relations of origin** without compromising **divine transcendence**. The **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit** are not erotic in any creaturely sense, yet creaturely **eros**, under **ascetic discipline**, may be assumed and healed into a participation that analogically images **divine love**. Here the **analogia participationis** does much of the work. Acknowledging the limits of creaturely concepts through the *via negativa*, she proposes that **desire** is the fitting grammar for a **Trinitarian** metaphysic that refuses both rationalist mastery and emotivist collapse, holding **unity** and **distinction** in a tension choreographed by the **Spirit's** allure.

#### 4. God, Sexuality, and the Self: theologie totale and a Spirit-led Trinity
These threads culminate in the programmatic **God, Sexuality, and the Self: An Essay on the Trinity, vol. 1**, 2013, where **theologie totale** appears as a distinctive method. The book interweaves **biblical exegesis**, **patristic retrieval**, **ethnographic case studies**, and **philosophical analysis** to argue that **contemplative practice** provides the primary field in which **Trinitarian** truth is discerned. Coakley begins not with the **immanent Trinity** as a speculative construct, nor with a historical **Jesus** abstracted from worship, but with concrete practices of **silent prayer** in which the **Spirit** constrains speech, generates **desire**, and ushers the praying subject into the **Son's** relation to the **Father**. Placing **Romans 8** at the methodological center, she articulates a **pneumatological primacy** that recalibrates the order of **Trinitarian** knowing. The resultant Trinitarian model is apophatic yet richly figural, attending to scriptural **nuptial** and **erotic** imagery while carefully resisting **gendering** of the divine.

A distinctive feature of this volume is its bold theological anthropology of **sexual desire**. Coakley contends that no adequate **doctrine of the Trinity** can be constructed without confronting the dynamics of **human sexuality**, since **desire** is the medium in which the subject is seized by the **Spirit** and reoriented toward **God**. She challenges naïve churchly treatments of **marriage**, **celibacy**, and **ordination**, arguing for long-haul processes of **discernment** that are ascetically exacting and communally accountable. **Ethnographic vignettes** drawn from charismatic and contemplative communities function not as authoritative data that bind doctrine but as provocations that expose the need for theological attention to lived **pneumatology** and **power**. The volume thus performs **theologie totale** by refusing to insulate **dogmatics** from **prayer**, or **theory** from **embodied life**.

#### 5. The New Asceticism and the politics of desire
In **The New Asceticism: Sexuality, Gender and the Quest for God**, 2015, Coakley gathers essays that sharpen the ecclesial and political implications of her project. The titular call for **new asceticism** is not a rejection of embodiment but an insistence that contemporary regimes of **desire** require disciplines of attention, fasting, and **silence** to convert the will to **God**. Engaging **feminist theology**, she resists the binary between **complementarianism** and simplistic **egalitarianism**, insisting that both theologies are inadequate if they ignore the strenuous **askesis** by which the church learns to name and renounce **idolatrous desire**. She rehearse critiques of clerical **power**, explores the plausibility of **celibacy** and **marriage** as vocations under the primacy of the **Spirit**, and reimagines **ordination** debates through an ascetical lens. The theological claim is that the **Spirit's** sanctifying pressure unfolds as a liturgical politics in which status, gender, and sexuality are reconfigured by the **Trinitarian** desire that draws the church into **Christ**.

This ascetical politics returns us to the central grammar of **apophatic desire**, which Coakley carefully distinguishes from any privatized spirituality. The new asceticism is publicly verifiable in the church's **patience**, **practices of reconciliation**, and **hospitality** toward those on the margins of sexual and social distinctions. While indebted to **Rowan Williams** on **contemplation** as the deepest truth of the church, Coakley extends the point by insisting that the **Spirit's** groaning is the crucible of doctrinal formation. **Doctrine** emerges not as extrinsic regulation but as the grudging fruit of prolonged attention to God. This yields a theological habitus that refuses cheap resolutions, whether in progressive activism that outruns **ascetic discernment**, or in traditionalist retrenchment that mistakes well-policed borders for holiness.

#### 6. Sacrifice regained: evolutionary cooperation and a chastened natural theology
Coakley's **Gifford Lectures**, 2012, under the theme **Sacrifice Regained: Evolution, Cooperation and God**, widen the methodological arc to include **evolutionary theory**. Here she explores the conceptual space in which **altruism**, **sacrifice**, and **cooperation** function both as biological strategies and as theological signs. Through dialogue with theorists of **evolutionary cooperation**, she resists the reduction of **altruism** to mere genetic self-interest, arguing instead for a multi-level account that leaves room for the **Spirit's** transformative work. The proposal is not that **science** delivers God, but that a contemplatively purified **reason** can discern in the created pattern of **cooperation** a fittingness to the **Trinitarian** life that grounds all being. This becomes the crux of her chastened **natural theology**, which neither follows **Barth's** prohibition nor reverts to a precritical **analogia entis** deployed without ascetic conversion.

Linked to this is Coakley's rehabilitation of **sacrifice**. Against readings influenced by **René Girard** that equate **sacrifice** with violence pure and simple, she retrieves ancient and biblical dimensions in which **sacrifice** names ordered **desire**, self-offering, and Eucharistic participation. The **Eucharist** appears as the paradigmatic site where **cooperation** is enacted and the **Spirit** conforms the church to **Christ's** self-offering. This moves beyond apologetic supplement to the claim that the **church's** practices of **sacrifice** and **cooperation** are theologically basic for understanding **creation** and **salvation** as the generous overflow of **Trinitarian** desire. The wager is that a properly ascetical orientation to **science** can inform, rather than deform, the doctrinal loci of **creation**, **grace**, and **sanctification**.

#### 7. Prayer as epistemic crucible and the shape of doctrinal reasoning
Across her corpus Coakley develops a sustained argument about **theological epistemology**. The fundamental claim is that **contemplative prayer**, especially silent **adoration** and *lectio divina*, is the necessary crucible in which idolatrous projections are burned away and the **Spirit** orders **desire**. Knowledge of **God** is inseparable from **sanctification**. This aligns theology not only with **virtue epistemology** but with an erotic pedagogy drawn from **Gregory of Nyssa's epektasis** and **Augustinian** accounts of love. Hence **theologie totale** is as much a moral and spiritual regimen as an intellectual program. The theologian must attend to **gendered power**, to the **church's** complicities, and to the complex dynamics of **sexuality**, if she is to speak truthfully about the **Trinity** and **salvation**.

This epistemic emphasis reshapes the handling of **doctrine** throughout. **Trinitarian theology** is constructed not as a top-down imposition but as the disciplined discernment of the **Spirit's** pressure in the church's practices, verified in the transformed lives of the saints. **Christology** is approached through contemplation of the **Son's** filial **desire** and obedience, while **Pneumatology** receives methodological primacy as the field in which the **Triune** God is encountered. **Ecclesiology** emerges as a community of ascetical discernment, **sacramental** participation, and mutual **submission** before God. Coakley thus reanimates a catholic Anglican vision in which **worship**, **desire**, and **doctrine** mutually inform and purify one another.

#### 8. Interlocutors and disputes: Butler, Barth, analytic theism, and Radical Orthodoxy
Coakley's project advances through sustained engagement with major twentieth-century and contemporary **interlocutors**. With **Judith Butler** she shares an attention to the performativity of **gender**, yet she refuses the foreclosure of **metaphysics** and argues that **ascetic practice** can reperform **desire** in a way that resists both normativity-as-domination and normlessness-as-liberty. With **Michel Foucault** she appropriates the insight that **power** is ubiquitous and formative, but she contends that **pneumatological** empowerment can break cycles of domination by submission to **divine authority**. With **Karl Barth** she concurs that **revelation** is decisive for theology, yet she resists collapsing **creation** into sheer extrinsicity by advocating a chastened **natural theology** mediated by **prayer**. With **analytic theism** she shares a serious account of **rationality**, but she critiques its frequent neglect of **ascetic transformation** as a condition for rightly ordering concepts of **God**.

Her relationship to **Radical Orthodoxy** and to **Rowan Williams** is instructive. Like **Milbank** and others, Coakley retrieves **patristic** and **medieval** resources against secular reason's totalizing claims, yet she is less programmatically anti-modern and more willing to work with **social science** and **evolutionary biology**. With **Rowan Williams** she inhabits an Anglican **sacramental metaphysics** and a high valuation of **contemplation**, yet she presses more explicitly into the terrain of **sexuality** and **desire** as doctrinal drivers. In these dialogues her distinct contribution is to integrate **prayer**, **power**, **gender**, and the **Trinity** into a single field of vision, refusing the partition that would isolate doctrinal loci from the crucible of **ascetic** practice.

#### 9. Doctrinal contour and constructive payoff
The doctrinal contour that emerges from Coakley's work can be summarized as a Spirit-led, apophatic, ascetical **Trinitarianism** keyed to the healing of **desire**. **Creation** is seen as the generous overflow of **Trinitarian** love in which **cooperation** and **sacrifice** name both creaturely participation and theological grammar. **Sin** is a deformation of **desire** that entangles bodies and communities in rivalrous **power**. **Salvation** is the Spirit's reordering of **desire** through **contemplation**, **sacrament**, and communal **askesis**, conforming the church to **Christ** and drawing it into the **Father's** glory. **Ecclesial authority** is redescribed as an ascetically tested charism rather than an unexamined hierarchy, and **sexual ethics** is repositioned within the process of sustained discernment rather than as a quick casuistry. Methodologically, **theologie totale** enshrines a practice-first epistemic stance that binds theology to the concrete performance of **worship** and the vulnerable openness of silence before **God**.

The constructive payoff is a systematic vision that resonates with the wider **postsecular** moment while avoiding both privatized piety and deconstructive paralysis. By integrating **ethnography** and the **sciences**, Coakley claims to honor the created intelligibility of the world under **divine providence**, while by centering **contemplation** she seeks to keep talk of **God** accountable to divine reality rather than to our projections. The **apophatic erotics** of her **Trinitarian** account aims to underwrite the sanctification of embodied life, to purify theological speech, and to open ecclesial space for patient discernment in conflicted zones of **gender** and **sexuality**. Anglican in tone, catholic in range, interdisciplinary in method, her work stakes a distinctive claim on the contemporary **systematic** landscape.

In Reformed or Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Coakley's achievement in centering **prayer**, **ascetic sanctification**, and the primacy of the **Spirit** offers salutary reminders that knowledge of God is a **holy** affair, yet it raises principial tensions concerning **revelation**, **divine attributes**, and **nature and grace**. Her **theologie totale** risks displacing **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi if ethnography and the **sciences** carry co-ordinating weight rather than ministerial service under the canon. The grammar of **divine desire**, even when apophatically hedged, can blur the confessional clarity of **impassibility**, **aseity**, and **divine simplicity**, and her methodological **pneumatological primacy** may invert the classic order of **processions** and **missions**, where the **Spirit** proceeds from the **Father and the Son** and is known in and with the **Word**. Her chastened **natural theology** presses beyond a Reformed **covenantal** account of **general revelation** by reading **evolutionary cooperation** as theologically suggestive, where a Reformed alternative would insist that the **noetic effects of sin** render such inferences unsafe apart from **special revelation**. At the same time, Reformed theology can welcome her stress on the **means of grace** when tethered to **Word and sacrament**, her insistence that **sanctification** orders **desire**, and her retrieval of **Gregory** and **Augustine** under the sovereignty of **God's self-revelation** in **Christ**. A Reformed recalibration would receive contemplation as the fruit of **union with Christ**, guard **Trinitarian** speech by the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture**, and locate any appeal to **nature** within the covenantal frame of the **sensus divinitatis** governed by the **Word**.
