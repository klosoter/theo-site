### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Stephen Westerholm emerged as a leading evangelical interpreter of **Paul** within the contemporary academy, teaching for decades at **McMaster University** in Hamilton, Ontario. His scholarly formation took shape precisely as the field absorbed the shocks of **Krister Stendahl’s** 1963 essay on the **introspective conscience of the West** and **E. P. Sanders’s** 1977 thesis of **covenantal nomism**, developments that displaced older caricatures of **Second Temple Judaism** as legalistic and questioned a strictly **Lutheran** reading of **justification**. Working within this milieu, Westerholm adopted a historical-critical method disciplined by close attention to **lexical semantics**, comparative **Jewish** and **Greco-Roman** sources, and a controlled sense of the letter-to-letter logic of **Romans** and **Galatians**. Yet he refused reductionist conclusions. The upshot is a methodological equilibrium in which historical description serves, rather than erodes, the classic **forensic** claims of **justification by faith**.

Westerholm’s method is anchored by two commitments. First, to the integrity of **Paul’s argumentation** in its epistolary contexts, often beginning with the syntax and semantics of terms like **dikaiosyne theou** and **erga nomou**, and proceeding to the rhetorical flow of **boasting** and **reckoning** language in **Romans 3 to 4**. Second, to the thick, varied texture of **Second Temple** sources, from **Qumran** to **4 Ezra**, while resisting unwarranted harmonizations that would flatten **Judaism** into a single pattern of religion. The result is a hermeneutic that grants **Sanders** the point that Jewish soteriology was grace-shaped, even as it contends that **Paul** rejects justification by any **works of the law** not because Judaism was graceless, but because in the dawning of **Christ’s** righteousness a fundamentally new basis of **forensic acquittal** stands forth.

#### 2. Early studies and the turn to Paul
Westerholm’s first monograph, **Jesus and Scribal Authority** in 1978, set his baseline approach. There he probed the relation of **Jesus** to the **scribes**, weighing claims about **halakhic** authority and drawing careful lines between **legal** and **eschatological** claims in the Synoptic tradition. The study pressed him to differentiate sociological authority structures from soteriological determinations, a sensibility that later guarded his **Pauline** work from collapsing **justification** into community boundary maintenance. This early precision with **Jewish legal** discourse paved the way for his major contributions to debates on **law**, **righteousness**, and **faith**.

By 1988, in **Israel’s Law and the Church’s Faith**, Westerholm engaged the newly ascendant **New Perspective**. He credited **Sanders** for re-centering **Jewish grace** but insisted that **Paul**’s critique is not a protest against legalistic straw men; it is rather the divine verdict that for both **Jew** and **Gentile** all **erga nomou** fail to constitute a righteous status before **God**. The book’s core claim is that **Paul’s** negative statements about **law** must be read in light of the inversion whereby **Abraham** is justified apart from **works** as **Romans 4** foregrounds. Westerholm’s method here tied **Abraham’s faith** to the nature of **boasting** in **Romans 3**, arguing that it is not only boundary-markers like **circumcision** and **food laws** that are excluded. Rather, any human performance as basis for **forensic righteousness** is under the apostolic ban.

#### 3. Understanding Paul and the early Christian worldview
In **Understanding Paul** first published in 1997 and revised in 2004, Westerholm offered a more synthetic account of the **Pauline worldview**. Here his use of historical backgrounds serves to situate **Paul**’s **apocalyptic** horizon without absorbing justification into cosmic determinism. He tracks the logic from **sin** and **Adam** to **law** and **death** in **Romans 5 to 8**, underscoring the impotence of the **Torah** to produce the righteousness it commands, the reality of **simul iustus et peccator** as a pastoral-exegetical inference, and the arrival of the **Spirit** as the power by which the **law’s righteous requirement** is fulfilled in believers. The **righteousness of God** in this account is centrally the divine saving action that grants a righteous status, a reading he sees as convergent with elements of **Augustine** and **Luther**, though articulated with stricter attention to **Paul’s** lexicon and syntax.

This volume also exhibits Westerholm’s fluency with rival readings. He grants that **Stendahl** rightly flagged a problem in projecting modern guilt psychologies back onto **Paul**, yet he argues that **Romans 1 to 3** presents a real indictment of universal **culpable sin**. He acknowledges that **Dunn** and **Wright** have recovered the ecclesiological breadth of **Paul’s** mission to **Gentiles**, yet he rejects their construal of **works of the law** as merely boundary-markers. For Westerholm, the polemic excludes confidence in any works, because the problem is not only community identity but the more basic reality of divine **judgment** and **boasting** before the divine court.

#### 4. Perspectives Old and New: defending the Lutheran Paul with historical nuance
With **Perspectives Old and New on Paul** in 2004, Westerholm delivered his most influential statement. The subtitle, The Lutheran Paul and His Critics, names the project: a retrieval of **Augustine**, **Luther**, and **Calvin** as heuristic conversation partners, while mounting an exegetical defense of **forensic justification**. He rehearses the emergence of **covenantal nomism** and the ensuing **New Perspective**, surveys **Stendahl**, **Sanders**, **Dunn**, and **Wright**, and then argues that a historically realistic account of **Judaism** does not overturn **Paul**’s radical negation of **works** as basis for **righteousness**. The crucial anchor is **Romans 3.27 to 4.8** where **boasting** is excluded, **faith** is reckoned as righteousness, and **David’s blessedness** is described in non-imputative terms of forgiveness and non-reckoning of sin, which together entail a **status** granted, not a moral transformation achieved.

A striking contribution in this volume is his discussion of **pistis Christou**. Westerholm argues for the objective genitive, **faith in Christ**, on the grounds of contextual emphases on human believing in the **Galatians** and **Romans** passages, while affirming that **Christ’s obedience** is the ontological ground for the verdict. He also contends that **righteousness of God** in **Romans** is not reducible to **covenant faithfulness**, contra **Wright**, though he allows that divine faithfulness provides the narrative context. The lexical and syntactic case aims to keep **soteriology** and **ecclesiology** properly ordered: **justification** is a **forensic acquittal** into which **Gentiles** are included, rather than an ecclesiological badge with soteriological afterthoughts.

#### 5. Justification reconsidered and the limits of revision
In **Justification Reconsidered** in 2013, Westerholm sharpened his claims in short compass. Here he engages fresh proposals concerning **Pauline apocalyptic** and the **participationist** reading of **salvation**. Without denying **union with Christ**, he argues that **justification** is a distinct legal verdict that stands logically prior to transformation in **Paul**’s argumentation. The **law** diagnoses and condemns; **grace** acquits; the **Spirit** then empowers a new walk. This sequencing resists collapsing **justification** into a general notion of **deliverance**. He again pushes back against construals of **works of the law** as boundary-bound, underscoring that **Romans 4**’s point about **Abraham** is precisely that boasting based on any **works** is excluded so that **faith**, as the open hand receiving **gift**, establishes grace.

The book also revisits **pistis Christou**, confirming Westerholm’s reading while recognizing that the **faithfulness of Christ** theme remains properly Christological in **Philippians 2** and **Romans 5**. The key is terminological discipline: **faith** language in **justification** texts refers to the believer’s trust, and **obedience** language names **Christ’s** righteous action and its representative efficacy. By delineating these categories, Westerholm believes he safeguards **Paul’s** emphasis on the primacy of **grace** without diminishing the real **ethical** transformation signaled by the **Spirit** in **Romans 8**.

#### 6. Reception history and hermeneutics
A complementary strand of Westerholm’s career appears in **Reading Sacred Scripture** in 2016, co-authored with **Martin Westerholm**, where he curates classic texts in **patristic**, **medieval**, **Reformation**, and **modern** exegesis. The project shows his regard for the **Christian tradition** as a living resource while preserving his primary commitment to **historical exegesis**. Voices like **Irenaeus**, **Origen**, **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, **Luther**, **Calvin**, **Barth**, and **Bultmann** are allowed to sound on their own terms, indicating that Westerholm’s defense of **forensic justification** is not antiquarian proof-texting but a retrieval that has paid its historical dues.

This reception-historical sensitivity strengthens his **Pauline** work. By hearing **Augustine’s anti-Pelagian** notes and **Luther’s simul iustus et peccator** through historically controlled filters, Westerholm can both correct cruder Protestant narrations of **Judaism** and still argue that the **Reformation** got **Paul’s** core soteriological grammar right. In this way, retrieval and critique are yoked together, under the belief that **Scripture** shapes doctrine most fruitfully when read in concert with the best of the **tradition** and under the pressure of contemporary challenges like the **New Perspective**.

#### 7. Core doctrinal profile: law, righteousness, and faith
Across his corpus, Westerholm’s theological synthesis is clear. On **law**, he reads **Paul** as affirming the law’s goodness and divine origin while highlighting its incapacity to create **righteousness** in sinful humanity. The law accents **transgression**, catalyzes **boasting**, and yields **condemnation** under **Adam**; it also witnesses to the **righteousness** that comes in **Christ**. On **righteousness**, he yokes **righteousness of God** to God’s saving action that confers a righteous **status** on the ungodly. On **faith**, he stresses the non-meritorious character of trust in **Christ**, such that **boasting** is excluded and **grace** is established. On **justification**, he insists upon its **forensic** character, distinguishing it from **sanctification**, even as he affirms that **union with Christ** and the gift of the **Spirit** follow inevitably from the same Christ-event.

Further, Westerholm handles the **pistis Christou** debate and **works of the law** discussions as test cases for reading **Paul** with argumentative integrity. He maintains that the plural **works of law** in **Romans** and **Galatians** must denote deeds done in obedience to the **Torah** broadly construed, not merely ethnic boundary-markers, because the flow of thought targets any grounds for **boasting**. He equally contends that **faith in Christ** better captures **Paul’s** rhetorical aim of calling for responsive trust, while preserving the indispensable category of **Christ’s obedience** as the material base of the believer’s **justification** and the **new covenant** life.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and refinements
Westerholm’s debates with **Stendahl**, **Sanders**, **Dunn**, **Wright**, and **Räisänen** have the feel of respectful yet firm correction. He credits **Sanders** with overthrowing caricatures of **Judaism**, but he objects to drawing from that correction the conclusion that **Paul** never denies **works** as basis for **righteousness**. He acknowledges **Dunn**’s and **Wright**’s insistence on the ecclesiological mission to the **nations**, but he demonstrates from **Romans 3 to 4** and **Galatians 2 to 3** that **Paul** prosecutes a deeper anthropology in which even perfectly performed **works** would not justify. He recognizes the strengths of **Pauline apocalyptic** in highlighting divine initiative, yet he resists any rendering that absorbs **forensic justification** into an undifferentiated liberation schema. And across these engagements, Westerholm works to hold together **divine faithfulness** and **legal reckoning**, **participation** and **forensic status**, insisting that **Paul** maintains conceptual distinctions within a single **Christological** economy of salvation.

Later scholarship also sharpened themes already present in Westerholm. Interactions with trajectories like the **Paul within Judaism** school pressed the question of whether **Paul** critiques **law** from inside a Jewish frame or from a new-covenant reality that relativizes **Torah** for **Gentiles**. Westerholm’s answer has been consistent: the decisive shift is not sociological but **soteriological** and **eschatological**, located in the arrival of **Jesus the Messiah**, whose death and resurrection introduce a righteousness accessible by **faith** for **Jew** and **Gentile** alike, apart from **works of the law**.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Westerholm’s strengths are conspicuous. He defends **forensic justification** with exegetical care, guards the universality of **sin** and the impotence of **law**, and upholds **faith alone** as instrument, all of which resonate with **Calvin’s duplex gratia** and the confessional commitment to **imputation** and **law-gospel** clarity. His resistance to reducing **justification** to **ecclesiology** or to **participation** alone secures the decisive legal verdict. Still, two tensions remain. First, Westerholm’s program, shaped by historical-exegetical priorities, tends to underarticulate **union with Christ** as the integrative soteriological category cherished in **Reformed orthodoxy**, where **justification** and **sanctification** coinhere as distinct benefits of union. Emphasizing **forensic acquittal** as logically prior risks occluding union’s primacy as the ontological bond out of which both benefits flow. Second, his discussions of **righteousness** and **imputation** are generally sympathetic but refrain from dogmatic specification of **Christ’s active and passive obedience** as the ground of the believer’s status, a point the **Reformed** stress to preserve the fullness of **covenant** obedience fulfilled by the Mediator. A Westminster alternative would press these two lines together: retain Westerholm’s exegetical case against **works of the law** while embedding it in a thick **covenant theology** where **federal headship**, **imputed righteousness**, and **union with Christ** order the whole, thereby uniting **forensic** and **participatory** aspects without confusion or collapse.
