- A Westminster examiner will want you to show how **Turretin** exemplifies confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** in continuity with **Calvin** and anticipates **Bavinck** and **Hodge**.
- They will also expect you to nuance charges of **rationalism**, showing how his use of **scholastic method** still preserves **Sola Scriptura** and spiritual piety.

- Bring in **Calvin vs Turretin** to compare humanism and early Reformation exegesis with later **scholastic precision** in dogmatics.
- Use **Turretin vs Barth** to discuss **natural theology**, **Scripture**, and **predestination**, especially on **inerrancy** and the nature of **revelation**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Francis **Turretin** was born in **Geneva** in 1623 into an Italian Reformed family that had fled from **Lucca**, so his entire life is situated within a self-conscious bastion of **Calvinist** orthodoxy under pressure from **Roman Catholic** powers. Educated in Geneva, Leiden, Utrecht, and Paris, he absorbs the mature **Reformed scholastic** tradition of **Voetius**, **Rivet**, and the Dutch Nadere Reformatie, while also confronting **Cartesian** innovations in the universities. He returns to Geneva as pastor and professor of theology, ultimately shaping its Academy until his death in 1687, and his ministry stands between the heroic era of **Calvin** and the later mediating theology of his own son, **Jean-Alphonse Turretin**. His context is post–**Synod of Dort**, where the Reformed churches had largely settled the **Arminian** controversy but now faced both Roman counterattacks and new forms of **rationalism** and **Socinianism**.

The driving problem for Turretin is to secure and defend a full-orbed **Reformed orthodoxy** against a threefold threat: first, the **Roman Catholic** claim that the Reformation ruptured the church and destroyed sound doctrine; second, the **Remonstrant** and **Saumur** claims that classical predestinarian and federal theology must be softened; and third, the rising **rationalist** and **Socinian** tendency to subject the mysteries of the faith to autonomous **reason**. In the **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae**, he explicitly adopts an **elenctic** or refutational mode, constantly setting out *quaestiones* in order to defeat adversaries such as **Bellarmine**, **Socinus**, and **Arminius**. His theology wars on two fronts: he refuses a capitulation to Rome on **Scripture and grace**, and he refuses a capitulation to modernity on **revelation and mystery**. Theologically, he seeks to show that the Reformed system is both rigorously **biblical** and internally coherent, so that the doctrines of **Trinity**, **incarnation**, **election**, **atonement**, and **justification** form a harmonious whole grounded in the self-revealing God of Scripture.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Turretin's method is summarized by his commitment to **Sola Scriptura** and the ministerial use of **reason**, which he expounds at length in the first locus of the **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae**. He argues that **theology** is the doctrine of living well and blessedly to the glory of God, and that its formal principle is **divine revelation** given in **Scripture**, which is theopneustos and therefore the supreme and final rule of faith. Against **Rome**, he insists that Scripture is sufficient and perspicuous in things necessary for salvation, and against early **liberalizing** tendencies he defends both the verbal inspiration and the inerrancy of the autograph texts. At the same time he stresses that only the **Holy Spirit** can produce true theology in the heart, so that there is no access to God apart from **faith**, which itself is grounded in the internal testimony of the Spirit authenticating Scripture.

Within that framework, Turretin gives a sophisticated account of **reason**, **experience**, and **church** as subordinate sources. He distinguishes between reason as an instrument, which is necessary to draw good and necessary consequences from **Scripture**, and reason as a judge, which he denies any authority in theology when it sets itself above revelation. Against the more radical claims of **Cartesianism**, he refuses to ground certainty in the *cogito* or in clear and distinct ideas, and instead appeals to the self-evidencing light of **divine revelation** attested by the Spirit and by the marks of Scripture. He affirms a genuine **natural theology**, arguing from **Romans 1** that God is known by the light of nature as creator, and yet he constantly subordinates this **theologia naturalis** to the **theologia revelata** of Scripture, rejecting any *analogia entis* that would render the creaturely mind an intrinsic participant in divine being. The **church** and her **tradition** are for him important as witnesses and interpreters, particularly the early **fathers** and the Reformed **confessions**, but they never share the norming authority of the biblical canon.

Turretin also understands theology as historically located, and though he does not theorize **history** as a distinct theological source in the way later thinkers like **Vos** or **Barth** will, he is acutely aware of doctrinal development and controversy. The entire structure of the **Institutio**, with its **quaestiones** and refutations, presupposes that the church militant is engaged in ongoing conflict across time with recurring heresies such as **Arianism**, **Pelagianism**, and **Socinianism**. He invokes the **ecumenical councils** and Reformed **synods**, especially **Dort**, as historical concretizations of biblical truth, yet he will not attribute to them infallibility. In this way he preserves the classic Reformed position that **Scripture** alone is the *principium cognoscendi* in theology, while nevertheless practicing a richly historical and confessional method that stands in clear continuity with **Reformed scholasticism** and anticipates the later synthesis of **Bavinck**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline is that **Scripture alone** is the inspired, inerrant, sufficient, and perspicuous word of God, the only infallible rule of faith and practice. In the opening questions of the **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** Turretin systematizes this baseline with exceptional precision, especially in his distinction between the **formal** and **material** sufficiency of Scripture and his doctrine of **inspiration**. Against **Roman Catholic** apologists like **Bellarmine**, he contends that the canon is self-authenticating, that the church receives rather than constitutes the canon, and that oral tradition is not a necessary supplement in order to know the saving will of God. Against **Socinians** and emerging **rationalists** he insists that Scripture is not merely a human record of religious consciousness but the divinely breathed-out word that cannot err in any of its assertions. Though he allows for textual variants and acknowledges the need for textual criticism, he maintains that the authentic text is preserved in the traditional Hebrew and Greek copies used by the church, which reflects a strong doctrine of **providence** over the transmission of Scripture. His work here provides a cornerstone for later Reformed doctrines of **inerrancy** and the **self-attestation** of Scripture, often appealed to by theologians like **Warfield** and **Van Til**.

Second, in the locus of **God, providence, and predestination**, the confessional baseline in documents like the **Westminster Confession** is a doctrine of the simple, immutable, triune God who decrees all things according to the counsel of his will, while not being the author of sin and while establishing a decree of election and reprobation in Christ. Turretin expounds this baseline with a detailed defense of classical **theism** and **compatibilism**, especially in his questions on the **will of God**, **providence**, and **predestination** in the **Institutio**. Against **Socinians** and some **Remonstrants**, he insists on divine simplicity, immutability, and exhaustive foreordination, and he rejects all forms of contingency in God or change in the divine knowledge. Against **Pelagian** and **semi-Pelagian** accounts of human freedom, he defends the view that fallen man has a natural liberty but not a moral ability for spiritual good, so that grace is both necessary and efficacious. He adopts an **infralapsarian** ordering of the decrees, in contrast to some supralapsarian contemporaries, arguing that God decrees to permit the fall prior in logical order to the decree to elect some from the mass of fallen humanity. His interlocutors here include the **Remonstrants**, the **Saumur** theologians like **Amyraut**, and more philosophical adversaries influenced by **Molina**, all of whom he charges with compromising the sovereignty and simplicity of God.

Third, in the locus of **Christ, atonement, and justification**, the confessional baseline is that the incarnate **Christ** is one person in two natures, fully God and fully man, who accomplished a once-for-all **penal substitutionary** atonement for the elect and that believers receive this benefit by **faith alone** which rests on the imputed righteousness of Christ. Turretin, again in the **Institutio**, defends the **Chalcedonian** and **Athanasius** line on the person of Christ and especially hammers out the details of the **satisfaction** he offers. Against **Socinus** and later moral influence accounts, he insists that Christ bears the **penal** curse of the law in the place of his people, satisfying the vindicatory justice of God, so that the atonement is both objective and necessary given the divine nature. In justification, he carefully distinguishes the **imputed righteousness** of Christ, received by faith alone, from any inherent righteousness or infused grace, thereby refuting the **Roman Catholic** Tridentine position and also early **Neonomian** tendencies. Turretin is particularly clear that faith justifies not as a work or as a new law but solely as the instrument that unites to Christ, so his opponents here include **Bellarmine**, the **Socinians**, and some Lutheran interpreters who mischaracterize the Reformed doctrine.

Fourth, in the locus of **covenant, church, and sacraments**, the Reformed baseline is a unified covenant of grace administered differently under old and new economies and a visible church that is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, where the **word and sacraments** are the appointed means of grace. Turretin integrates **covenant theology** throughout the **Institutio**, describing the **covenant of works** made with Adam as federal head and the **covenant of grace** with Christ as second Adam, thereby grounding imputation and federal representation. He rejects **Amyraldian** hypotheses that posit a universal hypothetical covenant that softens particular atonement and unconditional election. In ecclesiology he defends the Reformed marks of the **church** as the pure preaching of the word, right administration of the **sacraments**, and church discipline, and he critiques both **Roman** claims of papal primacy and **Anabaptist** separatism. His sacramental theology is robustly **Calvinian**: he affirms a real spiritual presence of Christ in the Supper, received by faith through the Spirit, while rejecting both **transubstantiation** and bare memorialism, and he vigorously defends **infant baptism** on covenantal grounds against **Anabaptists**. In all this, his interlocutors include Roman theologians like **Bellarmine**, Lutherans on sacramental presence, and various **radical** groups on church and sacrament.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Within the broader trajectory of **Reformed orthodoxy**, Turretin stands as a paradigmatic figure who both consolidates and refines earlier work and whose influence extends deeply into later Reformed dogmatics. He is in clear continuity with **Calvin** in substance, affirming the same doctrines of **Trinity**, **justification**, and **predestination**, yet his **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** displays a much more elaborated scholastic structure than the **Institutes of the Christian Religion**. Later theologians such as **Charles Hodge** at Princeton adopt Turretin as a primary text, and Hodge's **Systematic Theology** reproduces many of Turretin's arguments on **Scripture**, **atonement**, and **predestination**. **Bavinck** speaks appreciatively of Reformed scholastics like Turretin, arguing in his **Reformed Dogmatics** that their work represents a mature stage of Reformation theology rather than a declension into rationalism. At Westminster, **Van Til** draws heavily on Turretin's view of **Scripture** as self-attesting and his distinction between ministerial and magisterial reason, while also placing Turretin's natural theology within a more explicit **presuppositional** framework.

There are, however, concrete points where a Westminster examiner will register objections or at least critical qualifications. First, some strands of the twentieth-century critique, influenced by **Barth** and **Berkouwer**, accused Turretin of a subtle **rationalism** and of treating theology too much as a deductive science. A Westminster candidate must show that although Turretin uses a highly rational **scholastic** apparatus, he does not ground revelation in autonomous reason, and his strong doctrine of **Scripture** and the Spirit's testimony guards against rationalism. Yet one may still question whether some of his **natural theology** formulations require more explicit subordination to the antithesis between belief and unbelief that **Van Til** stresses. Second, there is debate over his detailed discussions of topics such as the **covenant of works** and the speculative ordering of the **decrees**, where some may see an overuse of logical construction, though Westminster orthodoxy still generally affirms his basic positions. At the same time, Reformed theologians can learn much from Turretin: his careful discrimination of terms, his refusal of false dilemmas in debates on **free will** and **providence**, and his comprehensive engagement with opponents model a disciplined, confessional, and polemically alert dogmatics that is badly needed in our own time.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, one safe opening sentence is to call **Turretin** the high-water mark of **Reformed scholastic orthodoxy** whose **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** became the standard dogmatics at Geneva and Princeton. It is also safe to say that he is a rigorous defender of **Sola Scriptura**, of a classical doctrine of **God**, and of the Reformed doctrines of **grace and predestination** against both Rome and early modern rationalism. These lines immediately place him as an ally of the **Westminster Standards** and signal that you understand his role in the tradition. You can also safely affirm that later Reformed theologians like **Hodge** and **Bavinck** draw on Turretin, and that Westminster's own **Van Til** appreciates his doctrine of **Scripture** while intensifying his critique of autonomous reason.

There are phrases you must avoid or carefully qualify. You should not describe Turretin as a **rationalist** or say that his theology is **Cartesian**, since he explicitly opposes **Cartesianism** at Geneva and subordinates reason to **revelation**. If you mention **natural theology**, you must immediately add that for Turretin it is subordinate, incomplete, and never saving, and that he rejects any **autonomous** philosophical ground for theology. You should avoid saying that he teaches an *analogia entis* in the Roman Catholic sense, since he does affirm an analogy between God and creatures yet refuses any participation metaphysic that threatens divine **aseity** and **incomprehensibility**. Be cautious when discussing his use of **scholastic method**: examiners may press to see whether you can distinguish method from principle, so you must say that he uses a scholastic method in service of Reformation **principia** rather than supplanting biblical exegesis.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the idea that the Reformed tradition declined after **Calvin** into arid **scholasticism**, with Turretin as exhibit A. You must be ready to counter this **Calvin-versus-the-Calvinists** narrative by pointing to **Bavinck's** positive assessment and by demonstrating how Turretin combines doctrinal precision with pastoral concern in his discussions of **faith**, **assurance**, and the **Christian life**. Another misunderstanding is that his doctrine of **inerrancy** is a late nineteenth-century imposition read back into him, so it is helpful to show how he clearly affirms the full truthfulness of Scripture in the **Institutio**, anticipating positions later defended by **Warfield**. Students also sometimes assume that because Turretin engages deeply in philosophical argument, his theology is less biblical than **Calvin's**; an examiner may ask you to respond, so be ready to say that Turretin saturates his *quaestiones* with scriptural exegesis and that his scholastic distinctions serve to guard the **biblical** doctrines rather than to replace them. Finally, some confuse him with his son **Jean-Alphonse Turretin**, who did move in a more **Enlightenment** and mediating direction; clarifying this historical distinction will show that you understand the trajectory of Genevan theology across the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Turretin should be received as a central ally whose **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** offers one of the clearest and most comprehensive expressions of **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**, especially on **Scripture**, **God**, **Christ**, **predestination**, **atonement**, and **justification**, and whose ministerial use of **reason** exemplifies a disciplined scholastic method under the authority of divine revelation; we must affirm his strong doctrines of inspiration and inerrancy, his defense of penal substitution and justification by faith alone, and his robust view of divine sovereignty over all things, while denying any reading that makes his **natural theology** or his speculative ordering of the decrees into autonomous or independently normative sources of truth, and if pressed to land the plane we should say that we stand with Turretin in his basic system and spirit, while appropriating his strengths within a consciously **presuppositional** and redemptive-historical framework that further safeguards the antithesis between belief and unbelief and emphasizes Scripture's self-authenticating authority.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Francis Turretin** is the high-water mark of **Post-Reformation Reformed scholasticism**, whose **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** codifies and defends confessional orthodoxy against both Rome and emerging rationalism.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1623 in **Geneva** to an Italian Reformed family from **Lucca**, Turretin studied in **Leiden** and **Paris** and taught theology in Geneva until his death in 1687.
- His major work, the **Institutio Theologiae Elencticae** (1679–1685), is a three-volume scholastic dogmatics organized by **quaestiones** and elenctic refutations.
- The **Institutio** became a standard textbook at the **Geneva Academy** and later at **Princeton**, shaping theologians like **Charles Hodge**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Turretin grounds all theology in **revelation** and **Sola Scriptura**, insisting that Scripture alone is the inspired and inerrant principium of theology.
- He employs a rigorous **scholastic method**, using **reason** as a ministerial instrument to clarify and defend doctrines, yet denying any magisterial authority to autonomous reason.
- He affirms a subordinate **natural theology** that knows God as creator, but subjects it to **theologia revelata** and rejects any *analogia entis* in the Roman Catholic sense.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **Scripture**, Turretin defends verbal **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and the **self-authenticating** authority of the canon against **Roman Catholic** and **Socinian** challenges.
- On **God and providence**, he upholds divine **simplicity**, **immutability**, and exhaustive **foreordination**, articulating a compatibilist view of human freedom against **Remonstrants**.
- On **predestination and grace**, he adopts an **infralapsarian** ordering of the decrees and defends unconditional election and irresistible grace over against **Amyraldian** hypotheses.
- On **atonement and justification**, he argues for **penal substitutionary** satisfaction and the **imputed righteousness** of Christ received by faith alone, against **Tridentine** and **Socinian** errors.
- On **covenant and sacraments**, he affirms a **covenant of works** and a **covenant of grace**, defends **infant baptism**, and maintains a Calvinian **spiritual presence** in the Lord's Supper.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Examiners may press whether Turretin's **scholastic method** risks rationalism, so you must show how he subordinates reason to **Scripture** and the Spirit's testimony.
- His use of **natural theology** can be a tension point, requiring clarification that it is subordinate and non-salvific in light of a **Van Tilian** antithesis.
- Questions may arise about his speculative treatments of the **decrees** and the **covenant of works**, where some see over-systematization yet Westminster orthodoxy largely agrees.
- The narrative of decline from **Calvin** to the scholastics is a landmine, so you must rebut it by appealing to **Bavinck's** positive evaluation of Turretin and Reformed scholasticism.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Calvin vs Turretin** on method highlights biblical-humanist exposition versus mature **scholastic systematization** within one Reformed tradition.
- **Turretin vs Barth** on **Scripture and revelation** contrasts inerrantist *theopneustos* Scripture with **Barth's** more dynamic, Christ-event-centered view.
- **Turretin vs Arminius/Remonstrants** on **predestination and free will** clarifies compatibilist sovereignty against conditional election and libertarian freedom.
- **Turretin vs Roman Catholic Bellarmine** on **Scripture and justification** illustrates Sola Scriptura and imputed righteousness over against **tradition** and infused grace.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Francis **Turretin** should be embraced as a decisive architect and defender of confessional **Reformed orthodoxy**, whose precise scholastic theology of **Scripture**, **God**, and **grace** remains a normative ally when critically received through a consciously presuppositional lens.
