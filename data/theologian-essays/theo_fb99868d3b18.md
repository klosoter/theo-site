### ESSAY
Molly Worthen has established herself as a leading interpreter of the **crisis of authority** within modern American **evangelicalism**, offering a historically grounded, conceptually lucid account of how believers negotiate the tension between **biblicism**, **religious experience**, and the demands of **modern knowledge**. Working within a **contemporary historical-critical tradition**, she seeks to describe rather than prescribe, yet her descriptions carry unmistakable theological implications for doctrines of **revelation**, **Scripture**, **pneumatology**, and **ecclesial authority**. Located intellectually alongside **Mark Noll**, **George Marsden**, and **Nathan Hatch**, and methodologically conversant with **Clifford Geertz** and **Talal Asad**, Worthen reads evangelical thought as a suite of practices by which communities claim, routinize, and contest **epistemic authority** in late modernity. Her analysis ranges from the postwar reconfiguration of **neo-evangelicalism** to the global rise of **Pentecostal-charismatic** networks, with **Apostles of Reason** (2013) serving as the focal monograph.

Worthen’s method is **historical-critical** in a strong sense: she privileges archives, institutional histories, and lived practices, while deploying a conceptual grammar drawn from **anthropology of religion** and **intellectual history**. The result is a layered narrative that links overt doctrinal claims about **inerrancy** or **apologetics** to tacit regimes of **power-knowledge** reminiscent of **Michel Foucault**, while still honoring the insider logic of evangelical **conversion**, **discipleship**, and **mission**. She uses **Geertzian thick description** to render the local texture of prayer meetings, campus ministries, and faculty debates, yet frames these vignettes within broader processes of **Weberian routinization of charisma** and late modern contestation of **rational authority**. The recurring motif is a triangulation of **Scripture**, **reason**, and **experience** under the pressure of university disciplines, democratic populism, and marketized **parachurch** innovation. In this sense, the crisis of authority is not a failure only, but a productive instability that generates evangelical creativity and fragmentation.

Her first book, **The Man on Whom Nothing Was Lost** (2006), profiles the diplomat and teacher **Charles Hill**, introducing themes that become theological by implication: the formation of intellectual authority, the performance of expertise, and the apprenticeship of judgment. Though not a study of doctrine, the book rehearses the questions that animate **Apostles of Reason**: who authorizes knowledge, how do institutions train interpreters, and what habits of mind allow one to command assent. By tracing Hill’s **grand strategy** across statecraft and pedagogy, Worthen practices a kind of **microhistory of authority** that will later be transposed to the evangelical sphere, where catechesis, **apologetics**, and institutional branding operate as parallel arts of persuasion.

In **Apostles of Reason** (2013) Worthen offers a synoptic narrative of **American evangelicalism** from the mid-twentieth century to the early twenty-first, organized around recurrent attempts to stabilize **normative authority**. She begins with the **neo-evangelical** project associated with **Harold Ockenga**, **Carl F. H. Henry**, and **Billy Graham**: a bid to transcend separatist **fundamentalism** by reengaging **modern scholarship** and public culture while safeguarding doctrinal boundaries through **inerrancy** and confessional minimalism. The founding of **Fuller Theological Seminary**, the influence of **Christianity Today**, and the consolidation of the **National Association of Evangelicals** are read as institutional experiments in balancing intellectual ambition with popular mobilization. Worthen argues that this balancing act institutionalized a paradox: evangelical leaders framed **biblicism** as both the democratizing key to faith and the technocratic warrant for elite leadership, a paradox that made **crisis of authority** constitutive rather than accidental.

The book’s middle chapters probe evangelical knowledge practices with special attention to **apologetics** and **hermeneutics**, contrasting **presuppositionalism** associated with **Cornelius Van Til** to **evidentialism** represented by figures like **John Warwick Montgomery** and popularizers such as **Josh McDowell**. For Worthen, the clash between **presuppositionalism** and **evidentialism** is more than a tactic in debates with secularism; it is a struggle over who may authorize rationality itself and how **Scripture** relates to modern canons of evidence. The rise of the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978 is treated not as the resolution of hermeneutical dilemmas but as the bureaucratization of judgment, designed to police theological faculties and publishers in a growing **evangelical marketplace**. Controversies at **Fuller** regarding **psychology and integration**, the **Evangelical Theological Society** disputes over **open theism**, and battles about **creation science** and **evolution** exemplify, in Worthen’s telling, the failure of any single technique of legitimation to govern a mass movement that prizes both **common-sense realism** and expert gatekeepers.

Worthen also attends to transatlantic and transdenominational influences, particularly the role of **John Stott**, **C. S. Lewis**, and **Francis Schaeffer** in shaping evangelical imagination about **reason** and **culture**. **Schaeffer** receives extended treatment as a purveyor of a totalizing **worldview** apologetic that promised unification of facts and values, providing anxious students with a narrativized **metaphysics** that could answer the university as such. Yet Worthen underscores how **L'Abri**'s appeal also exemplified the conjoined desire for **intellectual seriousness** and existential **experience**, a desire that often displaced ecclesial catechesis with itinerant authority figures and media. The tension between **parachurch** creativity and **churchly** form remains a leitmotif in her explanation of evangelical fragmentation.

A distinctive contribution of Worthen’s work is her sustained interest in **Pentecostal-charismatic** movements and their logics of **charismatic authority**. She shows how practices of **prophecy**, **healing**, and **spiritual warfare** generate immediate claims on the conscience that do not neatly submit to the textualist guarantees of **inerrancy**, thereby multiplying sites of **authority** beyond seminaries and editorial boards. In attending to the **Third Wave** and global charismatic currents, Worthen implies that the crisis of authority is not overcome when textual confidence is maximized; rather, it is reconfigured as the contest between the **Spirit’s immediacy** and the text’s institutionalized interpreters. Her public essays and reportage since 2013 have explored how **charismatic Christianity** intertwines with transnational networks, deliverance ministries, and political imaginaries, suggesting that the evangelical field is now structured as much by **pneumatological claims** as by the hermeneutics of **biblicism**.

Political theology functions in Worthen’s narrative less as a doctrinal locus than as an index of authority strategies deployed in public. The rise of the **Christian Right**, the language of **family values**, and recurrent appeals to **religious liberty** appear as applications of evangelical authority claims in the civic sphere, often mediated by **parachurch** mobilization rather than ecclesial deliberation. Worthen highlights the gendered dynamics of authority, noting how figures like **James Dobson** sacralized domestic expertise, and she traces how media ecosystems cultivated a style of **populist epistemology** that blurred the line between **testimony** and **evidence**. Her op-eds and essays link evangelical knowledge practices to broader currents of **post-truth** politics, not by imputing bad faith but by showing how cherished tactics of **apologetics** and **personal witness** can underwrite a political rhetoric skeptical of professional expertise and hospitable to counter-elites.

Theologically, Worthen’s story presses on classic loci of **revelation** and **Scripture** by showing that evangelical appeals to **inerrancy** often function as institutional hedges rather than hermeneutical solutions. She interprets **biblicism** as a family of strategies ranging from **common-sense literalism** to sophisticated canonical reasoning, all animated by the promise of immediate access to divine will without thick **tradition**. Yet in case after case, the absence of a stable **ecclesiology** yields to **parachurch** arbitration of disputes, so that authority collapses into the negotiating power of donors, publishers, and celebrity pastors. At the same time, her treatment of **charismata** exposes a parallel pattern in which the claim of **Spirit-borne immediacy** produces its own institutionalizations through apostolic networks, deliverance protocols, and media ministries. The result is a double bind: evangelicals suspect both **tradition** and secular expertise, thereby oscillating between **textual closure** and **pneumatic openness** without an agreed rule for adjudication.

Worthen’s interlocutors in the academy are the historians of evangelicalism who supplied the key frames she reworks. With **David Bebbington** she acknowledges the enduring template of **conversionism**, **biblicism**, **crucicentrism**, and **activism**, yet she contends that the salient analytical problem is not identity markers but the unsettled grounds of **authority** that those markers presuppose. With **Noll** she shares an interest in the **evangelical mind**, but she pivots from cataloging intellectual achievements and failures to mapping the institutional technologies of legitimation such as **inerrancy statements**, accrediting bodies, and **parachurch** governance. With **Marsden** and **Hatch** she traces the democratizing impulse that enabled evangelical growth, though she stresses how democratization opens space for rival **authorities** to proliferate. Critics from within evangelicalism have pressed Worthen on questions of reductionism, arguing that she reads theological claims too strictly as sociological strategies, but even her critics concede the accuracy of her institutional cartography and the value of her attention to **charismatic** dynamics irreducible to text-centered programs.

In sum, Worthen contributes a high-resolution **historical-critical** anatomy of evangelical authority that moves beyond moralizing narratives of success or failure. She shows how claims about **Scripture**, **reason**, and **experience** function within complex ecologies of **institutions**, **media**, and **markets**, while refusing to detach doctrinal debates from their settings in **universities**, **seminaries**, and **parachurch** organizations. Her portrait is therefore neither triumphalist nor despairing. It is genealogical in the service of understanding how a tradition that prizes **biblicism** and **conversion** survives and innovates under late-modern conditions of contested **rationality**. By extending her analysis to **charismatic Christianity**, she complicates any simplistic binary between text and tradition, showing that the **Spirit** can be as institutionalized as the **letter**.

From a Reformed and WTS vantage, Worthen’s mapping of **neo-evangelicalism** is clarifying but also invites principled dissent. Positively, her exposure of the evangelical reliance on **parachurch** surrogates for **ecclesial authority**, her attention to the bureaucratization of **inerrancy**, and her account of the uneasy coexistence of **presuppositionalism** and **evidentialism** corroborate Reformed warnings against **voluntarism** and theological minimalism. She helpfully distinguishes **biblicism** as a method that sidelines **traditio** from a classical **doctrine of Scripture** that locates interpretation within the church under the **Spiritus Sanctus**. Yet her interpretive habit of reading doctrinal claims chiefly as outcomes of power-struggle risks a **sociological reductionism** that occludes the principia of **Reformed prolegomena**: the principium cognoscendi externum of **Scriptura** and the principium cognoscendi internum of **Spiritus**, ordered by a confessed **analogia fidei** within a visible **church**. A Reformed corrective would relocate authority from entrepreneurial **parachurch** networks to ordained office and **ordinary means of grace**, clarify **inerrancy** within a broader doctrine of **divine accommodation** and **covenant**, and temper culture-war **activism** through a reassertion of two-kingdom or sphere-sovereignty prudence. Where Worthen narrates enduring crisis, classical Reformed ecclesiology holds out a differentiated settlement of **revelation**, **nature**, and **history** that secures confidence in **Scripture** without collapsing into **biblicism**, and welcomes the **Spirit’s** gifts without surrendering the church’s confessional rule.
