### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to figuration
Richard B. Hays emerged in the late twentieth century as a leading voice in **evangelical biblical theology** precisely at the point where **historical-critical exegesis** and **ecclesial interpretation** met and often collided. Trained at **Yale** and teaching at **Yale Divinity School** before his long tenure at **Duke Divinity School**, where he served as **Dean** from 2010 to 2015, Hays developed under the influence of **Hans Frei** and **George Lindbeck** a deep sympathy for **postliberal narrative theology**, while from **Brevard Childs** he learned the constructive potential of **canonical interpretation**. He remained a United Methodist churchman, committed to the church’s proclamation of **the resurrection of Jesus** as the hermeneutical key to Israel’s Scriptures. That combination of **ecclesial accountability**, **canonical sensibility**, and **historical acuity** set the stage for his signature contribution: a disciplined **figural reading** of Scripture that uncovers **intertextual echoes** as the texture of New Testament theology.

Hays’ intellectual milieu was decisively shaped by the restless aftermath of **E. P. Sanders’** 1977 **Paul and Palestinian Judaism**, the rise of the **New Perspective on Paul**, and the retrieval of **patristic exegesis** through figures like **Erich Auerbach** whose account of **figuration** in Mimesis offered a literary model for biblical rereading. In this moment, Hays refused both a flat historicism that severed **Old Testament** from **New** and a free-floating allegory that ignored the concrete determinacy of **Septuagintal diction**, **Second Temple** discourses, and **apostolic witness**. He proposed instead a practice of **figural exegesis** embedded in the **Rule of Faith**, guided by the risen **Kyrios**, and cryptically made visible through the New Testament’s densely woven **echoes** of Israel’s Scripture.

#### 2. Method: canon, echo, and ecclesial discernment
At the heart of Hays’ method stands a twofold commitment to **canonical coherence** and **intertextual discernment**. By **canonical coherence**, Hays signals his conviction that the **church’s canon** is a providentially ordered field in which the **divine author** speaks a unified word oriented to **Jesus the Messiah**. That canonical stance is not an abstraction but a practice of reading with the **creedal Rule of Faith**, hearing Israel’s Scripture and the apostolic narrative as one drama resolved in the **death and resurrection** of the Lord. By **intertextual discernment**, Hays commends attention to **allusion**, **quotation**, and especially **metalepsis**, where an echo of an earlier text evokes its larger narrative horizon. His widely cited criteria for detecting **echoes** include **availability**, **volume**, **recurrence**, **thematic coherence**, **historical plausibility**, **history of interpretation**, and **satisfaction**, which together guard against eisegesis and sustain a responsible **figural hermeneutic**.

Crucially, Hays refuses the false dichotomy between **historical-critical analysis** and **theological interpretation**. He insists that careful attention to **Greek diction**, **Septuagintal resonance**, and **Second Temple idiom** strengthens rather than weakens **theological exegesis**. Yet he is equally clear that the full meaning of Scripture arises in the church’s **Spirit-led performance**, what he calls a **practical hermeneutic** grounded in **discipleship** and ordered toward **new creation**. This is why Hays calls for an **ecclesial habitus** of reading where communities are schooled by the **cross** and live into Scripture’s **participatory ontology** by conformity to Christ, rather than reducing the Bible to a quarry for **proof texts** or to an artifact of ancient religion.

#### 3. The Faith of Jesus Christ: pistis Christou and Pauline soteriology
Hays’ first major monograph, **The Faith of Jesus Christ** 1983, revised 2002, placed him at the center of the **pistis Christou** debate. Against the long-standing translation of Paul’s genitive construction as **faith in Christ**, Hays argued that the primary sense is **the faithfulness of Jesus Christ**, that is, the obedient fidelity of the Son to the Father’s saving mission. In texts like **Galatians 2.16** and **Romans 3.22**, Hays contends that Paul locates the ground of **justification** not in human believing but in the **Messiah’s obedience unto death**, which believers then participate in through being **in Christ**. This is not a denial of **justification by faith**, but a reconfiguration: human **pistis** is the act of **participatory trust** that aligns us with the saving **pistis** of the Messiah.

The theological implications are significant. Hays thereby integrates **soteriology** and **Christology**, relocating the center of gravity from an anthropological focus on faith as instrument to a **Christocentric** focus on the **obedience of the Son**. He engages **E. P. Sanders** on covenantal nomism, **J. D. G. Dunn** and **N. T. Wright** on the **New Perspective**, and counters **Stephen Westerholm** and **Douglas Moo** who defend the objective genitive. In later years, debates with **Teresa Morgan** on the semantic range of **pistis** sharpened the account of faith as relational fidelity. What endures is Hays’ insistence that Paul’s **apocalyptic** gospel announces that through the **faithful Israelite** Jesus, God has acted to usher in **new creation**, into which believers are incorporated by the **Spirit**.

#### 4. Echoes of Scripture in Paul: figural hermeneutics and ecclesial identity
In **Echoes of Scripture in the Letters of Paul** 1989, Hays pressed further into the apostolic practice of **figural exegesis**. Here he contends that Paul’s letters are saturated with **allusive engagement** of Israel’s Scripture, particularly **Isaiah**, **Psalms**, and **Deuteronomy**, and that these echoes summon the reader to retrieve the **metaleptic** horizons of those texts. The effect is to see Paul as a **scriptural theologian** whose gospel is unintelligible apart from the dense web of **intertextuality**. For example, Paul’s phrase **new creation** evokes **Isaiah’s eschatology**, while his **Christ hymn** in **Philippians 2** echoes **Isaiah 45** to identify Jesus with the **Kyrios** of Israel’s confession.

This figural vision also shapes **ecclesiology**. Hays reads Paul as narrating the **church** as the renewed **people of God**, grafted into Israel’s story, living out the **age to come** amid the powers of the present age. The **community** is therefore both the site and the subject of scriptural performance, called to embody the **cross-shaped** pattern of the Messiah. Hays’ criteria for **echo detection** gave the guild a controlled vocabulary for discussing **allusion**, and his proposal significantly advanced the **theological interpretation of Scripture** movement by demonstrating that careful literary judgment can disclose deep **Christological** claims.

#### 5. The Moral Vision of the New Testament: community, cross, new creation
With **The Moral Vision of the New Testament** 1996, Hays offered a comprehensive proposal for **New Testament ethics** whose influence has been immense in evangelical and mainline seminaries. He argues for a triadic pattern in which **community** defines the social location of moral discernment, the **cross** provides the normative pattern of self-giving love, and **new creation** supplies the eschatological horizon and telos of Christian life. Instead of abstract principles or atomistic rules, Hays commends **narrative-based practical reasoning** learned by saturating the church in Scripture and discerning how the **story of Jesus** reconfigures agency, virtue, and practice.

The book’s case studies illustrate a hermeneutic of **canonically informed discernment**. On matters such as **violence**, **divorce**, and **sexual morality**, Hays reads across the **Gospels**, **Pauline letters**, and **Catholic Epistles**, testing proposals by their fit with the **community-cross-new creation** pattern. His account differs from culture-war polemics and from modern relativisms by rooting judgments in **Christological ethics**. The influence of **Stanley Hauerwas** is palpable in the emphasis on the **church as polis**, yet Hays uniquely grounds that ecclesial ethic in the **intertextual poetics** of Scripture, showcasing how ethical insight flows from **figural reading** disciplined by the **Rule of Faith**.

#### 6. From essays to commentary: conversion of imagination and 1 Corinthians
The essay collection **The Conversion of the Imagination** 2005 displays Hays’ sustained effort to retrain Christian perception through **figural exegesis**. The phrase conversion of the imagination signals his conviction that Scripture reshapes how the church sees reality, moving readers from **old age** to **new age** vision. This work sits alongside his **First Corinthians** volume in the **Interpretation** series 1997, where he reads Pauline **community formation** through the cross, unmasking factionalism by appeal to the **foolishness of God** and treating issues like **idolatry**, **sexual ethics**, and **resurrection** through pervasive **Old Testament** resonances. Hays here models a pastoral exegesis that is simultaneously **philological**, **canonical**, and **ecclesial**.

During this period Hays also co-edited **The Art of Reading Scripture** 2003 with **Ellen F. Davis**, a programmatic statement for the burgeoning field of **theological interpretation of Scripture**. The volume joins biblical scholars and theologians in commending **figural reading** under the church’s **creed**, insisting that Christian exegesis be **Christocentric**, **canonical**, and ordered to **sanctification**. Hays’ essays within the volume extend his claim that the apostolic authors already read Scripture **backwards** from the **resurrection**, thereby authorizing the church to pursue a disciplined **sensus plenior** that hears more in Israel’s Scripture than its first hearers could have grasped, without abandoning **historical reality**.

#### 7. Reading Backwards and the Gospels: high Christology through scriptural echoes
Hays’ late work on the **Gospels** brought his figural method to a mature articulation. In **Reading Backwards** 2014 and **Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels** 2016, he argues that the evangelists portray Jesus by **reverberating** Israel’s Scripture, thereby identifying him as the **embodiment of Israel’s God**. **Mark** is read as a narrative of **Isaianic new exodus**, where Jesus does the works of **YHWH** and where cryptic **allusions** disclose a **mystery Christology**. **Matthew** arranges **Emmanuel** motifs to present Jesus as **God with us**, not merely as a Davidic messiah but as the divine presence who fulfills **Torah and Prophets**. **Luke** frames Jesus’ mission through **Isaiah 61**, the **Jubilee** proclamation, and the **Temple** theme, suggesting an inaugurated eschatology in which Israel’s hope is being realized. **John** deploys **I am** sayings and **Temple** imagery to declare that in Jesus the **Glory** has tabernacled among us, the Word who was **with God** and **was God**.

The underlying thesis is that a properly **figural exegesis** unveils a deep **high Christology** already embedded in the narrative warp and weft of the Gospels. This is not retrojection but the evangelists’ **retrospective discernment** in light of the **resurrection**. Hays’ handling of **metalepsis** is crucial here, as he shows how a brief phrase can summon a whole **Old Testament** scene that reframes a Gospel episode. The result is a compelling case that **Christological identity** in the New Testament is rendered through **scriptural poetics** as much as through explicit metaphysical propositions. Hays’ approach thus complements the work of **Richard Bauckham** on **divine identity**, while offering different evidentiary pathways through narrative **echoes** and liturgical resonance.

#### 8. Scripture, church, and the practice of reading
For Hays, interpretive method always serves **ecclesial formation**. He insists that Scripture must be read in and for the **church**, governed by the **Rule of Faith**, enacted in **worship**, and performed in **obedience**. He resists the language of **inerrancy** as insufficiently attuned to the canonical form and literary diversity of Scripture, yet he staunchly upholds the **authority of Scripture** and the necessity of **canonically disciplined** reading. His debt to **Erich Auerbach’s** account of **figuration** supports a vision in which earlier events and texts are fulfilled in later ones without erasing the literal sense. The church thus learns to inhabit a **typological imagination** in which **Abraham**, **Exodus**, **David**, and **Isaiah** become living coordinates of **Christian identity** in Christ.

This is why Hays repeatedly contrasts **proof-texting** with **holistic canonical discernment**. Ethical and doctrinal conclusions are to be tested by the **coherence** of readings across the canon and by their conformity to the **pattern of the cross**. He lifts up the **Spirit’s** role in animating the community’s imagination, yet he anchors discernment in publicly available **textual phenomena** like **lexical echo**, **structural parallel**, and **narrative typology**. In this way, his work helps stabilize the field of **theological interpretation**, steering it away from subjectivism toward a disciplined attentiveness to **Scripture’s own intertextual speech**.

#### 9. Suffering, eschatology, and late style
Hays’ later years were marked by personal suffering, including a diagnosis of **cancer** reported in 2015 that affected his voice and eventually led to retirement from the **Duke** deanship. This season appears to have intensified his focus on **resurrection hope** and **eschatological patience**, themes already prominent in his **Pauline** and **Gospel** studies. In **Echoes of Scripture in the Gospels**, the insistence that the evangelists teach us to read **backwards** is also an invitation to live **forward** toward the **new creation**, bearing the cross amid the ambiguities of time. He remained attentive to the question of **Israel** and **supersessionism**, urging readings that honor the integrity of **Israel’s Scripture** and the enduring election of the **Jewish people**, even as the church confesses Jesus as the **fulfillment** of the promises.

Throughout, Hays modeled a humble scholarly posture that listens to the **fathers and mothers** of the church, learns from contemporary guild standards of **philology**, and yet speaks normatively to the **people of God**. His combination of rigorous **echo detection** with constructive **ecclesial ethics** forged a pathway for a generation of scholars who seek to read the Bible as **Scripture** without abandoning intellectual integrity. In this sense, his legacy is as much **pastoral** as it is academic, a bid to restore confidence in **Christocentric canonical exegesis** as the church’s native discipline.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: convergences and cautions
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Hays’ project commands deep gratitude for its **Christocentric canon**, its recovery of **typology** and **figural exegesis**, and its unwavering focus on the **cross** and **new creation** as the teleology of Scripture. His insistence that the **divine author** speaks coherently through the canon resonates with **redemptive-historical** readings indebted to **Geerhardus Vos** and **Herman Ridderbos**. His **narrative ecclesial ethics** rightly resists moralism and grounds Christian life in **union with Christ**, displaying a welcome retrieval of **virtue** and **community** as the matrix of obedience.

Yet principled tensions remain. First, the **pistis Christou** construal risks obscuring the **forensic clarity** of **justification sola fide**, where the **imputation** of Christ’s righteousness is instrumentally received by **faith** rather than primarily narrated as participation in Christ’s **faithfulness**. A Reformed corrective would integrate Hays’ participatory emphasis as the fruit of **union with Christ**, while preserving the distinct **law-gospel** grammar of justification by the **alien righteousness** of the Mediator. Second, Hays’ postliberal reticence about **inerrancy** and occasional bracketing of **historicity** can blur the **authorial intent** of the **human authors** as vehicles of the **divine author’s** speech. Reformed doctrine of Scripture urges a thicker account of **verbal plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy**, precisely to underwrite responsible **figural** readings as the intention of the one **covenantal** God speaking across time. Third, his ecclesial primacy in ethical discernment, while salutary, sometimes softens the **covenant-legal** clarity of moral norms and the crucial distinction between **law** as pedagogue and **gospel** as power. Finally, while his resistance to **supersessionism** is welcome, a Reformed **covenant theology** would press more exactingly the continuity and discontinuity between **old** and **new** covenants. The best Reformed alternative is not a rejection of Hays’ **figural poetics**, but their anchoring in a more explicit **federal** framework where **typology** is regulated by **divine authorial intent**, **grammatico-historical exegesis**, and **confessional** clarity about **justification**, **Scripture**, and the **means of grace**.
