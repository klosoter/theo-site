### ESSAY
David Powlison, 1949–2019, emerged within the post-1970 ferment of American evangelical counseling shaped by **Jay Adams** and the founding of **CCEF** near **Westminster Theological Seminary**. His enduring thesis was that **Scripture**, rightly exegeted and pastorally applied, restores the classical **cura animarum** against both the moralism of technique and the psychologism of secular therapies. The therapeutic culture following **Freud**, **Rogers**, and **Skinner** had captured the care of souls with new vocabularies of pathology, adaptation, and self-actualization. Adams’s **Competent to Counsel** in 1970 rebutted that captivity with **nouthetic counseling**. Into that contested space, Powlison’s vocation took shape: to deepen the biblical counseling project by a richer doctrine of the **heart**, a nuanced theology of **suffering and sin**, and a historically alert engagement with modern **psychotherapy**. His ministry at **CCEF**, his long editorship of the **Journal of Biblical Counseling**, and his teaching at **WTS** made him a public theologian of pastoral care who wrote with exegetical density and clinical tact.

Formationally, Powlison’s intellectual itinerary joined rigorous humanities training with theological retrieval. Educated at **Harvard** and later earning a PhD in the **history of science and medicine** at the **University of Pennsylvania** in 1996, he studied how modern **psychiatry** and **psychology** narrated human distress. That historical work undergirded his 2010 monograph **The Biblical Counseling Movement: History and Context**, where genealogy serves theological discernment. Within the **Reformed** tradition of **Van Til**, he adopted a **Scripture-as-interpretive-lens** epistemology: general revelation yields true descriptions but cannot finally explain the moral-spiritual significance of human problems apart from special revelation. He leaned on **Calvin’s** anthropology of the **cor incurvatum** and the **Westminster Confession** on the **sufficiency of Scripture**, insisting that the Bible provides categories, aims, and methods for soul care. Rather than treating Scripture as a mere repository of proof texts, he argued that Scripture functions as the architectonic framework within which all observations about people find their place. This move disciplined the use of extra-biblical research by the rule of **analogia fidei** and the recognition of sin’s **noetic effects**.

Pastorally, Powlison recast counseling as churchly ministry in continuity with the classical **cure of souls**. He preferred the communal dynamics of **body life** over professionalized, clinic-centric models, and saw counseling as an intensified form of **discipleship** under Word and prayer. His short book **The Pastor as Counselor** in 2012 urged ministers to embrace a shepherding identity rather than outsource care to experts. In the **Journal of Biblical Counseling** he curated case wisdom, demonstrated exegetical method, and trained a generation of practitioners in what he called case-wise pastoral **discernment**. The ordinary **means of grace** were central: preaching, Scripture meditation, sacrificial love, and corporate prayer become the context within which people change. He engaged *cura animarum* with theological realism: people are sufferers and sinners, the church must speak **truth in love**, and the Holy Spirit applies **Christ’s benefits** to tangled lives over time.

The historical study **The Biblical Counseling Movement: History and Context** offered his most sustained analysis of Adams and the integrative projects of **Christian psychology**. He appreciated **Jay Adams** for reasserting **biblical authority** and moral accountability but identified reductive tendencies in early **nouthetic** practice, notably an underdeveloped theology of **suffering**, emotion, and wisdom. He critically engaged integrationists such as **Larry Crabb**, **Eric Johnson**, and **Gary Collins**, arguing that their constructive use of **psychological theory** often lacked sufficient confessional control by **biblical categories** and the **teleology** of sanctification. He historicized **psychoanalysis**, **behaviorism**, and **humanistic therapy**, showing how these systems embed rival anthropologies and soteriologies. For Powlison, the decisive question was not technique but **godward orientation**: what do we fear, desire, trust, and love, and how do those worship dynamics relate to the living **Triune God** who speaks in Scripture and acts in Christ.

His core constructive theme appears in **Seeing with New Eyes** in 2003 and **Speaking Truth in Love** in 2005: the **heart** is the worship center of the person, and **idolatry** re-describes disordered motivations. Drawing exegetically from **Ezekiel 14** and **James 4**, he argued that desires elevated to demands become **idols of the heart**, generating quarrels, anxiety, and despair. The pastoral task is to expose these God-substitutes with gracious specificity using what became known as **X-ray questions**, a diagnostic tool arrayed around what a person fears, needs, trusts, and treasures. This diagnosis reframes symptom language with moral-spiritual sense while honoring the complexity of lived experience. He retrieved **Augustine’s** *ordo amoris* to depict sanctification as rightly ordered loves under **the Lordship of Christ**. Unlike cognitive-behavioral interventions patterned after **Aaron Beck** or **Albert Ellis**, his counsel aimed at worship reorientation rather than mere belief or behavior modification, though he welcomed cognitive clarity and behavioral responsibility as fruits of repentance.

In place of technical models of change, Powlison popularized and refined a biblical **change process** summarized in the CCEF diagram of **heat, thorns, cross, fruit**. He employed this schema as a pastoral catechism: the **heat** of life’s circumstances activates the **thorns** of sinful responses or the **fruit** of godly responses; the **cross** represents **union with Christ** and the **grace** that renews the heart’s allegiances. In **How Does Sanctification Work?** in 2017 he expanded this dynamic into a multifaceted account: the Holy Spirit uses many instruments, including **Scripture**, **prayer**, the **church**, **providence**, and Spirit-gifted people, to produce gradual, situationally concrete change. He resisted reductionism, insisting that sanctification is both **forensic** in its ground and **transformative** in its progress, and that pastoral care should calibrate to life’s variety, honoring both **mortification** and **vivification**. The method was not a technique so much as a wise *habitus* formed by immersion in the **Bible’s storyline** and practiced within the **communion of saints**.

Powlison’s theology of the **powers** extended his pastoral realism to the contested field of **spiritual warfare**. In **Power Encounters: Reclaiming Spiritual Warfare** in 1995 he critiqued spectacular and strategic-level deliverance models popular in some evangelical circles, which treated warfare as specialized rituals or territorial contests. He retrieved the **apostolic** pattern of warfare in Ephesians 6 and James, where the struggle is waged through truth, holiness, perseverance, prayer, and mutual exhortation. This recovery returns to **ordinary means of grace** as the theater of combat against the world, the flesh, and the devil. He did not deny demonic reality or extraordinary affliction but insisted that the normative pastoral response is steady **repentance and faith**, vigilance, and the **armor of God**, thereby integrating warfare with the same **sanctification** dynamics that animate counseling.

Emotions, especially **anger**, provided a focused laboratory for his method. In **Good and Angry** in 2016 he parsed anger as a moral emotion that can be righteous, cresting in zeal for God’s name, or unrighteous, curving into self-worship and retribution. The crucial move is to identify what kingdom is at stake, whose will is being done, and what loves are at play. He connected emotional change to **Psalms**-shaped prayer, renewing desire under the **sovereignty of God**. In **God’s Grace in Your Suffering** in 2018 he elaborated a biblical theology of affliction, weaving lament, hope, and perseverance. On contested clinical questions he argued that **DSM** categories are descriptive not explanatory; bodily realities can be proximate causes that call for **medical** care, while Scripture interprets ultimate causes and redemptive aims. He advocated thoughtful collaboration under pastoral leadership, honored **common grace** insights, and urged humility under **the Lord’s providence** when parsing the entanglement of brain, body, story, and soul.

Institutionally, Powlison’s influence flowed through the **Journal of Biblical Counseling**, where he cultivated a repository of exegetical essays, case studies, and pastoral strategies that modeled canonical reasoning and sensitive application. He championed **church-based counseling**, training laypeople, elders, and pastors to speak **truth in love** as a communal calling. His editorial voice balanced polemic and pastoral care, rebutting the hegemony of **technique** without caricature, while addressing contemporary complexities such as **sexual brokenness**, **marriage and family**, **trauma**, and **habitual sins**. His leadership at **CCEF** embedded pedagogy in the life of the church, with courses like **Dynamics of Biblical Change** operationalizing his commitments to heart-focused discipleship, **union with Christ**, and the slow work of love. The trajectory across his works is consistent: to recover a robustly theological, ecclesially located, and experientially wise ministry of the **Word** for modern people.

Across his career he conversed with and sometimes contested voices in **Christian psychology**, especially **Larry Crabb** and **Eric Johnson**, while also engaging secular schools such as **cognitive-behavioral therapy** and **humanistic counseling**. His hermeneutic of extra-biblical knowledge turned on two principles: first, **observational validity** exists by **general revelation** and is often useful; second, **interpretive authority** belongs to God’s **special revelation**, which alone renders a total account of persons as worshipers designed for **communion with God**. Thus he often reframed empirically observed cycles, triggers, or schemas within **biblical categories** of fear, desire, trust, pride, love, and hope. This yielded a distinctive practical **anthropology** that addresses both **sin** as idolatry and **suffering** as lived weakness under the hand of God, placing both beneath the promises and commands of the **gospel**.

From a Reformed and WTS standpoint, Powlison’s project powerfully re-centers the **means of grace** and the **sufficiency of Scripture** for the **cure of souls**, aligning with **Westminster** on sanctification as Spirit-wrought conformity to **Christ** through Word, sacrament, and prayer. Strengths include his deep **anthropology of the heart**, his insistence that counseling be ecclesial rather than merely clinical, and his principled, non-hostile critique of modern **psychologies**. Tensions arise where the rhetoric of sufficiency risks functional **biblicism** that underutilizes **general revelation** and **common grace** in medicine and research, or where counseling practice can eclipse sacramental and liturgical means central to classic Reformed **piety**. A Reformed alternative nuance would integrate his heart-focused discipling with a thicker **ecclesiology** including the **Lord’s Supper** as a means of strengthening weak faith, a more explicit doctrine of **vocation** and **natural law** for creational patterns, and a two-kingdoms sensibility that distinguishes counseling’s pastoral aims from the legitimate, limited help of civic sciences. Within those calibrations, his work stands as a significant retrieval of **cura animarum** that calls pastors to preach, pray, and personally apply the **gospel** until people learn, in the power of the Spirit, to love God and neighbor from a renewed **heart**.
