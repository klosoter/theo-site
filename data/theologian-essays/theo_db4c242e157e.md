### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The theology of **Peter J. Leithart**, born 1959, emerges from a late modern **Reformed** environment wrestling with the fate of **Protestantism** in a fragmented West, the possibilities of **Christendom**, and the renewal of **biblical theology**. His early years of ministry and teaching matured in the ferment surrounding **Moscow, Idaho**, where classical Christian education, **New Saint Andrews College**, and post-Constantinian debates intersected with liturgical retrieval and **typological exegesis**. Ordained in the **Presbyterian Church in America** and later ministering within the **Communion of Reformed Evangelical Churches**, Leithart navigated the waters of the **Federal Vision** controversy and the 2011–2012 PCA judicial process while producing a prolific body of **biblical-theological** work. His institutional base since 2013 has been the **Theopolis Institute** in Birmingham, which coordinates research and training in **liturgy**, **sacrament**, and **scriptural interpretation**. Methodologically he positions himself between **postliberal figural reading** and a catholic ressourcement of **liturgy**, pursuing an integrative practice of **exegesis**, **ecclesiology**, and **political theology** under the confession **Jesus is Lord**.

If there is a signature to Leithart’s program, it is a disciplined **figuration** that unites textual detail with ecclesial practice and public life. Influenced by **James B. Jordan** in pattern recognition, **Alexander Schmemann** in sacramental ontology, and **Eugen Rosenstock-Huessy** in social grammar, Leithart reads the world as a network of **signs** ordered to **Trinity**, **covenant**, and **liturgy**. He insists that a Reformed **sola Scriptura** is not a narrow biblicism but a canonical **sacramental realism** in which creation itself is a theater of **divine wisdom**. This yields a hermeneutic that privileges **typology**, **intertextuality**, **numerical and architectural patterning**, and the symphonic resonance of **Temple**, **priesthood**, and **kingdom** across the canon. The result is a method where doctrinal loci are not built atop the text but grow from within **Scripture as canon**, with **ecclesial worship** and **public rites** as the natural habitat of theology.

#### 2. Hermeneutics as deep figuration
Leithart’s hermeneutics is programmatically articulated in **Deep Exegesis**, 2009, where he defends a multi-layered, **sensus plenior**-friendly reading that refuses the strictures of modern historicism while respecting historical particulars. He argues for **figuration** rather than free allegory, a mode modeled by **Matthew’s** fulfillment citations and by **Paul’s** rereading of **Exodus** and **Abraham** through **Christ**. Key tools include **intertextual echo**, **chiasm**, **micro-typology**, and the perception of **liturgical architecture** within narratives, such as the convergence of **Garden**, **Tabernacle**, and **Temple** in **Genesis–Kings**. The practice is elaborated in **A House for My Name**, 2000, a canonical survey of the Old Testament that highlights the patterns of **sabbath**, **sacrifice**, **feast**, and **priest-king** that culminate in **Christ** and shape **church polity** and **worship**.

His commentary on **1 and 2 Kings**, 2006, in the Brazos Theological Commentary series exemplifies the method. Here the regnal evaluations are read through the grammar of **Deuteronomy**, the rise and fall of the monarchy is interpreted through **Temple-building** and **sacrificial failures**, and the prophetic critiques of **Elijah** and **Elisha** are located in a theological drama of **idolatry**, **syncretism**, and **covenant succession**. Later, in **Revelation**, 2018, he intensifies the figural approach by treating **Apocalypse** as Temple-liturgical prophecy that unveils Rome and Jerusalem through a rich mosaic of **Exodus** plagues, **Psalms** liturgy, and **Danielic** visions. The guiding conviction in these works is that the canon’s **typological weave** is the primary pedagogy of God, and that doctrinal clarity is reached by tracing **figures** to their **Christic telos** in **Word** and **Sacrament**.

#### 3. Church and sacrament: an ecclesial social ontology
Leithart’s ecclesiology is boldly stated in **Against Christianity**, 2003, which provocatively rejects the category of religion in favor of the concrete **ekklesia** as an alternative **polis**. The church is not a religious subset but the constitutive **public** formed by the rites of **Baptism** and **Eucharist**, and her *lex orandi* is the constitutive **lex credendi** and **lex convivendi**. In **From Silence to Song**, 2003, he reads the Davidic reconfiguration of worship as a **liturgical revolution** that knit Israel into a singing polity, a theme that returns in later **Theopolis Institute** projects of psalmic renewal and **weekly Eucharist**. This ecclesial social ontology grounds his advocacy of **baptismal objectivity**, **paedocommunion**, and the unity of **Word and sign** as a single divine economy.

The most focused statements of sacramental theology appear in **The Baptized Body**, 2007, and in essays that accompany the **Federal Vision** debates. Baptism, for Leithart, effects visible incorporation into **Christ** and the **covenant**, rendering the baptized truly **Christian**, though unfaithfulness can sever the bond through **apostasy**. He seeks to hold forensic **justification** and ecclesial **participation** together by refusing to reduce either to merely legal or to merely ontic categories. The eucharist is the rite that feeds and forms the ecclesial body, establishing economic practices of **gratitude**, developed further in **Gratitude**, 2014, as a political economy of **gift** against the nihilism of **modern exchange**. The social consequence of this sacramental realism is a program for **catechesis**, **psalm-singing**, and **ritual order** that shape households, parishes, and civic life.

#### 4. Political theology: Constantine, empire, and Christendom
Leithart’s political theology is best known through **Defending Constantine**, 2010, a revisionist account that challenges the **Yoder-Hauerwas** narrative of Constantinian fall. He argues that **Constantine** did not paganize the church but, however imperfectly, initiated a Christian **imperium** that protected the church’s worship, restrained pagan violence, and fostered **catholic unity**. He contests the trope of coercive **Constantinianism**, insisting that critics misread late antique **church-state** cooperation and flatten the diverse modalities of **imperial power**. The book is not nostalgia but a theological case that **Christendom** is a legitimate outworking of **Christ’s kingship** mediated through baptized rulers and juridical goods.

In **Between Babel and Beast**, 2012, Leithart extends the argument into a biblical theology of empire. He reads the sequence from **Babel** to **Babylon**, culminating in **Rome**, through the prophetic grammar of **idolatry** and **blood-guilt**, and he evaluates the United States as a nation oscillating between **Babel** and **beast**. The aim is not partisan adjudication but a call to national **baptism** under the reign of **Jesus**. The church, as the first polity, calls the nations to live as second-order societies under **divine law** and **sacramental time**. The political telos of this vision is not theocracy in a crude sense but a renewed **symphonia** of church and commonwealth ordered to **justice**, **mercy**, and **worship**.

#### 5. Atonement and Paul: stoicheia and deliverance
The most ambitious dogmatic synthesis is **Delivered from the Elements of the World**, 2016, where Leithart reframes **atonement** and **justification** through a Paul-inspired anthropology of the **stoicheia tou kosmou**. Drawing from **J. Louis Martyn’s** apocalyptic reading of **Galatians**, engaging **N. T. Wright** on covenant and **René Girard** on scapegoating, he constructs a thick account of how ritual order, social identity, and elemental powers entangle humanity in cycles of **sacrifice**, **exclusion**, and **death**. The cross of **Jesus** exposes and exhausts the mechanisms of sacrificial violence, while the **resurrection-Spirit** inaugurates a new sociopolitical order embodied in the **church’s rites**. **Justification** here retains a forensic axis, the verdict of acquittal in **Christ**, yet it is simultaneously the entrance into a new **symbolic economy** whose tokens are **baptism**, **table**, and **spirit-led** life.

This project attempts a striking synthesis of covenantal **forensics**, **participatory union**, and cultural anthropology. Leithart resists both reductionist **penal substitution** and reductionist **moral influence**, arguing that the biblical grammar of **sacrifice** includes punishment, purification, gift, and communion. The innovation is the social re-description of **law**, **flesh**, and **principalities** as ritual-political matrices that only **Christ’s pascha** can disarm. Critics from classical **Reformed orthodoxy** question whether the account sufficiently clarifies the relation of substitution, imputation, and penal satisfaction, yet many find in Leithart a salutary expansion of atonement’s **biblical breadth** and an insistence that **justification by faith** yields a visible **ecclesial polis**.

#### 6. Trinity, creation, and symbolic ontology
In **Traces of the Trinity**, 2015, Leithart proposes that creation bears discerning marks of **perichoretic** life. Without claiming a **natural theology** detached from the gospel, he argues that relational patterns of **mutual indwelling**, communicative **self-giving**, and ordered **difference-in-unity** appear in language, culture, and the arts because the world is created by the **Triune**. This symbolic ontology undergirds his routine claim that things are what they are by virtue of their **liturgical** relations. The world is constructed to be read, and **Scripture** trains the church to read it in the light of **Christ**. The payoff is not speculative metaphysics but a practical discernment of **patterns** that guide pastoral work, architectural form, and civic prudence.

For Leithart, this symbolic realism is always yoked to **sacrament**. The eucharistic body is the genuine social metaphysics from which analogies are judged. That conviction restrains the slide into an **analogia entis** divorced from revelation while still giving warrant for cultural analysis under **Trinity**. The world’s intelligibility is received as **gift**, and reading its traces is an act of **gratitude**. The ecclesial consequences include a commitment to robust **catechesis**, a recovery of **holy time** through the Christian calendar, and a love of crafted **liturgy** ordered to the **Triune** presence.

#### 7. Canon, temple, and priest-king patterns
Much of Leithart’s oeuvre circles back to the temple-priest-king nexus that structures the Bible’s **macro-typology**. **A House for My Name**, 2000, and **From Silence to Song**, 2003, already announced the agenda: read **Genesis–Kings** as the rise and rupture of a royal priesthood building and defiling **God’s house**, then watch the prophets and writings promise the **Son of David** who will reestablish **sacrificial worship** as song. The **1 and 2 Kings** commentary, 2006, reads even administrative details as liturgical choreography, while **Revelation**, 2018, is for Leithart the consummate unveiling of the **new temple** that is the **church**. This temple-polity then instructs the church’s polity: pastors as **priestly rulers**, households as **micro-temples**, and cities as **gardened spaces** fit for **sabbath**.

This canonically ordered imagination fuels Leithart’s pastoral proposals through the **Theopolis Institute**. He argues for weekly **Eucharist**, psalm-heavy **office**, the musical catechesis of children, and a public architecture that enacts the grammar of **holy place** and **holy time**. In publishing, teaching intensives, and collaborative projects, he presses for a new **Protestant** habitus that is catholic in rite and confident in **Scripture’s** figural truth. The aim is not antiquarianism but the cultivation of a church capable of reading and ruling time and space under **Christ’s lordship**.

#### 8. Unity, Protestant futures, and catholicity
The ecumenical horizon of Leithart’s work crystallizes in **The End of Protestantism**, 2016. By this phrase he does not mean capitulation to **Rome** or **Orthodoxy** but the end of Protestants-as-a-denomination and the maturation of a **reformational catholicity** that seeks visible **unity** without erasing doctrinal integrity. He calls for mutual recognition of baptisms, shared **Eucharist** where possible, cooperative mission, and a rigorous charitable rereading of divisive confessional histories in light of **Scripture**. The argument is anchored in his hermeneutic confidence that the canon’s **typological unity** demands an ecclesial unity both spiritual and institutional.

This program necessarily touches contested loci such as **justification**, **ministerial succession**, and **sacramental presence**. Leithart is not naïve about intractable standoffs, yet he argues that **Protestant** confidence in **sola Scriptura** and **solus Christus** should enable rather than hinder reconciliation under shared **Trinitarian** and **Christological** dogma. The end he seeks is a post-denominational **Christendom** where the church’s unified witness reorders culture, law, and the arts around **Word** and **sacrament**. The ecclesial politics of this proposal continue to provoke sharp responses from multiple sides, a sign that its ambition touches bedrock questions of **authority**, **order**, and **truth**.

#### 9. Debates, Federal Vision, and scholarly interlocutors
No profile of Leithart can bypass the **Federal Vision** controversy that marked the first decades of this century within conservative **Reformed** churches. His advocacy of **baptismal objectivity**, **covenant membership**, and **paedocommunion** drew scrutiny from those concerned to preserve **sola fide**, the precise **ordo salutis**, and the classical distinction between *signum* and *res*. The 2011–2012 PCA judicial process concluded without censure, yet the episode clarified fault lines in **sacramental theology**, **assurance**, and **ecclesiology**. On the other side, engagement with **Yoder** and **Hauerwas** over **Constantine**, and with **Wright**, **Martyn**, and **Girard** over **Pauline apocalyptic** and **sacrifice**, located Leithart’s work within vibrant international conversations in **political theology** and **biblical studies**.

The scope of his bibliography extends beyond dogmatics and into cultural and literary studies, visible in **Gratitude**, 2014, and in essays on **Shakespeare** and **Dante**. Yet the through-line is constant: Scripture read as **figural world**, church as **public polis**, and culture as **baptizable**. Critics from within **Reformed orthodoxy** have challenged his approaches to **imputation**, **two-kingdoms** doctrine, and the risks of overly strong **sacramental efficacy**, while many sympathize with his critique of American **civil religion**, his defense of creational **goodness**, and his resolve that theology must shape **rites**, **cities**, and **habits**. The breadth of interlocutors has sharpened his method and drawn his projects into contact with the academy while remaining tethered to **pastoral ministry**.

In sum, **Peter J. Leithart** stands as a contemporary Reformed voice whose integrated program of **figural exegesis**, **liturgical ecclesiology**, and **political theology** seeks to overcome the fracture of modern **Protestantism** by returning again to **Scripture** as canon and **sacrament** as social form. His corpus is a sustained call to read deeply, worship robustly, and order public life under **Christ’s rule**.

Reformed and WTS evaluation
Leithart’s project advances a salutary recovery of **typology**, **catholic breadth**, and the church’s public calling, aligning with **covenantal** instincts to read Scripture as a unified economy of **grace**. Yet several tensions remain when measured by classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. First, his language of **baptismal objectivity** and **paedocommunion** risks collapsing the distinction of *signum* and *res* and blurring **justification by faith alone** with **ecclesial incorporation**, where a Westminster reading would safeguard **imputation**, **union with Christ**, and **assurance** through the **Spirit’s** effectual calling anchored in **decree** and **means of grace**. Second, the social-ritual construal of **atonement** and **law** in Delivered may underarticulate penal **substitution** and the covenantal **law-gospel** distinction, where a more precise **covenant of works** and **republication** grammar can clarify the justice that **Christ** satisfies and the gift that he bestows. Third, the robust defense of **Christendom** may underplay two-kingdom insights that protect the spirituality of the **church** and the integrity of **natural law**, though his critique of **civil religion** remains compelling. Finally, his **trinitarian traces** approach, while suggestive, should be subordinated to the **analogia fidei** and fenced from any drift toward an autonomous **analogia entis**. The best Reformed alternative receives his canonical, liturgical, and civic provocations, while stipulating sharper dogmatic lines at **justification**, **sacrament**, and **church-state** relations in continuity with **Westminster standards** and a Van Tillian emphasis on **revelation’s** principial authority.
