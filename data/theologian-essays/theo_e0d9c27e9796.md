### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul D. Molnar emerges within **contemporary Roman Catholic theology** as an American theologian located in the post–Vatican II era that revisited **Trinitarian doctrine**, **Christology**, and **revelation** under the pressure of modernity. Teaching systematic theology for decades at **St. John’s University, New York**, Molnar works at the intersection of **Catholic dogmatics** and **Reformed-leaning Protestant interlocutors**, especially **Karl Barth** and **Thomas F. Torrance**. He situates his approach against the dominance of **correlational theologies** that begin from **religious experience** or **historical consciousness**, arguing instead for the priority of **God’s self-revelation** in Jesus Christ through the **Holy Spirit**. This method is tethered to the classic distinction between the **immanent Trinity** and the **economic Trinity**, using Latin tags *ad intra* and *ad extra* to maintain that who God is eternally grounds what God does in salvation history. The guiding conviction is **divine freedom** and **aseity**: God is not conditioned by history or creation but freely reveals himself, thereby ensuring the **objectivity of revelation**.

Molnar’s formative context includes the **trinitarian revival** associated with **Rahner’s rule**, the claim that the **economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa**. In classic Catholic and ecumenical dogmatics, this rule functions as a hermeneutical constraint, but Molnar insists it has often been misread to imply a collapse of the **immanent Trinity into history**. Against such collapses, he reads **Barth** and **Torrance** as guardians of the primacy of **God’s act in freedom**, even as they confess the **homoousios** of the Son with the Father and the Spirit’s mission from the Father and the Son. Molnar’s method is both **exegetically responsible** and **dogmatically disciplined**: Scripture is interpreted by the church’s **creedal grammar** while the **Nicene-Constantinopolitan** and **Chalcedonian** determinations orient his constructive judgments. The core wager is that only a robust **immanent Trinity** secures the **economic Trinity** as truly revelatory rather than symbolic.

#### 2. Divine Freedom and the Trinity
The 2002 monograph **Divine Freedom and the Doctrine of the Immanent Trinity** crystallizes Molnar’s project, drawing a line between **classical theism** and modern **historicized trinitarianism**. He contends that without **divine aseity**, **simplicity**, and **immutability** properly understood, the **Trinity** is rendered contingent upon the world. Molnar retrieves **Barth’s insistence** that God is who he is in his act, yet never reduced to that act; God’s being is in act, but the act arises from a free, antecedent **immanent life**. He applies **processions and missions** to distinguish the Spirit’s eternal procession from the Spirit’s temporal sending, thus resisting readings that make the Spirit’s identity contingent on ecclesial or social dynamics. The contrast with **Catherine LaCugna**, **John Zizioulas**, and **social trinitarianism** is sharp: where they sometimes construe personhood and relationality in ways that threaten **divine unity**, Molnar stresses that the one **ousia** of God is the ground of triune communion, not a resultant of historical relations.

A recurring theme is Molnar’s qualified affirmation and correction of **Rahner’s rule**. He agrees that the **economic missions** are the self-communication of the **immanent processions**, but he denies that this entails an identity of the **immanent Trinity** with the historical economy as such. For Molnar, the rule protects the **reliability of revelation** only if guarded by **divine freedom** and **the distinction of natures** in Christ. Where **Robert Jenson** turns God’s identity into the narrative of Israel and the church, Molnar warns that **God’s eternity** risks being swallowed by history. Where **Pannenberg** makes truth eschatologically verified in universal history, Molnar replies that **resurrection** discloses the God who already and eternally is who he is. In these judgments, the key anchors are **Nicene consubstantiality**, **Chalcedonian dyophysitism**, and the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity.

#### 3. Christology: Incarnation and Resurrection
In **Incarnation and Resurrection** (2007), Molnar develops a robust **Chalcedonian Christology** with special attention to the identity between the **incarnate Son** and the **resurrected Lord**. He appropriates the **anhypostasia/enhypostasia** distinction to safeguard the truth that the humanity of Jesus has no independent hypostasis, yet is fully personalized in the **hypostasis of the Logos**. This move protects both the integrity of Christ’s humanity and the primacy of the **divine subject**, emphasizing **divine freedom** in assuming flesh. For Molnar, the **bodily resurrection** is not an addendum but the eschatological confirmation of the incarnation’s identity: the one who was crucified is the one who is raised, and only in that unity can faith know the **objectivity of salvation**.

Molnar’s Christological argument pushes against relational or symbolic reductions of **resurrection**. He criticizes approaches that treat resurrection as ecclesial memory or existential transformation, echoing **Barth’s insistence** that the **resurrection of the flesh** entails ontological novelty by **God’s sovereign act**. This has epistemological import: knowledge of God is determined by **the risen Jesus** through the **Spirit’s testimony**, not by the church’s self-expression. The point is not anti-ecclesial but pro-revelational: **Scripture**, **creed**, and **sacrament** bear witness to Christ’s act; they do not constitute it. Molnar’s dogmatics thus aligns with **classical soteriology** in which union with Christ is the Spirit’s gift, not an immanent human potential.

#### 4. Thomas F. Torrance and theological science
With **Thomas F. Torrance: Theologian of the Trinity** (2009), Molnar reads **Torrance** as a constructive ally in defending the **objectivity of revelation** and the **integrity of doctrine**. He highlights Torrance’s stress on the **homoousial mediation** of the Son and the **cognitive relation** forged by the Spirit in which our knowing is reconciled to the object to be known. Molnar approvingly expounds Torrance’s account of **scientia Dei** in which theological method is evangelical because it is ruled by the **incarnate and risen Christ** rather than by alien philosophical prolegomena. The shared polemic targets **natural theology** when construed as an autonomous pathway to God, for such a path inevitably displaces the **grace of revelation** with human conceptual schemes.

Yet Molnar is not uncritical. He marks places where **Torrance’s polemics** risk overstating discontinuity with classical **natural knowledge** of God as confessed at **Vatican I**, even as he shares Torrance’s judgement that **knowledge of the Trinity** is strictly revelational. The upshot is a careful calibration: one may acknowledge the **analogia entis** as a metaphysical grammar of participation only if decisively normed by the **analogia fidei** in which God names himself in Jesus Christ. Here Molnar positions himself as a **Catholic Barthian** who honors conciliar metaphysics while refusing any epistemic autonomy for philosophy over **dogmatic theology**.

#### 5. Spirit, faith, and freedom
In **Faith, Freedom and the Spirit** (2015), Molnar brings into view **pneumatology** as the personalizing agent of revelation without surrendering the **Christological focus**. He articulates the **mission of the Spirit** as grounding faith’s **objectivity**: the Spirit unites believers to the risen Christ, enabling a true **knowledge of God** that is doxologically participatory and ontologically real. Against **experience-first** appeals to the Spirit that bypass Christ and Scripture, Molnar argues that the Spirit’s work is to glorify the Son, teaching the church to confess the **immanent Trinity** as the living truth of the **economic missions**. This avoids both rationalism and enthusiasm by tying the **act of faith** to the **divine freedom** that calls, justifies, and sanctifies.

Molnar also probes the **Trinity’s inseparable operations** and the priority of the **one divine will**, thereby resisting tritheistic tendencies in some **social trinitarian** proposals. Faith is not a humanly generated openness to transcendence but a response determined by **grace**. He affirms the **eschatological horizon** in which the Spirit is the arrabon, the pledge of future glory, while refusing to make eschatology the determinative horizon of divine identity. This is a crucial contrast with **Pannenberg’s theology of history** and with **Jenson’s narratival ontology**, both of which Molnar regards as endangering **divine immutability** and **aseity**.

#### 6. Scripture, tradition, and dogma
Across his corpus, Molnar treats **Scripture**, **creed**, and **dogma** as the normative loci of **theological reasoning**. He appropriates **Barth’s** account of the Word of God, yet he speaks in a more Catholic register about the **regula fidei** and the **conciliar determinations** of **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon** as a hermeneutical matrix for reading the Bible. The point of this reception is to protect the **objectivity of revelation** against both **biblicism** that ignores dogmatic grammar and **historicism** that treats doctrine as flexible symbols. Molnar’s use of **anhypostasia/enhypostasia** and **processions and missions** illustrates how conciliar idiom enables precision that Scripture itself warrants in seed form.

At the level of prolegomena, he resists **natural theology** when it means an independent principium, aligning with **Barth** and **Torrance** in insisting that there is only one principium of theology: God’s **self-revelation** in Jesus Christ through the **Spirit**. Nevertheless, Molnar does not reject the **analogia entis** tout court but places it under the **analogia fidei**. In this way he defends both **divine simplicity** and **triune plurality** without collapsing either into creaturely analogies or historicized models. The result is a Catholic dogmatics that refuses to allow **philosophical autonomy** to set the agenda and instead follows the **gospel’s ontology** given with the **Trinitarian economy**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and polemics
Molnar’s constructive judgments gain clarity in contrast. He critiques **Karl Rahner** where the deployment of **transcendental method** blurs the **immanent Trinity** into conditions of human self-transcendence. He challenges **Moltmann** when eschatological suffering is projected into the **immanent life of God**, thereby jeopardizing **impassibility** as the form of divine **love**. He contests **Zizioulas** and some **social trinitarian** deployments of personhood where relations are treated as constituting the divine ousia, because the **unity of God** becomes derivative. He resists **Jenson** and **Pannenberg** when the **identity of God** is too closely tied to the historical and eschatological process, warning that this risks turning **eternity** into a predicate of time.

On the positive side, Molnar retrieves **Athanasius**, the **Cappadocians**, **Augustine**, and **Chalcedon** through the lenses of **Barth** and **Torrance**, arguing that their witness sustains the necessary grammar for modern theology. He reads **Barth’s doctrine of election** as an extension of Nicene **Christology** that upholds **divine freedom** and **grace**. He emphasizes the **inseparable operations** as the dogmatic center for resisting tritheism, while maintaining that we truly know the **immanent processions** through the **missions**. These polemics are not merely academic; they serve Molnar’s central task of defending the **objectivity of revelation** and the **reality of salvation** against conceptual domestication.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and implications
Molnar’s synthesis can be summarized by three theses. First, **divine freedom** and **aseity** are not abstract attributes but the condition for **grace**. Only if God is free *ad intra* can he be gracious *ad extra*, such that salvation is genuinely gift and not necessity. Second, the **immanent Trinity** is the foundation for the **economic Trinity**. We know the immanent life only through the economic missions, but the missions are revelatory precisely because they come from who God eternally is. Third, **Christ’s resurrection** is the epistemic and soteriological center. The **resurrected Lord** is identical to the **incarnate Son**, and the **Spirit** unites believers to him, making faith an encounter with the **truth of God** rather than a projection of communal desire. These theses bind together **Chalcedonian Christology**, **Nicene trinitarianism**, and a **revelational epistemology**.

This doctrinal center yields specific judgments. On **Christology**, Molnar insists that the person of the Son is the subject of all the human acts of Jesus, thereby safeguarding **communication of idioms** and rejecting adoptionist or kenotic reductions that would split the subject. On **soteriology**, he defends **substitutionary and participatory** dimensions within a single Christ-centered framework, following **Barth** and **Torrance** in viewing reconciliation as accomplished in Christ and applied by the **Spirit**. On **ecclesiology** and **sacrament**, he stresses that the church participates by witness and worship in what God has done, not by constituting it, thus preserving the **objectivity of grace** and avoiding ecclesiocentrism. On **eschatology**, he holds that final judgment and hope are grounded in the **risen Christ**, where **divine justice** and **mercy** coincide without requiring speculative universalism.

#### 9. Assessment of strengths and limits
A primary strength of Molnar’s work is the consistent integration of **dogmatic grammar** with a strong sense of **revelational authority**. His readings of **Barth** and **Torrance** are disciplined and sympathetic, yet aimed at service to **Catholic dogmatics**. By tethering **Rahner’s rule** to **divine freedom**, he avoids both deism and historicism, sustaining the **objectivity of revelation** in a postmodern climate skeptical of truth claims. His Christological clarity regarding **anhypostasia/enhypostasia** and the insistence on **bodily resurrection** gives his theology pastoral and doctrinal traction. Moreover, by critiquing **social trinitarianism**, he helps retrieve the **unity of God** and **inseparable operations**, which remain indispensable for catechesis and ecumenical dialogue.

Limitations arise where Molnar’s **Barthian commitments** generate tension with magisterial accounts of **natural theology**. While he carefully subordinates the **analogia entis** to the **analogia fidei**, some readers will judge his suspicion of nature’s capacities too strong relative to **Vatican I** and **Catechism** affirmations of knowing God by reason. Similarly, his strong emphasis on **divine impassibility** as love’s form may seem underdeveloped in relation to contemporary theologies of suffering. These tensions, however, do not undermine his central contribution: the defense of **divine freedom** and **immanent Trinity** as the necessary ground of **objective revelation** in Christ and the Spirit.

#### 10. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Molnar’s theology offers significant convergences and instructive divergences. On the positive side, his defense of **divine aseity**, **immutability**, and the **immanent Trinity**, his critique of **social trinitarianism**, and his insistence on the **objectivity of revelation** align with classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and with Westminster’s interest in God’s independence and sovereign grace. His strong affirmation of **Chalcedonian Christology**, **bodily resurrection**, and the **inseparable operations** also accords with confessional standards. Yet his reliance on **Barth** and **Torrance** introduces tensions with Westminster’s **Scripture principle**. Where **Barth’s doctrine of Scripture** construes the Bible as fallible human witness elevated by the Spirit, Westminster confesses Scripture as the **inerrant Word of God** written. Where Molnar follows Barth in subordinating or rejecting **natural theology**, classic Reformed scholasticism affirms a real **natural knowledge of God** while denying its saving sufficiency, though Van Tillian strands would resonate with Molnar’s polemic against autonomy. Moreover, Barth’s **actualistic election** and the threat of **universalism** raise concerns for a covenantal order grounded in **eternal decree**, including **law-gospel** distinction and the **covenant of works**, which Molnar does not foreground. Finally, Molnar’s Catholic setting implies sacramental and ecclesial commitments that Reformed theology would reframe under **Word and sacrament** as means of grace subordinated strictly to Scripture. Still, on the principles of **revelation**, **Trinity**, and **divine freedom**, Westminster readers can find in Molnar a rigorous ally against both **historicized theologies** and **experiential reductionism**, even as they would propose a stronger **doctrine of Scripture**, a modest **natural theology**, and a covenantal dogmatics as corrective complements.
