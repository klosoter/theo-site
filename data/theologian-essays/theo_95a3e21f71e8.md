### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and vocation
D. Stephen Long emerges within the ferment of late modern **theological ethics**, shaped by **postliberalism** under **Stanley Hauerwas**, engaged with **Radical Orthodoxy** while maintaining a distinct **Wesleyan** identity, and situated amid the ascendency of neoliberal **economics** after 1989. Trained in the United States and ordained in the **United Methodist Church**, he taught at **Marquette University** and later at **Southern Methodist University**’s **Perkins School of Theology**, forging a profile that combines **ecclesial ministry** with academic **systematic theology**. From the outset, he resists the fragmentation of **ethics**, **doctrine**, and **politics**, insisting that the church’s worship orders its **ordo amoris** for truthful social witness. The historical horizon is set by the legacies of **Aquinas** and **Augustine**, the disruptions of **Kantian moral autonomy**, the crisis of **liberal Protestantism**, and the expansion of **market rationality** into the moral imagination. Within this context, Long’s enduring thesis is that **classical theism** and **holiness ecclesiology** supply the metaphysical and communal conditions for truthful Christian speech and action, an argument worked out through critical engagements with **Karl Barth**, **Hans Urs von Balthasar**, **John Milbank**, and contemporary **analytic** and **process** proposals.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Long’s method is a disciplined **ecclesial reasoning** that binds **doctrine** and **ethics** within a sacramental **ontology**. He retrieves **Aquinas** to defend **divine simplicity** and **analogia entis**, while learning from **Barth** the primacy of **revelation** and the cruciform **Christology** that orders theological language toward the **Triune God**. In **Speaking of God: Theology, Language, and Truth** (2009), he argues that Christian discourse is neither reducible to **expressivist** culture nor to a **foundationalist** metaphysic; truth is governed by God’s **ipsa veritas** disclosed in Scripture, confessed in the **creeds**, and enacted in the **liturgy**. The epistemic posture is non-competitive: grace does not negate nature but heals and elevates it, a distinctly **Thomist** axiom refracted through **Wesleyan** accounts of **prevenient grace** and **sanctification**. Long thus opposes **Kantian autonomy** and the **univocity of being** that flattens Creator and creature, yet he also resists fideist closures that would exile **metaphysical** predication from Christian truth claims. His method is a ressourcement of **classical metaphysics** for contemporary **public theology**, insisting that right worship forms truthful speech and moral agency.

#### 3. Theology and economics
The early landmark **Divine Economy: Theology and the Market** (2000) extends a comprehensive **political theology** by interrogating capitalism’s tacit **metaphysics**. Long claims that the modern market is not only a mechanism for exchange but a moral pedagogy that scripts desires, defines **risk**, and naturalizes **usury**, a practice consistently condemned in the **patristic** and **medieval** church. Deploying **Augustine’s ordo amoris** and **Aquinas’s** account of **justice**, he argues that the market’s alleged neutrality masks a rival **soteriology** promising freedom through consumption and scarcity management. The church’s counter-witness is Eucharistic: **Eucharist** reorders desire to the **Triune gift**, reconstituting political economy as an economy of **gift** rather than predation. In **The Goodness of God: Theology, the Church and Social Order** (2001), Long extends this into **public theology**, contending that the church’s **sanctification** yields practices of **mercy**, **hospitality**, and **poverty relief** that witness to the **common good**. Rather than baptize neoliberalism or retreat into sectarian quietism, Long’s **Wesleyan** social holiness marks a via media whereby **doctrine** and **discipleship** denounce **idolatry** and cultivate prudent, patient alternatives to market hegemony.

#### 4. Language, truth, and metaphysics
In **Speaking of God** (2009) and **Theology and Culture: A Guide to the Discussion** (2008), Long treats the crisis of theological **language** under conditions of **postmodernity**, where claims to **truth** are viewed as will to power or sheer tradition-bound grammar. Against both relativist and positivist reductions, he revitalizes **analogia entis** as a theological grammar for naming God truthfully without collapsing transcendence. The analogical interval honors **divine simplicity** and **aseity**, while permitting meaningful predication disciplined by **Scripture** and **dogma**. Here Long disputes **social trinitarianism**, **process theism**, and **open theism**, each of which risks construing God as one item among others in a cosmic field of relations. He argues that Christian truth is liturgically and doctrinally formed, yet not thereby provincial, because the **Triune God** grounds the metaphysical conditions of creaturely participation. The result is a theologically realist account of **language and truth** in which ecclesial practices of **worship**, **catechesis**, and **sacrament** conduce to reliable speech about God, the world, and the moral life, refusing both **fideist** retreat and **Enlightenment** neutrality.

#### 5. Barth through Balthasar: reconsidering analogical knowledge of God
With **Saving Karl Barth: Hans Urs von Balthasar’s Preoccupation** (2014), Long intervenes in a long-running dispute about **Barth’s** repudiation of the **analogia entis**. He contends that **Balthasar’s** reading demonstrates how Barth’s vehement no to a self-standing **natural theology** did not foreclose analogical participation once grace had established the covenantal relation. Long mines **Barth’s Church Dogmatics** to show a material openness to analogical reasoning under the governance of **revelation**, reframing the Barthian denial as a protest against **autonomous metaphysics** rather than against **metaphysics** per se. This reframing permits a rapprochement between **Barthian** christological concentration and **Thomist** participatory metaphysics, a move consistent with Long’s broader **ecumenical** project uniting **Wesleyan holiness** with **catholic** dogmatic clarity. By reading Barth with Balthasar, Long resists both a **neo-orthodox** suspicion of being and a **Radical Orthodoxy** exuberance about participation that blurs the **Creator-creature distinction**. The upshot is a chastened **analogia entis**: not a ladder of ascent, but a grace-ordered fittingness by which creatures truly speak of God who is **ipsum esse subsistens** and whose self-revelation in Christ remains sovereign.

#### 6. Trinity, simplicity, and the legacy of Aquinas
In **The Perfectly Simple Triune God: Aquinas and His Legacy** (2016), Long advances a robust defense of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** within a fully **Trinitarian** frame. He contests the modern suspicion that simplicity undermines **personal** differentiation, arguing that for **Aquinas** the divine **processions** and **relations of origin** are the very mode of God’s triune plenitude, not parts that compose a greater whole. Against **social trinitarianism** that models God on human community, and against **process** or **open theist** revisions that locate divine love in affective change, Long reasserts that **act purus** grounds the reliability of divine love as unceasingly self-giving without reactive passions. He shows how **simplicity** safeguards **aseity** and **creatio ex nihilo**, secures the **analogia entis**, and stabilizes the moral life by anchoring **providence** and **grace** in the eternal **Triune** life. Critically, Long also retrieves **divine names** and **apophasis** to discipline cataphatic speech, thereby coordinating **doctrine of God** with his larger program on **theological language**. His argument is not antiquarian but pastoral: only the **perfectly simple** God can be confessed as faithful amid suffering and economic violence, a claim that loops back to his **theological ethics**.

#### 7. Wesleyan holiness, ecclesial practices, and public witness
Long’s **Methodist** identity matters most in his treatment of **sanctification** and **social holiness**, where **John Wesley’s** vision of holy love pervading heart and society animates ecclesial practices. In **The Goodness of God** (2001) and throughout his essays, he reads **Wesleyan perfection** as participation in **charity** rather than Pelagian attainment, accommodating **Augustine’s** primacy of grace with **Wesley’s** insistence on growth in holiness through the **means of grace**. He emphasizes **Eucharist**, **baptism**, **catechesis**, and the **works of mercy** as habits by which God reforms desire and renders the church a truthful polity. Publicly, Long advocates neither Constantinian chaplaincy nor sectarian withdrawal; instead, he calls for a Eucharistic **politics** that criticizes **nationalism**, questions **militarism** through the lenses of **peaceableness** and the classical **just war** tradition, and practices economic **solidarity** against **usury** and exploitative debt. This ecclesial center of gravity makes his **systematic theology** inseparable from pastoral and social formation, showcasing how **doctrine of God**, **Christology**, and **Trinity** bear directly upon Christian **virtue** and public action.

#### 8. Culture, modernity, and the university
With **Theology and Culture: A Guide to the Discussion** (2008), Long maps the contested terrain of **modernity**, **secularization**, and the place of **theology** in the **university**. He resists both capitulation to **secular canons** of rationality and the temptation to insulate theology from **public reason**. Building on **Aquinas’s** confidence in the unity of truth and attuned to **Hauerwas’s** ecclesial emphasis, he argues for a theological presence in the academy that witnesses to **truth** as participation in the **Triune God** rather than as mere method. The church’s intellectual life must not abstract from **worship**, nor must **ethics** be severed from **dogmatics**. Here the retrieval of **natural law** appears in a nuanced key: Long affirms a participatory **lex naturalis** healed by **grace**, eschewing autonomous rationalism while refusing to cede the moral field to pure decision or emotivism. The resulting account encourages theologians to engage **law**, **economics**, and **political theory** without abandoning the **creeds** and the **sacraments** as the grammar of Christian intellectual labor.

#### 9. Interlocutors and disputes: Radical Orthodoxy, analytic theology, and liberal Protestantism
Long’s work triangulates between **Radical Orthodoxy**, **analytic theology**, and **liberal Protestantism**, adopting and resisting each in turn. From **Radical Orthodoxy** he shares the critique of **secular reason** and the call for a **sacramental ontology**, while guarding the **Creator-creature distinction** through **divine simplicity** more carefully than some RO exuberances. He engages **analytic theology** sympathetically on clarity and argument, yet challenges **social trinitarianism** and models of **divine passibility** that domesticate **aseity**. Against **liberal Protestantism**, he refuses to reduce **doctrine** to moral uplift or cultural mediation, insisting that **revelation** and **dogma** are norming for **ethics** and **public life**. Theologically, he aligns with **Balthasar** and a chastened **Barth** to reconceive **analogy**, while his **Wesleyan** concerns for sanctification and **holiness** refrain from the moralisms endemic to post-Kantian theology. Throughout, Long’s distinctive contribution is to show how **classical theism**, far from inhibiting Christian witness, supplies the metaphysical stability and doxological depth necessary for sustainable **ecclesial ethics** in a market-saturated age.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and especially **WTS** vantage, Long’s retrieval of **classical theism** is a major strength. His defenses of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, **aseity**, and the priority of **revelation** resonate with **Reformed scholasticism** from **Turretin** to **Bavinck**, and his critique of the market’s **idolatry** echoes **Kuyperian** and **neo-Calvinist** suspicions of ideological lordships. Yet tensions remain. First, his rehabilitated **analogia entis** sits uneasily with **Van Tilian** commitments to **covenantal epistemology**, which reject any analogical bridge not strictly generated by **special revelation** and the **covenant**. Second, his **Wesleyan perfection** and emphasis on cooperative **sanctification** can appear synergistic relative to **monergistic** Reformed accounts, risking inflation of ecclesial practices into conditions of grace rather than instruments of God’s unilateral work. Third, his sacramental **ontology** and Eucharistic **politics** may blur law-gospel and two-kingdom distinctions prized by some **Reformed** streams, even as others would welcome his **public theology**. A Reformed alternative would retain Long’s **classical theism** and market critique while re-grounding **analogy** in **covenant revelation**, clarifying that all **natural law** participation is a providential effect of **general revelation**, and recasting **sanctification** as the Spirit’s sovereign application of **union with Christ** rather than as perfected habitus. Even so, Long’s body of work remains a salutary ally in defending **divine simplicity** and resisting the market’s false **soteriology**.
