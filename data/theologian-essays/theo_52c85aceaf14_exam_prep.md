### TITLE
Jonathan Edwards weds high Reformed orthodoxy to an expansive metaphysical vision of God’s glory and affections, giving a profound but at points destabilizing account of revival, desire, and divine beauty.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Jonathan Edwards** ministers in early eighteenth‑century **New England Puritanism** during the **Enlightenment** and the **Great Awakening** (1703–1758), negotiating between **Reformed orthodoxy** and emerging modernity.
- He writes in a transatlantic world shaped by **Lockean empiricism**, **Newtonian science**, and the decline of robust **Puritan** ecclesial culture in colonial **Northampton** and later **Stockbridge**.

- Edwards’ method is rigorously **biblical**, yet he freely deploys **philosophical metaphysics** and **Lockean psychology** in service of **Reformed** doctrine.
- He treats **religious experience** and the **affections** as crucial data, but insists they must be normed by **Scripture** and the **sovereign work of the Spirit**.
- He operates with a strong sense of **redemptive history**, seeing all of **history** as the unfolding of God’s **covenantal purposes** for the display of divine glory.

- In **A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God** (1737), Edwards interprets revival in **Northampton** as a genuine work of the **Holy Spirit** distinguished by transformed affections and lives.
- In **Religious Affections** (1746), he argues that true **regeneration** is known by a new, supernatural sense of the **beauty of God**, producing holy affections and persevering fruit.
- In **Freedom of the Will** (1754), he defends **compatibilist freedom** and **meticulous divine sovereignty** against **Arminian** and **libertarian** accounts of the will.
- In **The End for Which God Created the World** (written c. 1755, published 1765), he presents a rich metaphysical account of **God’s glory** as the ultimate end of creation and redemption.

- Edwards is decisive for **soteriology**, especially **regeneration**, **assurance**, and the nature of **saving faith** and the **affections**.
- He makes major contributions to the Reformed understanding of **providence and freedom**, and to **revival theology** and the discernment of the **work of the Spirit**.
- His metaphysical reflections deeply influence later Reformed accounts of **God’s glory**, **beauty**, and the relation of **Creator and creation**.

- For a Westminster exam, you must receive **Edwards** as a high **Calvinist** and a profound theologian of **grace**, while clearly qualifying his more speculative **metaphysics of being and idealism**.
- You should affirm his **doctrines of sovereignty, sin, and regeneration**, yet flag concerns about his language on **continuous creation**, **occasionalism**, and some trajectories in his **revivalism**.

- Compare **Edwards and Calvin** on **regeneration, assurance, and the Christian life**, especially the role of **affections** versus **Word and sacrament**.
- Compare **Edwards and Turretin or Bavinck** on **providence, freedom, and divine simplicity**, and **Edwards and Wesley** on **revival, perfectionism, and assurance**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
Jonathan **Edwards** was born in **1703** in **East Windsor, Connecticut**, the son of minister **Timothy Edwards**, and he died in **1758** shortly after becoming president of the College of **New Jersey** later Princeton. Educated at **Yale**, he was formed by late **Puritan scholastic** theology, by the experiential piety of **English dissent**, and by the rising influence of **Lockean empiricism** and **Newtonian science**. Ordained in **Northampton** as assistant and then successor to his grandfather **Solomon Stoddard**, Edwards faced a declining **Puritan** culture, formalism in church life, and growing Enlightenment rationalism. The outbreak of the **First Great Awakening** in the 1730s and 1740s, first in Northampton and then more widely through the preaching of **George Whitefield**, provided him both an opportunity and a crisis. Theologically, the driving problem that organizes his work is how to articulate a robustly **Reformed doctrine of God, grace, and regeneration** in a context of cultural secularization, psychological introspection, and contested revival phenomena.

This core problem appears as a threefold burden in his ministry and writing. First, Edwards must defend the sheer **sovereignty of God** and the bondage of the will against rising **Arminian** and proto‑liberal tendencies in New England. Second, he must give a nuanced account of **religious experience** that neither collapses into dead formalism nor into **enthusiastic** subjectivism, which he confronted in both supporters and critics of the revivals. Third, he must reassert the God‑centeredness of all things, insisting that **God’s glory** is both the ultimate end of creation and the deepest good of the creature. His response to these problems employed the full range of his intellectual tools, from **biblical exegesis** and **Puritan practical divinity** to a highly original **metaphysical vision** of reality as dependent on and expressive of the triune God.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Edwards’ formal principle is the absolute authority of **Scripture** as the Word of God, received within the **Reformed** confessional tradition. His sermons and treatises are saturated with biblical citation and argument, and he consciously stands with **Calvin**, the **Westminster Standards**, and the New England **Puritan** divines in doctrines like total depravity, unconditional election, and justification by faith alone. Yet his method is not biblicism; he reads Scripture with a sense of the analogia fidei, of canonical unity, and of **redemptive history**, as seen in works like **History of the Work of Redemption**. Scripture is the controlling norm, but it is read with an eye to what he calls the **consent of Scripture**, the internal harmony that reveals God’s overarching purpose to glorify himself in Christ.

At the same time, Edwards freely employs **reason**, **experience**, and **history** as subordinate but important sources in theology. He is deeply shaped by **John Locke’s** *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* and appropriates Lockean language of **ideas**, **sense**, and **habit**, yet he subordinates this psychology to a strong **Augustinian** and **Calvinist** doctrine of sin and grace. In **Religious Affections**, for example, he distinguishes between natural and spiritual affections using both biblical categories and psychological analysis. He treats **religious experience** as crucial phenomenological data, but insists that experience must be tested by Scripture and especially by the marks of a truly gracious work of the **Spirit** in producing humility, love to God, and perseverance. His famous revival narratives, especially **A Faithful Narrative of the Surprising Work of God**, integrate exegesis, pastoral observation, and historical description as a kind of theological empiricism.

Philosophically, Edwards engages **metaphysics** in ways that stretch but do not wholly abandon classical **Reformed scholasticism**. In works related to **Freedom of the Will** and his **Miscellanies**, he argues for a robust **compatibilism** and an almost **occasionalist** doctrine of causation, stressing that all being and all motion are effects of God’s constant willing. His language of **continuous creation** and of the world as dependent on God’s immediate upholding verges on a form of idealism in which creaturely existence is the constant communication of divine ideas. Here, a Westminster examiner will want to note both continuity and tension with classical doctrines of **secondary causality** and **divine simplicity** in **Turretin** and **Bavinck**. Edwards aims to exalt God’s sovereignty and beauty, but he sometimes does so by speculative moves that require careful qualification within a stricter confessional framework.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **providence, freedom, and sin**, the Reformed confessions teach meticulous divine providence, Adamic federal headship, total depravity, and the compatibility of divine sovereignty with responsible human action. In **Freedom of the Will** (1754), Edwards gives perhaps the most sophisticated early modern defense of **Reformed compatibilism**. Against **Arminian** and **Wesleyan** accounts that posit a self‑determining power of contrary choice, Edwards argues that the will is as the greatest apparent good is; in other words, the will necessarily chooses according to the strongest motive as apprehended by the mind. Therefore, moral inability arises not from lack of natural powers but from a corrupt disposition. This preserves both human responsibility and the necessity of regenerating grace. Edwards’ interlocutors include **Daniel Whitby** and the broader **Arminian** tradition. While standing with **Calvin** and **Turretin** in affirming unconditional election and total inability, his almost deterministic account of causation and his tendency toward **occasionalism** create tension with more traditional Reformed accounts of stable secondary causes and a thicker account of the will as faculty.

Second, in the locus of **regeneration, faith, and the affections**, the classic Reformed view teaches that regeneration is a sovereign work of the **Holy Spirit** producing faith, that saving faith embraces Christ in knowledge, assent, and trust, and that the Christian life is characterized by sanctification in love and obedience. Edwards’ most influential contribution here is **Religious Affections** (1746), written after the turmoil of the **Great Awakening**. He insists that true religion, in large part, consists in holy **affections**, which he defines as vigorous exercises of the inclination of the soul. Against both cold formalism and unbridled enthusiasm represented by some revival excesses and critics like **Charles Chauncy**, he sets forth twelve signs of gracious affections. The key thesis is that saving grace gives a new spiritual sense of the **beauty and excellency of God** in Christ, which produces a new disposition of the heart and a life of persevering holiness. This account deepens the Reformed emphasis on experiential piety in **Owen** and the **Puritans**, but it also raises questions about assurance and introspection, as later critics worry that Edwards’ detailed phenomenology of experience could foster morbid self‑analysis rather than resting on the objective promises of the gospel and the means of grace.

Third, in the doctrine of **God, glory, and creation**, the Reformed baseline affirms God’s self‑sufficiency, the **Trinity**, the Creator‑creature distinction, and that God freely created all things for the manifestation of his glory. In **The End for Which God Created the World** (written circa 1755, published 1765), Edwards offers a profound metaphysical account of **God’s glory** as the ultimate end of creation. Against more anthropocentric or moralistic accounts, he argues that God is essentially communicative and that the triune life is an eternal fullness of knowledge and love that naturally overflows in the communication of God’s glory to creatures. The end of creation is that this glory be both displayed and enjoyed, so that the creature’s highest happiness in God coincides with the divine purpose to glorify himself. Edwards engages interlocutors like **Joseph Bellamy** and the broader **New Divinity** in refining this God‑centered teleology. This vision has been warmly received by later Reformed theologians like **Bavinck** and **Piper**, yet Edwards’ speculative metaphysics and his use of concepts like **emanation** and the world as an ideal expression of divine being demand careful safeguarding of divine aseity, the Creator‑creature distinction, and classical **Trinitarian** doctrine as articulated in the **Westminster Confession**.

Fourth, in the locus of **church, sacraments, and revival**, the Reformed confessions emphasize the visible church as the ordinary locus of the Word and sacraments, the necessity of credible profession for admission to the Lord’s Table, and the sufficiency of ordinary means for salvation. Edwards’ pastoral practice and writings, especially **A Faithful Narrative** and his later works on revival, shape a distinct **Reformed revivalism**. Early on, under the influence of his grandfather **Stoddard**, he tolerated a broader **half‑way covenant** approach, but he later vehemently defended a strict requirement of credible conversion for admission to the **Lord’s Supper**, which eventually led to his dismissal from Northampton in 1750. He warmly embraced the **Great Awakening** as a work of God, defending it against critics while carefully critiquing excesses, bodily phenomena, and spiritual pride. His ecclesiology and sacramental practice thus tightened **Puritan** discipline and highlighted experimental piety, yet his exaltation of revival and intense focus on extraordinary seasons of the Spirit can tend to relativize the ordinary ministry of Word and sacrament that **Calvin** and later **Vos** and **Murray** would prioritize. This tension becomes acute in some strands of later **evangelicalism** that claim Edwards while neglecting his high view of the church and means of grace.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Within the stream of **Reformed orthodoxy**, Edwards stands as both heir and innovator. He consciously aligns with **Calvin**, **Owen**, and the **Westminster Standards** on the doctrines of God, sin, election, and justification, and he may rightly be called the last great **Puritan**. His soteriology, including **penal substitution**, imputation, and the necessity of regeneration, fits comfortably within the confessional tradition, and his defense of **meticulous providence** and compatibilist freedom extends the older scholastic work of **Turretin**. Yet, his constructive metaphysics, especially his language of **continuous creation**, his heavy use of **idealism** and occasionalism, and some of his speculative suggestions about the **Trinity** and the nature of created being, do not fit easily within the more cautious metaphysical posture of the confessions and of later Reformed dogmatics.

Later Reformed theologians have variously appropriated and critiqued **Edwards**. **Bavinck** praises his God‑centered teleology and his stress on the glory of God as the end of all things, yet warns against dissolving created reality into a mere manifestation of divine ideas. **Vos** recognizes Edwards as an important precursor in viewing history as the unfolding of the **covenant of grace** and the kingdom, but would resist any blurring of redemptive history with metaphysical speculation. **Van Til** warmly affirms Edwards’ antithesis between Creator and creature and his rigorous rejection of **autonomous human reason**, but is wary of how some of Edwards’ philosophical categories might compromise analogical reasoning and the principial self‑sufficiency of God. From a Westminster vantage point, at least two objections are necessary: first, we must object to any reading of Edwards that turns his metaphysics into a quasi‑pantheistic **emanationism** or that undermines robust **secondary causality**; second, we must reject revivalist trajectories inspired by Edwards that minimize the instituted church and the ordinary means of grace. At the same time, we learn from him a God‑centered vision of reality, a profound account of **regeneration and the affections**, and a zeal to interpret **history and experience** through the lens of Scripture and the glory of God in Christ.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, certain sentences about **Jonathan Edwards** are both accurate and safe as opening lines. You can say, for example, that Edwards is the greatest **Reformed theologian** produced in colonial America, a high **Calvinist** who brought together Puritan piety, Enlightenment tools, and a massive vision of the glory of God. It is also safe to say that he is a theologian of the **affections**, convinced that true religion consists very much in a supernatural sense of the beauty of God that transforms the heart and life. Examiners at Westminster will resonate with language that highlights his God‑centeredness, his defense of **divine sovereignty and compatibilism**, and his insistence on the necessity of **regeneration** for true faith.

By contrast, there are phrases that must be avoided or carefully qualified. You should not speak loosely of Edwards’ **idealism** or **continuous creation** as if he were a proto‑pantheist, nor should you describe his view of God and the world as a simple *analogia entis* in a Thomistic sense. You must avoid suggesting that he reduces Christianity to **religious experience** in a way akin to **Schleiermacher**; for Edwards, experience is always normed by **Scripture** and oriented to God’s glory in Christ. Be careful not to imply any sympathy for **universalism** or for later **New Divinity** abuses of his thought, such as diminishing the particularity of the atonement or overemphasizing disinterested benevolence. Likewise, avoid language that seems to endorse a **revivalist ecclesiology** that sidelines the ordinary means of grace; Edwards himself was far more churchly and confessional than many of his heirs.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings students have about Edwards. One common error is to treat him primarily as a philosopher of religious psychology rather than as a **Reformed dogmatician** who uses psychology in service of classic doctrines of sin and grace. Another is to assume that his emphasis on affections leads to a subjectivist account of assurance, when in fact Edwards roots assurance in the **Spirit’s work** as evidenced in persevering holiness and love, tied to the promises of **Scripture**. A third misunderstanding is to lump Edwards together with **Wesleyan** revivalism, ignoring his strong doctrines of election, particular redemption, and total inability. A fourth is to imagine that his metaphysical speculations license later liberal or process accounts of God and the world, when Edwards remains firmly committed to divine aseity, omnipotence, and the **Creator‑creature distinction**. In an exam, you will want to emphasize that Edwards is best read as a creative but loyal son of **Reformed scholasticism**, whose innovations must be judged in light of confessional norms, not as a free‑floating modern religious genius.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Jonathan **Edwards** should be affirmed as a towering **Reformed theologian** whose defense of divine sovereignty, total depravity, compatibilist freedom, penal substitution, and the necessity of supernatural regeneration stands squarely within confessional orthodoxy, and whose rich account of God’s glory, the affections, and revival can still instruct the church; yet we must firmly deny any suggestion that his metaphysics of **continuous creation**, his near‑occasionalism, or his revivalist emphases license weakening the Creator‑creature distinction, diminishing robust secondary causes, or relativizing the ordinary means of grace, so when pressed we should say that we gratefully receive Edwards as a profound, if somewhat speculative, Reformed pastor‑theologian, while norming his metaphysical and ecclesiological proposals by the clearer teaching of **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Standards**.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Jonathan **Edwards** is the greatest colonial American **Reformed theologian**, marrying Puritan orthodoxy, Enlightenment tools, and a massive vision of God’s glory and the transformed affections.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born **1703** in East Windsor, minister in **Northampton** and **Stockbridge**, dies in **1758** as president of the College of **New Jersey**.
- **Religious Affections** (1746) and **Freedom of the Will** (1754) define his theology of regeneration, affections, and compatibilist freedom.
- **The End for Which God Created the World** (c. 1755/1765) and **A Faithful Narrative** (1737) express his God‑centered teleology and revival theology.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Edwards treats **Scripture** as supreme authority, read in light of the **Reformed confessions** and the unity of redemptive history.
- He uses **Lockean psychology** and **metaphysics** as subordinate tools in service of biblically grounded doctrine.
- He takes **religious experience** and revival history seriously but insists they be normed by **biblical marks** of a gracious work of the **Spirit**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In **Freedom of the Will**, he defends a strong **compatibilism**, arguing that the will necessarily follows the strongest motive and that sinners have moral inability apart from grace.
- In **Religious Affections**, he claims true religion consists much in holy **affections**, a new supernatural sense of the **beauty and excellency of God** in Christ.
- In **The End for Which God Created the World**, he argues that God created to communicate and display his own **glory**, so that divine self‑glorification and creaturely happiness coincide.
- In his revival writings, he develops a nuanced **revival theology**, defending the **Great Awakening** as a work of God while critiquing enthusiasm and emphasizing lasting spiritual fruit.
- His speculative **metaphysics of continuous creation** and near **occasionalism** aim to exalt divine sovereignty but press against classical **secondary causality**.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press his near‑**idealism** and **continuous creation** language for possible risks to the Creator‑creature distinction and secondary causes.
- They will probe whether his emphasis on **affections** and experience threatens the objective centrality of **Word and sacrament** in assurance and sanctification.
- They will question how his high view of **revival** relates to ordinary **church** life and the instituted means of grace.
- They will examine whether his metaphysical rhetoric about **emanation** and the communication of glory is safely bounded by confessional **Trinitarian** and **providence** doctrine.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Edwards vs Calvin** on the Christian life and **assurance**, especially the role of **affections** versus resting in promises and sacraments.
- **Edwards vs Wesley** on **revival, free will, and perfectionism**, contrasting Calvinist compatibilism with Arminian synergism.
- **Edwards vs Turretin** on **providence and causality**, comparing Edwards’ near‑occasionalism with classic secondary causes.
- **Edwards vs Bavinck/Van Til** on **metaphysics and the Creator‑creature distinction**, weighing his idealist language against later Reformed insistence on analogical reasoning.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Jonathan **Edwards** is a profound and largely faithful Reformed theologian of God’s glory, sovereignty, and the affections, whose speculative metaphysics and revivalism must be gratefully mined yet carefully bounded by the **Westminster Standards**.
