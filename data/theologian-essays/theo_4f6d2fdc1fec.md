### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Paul K. Moser emerged from late twentieth-century **analytic epistemology** into the arena of **philosophical theology** as disputes over **internalism vs externalism**, **skepticism**, and the status of **evidence** were reshaping the field. Trained as a rigorous epistemologist, Moser first addressed the logic of **justification** and **evidential support** in early works like **Knowledge and Evidence** in 1989, where he developed a realist but nuanced account of **epistemic fit**. He then advanced beyond the inherited ideal of **spectator objectivity** in **Philosophy after Objectivity** in 1993, arguing that human knowing is inescapably situated and purposive, though still responsibly answerable to **truth**. This trajectory prepared his distinctive confessional claim in **philosophical theology**: that the God of **Christian theism** would not traffic in merely neutral, observer-friendly data, but would offer **person-involving evidence** aimed at the transformation of will and life. Moser thus relocates *cognitio Dei* within the sphere of **divine authority** and **agape**, fashioning an **obedience-model of knowledge** in which knowledge of God is inseparable from **discipleship** under the risen **Christ**.

This methodological relocation grows from the conviction that the standard analytic quest for **publicly available, coercive evidence** misdiagnoses the divine project. If God is perfectly loving and authoritative, Moser contends, then God’s self-disclosure will be governed by **moral ends**, not by the epistemologist’s demand for neutrality. The right response, accordingly, is **volitional receptivity** rather than mere cognitive assent, echoing **Kierkegaard’s** critique of detached **Christendom** and **Augustine’s ordo amoris** in which love orders cognition. Moser names the contrary posture **cognitive idolatry**, where the inquirer seeks a god domesticated to the canons of **spectator evidence**. Against such idolatry, he advances **Christ-shaped philosophy**, in which the epistemic virtues are cruciform and the norming norm is the **Spirit’s authoritative call** witnessed in **Scripture** and experienced in conscience and community.

#### 2. From epistemology to theological reorientation
In **Knowledge and Evidence** in 1989, Moser explores the contours of **epistemic justification** and the nature of **evidence** that confers creditable belief. While analytic in register, this work prefigures his later shift by stressing the active involvement of the knower. By **Philosophy after Objectivity** in 1993, he directly challenges the myth of a view from nowhere. The book’s thesis is not relativism but **responsible perspectivalism**, where inquiry acknowledges its **purposive commitments**. This culminates in his theological turn in **The Elusive God: Reorienting Religious Epistemology** in 2008, where he argues that God’s seeming hiddenness is purposeful elusiveness, because God seeks not bare recognition but **agape-shaped fellowship**. The volume targets two foils: the **evidentialism** that demands coercive theistic proofs and the **Reformed Epistemology** that, in his reading, risks evacuating the normativity of **divine authority** by making warranted theistic belief too independent of the **obedience** demanded by the **gospel**.

Moser’s distinctive terms crystallize here. **Person-involving evidence** is evidence that not only supports a proposition but addresses and summons a person under **divine authority**. **Purposively available evidence** is evidence offered under God’s redemptive intention and therefore noncoercive. The **volitional resistance condition** states that resistance to God’s authority can block uptake of such evidence, a theme that reframes **divine hiddenness** as **judgment** and **mercy** together. These claims interweave epistemology and soteriology, proposing that knowledge of God is a species of **obedience** and that **agape transformation** is both condition and fruit of recognition. The conceptual shift is from **God as object** to **God as Lord**, and from evidence as detachable data to evidence as the **Spirit’s address**.

#### 3. Kerygmatic evidentialism and the critique of natural theology
In **The Evidence for God: Religious Knowledge Reexamined** in 2010, Moser characterizes his stance as a kerygmatic evidentialism. He retains the term **evidence** against fideist caricatures but insists that the relevant evidence is the authoritative **kerygma** of the **risen Christ**, mediated by the **Spirit**, rather than a compendium of cosmological or fine-tuning arguments. Here he engages **Richard Swinburne’s** probabilistic **natural theology** and finds it theologically misdirected: a God of perfect authority would not primarily submit to probability calculus appointed by detached observers. Moser also disputes **William Alston’s** doxastic practice model for treating perceptual-like experiences as prima facie justified, since, in Moser’s view, the point is not simply reliable practice but conformity to **divine lordship**. With **Alvin Plantinga**, he shares an anti-evidentialist refusal to make theistic belief hostage to proof, but he charges that **proper basicality** can become too content-neutral, insufficiently keyed to the authority of **Jesus** as Lord and to **sanctification** as the norm of cognitive receptivity.

This kerygmatic turn does not jettison arguments. Moser frequently points to the moral incongruity of the evidentialist demand for neutrality as a kind of **category mistake** about the God of **Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob**, echoing **Pascal’s** contrast between the God of the philosophers and the God of Scripture. He argues that truly **person-involving evidence** appears as the **Spirit’s convicting presence**, the **call to repent** and to embody **agape** in concrete practices, and the **vivifying witness** to the lordship of **Christ** in and through the church’s proclamation and the believer’s conscience. Evidence is thus intrinsically laced with a demand: follow, obey, be remade. The project falls under *fides quaerens intellectum*, but with the insistence that **faith** is not pre-epistemic preference; it is itself elicited by **divine self-disclosure** and tethered to the test of **obedience**.

#### 4. Divine hiddenness, elusiveness, and volitional conditions
Moser’s response to **J. L. Schellenberg’s** argument from **divine hiddenness** anchors **The Elusive God** in 2008 and recurs through **The Severity of God** in 2013 and **The God Relationship** in 2017. Schellenberg claims that a perfectly loving God would ensure that all nonresistant persons enjoy explicit **personal relationship** with God, whereas our world contains apparently nonresistant unbelievers. Moser replies by probing the notion of nonresistance. On his view, because divine evidence is **morally authoritative**, a person can be resistant without explicit hostility, namely by withholding **agape-conformable** openness to God’s lordship. God’s self-presentation is thus **purposively elusive**: it aims to draw persons into **transformative fellowship**, refuses to satisfy **spectator curiosity**, and respects the integrity of human agency. In biblical register, he appeals to **1 Corinthians 2** on the **Spirit’s** enabling knowledge of spiritual things, **John 7:17** on doing God’s will as a condition of discerning teaching, and **Romans 8** on the **Spirit of adoption**. The hiddenness of God is accordingly a by-product of divine **holiness** and our deep-seated **volitional disorder**.

The controversial core is the **volitional resistance condition**. It proposes that if God is morally serious, then epistemic access will co-vary with **surrender** to God’s agape. This underwrites a theologically thick reply to hiddenness: there are fewer truly nonresistant unbelievers than advertised, because resistance can be subtle and ethical. It also articulates why coercive or irresistible evidence would be out of step with God’s ends, since it would generate **assent** without **discipleship**, and might feed **cognitive idolatry** rather than invite **union with Christ**. Moser closes the distance between **epistemology** and **sanctification**, holding that the knowledge of God is cruciform and thus an offense to the proud but light to the meek.

#### 5. Christ-shaped philosophy and the severity of God
The program of **Christ-shaped philosophy** becomes explicit in the edited volume **Jesus and Philosophy** in 2008 and then in Moser’s own **The Severity of God** in 2013. The first argues that **Jesus** is not merely a subject for philosophy of religion but the substantive norm for **philosophy** as such, because in him **wisdom** appears as **incarnate authority**. The latter, often misunderstood, expands the theme by facing the **severity** of divine judgment, jealousy, and purgation as integral to **agape**. Against the sanitization of **love** into sentiment, Moser stresses that God’s love includes surgical severity toward our **idolatry**. The evidence of such a God is therefore not gentle persuasion alone but the afflicted conscience, the unveiled **wrath against sin**, and the severe mercy that rescues us for **holiness**. This confessional turn means that religious epistemology cannot be cordoned off from doctrinal loci such as **hamartiology**, **soteriology**, and **sanctification**. The epistemic upshot is that the most telling signs of God are found where the **cross** cuts into the will and reorders the **ordo amoris**.

The insistence on severity raises a further contrast with **Swinburnean** Bayesianism and with thin **moral arguments** for **theism**. For Moser, the moral life is not evidence for a generic theistic postulate but the sphere where the **Spirit** confronts the will with **lordship**. He thus trades the wide **publicity** of probabilistic arguments for a stricter, kerygmatic **public address** lodged in the **gospel**. The wager is that such evidence is not private but still public in action-guiding import, testable in transformation and communal confession. The language is Augustinian and Pauline, but the structure harks back to **Kierkegaard’s** **offense** and **stumbling block**, where the epistemic scandal of the **crucified Lord** is the site of true knowledge.

#### 6. The God relationship and the ethics of inquiry
In **The God Relationship: The Ethics for Inquiry about the Divine** in 2017, Moser codifies the trajectory as an **ethics-first epistemology**. He argues that any inquiry into God without deference to **divine authority** is morally defective. Inquiry is a kind of **discipleship**, governed by norms of **agape**, **humility**, and **truthfulness** supplied by the **Spirit**. Here Moser gives his most systematic account of **person-involving evidence**. Evidence is person-owning: it engages the inquirer at the level of conscience, character, and community. It is authoritative: it bears a normative claim that outruns description. And it is purposive: it seeks to enlist persons in the **kingdom of God**. The result is a **covenantal** contouring of epistemology, even if Moser’s explicit appeal to **covenant theology** is sparse. The conceptual grammar links **call-and-response**, **lordship and obedience**, and **promise and fulfillment** with **knowledge of God** as the covenant blessing.

At the same time, Moser does not collapse testimony into subjectivism. He speaks of the **Spirit’s witness** as cross-checked by the **apostolic kerygma** in **Scripture**, the communal **church** life that embodies **agape**, and the fruits of the **Spirit** which are publicly tractable. For Moser, Scripture is not mere data but the canonical address of **Christ’s lordship**. Yet he resists equating **biblical authority** with a Scripture-first apologetic, because the divine project is personal transformation, not mere assent to **inerrant propositions**. This emphasis can rankle classical views of **propositional revelation**, but Moser’s burden is to intensify the role of Scripture by situating it as the concrete vehicle of **the Spirit’s authoritative call** rather than a standalone archive of proofs.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debts, and divergences
Moser reads **Plantinga**, **Alston**, and **Swinburne** as indispensable conversation partners. With **Plantinga**, he shares a liberation from evidentialist strictures, yet he reasserts that **warrant** must be conditioned by **obedience** to **divine authority**. With **Alston**, he appropriates the dignity of **doxastic practices**, while insisting that the constitutive practice is **discipleship** under the **Spirit** rather than a perception-analogue. With **Swinburne**, he honors the integrity of **public reason**, but contends that Bayesian confirmation cannot do justice to **Christ’s lordship**. His philosophical debts extend to **Kierkegaard** on **subjective appropriation**, **Augustine** on **ordo amoris** and **illumination**, and **Pascal** on the scandal of the **incarnate God**. The result is a theologically dense **religious epistemology** that subordinates method to **Christology** and embeds knowledge within **sanctification**.

The divergences are equally clear. Moser’s critique of **natural theology** aims not at arguments as such, but at their tendency to sponsor **spectator neutrality** and to yield at most a **deistic** or **generic theism** rather than the **triune** Lord manifest in **Jesus**. Similarly, his adjustments to **Reformed Epistemology** signal a worry that the talk of **proper basicality** can minimize the primacy of **divine authority** in the genesis and governance of belief. Against **Schellenberg**, he redefines the conditions of **nonresistance** in light of moral transformation, thereby reframing hiddenness as a by-product of **holiness** and **mercy**. These moves consolidate Moser’s signature voice: a **kerygmatic evidentialism** under the **Spirit** that claims to be more faithful to **biblical** patterns of knowing.

#### 8. Doctrinal development and conceptual consolidation
Across **The Elusive God** in 2008, **The Evidence for God** in 2010, and **The Severity of God** in 2013, Moser consolidates a network of doctrinal claims suited to **philosophical theology** while stopping short of full **systematics**. On **God**, he emphasizes **moral authority**, **holiness**, and **agape** in a way that implicitly presupposes **divine simplicity** and **aseity**, though he rarely thematizes these metaphysical doctrines. On **Christology**, he insists that the evidence for God is properly **Christ-shaped**, because the **incarnation** reveals the character and aim of God’s self-presentation. On **pneumatology**, he foregrounds the **Spirit’s witness** as the agent of person-involving evidence, invoking Pauline texts to argue that the **Spirit** both convicts and illumines. On **anthropology**, he accentuates the **volitional disorder** of fallen humans and the need for **regeneration** as the enabling condition of knowledge, aligning his epistemology with the soteriological ordo: **calling**, **faith**, **sanctification**.

Perhaps the most original conceptual tool is the recalibration of **evidence** as morally authoritative summons. This preserves a cognitive dimension, because the summons attaches to **truth-claims** about **Christ** and the **kingdom**, but because the claims are delivered by the living **Lord**, their proper uptake requires **repentance** and **obedience**. The transformation criterion functions as a kind of **noetic virtue** condition: those renewed by **agape** display a cognitive receptivity that retrieves **wisdom** rather than the cleverness of the **sage**. In this sense Moser recovers **sapiential theology** inside **analytic philosophy**, pressing against the formalism of late modern **epistemology** and re-centering knowledge on the **fear of the Lord**.

#### 9. Criticisms and limits
Critics raise several concerns about Moser’s **obedience-model of knowledge**. First is the charge of **epistemic circularity** or **bootstrapping**: does one not have to know that God is addressing one before one can rightly take a summons as **divine authority** Rather than dodging, Moser replies that the **Spirit’s witness** is self-authenticating in manner and fruit, analogous to **testimony** that carries its own normative signature, and that **Scripture** supplies a canonical **pattern** for discernment. Second is the worry of **subjectivism**: if the decisive evidence is inwardly **person-involving**, how is this publicly assessable Moser emphasizes the communal and practical **publicity** of transformed life, confession, and ecclesial testing. Third is the tension with **classical apologetics**: by demoting **natural theology**, does Moser foreclose common ground for **public reason** He claims instead to recalibrate common ground as **moral ground**, accessible precisely in the common human struggle with conscience and the summons to **agape**. Finally, some lament the marginal role of **ecclesiology** and **sacramentality** in his proposals. Although he grants the role of **church** and **Scripture** in mediating the **Spirit’s call**, a fuller sacramental ontology is not elaborated, leaving liturgical mediation underdeveloped.

These criticisms do not erase the constructive gain of Moser’s **Christ-shaped philosophy**. He helps the field recover the biblical entanglement of knowledge and **lordship**, refusing the drift into generic **theism** that haunts much **philosophy of religion**. He also reframes the **divine hiddenness** debate with soteriological depth, insisting that the God whose glory is in the face of **Jesus Christ** aims at **communion** rather than **coercion**. For contemporary **philosophical theology**, this is a welcome provocation to think epistemology with **Christology** and **pneumatology**, not apart from them.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Moser’s work exhibits striking convergences and instructive tensions. Convergences include the robust denial of **epistemic neutrality**, akin to **Van Til’s** thesis that all knowing is covenantally situated under **lordship**; the insistence that sin is **noetic** as well as moral; and the accent on the **Spirit’s** role in effectual **illumination**. His critique of **natural theology** as autonomous reason also resonates with a **covenantal apologetic** wary of **pretended neutrality**. Yet tensions abide. First, by defining evidence primarily as the **Spirit’s authoritative call** grasped in obedient openness, Moser risks underplaying **general revelation** and **natural theology** as they function within the Reformed distinction between **archetypal** and **ectypal** knowledge, where **Romans 1** affirms a universal though suppressed knowledge of God. Second, while honoring **Scripture**, Moser does not sufficiently foreground **Scripture as principium cognoscendi** in a formal sense, where the canonical text, not merely the inward call, normatively specifies divine speech. Third, his construal of **nonresistance** risks conflating the ordo of **regeneration** and **faith** with epistemic conditions in a way that may obscure the **covenantal** structure of law and gospel across redemptive history. A Reformed alternative would preserve Moser’s **lordship**-centric noetics while integrating a principled **propositional revelation**, a properly established **natural theology** under Scripture’s critique, and an ecclesially mediated **means of grace** emphasis. Even so, Moser’s bold claim that knowledge of God is **obedience-shaped** stands as a salutary reminder that for Christian theology, epistemology without **discipleship** is not only incomplete but distorted.
