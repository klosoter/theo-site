### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Hughes Oliphant Old, 1933 to 2016, emerged as a leading **Reformed liturgical theologian** in the late twentieth century, working amid the aftermath of **Vatican II**, the **ecumenical liturgical movement**, and the enduring power of American **revivalism**. Ordained in the **Presbyterian** ministry and seasoned by parish pastorates, he developed a scholar-pastor profile uncommon in a field often polarized between antiquarian scholarship and pragmatic church growth. Old became known through his work at Princeton and later as the **John H. Leith Professor of Reformed Theology and Worship** at **Erskine Theological Seminary**, where the **Institute for Reformed Worship** bears his name. His historical acumen was sharpened by immersion in **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformation** sources, joined to an unembarrassed allegiance to **Scripture** and the **confessional** tradition of the **Westminster Standards**.

Old's method is best described as **historical-theological ressourcement**, a retrieval of sources for the sake of the church's present **worship**. He framed the classic maxim **lex orandi, lex credendi**, prayer shapes doctrine, within a **Reformed** hermeneutic that prizes the **regulative principle of worship**, that only what God commands is to be performed in his worship, yet sees the principle as generative when disciplined by whole-Bible patterns. He refused reductive biblicism on the one hand and uncritical traditionalism on the other, insisting that **patristic** and **Reformed** exemplars are witnesses that either illuminate or obscure the **Scripture** that normed them. This dual loyalty, to **Scripture** and to the **fathers and Reformers**, yielded the hallmark of his scholarship: thick description, close reading of **primary texts**, and careful liturgical evaluation ordered by **covenant theology** and the **means of grace**.

#### 2. Corpus and architecture of thought
Old's intellectual architecture took public shape with early retrievals such as **The Patristic Roots of Reformed Worship** 1975, which argued that the **Reformed** liturgy did not spring from polemic alone but from a catholic inheritance filtered through **Augustine** and **Chrysostom** and refined by **Calvin** and **Bucer**. This thesis of **Reformed catholicity** was broadened in **Worship That Is Reformed According to Scripture** 1984, rev. 2002, which gave pastors a constructive account of **Word and sacrament**, **psalmody**, **prayer**, and **discipline** as the structural elements of Lord's Day worship. In **Leading in Prayer** 1995 he offered a school of prayer through the provision of biblically shaped intercessions, litanies, and collects, embodying the craft of **pastoral prayer** recovered from **Calvin** and the **Puritans**. He then deepened his sacramental work in **The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite in the Sixteenth Century** 1992 and **Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church** 2013, showing how **covenant theology** informed the rites without collapsing them into mere didactic exercises.

The crowning achievement is **The Reading and Preaching of the Scriptures in the Worship of the Christian Church** 7 vols., 1998–2010, an encyclopedic history of **lectio** and **homilia** from the apostolic age to the present. Volume 1 addresses the **biblical period**, mapping synagogue **lection** patterns and New Testament **kerygma**; volume 2 treats the **patristic age**, analyzing **Chrysostom's** rhetorical exactitude and **Augustine's** pastoral catechesis; volume 3 assesses **medieval** monastic lectio and scholastic sermons; volume 4 follows the **Reformation**, centering **Calvin's** and **Bucer's** program of **lectio continua** with pastoral application; volume 5 explores **pietism**, **moderate orthodoxy**, and **awakening** preaching, including **Edwards**; volume 6 surveys the **modern age**, noting romantic and liberal turns; and volume 7 narrates **our own time**, with critique and counsel for contemporary **evangelical** and **mainline** pulpits. The series integrates **historical theology**, **rhetoric**, and **pastoral practice**, contending that the public **reading** and **preaching** of Scripture are not incidental but the central acts of Christian worship.

#### 3. The theology of Word and preaching
At the core of Old's project is a theology of the **Word** as a divinely instituted **means of grace**, where **reading** and **preaching** are distinct yet inseparable acts of the church. He argued that the recovered **lectio continua** of the **Reformation** was not only a method of preaching through books of the Bible but a doxological discipline that forms congregations over time. Against homiletical pragmatism and topical fragmentation, Old championed the ancient and **Reformed** practice of sustained **exposition**, the pastoral unfolding of the *sensus literalis* in dependence on the **Spirit**, ordered to **catechesis**, **conversion**, and the **consolation** of the saints. The careful attention to **Chrysostom's** exegesis, **Augustine's** art of teaching, and **Calvin's** weekday sermons showed how catholic resources and **Reformed** convictions converge in a preaching ministry that is doctrinal without pedantry and pastoral without sentimentality.

Old was also keen to expose the theological stakes of pulpit method. To abandon **lectio continua** is to distort the church's diet of **Scripture**, creating a functional canon within the canon. To prize narrative skill over **doctrine** is to sever **lex orandi** from **lex credendi**. The oratorical polish of **late modern homiletics** had to be resubmitted to the pedagogy of **catechesis** and the patience of the **pastoral office**. He portrayed the sermon as the church's sustained hearing of the **covenant Lord** who addresses his people, so that proclamation is covenantal address, evangelical promise, and moral summons bound together. In this frame, **preaching** is not a discussion of religious themes but the living voice of **Scripture**, viva vox Dei, in the midst of the assembly.

#### 4. Sacraments and the ordo of worship
Old's sacramental theology drew deeply from **Calvin** and **Bucer**, emphasizing a **pneumatological real presence** of Christ in **Holy Communion** and a robust **covenant** account of **baptism**. In **Holy Communion in the Piety of the Reformed Church** 2013 he narrates a trajectory from **Geneva's** weekly aspiration, frustrated by magistrates, through **Scottish** and **Puritan** practice, toward modern retrievals of frequent communion. He urged a recovery of the classic **ordo** that unites **Word and sacrament**, not as parallel options but as mutually interpreting gifts. The **Sursum Corda**, the **Great Thanksgiving**, and the **Institution Narrative** were treated as ancient forms that **Reformed** churches could order according to **Scripture**, preserving **Calvin's** preference for richly biblical eucharistic prayer without compromising the sufficiency of Christ's words of institution.

On **baptism**, **The Shaping of the Reformed Baptismal Rite** 1992 explores how **covenant theology**, especially the promise to believers and their children, shaped rites of incorporation and vows of parental nurture. Old pressed for pastoral integrity in baptismal preparation, the recovery of **public profession**, and the liturgical location of baptism within the congregation's **Lord's Day** assembly rather than at private gatherings. He judged that sacramental austerity, a reaction to **Roman** accretions, sometimes eclipsed genuine **sacramental piety** in **Reformed** churches, and he sought to retrieve a devout and disciplined practice consonant with **Westminster's** teaching on the **means of grace**.

#### 5. Prayer, psalmody, and the craft of pastoral leadership
A distinctive contribution of Old is the rehabilitation of **pastoral prayer** and **psalmody** as integral to **Reformed** worship. In **Leading in Prayer** 1995 he assembled a treasury of biblically saturated prayers, modeling the lengthy pastoral intercession cherished by the **Puritans** and the **continental Reformed**. He taught ministers how to order adoration, confession, thanksgiving, and intercession with scriptural cadences, and how to restore congregational participation through the **Amen** and the **Lord's Prayer**. Old advocated renewed **psalm singing**, the recovery of metrical psalters and responsorial forms, not as antiquarian taste but as obedience to the **apostolic** directive to sing psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs understood within a **Reformed** canon of praise.

His wider counsel on leadership pressed for the minister as servant of the **ordo**, not impresario of religious experience. He commended the **Directory for Public Worship** tradition even when working within **Presbyterian** churches that lacked a fixed liturgy, showing that a stable sequence of **call to worship**, **confession and absolution**, **creed**, **scripture readings**, **sermon**, **offering**, **prayers of the people**, and **sacrament** lays the biblical grammar of the gospel upon a congregation. This leadership is not mechanical formalism but covenantal formation, a pedagogy of grace, restoring **catechesis** to worship as the community's school of faith.

#### 6. Catholicity without capitulation
Old's thesis of **Reformed catholicity** insisted that the **Reformed** tradition is a reforming movement within the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church. **The Patristic Roots of Reformed Worship** 1975 traced continuities between the **Genevan Psalter**, the **ancient ordo**, and **Augustinian** spirituality. He read **Calvin** not as an iconoclast of catholic practices but as their evangelical purifier. This argued against two temptations. The first is a truncated **Reformed** identity reduced to negations, where the **regulative principle** becomes a ban rather than a discipline. The second is an uncritical embrace of the **liturgical movement** that smuggles in ceremonial or sacramental presumptions alien to **Reformed** covenant theology. Old proposed that catholic forms are received through **biblical testing**, so that what withstands the trial strengthens **Reformed** worship and what fails it is declined in the name of **sola Scriptura**.

This stance brought Old into conversation with leading liturgists. He engaged **James F. White** on Protestant worship history, appropriated insights from **J. A. Jungmann** on the evolution of the Roman Mass while contesting teleological narratives, and learned from **Alexander Schmemann** the vision of the Eucharist as the eschatological banquet while insisting on a **Calvinist** account of presence. With **Gordon Lathrop** he shared the sense of patterned symbol, yet Old remained wary of typological extravagance unmoored from the **canonical** text. In each case he practiced ecumenical learning without surrendering **Reformed** convictions, a method anchored in **Scripture** and deployed through meticulous use of **primary sources**.

#### 7. The seven-volume history as pastoral theology
The multi-volume **Reading and Preaching** history is both reference work and pastoral theology. Old argued that the church learns to preach by entering a great tradition of **exposition**, not by inventing its voice anew each generation. By attending to **Chrysostom**, **Augustine**, the **Venerable Bede**, **Bernard**, **Wyclif**, **Calvin**, **Perkins**, **Edwards**, **Spurgeon**, and modern voices, the preacher discovers a kinship of craft ordered to **doctrine** and **discipleship**. Old gave special weight to **lectio continua**, tracing its biblical and synagogue antecedents and its renewal in **Geneva**, **Strasbourg**, and **Zurich**. He showed how **Puritan** cycles of exposition underwrote household **catechesis**, and how **awakening** preaching could either intensify or distort the **ordo** when divorcing proclamation from the sacramental life. The series presses the claim that the pulpit must again be disciplined by the **canon**, lection, and the pastoral patience to feed the flock over the long haul.

Old's historical judgments were not antiquarian catalogues. He offered evaluative theses. The medieval sermon failed when it lost the **canonical** sweep and became scholastic disputation detached from the people. Modern Protestantism failed when it absorbed **romantic** subjectivity or **liberal** moral uplift at the expense of **covenantal** proclamation. Evangelicalism fails when the sermon becomes anecdotal exhortation without **exegesis**. The counterthesis is the **Reformed** one: the **Word** read and preached is the chief instrument of the **Spirit**, and worship that honors this will be doctrinally sturdy, missionally potent, and pastorally wise.

#### 8. Contested questions and constructive proposals
Old did not seek controversy, yet his constructive retrieval addressed contested questions within **Reformed** churches. On the **frequency of communion**, he advocated movement toward the **Genevan** aspiration of weekly communion, grounded in **Calvin's** theology of the **means of grace** and the unity of **Word and sacrament**. On **forms** and **set prayers**, he argued that thoughtful use of ancient collects and robust pastoral intercessions are consonant with **regulative** commitments when sourced from **Scripture** and used as pedagogical instruments. On the **church year**, he urged caution but allowed that the major evangelical feasts, **Lord's Day Easter** each week and Christ's nativity, can be observed without conceding to a sacerdotal calendar, provided the **Lord's Day** remains the governing principle. On **music**, he pressed for the primacy of **psalmody** while authorizing well-chosen hymns that echo **biblical** idiom and **confessional** theology.

His polemical target was less ritualism than **pragmatism**. Old saw market-shaped worship as a betrayal of **covenant** identity. The church does not assemble to consume experiences but to be addressed by the **Triune God** through **Word** and **sacrament**. The minister is not a talk show host but a steward of the **mysteries** in the **Pauline** sense, the gospel and its ordinances. The remedy is not romantic nostalgia but a disciplined **ordo** that patterns lives into **discipleship**, feeds the mind with **doctrine**, and warms the heart with **doxology**.

#### 9. Influence and legacy
Old's influence is unusually broad for a liturgical historian. The seven-volume **Reading and Preaching** has become a standard point of departure for **seminary** curricula in homiletics and worship. Pastors in the **PCA**, **OPC**, **EPC**, and **PCUSA** have used **Leading in Prayer** and **Worship That Is Reformed According to Scripture** to reform congregational practices. His retrieval of **lectio continua** has been amplified by expository preachers indebted to **Calvin** and the **Puritans**, while his account of **sacramental piety** has challenged low-church habits that marginalize the Lord's Table. The **Institute for Reformed Worship** associated with Erskine has furthered this retrieval with conferences and publications, embodying Old's pastoral and scholarly synergy.

Old's legacy is also methodological. He modeled how **historical theology** can function as **pastoral theology**, and how a **Reformed** scholar can be deeply **catholic** without capitulating to alien norms. His writing voice, non-polemical, careful, and richly sourced, has made the case that the future of **Reformed worship** lies not in technocratic novelty but in disciplined **ressourcement** under **Scripture**. Even critics concede that Old raised the level of conversation about **Word** and **sacrament**, **prayer**, and the **ordo**, so that disagreement now occurs on more principled and better informed ground.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Old's strengths are profound. He restores the primacy of **special revelation** in public worship through the centrality of **Word** read and preached. He recovers **covenant renewal** as the true shape of the **ordo** and refuses the tyranny of technique. He rightly understands the **regulative principle** as constructive, building a scriptural pattern rather than merely vetoing innovations. His advocacy of **psalmody**, **pastoral prayer**, and **catechesis** aligns with **Westminster** piety. Yet several tensions remain. First, the weight given to **patristic** and **liturgical movement** consensus risks, if mishandled by followers, granting to tradition a quasi-normative status that could blur the sufficiency of **Scripture** in determining worship elements. Second, the positive valuation of set forms and a modest calendar, though judicious, requires strict policing of the **elements versus circumstances** distinction to avoid stealthy ceremonialism. Third, the strong push for frequent communion, while defensible from **Calvin** and commendable pastorally, must be tethered to clear **fencing of the table** and catechetical preparation to preserve **discipline**. The Westminster alternative in principle is to receive Old's **Reformed catholicity** as a hermeneutic of retrieval subordinated to **sola Scriptura**, to deploy **lex orandi, lex credendi** only in service to **revelation**, and to guard the **regulative principle** as a charter for biblically full worship rather than liturgical minimalism or maximalism. Within those bounds, Old's project stands as a luminous resource for churches eager to be both truly **Reformed** and genuinely **catholic** in the worship of the **Triune God**.
