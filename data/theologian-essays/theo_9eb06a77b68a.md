### ESSAY
#### 1. Context, formation, and method
Joshua M. McNall emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** theologian shaped by the **Wesleyan-Holiness** tradition and engaged with post-2000 debates over **atonement**, **epistemology**, and the **unity of Scripture**. His work stands at the intersection of pastoral formation and academic retrieval, refusing the false choice between **doctrinal discipline** and **missional practicality**. In a climate marked by contestation over **penal substitution** and the meaning of the cross, and amid wider skepticism toward theological certainty, McNall positions himself as a **humble realist** who advances a constructive synthesis without capitulating to pluralist relativism. His method draws together premodern metaphors from **Irenaeus** and **Athanasius** with Reformational insights from **Luther** and **Calvin**, while also engaging modern interpreters such as **Gustaf Aulen**, **Scot McKnight**, and **Oliver Crisp** on the landscape of **atonement models**.

McNall describes his approach as **integrative retrieval** guided by **critical realism** and virtue-shaped knowing. He wagers that the biblical canon offers a richly textured set of **soteriological images** whose union is not merely additive but mutually illuminating. Against reductionism that treats one model as exhaustive, his essays and books construct a **mosaic of atonement**, a methodological metaphor that resists both fragmentation and monotony. This posture grows out of the broader evangelical task to hold together **biblical exegesis**, **dogmatic coherence**, and **spiritual formation**, where doctrine serves the church’s communion in **union with Christ** and growth in **holiness**.

#### 2. Major works and the constructive center
The constructive center of McNall’s project appears in **The Mosaic of Atonement** 2019, with an accessible companion in **How Jesus Saves** 2023. Preceding these, **Long Story Short** 2018 articulates a canonical overview in six movements that narrates creation, fall, Israel, Jesus, church, and new creation, thereby framing **soteriology** within the **grand biblical story**. His methodological convictions are then articulated in **Perhaps** 2021, where an evangelical **epistemic humility** is commended, drawing on **critical realism** and habits of charity and hope as antidotes to polarized culture-war certitude. Across these works, the consistent thesis is that evangelical theology must be both canonically comprehensive and doctrinally crisp, integrating diverse metaphors into a unified account of **salvation by grace** through **union with Christ**.

The distinctive emphasis on **union with Christ** plays the role of a conceptual keystone. McNall treats union not as a single tile among others but as the structural mortar that binds **substitution**, **victory**, and **recapitulation** into a coherent whole. The accent on participation retrieves **Athanasius’s** account of the Word’s assuming flesh for our *theosis*, **Irenaeus’s** *recapitulatio* of Adam in Christ, and Reformation affirmations that believers are bone of Christ’s bone by the Spirit’s **unio mystica**. This participatory center allows him to affirm **penal substitution** without isolating it from **Christus Victor** or **sacrificial expiation**, so that juridical and liberative motifs interpret one another within the story of Israel’s God who in Christ becomes our representative and head.

#### 3. The mosaic of atonement: motifs in concert
In **The Mosaic of Atonement** 2019, McNall organizes the material around four interlocking motifs: **incarnational recapitulation**, **sacrifice**, **victory**, and **substitution**. With **recapitulation**, he draws from **Irenaeus** to argue that Christ retraces and heals Adamic life from infancy to death, a soteriological arc that underwrites the possibility of **theosis** as sanctified participation in Christ’s humanity. This places **union with Christ** at the fore, suggesting that divine-human communion is not an afterthought but the ontological ground for every other atonement lens. **Sacrifice** is then recovered through the narrative of Israel’s cult, read with attention to **expiation**, **purification**, and **covenantal communion** rather than caricatures of divine appeasement. In line with **Leviticus** and **Hebrews**, sacrifice functions not only juridically but also as God’s gift of sanctifying presence.

The motif of **Christus Victor** follows the retrieval of **Gustaf Aulen**, though McNall qualifies Aulen’s contrast with the Latin tradition by stressing that the New Testament’s victory language sits fruitfully with **substitution** rather than against it. Here **deliverance from the powers** of sin, death, and Satan is not a rival to legal reconciliation but its warrior complement. Finally, **substitution** is affirmed in penal key yet purified of distortions. Following evangelical stalwarts like **J. I. Packer** and **John Stott**, while heeding criticisms from **Joel Green** and **Mark Baker**, McNall argues that **penal substitution** expresses the covenantal logic of **federal representation** when nested within **union with Christ**, so that judgment and mercy meet in the Son who is both Judge and Substitute. The mosaic image thus signals a non-competitive harmony in which motifs coinhere, each disciplined by **Scripture** and catholic tradition.

#### 4. Interlocutors, disputes, and clarifications
McNall’s dialogue partners include patristic voices such as **Athanasius** and **Irenaeus**, medieval contributions from **Anselm**, and Reformational developments in **Luther** and **Calvin** on **law, gospel, and substitution**. He engages modern debates via **Gustaf Aulen** on **Christus Victor**, **Fleming Rutledge** on the breadth of the cross, and **Scot McKnight** on integrative analogies, though he prefers the **mosaic** over **golf bag** metaphors to preserve doctrinal unity. Among analytic and constructive theologians, figures like **Oliver Crisp** inform McNall’s attention to conceptual clarity and model comparison, while cultural critics like **Rene Girard** prompt careful assessment of **sacrifice** and **scapegoating** without collapsing biblical atonement into social theory.

The disputes that catalyze his synthesis include evangelical arguments over **divine violence**, the charge that **penal substitution** imputes cruelty to God, and concerns that victory or moral influence models can shade into **moralism** or **therapeutic deism**. McNall’s rejoinder is an evangelical **both-and** that disciplines metaphors by canonical exegesis and **union with Christ**. He distinguishes punitive caricatures from covenantal **judgment-as-salvation**, contending that wrath is the name for divine love’s opposition to evil. With **N. T. Wright**, he underscores the exodus-shaped narrative of **forgiveness and liberation**, yet insists with **Packer** on the juridical depth of the cross as the fulfillment of the **law-covenant** in Israel’s story.

#### 5. Epistemic humility and critical realism
In **Perhaps** 2021, McNall addresses theological knowing amid contestation, advocating **epistemic humility** within a **critical realist** framework. He argues that Christian knowing is referentially true but fallible, shaped by **virtue epistemology** that prizes courage, patience, and charity as habits conducive to truth. The key burden is to resist both triumphalist certainty and corrosive skepticism by inhabiting the virtues that fit the **gospel’s cruciform logic**. This approach neither abandons **doctrinal authority** nor absolutizes disputed models, but invites chastened confidence in the **self-revealing God** who speaks in Scripture and supremely in Jesus Christ.

McNall’s epistemic posture bears pastoral intent for a polarized **evangelical** world. Humility is not relativism but the creaturely correlate of **faith seeking understanding**, a retrieval of the monastic-scholastic habitus in a late-modern key. The same humility that keeps the **mosaic of atonement** non-reductive also keeps theological discourse hospitable, fostering communities capable of discerning **orthodoxy** without rage. As in his atonement synthesis, the epistemology is both integrative and cruciform, uniting **truth** and **love** as converging goods of sanctified reason.

#### 6. Scripture, narrative, and ecclesial formation
McNall’s **Long Story Short** 2018 distills the canonical plotline to present the **gospel** as the climax of God’s purposes for creation and Israel. The narrative arc provides the scaffolding on which the **mosaic of atonement** hangs, ensuring that doctrinal terms like **substitution**, **sacrifice**, and **victory** are exegetically located in the drama of covenant and new creation. He presses for a pedagogy that trains the church in **biblical literacy**, connecting **dogmatics** to catechesis so that soteriology animates practices of worship, mission, and justice.

This narrative orientation shapes his ecclesial vision of **holiness** in a Wesleyan idiom. The cross is not merely the site of legal transfer but the doorway into **participation** in Christ’s resurrected life, effecting transformation by the Spirit in the communion of saints. Here the language of **theosis** serves as shorthand for evangelical sanctification without collapsing Creator and creature. The church is formed as a **cruciform community**, delivered from the powers, justified by **grace**, and conformed to Christ, embodying the integrative logic of the **mosaic** in its worship and witness.

#### 7. Atonement for ordinary people and pastoral apologetics
With **How Jesus Saves** 2023, McNall translates the academic thesis of **The Mosaic of Atonement** into lay-accessible prose. He retains the fourfold weave of **recapitulation**, **sacrifice**, **victory**, and **substitution**, foregrounding **union with Christ** as the thread that ties them together. The tone is apologetic in the best sense, meant to address the sincere questions of those troubled by the cross or confused by competing models. He offers clarifications on **wrath and love**, **justice and mercy**, and the meaning of **representative headship**, inviting readers to see the cross as God’s self-giving triumph rather than divine sadism.

This pastoral turn does not dilute doctrinal content. Instead, it displays McNall’s conviction that clear **dogmatics** is an ally of evangelism and discipleship. The **mosaic** becomes a catechetical tool, an ordered plurality that can be taught, memorized, and prayed. Appeals to **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, and **Anselm** are woven alongside modern witnesses like **Rutledge** and **Wright**, showing ordinary Christians that the church’s tradition is not a dusty museum but a treasury for understanding **salvation** today.

#### 8. Doctrinal profile and Reformed evaluation
Taken together, McNall’s work yields a doctrinal profile marked by **union with Christ** as a structuring principle, a high view of **Scripture** read through the canon’s **narrative unity**, and an integrative account of **atonement** that refuses zero-sum contests among **substitution**, **victory**, **sacrifice**, and **recapitulation**. His **epistemic humility** is ordered to confession, not away from it, and his **Wesleyan** sympathies surface in a hopeful emphasis on **holiness** and sanctified participation. The result is a theologically generous evangelicalism that retrieves **catholic** breadth without sacrificing **Reformation** depth. He offers a model of constructive theology that is historically alert, biblically tethered, and pastorally useful.

From a **Reformed/WTS evaluation**, several convergences and tensions appear. Reformed theology can warmly affirm McNall’s canonical emphasis, his dogged defense of **penal substitution** within **union with Christ**, and his insistence that juridical and liberative motifs are mutually implicating. Yet there are cautions. First, the non-hierarchical integration of the **mosaic** risks obscuring the principial role of **federal headship** and the forensic grace of **imputation** in classical covenant theology where **law-gospel** relations and the **covenant of works and grace** structure soteriology. A Reformed proposal would prioritize **substitution** as the logical engine, with **victory** and **recapitulation** radiating from that forensic center. Second, McNall’s **epistemic fallibilism** and **critical realism** are salutary against triumphalism, but a WTS approach would frame humility under the **self-attesting Word**, **sensus divinitatis**, and **Spirit-wrought certainty**, so that **Scripture** as principium claims not merely probable but covenantally authoritative knowledge. Third, Wesleyan accounts of **prevenient grace** and synergistic overtones in **theosis** can blur the monergistic clarity of **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace**; a Reformed alternative would stress the Spirit’s unilateral vivification that grounds participation in the prior gift of justification. Even so, McNall’s constructive center of **union with Christ**, his retrieval across the ages, and his pastoral clarity make him a fruitful interlocutor for Reformed dogmatics, inviting a covenantally ordered mosaic in which **penal substitution** enjoys primacy without silencing the choir of biblical images.
