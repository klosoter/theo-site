### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Jonathan Leeman emerged as a leading Baptist ecclesiologist within the **9Marks** renewal effort that took shape in the late 1990s under **Mark Dever**, pressing for **regenerate church membership**, **discipline**, and **expository preaching** against the backdrop of pragmatic evangelicalism. Trained in political theory and theology, with study at the **London School of Economics**, **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary**, and doctoral work in political theology, he brings together **political philosophy** and **biblical theology** to recalibrate Baptist polity. As editorial director at **9Marks** and an elder at **Cheverly Baptist Church** in Maryland, he writes as both scholar and pastor. His method is shaped by **Augustinian** realism and a conviction that the church is an actual **institution** with Christ-given **jurisdiction**, not merely a voluntary association of religious consumers. The guiding question is how Christ’s **regnum Christi** becomes visible in a local assembly through the **keys of the kingdom**, *potestas clavium*, and what this means for membership, discipline, and public witness.

Leeman’s epistemic stance resists both secular **liberal neutrality** and ecclesial **anti-institutionalism**. He retrieves a canonical, covenantal account of **authority**, arguing that the church’s authority is representative, ministerial, and declarative, never legislative. Scripture authorizes the church to say who is and is not part of the **new covenant** community and to mark off the church-world boundary through **baptism**, the **Lord’s Supper**, and **discipline**. The hermeneutical nerve center is **Matthew 16 and 18** with their language of **binding and loosing**, read alongside **1 Corinthians 5** and **2 Corinthians 2**, where the congregation pronounces judgment, excludes the unrepentant, and later reaffirms forgiveness. In method Leeman combines **systematic theology**, **exegetical theology**, and **political theology** in order to answer ecclesiological questions that are both doctrinal and juridical.

#### 2. Early program: love, membership, and discipline
Leeman’s 2010 monograph, **The Church and the Surprising Offense of God’s Love**, provided an initial manifesto: **love** is not sentimental inclusivity but covenantal commitment to **holiness**, so the enactments of love include the hard goods of **membership** and **discipline**. The argument reframes the evangelical debate, insisting that the moral shape of **agape** is given by the gospel’s holy form and that churches must institutionalize love. This means that the ordinances function as more than devotional symbols; they are **juridical signs** that constitute the boundary of the **visible church**. Here Leeman retrieves **covenant** as a legal-moral category, drawing on **biblical theology** to show how the new covenant creates a people under Christ’s **lordship** whose borders must be publicly recognized through **baptism** and **the Supper**.

The companion volumes, **Church Membership** and **Church Discipline** (both 2012), translate the thesis into pastoral practice. **Church Membership** argues that membership is a church’s public affirmation of a person’s gospel profession and way of life, an authorization to represent **Jesus’ name** in the world as part of his body and embassy. **Church Discipline** locates formal warning and excommunication within the same logic: the church withdraws its affirmation of a member’s profession when unrepentance contradicts the gospel. The **keys of the kingdom** belong to the gathered congregation, which possesses the authority to render these judgments, while **elders** lead in teaching and proposing. Together these books press the point that love’s institutional form is necessary to display the gospel’s **holiness** and **truth**.

#### 3. Institutional account: embassy and the keys
The constructive backbone appears in **Political Church: The Local Assembly as Embassy of Christ’s Rule** (2016). Here Leeman argues that the church is essentially **political**, not because it seizes the levers of the nation-state, but because it is the earthly outpost of Christ’s **kingdom**, an **embassy** that speaks officially for the King. The central categories are **authority**, **jurisdiction**, and **representation**. The church’s authority is instituted by Christ, its jurisdiction is spiritual and covenantal, and its representation is declarative, meaning that the church renders public judgments about the who and the what of the gospel through the **keys**. This is not arbitrary power but a ministerial stewardship bounded by Scripture. Leeman appropriates **Oliver O’Donovan’s** account of authority as the authorization to act and pronounce within a moral order, while rejecting liberal privatization that relegates religion to the inner life. The church’s politicalness is sui generis: it is the **polis** of the age to come made visible by **Word** and **ordinance**, not a competitor to the state.

Leeman’s ecclesiological architecture distinguishes between the church’s **institutional acts** and the Christian’s **individual vocation**. In Matthew 18 the congregation convenes as an institution to judge matters touching the gospel’s confession. In **1 Corinthians 5**, **Paul** commands the church to assemble and enact a corporate judgment that removes the immoral brother. The **Lord’s Supper** is construed as a repeated public reaffirmation of each member’s citizenship, a covenantal oath-sign that marks the boundary of the community. This thick institutionalism intentionally counters Protestant tendencies to collapse ecclesiology into **soteriology**, insisting instead that salvation creates a visible body with real **jurisdiction** whose acts have eschatological weight.

#### 4. Congregational authority and elder leadership
In **Don’t Fire Your Church Members: The Case for Congregationalism** (2016) and the brief primer **Understanding the Congregation’s Authority** (2016), Leeman argues for **elder-led congregationalism** as the polity that best corresponds to the biblical **keys of the kingdom**. The congregation holds final authority over confessional and membership judgments. **Elders** possess teaching and oversight authority but are not the key-bearers. Votes are not mere preferences but juridical **verdicts** that bind and loose on earth what heaven has decreed through the gospel. The book’s provocative title points to a Baptist abuse that treats members as mere customers liable to be fired; Leeman instead contends that members are the corporate steward of Christ’s name.

This polity is framed within **covenantal** obligations. Membership is a web of promises between members and leaders under Christ’s **lordship**. **Plurality of elders**, careful admission processes, restorative **discipline**, and congregational responsibility for doctrine and membership together seek to protect the **holiness** and **unity** of the church. At every point Leeman insists on **representative authority**: leaders and members alike possess only what **Christ** gives through **Scripture**, and therefore must speak where the Bible speaks and remain silent where it is silent.

#### 5. Public theology: the church amid the nations
Leeman’s **How the Nations Rage: Rethinking Faith and Politics in a Divided Age** (2018) extends his ecclesiology into public theology. Rejecting both quietist withdrawal and partisan captivity, he contends that the local church’s **embassy** identity should discipline Christian political engagement. Allegiance to **Christ’s kingdom** reorders all other loyalties, freeing Christians to act justly while refusing idolatrous hopes. Leeman affirms **religious liberty** as a matter of justice and prudence in a fallen world of overlapping jurisdictions, while warning against **liberalism’s** myth of neutrality. The state bears limited **authority** to secure justice and order, the family bears **authority** over its proper domain, and the church bears **authority** over the proclamation and boundary of the gospel; confusing these jurisdictions breeds coercion and compromise.

Drawing on **Augustine**, **Hauerwas**, **Kuyper**, and **O’Donovan**, Leeman critiques both right and left political theologies that instrumentalize the church. He leans toward a chastened **two-ages** account rather than a strict **two kingdoms** dualism, emphasizing that the church’s most political act is the weekly gathering where **Word** and **Table** proclaim the reign of Christ. The call is to pursue public justice without collapsing the **embassy** into an interest group or civil religion.

#### 6. A theology of authority and safeguarding
With **Authority: How Godly Rule Protects the Vulnerable, Strengthens Communities, and Promotes Human Flourishing** (2023), Leeman offers a more general theology of **authority** that spans church, family, and state. He defines authority as the morally right authorizing to direct others for their good within a God-given **jurisdiction**. Authority is a good of creation and redemption, patterned by the **cross** and constrained by **law** and **accountability**. He therefore combats contemporary suspicion of authority, while attending to the real specter of **abuse**. The answers are not anti-institutional but reformational: **plurality**, **transparency**, **discipline** for leaders, and clear **process** that binds leaders and members to truth.

This volume consolidates themes spread across his earlier works: authority is **representative** not **original**; it is **ministerial** not **magisterial**; and its ends are the protection of the weak and the promotion of the common good. Leeman reasserts that institutions with defined **offices**, **procedures**, and **bounded power** make love concrete and durable. Theologically, he connects this to the **triune economy** where the Son receives and exercises authority from the Father, and to the church’s stewardship of **Christ’s keys** as the enactment of the gospel’s holy order.

#### 7. Doctrinal synthesis: keys, ordinances, covenant, and mission
Across his corpus, Leeman’s doctrinal center is the **keys of the kingdom** and their exercise in the **ordinances**. Baptism is the initiatory sign that marks off the church’s border by publicly naming a person as a representative of **Christ**. The **Lord’s Supper** is the continual declaration of that membership, a corporate oath-sign that reaffirms the confession. **Church discipline** is the tragic but necessary withdrawal of that recognition when a profession is contradicted by unrepentant life. These are not merely private pieties but institutional acts through which the **embassy of heaven** speaks in Christ’s name. The result is a church that knows who is inside and outside, not in a triumphalist spirit but in humble obedience to **Scripture**.

Leeman refracts soteriology through ecclesiology without collapsing the two. The gospel creates a **covenantal people**, and therefore the church’s **mission** is not simply to make converts but to make baptized, teaching-obedient disciples who bear the name of **Father, Son, and Spirit**. The **Word** reverberates outward through preaching, membership, and discipline, and thereby the church manifests the ethical shape of the **new creation**. Inter-church cooperation remains important but is always derivative of the local assembly’s **jurisdiction**. In sum, the core conceptual tools are **jurisdiction**, **representation**, **covenant**, and **ordinance** as the instituted means by which Christ publicly governs his people.

#### 8. Interlocutors and contrasts: O’Donovan, Hauerwas, Kuyper, and two kingdoms
Leeman’s constructive project stands in conversation with **Oliver O’Donovan** on authority and resurrection, from whom he appropriates the grammar of **authorization** and **judgment** while situating it more explicitly within congregational **polity**. He appreciates **Stanley Hauerwas’s** church-as-polis emphasis yet worries that virtue-ethics ecclesiology neglects **institutional authority** and **juridical acts**. He benefits from **Abraham Kuyper’s** **sphere sovereignty**, though he modifies it by locating the church’s unique **jurisdiction** specifically in the **keys** and the **ordinances** rather than broad cultural mandate claims. With **David VanDrunen** and contemporary **two kingdoms** theologians he shares a concern to distinguish church and civil authority, but he resists a rigid dualism that privatizes the church or secures public norms chiefly by **natural law** without robustly institutionalizing the church’s counter-polity.

Exegetically, Leeman contends against evangelical ecclesiologies that treat **Matthew 18** as a pastoral suggestion rather than a constitutional charter. He challenges elder-rule models that concentrate the **keys** in office-bearers rather than the congregation, appealing to **1 Corinthians 5** as evidence that the church assembled bears final responsibility. Against sacramental minimalism he grants the **ordinances** real juridical significance, while maintaining Baptist convictions about **believers’ baptism** and **regenerate membership**. The polemical edge remains pastoral, as his aim is to equip ordinary congregations to exercise Christ’s **authority** in love.

#### 9. Pastoral prudence and contemporary tests
Leeman’s ministry unfolded amid test cases that exposed the fault-lines of evangelical **ecclesiology** and **political theology**. Disputes over **religious liberty**, public-health mandates, and the church’s gathering sharpened his emphasis on **jurisdiction**, with the claim that the state bears authority over civil order, while Christ alone authorizes the church’s **worship** and **ordinances**. He has counseled a posture of respectful compliance within the limits of **conscience** and **Scripture**, coupled with clarity about the church’s independence in matters pertaining to its **embassy** identity. In partisan tumult he urges pastors to prioritize **catechesis**, **church discipline**, and the **Lord’s Day** as the central political work of the church, while encouraging Christians to engage prudently in the public square without transferring messianic expectations to the state.

The prudential counsel is anchored in **Augustinian** patience and a theology of the **cross** that normalizes weakness and suffering. The church’s authority is exercised most powerfully in **preaching**, **prayer**, and the **ordinances**, not through coercion. This pastoral realism insists that guarding the table and the membership roll is not a parochial concern but the means by which the church preserves the integrity of its **witness** before the nations.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** perspective, Leeman’s Baptist ecclesiology is a bracing ally and a principled foil. His retrieval of **institutional authority**, **marks of the church** in **Word** and **discipline**, and an **Augustinian** account of political humility commends itself to **Presbyterian** concerns about Christ’s **regnum mediatorium** in history. His critique of **liberal neutrality**, insistence that authority is **ministerial**, and refusal to instrumentalize the church comport with Reformed emphases on **Scripture’s sufficiency** and the spirituality of the church. Yet tensions remain: first, on the seat of the **keys**, Leeman’s **congregationalism** assigns final jurisdiction to the gathered membership, whereas **Westminster** assigns church power to the **courts of elders**. A Reformed alternative would locate binding and loosing in graded **presbyteries** and **sessions**, safeguarding catholicity by inter-church discipline. Second, on the **sacraments** as means of grace, the Reformed tradition would press beyond juridical recognition to a stronger account of sacramental efficacy within **covenant**, while welcoming Leeman’s emphasis on their boundary-marking function. Third, on **two kingdoms**, a **WTS** evaluation influenced by **Van Til** and wary of strong natural-law appeals will resonate with Leeman’s anti-neutral stance, yet may prefer a more explicit articulation of Christ’s **lordship** over all vocations alongside a sharper distinction between common and holy. Finally, on **magistracy**, **Westminster 23** envisions a nursing-father role for civil rulers that Leeman’s disestablishmentarian **religious liberty** posture recasts in strictly protective terms; the Reformed alternative would nuance this toward a positive but limited duty to uphold true religion without ecclesial usurpation. In sum, Leeman offers a richly biblical, ecclesially serious, and pastorally seasoned account that challenges Reformed churches to recover **discipline** and **jurisdiction**, even as Reformed polity provides a different institutional home for his best insights.
