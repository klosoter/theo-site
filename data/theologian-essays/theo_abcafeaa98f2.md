### ESSAY
#### 1. Context, formation, and method
Craig D. Allert stands at the intersection of **Evangelical bibliology** and **patristic studies**, arguing that the **New Testament canon** emerged within and for the church under the guidance of the **regula fidei**. His career in the North American and Canadian Evangelical academy, notably at **Trinity Western University**, unfolds against late twentieth-century debates over **inerrancy** following the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978, and ongoing disputes over the historical process of **canon formation**. In this context, Allert presses Evangelicals to trade a thin **proof-texted biblicism** for an ecclesially thick account of **Scripture**, **tradition**, and **interpretation** shaped by the **fathers**. The resulting thesis is that **sola scriptura** must be distinguished from **solo scriptura**, because the former presupposes a **Spirit-led church** and the latter isolates the text from the **people, practices, and creed** that normed its reception.

Allert’s method is explicitly **historical-theological** and **hermeneutical**, retrieving the **patristic canon consciousness** and showing how **apostolicity**, **orthodoxy**, and **catholicity** functioned as criteria within a living **traditio apostolica**. He does not propose a rival authority to **Scripture** but describes the indispensable role of the **rule of faith** in mediating the **sense of Scripture** and the recognition of **which writings** counted as Scripture. In this, Allert aligns with the spirit of **ressourcement** while resisting Romantic idealizations of antiquity, calling for critical appropriation of **Irenaeus**, **Tertullian**, **Origen**, **Basil**, and **Augustine**. The keywords of his project are **canon**, **regula fidei**, **ecclesial hermeneutics**, and **literal sense** in its ancient usage, all ordered to a constructive account of **authority** that maintains the primacy of **Scripture** within the church.

#### 2. Early study in Justin Martyr and the shape of patristic authority
Allert’s monograph **Revelation, Truth, Canon, and Interpretation** in 2002 situated **Justin Martyr’s Dialogue with Trypho** within a matrix of **revelation** and **scriptural truth** that was neither purely philosophical nor narrowly proof-textual. He reads **Justin** as dramatizing a Christological **rule of faith** through which the **Scriptures of Israel** are confessed as the **Old Testament**, leading to a normative pattern of **typology** and **prophetic fulfillment**. For Allert, this early second-century voice already displays a double conviction about **canon**. The church did not yet possess a fixed **list**, yet it possessed a fixed **rule**, a **kerygmatic summary** of the **apostolic gospel** that constrained and enabled interpretation. This analysis exhibits the signature Allert move: anchoring **canon** in the interplay of **Christology**, **ecclesial confession**, and **liturgical use**.

The focus on **Justin Martyr** thus becomes a template for Allert’s subsequent work on **authority**. He argues that **canon consciousness** precedes **canon closure**, and that the criterion of **orthodoxy** is not an extraneous imposition but the church’s recognition of **apostolic truth** under the guidance of the **Holy Spirit**. The logic of **apostolicity** is not simply a chain-of-hands transmission but the living rule that secures the **Christological unity** of **Scripture**. This provides Allert with a historically grounded way to critique modern **Evangelical biblicism**, which often presumes a flat equivalence of **inspiration** with **canonicity** apart from the church’s **creedal grammar**.

#### 3. A High View of Scripture and the ecclesial formation of canon
Allert’s best-known work, **A High View of Scripture?** in 2007, addresses the Evangelical claim that fidelity to **biblical authority** requires a strictly non-ecclesial account of **canon**. He contends that the actual historical process included debate and discernment visible in **Eusebius’s** fourth-century categories of **homologoumena**, **antilegomena**, and **notha**, the emergence of proto-canonical lists such as the **Muratorian Fragment**, and the watershed of **Athanasius’s Festal Letter** in 367 that names the twenty-seven books of the **New Testament**. Against the tidy narrative that **canonicity** was a purely self-evident property recognized instantly by isolated readers, Allert shows the public, communal, and prolonged nature of the church’s recognition of **apostolic Scriptures**.

The practical upshot of **A High View of Scripture?** is twofold. First, Allert differentiates **inspiration** and **canon**, noting that the divine act of **theopneustos** did not automatically produce an explicit list. Second, he argues that criteria such as **apostolicity**, **orthodoxy**, and **catholicity** were not arbitrary power moves but aspects of the **regula fidei** that secured unity of doctrine and worship. In conversation with **F. F. Bruce**, **Bruce Metzger**, and **Lee Martin McDonald**, and in implicit friction with **Michael J. Kruger’s** later model of a **self-authenticating canon**, Allert insists that the **church’s role** is not constitutive in the sense of creative sovereignty, yet it is constitutive of the **context** within which **Scripture’s authority** was recognized and canonically stabilized. The **Spirit**, the **rule**, and the **church** are integral, not optional, to the evangelical claim of **biblical authority**.

#### 4. Sola Scriptura, not solo scriptura
A recurring distinction in Allert’s work is the opposition between **sola scriptura** properly understood and **solo scriptura** as an anachronistic individualism. The former names **Scripture’s primacy** as the norm that norms and is not normed, subordinating **tradition** as a ministerial authority. The latter evacuates the **regula fidei**, the **creeds**, and the **liturgical canon** from hermeneutics, rendering **interpretation** prey to private imagination or to the tyranny of the latest method. Allert appeals to **Augustine’s** frank acknowledgment of the church’s role in moving him to believe the **Gospel**, not to elevate **ecclesial authority** above the **Word**, but to register the concrete economy by which the **Spirit** binds **Scripture** and **church** in the life of **faith**.

This distinction equips Allert to challenge **Evangelical inerrantism** at its weakest points without denying **Scripture’s authority**. When assertions of **inerrancy** become a priori invocations that control exegesis rather than descriptions accountable to the canonical form of the text, the **doctrine of Scripture** is reduced to a defensive slogan. Allert’s counterproposal is to embed **inspiration**, **trustworthiness**, and **clarity** in a practiced **canonical reading** under the **rule of faith**. This is not a downgrade but an upgrade of **biblical authority**, because it situates the **truthfulness of Scripture** within the saving economy where **Christ**, **Spirit**, and **church** are inseparably ordered.

#### 5. Patristic exegesis and the literal sense of Genesis One
In **Early Christian Readings of Genesis One** in 2018, Allert turns to a test case that exposes modern **hermeneutical assumptions**. He argues that the **patristic literal sense** meant reading *ad litteram* in context and according to the nature of the discourse, not a wooden **literalism** that flattens genre. He shows how **Basil of Caesarea’s** Homilies on the **Hexaemeron**, **Origen’s** homilies and commentaries, and **Augustine’s** **De Genesi ad litteram** display both confidence in the **truth of Scripture** and sophisticated awareness of **figurative**, **allegorical**, and **anagogical** dimensions. The patristic lexicon of **theoria** and **typos** stands against the false dilemma that one must choose between **literal truthfulness** and **spiritual interpretation**.

The argument about **Genesis One** thus becomes a window into Allert’s broader claim about **evangelical hermeneutics**. Modern disputes, especially around **young-earth creationism**, often impose a single mode of **literalism** as the only faithful posture toward **Scripture**. Allert demonstrates that **orthodox Fathers** read the text differently while defending its **authority**. This renders **allegory** and **typology** not evasions but disciplined ways of confessing the **Christological unity** of **Scripture**. In short, the church’s earliest readers achieved what many Evangelicals desire, namely confidence in **Scripture’s truth** combined with genre-sensitive **exegesis**, precisely because they read within the **regula fidei**.

#### 6. Retrieval without romanticism and the shape of tradition
Allert’s retrieval of **tradition** is never naive. He acknowledges the diversity among **Irenaeus**, **Tertullian**, **Origen**, and **Augustine** on matters of **allegory**, **literal sense**, and even **canon consciousness**. In dialogue with **D. H. Williams** on Evangelicals and **tradition**, Allert portrays **traditio apostolica** as a habitus formed by **catechesis**, **baptismal confession**, and **Eucharistic** practice, rather than a vault of oracular propositions. The **rule of faith** functions as a hermeneutical horizon, not a substitute for **exegesis**, aligning doctrine and doxology. This protects **Evangelical theology** from two opposite errors, namely the flattening of **tradition** into a proof-texted comment on **Scripture**, and the inflation of **tradition** into a magisterial rival to **Scripture**.

This nuanced account guards Allert from the charge of **traditionalism**. His aim is to render **Evangelical theology** more, not less, responsive to **Scripture** by knitting together what the early church never ripped apart. The church’s **canon lists**, its rehearsal of the **creeds**, and the **liturgical reading** of the **Gospels** formed a common Christian imagination in which **Scripture** could be heard rightly. The governance of **orthodoxy** by the **rule of faith** oriented interpretation toward **Christ**, protected the **Trinity**, and warded off **Marcionite** and **Gnostic** reductions. Allert’s retrieval of this grammar implies that fidelity to **Scripture** is most plausible within an ecclesially thick **Evangelicalism**.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and Evangelical recalibration
Throughout his work Allert engages major voices in **canon studies**. With **F. F. Bruce** he shares the conviction that the church recognized rather than created **canon**, but he contends that Bruce under-describes the role of **the rule of faith** and **liturgical use**. With **Bruce Metzger** and **Lee Martin McDonald**, he stresses the prolonged and complex process of **canon stabilization**. In dialogue, sometimes explicit and sometimes tacit, with **Michael J. Kruger**, he appreciates the insistence on **Scripture’s self-authentication** while cautioning against isolating this claim from the **ecclesial context** by which that self-authentication becomes publicly operative. These engagements reposition **Evangelical bibliology** toward a chastened, historically responsible **high view of Scripture** that is congruent with **patristic practice**.

The pedagogical reach of Allert’s books has been significant in **seminary classrooms** and **Evangelical colleges**, where students formed by **inerrancy debates** and **creation controversies** find in Allert a constructive pathway. His account reframes **authority** around **canon within the rule**, **hermeneutics within tradition**, and **exegesis within worship**. By integrating **historical theology** with **doctrine of Scripture**, Allert gifts the Evangelical guild with a model of **scholarly retrieval** that prevents both academic historicism and ecclesial amnesia. The result is a recalibrated **Evangelical confidence** that listens to **the fathers** without abandoning Protestant commitments to **sola scriptura**.

#### 8. Doctrinal payoffs and evangelical ecclesiology
The doctrinal implications of Allert’s work stretch beyond **canon** to **ecclesiology** and **theological method**. If **canon consciousness** arises within **regula fidei**, then the **church’s confession** is not an optional afterthought to **Scripture** but the God-given instrument of its right reception. This implies that **catechesis**, **creedal formation**, and **liturgical reading** are integral to **Evangelical theology**, not merely historical curiosities. By urging **Evangelicals** to receive **Scripture** with the **church**, Allert presses toward a thicker **catholicity**, a shared currency of doctrine, prayer, and reading that spans centuries. The payoff includes a more robust practice of **theological exegesis**, a charitable posture toward intra-evangelical differences over **Genesis One**, and a re-centering of **Christology** and the **Trinity** in hermeneutics.

In Allert’s hands **inspiration** and **inerrancy** are located within the wider doctrine of **providence** and **sanctification** of the church’s reading. He neither dilutes **inerrancy** into vague trust nor weaponizes it against historical study. His accent falls on **Scripture’s truthfulness** in accomplishing its divine ends and on the **Spirit’s guidance** in forming a people capable of saying Amen to **God’s Word**. This is the deepest point of contact between his retrieval of the **rule of faith** and a reformed **Evangelical spirituality** that prizes both **Word** and **Spirit** in the life of the **church**.

#### 9. Limits, risks, and constructive tensions
No retrieval is without risks, and Allert acknowledges the limits of **patristic exegesis** for modern questions. The fathers did not always share modern historical-critical sensibilities, and their use of **allegory** can over-extend the text’s textual horizons. Allert’s approach steers between anachronistic **literalism** and uncontrolled **allegoresis** by privileging the **rule of faith** as a doctrinal brake. Yet questions remain about how **Evangelicals** should negotiate the authority of later **creeds** and the status of **post-apostolic tradition** when disagreements arise. Allert’s answer is an ecclesiology of **discernment**, where **Scripture** judges **tradition** even as **tradition** guides readers to hear **Scripture**. The tension is neither resolved nor evaded, but held in a practical theology of **reception**.

At the level of canon theory, critics aligned with a more stringent **self-authenticating** model argue that Allert’s emphasis on the **church’s role** risks sliding into a **tradition-constituted** canon. Allert counters that the **Spirit’s work** is not a private illumination detached from the **church’s public life**, and that the concrete history of fourth-century **canon lists** and disputes over **Hebrews**, **James**, **2 Peter**, and **Revelation** illustrates how **recognition** actually occurred. The canon is self-authenticating in virtue of the **divine voice**, but that voice was heard and confessed by the **people of God** through the **rule of faith**. The outcome is a view of **biblical authority** inseparably ecclesial and irreducibly divine.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** perspective, Allert’s retrieval of the **regula fidei** and his critique of **solo scriptura** are salutary correctives to individualistic **Evangelical biblicism**. His historical account of **canon formation** is a needed reminder that the **autopistia Scripturae**, the self-witness of **Scripture**, ordinarily reaches the believer through the public ministry of the **church**. Yet tensions appear where his emphasis on **ecclesial mediation** threatens to blur the Reformed distinction between the **norma normans non normata** of **Scripture** and the **norma normata** of **tradition**. A Westminster alternative presses the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** more explicitly, locating **canon recognition** primarily in the Spirit’s immediate witness by and with the **Word**, with **tradition** honored as ministerial rather than constitutive. On **inerrancy**, Westminster theology would align Allert’s concern for canonical form with a robust affirmation of **verbal plenary inspiration**, insisting that the **literal sense** as grammatical-historical includes figural **typology** without licensing allegorical surplus beyond textual warrant. With these calibrations, Reformed orthodoxy can appropriate Allert’s central insight that **Scripture**, **church**, and **rule of faith** belong together in the economy of **revelation**, while maintaining that **Scripture alone** remains the ultimate judge of **tradition**, **creed**, and **practice**.
