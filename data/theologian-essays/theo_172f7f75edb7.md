### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the turn to Catholic grammar
Born in 1955 in England, **Paul J. Griffiths** matured intellectually within late modern debates over the study of religion and the identities of theological disciplines in the American university. Trained first as a scholar of **Buddhist thought** and classical Indian philosophy, he mastered **Sanskrit** and historical traditions of **Buddhahood** long before his public identification with **Roman Catholic theology** in the mid 1990s. That two-stage formation produced his signature doubleness: an acute awareness of **comparative method** and the limits of the **religious studies guild**, joined to an increasingly rigorous commitment to **Augustinian** and **Thomistic** accounts of intellect, desire, and speech under the **magisterium**. His appointments at institutions like the **University of Illinois at Chicago**, **Notre Dame**, and **Duke Divinity School** placed him at the front lines of disputes about the place of **confessional theology** within pluralist academies. The result is a theologian who refuses both liberal **irenics** and polemical **sectarianism**, arguing instead for a cultivated **doctrinal grammar** capable of real adjudication among rival accounts of God, world, and salvation.

Griffiths’s method crystallized as a deliberately **Augustinian** posture: to theologize as part of the **Church’s speech**, to read with and for the **ecclesia**, and to understand theological sentences by their role in the **ordo caritatis**, the order of love. Against a standing ideal of academic neutrality, he defends **fides quaerens intellectum** in a way that makes fruitful conflict possible. Theology is not the collating of data about religious phenomena; it is the **regimen of Christian locutions**, a training in what may be said truthfully of **God**, **creation**, and **last things**. The discipline of **intellectus** is thus indexed to the virtues, especially **studiositas** as rightly ordered desire to know, and opposed to **curiositas**, the vice of acquisitive and disordered inquiry. That map of virtues, drawn from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, grounds his critiques of the modern information economy and his reconstrual of the theologian’s vocation under **episcopal oversight**.

#### 2. From comparative religion to apologetics by grammar
Griffiths’s early monographs in non-Christian traditions serve as prolegomena to his theology. In **On Being Buddha: The Classical Doctrine of Buddhahood** 1994, he shows how precise **doctrinal description** can generate internal measures of coherence and truth within a tradition. He refuses reductive sociologies of religion and insists on reading authoritative **texts** with the **interpretive habits** they demand. That descriptive discipline leads into **An Apology for Apologetics** 1991 and **Problems of Religious Diversity** 2001, where he argues that real interreligious engagement requires **disputation**, **testimony**, and **conversion-shaped speech**, not the procedural neutrality cherished by the mainstream **religious studies guild**. The claim is not that Christians have a monopoly on rationality, but that **reasoning is traditioned**, and that Christians may and should argue from within **creedal commitments** toward their interlocutors. In these works he tests **Augustine’s** confidence that love orders knowledge against the skeptical settlement of late modern pluralism, commending an irenic but unembarrassed **apologetic** practice.

This apologetic program stands on a grammar of ecclesial speech, drawn later with maximum clarity in **The Practice of Catholic Theology: A Modest Proposal** 2016. There Griffiths stipulates that **Catholic theology** is governed by **magisterial judgments** and rendered accountable to **bishop and creed**. Theologians serve the **Church’s liturgical and catechetical life**, and their manner of speech is rule-bound. Such rules do not stifle thought; they delimit the field of truth so that theological **adjudication** remains possible. The alternative is what he calls the **serpentine drift** of free inquiry, governed by the vice of **curiositas**, the drive to own and display novelty. This line of argument situates him within contemporary debates about **theological authority**, while intentionally polarizing his distance from **liberal Catholic modernism** and its free-floating method.

#### 3. Reading as an ascetical practice
Central to Griffiths’s project is the claim that reading is a **religious practice** shaped by the content of the **Gospel** and the communal habits of **tradition**. In **Religious Reading: The Place of Reading in the Practice of Religion** 1999, he recounts the regimes of **medieval lectio**, **memorization**, and **chant**, and contrasts those with modern habits of skimming, indexing, and consumption in the **information economy**. Premodern reading was governed by **authority**, **canonical order**, and **ascetical repetition**, because its object was the **formation of the reader** into the text’s world. The modern practice aims at extraction, accumulation, and display of information, animated by **curiositas**. Following **Augustine’s De doctrina christiana**, he contends that to read **Scripture** and **doctrine** truthfully is to join an **interpretive community** that binds the reader’s desires, regulates inference, and secures a share in the **Church’s memoria**. This theme of **traditioned reading** becomes a site where his concerns with virtue, authority, and knowledge converge.

Griffiths extends this to pedagogy, arguing that the classroom must be ordered by **studiositas**, with practices of **slow reading**, **memorized recitation**, and **catechetical sequencing**. The aim is not to reproduce the past but to fit the mind for its object by **habituated attention**. The habitus of **Christian reading** then underwrites his wider insistence that theology is a **rule-governed speech-act** within the **communio**. His account refuses the liberal thesis that reading is a merely private cognitive event; it is a **public ecclesial discipline**, underwritten by sacraments, creed, and the **magisterium**.

#### 4. The moral psychology of knowing and speaking
The ethics of knowledge receives its classic articulation in **Intellectual Appetite: A Theological Grammar** 2009. Drawing on **Aquinas’s** analysis of the appetitus and **Augustine’s** diagnosis of disordered loves, Griffiths sets **studiositas** over against **curiositas** as the hinge of intellectual holiness. **Curiositas** is acquisitive, promiscuous in its objects, and oriented toward domination and display. **Studiositas** receives, orders, and delights in the object for its own sake and for **God’s**. This is no mere advice to students. It is a metaphysical claim about the mind’s relation to **truth** and a political claim about the university’s economy of prestige. The book develops a taxonomy of intellectual vices and virtues, tunes them to **Catholic liturgy and doctrine**, and proposes a disciplinary conversion of scholarly habits that resists both **technocracy** and romantic **anti-intellectualism**.

From appetite he turns to speech in **Lying: An Augustinian Theology of Duplicity** 2004. Following **Augustine’s De mendacio**, he contends that every lie is an act against **truth** because it intentionally asserts what is not. He rebuts consequentialist exceptions that would permit falsehood to secure goods such as life or public order. The work engages **Casuistry**, **mental reservation**, and modern **speech-act theory**, aiming to retrieve a simple **Augustinian** maxim: Christians must be truthful because **God** is truthful and because truthful speech orders the **polis** toward peace. Griffiths accepts the complexity of intention and circumstance but holds the line that false assertion remains intrinsically disordered. The result is a rigorous counsel for ecclesial and academic life in which argument’s integrity depends upon **veracity**.

#### 5. Eschatology as decreation and the shape of hope
The eschatological arc of Griffiths’s thought finds its most daring expression in **Decreation: The Last Things of All Creatures** 2014. Borrowing the term **decreation** from **Simone Weil**, while re-siting it within **Catholic dogma**, he argues that the end of creatures is not an autonomous flourishing but a divinely wrought unmaking that makes room for the **beatific vision**. Creation from nothing carries within it the vocation to be returned to **God** beyond the fragile securities of time and decay. For the blessed this decreation is not annihilation but the transformation of **flesh**, memory, and desire into the immediacy of vision and love. For the damned, decreation names the definitive loss of communion’s goods, a privative descent that remains a creaturely state under **divine justice**. He affirms **resurrection**, **judgment**, **heaven**, **hell**, and **purgatory**, yet presses the reader to imagine the last things as the ending of creaturely projects and the consummation of **divine intimacy**. The provocative grammar resists sentimental progressivism and challenges immanentist eschatologies in which temporal goods are absolutized.

This eschatology connects back to reading and speech. If the end of creatures is the **vision of God**, then the ordering of **intellect and will** now must be disciplined by the words that fit us for that end. The practices of **truth-telling**, **slow reading**, and **obedient theology** are ascetical modes of dying into God, anticipations of **decreation** that loosen the hold of **curiositas** and ambition. In this way the late work harvests the earlier themes and renders them explicitly teleological. The grammar of Christian discourse is eschatological because it is ordered to **beatitude**.

#### 6. Flesh, regret, and the sacramental texture of life
In **Christian Flesh** 2018 Griffiths turns to the lived body, developing a **Catholic sacramental realism** that insists upon the irreducibly **fleshly** character of Christian existence. He probes **sexual difference**, **reproduction**, **mortality**, and **Eucharistic participation** to argue that Christian life is not a gnostic flight into disembodied spirit but a discipline of **flesh** made capable of divine intimacy. Rather than theorizing the person in abstract terms, he writes in sensuous prose about touch, taste, and the adhesives of bodily relation, all under the sign of **Christ’s flesh**. The work aims to re-enchant ordinary life by tracing how **sacrament** and **ethics** meet in creaturely matter, and it revisits themes of **desire** and **order** now specified in anatomy and kinship.

Alongside it stands **Regret: A Theology** 2018, a compact meditation on **memory**, **sin**, and **confession**. Here Griffiths asks how Christian regret can be truthful without capitulating to despair. He retrieves **Augustine’s Confessions** to articulate a practice of remembering that increases love of **God** and neighbor rather than fastening the soul to past evils. Regret becomes the affective analogue to **penance** and **absolution**, a schooling of the heart in gratitude and hope. These texts confirm the unity of his project: from epistemic virtue to speech ethics to eschatology to fleshly life, **Augustinian ordo amoris** governs the whole.

#### 7. Ecclesial location, controversy, and collaboration
Griffiths’s public career has been marked by both collaboration and controversy. His co-edited volume with **Reinhard Hütter**, **Reason and the Reasons of Faith** 2005, gathers essays that deploy **traditioned rationality** against the charge that theology cannot give reasons within the university. The collection’s wager is that **Catholic doctrine** yields a grammar for public reason that is neither sectarian withdrawal nor rationalist capitulation. At **Duke Divinity School** from 2008 to 2017 he became a prominent voice for confessional identity in a pluralist setting, defending **theological freedom under magisterial obedience**. His departure in 2017 amid conflict about the nature of institutional training and academic governance exposed the fault lines between **liberal proceduralism** and **rule-governed confession** in the guild. Through it he maintained that truthfulness, not institutional peace, is the first civic virtue of theological speech.

That conviction matches his consistent claim that theology is for **prayerful disputation** within and for the **Church**. He writes as one schooled by **Augustine’s** candor and **Aquinas’s** patience, yet impatient with drift and equivocation in the name of dialogue. Whether addressing **interreligious engagement**, **classroom praxis**, **politics of knowledge**, or **doctrinal development**, he seeks to bind speech to the **liturgical and sacramental** life of Catholicism. This is the heartbeat of his corpus: a coherent lexicon of virtues and rules whose telos is **beatific fellowship**.

#### 8. Systematic threads and a Reformed evaluation
Across the oeuvre one can trace systematic threads that secure thematic unity. First, a **doctrine of creation and decreation** that relocates anthropology under **eschatology**, refusing to construe nature as self-possessed project. Second, a **theological epistemology** in which **studiositas**, **obedience**, and **traditioned reading** are constitutive of truthful reason. Third, a **speech ethic** grounded in **divine veracity**, generating stringent norms against **lying**. Fourth, a **sacramental anthropology** that locates **flesh** within the economy of **grace** and orders erotic desire toward **charity**. The ascetical overtones are unmistakable. Theology, for Griffiths, is part of the sanctification of intellect and will, and its canons are given by **magisterial rule** and the living **traditio**.

From a **Reformed and WTS** vantage, much here is commendable and much contested. Commendable is the **Augustinian** insistence that desire orders knowledge, the retrieval of **studiositas** against corrosive **curiositas**, the re-centering of **reading** as ecclesial discipline, and the categorical refusal of **lying** in the name of expedience. These align with **sola Scriptura’s** call to sit under the Word and with classical **Reformed ethics** of speech and vocation. The friction comes where **magisterial obedience** is made formally constitutive of theology and where **nature and grace** are configured by a Catholic grammar that risks muting the **covenantal economy** of Word and Spirit. Reformed theology contends that the sufficiency and perspicuity of **Scripture**, under the ordinary **means of grace**, provide the public rules for doctrinal speech, without appeal to a living **magisterium** as norm. It also resists any eschatological language of **decreation** that might seem to imperil the robust continuity of **resurrection flesh** within the **covenant of redemption**. A Reformed alternative would welcome Griffiths’s virtues while relocating his grammar under **covenantal revelation**, deploying **confessional standards** rather than **episcopal fiat** as proximate rule, and expanding his ascetical vision through a doctrine of **Word and sacrament** governed by **Christ’s lordship** in the Church.
