### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Joachim Jeremias, born in 1900 in Dresden, matured intellectually between **Weimar turmoil**, **National Socialism**, and the reconstruction of postwar Germany, a setting that pressed questions of **history**, **truth**, and **tradition** upon New Testament hermeneutics. The son of **Alfred Jeremias**, an Assyriologist and pastor, he inherited a philological instinct and an appetite for the ancient Near Eastern world that would mark his lifelong engagement with **Second Temple Judaism** and **Aramaic** sources. Appointed in 1935 to the chair of New Testament at **Göttingen**, he led the Institute for Research on Early Christianity until retirement in 1968, training generations in historical inquiry that was deeply indebted to, yet critical of, **Formgeschichte** as practiced by **Rudolf Bultmann** and **Martin Dibelius**. His basic wager was that the **historical-critical** method, joined to close **philology** and Palestinian **archaeology**, could recover the *Sitz im Leben Jesu* over against the *Sitz im Leben der Kirche*, hence retrieving the **message of the historical Jesus** without dissolving it into kerygmatic abstraction.

More precise still, Jeremias refined a cluster of tools that became his signature: **Aramaic retroversion** of Greek sayings, scrutiny of **Semitisms** in the synoptic tradition, and controlled use of **rabbinic literature** to ground historical plausibility. He did not deny the churchly shaping of tradition, but he resisted **Bultmann's** radical skepticism by appealing to independent criteria of **authenticity**, such as linguistic coherence, **multiple attestation**, Palestinian **environmental plausibility**, and the tension-generating **criterion of dissimilarity**. He emphasized **ipsissima vox** over **ipsissima verba**, insisting that we most often possess Jesus' authentic voice rather than verbatim transcripts, a distinction that served both to acknowledge redaction and to defend the historical core of **Jesus' proclamation**. Although reliant on **Strack-Billerbeck's** compilation of rabbinic parallels, Jeremias was alert to chronological distance and strove to avoid **anachronism** by cross-checking with earlier **Tannaitic** materials and, as it emerged, **Qumran**.

Jeremias' theological orientation was decisively eschatological, but mediating between **Albert Schweitzer's** consistent eschatology and **C. H. Dodd's** realized eschatology. He argued that the **basileia tou theou** is both future and powerfully present in Jesus' ministry, most palpably in **table fellowship** with sinners, healings, and parables of **eschatological reversal**. The texture of his work is marked by short lemmas derived from the languages themselves, as when he reads the Eucharistic *zikkaron* as effective memorial and argues that Jesus spoke to God as **Abba** in a way that grounded his filial **Christology**. Under the pressure of **postwar** historical conscience, Jeremias developed a method that would neither retreat into dogmatic timelessness nor surrender to agnosticism about the past, positioning **historical-critical** exegesis as a means to reconstruct the **kerugma of Jesus** with pastoral and ecclesial consequences.

#### 2. Parables and the kingdom
The most celebrated instance of this method is **Die Gleichnisse Jesu** 1947, revised 1963 and translated as **The Parables of Jesus**, where Jeremias argued that the parables are compressed proclamations demanding **decision** in light of the urgent **kingdom of God**. Against the enduring influence of **Adolf Jülicher** who denied allegory tout court, and in constructive tension with **C. H. Dodd's** realized eschatology, Jeremias pressed a nuanced thesis: parables may feature controlled allegorical elements rooted in the **Sitz im Leben Jesu**, but their gestalt is a sharp, one-pointed summons because in Jesus the **eschatological visitation** has begun. The **Prodigal Son** reveals the scandal of divine mercy, the **Good Samaritan** the reversal of sacred boundary, and the **Unjust Steward** the prudence required by the impending crisis, each rendered more intelligible by Palestinian **social-economic** backgrounds and **Aramaic** idiom.

Methodologically, he worked from the Greek text to hypothesize **Aramaic substrata**, arguing that certain double entendres and rhythmic patterns cohere only in Semitic reconstructions. This yielded claims about the earliest form of particular parables and thus their theological thrust. Jeremias' appeal to land tenure, **tenant farming**, and **taxation** in Judea and Galilee contextualized the **Wicked Tenants** and **Laborers in the Vineyard**, resisting domestication of the message by embedding it in first-century **agrarian realities**. The payoff was doctrinal clarity about **grace**, **judgment**, and the **present-future** tension of the **kingdom**, not in abstraction but as the lived shock of Jesus' proclamation.

#### 3. The Eucharistic words and table fellowship
In **Die Abendmahlsworte Jesu** first issued 1935 and substantially revised 1960, known in English as **The Eucharistic Words of Jesus** 1966, Jeremias mounted a robust defense of the **historicity** and salvific significance of the **institution narrative**. He argued that the Last Supper is best understood within the horizon of **Passover**, even if the Synoptic-Johannine chronologies require careful harmonization, and that Jesus interpreted his death as **covenant** renewal grounded in **Jeremiah 31** and the **Suffering Servant** of **Isaiah 53**. The formula "for many" and the language of **remembrance** were read not as bare memorialism but as participation in the eschatological **new covenant**, where the *zikkaron* makes present the salvific deed of God.

Jeremias connected the Supper to Jesus' **table fellowship** with the unclean as enacted parable of forgiveness, reading **meals** as the social theater of **justification** and **reconciliation**. Against **Bultmann's** suspicion that the Eucharistic formulations were creations of the early church, he marshaled **Aramaisms** and Palestinian ritual patterns to argue that the grain of the sayings goes back to Jesus. Theologically, he thereby anchored Christian **sacramentology** in Jesus' own *Verkündigung* rather than merely in apostolic reflection, a move that has had lasting impact on liturgical theology across confessions, including **Lutheran** and **Reformed** discussions of the sacrament as means of grace.

#### 4. Social history of Jerusalem and the poor of the land
With **Jerusalem in the Time of Jesus** 1962, Jeremias turned to macro-level social history, assembling a vast dossier from **Mishnah**, **Tosefta**, **Targums**, and **Josephus** to reconstruct **economic stratification**, **debt loads**, **Temple finance**, and **priestly aristocracy** in late Second Temple **Jerusalem**. The aim was not antiquarianism but exegetical leverage for parables about **creditors and debtors**, **day laborers**, and the politics of **purity** and **taxation**. He painted a city of sharp contrasts where the **am ha-aretz** suffered under elite exactions, making plausible Jesus' harsh words against certain **scribal** practices and his compassion for the economically vulnerable.

Critiques have been significant. **E. P. Sanders** and **Sean Freyne** warned that Jeremias occasionally pressed later **rabbinic** materials too deterministically into the first century, risking **anachronism** and over-systematization of fluid social realities. Jeremias, however, anticipated such concerns by grading sources and prioritizing earlier strata, arguing that the convergence of diverse witnesses secures a high degree of probability. For exegesis his model brought unparalleled concreteness to texts like the **Cleansing of the Temple** and **the Widow's Mite**, enabling doctrinal reflection on **justice**, **mercy**, and the **ethics of the kingdom** in a historically located way.

#### 5. Abba, prayer, and sonship
In **The Prayers of Jesus** 1967 and related essays, Jeremias famously claimed that Jesus' invocation of God as **Abba** is distinctive and programmatic for his **filial consciousness** and for Christian **prayer**. He argued that while Jewish piety could call God Father, the direct use of **Abba** in address is without clear parallel before Jesus and explains its subsequent fixation in early Christian worship as seen in **Romans 8.15** and **Galatians 4.6**. On this basis he contended that Jesus' praxis of prayer reveals the theological soil of his confidence and obedience, illuminating his **Christology** and the shape of **discipleship** as childlike trust that issues in a forgiving stance captured in the **Lord's Prayer**.

Responses by **Geza Vermes** and **James Barr** cautioned against overstatement. They showed that **Abba** might not bear the diminutive intimacy of modern papa and that Jewish usage is more variegated than Jeremias allowed. Yet his broader thesis stands: prayer is a privileged site where the **kingdom** breaks into the present, and Jesus' **Sonship** frames the ethics of **forgiveness**, **enemy love**, and **dependence** on the Father. Theologically, Jeremias thereby linked linguistic detail to the nexus of **Christology**, **soteriology**, and **spirituality**, a hallmark of his integrative **historical-critical** craft.

#### 6. Baptism, households, and early church practice
A less-known but ecclesially potent contribution is **Infant Baptism in the First Four Centuries** 1960, where Jeremias argued for the antiquity of **paedobaptism** based on **household baptisms** in Acts, analogies with Jewish **proselyte baptism**, and a theology of **covenant** continuity. Against **Kurt Aland** and later **G. R. Beasley-Murray**, he claimed that the silence of the New Testament on explicit infant baptism is not decisive, given the social reality of extended households and the early church's immediate self-understanding in Israel's **covenantal** frame. He traced patristic evidence that, though diverse, points toward an early and widespread practice consistent with a soteriology of **grace** applied to the **church** as a people.

Critics questioned the weight of analogical arguments and warned against reading later **patristic** norms back into the apostolic age. Jeremias responded by appealing to his larger method: accumulate converging probabilities from **linguistic**, **socio-historical**, and **liturgical** data until a coherent picture emerges. Even where readers demur, the study exemplifies his conviction that **historical-critical** research and **ecclesial** doctrine can be mutually illuminating when governed by a disciplined use of sources.

#### 7. New Testament Theology and the kerygma of Jesus
Late in his career, Jeremias offered a synthesis in **New Testament Theology: The Proclamation of Jesus** 1971, articulating a coherent portrait of Jesus' **kerygma** around the **kingdom of God**, **forgiveness of sins**, and the demands of **discipleship**. He organized the material not around dogmatic loci but around the words and deeds of Jesus as remembered and interpreted by the early church, practicing **Traditionsgeschichte** to show continuity between Jesus and apostolic **kerygma**. The heart of the message is free **grace** received by **sinners**, instantiated in **table fellowship**, **parables**, and the **cross** interpreted as covenant-establishing mercy.

Here too his **ipsissima vox** principle is operative: the early church did not invent a message alien to Jesus but clarified and preached what Jesus had initiated. Jeremias insisted that **Pauline** and **Johannine** theology radicalize without distorting Jesus' proclamation, though he gave methodological priority to the Synoptics as the most immediate vehicles of Jesus' voice. The result is a **New Testament Theology** that is both historical and theological, skeptical of overarching metaphysical systems yet intent on showing the inner coherence of **kingdom**, **Christ**, and **church**.

#### 8. Debates, refinements, and legacy
Jeremias' work became a lightning rod for mid-century debates. His parable research sharpened disagreements with **Dodd** on realized eschatology and reopened the question of controlled **allegory** within parables. His **Abba** thesis was refined by **Vermes** and **Barr**, and his social-historical reconstructions were rebalanced by **E. P. Sanders** and later **social-scientific** approaches that more heavily utilized **anthropology** and **sociology**. Yet even critical reappraisals routinely adopt his categories, such as **Sitz im Leben Jesu**, **Aramaic substratum**, and the focus on **table fellowship** as enacted **eschatology**. In each area his blend of **philology**, **Jewish sources**, and disciplined **historical** imagination raised the level of argument and anchored theological claims in the concrete textures of Second Temple **Judaism**.

Jeremias' influence extended beyond the guild into catechesis and preaching, precisely because he tied the **kingdom of God** to real places like **Jerusalem**, real practices like shared **meals**, and real words like **forgiveness** and **covenant**. His insistence that exegesis is an ecclesial service without collapsing into **dogmatism** drew pastors and scholars into conversation. Even where his reconstructions have been modified, his questions endure: How do we hear Jesus' **voice** through the evangelists, how do we adjudicate between **history** and **kerygma**, and how do we let **Jewish** contexts discipline Christian interpretation without reducing the uniqueness of **Christ**?

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Jeremias is a strategic ally and a salutary foil. Positively, his insistence on the **historical** concreteness of the **basileia**, his defense of the **Eucharistic words** as authentically Jesus', and his argument for **covenantal** continuity in early **baptismal** practice furnish welcome ballast against speculative skepticism. His foregrounding of **Aramaic** and **Second Temple Judaism** strengthens the **grammatico-historical** sense of Scripture cherished in **Reformed** exegesis, and his eschatological focus resonates with a **redemptive-historical** reading that sees the **kingdom** as the climactic inbreaking of God's **covenant of grace**. Yet tensions remain. Jeremias' reliance on **criteria of authenticity**, the sharp distinction between *Sitz im Leben Jesu* and *Sitz im Leben der Kirche*, and the privileging of **ipsissima vox** over **ipsissima verba** risk displacing the canonical form of the Gospels as the Spirit-given norm and encourage a behind-the-text reconstruction that can become a theological second magisterium. A Reformed alternative would commend a canonical **authorial** focus in which the evangelists, as inspired witnesses, give the normative shape of Jesus' **self-revelation**, while still using **philology**, **archaeology**, and **Jewish** backgrounds as handmaids rather than arbiters. Where Jeremias sometimes leans on later **rabbinic** sources to secure historical probability, a **Vosian** biblical-theological approach would discipline background by the **organic unity** of redemptive history and the analogia Scripturae. On **Abba**, a Reformed reading would welcome the filial accent while anchoring its uniqueness christologically within the **Son's** mediatorial office rather than in putative linguistic exceptionalism. On **sacramentology**, Reformed theology gladly receives Jeremias' historical case for the institution but frames **Eucharist** and **baptism** within the covenantal administration of promise and presence, with the text itself rather than reconstructed subtexts as sufficient warrant. In short, Jeremias is best received as a rigorous tutor in the historical texture of the **Gospels**, whose tools serve the church well when subordinated to the **canonical Word**, the **redemptive-historical** economy, and the **self-authenticating** authority of Scripture.
