### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to kingdom biblical theology
Michael J. Vlach emerged in the world of late modern evangelicalism where **dispensationalism**, **biblical theology**, and debates over **Israel and the church** reshaped exegetical method and ecclesial identity. Trained in the post-Ryrie era but sensitive to the criticisms leveled by **covenant theologians** and by **progressive dispensationalists**, Vlach taught theology at **The Master’s Seminary** beginning in the mid-2000s and later joined **Shepherds Theological Seminary** in 2021. His vocational context placed him alongside figures like **John MacArthur** who maintained a robust **premillennial** and **restorationist** stance while increasingly drawing from the tools of **canonical biblical theology**. The convergence of these currents generated Vlach’s signature contribution: a coherent **kingdom-centered, new-creation** account of Scripture that retains a **literal** and **national-Israel** trajectory.

Vlach’s method is transparent. He emphasizes a **grammatical-historical** reading that seeks **authorial intent** and prioritizes the **plain sense** of Old Testament promises while acknowledging legitimate **typology**. He insists typology must be consistent with prior meaning and resists a leveling appeal to *sensus plenior* that would overturn **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** commitments. He frames interpretive judgments with a robust **progressive revelation** model, where later texts clarify but do not cancel earlier covenants. His use of the *analogia fidei* serves the **ad litteram** meaning rather than displacing it with what he regards as spiritualizing hermeneutics. This positions his work within the family of **revised dispensationalism**, while employing some vocabulary familiar to **progressive dispensationalism** such as **complementary fulfillment** and the **already-not yet** of the **kingdom**.

The intellectual catalysts for his approach include earlier dispensational synthesis like **Alva McClain’s The Greatness of the Kingdom** and the hermeneutical clarity of **Charles Ryrie’s Dispensationalism**, along with a constructive engagement with **George Eldon Ladd** on the **kingdom’s inaugurated structure**. At the same time, Vlach carries on a sustained dialogue with **G. K. Beale** and **N. T. Wright** whose **temple** and **new-creation** emphases he welcomes, while rejecting their frequent **supersessionist** trajectories. The question animating his scholarship is simple and repeated in his syllabi, lectures, and books: do the **Abrahamic**, **Davidic**, and **New** covenants find robust, historical fulfillment in a **restored Israel** within the **earthly kingdom**, or are they absorbed into a strictly ecclesial and spiritualized telos as in classic **amillennialism** and much **covenant theology**.

#### 2. Has the Church Replaced Israel and the architecture of restorationism
In **Has the Church Replaced Israel? A Theological Evaluation** 2010, revised 2016, Vlach offers a programmatic taxonomy and critique of **supersessionism**. Drawing on and refining **R. Kendall Soulen’s** distinctions, he identifies **punitive supersessionism** which sees Israel permanently cast off for disobedience, **economic supersessionism** which claims Israel’s preparatory role yields to the church’s permanent vocation, and **structural supersessionism** which embeds replacement into the framework of theology. Against these, Vlach argues for **restorationism**, the conviction that **national Israel** retains a future in God’s **kingdom** because the **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** covenants promise enduring **land**, **nation**, and **king** realities. The anchor texts are **Genesis 12 to 17**, **2 Samuel 7**, **Jeremiah 31**, **Ezekiel 36 to 37**, **Luke-Acts**, and **Romans 11** where the pledge that all Israel will be saved is taken as a future national turning.

Methodologically, the volume insists that the **New Testament’s use of the Old Testament** does not reverse prior promise. On **Acts 15 and Amos 9**, Vlach contends that James applies the restoration motif to Gentile inclusion as an anticipation of full **Davidic** restoration, not as its exhaustive fulfillment. On **Galatians 6.16**, he denies that the **Israel of God** phrase proves ecclesial supersession, reading it instead as a soteriological unity that does not erase ethnic-national identity. On **Hebrews**, he stresses that the **new covenant** is given explicitly to the house of **Israel and Judah**, shared by the church now yet still tethered to Israel’s eschatological renewal. The thesis is not two ways of salvation but one **new covenant** salvation with distinct **administrative** or functional roles in the **mediatorial kingdom**. This becomes a hallmark of Vlach’s **dispensational** synthesis: unity in **soteriology**, distinction in **history and vocation**.

#### 3. He Will Reign Forever and the kingdom as creational telos
With **He Will Reign Forever: A Biblical Theology of the Kingdom of God** 2017, Vlach widened the frame. The central claim is that the **kingdom** is the creational **telos**, constituted by God’s purpose for humanity under the **Edenic mandate** of Genesis 1.26 to 28, expressed in the **Abrahamic** pledge, institutionalized in **Davidic** kingship, secured by the **new covenant**, inaugurated in Jesus’ first advent, and consummated in an **earthly millennial reign** leading into the **new earth**. He distinguishes between God’s universal rule and the **mediatorial kingdom** administered through appointed representatives culminating in the **Messiah**. The storyline is not an otherworldly escape but a **new-creation** restoration in which the **land** promise is emblematic of the resurrection of creational order.

Exegetically, the book argues that Jesus’ present session at God’s right hand does not yet entail the **Davidic throne** in its historical fullness. The inaugurated **kingdom** is real, but the **Davidic covenant** requires a future **earthly** rule from Zion. Vlach therefore aligns with **premillennialism**, refusing to absorb **Revelation 20** into the present age. Covenantal continuity is affirmed through the cross and resurrection while covenantal specificity is maintained through the promise-pattern of **land**, **seed**, and **blessing**. He appropriates insights from **temple** and **new-creation** studies in **Beale** and from the **already-not yet** narrative of **Ladd**, yet he guards a **literal** interpretation of Israel’s future. The result is a **kingdom biblical theology** that marries a high view of typology with a firm grip on **national** and **geographical** realism.

#### 4. New Testament use of the Old and the limits of typology
Vlach’s **The Old in the New: Understanding How the New Testament Uses the Old Testament** 2021 extends his hermeneutical project. He outlines modes of linkage such as direct fulfillment, typological escalation, analogy, and verbal allusion, but he resists claims that the **New Testament** redefines **Israel**, **land**, or **covenant** in ways that cancel prior referents. He thus critiques versions of **canonical Christocentrism** that flatten the texture of promise by placing all **prophetic** and **covenantal** material within a spiritualized church. By contrast, he favors a **complementary fulfillment** model in which later revelation adds layers of significance without overturning earlier commitments.

Central to this book is a disciplined deployment of *sensus plenior*. Vlach grants that divine intention can exceed human authorial awareness, yet maintains that such plenitude will complement rather than contradict the **text’s literal sense**. On **Romans 9 to 11**, he underscores the integrity of Israel’s identity within the one people of God. On **Matthew’s** use of the Old Testament, he discerns typological patterns that anticipate the **Messiah’s** vocation yet leave space for the **Davidic** and **Abrahamic** promises to reach **geo-ethnic** realization. The concern is methodological: the **analogia fidei** must function as a harmonizing rule, not as a warrant for **hermeneutical metamorphosis** that dissolves **Israel’s** concrete future in the church’s spiritual present.

#### 5. Premillennial necessity and the rationale for an earthly reign
In **Premillennialism: Why There Must Be a Future Earthly Kingdom of Jesus** 2021, Vlach collects exegetical and theological reasons that the **Messiah’s reign** must include a historical stage prior to the eternal state. His argument proceeds along four lines. First, **justice and vindication** require that the very earth that rejected the King witness his public reign. Second, **covenant fulfillment** demands a historical administration in which **Davidic kingship** and **Abrahamic land** converge in a global rule from Zion. Third, a millennial structure best accounts for **Revelation 20’s** temporal sequence and the differential states of resurrected saints and mortal nations. Fourth, the millennium serves as a pedagogical dispensation displaying the triumph of **God’s grace** and the final exposure of human rebellion even under ideal conditions before the **new earth**.

The work targets **amillennial** readings that fold the millennium into the interadvental age and **postmillennial** readings that locate kingdom triumph within church history. Vlach affirms real **inauguration** now yet denies that the eschatological **Davidic rule** is realized until the King returns. The emphasis falls on promise specificity rather than general hope. He interacts with **Anthony Hoekema** and **Kim Riddlebarger**, acknowledging their canonical discipline while challenging their **typological compression** of **land** and **nation** into a purely ecclesial symbol. For Vlach, **premillennialism** is not an optional add-on to Christian hope but an inference from the **covenantal fabric** of Scripture.

#### 6. The new creation model and a dispensational retrieval of creational eschatology
In **The New Creation Model: A Paradigm for Biblical Theology** 2023, Vlach consolidates his vision. The controlling contrast is between a **spiritual-vision model** that prioritizes an immaterial heaven and a **new-creation model** that majors on the renewal of the created order. Aligning with a broad evangelical recovery of **creational eschatology** exemplified by **Wright** and **Beale**, he retools these insights within a **dispensational** frame. The **new creation** does not dilute the **Israel** thread but elevates it as the firstfruits of global restoration, with **land promises** becoming the epicenter of an earth-wide inheritance.

This model reframes debates about **Israel and the church**. Rather than a binary of one versus two peoples, Vlach proposes one **redeemed humanity** under the **new covenant** with complementary **historical roles**. Under the **mediatorial kingdom**, **Israel** functions as a restored nation among nations, and the **church** as the multinational bride and priestly people. The unity lies in **Christ** and the **Spirit**; the distinction lies in the **administration** of history’s climax. By rendering the **land** and **nation** themes as creational rather than purely redemptive symbols, Vlach aims to show that **dispensationalism** best accounts for the concrete scope of **redemption**, where salvation renews creation rather than evacuates it.

#### 7. Interlocutors, exegetical cruxes, and method under pressure
Vlach’s project advances through pointed engagements with specific texts and interlocutors. On **Acts 2 and Psalm 110**, he argues the present exaltation of Jesus fulfills **priestly** enthronement but anticipates **Davidic** kingship. This diverges from **progressive dispensationalists** like **Blaising** and **Bock** who see a greater measure of **Davidic** realization now, though he shares with them a **complementary** hermeneutic and an emphasis on **inauguration**. On **Amos 9 in Acts 15**, he affirms present Gentile incorporation as a sign that the **Davidic** restoration is underway without being exhaustively fulfilled. On **Hebrews 8 to 10**, he demurs from **covenant theology** that universalizes the **new covenant** in such a way that **Israel’s** specified recipients are merely typological.

He also addresses classic objections. Does an **Israel-church distinction** compromise the unity of salvation. Vlach insists no, since the **ordo salutis** is one, grounded in **union with Christ** and the **Spirit**, while the **historia salutis** retains designed diversity. Does his view minimize **typology**. He replies that typology explains how earlier patterns reach their richest form without denying their **earthly** and **national** realization. Does insisting on **literal land** and **nation** risk ethnocentrism. He answers that the final **kingdom** is multiethnic, and **Israel’s** restoration functions as a vehicle of blessing for the nations, not a rival to catholicity. Throughout, his hermeneutic is an exercise in disciplined **authorial intent**, guarded *sensus plenior*, and a strong **canonical** coherence that never permits later texts to negate earlier promises.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and the profile of Vlach’s dispensationalism
The doctrinal picture that emerges is consistent across Vlach’s corpus. On **Scripture and hermeneutics**, he privileges the **grammatical-historical** sense oriented by **progressive revelation**. On **God and creation**, redemption is the restoration of creation culminating in the **new earth**. On **Christ and kingdom**, the **Messiah’s mediatorial reign** is both inaugurated and future, with full **Davidic** expression in a **premillennial** epoch. On **covenants**, the **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** covenants are unconditional and eternally valid, the **Mosaic** covenant is temporary, and the **new covenant** secures heart renewal for Israel and the nations. On **ecclesiology**, the **church** is one new man in Christ without erasing **Israel’s** national vocation. On **eschatology**, **Revelation 20’s** first resurrection and millennial reign are literal, with **Satan’s** defeat and the **nations** judged prior to the **new creation**.

Vlach’s style is not speculative metaphysics but **biblical theology** advancing a comprehensive **kingdom** horizon. He maximizes continuity between creation and consummation while preserving the textual specificity of **Israel’s** role. He leverages the **new-creation** paradigm to respond to charges that **dispensationalism** is otherworldly and escapist. The result is a streamlined, restorationist **dispensationalism** that speaks fluently in the idiom of **kingdom** and **new creation**, answering both **covenant theology’s** critique of discontinuity and **progressive dispensationalism’s** stronger already-now emphasis on **Davidic** enthronement.

#### 9. Strengths, limits, and a Reformed-WTS evaluation
A Reformed and Westminster-leaning evaluation can register both the power and the pressure points of Vlach’s system. His strongest contribution is the integration of **new-creation** realism with **kingdom** and **covenant** specificity, a salutary correction to any spiritual-vision eschatology that neglects the **earthly** scope of redemption. His **authorial-intent** rigor and disciplined *analogia fidei* keep exegesis tethered to the texts and resist speculative allegory. Yet classic **Reformed** concerns remain. First, on **hermeneutics**, the Reformed typological tradition contends that the **Christ-event** is determinative in a way that changes, not merely complements, the horizon of **land** and **nation**, so that the **new covenant** community in **Christ** is the final form of **Israel**, not a distinct partner alongside a restored nation. Second, on **covenant theology**, the **covenant of grace** structures Scripture’s unity such that **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** promises reach their fullness in the catholic church without requiring a geopolitical phase. Third, on **eschatology**, **amillennial** readings see **Revelation 20** as recapitulative and locate the **Davidic** throne in Christ’s present reign, with **Romans 11** promising a massive Jewish ingathering into the one people of God rather than a renewed national polity. From a **WTS** vantage, a redemptive-historical hermeneutic prioritizes the **Christocentric** fulfillment pattern so thoroughly that Vlach’s ongoing Israel-church distinction appears to sustain a level of **administrative duality** arguably out of step with the confessional vision of the **one covenant people**. The Reformed alternative preserves **new-creation** realism and **kingdom** telos while seeing typology as transformative rather than merely additive, the **church** as the eschatological **Israel**, and the **land** promise as fulfilled in the world-encompassing inheritance of the **new earth** already secured in the ascended **Davidic King**.
