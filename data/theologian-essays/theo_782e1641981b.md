### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andrew Wilson stands at the crossroads of **British evangelicalism**, shaped by the **Newfrontiers** movement’s **Reformed-charismatic** synthesis in the early twenty-first century and the secularizing cultural pressures of a **post-Christian UK**. As a pastor-theologian associated with **King’s Church London** and the **Think Theology** project, his public vocation combines preaching, writing, and debate in venues that range from church conferences to national media. Theologically, his signature contribution is a both-and integration: **biblical authority** is nonnegotiable, yet **charismatic gifts** are prized; **creedal orthodoxy** is received, and **liturgical form** is retrieved; **pastoral formation** is central, while **cultural analysis** is earnest and historically informed. This integrated method is forged against the background of figures like **Terry Virgo** within Newfrontiers and a wider conversation with **John Stott**, **J. I. Packer**, and **N. T. Wright**, while remaining alert to **Augustinian** depth and **Calvin’s** robust God-centeredness.

Wilson’s epistemic stance is an evangelical confidence that **Scripture interprets Scripture**, with **canonical-biblical theology** and **typology** functioning as primary tools. He is unembarrassed by *figura* and **intertextuality**, but he seeks exegetical controls within the canon’s own narrative seams. In ethos, he is a pastoral **retrievalist** who pursues **catholicity** without abandoning **charismatic continuationism**, convinced that charismatic immediacy and catholic depth belong together in the church’s *telos*.

#### 2. Early works: catechesis, apologetics, and Scripture
Wilson’s first major book, **Incomparable: Explorations in the Character of God** (2007), is catechetical and doxological, rehearsing divine perfections with evangelical clarity and a readable style. The work displays his commitment to **Nicene trinitarianism**, **Chalcedonian christology**, and classic themes such as **divine holiness** and **grace**, presented for congregational formation. The apologetic **If God, Then What?** (2012) continues in a similar register, advancing a cumulative case for **Christian theism** in a late-modern context, with a posture that blends **C. S. Lewis**-like plausibility-building and pastoral invitation. The strategic nerve center appears in **Unbreakable: What the Son of God Said about the Word of God** (2014), where Wilson argues that **biblical authority** is grounded in **Jesus’ doctrine of Scripture**, pressing **inerrancy** and **trustworthiness** by attending to the Lord’s own appeals to **Torah**, **Prophets**, and **Psalms**. Across these works, he sets markers for a theological method in which **Christology** authorizes **Bibliology**, **doctrine** serves **discipleship**, and **catechesis** remains missionally urgent.

This early period also reveals Wilson’s resonance with **Reformed soteriology** and **penal substitution**, characteristic of Newfrontiers’ doctrinal profile. Yet he refuses a reductionistic biblicism, regularly citing **Augustine** on ordered loves and **Calvin** on the **Spirit’s illumination**, signaling that the **regula fidei** frames biblical reading even as **sola Scriptura** rules theological adjudication.

#### 3. Echoes of Exodus: typology and canonical unity
With **Echoes of Exodus: Tracing Themes of Redemption through Scripture** (2018), coauthored with **Alastair Roberts**, Wilson leans into **biblical theology** as a discipline. The thesis is that the **exodus** is the master-pattern of **redemption**, refigured through **Israel’s history**, **prophetic hope**, **Christ’s paschal work**, and **Christian sacramental practice**. The book tracks motifs of **bondage**, **deliverance**, **Passover**, **new creation**, **wilderness**, and **inheritance**, showing how the canon’s unity is heard as musical recapitulation. Influences include **N. T. Wright’s** narrative reading, **Peter Leithart’s** figural imagination, and a broadly **Augustinian** sense that the **Old** is in the **New** revealed.

Wilson’s typological method aims for canonical discipline: **exodus typology** is not free association but a recognition of redemptive-historical **recapitulation**. The pastoral payoff is homiletic: preaching **Christ crucified and risen** through the exodus lens forms a people living as a **pilgrim church** between tyrannies and promises. The work strengthens Wilson’s reputation as a guide to **intertextual Scripture**, even as it invites questions about the boundary between **exegesis** and **edifying figuration**.

#### 4. Spirit and Sacrament: toward Eucharismatic worship
Wilson’s most distinctive proposal appears in **Spirit and Sacrament: An Invitation to Eucharismatic Worship** (2019). Here he argues that the evangelical future requires welding **charismatic gifts** to **historic liturgy** and especially a robust **Eucharistic** center. He critiques a thin **memorialism** and a routinized **cessationism** on one side, and an **anticreedal experientialism** on the other. Mining **1 Corinthians 12–14**, **Acts**, and **Luke**, he contends for ongoing **prophecy**, **tongues**, and **healing**, while retrieving **creeds**, **confession of sin**, **psalmody**, and weekly **communion** as formative means of grace. He deploys **Calvin’s spiritual presence** view as a bridge between charismatic immediacy and catholic sacramentality, proposing that **the Spirit**, not an ontology of elements alone, renders the Supper vital.

The watchword is **Eucharismatic**: a portmanteau that signals a liturgy where **Word and sacrament** order worship, while **gifts of the Spirit** edify the body. Wilson appeals appreciatively to **Wayne Grudem** and **Sam Storms** on continuationism, to **Augustine** on sacramental signs, and to **Calvin** on **the ascended Christ** who feeds the church by **the Spirit**. The result is not a full sacramental system but a pastoral rule of thumb: seek the **ordinary means**, invite the **extraordinary gifts**, and let the **creeds** and **calendar** train desire.

#### 5. God of All Things: sacramental ontology in everyday life
In **God of All Things: Rediscovering the Sacred in an Everyday World** (2021), Wilson broadens Eucharismatic instincts into a **sacramental ontology** of creation. Through brief biblical meditations on things like **dust**, **stones**, **bread**, **wine**, **serpents**, and **sparrows**, he re-enchants the world under **divine providence** and **creation’s goodness**. The animating conviction is that the created order is charged with **significance** and that **Scripture’s metaphors** are not merely illustrative but participatory vehicles of **wisdom**. This is not a metaphysical treatise but a catechetical aesthetic in which **signs and creatures** are tutors unto **doxology**.

Wilson’s sources here are varied: **Genesis** and **Psalms** for creational praise, **Proverbs** for wisdom’s pedagogy, hints of **Augustine’s signum-res** distinction, and a popularized echo of **James K. A. Smith’s** insights on **liturgy and desire**. The book’s pastoral aim is to form attentiveness, restrain disenchantment, and reintegrate **doctrine and devotion** by learning to see the **mundane** as a theater of **grace**.

#### 6. Remaking the World: 1776 and the post-Christian West
Wilson’s cultural history, **Remaking the World: How 1776 Created the Post-Christian West** (2023), pivots from theology to **intellectual history** while retaining theological stakes. He argues that the year **1776** crystallized several transformations that have structured modernity: the **American Declaration of Independence** and new **political sovereignty**, **Adam Smith’s Wealth of Nations** and modern **economics**, **Gibbon’s Decline and Fall** and **historical imagination**, expanding **print culture** and **public discourse**, imperial **globalization**, and early currents toward **abolition** and **rights**. Drawing on **Charles Taylor**’s account of **secularity** and engaging public historians like **Tom Holland**, Wilson narrates how these shifts set the stage for a **post-Christian moral ecology** in which **freedom**, **markets**, **nationhood**, and **pluralism** recalibrated the West’s plausibility structures.

Theologically, the book is an extended meditation on **providence** and **mission** under late-modern conditions. Wilson neither demonizes nor baptizes 1776’s bequests; he calls churches to inhabit the West’s gains and losses with **neighbor love**, **catechesis**, and **confident witness**. The same **Eucharismatic** instincts appear as strategy: deepen **Word and sacrament**, exercise **charisms**, and engage the **polis** with patience and hope.

#### 7. Ethics, suffering, and pastoral credibility
Wilson’s pastoral theology is textured by his engagement with **suffering** and morally contested questions. In **The Life We Never Expected** (2016), coauthored with his wife, he narrates parenting children with **autism**, drawing theological lines from **lament** and **providence** to **hope** and **community**. The book gives existential ballast to his doctrinal claims, rooting **theodicy** and **sanctification** in the ordinary burdens of family life. In the public-square, Wilson has defended **historic sexual ethics** and **complementarian** convictions with a tone shaped by **pastoral care** rather than polemical heat, often engaging figures like **Steve Chalke** in UK debates about **marriage** and **Scripture**. Here too **biblical authority** is the fulcrum, yet he frames obedience within an Augustinian **ordo amoris**, urging churches to embody **chastity**, **hospitality**, and **mercy**.

These ethical engagements reinforce Wilson’s theological method: Scripture is supreme, **tradition** is a guide, **experience** is acknowledged yet chastened, and **mission** remains the horizon. His rhetoric regularly presses the church to be a **distinctive community**, knit together by **Word**, **table**, and **Spirit** in a culture suspicious of authority and allergic to chastity.

#### 8. Doctrinal profile and interlocutors
Across his corpus, Wilson’s doctrinal profile remains recognizably evangelical: **Trinity**, **incarnation**, **substitutionary atonement**, **resurrection**, and **justification by faith** are central. His **ecclesiology** is free-church and **credobaptist**, yet open to **liturgical** and **sacramental** depth characteristic of the great tradition. On **pneumatology**, he is a convinced **continuationist**, following streams flowing through **Wayne Grudem** and **Sam Storms**, while distancing himself from prosperity distortions by re-centering **the cross** and **holiness**. On **hermeneutics**, he embraces **typology** constrained by **canonical unity**, reading Scripture with **Augustine** and **Calvin**, and attending to contemporary guides like **N. T. Wright** and **Peter Leithart**.

Wilson’s intellectual companions beyond biblical studies include **James K. A. Smith** on **liturgies of desire**, **Charles Taylor** on the **conditions of belief**, and public historians like **Tom Holland** on Christianity’s moral imprint. He interacts with **Oliver O’Donovan** on **political theology** and appeals to classic catechisms for doctrinal ballast. The result is a lively **evangelical catholicity**: generous to the wider church, confident in **sola Scriptura**, and alert to **mission** in the late-modern West.

#### 9. Method integrated: Eucharismatic retrieval for mission
The integrative force of Wilson’s project is the conviction that the church’s renewal requires a convergence of **biblical theology**, **charismatic vitality**, and **catholic liturgy**. His **Eucharismatic** proposal is not a novelty for novelty’s sake; it is a strategy of retrieval that binds **Word**, **table**, and **charism** for the sake of **discipleship** and **witness**. The canonical **exodus** frame underwrites a pilgrim identity, **sacramental ontology** re-enchants everyday obedience, and cultural history like **Remaking the World** equips leaders to read modernity’s scripts without capitulation. The energy of the project is pastoral: to shape people who love **orthodoxy**, practice **hospitality**, and expect **the Spirit** to speak and heal.

At the same time, Wilson insists that **authority** is not located in experience or tradition but in **Scripture**, interpreted within the **rule of faith**. He charts a via media by affirming **creeds**, practicing **confession**, and nurturing **psalmic prayer**, while inviting **prophetic speech** and **healing prayer** as biblically warranted and ecclesially edifying. The center holds because the center is **Christ**, ascended and present by **the Spirit**, feeding his people at the **Eucharist** and sending them into a world that 1776 has profoundly re-scripted.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Wilson’s project resonates strongly at key points while inviting principled critique. Positively, his **sola Scriptura** posture, **Nicene-Chalcedonian** fidelity, **covenantal** attention to the canon’s unity, and retrieval of **Word and sacrament** align with **Westminster Confession** commitments to the **sufficiency of Scripture**, the **ordinary means of grace**, and creedal orthodoxy. His **exodus typology** honors **redemptive history** and his cultural analysis respects **providence** without speculative overreach. Yet there are tensions. His **continuationism** challenges confessional **cessationist** readings of **1 Corinthians 13** and the sufficiency of **Scripture** in relation to congregational **prophecy**, raising questions about the norming authority of extraordinary gifts within the **regulative principle of worship**. His **Eucharismatic** affirmation of weekly communion and charismatic ministry can grate against stricter **regulative** patterns that limit elements to those explicitly instituted, and his liturgical retrieval, while salutary, sometimes lacks fully articulated **sacramental theology** in the **Calvin–Westminster** line, particularly regarding the **spiritual presence** and the **efficacy of the Supper** as a covenantal seal. Moreover, his **credobaptist** practice sits uneasily with **covenant child** inclusion in **paedobaptism**, a fault line not incidental to Reformed ecclesiology. A Westminster alternative would stress the primacy of the **ordinary means of grace**, a cessationist or at least non-normative stance on **sign gifts**, a tighter **covenantal** account of **baptism** and **the Supper**, and a more rigorously **grammatico-historical** control on **typology** within the church’s preaching. Still, measured through the core of Reformed orthodoxy, Wilson emerges as a constructive evangelical ally whose **Eucharismatic** synthesis prompts fruitful conversation about **worship**, **mission**, and **formation** in a disenchanted age.
