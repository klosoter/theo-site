### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Born in 1535 in Cuenca, **Luis de Molina** entered the **Society of Jesus** in 1553, receiving formation amid the Iberian **Second Scholasticism** that shaped Catholic responses to the **Reformation**. He studied at **Coimbra**, absorbed the methods of the **Conimbricenses**, and taught philosophy and theology at **Evora** from 1568 to 1591 before moving to the **Colegio Imperial** in Madrid, where he died in 1600. His intellectual world combined **Aquinas** and **Augustine** with late medieval debates, yet it was decisively Jesuit and missionary, pressing theology toward moral casuistry, pastoral prudence, and engagement with emergent political economies. Molina’s method was classically scholastic: **quaestiones**, **disputationes**, careful distinctions, and an appeal to both **natural theology** and revelation construed as authoritative tradition. Theologically, he sought to reconcile the **absoluteness of divine providence** with **liberi arbitrii**, resisting both determinism and Pelagianism. The resulting synthesis drew sharp controversy with **Dominican** defenders of **Thomist praemotio physica**, setting the stage for the **De auxiliis** debates over **grace**, **predestination**, and **free will**.

#### 2. The project of De concordia
Molina’s most famous work, **De concordia liberi arbitrii cum gratiae donis, divina praescientia, praedestinatione et reprobatione, providentia** published in Lisbon in 1588, is a sustained attempt to show that **divine foreknowledge** and **predestination** neither extinguish nor trivialize **human freedom**. The treatise retrieves a tripartite structure of divine knowledge while advancing a distinctive middle term. God possesses **scientia naturalis**, necessary knowledge of all possibilities grounded in the divine essence, and **scientia libera**, free knowledge of the actual order grounded in the decree. Molina adds **scientia media**, middle knowledge of conditionals about what contingent creatures would freely do in any specified circumstance. Through this taxonomy he aims to preserve **divine simplicity** and **immutability** while ensuring that **providence** is meticulous and **grace** truly aids rather than compels. The work’s polemical edge is sharpened against **Banezian Thomism**, especially the claim that God moves the will by a prior **physical premotion** that infallibly specifies every free act.

#### 3. Scientia media and counterfactuals of freedom
The heart of **Molinism** is the claim that God knows true **counterfactuals of creaturely freedom** prior to the divine decree. These are conditionals of the form God knows that if person S were in circumstance C, S would freely do action A. On Molina’s account **scientia media** is logically posterior to **scientia naturalis** yet logically prior to **scientia libera**. It is not grounded in the decree, for that would make freedom illusory, nor in sheer creaturely self-causation, for that would imperil **divine omniscience**. Molina locates the truth of such conditionals in the nexus of creaturely essences, created powers, and determinate circumstances as comprehended by God’s perfect intellect. God’s grasp of essences and circumstances yields knowledge of what libertarian agents would do without causally determining them. By interposing **middle knowledge**, Molina contends that God can choose, among a set of worlds He deems **feasible**, one in which His **providence** is accomplished through genuinely free choices. The distinction safeguards **voluntariness** and meaningful **responsibility**, while preserving the infallibility of **foreknowledge** and the efficacy of **providence**.

#### 4. Grace, predestination, and the order of the decree
Within the soteriological locus, **De concordia** reconfigures the relation of **grace** and **freedom**. Molina affirms **sufficient grace** given to all, a real divine aid that empowers without determining. **Efficacious grace** is not an ontologically different entity but the same grace considered together with the free consent that God foreknows by **scientia media**. Grace is efficacious per accidens, that is, in virtue of the congruity between grace and the disposition of the will in this circumstance. This strategy opposes both **Pelagian self-sufficiency** and **Banezian premotion**, insisting on a synergistic cooperation. Correspondingly, **predestination** is set in an order often summarized as **praedestinatio post praevisa merita**, election conditioned by foreknown free cooperation with grace. Molina carefully states that the merits are themselves graced, yet they are freely assented to and so can be foreknown without necessitation. On **reprobation**, he defends a permissive divine will, where God permits sin foreseen through **middle knowledge** rather than predetermines it. The overall picture is of a God who wills salvation universally, apportions **auxilia gratiae**, and executes **providence** by choosing a world in which His salvific purposes are realized through non-coercive means.

#### 5. Concurrentism and the rejection of physical premotion
A pivotal metaphysical plank is **concursus simultaneus**, a doctrine of simultaneous divine concurrence with secondary causes. Against **Banez** and Dominican **praemotio physica**, which posits a prior determinate divine influx specifying the act of the will, Molina argues that God concurses with creaturely acts as they are freely specified by the creature. God is the universal cause of being and action, yet not the determiner of the modal specification free vs. not free. This concurrentism secures a genuine **secondary causality** without positing pockets of autonomy outside **divine conservation**. It also grounds moral responsibility through a robust **libertarian freedom**, understood as the power of alternative possibilities and ultimate sourcehood, while refusing both occasionalism and determinism. Molina insists that the concurrence is infallibly known by God through **scientia media**, so that divine governance remains certain even as the causal pathway allows for authentic choice.

#### 6. The De auxiliis controversy and ecclesial reception
Molina’s proposals ignited the famed **De auxiliis** controversy, pitting **Jesuits** against **Dominicans** from the late 1580s to 1607. Figures like **Domingo Banez** and later **Diego Alvarez** charged Molina with undermining **Augustinian grace** and evacuating **predestination** of its unconditional character. Jesuit theologians, including **Robert Bellarmine**, **Gregory of Valencia**, and eventually **Francisco Suarez**, refined Molinist themes and defended **middle knowledge**. Pope **Clement VIII** convened the **Congregatio de Auxiliis** in 1597, a special commission that interrogated both sides for a decade. In 1607, under **Paul V**, the papacy closed the proceedings without condemnation, permitting both schools within **Roman Catholic** orthodoxy while forbidding mutual recriminations. This non-decision institutionalized a pluralism within Catholic soteriology, with **Molinism** and **Banezianism** coexisting under the capacious Augustinian and Thomistic heritage. Later Jesuit developments under the label **Congruism** sought to refine Molina’s account of **efficacious grace** by specifying forms of grace that are congruent with a person’s disposition and state, a move associated with **Suarez** and others that tightened the account of infallible efficacy without abandoning **libertarian freedom**.

#### 7. Moral theology, economics, and natural law
Beyond metaphysics and soteriology, Molina contributed significantly to early modern moral theology through **De iustitia et iure**, a multivolume work begun in 1593 with posthumous volumes following through 1609. In it he applies **natural law** and **ius gentium** to questions of commerce, **just price**, **contracts**, **usury**, slavery, and political authority. While indebted to the **School of Salamanca** exemplified by **Francisco de Vitoria** and **Domingo de Soto**, Molina’s Jesuit posture shapes a more detailed casuistry attentive to concrete cases, developing what later moralists would call **probabilism**. His economic reflections calibrate **market price** with common estimation under conditions of information, scarcity, and risk, thereby anticipating elements of later economic theory while remaining anchored in **justice** as a virtue. These practical treatises display the same confidence in **secondary causes**, human prudence, and the intelligibility of social life that undergirds his account of **providence**, giving Molina a wider legacy than the purely speculative debates might suggest.

#### 8. Metaphysical grammar and the logic of divine knowing
Molina’s conceptual grammar draws from **divine ideas** and a robust doctrine of possibility, often read as a forerunner to a possible-worlds semantics. By distinguishing **scientia naturalis**, **scientia media**, and **scientia libera**, he locates the modalities of truth in God in different logical orders without introducing composition in the divine essence. The truths of counterfactuals are not brute facts independent of God, for they presuppose divine ideas and creative wisdom, yet they are not products of the decree, for that would collapse freedom. Molina’s appeal to the fit between **essences**, circumstances, and free operations strives to avoid both **necessitarianism** and **voluntarism**, preserving the axioms of **divine simplicity** while rejecting any model that makes God the author of sin. He engages **Aquinas** with respect and revision, invoking **Augustine** on grace yet resisting predestinarian readings, and opposes both **Scotist** modalism and **Ockhamist** contingency where those undermine a stable order of providence. Scripture is read within the **scholastic** tradition, with texts like **Romans 8–9** and **1 Timothy 2** harmonized through the logic of universal salvific will, permissive decrees, and **foreknowledge** of free cooperation.

#### 9. Reception, influence, and modern retrievals
The afterlife of **Molinism** has been diverse. Within Catholicism, **Suarez** systematized aspects of **congruism**, and **Bellarmine** defended a pastoral deployment of **middle knowledge** that elevated missionary preaching and moral exhortation. In Protestant lands, **Arminius** engaged elements congenial to conditional predestination and universal grace, while Reformed scholastics like **Francis Turretin** criticized **scientia media** as incoherent. In early modern philosophy, thinkers such as **Leibniz** rearticulated a choice among compossible worlds under **divine wisdom**, a family resemblance that kept Molinist themes active. In contemporary analytic theology, the language of **counterfactuals of freedom**, **feasible worlds**, and the **grounding objection** has made Molina a living interlocutor in discussions of **providence**, **evil**, and **prayer**. Even debates on **Christology** and **incarnation** have tested whether **middle knowledge** can illuminate the human knowing of the **Logos** in time. Throughout, Molina’s central wager remains compelling to many: that **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom** can be affirmed together with neither reduction nor compromise.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Molina’s project exhibits both strengths and fault lines. Positively, his affirmation of **meticulous providence**, his defense of robust **secondary causality**, and his moral seriousness about **natural law** align with classical Christian convictions. Yet the Molinist synthesis strains against the **Westminster Confession of Faith** on the **decree**, **unconditional election**, and **effectual calling**. By making the decree conditioned on **foreknown free cooperation**, **predestination post praevisa merita** risks subordinating **grace** to humanly indexed facts and diluting the asymmetry of **regeneration** in **monergistic** salvation. The **grounding objection** remains acute, since truths about what libertarian agents would do appear either independent of God, challenging **divine aseity**, or dependent on the decree, collapsing **libertarian freedom**. Molinist exegesis of **Romans 9** and **John 6** seems to domesticate texts that speak of **irresistible grace** and **particular election**, whereas **compatibilist freedom** within a doctrine of **decretal concursus** can preserve responsibility without positing counterfactual independence from God’s will. A Reformed alternative thus urges a robust **simple and eternal decree**, **unconditional election**, and **irresistible grace**, while retaining genuine **secondary causes** and a richly textured **covenant** account of history. On this reading, Molina’s aim to vindicate both **providence** and **freedom** is commendable, but the **scientia media** device proves neither exegetically mandated nor metaphysically stable when measured by classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **WTS** commitment to the primacy of **revelation** over speculative construction.
