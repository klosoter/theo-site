### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
William Edgar emerges within a distinctly **Reformed and Westminster** tradition, occupying a space where **Cornelius Van Til’s presuppositionalism** meets a cosmopolitan engagement with European letters and music. Trained in the humanities in the 1960s and then at **Westminster Theological Seminary**, Edgar later completed doctoral work in Geneva, positioning himself at a crossroads between Anglophone **Reformed orthodoxy** and Francophone philosophical currents. This setting matters: Edgar’s apologetics is born in dialogue with **Pascal**, **Camus**, and **Derrida**, while remaining tethered to **Calvin**, **Kuyper**, and **Bavinck**, thereby marrying a **covenantal epistemology** to a supple cultural intelligence. The method he articulates lifts up the Augustinian theme of **antithesis** between the City of God and the City of Man, yet it also insists on robust **common grace** and **general revelation**, reframed under Scripture so that no corner of culture is hermetically sealed from the claims of **Christ’s lordship**.

Edgar’s signature methodological move is to rehabilitate **persuasion** as a theological category within **apologetics**, drawing on **Blaise Pascal’s raisons du coeur** and the classical **ethos-pathos-logos** triad, while refusing any concession to **autonomous reason**. For Edgar, the human person is a covenanted knower, the **imago Dei** whose cognitive life is morally located either in covenantal obedience or in suppressive unbelief as **Romans 1** portrays. Thus **proof** and **witness**, **argument** and **appeal**, belong together, not because reason is self-legislating, but because the Spirit can employ arguments and aesthetic resonance as **means** of drawing the heart to the truth. This is **presuppositionalism** tempered by pastoral patience, cultural literacy, and a deep sense of **creation-fall-redemption** as the meta-structure of knowing.

#### 2. Reasons of the Heart and the ethics of persuasion
The book **Reasons of the Heart: Recovering Christian Persuasion** 1996 is Edgar’s manifesto for a chastened, humane **cultural apologetics**. He retrieves **Pascal’s** insight that belief often turns not on geometrical demonstration but on the ordered loves of the *coeur*, translating **Augustine’s ordo amoris** into late-modern debates. Without endorsing **natural theology** in a Thomistic sense, Edgar argues for harnessing **general revelation** through lines of moral, aesthetic, and existential **persuasion** that awaken memory traces of the **imago Dei**. He commends arguments from **beauty**, the appeal of **meaning**, and the burden of **guilt** as pathways to the gospel, while reiterating the **Van Tilian** warning against neutrality and the **Kantian** and **Cartesian** pretensions of the autonomous self.

In this frame, **ethos** speaks through the credibility of the apologist’s life, **pathos** through empathetic understanding of the hearer’s condition, and **logos** through clear reasoning that is self-consciously **covenantal**. Edgar’s distinctive contribution is to show how **apologetics** participates in the church’s **mission** not by winning at the tribunal of public reason but by bearing **witness** that is truthful, morally serious, and attuned to the arts of **communication**. He thus draws a line from **Van Til’s antithesis** to **Pascal’s allure**, arguing that persuasion is not manipulation but a Spirit-enabled summons to reality under **Christ’s lordship**.

#### 3. Truth in All Its Glory and commending the Reformed faith
In **Truth in All Its Glory: Commending the Reformed Faith** 2004, Edgar steps back from apologetic tactics to delineate the **Reformed system** as a coherent, life-giving vision. The book is part catechesis, part cultural manifesto, setting out the **sola Scriptura**, **sola gratia**, and **soli Deo gloria** coordinates alongside **covenant theology**, **divine sovereignty**, and **worship** as a God-centered reorientation of life. The argument is not triumphalist; Edgar positions **Reformed catholicity** as a posture of grateful reception rather than a sectarian badge. Yet he is unapologetic about contrasts, especially critiquing **autonomous humanism**, **Romantic self-expression**, and thin **therapeutic religion** that dilutes **sin** and **grace**. The **method** here is characteristic: a confident, generous **Reformed orthodoxy** that explains itself in public without reducing itself to public reason, thus maintaining the **antithesis** while extending the hand of **persuasion**.

The work also elaborates Edgar’s reliance on **Herman Bavinck** and **Abraham Kuyper** for an integrated account of **creation** and **culture**. He insists the **imago Dei** is structurally intact though directionally fallen, so Christians may receive and redirect cultural goods under **Christ’s kingship**. The theological payoff is twofold: rejecting sheer withdrawal from culture while resisting **immanentist** accounts that confuse **common grace** with saving grace. The balance of **antithesis and common grace** will recur across Edgar’s corpus, animating everything from apologetics to the arts.

#### 4. Mapping the tradition: Christian Apologetics Past and Present
The two-volume reader **Christian Apologetics Past and Present** Vol. 1 2009 and Vol. 2 2011, co-edited with **K. Scott Oliphint**, is a canonical contribution to the **history of apologetics**. By curating sources from **Justin Martyr** and **Augustine** to **Anselm** and **Aquinas**, and then from **Calvin**, **Kuyper**, and **Van Til** to modern voices, Edgar shows that Christian defense has always been multi-voiced, embedded in concrete **mission** and **worship**. The editorial introductions, while sympathetic to **covenantal apologetics**, do not erase catholic breadth. In contest with a simplistic binary of **evidentialism** versus **presuppositionalism**, Edgar contextualizes each approach within its doctrinal ecosystem, highlighting, for example, how **Aquinas’s natural theology** sits within a robust **doctrine of God**, and how **Calvin’s sense of divinity** intersects **Romans 1** and **general revelation**.

Edgar thereby advances his methodological thesis: **Reformed apologetics** does not fear the tradition but interrogates it through **Scripture**. He honors the instinct of **Van Til** to expose **autonomous reason**, yet he shows how, pastorally and historically, Christians have deployed **evidence**, **beauty**, and **moral witness** as handmaids to the gospel. This historical labor underwrites his own proposals in **Reasons of the Heart**, lending them a catholic legitimacy while anchoring them in **Westminster** commitments.

#### 5. Schaeffer, modernity, and the apologetic imagination
In **Schaeffer on the Christian Life: Countercultural Spirituality** 2013, Edgar offers a sympathetic but critical portrait of **Francis Schaeffer**. He agrees with Schaeffer that the church must address **modern and postmodern despair** in high culture, popular culture, and the everyday longings of persons. Edgar nuances Schaeffer by resisting too-quick genealogies from **Hegel** to **rock music**, yet he retains the call to gracious presence in the public square. This work radioes Edgar’s own commitments: apologetics is a mode of **discipleship**, **holiness**, and **love** for neighbor, not a standalone technique. By interpreting Schaeffer’s **countercultural spirituality**, Edgar bridges **Reformed orthodoxy** with a missional posture akin to **Harvie Conn’s urban mission** and **Kuyper’s cultural breadth**. The **doctrine of creation** is foregrounded, not to obscure the **cross**, but to situate redemption within a cosmos God still calls good.

Crucially, Edgar shows how **aesthetic judgment** and **artistic practice** can function apologetically. Echoing **Bavinck’s** insight that Christianity elevates culture by restoring nature, he locates the persuasive power of **beauty** in the doxological order of reality. Against both iconoclastic suspicion and uncritical embrace, Edgar proposes a **sacrificial discernment** that receives cultural forms under **soli Deo gloria**, seeking tributaries of **truth, goodness, and beauty** that run ultimately into the river of the **gospel**.

#### 6. Created and Creating: a biblical theology of culture
The monograph **Created and Creating: A Biblical Theology of Culture** 2016 distills Edgar’s cultural vision. Starting with **Genesis 1–2** and the **cultural mandate**, he argues that culture is not a postlapsarian concession but intrinsic to the vocation of the **imago Dei**. The **fall** distorts every sphere, intensifying the **antithesis** between idolatry and worship, yet **common grace** preserves structures and gifts so culture can be redirected toward **Christ**. Edgar reads the biblical narrative as a movement from **Eden** to **New Jerusalem**, where **kings bring their glory** into the city, indicating the eschatological transfiguration rather than annihilation of cultural goods. This yields a chastened transformationalism resistant both to **Anabaptist withdrawal** and to **Constantinian triumphalism**.

Edgar engages **H. Richard Niebuhr’s Christ and Culture** typology, appreciating the heuristic value while resisting its flattening of biblical tensions. He also addresses contemporary **two kingdoms** proposals, affirming a legitimate distinction of spheres while warning against a practical dualism that would evacuate **lordship of Christ** from ordinary vocations. The result is neither a blueprint for **Christian culture** nor a quietist retreat, but a practical **discernment** rooted in **Scripture**, **catholic tradition**, and **Reformed** instincts about **creation** and **covenant**.

#### 7. Jazz, lament, and hope: A Supreme Love
In **A Supreme Love: The Music of Jazz and the Hope of the Gospel** 2022, Edgar turns from theory to a case study in **aesthetic apologetics** and **common grace**. He argues that jazz, born amid the suffering and resilience of African American communities, manifests a grammar of **lament and hope** resonant with the **Psalms**, the **Exodus**, and the **gospel**. Improvisation becomes a musical analogue for human agency under **providence**, syncopation a sonic parable of joy amid brokenness, and call-and-response a communal enactment of **covenant** dialogue. Without baptizing every artifact, Edgar insists that **jazz** often carries a truthful anthropology and a deep moral energy that can be received, critiqued, and redirected for **worship** and **witness**.

This project displays Edgar’s conviction that **beauty** is not decorative but apologetically potent. By showing how **common grace** can yield works that point beyond themselves, he offers a public apologetic that is neither preachy nor evasive. The argument is historically attentive, theologically grounded, and pastorally sensitive to questions of **race**, **suffering**, and **justice**, so the **gospel** is heard as good news for actual communities, not merely as an abstract proposition. Within a **Reformed** frame, Edgar thus demonstrates how the arts can serve **mission** while deepening the church’s own **doxology**.

#### 8. Engaging modern and postmodern thought
Edgar’s European ties render him a canny reader of **modernity** and **postmodernity**. He engages **Camus** on the absurd, **Sartre** on freedom, and **Derrida** on différance, not to baptize them but to listen for the suppressed truth of **creation** and **judgment** their projects cannot silence. In **Reasons of the Heart** and many essays, he presses the **Romans 1** pattern: the unbelieving mind is brilliant yet internally conflicted, parasitic upon the order it denies. The remedy is not merely superior logic, but **regeneration**, which relocates knowing within **covenant** loyalty. Edgar therefore treats postmodern suspicion of **metanarratives** as both a critique to hear and a symptom to diagnose, answering with the **biblical story** that can carry the weight of human longing without crushing it.

At the same time, Edgar refuses to cede the public sphere by privatizing **faith**. He explores **natural law** carefully, discerning a place for **creational norms** evident to conscience, while reiterating the dangers of a freestanding **natural theology** that brackets **Trinity** and **incarnation**. This is Bavinckian: **grace restores nature**, not negates it, and in that restoration human reason and culture are neither idolized nor despised. The apologetic posture thus becomes one of confident hospitality, summoning neighbors into reality as **God’s world** truly is.

#### 9. Pedagogy, churchmanship, and the Reformed/WTS evaluation
As a longtime **Westminster Theological Seminary** professor, Edgar’s imprint is pedagogical as much as literary. His courses train students to read **texts**, hear **music**, and inhabit **cities** with covenantal discernment. The curricular arc mirrors his books: **Van Til’s antithesis**, **Pascal’s heart**, **Kuyper’s culture**, **Bavinck’s catholicity**, and **Schaeffer’s missionary posture**. He advocates for local church **worship** that is God-centered and for public **mission** that is patient, dialogical, and joyful. The result is a generation of pastors and apologists able to translate classical **Reformed doctrine** into living, public truth.

Reformed/WTS evaluation: Edgar’s synthesis of **covenantal apologetics** and **aesthetic persuasion** is a generative development within the **Westminster** trajectory, faithful to **Scripture**, **confession**, and **Van Til’s** central insight about **autonomous reason**. His retrieval of **Pascal** and his practice of **cultural engagement** enrich the Reformed account of **general revelation** and **common grace**, offering concrete strategies for witness in a fragmented age. Tensions remain. First, the emphasis on **persuasion** invites vigilance lest appeals to **beauty** or **moral intuition** function as soft **natural theologies** detached from the **covenant** economy. Second, in public theology, his Kuyperian optimism must be balanced by **two kingdoms** cautions about the limits of cultural transformation this side of **consummation**. Third, the celebration of **jazz** and the arts should be tethered to a thick **doctrine of worship** that resists liturgical pragmatism. Yet these cautions are intramural calibrations rather than defeaters. On balance, Edgar models a classically **Reformed** alternative to both culture-war belligerence and quietist retreat, showing how **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, and **history** converge in a persuasive, joyful **apologetic** under the lordship of **Christ**.
