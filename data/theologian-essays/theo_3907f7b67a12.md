- **Central categories**: **creation covenant**, **Abrahamic–Mosaic–Davidic–new covenant** sequence, **kingdom and new creation**, **typology** and *sensus plenior*, **grant and suzerain treaties**, **textual criticism** and **intertextuality**.
- **Interlocutors**: engagement with **Meredith G. Kline** and **O. Palmer Robertson** in Reformed **covenant theology**, with **Craig Blaising** and **Darrell Bock** in **progressive dispensationalism**, and with **G. K. Beale** and **Graeme Goldsworthy** on **biblical theology**.
- **Reformed reception cue**: strong on **Scripture’s unity**, **Christological typology**, and **kingdom**; contested on **covenant of works**, **law-gospel distinction**, **baptism and church**, **Sabbath and moral law**, and **Israel–church** continuity under **Westminster Confession** patterns.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The hallmark of **Peter J. Gentry** is the fusion of rigorous **philology** with whole-Bible **biblical theology**, a synthesis forged through expert work in the **Septuagint** and the **Hebrew Bible** and then deployed within the evangelical classroom at **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary**. Trained in the text-critical disciplines that map the **Masoretic Text** in dialogue with the **Greek Old Testament**, Gentry learned to prize the granularities of morphology, syntax, and discourse as the irreducible bedrock of theology. That bedrock anchors his broader method: a canonical storyline plotted by **covenants** and clarified by **typology**. The result is neither scholastic system-building nor thematic proof-texting, but an inductive architecture in which **kingdom**, **temple**, **image of God**, and **new creation** emerge from close reading. He resists a top-down metaphysical grid and instead pursues the *analogia fidei* through the grain of Scripture’s own **covenantal** texture.

A second defining feature is Gentry’s sustained attention to **ancient Near Eastern treaty** forms and comparative literature. The suzerain–vassal and royal grant patterns, long noted in the study of **Deuteronomy** and the **Davidic covenant**, become for Gentry an exegetical control on how biblical **covenants** function. This comparative lens is neither historicist nor reductionist; it is a guardrail that prevents abstractions detached from text. The intertextual mapping of **Torah**, **Prophets**, and **Writings** then supplies the typological logic by which earlier covenants are understood as **promissory and provisional**, moving toward **eschatological fulfillment** in **Christ** and the **new covenant**. The combined method is philological precision plus canonical pressure: a hermeneutic that insists that doctrine must be built from **Hebrew-Greek exegesis** to **biblical theology** to **systematics**, not the reverse.

#### 2. Kingdom through covenant: the thesis and its alternatives
The programmatic thesis appears in **Kingdom through Covenant** 2012, coauthored with **Stephen J. Wellum**, and revised in a robust **second edition** 2018. The book contends that the Bible’s unified plotline is best described as **God’s kingdom** advancing through a series of **covenants** that both reveal and realize God’s purposes. This proposal self-consciously positions itself against two well-known options: against classical **covenant theology** that structures Scripture under a pre-temporal **covenant of redemption** and a historical **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, and against **dispensationalism** that structures Scripture in successive **dispensations** with distinct economies. Gentry and Wellum’s via media is **progressive covenantalism**, a historical-covenantal sequence that emphasizes both continuity and discontinuity without a trans-historical **covenant of grace** or a multi-people-of-God **dispensational** framework. The anchor concepts throughout are **kingdom**, **covenant**, **typology**, and **new creation**.

The contrast with **Meredith G. Kline** and with **O. Palmer Robertson** is clarifying. Kline’s republication thesis and law-gospel dialectic under a **covenant of works** are critically engaged, while Robertson’s unifying **covenant of grace** is judged too synthetic for the variegated covenantal administrations. With **progressive dispensationalists** such as **Craig Blaising** and **Darrell Bock**, Gentry shares an insistence on one plan with stages, yet he resists a retained national-land promise in the church age. In short, **Kingdom through Covenant** proposes that the covenants are the textual joints by which Scripture moves from **creation** to **new creation**, and that ecclesiology and sacramentology must be reframed by the **new covenant**’s definitive character.

#### 3. The creation covenant and the image of God
A signal contribution is the articulation of a **creation covenant** in **Genesis 1–3**. Gentry argues that the priest-king vocation given to humanity as **image of God** constitutes a real covenant, even if the term berit is not used in the opening chapters. The appeal to **Hosea 6:7** and to ANE parallels strengthens the case that the **Adamic arrangement** is covenantal, establishing representative headship, royal vicegerency, and priestly temple-service. Yet this **creation covenant** is not cast as a merit-based **covenant of works** in the strict Westminster sense. Rather, it is a probationary arrangement ordered to life, communion, and eschatological Sabbath rest, later confirmed in **Christ** as last Adam. This shift reframes the **law-gospel** idiom: the protological structure is genuinely covenantal, but its soteriological horizons emerge typologically through the **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, and **Davidic** covenants toward the **new covenant**.

Within this frame, the **image of God** is rendered in royal-functional terms that are textually grounded: ruling, subduing, filling, and mediating God’s presence as temple-priests. The **kingdom** is therefore not an abstraction but a creation-anchored telos shared across covenants. The **Sabbath**, **land**, and **offspring** motifs function as typological threads: Eden as primal sanctuary, Canaan as provisional rest, Zion as royal-theological center, all moving toward **new creation**. This Eden-to-Zion-to-New Jerusalem movement is the grammar of **Gentry’s biblical theology**, and it undergirds later arguments about **baptism**, **people of God**, and the **church**.

#### 4. Abraham, Sinai, David, and the new covenant as progressive architecture
Gentry’s covenantal architecture works by careful attention to the particular form and function of each major covenant. The **Abrahamic covenant** is unilateral and promissory, yet it entails responsive obedience and a widening typology around **seed** and **land**. The **Mosaic covenant** is suzerain-vassal in shape, creating a constitution for a priestly nation whose sacrificial and legal structures are both revelatory and temporary. The **Davidic covenant** is a royal grant that gathers **Abrahamic** and **Mosaic** streams into a messianic channel focused on sonship and kingdom. Finally, the **new covenant** promised in **Jeremiah 31** and enacted in **Christ** is definitive and transformative, generating a regenerate people and an internalized law by the **Spirit**.

Across this sequence, **typology** is not free association but text-traced correspondence in terms of escalation and fulfillment. For **land**, the move is from Edenic geography to Abrahamic Canaan to **Zion** to the **new creation** of **Revelation 21–22**. For **seed**, the move is from corporate Israel to royal **Messiah** to a multinational family in **Christ**. For **law**, the trajectory is from codified stipulations under **Sinai** to the **Spirit**-wrought obedience of the **new covenant** community. Gentry insists that these developments should steer **ecclesiology** and **sacramentology**, so that the **church** is the regenerate, Spirit-indwelt people of the **new covenant**, and **baptism** is a new covenant sign tied to union with **Christ**, not a genealogical-administrative sign applied to believers’ children.

#### 5. Prophetic hermeneutics: reading eschatology by genre and intertext
Gentry’s shorter monograph, **How to Read and Understand the Biblical Prophets** 2017, distills his hermeneutical commitments into guidance on **prophetic literature**. He emphasizes **genre**, **poetic parallelism**, **metaphor**, and **macro-structure** as the crucial keys to prophetic meaning. The prophetic idiom trades in stock imagery and covenant lawsuit patterns that must be read in the light of **Torah** and the covenant sanctions of **Leviticus 26** and **Deuteronomy 28–32**. This yields a sensitive account of prophetic **eschatology** that honors both near-horizon fulfillments and ultimate **new creation** consummation without collapsing either. The result is a disciplined **typology** where prophetic promise functions by escalation and transformation rather than by flat prediction-fulfillment equivalences.

This prophetic hermeneutic carries two implications for debates with **dispensationalism** and **covenant theology**. Against a wooden literalism, Gentry argues that prophetic **land** and **temple** language climaxes in **Christ** and the **church** as the eschatological temple by the **Spirit**. Against an overly static law-gospel dichotomy, he reads prophetic hope as covenantal restoration enfolding **law** within **grace**, culminating in **Jeremiah 31** and **Ezekiel 36–37**. These moves are grounded in **textual criticism** and careful attention to the Hebrew poetic line rather than in prior system commitments. The anchors remain **covenant**, **kingdom**, **temple**, and **new creation**.

#### 6. Textual criticism and the Septuagint as theological tools
Gentry’s expertise in the **Septuagint** informs his reading of **Old Testament** theology and the **New Testament**’s use of the Old. The **Greek Old Testament** is not merely a witness to a Vorlage but a literary and theological artifact that shapes early Christian **intertextuality**. Gentry’s essays and teaching parse how **quotation**, **allusion**, and **echo** operate when the **New Testament** cites or alludes to the **Old** through **Greek** renderings that sometimes diverge from the **Masoretic Text**. This does not destabilize authority; for Gentry it highlights God’s providential communication across textual forms and supports a robust account of *sensus plenior* disciplined by original **Hebrew** contexts and covenantal development.

The upshot for **biblical theology** is significant. Text-critical sensitivity allows Gentry to offer nuanced readings of crucial passages such as the **Servant Songs** in **Isaiah**, the **new covenant** in **Jeremiah**, and the **Psalms**’ royal-messianic portfolio, tracing how **Christ** reconfigures their horizons without eviscerating their original historical force. Here the method remains consistent: **philology** first, **intertext** second, **typology** third, and **systematic** synthesis only last. Theological conclusions about **atonement**, **kingdom**, and **people of God** are presented as warranted by this layered reading strategy anchored in the **covenant** sequence.

#### 7. Ecclesiology, sacraments, and the people of God
One of the most debated outcomes of **Gentry** and **Wellum’s** project concerns **ecclesiology** and **baptism**. By arguing that the **new covenant** people are definitively **regenerate**, constituted by the **Spirit**’s internal work and united to **Christ**, they resist reading the **new covenant** as an administrative continuation of **Abrahamic** household inclusion. Consequently, **baptism** is tethered to **new covenant** realities like union with **Christ** and reception of the **Spirit**, which implies **credobaptism**. The **Lord’s Supper** is similarly framed as participation in the **new covenant** community’s life, not merely a covenantal badge for a mixed visible church defined by genealogical markers.

This ecclesial vision reshapes **Israel–church** relations. The typological trajectory from **Israel** to **Christ** to the **church** is not replacement but fulfillment, with **land**, **temple**, and **priesthood** themes transformed in **Messiah** and extended to a multi-ethnic body. This resists **progressive dispensationalism**’s expectation of a restored national polity under a distinct covenant arrangement, even while acknowledging future salvation for **ethnic Israel** within the one **new covenant**. The stakes are high: **kingdom** and **covenant** define the church’s identity and mission, and **Gentry’s** exegetical commitments drive the ecclesiological conclusions.

#### 8. Interlocutors, reception, and disciplinary contribution
Across debates, **Gentry** positions his work with candor. With **Meredith G. Kline**, he agrees on **covenant** centrality and on ANE comparative method, but he questions the theological freight of a **covenant of works** and the exact shape of **republication**. With **O. Palmer Robertson**, he shares a covenantal instinct yet demurs at a single **covenant of grace** umbrella. With **Craig Blaising** and **Darrell Bock**, he shares progressive staging but rejects retaining national **land** as a distinct eschatological stratum in the **church** age. Constructively, he aligns with **Graeme Goldsworthy** and **G. K. Beale** on **kingdom** and **temple** as hermeneutical keys, though his route to those conclusions is more **philological** and **text-critical**.

The broader evangelical reception has been vigorous. The 2012 **Kingdom through Covenant** launched the label **progressive covenantalism**, stimulating conferences, responses, and a **second edition** 2018 addressing critiques on **typology**, **baptism**, and the **Mosaic law**. The popular-level **God’s Kingdom through God’s Covenants** 2015 expanded the audience, while **How to Read and Understand the Biblical Prophets** 2017 equipped pastors to read **prophecy** without collapsing metaphor into literalism or erasing historical horizons. Taken together, Gentry’s oeuvre demonstrates the fruitfulness of marrying **Septuagintal studies**, **textual criticism**, and **covenantal biblical theology** for the sake of **systematic theology** performed from below.

#### 9. Doctrinal payoffs and systematic interface
The doctrinal harvest of **Gentry’s** approach includes a rich rearticulation of **kingdom** as God’s rule realized through **covenant** and embodied in **Christ**, a robust account of **typology** that honors historical particularity and eschatological escalation, and a coherent reading of **law** under **Sinai** fulfilled and transformed in the **new covenant**. His handling of the **image of God**, **Sabbath rest**, and **temple** yields a thick **new creation** eschatology that informs discipleship and mission. Because the **covenants** are treated as the Bible’s architectural joints, doctrines of **Christology**, **atonement**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramentology** are rebuilt in covenantal key. The result is a canonical map that is exegetically rich and pastorally directed, a biblical theology that makes visible how **texts** become **doctrine** and how **history** becomes **eschatology**.

At the same time, the interface with **systematic theology** raises questions. Without a trans-historical **covenant of grace**, one must articulate the unity of **redemption** across covenants solely in terms of typological promise-fulfillment; without a strong **law-gospel** contrast, one must guard the gratuity of grace even as **law** remains covenantally integral; without **paedobaptism**, one must explain the inclusion of children within the visible **church**. Gentry’s answer is to maintain soteriological unity in **Christ** while letting covenantal administrations differ, to stress **Spirit**-formed obedience under the **new covenant**, and to focus on a regenerate **church** constituted by **faith** rather than lineage. The strength of the proposal is its textual rootedness; its challenge is ensuring catholic coherence across loci.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, **Peter J. Gentry** offers genuine gains and some acute tensions. Positively, his emphasis on **covenant** as Scripture’s grammar accords with the **Westminster Confession of Faith**’s pervasive covenantal outlook, his **typology** intensifies **Christological** focus, and his **kingdom–temple–new creation** axis revitalizes **eschatology**. His **Septuagint** and **textual criticism** work models how high doctrine can rest on low-level textual fidelity, a virtue every **Reformed** exegete should emulate. Yet two structural frictions persist. First, the downplaying of a formal **covenant of works** risks blurring the **law–gospel** distinction that safeguards the gratuity of **grace** and underwrites **justification** by faith apart from works. Second, the denial of a single **covenant of grace** as an administrative umbrella complicates the **unity of the church** across epochs and weakens the traditional case for **paedobaptism**, **moral law** permanence, and **Sabbath** continuity. A Westminster alternative would retain Gentry’s **philological** discipline and his **typology**, but integrate them within a two-covenant schema where the **covenant of works** under **Adam** provides the forensic backdrop for **Christ’s** active and passive obedience, the **covenant of grace** secures one people across administrations, and the **Mosaic law** is Threefold in its moral-ceremonial-judicial distinctions. On **Israel–church** relations, a Reformed reading can appropriate Gentry’s **kingdom** telos while insisting that **land** and **temple** typology vindicates not a narrowed church but an enlarged catholicity under one **covenant of grace**. In sum, Gentry’s progressive covenantalism is a salutary exegetical provocation that Reformed theology can welcome, sift, and, at points, counterpoise with classical **federal** categories.
