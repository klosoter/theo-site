### ESSAY
The contemporary evangelical landscape has witnessed a marked turn toward **evangelical ressourcement**, a constructive retrieval of the **Church Fathers** to steady a community long suspicious of tradition. Within this horizon, Bryan Litfin has emerged as a confident and readable guide to **Nicene-Chalcedonian orthodoxy**, translating patristic voices into the idiom of modern **sola Scriptura** faith. Trained as a historian of early Christianity and teaching for many years at **Moody Bible Institute** in Chicago, Litfin writes with the dual aim of historical clarity and ecclesial edification. His work participates in a broader evangelical renaissance shaped by figures such as **Robert Louis Wilken**, **D. H. Williams**, and **Thomas Oden**, yet he distinguishes himself by combining careful primary-source engagement with pastoral instruction aimed at catechesis, mission, and the lived plausibility of orthodox doctrine.

Litfin’s formation within American **evangelicalism** gives him an instinct for the strengths and the vulnerabilities of a Bible-centered movement. He is alert to the danger of **solo Scriptura**, the isolated individual’s reading unmoored from the church’s **regula fidei**, while he sharply defends the Protestant conviction of **Scripture’s sufficiency**. This dual allegiance informs his method: the **consensus patrum** is received as a ministerial norm that tutors the church to hear the canon on its own terms, not as a rival magisterium that legislates new dogma. He reads with sympathetic criticism, granting to **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, **Tertullian**, **Chrysostom**, and **Augustine** a legitimate voice precisely because they stand close to the defining moments of **Trinitarian** and **Christological** confession. At the same time, he models a historian’s restraint about later accretions and legendary expansions that cannot bear doctrinal weight.

#### 1. Method: regula fidei, canon recognition, and historical sympathy
Litfin’s epistemic posture can be summarized as a triangulation of **regula fidei**, **canon recognition**, and **historical sympathy**. The **regula fidei** functions as a pre-critical summary of apostolic teaching, theologically crystallized in the **creeds** and liturgically enacted in catechesis and baptism. The **canon** is not invented by the church but recognized due to its apostolic origin, divine qualities, and catholic usage, a stance that coheres with evangelical claims about **biblical authority**. **Historical sympathy** means he refuses anachronism, allowing patristic categories such as *homoousios* and *theosis* to speak without reduction, even as he assesses them in light of evangelical convictions about **grace**, **atonement**, and **mission**. In this triad, the fathers become partners in exegesis and theology, not museum pieces or ecclesial regulators.

#### 2. Getting to Know the Church Fathers, 2007 and 2016
With **Getting to Know the Church Fathers** in 2007, revised in 2016, Litfin crafted his signature work of evangelical introduction. The book provides concise portraits of key figures such as **Ignatius of Antioch**, **Polycarp**, **Justin Martyr**, **Irenaeus of Lyons**, **Tertullian**, **Origen**, **Athanasius**, **Cappadocians**, **John Chrysostom**, and **Augustine**, situating them within the crucible of persecution, doctrinal conflict, and imperial transformation. Litfin distills the substance of **Nicene Trinitarianism** and **Chalcedonian Christology**, attends to the emergence of **creedal confession**, and clarifies the pastoral stakes of doctrines such as **incarnation**, **atonement**, and **deification**. Against evangelical reductionism, he shows how the fathers interpreted Scripture with a confident sense of **canonical unity**, employing **typology** and **rule-guided exegesis**. Against repristination, he notes the limits and missteps of figures like **Origen**, encouraging a discerning appropriation that is normed by **Scripture**. The result is a manual for evangelical readers who seek to be catholic without abandoning **Reformation** identity.

#### 3. Early Christian Martyr Stories, 2014
In **Early Christian Martyr Stories** in 2014, Litfin offers an evangelical gateway to texts such as the **Martyrdom of Polycarp**, the **Passion of Perpetua and Felicity**, the **Acts of the Scillitan Martyrs**, and the **Letter of the Churches of Lyons and Vienne**. His translations, introductions, and notes exhibit a blend of philological care and theological insight. He distinguishes between probative eyewitness testimony and later hagiographic embroidery, mindful of sources like **Eusebius’s Ecclesiastical History** and the rhetorical conventions of ancient biography. Theologically, he highlights how martyrdom functions as **witness** to the crucified and risen Lord, how it shapes corporate identity through **baptismal** and **Eucharistic** practices, and how it embodies **discipleship** under persecution. He resists romanticizing suffering or endorsing voluntarist extremes, yet he retrieves the ancient grammar of **imitation Christi**, showing evangelicals how sanctification and mission were forged under the sign of the cross. In this work, pastoral formation integrates with historical sobriety, where the church’s memory of faithful dying renews the church’s courage for faithful living.

#### 4. After Acts, 2015: apostles, legend, and the bounds of history
With **After Acts: Exploring the Lives and Legends of the Apostles** in 2015, Litfin tackles a fraught field where devotion and legend intermingle. He surveys **Peter** and **Paul** in Rome, the contested mission of **Thomas** in India, the itineraries attached to **Andrew**, **Bartholomew**, and **John**, and the developing traditions concerning **Mary**. His method differentiates early credible testimony, such as the likely martyrdoms of Peter and Paul attested by **Clement of Rome** and **Eusebius**, from the imaginative worlds of the **Acts of Peter**, **Acts of Paul and Thecla**, **Acts of John**, and **Acts of Thomas**. By weighing manuscript traditions, geographical plausibility, and theological tendencies, he guides evangelical readers to an anchored assessment of what can and cannot be claimed. The upshot is twofold: first, an account of apostolic mission that respects the constraints of historical inquiry, and second, a catechesis in how the early church constructed memory and identity around **apostolic authority**, **canon formation**, and **succession** without collapsing history into fiction or conflating fidelity with credulity.

#### 5. Core doctrinal themes: Trinity, Christology, Scripture and tradition
Across his corpus, Litfin advances evangelical clarity on **Trinity**, **Christology**, and the **Scripture-tradition** relation. He embraces the fathers’ insistence on the **homoousios** of the Son with the Father, the inseparable operations of the **Trinitarian persons**, and the **hypostatic union** of Christ defined at **Chalcedon**. He recognizes the breadth of patristic **atonement** metaphors, from **recapitulation** in **Irenaeus** to **Christus Victor**, while maintaining that substitution and satisfaction language has biblical warrant and doctrinal utility for evangelicals. On Scripture and tradition, he regularly articulates **sola Scriptura vs solo Scriptura**, insisting that the church’s creeds and fathers are interpretive guides whose authority is derivative and whose usefulness remains great. He invites evangelicals to take up the **Nicene Creed** and the **Apostles Creed** as catechetical norms that safeguard biblical reading and ecclesial proclamation.

#### 6. Churchly practices and the shape of discipleship
Litfin’s retrieval reaches beyond doctrine to practices that formed early Christian life. He treats **catechesis**, the **catechumenate**, and the structure of **baptismal confession** as missional pathways by which the gospel burrowed into Greco-Roman cultures. He describes the early **Eucharist** with sobriety, noting the fathers’ realistic language about the presence of Christ while declining to enlist their rhetoric for late medieval metaphysics. He favors a historically honest picture of **episcopacy**, showing how forms of monoepiscopacy arose and how synodal deliberation served the church’s unity, yet he refrains from binding such patterns on evangelical churches as if they were transhistorical law. His point is pedagogical: evangelical churches require a thicker theology of belonging and worship, and the ancient disciplines can tutor them in **holiness**, **hospitality**, and **mission** without displacing their confessional commitments to **Scripture**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and the ecology of evangelical retrieval
Litfin’s work is best understood alongside a generation of evangelical retrieval projects. With **Thomas Oden’s** paleo-orthodoxy and **Christopher Hall’s** series on reading with the fathers, he shares the conviction that the **Great Tradition** offers an ecumenical trellis for evangelical growth. With **D. H. Williams**, he warns against the modern prejudice that identifies tradition with Roman or Eastern exclusivity and urges evangelicals to recognize their share in **catholicity**. He also stands over against skeptical treatments of early Christianity represented in the public square by voices like **Bart Ehrman**, where textual or historical anomalies are leveraged to undermine orthodox confidence. On the other hand, he engages sober conservative work on **canon recognition** and **self-authentication**, a trajectory represented in Reformed circles by scholars such as **Michael Kruger**, to affirm that the church’s reception of Scripture rests ultimately on divine authority, not ecclesial fiat. These conversations frame his consistent appeal to the **regula fidei** as a faithful guide without becoming a rival rule.

#### 8. Style, pedagogy, and the role of imagination
A notable feature of Litfin’s profile is his pastoral pedagogy and use of narrative imagination. Even his historical fiction, such as the **Chiveis Trilogy** published from 2010 to 2012, should be read as an experiment in **catechesis** through story, where themes of **faith under persecution**, **covenantal loyalty**, and **the cost of discipleship** are dramatized for evangelical readers. This imaginative work complements his academic volumes by cultivating a sensibility that gravitates toward the ancient church’s rhythms of **Scripture reading**, **prayer**, and **sacramental life**. He understands that doctrinal retrieval without ecclesial formation yields thin outcomes, and he therefore crafts prose that invites churches and students to inhabit the grammar of **Nicene faith**.

#### 9. Contribution summed: an evangelical catechist of the fathers
The upshot of Litfin’s project is a credible pathway by which evangelicals can claim the **Church Fathers** as their own while remaining doggedly committed to **biblical sufficiency**. He brings the **martyrs** into view as models of hope, the **apostles** into focus as historical and theological anchors, and the **creeds** into the sanctuary as apprenticeships in right praise. He disarms the false alternative between **free church biblicism** and **magisterial traditionalism** by exhibiting a historically serious, canon-centered, and pastorally oriented movement between **Scripture** and **tradition**. His readers are instructed to receive the gifts of **Irenaeus**, **Athanasius**, and **Augustine** without mistaking them for the voice of the Lord, to value **episcopal** and synodal prudence without deriding congregational forms, and to embrace **sacramental** depth without surrendering evangelical clarity about **grace**.

In a Reformed and Westminster Seminary evaluation, Litfin’s retrieval aligns with the core of **classical Reformed orthodoxy** on **Scripture’s self-attesting authority**, the priority of the **covenant of grace** in reading redemptive history, and the normativity of **Nicene-Chalcedonian** dogma. His rejection of **solo Scriptura** and his embrace of the ministerial **regula fidei** resonate with confessional appeals to subordinate standards. Tensions emerge where the gravitational pull of the **Great Tradition** might be construed to normalize early **episcopacy**, elevate patristic **sacramental realism** beyond Reformed convictions about the means of grace, or treat consensuality as a quasi-canon alongside Scripture. A Reformed alternative would press the primacy of **covenantal exegesis**, the **self-authenticating canon** with its divine qualities, and the derivative authority of the **creeds** within confessional boundaries, urging that patristic insights be received as edifying yet corrigible by the Word. On balance, Litfin offers a salutary corrective to anti-historical biblicism, a faithful invitation to read **Scripture with the fathers**, and a usable model of evangelical **ressourcement** that Reformed theology can affirm while carefully delimiting tradition’s scope.
