### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Born in 1944, **Langdon Winner** emerged as a leading voice in the American **political theory of technology** as the postwar settlement gave way to an era of **large technical systems**, **nuclear infrastructure**, and cybernetic governance. The cultural context of **Cold War technocracy**, the 1970s **energy crisis**, and the legacy of the **Free Speech Movement** at Berkeley supplied both the empirical field and the democratic ethos for his work. Educated in political science and long based at **Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute** in an STS setting, Winner absorbed themes from **Heidegger** on **Gestell**, from **Jacques Ellul** on **la technique**, and from **Lewis Mumford** on urban-technological civilization. He positioned himself not as a theological voice but as a public philosopher seeking to retrieve political judgment in a world where devices, systems, and infrastructures structure what citizens can do. This aim unfolds across **Autonomous Technology** 1977, **Do Artifacts Have Politics?** 1980, and **The Whale and the Reactor** 1986, each building a normative vocabulary for the thesis that the **non-neutrality of technology** is a constitutional matter for modern polities.

Winner’s method is explicitly normative yet empirically literate. He resists the false choice between **instrumentalism** technology as neutral means and **technological determinism** technology as an independent fate. He crafts a middle path he calls **technological politics**, arguing that artifacts and systems can be imbued with and even require distinctive **forms of power and authority**. His epistemic stance is pragmatic and realist about material constraints while alert to social construction. Concepts are tested against case studies and historical episodes to show how **material form**, **systemic interdependence**, and **political order** interlock. The result is neither metaphysical pessimism about **modernity** nor technophilic apologetic, but a call to democratic deliberation about the **moral constitution of our artifacts**.

#### 2. Autonomous Technology: out-of-control as a political theme
In **Autonomous Technology** 1977, Winner reconstructs the genealogy of **out-of-control technics** as a motif in modern political thought. He reads myths of **Frankenstein**, images of the **Golem**, Marxian analyses of **capital as self-valorizing automaton**, and twentieth-century anxieties about **automation** as a continuous meditation on political agency displaced into machines. The crucial claim is that autonomy is not metaphysical independence of machines but the emergent autonomy of **socio-technical systems** whose momentum, complexity, sunk costs, and institutional commitments make reversal politically prohibitive. The autonomy of technology is thus a problem of **governance** and **virtue**: once entrenched, systems generate path dependencies that narrow the feasible space of human choice and relocate authority into technical procedures.

Winner avoids the fatalism of hard **technological determinism** while still insisting on the morally weighty phenomenon of **systemic lock-in**. The book argues that political communities must learn to see the **design and deployment of technology** as a site of constitutional decision. Questions such as centralization versus decentralization, human oversight versus automation, and open standards versus proprietary control are not mere engineering options but matters of **civic liberty**, **participation**, and **justice**. Autonomy, on this reading, is nothing other than unacknowledged sovereignty migrating from citizens and legislatures to **algorithms**, **control rooms**, and **networks**. That shift calls for a public philosophy adequate to restrain, steer, or sometimes refuse the momentum of particular technological ensembles.

#### 3. Do artifacts have politics? Two senses of technological non-neutrality
The essay **Do Artifacts Have Politics?** 1980 crystallizes Winner’s most famous thesis. He proposes two senses in which artifacts can be political. First, certain **technological arrangements** are strongly compatible with, or practically require, particular **forms of social organization**. Classic examples are **nuclear power** with its demand for centralized, hierarchical control and vigilant secrecy versus **solar energy** compatible with dispersed, participatory arrangements. Second, during their design and adoption, technologies can be intentionally or inadvertently configured to favor some users and exclude others, thus embodying **political decisions**. Winner’s contested example of **Robert Moses’ low overpasses** on Long Island limiting bus access and the case of the **mechanized tomato harvester** displacing small farmers illustrate how design choices can structure inequity.

The point is not to deny interpretive flexibility but to insist that **materiality bites**. Infrastructures are not blank canvases; they carry inertia, affordances, and externalities that reshape human association. By arguing for **inherently political technologies** in some limited cases, Winner resists the evacuation of normativity that comes from treating every technical choice as socially malleable. He urges the recovery of **public judgment** that asks before the fact which institutional forms, civic virtues, and distributive outcomes a technology will stabilize. The essay thereby reframes technology as constitutional law by other means and invites citizens to contest the **politics of artifacts** before infrastructures naturalize their order.

#### 4. The Whale and the Reactor: somnambulism and the call to public philosophy
In **The Whale and the Reactor** 1986, Winner pursues the theme of **technological somnambulism**: modern societies sleepwalk into deeply consequential technical environments without awake deliberation. He argues that technical change is never merely incremental; it reconstitutes the meanings of **work**, **community**, **citizenship**, and **nature**. The titular image contrasts the **whale** as emblem of living limits with the **nuclear reactor** as emblem of high-energy modernity, posing a question of **prudence** and **scale**. Winner advances an ethics that grants technologies a quasi-constitutional status, calling for institutions of **public inquiry** and **participatory design** capable of asking not only can we build this but should we and under what political terms.

Within this frame, Winner rehabilitates an **epistemological luddism** not as vandalism but as the civic right to slow down, to break open black boxes, to test claims, and to rebuild norms in light of technical novelty. He seeks a citizen competence to evaluate **risk**, **equity**, and **reversibility**, arguing that democratic polities must institutionalize foresight. The book thus links the micro-politics of devices with the macro-constitution of society, urging that the **foundational virtues of a republic** adapt to the constraints and possibilities of contemporary technics. Its normative accent is on cultivating institutions that resist **expertocratic closure**, recover **public reason**, and honor the moral significance of **limits**.

#### 5. Debating STS: constructivism, actor-networks, and the empty black box
As **Science and Technology Studies** matured, Winner engaged its **social constructivist** wing and the rise of **actor-network theory**. In **Upon Opening the Black Box and Finding It Empty** 1993, he faulted strands of **SCOT** for methodological bracketing that, while brilliant at tracing negotiations, withdrew from substantive normative assessment of the outcomes. The black box, once opened, yielded a method but not a polity. He also resisted the levelling impulse in **Latourian** accounts that flatten distinctions between human and non-human actors, worrying that political responsibility vanishes in a generalized network.

Winner’s counterproposal is a **public philosophy of technology** that integrates empirical sociologies with strong political evaluation. He accepts the anti-essentialist lesson that artifacts are made by people in institutions, but he insists that once made, **material artifacts** and **large technical systems** impose asymmetric burdens and enable durable power. Against relativism, he defends **evaluative criteria** such as inclusion, accountability, resilience, and justice. Against determinism, he preserves **agency**, hoping that citizens can still refuse, redirect, or redesign technical trajectories through institutions suited to the scale of the systems in question.

#### 6. Comparisons: Heidegger, Ellul, Mumford, and the moderation of substantivism
Winner aligns with **Heidegger** and **Ellul** in rejecting **instrumentalism**, acknowledging that modern technics disclose a world under the rule of **Gestell** and **la technique**. Yet he moderates their **substantivism**. Where **Heidegger** tends toward ontological critique of Western metaphysics and **Ellul** toward cultural monism about technique’s autonomy, Winner reframes the question in **political** and **institutional** terms. The problem is less a metaphysical destiny than the consolidation of **power** in particular socio-technical regimes. In this he shares a practical orientation with **Lewis Mumford** and later dialogues with **Albert Borgmann** on the **device paradigm** and **Andrew Feenberg** on **democratic rationalization**.

The moderation matters. By recognizing both the shaping force of material form and the contested space of design, Winner avoids despair and keeps open the path of reform. His controversial category of **inherently political technologies** is narrow but crucial. Some systems not only can be used for domination; they demand it to work at all. The difference between **nuclear command-and-control** and **distributed renewables**, or between **closed, proprietary platforms** and **open protocols**, is not merely cultural overlay but embedded **constitutional choice**. This insistence advances a more discriminating ethics than generic warnings about modernity.

#### 7. Implications for moral theology: power, liturgies, and common life
Although not writing as a theologian, Winner’s categories reenter theological ethics wherever churches assess **technology, power, and creaturely limits**. The thesis that **artifacts have politics** dovetails with accounts of **idolatry** in which tools become **principalities and powers** shaping desire and loyalty. The account of **technological somnambulism** exposes how everyday **device liturgies** catechize persons into rival visions of the good. His call for **public judgment** resonates with traditions that prize **prudence**, **solidarity**, and **subsidiarity**, while his insistence on **limits** interrogates a soteriology of boundless mastery.

For theological anthropology, Winner’s attention to how infrastructures configure agency illuminates debates about the **imago Dei** and **dominion**. If dominion is vocational stewardship, then choices among **centralized** or **decentralized** systems, **opaque** or **transparent** algorithms, are not technical trivia but moral acts that sculpt the possibilities of neighbor love. His differentiation between technologies that admit **democratic oversight** and those that structurally resist it sharpens ecclesial discourse on **prudential refusal**, the hard but sometimes necessary no to seductive systems that demand disproportionate sacrifice of justice or community.

#### 8. Legacy and contemporary salience: platforms, AI, and infrastructure justice
The legacy of **Langdon Winner** is twofold: a lexicon for recognizing the **constitutional weight of technology** and a civic posture of **wakeful deliberation**. His theses animate debates in **engineering ethics**, **infrastructure studies**, and **public policy**, where scholars and practitioners assess **platform governance**, **algorithmic accountability**, **surveillance capitalism**, and **smart city** design. The categories of **inherently political technologies** and **technological somnambulism** help interpret the political economy of **cloud computing**, the centralizing drift of **AI compute regimes**, the labor politics of **gig platforms**, and the equity stakes of **urban mobility** systems.

Critics have targeted particular case studies, especially the **Robert Moses bridges** claim, yet the broader point survives: design and system architecture can exclude as effectively as law. Contemporary controversies over **facial recognition**, **predictive policing**, and **content moderation** instantiate the same insight. The question, as Winner asks, is whether we will foreclose debate through faits accomplis or legislate and design in light of principles that honor **justice**, **accountability**, and **human dignity**.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation: covenantal stewardship against technicism
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Winner’s corpus offers rich proximate wisdom while needing covenantal grounding. Positively, his rejection of **instrumental neutrality** coheres with **Kuyperian** and **Dooyeweerdian** critiques of **technicism**, and his discernment that **artifacts have politics** maps onto the **structure-direction** distinction: the good creational structure of technology can be directed toward idolatrous domination or toward service in love. His call to awake from **technological somnambulism** parallels **Van Til’s** antithesis between autonomous pretension and **covenantal** obedience, urging churches to test spirits and systems. Moreover, his attentiveness to **scale**, **centralization**, and **opacity** complements **sphere sovereignty**, warning when technical systems usurp the competencies of household, church, school, or polis.

Yet the account of **autonomous technology** risks, at points, an ontological aura that blurs human responsibility and divine providence. Without the teleology of **creation-fall-redemption** and the norming authority of **special revelation**, criteria for judging technologies hover between procedural democracy and prudential sentiment about limits. A Reformed alternative would retain Winner’s political acumen while rooting evaluation in **covenant law**, **natural law rightly interpreted**, and the **cultural mandate** under Christ’s lordship. Technologies should be judged by how they serve **God’s glory**, **neighbor’s good**, and **Sabbath-shaped limits**, not only by participatory form. That standard often converges with Winner’s democratic preference for **decentralized, accountable systems**, but it also supplies grounds for principled refusal where systems require injustice, as well as gratitude where common grace yields tools answerable to truth and charity. In sum, Reformed theology can baptize Winner’s **technological politics** into a doxological **stewardship** that disenchants autonomy, disciplines power by covenant, and reorients design toward the peace of the city under the kingship of Christ.
