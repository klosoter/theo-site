### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context: Particular Baptists under Enlightenment pressure
Born in 1754 in Wicken, Cambridgeshire, **Andrew Fuller** was ordained among **Particular Baptists** at Soham in 1774 and then called to **Kettering** in 1782, where he remained until his death in 1815. His early ministry unfolded amid a withering of Baptist vitality under **Hyper-Calvinism** and the destabilizing currents of the **Enlightenment**. The heirs of **John Gill** and **John Brine** often suppressed invitations to faith, doubting the **free offer of the gospel** as inconsistent with **particular redemption**. Across the Midlands, **Socinian** and **Unitarian** rational Dissent, represented by **Joseph Priestley** and later **Thomas Belsham**, contested **Christ’s deity** and **penal substitution**, pressing a moralistic reading of Scripture’s narrative. The Northamptonshire Baptist circle that gathered around Fuller, including **John Ryland Jr.**, **John Sutcliff**, and the future missionary **William Carey**, sought to retrieve a practical **evangelical Calvinism** that could withstand **Enlightenment rationalism** while dissolving High Calvinist inertia regarding **means of grace** and **mission**.

Fuller’s intellectual formation was deeply marked by **Puritan** divinity and the **New England** theologian **Jonathan Edwards**. From Edwards he learned an affective account of faith and virtue, drawing on the Freedom of the Will to develop the distinction between **moral inability** and **natural inability**. From **John Owen** and the **Second London Confession** of 1689 he imbibed **particular grace**, **effectual calling**, and **union with Christ**, while resisting the High Calvinist refusal to press the **gospel call** upon all. The prevailing context was a three-front struggle: overcoming Baptist **antinomianism**, answering **rationalist** challenges to revealed **Christology** and **atonement**, and mobilizing churches for the **Great Commission** in a culture suspicious of religious enthusiasm.

#### 2. Method: Scripture first, read through an Edwardsian moral psychology
Fuller’s method was stubbornly **biblicist**, but never biblicist in the thin sense of isolated proof-texting. He read Scripture by the **analogia fidei**, locating texts in the whole counsel of God’s **redemptive-historical** plan and assessing doctrinal proposals by their **moral tendency**. This latter phrase, prominent in **The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems Examined and Compared** 1793, signals a conviction that evangelical doctrine remakes persons through the **affections**, whereas anti-trinitarian schemes dissolve the **fear of God** and thus the very **ethics** they promise. Here Fuller is **Edwardsian**: religion is not bare assent but a God-wrought **holy disposition**, a renewed taste for **divine glory**, a transformation of the will rather than a mere inference of the understanding.

At the same time, Fuller deployed scholastic distinctions to prevent confusion. The central one is **moral vs natural inability**. Natural inability refers to physical or intellectual incapacity. Moral inability names the sinner’s culpable aversion to God. Hence the legitimacy of **duty-faith**: inability does not cancel duty because the inability is ethical and voluntary. He frequently framed the gospel’s warrant in the maxim **sufficienter omnibus, efficienter electis**. The sufficiency of **Christ’s atonement** grounds the universal command and invitation, while the Spirit’s **effectual calling** secures infallible saving application to the elect. This method let Fuller refute **Sandemanianism** for reducing **faith** to naked assent and reject **Hyper-Calvinism** for refusing the **free offer** on the false assumption that duty requires natural ability.

#### 3. Duty-faith and the free offer: The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation
Fuller’s classic, **The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation** first edition 1785 and enlarged second edition 1801, sought to move Particular Baptists from paralysis to proclamation. Its thesis was precise: because the gospel reveals **Christ’s all-sufficiency** and commands all who hear to repent and believe, it is the immediate duty of every sinner to trust Christ, and ministers must indiscriminately call all to faith. The first edition leveled **Hyper-Calvinism**, showing from Scripture that universal invitations are intrinsic to apostolic preaching. The 1801 edition added a constructive section on the **use of means**, arguing that God ordains the preaching of **law and gospel**, prayer, and missionary labor as instruments by which the Spirit conquers **moral inability**.

Central to the argument is Fuller’s rehabilitation of **warrant of faith**. The warrant is not introspective signs of election but the objective **promise** and **command** of God in the gospel, together with the infinite worth of **Christ’s person** and work. Here he employed the Edwardsian account of the will to insist that sinners do not lack natural powers to believe, but lack the holy **taste** for God. Because this lack is **moral**, the command stands, and because the Spirit bestows the new taste in **regeneration**, the command is not futile. Fuller’s balance of **imperative** and **grace**, of **means** and **sovereignty**, gave his work extraordinary pastoral traction, undercutting both **antinomian** and **legalistic** distortions.

#### 4. Atonement and sufficiency: Between commercial and governmental accounts
Fuller’s soteriology turned on the sufficiency of Christ’s satisfaction. Against a High Calvinist **commercial** view that reckoned the atonement as a pecuniary payment for a numerically identical debt of sins, he argued for the infinite value of **Christ’s obedience and blood** rooted in his **divine person**. In various essays and polemics clustered around 1793 to 1801, as well as in correspondence with **Abraham Booth** and replies to **William Button**, Fuller contended that Scripture does not traffic in a ledger of equivalent units but teaches **penal substitution** grounded in the worth of the substitute. This enabled him to maintain **particular redemption** in design and application, while defending a real **sufficiency for all** that undergirds **duty-faith** and the **free offer**.

Critics later labeled this stance **Fullerism**, fearing it collapsed into **Grotius’s governmental theory**. Fuller denied the charge in principle. He affirmed that Christ bore the **curse of the law** in the stead of his people, that the atonement was substitutionary and truly **expiatory**, and that its ends were definite in **pactum salutis** terms. What he rejected was the narrowing of substitution to commercial equivalence that seemed to make the atonement itself non-instantiable to any but the elect. By rooting sufficiency in the dignity of the person, he could say the atonement is intrinsically adequate for the world, while **union with Christ** and **effectual calling** determine its infallible efficacy. The maxim **sufficienter omnibus, efficienter electis** thus served as a structural hinge, stabilizing **duty-faith** without universalism.

#### 5. Faith, affections, and anti-Sandemanian polemic
By the turn of the century, Fuller faced a different challenge. **Robert Sandeman** had popularized a definition of saving faith as bare assent to gospel propositions. Fuller’s **Strictures on Sandemanianism** 1810 mounted a sustained rebuttal. Drawing on **Edwards** and the New Testament witness to **repentance**, **faith working by love**, and **new creation**, Fuller argued that saving faith entails a Spirit-given **holy disposition** that actively closes with Christ, not simply an unanimated inference. The enemy was not rationality but the reduction of **fiducia** to mere **assensus**. The stakes were soteriological and ecclesial: Sandemanian faith produced churches without **discipline**, without **sacramental** seriousness, and without evangelistic warmth.

Fuller’s positive construction also screened out **antinomianism**. In sermons and treatises he pressed **obedience** as the fruit of faith, not its meritorious cause. He could therefore both denounce Sandemanian minimalism and call believers to **mortification** and **holiness**. The interplay of **affections** and **volition** is central: renewed hearts delight in **Christ’s excellency**, and that delight, though not meritorious, is the very energy of evangelical obedience. This yielded a pastoral theology wherein **assurance** grows through the Spirit’s witness with our spirit and the visible fruits of **love**, **joy**, and **self-denial** in communion with the crucified Lord.

#### 6. Anti-Socinian apologetics: Moral tendency and the deity of Christ
Fuller’s apologetic corpus, notably **The Calvinistic and Socinian Systems Examined and Compared** 1793 and **The Gospel its Own Witness** 1799, targeted **Socinianism** and **Unitarianism** as corrosive both to revealed doctrine and to moral life. The method was twofold. First, he argued exegetically for **Christ’s deity**, **atoning death**, and **original sin**. Second, he compared the **moral tendency** of systems, contending that **trinitarian** and **atonement** doctrines uniquely sustain humility, repentance, and zeal. Socinian appeals to reason produced, in Fuller’s judgment, neither the worship of the **triune God** nor the self-renouncing ethics displayed in apostolic churches.

Here again Fuller’s **Edwardsian** instincts are visible. He did not oppose reason but located reason within a **noetic** economy marred by sin’s **moral inability**. Only the **Spirit** illumines the soul to see the **glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ**. Because the gospel bears its own **self-authenticating** witness, as **The Gospel its Own Witness** insisted, the deepest apologetic is the gospel’s power to reconfigure the moral world of believers. Fuller thereby held together **classical dogma** and **evangelical piety**, refusing to trade **penal substitution** or **incarnation** for a veneer of Enlightenment plausibility.

#### 7. Missionary advocacy and the use of means
If **The Gospel Worthy of All Acceptation** forged the theological engine, the formation of the **Baptist Missionary Society** in 1792 was the vehicle. Fuller served as secretary from its inception until his death, laboring with **William Carey**, **John Ryland Jr.**, and **Samuel Pearce** to awaken Particular Baptists to the **use of means**. His **Apology for the Late Christian Missions to India** 1808 answered critics who charged the enterprise as fanatic or Arminian. To the contrary, the **free offer** flows from **sovereign grace**. God ordains both ends and means. Preaching, translation, and catechesis are appointed instruments by which the Spirit calls the elect out of the nations.

Theologically, this was the outworking of Fuller’s **ordo salutis** within a global **missio Dei**. The general call, grounded in the universal sufficiency of **Christ’s atonement**, reaches the world through the church’s **preaching** and **sacraments**. The **effectual call** remains God’s secret work. Fuller’s language of **duty-faith** crossed from polemic into practice: every hearer is summoned, every minister commissioned. The Great Commission is not a counsel of possibility but a command with **divine authority**. Hence the Kettering covenant to raise funds and send laborers, the letters that crisscrossed the Atlantic world, and the conviction that **Providence** and **prayer** converge in the harvest of the nations.

#### 8. Ecclesial and pastoral concerns: Communion, discipline, and spirituality
While mission occupied much of his later energy, Fuller never surrendered pastoral priorities. In sermons and pastoral tracts he emphasized **church discipline**, the holiness of **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper**, and the cultivation of **family religion**. He pressed for a disciplined piety shaped by **Scripture**, **prayer**, and **self-examination**. His Memoir of **Samuel Pearce** 1800 modeled evangelical spirituality suffused with missionary ardor and **cross-bearing** love. In the communion debates of his day, though overshadowed by later arguments between **Robert Hall Jr.** and strict communion Baptists, Fuller sought to align **church order** with **gospel catholicity**, guarding the integrity of believers’ baptism while insisting on the **unity** of all who cleave to **Christ crucified**.

Underneath these pastoral exhortations lay doctrinal commitments already noted: **faith** as a Spirit-wrought **holy disposition**, the necessity of **repentance**, the reality of **perseverance**, and the freedom of God in **election** and **calling**. The pastoral aim was to produce churches immune to both **formalism** and **enthusiasm**, ordered by the **Word**, and animated by the **Spirit**. Fuller’s tone is consistently experimental in the Puritan sense: doctrine tested in the crucible of **experience**, never detached from the **means of grace**, always driving toward **godliness**.

#### 9. Legacy: Evangelical Calvinism institutionalized
By the time of his death in 1815, **Andrew Fuller** had reset the compass for English **Particular Baptists**. His **evangelical Calvinism** became the mainstream of nineteenth-century Baptist life, shaping **Charles Haddon Spurgeon** and the missionary societies that surged across the British world. His clarifications regarding **duty-faith**, the **free offer**, and **moral inability** were widely adopted beyond Baptist circles, informing evangelical debates on the **warrant of faith** and the **gospel call**. His apologetics against **Socinianism** fortified British evangelicalism at a formative moment, while his critique of **Sandemanianism** secured a thicker account of **faith** that integrated **affections**, **will**, and **truth**.

The reception was not without controversy. The specter of **Fullerism** remained a live accusation among High Calvinists who feared a slide into **governmental atonement**. Yet Fullers own heirs and many later **Reformed** theologians judged that his modifications were not betrayals but recalibrations inspired by **Scripture** and by **Edwards**. His role as theological architect of the **Baptist Missionary Society** secured his place among the founding figures of modern Protestant **missions**, with his theology underwriting practice by insisting that **means** are ordained by the God who elects and calls.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: Strengths and cautions
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Fuller’s achievement commands admiration on several fronts. First, his defense of the **free offer of the gospel**, grounded in **duty-faith** and **moral inability**, clarifies categories already latent in the **Westminster Confession** on the fall, the will, and **effectual calling**. His insistence that inability does not erase duty echoes Reformed accounts of the law and the gospel and strengthens **missions** and **evangelism**. Second, his rejection of **Sandemanianism** and his Edwardsian account of **affections** rehabilitate **fiducia** as integral to saving faith, a necessary corrective to rationalistic reduction. Third, his anti-**Socinian** polemics powerfully defend **Christ’s deity**, **penal substitution**, and the Spirit’s illumination against Enlightenment rationalism.

Two cautions remain. Fuller’s critique of a **commercial** construal of satisfaction and his appeal to the atonement’s value risk imprecision regarding **imputation** and the nature of **substitution**. While he denied **governmental theory**, his idiom can blur the line between intrinsic sufficiency and the covenantal design that renders the atonement definitively for the elect. Classical Reformed theology can preserve Fuller’s **sufficienter omnibus** while more explicitly indexing sufficiency to the infinite dignity of the person who, by covenant, bore the curse for the elect in a truly **federal** and **forensic** exchange. Secondly, the appeal to **moral tendency** as a theological test is pastorally shrewd but must remain subordinate to **revelation** rather than sliding into a pragmatic criterion. In sum, within a Westminster framework of **revelation and covenant**, Fuller’s **evangelical Calvinism** deserves high marks for its biblical fidelity and missionary fruit, provided his atonement idiom is tethered to robust **imputation**, **definite intent**, and a clear doctrine of the **pactum salutis**.
