### ESSAY
Hugh J. McCann emerges as a late-modern figure whose philosophical theology is forged within the idiom of **analytic philosophy of action** and the revitalized **classical theism** of the post-1960 analytic scene. Trained as a philosopher and long based at Texas A and M, he wrote during the crest of the **Plantinga**-inspired renaissance that put **divine attributes**, **providence**, and **human freedom** back on the analytic agenda. The material culture was that of journals like Faith and Philosophy and Philosophy and Phenomenological Research, where debates over **libertarian freedom**, **agent-causation**, and **compatibilism** intersected with renewed readings of **Aquinas** and **Augustine** on **creatio ex nihilo**. McCann’s method is deliberately metaphysical: he harnesses the micro-clarity of **Davidsonian** and **Anscombean** action theory, the formal rigor of modal analysis, and a retrieval of **divine simplicity** and **timeless eternity** to construe **providence** without causal competition.

The controlling methodological commitments are two. First, a robust **agent-causation** account of action and will, according to which substances, not only events, are genuine sources of causal influence. This grounds **libertarian freedom** as ultimate sourcehood, resisting reduction to event-causal chains or psychophysical necessitation. Second, a classical doctrine of **God** as timeless, simple, and immutable, whose one **creative act** produces the entire temporal order **ex nihilo**. From these, McCann crafts a grand thesis on **divine sovereignty**: God’s **primary causation** does not compete with creaturely **secondary causation**, so that comprehensive **providence** and undetermined human agency are jointly secured. This anti-competitive stance is animated by the conviction that the metaphysical grammar for divine action must be categorically distinct from creaturely causation, a stance he deploys against both **Molinism** and **open theism**.

The first pillar is laid in **The Works of Agency: On Human Action, Will, and Freedom** 1998. There McCann treats the ontology of action, the structure of intention, and the nature of will in conversation with **Anscombe’s Intention**, **Davidson’s causal theory**, **Bratman’s planning theory**, and **Frankfurt** on volitional structure. He resists **event-causal** pictures that reduce action to bodily movements caused in the right way by beliefs and desires. Instead he argues for **volitionalism** anchored in **agent-causation**: basic actions issue from the agent’s exercise of a primitive causal power to will, where willing is not an inner event that needs a further cause but the agent’s settling of a question for action. Intentions are conduct-controlling commitments rather than mere predictions, and reasons explain actions not as efficient causes but as rationalizing grounds that do not necessitate. The upshot is an account of **freedom** that preserves alternative possibilities and self-originating control, poised to reject reductive **compatibilism**.

McCann’s libertarianism is sharpened by his replies to familiar challenges from **Frankfurt-style** cases and from the purported way reasons fix the will. He insists that sufficient reasons do not entail determination, since rational responsiveness is compatible with nonnecessitating explanation; the **agent** is the originating cause that makes the difference. In a world ordered by **laws of nature** and psychological regularities, there remain underived exercises of will that are not products of prior events. This connects to his larger ontology, where causation by agents is sui generis and cannot be swallowed by **event-causation**. The moral anatomy of action also matters: McCann locates responsibility in the agent’s intention, such that the moral quality of an action depends on what the agent willed, not on independent event-level descriptions. This moral-psychological analysis will later inform his answer to the **author of sin** objection in his theology of **providence**.

The second pillar is the theological monograph **Creation and the Sovereignty of God** 2012, a sustained analytic defense of **classical theism** that seeks to harmonize **exhaustive sovereignty** with **libertarian freedom**. The central claim is that God’s single, timeless **creative act** produces every contingent fact, including free human acts, without determining them. God is outside time and does not undergo successive deliberations; he timelessly wills a complete history. Yet because **creation** is not an intra-worldly efficient cause among causes, divine creative dependence does not eliminate **secondary causes** or force their outcomes. McCann rejects **Molinism** on the grounds that **middle knowledge** imputes to God dependence on brute counterfactuals of creaturely freedom that he did not determine, thereby compromising **aseity** and **sovereignty**. He equally rejects **open theism**, which sacrifices **omniscience** for creaturely freedom and misconstrues the logic of divine timelessness.

At the heart of his epistemology of God is what might be called **omniscience by decree**. God does not look ahead to foreknow what free creatures will do, nor does he infer via **middle knowledge** how they would act under counterfactual conditions. Rather, because of **divine simplicity**, God’s knowing and willing are numerically identical, so that by knowing his own single creative intention he knows the complete content of the world that intention produces. On this view, God’s knowledge of contingents is not mediated by propositions external to him but is grounded in his own **creative act**. This gives McCann a transparent account of prophecy, prayer, and providential governance without any need for temporally indexed acts of knowing. Interlocutors such as **Flint** on Molinist providence and **Hasker** on open theism are answered by insisting that all truths about what free agents do are dependent truths whose ultimate explanation is the divine intention, even though creaturely action remains **libertarian** and non-determined. The metaphysics of **timeless eternity** here is indebted to **Stump and Kretzmann** and to **Leftow**, though McCann emphasizes decree-based cognition over model-theoretic constructions of eternity.

The problem of evil is treated through a synthesis of **permission**, **double effect**, and the moral structure of intention. McCann contends that God is not the **author of sin**, because in his single **creative act** God does not intend any moral evil either as means or end, though he intends to create a world containing free agency under which moral failures will occur. The moral defect in sin resides in the errant finite **intention** of the human agent, not in the occurrence of the event as such considered qua physical happening. Since **primary causation** is categorically distinct, it is a mistake to transfer moral predicates from the temporal agent’s will to the **creative will** of God. He thus appropriates the **doctrine of double effect** to say that God may allow what he does not intend, while preserving meticulous **providence** in the order of being. Here McCann distances himself from **theodicies** that claim God needs evil for greater goods, preferring instead a permissive account nested within the goodness of **creation** and the non-necessitating structure of **concurrence**.

A further implication is a rigorous account of the **freedom of God** consistent with **aseity** and **simplicity**. God creates freely, not from compulsion or lack, and his reasons for creating do not determine his will as if reasons were efficient causes. McCann emphasizes that divine reasons are not external standards constraining God; rather, in line with **classical theism**, God’s goodness is identical to his essence, and the expression of that goodness in **creation** is a free act. He resists any **theistic personalism** that would psychologize God’s deliberation or depict reasons as pushing the divine will around. The result is a model in which divine **immutability** and **impassibility** are retained, the world’s contingency is honored, and the creature’s **libertarian integrity** is safeguarded under an all-encompassing **decree**.

McCann’s framework is honed through debate with leading contemporaries. Against **Plantinga’s** free will defense and **van Inwagen’s** consequence argument, he supplies a positive metaphysics of **agent-causation** that makes freedom more than the absence of determinism. In contrast to **Swinburne’s** everlasting God, McCann favors **timeless eternity** as the only way to avoid temporalizing the divine intellect and will. He borrows from **Aquinas** the grammar of **primary and secondary causation**, while refusing Thomistic **physical premotion** or any version of **premolinism** that would render the creature’s act necessitated by God’s prior motion. With **Bratman**, he grants the practical architecture of plans and policies, yet he insists intentions are efficacious exercises of a primitive power, not merely plan-like states that guide. His dialogue with **Flint** and **Hasker** is particularly sharp: **Molinism** compromises **aseity**; **open theism** compromises **omniscience**; **compatibilism** compromises **libertarian responsibility**. McCann’s via media is classical **sovereignty** without **competition**, **omniscience** without **middle knowledge**, and **freedom** without **determinism**.

The theological payoff is a portrait of **providence** that is both maximal and non-intrusive. Prayer, on McCann’s account, is enveloped within the **decree** as one of the ordained means by which God brings about his ends, with God’s timeless knowledge of prayer depending on his creative intention that includes the petitioner’s act. Miracles are not violations of laws so much as special patterns of **primary causation** that establish new segments of the temporal order; their contingency is compatible with the stability of **secondary causes**. Eschatology and salvation history are read through the same lens: a single **creative will** that comprehends all times and actions, yet a genuine **libertarian agency** that renders obedience and rebellion meaningful. Throughout, McCann stays close to **divine simplicity**, the key that unifies God’s knowing and willing and thereby grounds **omniscience by decree**.

From a Reformed and WTS evaluation, McCann’s analytic recovery of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **timeless eternity** is a salutary retrieval that resists both **Molinism** and **open theism**, and his focus on **omniscience by decree** resonates with a classical **decretal** outlook. Yet his insistence on **libertarian freedom** and a non-determining **concursus** sits uneasily with Reformed **compatibilism**, the doctrine of a comprehensive, efficacious **decree** employing **secondary causes** that infallibly bring about all that comes to pass. The proposal that God timelessly creates the whole history including free sins while not determining them risks softening the confessional denial that God is the **author of sin**, since the Reformed tradition locates moral authorship not only in intention but also in the specificity of God’s purposive **providence** over history. A Westminster alternative would affirm noncompetitive **primary causation** but add a robust doctrine of **meticulous providence** through morally significant **concurrence** and **permission** that is nonetheless efficacious, together with a **compatibilist** account of freedom as acting according to one’s nature and strongest inclination under God’s sovereign ordination. It would also subordinate metaphysical construction to **revelation** in Scripture, letting the **covenantal** economy of creation and redemption specify the grammar of **sovereignty**, rather than seeking equilibrium primarily through a priori models of **agency**. McCann’s vision thus provokes constructive work on decree, concursus, and responsibility; its strengths in **classical theism** are considerable, but its libertarian resolution remains in principled tension with **Reformed orthodoxy**.
