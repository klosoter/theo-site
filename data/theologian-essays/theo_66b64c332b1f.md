### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, method
Peter-Paul Verbeek, a Dutch philosopher born in 1970, emerges within the European scene that turned from grand metaphysical diagnoses to the granular analysis of technologies in use, a shift often named the **empirical turn in philosophy of technology**. Educated and later teaching at the University of Twente, he consolidates a school that integrates **phenomenology** with **Science and Technology Studies**, indebted to **Don Ihde** on experience and to **Bruno Latour** on **actor-network** mediation. Against **technological determinism** that treats devices as autonomous forces and against the **neutrality thesis** that treats tools as mere instruments, Verbeek advances **postphenomenological mediation**, a method that analyzes how concrete artifacts shape the relations between humans and world. The governing thesis is that technologies have **technological intentionality**, a directedness that invites and inhibits, amplifies and reduces, so that agency is distributed across **human-technology-world relations**.

The method is resolutely empirical and pragmatic. Verbeek draws on **John Dewey's** insight that ethics must emerge where problems arise in practice, yet he refracts that pragmatism through **phenomenological description** of experience and action. From **Ihde** he inherits typologies of mediation such as **embodiment relations** where a tool extends the body, **hermeneutic relations** where a device provides a readable presentation of the world, **alterity relations** where technologies appear as quasi-others, and **background relations** where devices operate tacitly. Verbeek radicalizes these typologies by adding **hybrid intentionality** and **technological intentionality**, seeking to show that artifacts participate in the constitution of moral fields. The result is a method he calls **mediation theory** that centers the triadic relation human–technology–world rather than the dyad subject–object.

#### 2. What Things Do 2005, from phenomenology to scripts
In **What Things Do** published in 2005, Verbeek proposes an integrated account that weds **phenomenology** and **actor-network theory** into a single analytic of **technological mediation**. The book argues that artifacts are not passive intermediaries but active mediators that transform both perception and action. Borrowing **Latour's** notion of **delegation** and **script**, Verbeek shows how designers inscribe programs of action into artifacts, how users interpret or resist those scripts, and how these inscriptions materially configure behavior. Classic examples include the speed bump that scripturally slows drivers, the ultrasound image that hermeneutically discloses the fetus and reconfigures parental responsibility, and the thermometer that mediates bodily sensation into readable temperature. The point is not anecdotal but ontological, namely that things exercise a **quasi-agency** that is constitutive of human-world relations.

The book also distinguishes **multistability** from essentialism. Drawing on **Ihde's** term, Verbeek notes that the same artifact can stabilize different relations in different practices, such that meaning and use co-emerge. This multistability does not imply relativism, but it undermines a single **essence of technology**, like **Heidegger's** **Gestell** or enframing. Verbeek critiques **Heidegger** for an overly totalizing diagnosis that erases empirical difference, while appropriating from him the insight that technology reveals a world. Hence **What Things Do** does methodological work, inviting the philosopher to attend to the material-semiotic texture of practices while maintaining the phenomenological focus on intentionality.

#### 3. Moralizing Technology 2011, from description to normativity
With **Moralizing Technology** in 2011, Verbeek moves from descriptive accounts of mediation to a normative project keyed to **design ethics**. The crucial claim is that morality is not only in human decision but is also materially mediated. Artifacts help to shape what counts as a salient good, which courses of action appear permissible, and which responsibilities are foregrounded or backgrounded. Verbeek names this **moral mediation**, insisting that things help to shape the good life by configuring character and choice. The book does not say that things possess moral agency in a human sense, but that they carry **technological intentionality** that co-constitutes moral fields. Thus the problem for ethics is not simply right choice by autonomous agents, but wisely designed mediations to nurture responsible agency.

Verbeek reframes responsibility accordingly, recommending an approach he calls **accompanying technology**, which is less about control and prohibition and more about guidance and co-shaping through design. The design table becomes a site of ethical deliberation. Drawing on **Dewey's** experimentalism, Verbeek urges iterative design that tests how artifacts mediate perception and action, coupled with stakeholder reflection. He is sympathetic to **Value Sensitive Design** yet distances himself from lists of fixed values. Instead, he proposes that values are themselves mediated and can be discovered and fostered by attending to **human-technology-world relations**. Normativity thus remains immanent to practices, though he does not deny the legitimacy of public norms. The conceptual shift is from ethics after the fact to ethics in the making.

#### 4. Articles and edited work, consolidation and extensions
Between **What Things Do** and **Moralizing Technology**, and in the years following, Verbeek consolidates his approach through essays such as **Materializing Morality** in 2006 and editorial work like **Postphenomenological Investigations** with **Robert Rosenberger** in 2015. In **Materializing Morality**, he argues that moral frameworks are literally materialized in artifacts, from door closers that discipline bodies to medical imaging that formats familial bonds. The 2015 edited volume broadens the empirical base, collecting studies on **multistability**, **augmentation**, and **hybrid infrastructures**, thereby institutionalizing **postphenomenology** as a living research program. Across this corpus Verbeek refines a vocabulary of **mediation**, **script**, **intentionality**, **amplification and reduction**, and **disclosure** that remains continuous with phenomenology yet open to empirical study.

These texts also extend **mediation theory** into domains of **bioethics**, **human enhancement**, **robotics**, and **ambient intelligence**. When technologies enter intimate spaces of sensing and decision, from prenatal screening to domestic surveillance, the stakes of **moral mediation** become explicit. Verbeek resists the framing that treats enhancement or automation as purely libertarian choices or technophobic declines. Instead, he asks which mediations are at issue, who is addressed as a subject, and how action is redistributed across networks. The criteria are pragmatic and experiential, yet the upshot is an ethics that pursues responsible **co-shaping** rather than categorical affirmation or rejection.

#### 5. Interlocutors and contrasts, clarifying the middle path
Verbeek’s project positions itself between several poles. Against **Heidegger's Gestell**, he rejects an essentialist essence of technology, insisting on empirical **multistability** and specific **mediation**. Against **Langdon Winner**, who famously asked whether artifacts have politics, Verbeek agrees that politics can be built into things, yet he hesitates to attribute robust agency to artifacts and instead modifies the claim to **technological intentionality**. Against **Andrew Feenberg's** critical theory, he shares a concern for democracy and emancipation but resists totalizing dichotomies of system and lifeworld, opting for design-oriented interventions. With **Latour**, he shares the intuition of **actant** networks and **delegation**, but he resists dissolving human subjectivity into flat networks by retaining the phenomenological register of intentional experience.

Within the tradition of **Don Ihde's postphenomenology**, Verbeek both inherits and innovates. He inherits the insistence that technologies transform intentional relations and the typology of **embodiment**, **hermeneutic**, **alterity**, and **background** relations. He innovates by arguing that these transformations are not morally neutral, that technologies co-constitute the good and the right, and that ethics must work at the level of **design mediation**. The phrase **moralizing technology** risks misunderstanding. It does not mean moralistic condemnation of devices, but the embedding of moral reflection in the making and governance of artifacts. This middle path gives his work both philosophical depth and practical traction.

#### 6. Agency, responsibility, and the distribution of the moral
A persistent theme in Verbeek's work is the reconfiguration of **agency** and **responsibility** under conditions of pervasive mediation. If agency is distributed, then so is responsibility. Verbeek argues that responsibility should be understood as a networked property in which designers, users, institutions, and technologies are all implicated. This does not absolve persons, but it prevents scapegoating the user or fetishizing the designer. In **Moralizing Technology**, he illustrates how **technological intentionality** shapes decision spaces before explicit choice, thereby calling for anticipatory ethics. The obligation is to design and deploy mediations that foster attentiveness, care, and human flourishing within specific practices.

This perspective generates novel assessments of **automation**, **AI**, and **robotics**. For instance, rather than asking whether autonomous systems are moral agents, Verbeek asks how they mediate perception, trust, and accountability. Are there **hermeneutic relations** in which dashboards oversimplify complex realities. Are there **embodiment relations** in which wearables tutor habits or atrophy skills. Are there **background relations** in which smart environments silently configure behavior. Such questions anchor responsibility in the concrete, and they suggest governance regimes attuned to **mediation analysis** rather than only to rights and risks.

#### 7. Strengths and limitations of an immanent normativity
The strength of Verbeek's normativity is its **immanence**. Values are not simply asserted but traced as they are materially staged. This lets ethics speak intelligibly to engineers and policymakers. The language of **accompanying technology** has thus proven fruitful for **responsible research and innovation** and for programs of **ethics by design**. Yet the very immanence invites critique. If all norms are mediated, on what grounds do we challenge oppressive or manipulative mediations. Verbeek suggests pragmatic testing and democratic deliberation, which are important but potentially thin when structural injustices are at stake. Critics drawing from **critical theory** or **virtue ethics** worry that **moral mediation** without a thicker account of the good may legitimate whatever works.

Verbeek is alert to this tension and gestures toward **public norms** and **deliberative processes** that can counteract domination. He is also explicit that some mediations are undesirable because they diminish capacities for care, responsibility, or democratic participation. Still, the architecture of his theory resists transcendental grounding. He does not invoke **natural law**, **teleology**, or **metaphysical goods**. This is a principled choice, embedded in a **pragmatist** inheritance and a **postphenomenological** humility. Whether that choice suffices for robust critique remains an open question, but it is part of the clarity of his project that it owns its immanent frame.

#### 8. Crossings with theology of technology, from Ellul to Borgmann
For theologians the signal of Verbeek's work sounds familiar and provocative. In contrast to **Jacques Ellul's** prophecy of **la technique** as a totalizing system, Verbeek offers a many-splendored analysis of **multistability** and **mediation**, which aligns with theological attention to practices and virtues. In contrast to **Albert Borgmann's** device paradigm, which laments a loss of focal things, Verbeek refrains from nostalgia and instead asks how design can produce richer mediations. His **moral mediation** resonates with Christian reflections on the formative power of liturgies and material culture, echoing the idea that practices and artifacts are **means of formation**. Yet he remains within an **immanent** horizon. There is no **eschatological** telos, no doctrine of **creation** and **fall** to situate technology within a redemptive arc, and no account of **divine providence** to underwrite hopes for guidance and limits.

Still, Verbeek gives theologians of technology a disciplined vocabulary. Talk of **technological intentionality** sharpens discussions of idolatry and virtue by pinpointing how devices command attention and desire. The typology of **embodiment** and **hermeneutic** relations can specify how technologies mediate prayer, community, and knowledge. The emphasis on **design ethics** invites ecclesial and civic participation in shaping tools rather than only reacting to them. In this sense, Verbeek is a genuine ally for any tradition that rejects both naive embrace and apocalyptic refusal, and that seeks to practice prudence within God’s world of artifacts.

#### 9. Legacy and continuing program
Peter-Paul Verbeek’s enduring contribution is the consolidation of **technological mediation** as a research program and an ethical practice. He shows with conceptual rigor and empirical sensitivity how artifacts disclose worlds and co-author actions. He equips philosophers and engineers with categories like **script**, **amplification and reduction**, **hybrid intentionality**, and **multistability** that travel well across domains. His two flagship books, **What Things Do** and **Moralizing Technology**, anchor a literature that now extends into **postphenomenological investigations** of robotics, medicine, architecture, and education. The program continues to engage **Heidegger**, **Latour**, **Ihde**, **Dewey**, and **Feenberg**, not as authorities to be followed but as interlocutors in an ongoing clarification of method and normativity.

The ethos of his work is neither resigned nor utopian. It is experimental and hopeful. It places responsibility where it must be placed, in the artifacts we design and the practices we inhabit. If technologies are non-neutral, as he insists, then ethics must be vigilant and creative. The philosophical wager is that careful description of **human-technology-world relations** will yield actionable guidance for shaping better mediations. This wager has already influenced design programs and policy frameworks worldwide, making Verbeek a principal architect of the contemporary **ethics by design** movement.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed evaluation, keyed to the Westminster standards, can offer both affirmation and correction. There is deep agreement with Verbeek’s denial of **technological neutrality** and his insistence on **design responsibility**. The doctrine of **creation** and the **cultural mandate** in Genesis underscore that artifacts are covenantally significant and that human making is a mode of obedient stewardship under **divine providence**. Verbeek’s **mediation theory** can be read as a phenomenology of **secondary causes** by which God ordinarily governs the world, naming how tools shape the creaturely economy of perception and action. His analysis of **moral mediation** aligns with the Reformed insight into the **noetic effects of sin** and into **habit formation**, reminding us that liturgies are not only ecclesial but also technological.

Yet Reformed theology must demur at the level of normative grounding. In Verbeek, **normativity** remains immanent to practices and negotiated through **pragmatic deliberation**. The Reformed tradition grounds moral claim in **lex naturae**, the law of God revealed in creation and clarified in Scripture, under the rule of Christ’s **covenant**. Without such teleological anchoring, mediation risks becoming a moral source rather than a means ordered to a prior *telos*, and design can drift toward adaptive accommodation to prevailing desires. A Reformed alternative would appropriate **technological mediation** as a diagnostic instrument while subjecting mediations to the covenantal norms of love of God and neighbor, Sabbath-shaped limits, justice for the vulnerable, and truthfulness in representation. It would integrate Verbeek’s **accompanying technology** with **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace**, encouraging Christians to design and govern technologies that direct cultural powers toward creational flourishing while resisting idolatries of efficiency and control. In sum, Verbeek offers indispensable tools for discerning how artifacts form us, and the Reformed tradition supplies the transcendent grammar by which those tools can be ordered to wisdom.
