### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context
Born in 1646 in **Leipzig**, **Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz** matured within a late **Lutheran** culture marked by scholastic rigor and emergent **Enlightenment rationalism**. He studied at Leipzig and Jena, absorbed **Aristotelian** logic and **scholastic** metaphysics from **Suarez** and **Aquinas**, and earned a doctorate in law at Altdorf in 1666. From 1667 he served at Mainz under **Baron von Boineburg**, honing a diplomatic habit of conciliation that would later shape his theological bent toward reconciliation of **faith and reason**. Paris years from 1672 to 1676 brought scientific apprenticeship under **Christiaan Huygens**, encounters with **Cartesian** mechanics, and a pioneering discovery of the **calculus** that would draw him into later controversy with **Isaac Newton**. A 1676 stop at The Hague for conversations with **Benedict Spinoza** supplied both attraction to systematic unity and a lasting caution against **necessitarianism**. Settled in Hanover from 1676, he served the Brunswick court, while founding the **Berlin Academy** in 1700 and maintaining voluminous correspondences with **Arnauld**, **Bossuet**, **Locke**, **Clarke**, and others. Through it all the core remained constant: a theological rationalism centered on **divine wisdom**, **order**, and **final causes**, aimed at showing that the world is governed by **providence** according to reasons worthy of God.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Leibniz’s method is a **rationalist theistic metaphysics** built on two axioms, the **principle of non-contradiction** and the **principle of sufficient reason**. The first secures the domain of necessary truths, which he calls **truths of reason**, while the second grounds contingent truths, called **truths of fact**, in a reason that explains why things are thus rather than otherwise. He articulates *ratio sufficiens*, that is sufficient reason, as the luminous thread that binds cosmology to theology, for the ultimate sufficient reason must be in **God** who is **necessary being**, **infinite wisdom**, and **divine simplicity**. Against the narrow empiricism of **Locke**, he defends innate cognitive structures in **Meditations on Knowledge, Truth, and Ideas** 1684 and later **Nouveaux Essais** 1765. He prizes **final causes** as coordinate with **efficient causes**, rejecting the restriction of science to mechanism alone. He dreams of a **characteristica universalis** and **calculus ratiocinator**, a universal logical language and an algorithm of reasoning, as instruments to settle disputes in **philosophical theology** and law. Method is thus inseparable from piety, for the order of reasons mirrors the **ordo sapientiae** in the divine mind, and metaphysics becomes **theologia naturalis** under the light of **sufficient reason**.

#### 3. Discourse on Metaphysics and the Arnauld exchange
The **Discourse on Metaphysics** 1686 is the programmatic statement of Leibniz’s mature metaphysics. He proposes the **complete concept theory**, that the individual notion of a substance contains all predicates true of it across time. From this follows a new account of truth, predication, and providence. **Truths of reason** are analytic and necessary, grounded in the **divine intellect** as **eternal truths**, while **truths of fact** are contingent, grounded in God’s free decree to create this world among many possibilities. The French **Augustinian** theologian **Antoine Arnauld** objects that complete concepts threaten human freedom and divine freedom, since every future predicate would seem fixed. Leibniz replies that the necessity is only hypothetical, not absolute, and that God’s decree chooses among **compossible** sets of individuals, a notion he later terms **compossibility**, such that free acts are included within the chosen order without being coerced. The **Arnauld correspondence** 1686–1690 stabilizes key distinctions between **moral necessity** and **metaphysical necessity**, and clarifies that the **eternal truths in divina mente** do not bind God by an alien standard but express the divine nature as **intellectus** and **recta ratio**. Predestination is reinterpreted as the selection of an entire world order, guided by the **principle of the best**, a teleological rationality worthy of **divine goodness**.

#### 4. Monadology and pre-established harmony
The 1714 **Monadology** compresses the system into a series of aphorisms. All created things are aggregates of **monads**, simple indivisible substances endowed with **perception** and **appetition**. Monads have no windows, which means no creature causally penetrates another at the level of substantial form. Coordination among monads is achieved by **pre-established harmony**, *harmonia praestabilita*, decreed by God at creation. In this way he rejects the **occasionalism** of **Malebranche** and the **interactionism** of **Descartes**, while preserving a robust **divine concurrence** through universal preordination of the states of created substances. The levels of monads range from **bare monads** with confused perceptions, to **animal souls**, to **rational minds** capable of reflection and moral knowledge. Each monad is a **mirror of the universe** according to its standpoint, ordered by the **law of continuity** and distinguished by the **principle of the identity of indiscernibles**. The world as a totality is a set of **compossible** monads and laws that maximize intelligibility and goodness under **divine wisdom**. The metaphysical architecture thus promises a deeply integrated **philosophical theology**, in which **providence** is ubiquitous without collapsing into fate.

#### 5. Theodicy and the principle of the best
The **Essais de Théodicée** 1710 offers the most explicit theological argument of Leibniz, aimed primarily at the critique of **Pierre Bayle**. He differentiates **metaphysical evil** as limitation intrinsic to finite being, **physical evil** as suffering, and **moral evil** as sin. Evil is a privation, echoing **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, and therefore not a positive entity attributable to **divine causality**. God permits evil for the sake of a greater order and the **best of all possible worlds**, a phrase that became a lightning rod for polemic. The **principle of the best**, *optimi rationes*, is the wise rule of divine choice, grounded in the perfection of **divine goodness** and **wisdom**, not in an external calculus. Leibniz draws on the theme of **felix culpa**, the fortunate fall, to argue that greater goods such as redemption and moral heroism are possible only in a world containing the risk of sin and suffering. He denies **Manichean dualism** and any hint of **necessitarianism**, insisting that God freely chooses among infinitely many possible worlds. He frames **original sin** and grace within this moral universe by arguing that divine permission and cooperation never coerce, while the overall order assures the triumph of **justice and mercy** at the level of the whole.

#### 6. Freedom, grace, and predestination
Leibniz’s doctrine of freedom is a carefully calibrated **compatibilism**. Human acts are free when they proceed from **spontaneity** and **intelligence** without extrinsic compulsion. He distinguishes **moral necessity**, which arises from the rational appetition of the good, from **metaphysical necessity**, which would collapse freedom. Drawing on debates between **Molina** and the **Thomists**, he describes divine foreknowledge and providence in terms of **complete concepts** and **compossibility**, not in terms of a separate scientia media. God knows which free choices any rational agent would make in any ordering of circumstances, because the individual concept includes the whole history under a certain decree. Yet that decree concerns the selection of a world, not the imposition of coercion on a will. Moral necessity secures **responsibility**, since the agent acts from internal reasons that express his character. Grace functions as an influx of light and inclination consonant with rational nature, not as physical predetermination. The doctrine strives to honor both **divine sovereignty** and **creaturely liberty** under the **principle of sufficient reason**.

#### 7. Physics, space and time, and the Clarke controversy
In **De ipsa natura** 1698 and in the **Clarke correspondence** 1715–1716, Leibniz articulates a theological physics. Against **Newton** and **Clarke**, he defends the **relational theory of space and time**, arguing that absolute space would compromise **divine simplicity** and render God a being who must from time to time wind the world clock. He insists that **providence** institutes **laws of nature** as rational decrees, and that miracles are not violations of reason but exceptions relative to subordinate laws, always included in the higher **order of wisdom**. He defends **final causes** as explanatory and resists **mechanical materialism** by positing **living forces**, vis viva, as more basic than mere extension. In this debate, the **principle of sufficient reason** functions as a polemical tool, for without it one posits brute facts such as absolute position that lack explanatory ground. The **Clarke letters** reveal a theologian of nature who seeks to secure **divine concursus** through lawful harmony rather than through gaps in nature.

#### 8. Epistemology, logic, and ecumenical theology
The **Nouveaux Essais sur l’entendement humain**, published posthumously in 1765, replies to **John Locke**. Leibniz defends **innate ideas** as dispositions or tendencies, not fully formed notions, and clarifies degrees of cognition from **clear and confused** to **distinct and adequate**. He refines arguments for **God’s existence**, offering a modalized **ontological argument**, a **cosmological argument** from contingency grounded in **sufficient reason**, and a teleological argument from the pervasive order of **final causes**. His dream of a **characteristica universalis** promised a clarified metaphysical lexicon that could stabilize doctrinal discourse. This philosophical program was matched by a practical **ecumenical theology**. Leibniz pursued reunion projects between **Lutherans** and **Roman Catholics** with **Molanus** and **Bossuet**, seeking a minimal **doctrina catholica** founded on the **Apostles Creed**, a shared **Eucharistic** realism, and a common understanding of **grace** reconcilable with both sides. His conciliatory proposals presupposed that rational clarification of terms and principles could dissolve many confessional antagonisms, an application of his **harmonizing** metaphysics to the church.

#### 9. Possible worlds, logic, and legacy
Leibniz introduced a coherent **possible worlds** semantics in his account of **divine ideas** and **compossibility**, anticipating modern **modal logic**. The **identity of indiscernibles** and **complete concept theory** led to refinements in logic and metaphysics later codified by **Wolff**, while **Kant** criticized what he called the **Leibnizian-Wolffian** rationalism for neglecting the conditions of experience. In the twentieth century, **analytic philosophy** rescued the theological potential of **possible worlds** for **theodicy** and **divine omniscience**, while **process** thinkers appropriated the anti-occasionalist stress on **final causes**. Within theology, Leibniz’s **theodicy** remains a touchstone for discussions of **evil**, and his **compatibilist freedom** continues to inform debates over **providence and responsibility**. At the same time, his **pre-established harmony** and **monadology** have largely been rejected by physicists and theologians who favor more robust accounts of **causal interaction** and **covenantal history**. Yet the ambition to show the **rationality of faith** under the **principle of sufficient reason** has proven durable, shaping modern **natural theology** and interconfessional dialogue.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed assessment recognizes in **Leibniz** a profound ally on certain classical themes. His insistence on **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **wisdom** honors the **Creator creature distinction**, and his defense of **secondary causes** under **providence** converges with **Reformed scholastic** accounts of **concursus**. His **compatibilist freedom**, carefully distinguished by **moral necessity** rather than brute coercion, can be aligned with a broadly Augustinian and Reformed affirmation of **sovereign grace** and genuine responsibility. Yet decisive tensions remain. The **principle of sufficient reason** functions in Leibniz as a pretheological axiom that risks domesticating **mystery** and subjecting **revelation** to a tribunal of universal reason, whereas a **Westminster** approach begins with **Scripture** as principium and construes reason ministerially within an **archetypal ectypal** distinction. The **principle of the best** narrows the freedom of the **divine decree** by positing an optimality metric within the divine intellect, while classical Reformed divinity insists that God wills the good because he is the good, yet is free with respect to the choice of this created order, such that the decree is wise and holy without being determined by a maximality calculus. The **theodicy** rightly deploys **privation** and teleology, but it lacks the **Christocentric** shape of Reformed accounts that locate the resolution of evil in **covenant history**, **cross and resurrection**, and the **consummation**, rather than in a global optimism about net value. The **monadology** and **pre-established harmony** dilute **sacramentality** and **churchly means of grace**, and offer little thick doctrine of **Trinity** or **incarnation**, leaving **Christology** and **covenant** thin. A Reformed alternative retains **final causes** and robust **providence**, affirms **divine simplicity** and the **noetic effects of sin**, grounds logic and causality in **triune revelation**, and interprets evil within **redemptive history**, such that sufficient reason is received from **God’s speech** rather than imposed as a condition of its credibility.
