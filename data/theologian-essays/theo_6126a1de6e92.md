### TITLE
Recovering the unity and continuity of Reformed covenant theology up to the Westminster Assembly

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late twentieth and early twenty-first century retrieval of **post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy** against the **Calvin versus the Calvinists** thesis and the charge that **federal theology** was inherently legalistic, amid **Barth–Torrance** critiques. 
- Historically disciplined **historical theology** with close **source criticism**, mapping **conceptual history** of **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae**, clarifying **meritum ex pacto** and law–gospel usage. 
- Key work: **Unity and Continuity in Covenantal Thought: A Study in the Reformed Tradition to the Westminster Assembly** (2012). 
- Central categories: **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, **law and gospel**, **merit ex pacto**, **republication**, **subservient covenant**, **monopleuric and dipleuric** accounts, **sacramental sign and seal**, **federal headship**. 
- Interlocutors and influences: early Reformed figures (**Bullinger**, **Calvin**, **Ursinus**, **Olevianus**, **Rollock**, **Perkins**, **Ames**, **Cocceius**, **Witsius**) and modern scholars (**Richard A. Muller**, **Willem J. van Asselt**, against **R. T. Kendall**, **Brian G. Armstrong**, **J. B. Torrance**, and **Karl Barth**). 
- Reformed reception: valued in confessional circles for defending **Westminster** continuity; prompts dialogue with **Vosian** and **Klinean** readings on **republication** and redemptive history. 

### ESSAY
Andrew A. Woolsey emerges as a contemporary pastor-scholar whose single most significant contribution is the demonstration of **unity and continuity** within early **Reformed covenant theology** culminating in the **Westminster Assembly**. His signature monograph, **Unity and Continuity in Covenantal Thought** published in 2012 by Reformation Heritage Books, is a carefully constructed historical-theological case against the fragmentation narratives that pit **Calvin** against later **federalism**. Situating himself within a late twentieth-century retrieval led by **Richard A. Muller** and **Willem J. van Asselt**, Woolsey argues that the Reformed developed a stable two-covenant architecture that is neither legalistic nor a betrayal of **grace**. The scaffolding of his project is both historical and conceptual: he reads Latin and vernacular sources across Swiss, German, English, and Dutch streams, and he tracks terms like **foedus operum**, **foedus gratiae**, and **meritum ex pacto** with semantic patience. The result is a counter-narrative that vindicates the coherence of Reformed **federal thought** against caricatures derived from **Barth–Torrance** as well as older historiographies that oppose **Calvin** to the so-called scholastics.

Methodologically, Woolsey practices a restrained yet rigorous **historical theology** that foregrounds primary texts and lets doctrinal grammar surface from the sources. He is not constructing a new system but clarifying the Reformed system that was already formed by the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries. Key to his approach is terminological mapping: when the Reformed speak of **merit**, they often mean **merit ex pacto**, a covenantal fittingness rather than condign equality; when they predicate **conditions** of the **covenant of grace**, they often distinguish its monopleuric ground in divine promise from dipleuric administration demanding evangelical faith and repentance. Consistently he sharpens **law and gospel** so that neither is collapsed into the other: law as covenantal command, gospel as promissory word, both held together within a single **economy of the covenants**. In doing so he consciously follows the chastened historiography of **Muller** and **van Asselt**, resisting evolutionary schemata and avoiding anachronistic projections of modern debates upon early **orthodoxy**.

Woolsey begins his genealogy with **Heinrich Bullinger** and the Zurich school. He highlights **Bullinger’s** De testamento seu foedere Dei unico et aeterno of 1534 as seminal for a **unified covenant of grace** administered through the ages. For **Bullinger**, the single divine **foedus** underwrites Scripture’s narrative unity, securing **paedobaptism**, **church discipline**, and a pastoral theology of assurance grounded in God’s oath. Woolsey next treats **John Calvin** not as a foil but as a corroborating voice: in the 1559 Institutes and commentaries, **Calvin’s** insistence on one people of God and two administrations defines the continuity of the **testamentum** across Abrahamic and Mosaic epochs, with a clear Christological telos. While **Calvin** lacks a fully developed prelapsarian **covenant of works**, Woolsey shows that seeds of the doctrine appear in his treatment of Adam, probation, Sabbath, and life promised upon obedience. This early constellation reveals that later formalization of a **foedus operum** did not rupture the earlier **covenant of grace**, but clarified creation order and the need for redemption.

The Heidelberg axis becomes decisive for Woolsey’s thesis. In **Zacharias Ursinus’s** 1563 **Heidelberg Catechism** and theological writings, the structure of **law and gospel** and a nascent **covenant of works** are explicit: Adam stands under a divine demand whose breach renders the gospel necessary, while faith receives Christ and his benefits in the **covenant of grace**. **Caspar Olevianus’s** De substantia foederis gratiae of 1585 articulates the duplex substance of the covenant in Christ, consolidating a two-covenant schema without setting **works** and **grace** in competitive soteriological terms. Woolsey reads these figures to establish that early Reformed already saw both the prelapsarian order under a benevolent **divine condescension** and the postlapsarian economy as one gracious covenant administered through promise, sacraments, and discipline. This intellection grounds later developments rather than standing in contrast to them.

From Heidelberg, Woolsey follows the stream into Scotland and England. **Robert Rollock** and **William Perkins** in the 1590s clarify the **covenant of works** as a pact with Adam promising life upon obedience and death upon disobedience, and they frame **faith** as the sole instrument of participation in the **covenant of grace**. **William Ames’s** 1627 Medulla Theologiae crystallizes the moral logic of the covenants, defining **meritum ex pacto** and expositing how evangelical obedience functions within a gracious order without collapsing justification into sanctification. Woolsey takes pains to show that these English divines maintained a duplex account of **law and gospel** that preserved Protestant soteriology while also elaborating covenantal conditions, thereby rebutting the charge that English federalism became a proto-neonomian legalism. For Woolsey, this stage displays doctrinal maturity that anticipates and informs the **Westminster** documents.

Woolsey’s pivot is the **Westminster Assembly** of 1643 to 1652. He reads **Westminster Confession** chapters 7 and 11 and the **Larger Catechism** as codifying the two-covenant structure with precision. The confession’s language of God’s **voluntary condescension** in covenant, the **covenant of works** with its life promise, and the **covenant of grace** administered under law and gospel in Old and New Testaments, all evidence confessional clarity achieved without innovation. Woolsey emphasizes sacramental **sign and seal** language, infant inclusion, and federal headship in **Adam** and **Christ**. He notes that within the Assembly and its orbit there existed nuanced variation regarding **republication** of the **works principle** at Sinai and the so-called **subservient covenant** associated with **John Cameron**, yet he contends that these were intra-confessional debates about Mosaic administration that did not subvert the unified **covenant of grace**. The upshot is continuity: Westminster did not invent federalism; it refined and stabilized it.

Turning to the Dutch, Woolsey interprets **Johannes Cocceius** and **Herman Witsius** within the same catholic Reformed frame. **Cocceius’s** Summa doctrinae de foedere of the mid-seventeenth century and **Witsius’s** 1677 The Economy of the Covenants show differing accentuations yet consensus on the two-covenant architecture. **Cocceius** presses a dynamic, epochal unfolding of **foedus** and stresses aspects like the **Sabbath** and oath in history; **Witsius** composes a synthetic dogmatics that secures **justification by faith** and distinguishes **law and gospel** with scholastic care. Woolsey resists narrating **Cocceian** developments as a departure and instead reads both Dutch streams as expositing the same **Reformed orthodoxy**, united in affirming **divine simplicity** and **immutability** while allowing for historical economy. On **republication**, he documents how some framed Sinai as republishing the **works principle** for pedagogical and typological ends, while others declined that label, but in either case they upheld the Mosaic economy as an administration of the **covenant of grace**.

A substantial portion of Woolsey’s case directly answers modern historiography. He engages **R. T. Kendall’s** 1979 thesis in Calvin and English Calvinism to 1649 and **Brian G. Armstrong’s** 1969 critique of predestinarian drift, arguing that neither captures the breadth of sixteenth- and seventeenth-century **Reformed** sources. Against **J. B. Torrance** and the broader **Barthian** critique that **federal theology** is structurally legal, he demonstrates that the Reformed doctrine of **meritum ex pacto** safeguards divine generosity and that covenantal conditionality operates within grace rather than alongside it as a competing causal order. His appeal to **Muller’s** description of Reformed **scholastic method** is programmatic: the orthodoxy was methodologically scholastic yet materially biblical and catholic, and its covenantal distinctions were designed to protect **sola gratia** and **sola fide**. Woolsey’s careful handling of terms like *monopleuron* and *dipleuron* covenants clarifies how the Reformed could speak of genuine human response without eroding the unilateral, promissory ground of salvation.

The doctrinal heart of Woolsey’s work is a textured account of the two covenants. The **covenant of works** belongs to creation, not redemption; it is an expression of God’s goodness and rectitude wherein **Adam** as federal head is bound to perfect, personal, and perpetual obedience, with a promised eschatological life implicit in the testing order. Postlapsarianly, the **covenant of grace** is one in substance and diverse in administration, from **Abraham** through **Moses** to **Christ**, the mediator who fulfills the covenantal demands and bestows the benefits through **union with Christ** by **faith**. Within this economy, **law and gospel** cooperate: the law convicts and guides; the gospel promises and grants the Spirit, who enables evangelical obedience as fruit, not ground, of acceptance. Woolsey surfaces how figures like **Ursinus** and **Ames** tie **sacrament** to promise as **sign and seal**, anchoring **paedobaptism** and church discipline in the covenant. Such expositions frame **Westminster’s** formulae as natural culminations of a long tradition rather than a late imposition.

Woolsey’s contribution is not merely antiquarian; it bears ecclesial weight. By showing the early modern Reformed to be both doctrinally stable and pastorally attuned, he recovers a grammar apt for preaching **Christ in all Scripture** without dissolving biblical complexity. His careful survey inoculates against reductionistic binaries in contemporary debates over **republication**, **assurance**, **obedience**, and the so-called **Lordship** question. Where later polemics caricature the **covenant of works** as Pelagian or the **covenant of grace** as antinomian, Woolsey retrieves the classical distinctions that prevent both errors. His work thereby supplies a hermeneutic for reading **Westminster Confession** 7 and 19 in a way that honors the Assembly’s own sources and intent, grounding confessional subscription in historical understanding.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. Woolsey’s retrieval of **unity and continuity** is a major service to confessional theology, and a welcome corrective to the **Calvin versus the Calvinists** narrative. From a **Westminster Theological Seminary** angle, several tensions remain. First, his harmonizing bent may underplay genuine diversity among **Cocceian**, **Cameronian**, and **Owenic** accounts, particularly regarding the Mosaic **republication of the works principle** and the place of typological, intramural works as an administrative layer within the **covenant of grace**. Second, his method is dominantly historical; stronger integration with **Vosian biblical theology** and **Klinean** insights on covenant structure, canon, and intrusion ethics would sharpen how the law–gospel dialectic functions *ad intra* the Mosaic economy while preserving soteriological monergism. Third, while he ably clarifies **meritum ex pacto**, more explicit dogmatic evaluation of merit and assurance vis-a-vis **union with Christ** could help guard against both neonomian drift and antinomian loosening. The preferable alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is not to abandon his continuity thesis, but to complement it: affirm Westminster’s catholic federalism; acknowledge real diversity in the administration of the Mosaic covenant; distinguish redemptive-historical typology from ordo salutis; maintain the **covenant of works** as creational and the **covenant of grace** as redemptive; and give canonical priority to special **revelation** in Scripture as it unfolds the one plan of **covenant grace** through history.
