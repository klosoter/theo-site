### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Bruce L. McCormack emerges in the 1990s as a principal architect of the contemporary return to **Karl Barth** within a wider movement of **neo-orthodox retrieval** and **dialectical theology** reassessment. His intellectual setting is the late modern Protestant academy shaped by **Kantian critical limits**, **post-Hegelian historicity**, and debates over **realism and anti-realism** in theological epistemology. The hallmark of his program is a **historical-dogmatic method** in which doctrinal claims are generated out of careful genetic reconstruction of a theologian’s development. This yields what he calls **critical realism**: the conviction that God is really known in revelation while avoiding naive immediacy by submitting reason to the **analogia fidei**. The guiding thesis across his work is **actualistic ontology**: God’s being is not a static essence but is identical to God’s act of self-determination in **Jesus Christ**. In retrieving Barth for a contemporary audience, McCormack situates him against **Schleiermacherian subjectivism**, **Ritschlian moralism**, and **Thomist substance metaphysics**, while pressing forward a constructive **Christocentrism** that aims to reconfigure **Trinity**, **election**, and **Christology**.

McCormack’s institutional base in the North American mainline and his long teaching career in systematic theology positioned him as a bridge between **German-language Barth scholarship** and English-speaking dogmatics. His rhetorical posture is that of the **intellectual historian** who becomes a constructive theologian only after the historical ground is secured. Yet even his historical theses have dogmatic bite. The emphasis on Barth’s trajectory from 1909 to 1936 ties together a complex conversation with **Kierkegaard’s dialectic**, **Wilhelm Herrmann’s ethical personalism**, **Overbeck’s anti-history** impulses, and a qualified reception of **Hegel’s actuality**. Through these interlocutors McCormack frames a consistent anti-foundational stance in which the **Word of God** constitutes the only access to the **knowledge of God**, thereby rendering **natural theology** and the **analogia entis** theologically otiose.

#### 2. The 1995 thesis: critically realistic dialectical theology
The keystone of McCormack’s influence is his 1995 monograph, **Karl Barth’s Critically Realistic Dialectical Theology: Its Genesis and Development 1909–1936**. The book argues that even as Barth moves from the second edition of **Romans** 1922 to the **Göttingen** 1924–25 and **Münster/Bonn** dogmatics 1926–1933, the deep structure remains **dialectical** and **actualistic**. Barth’s recurrent thesis that **God’s being is in act** is read neither as rhetorical flourish nor as a late development, but as an ontological claim that defines the **doctrine of God** from the outset. The label **critically realistic** signals McCormack’s interpretation of Barth’s epistemology: revelation creates its own categories, yet the objectivity of God’s self-revelation secures realism. In this rendering, the decisive break is with **liberal historicism** and **metaphysical essentialism** alike, a break that sets the stage for McCormack’s later construal of **election** as the ground of **divine ontology**.

This historical work carries constructive implications. By tracing the emergence of a **Christocentric dogmatics** in which the **history of Jesus** is the place where God determines himself to be God-for-us, McCormack prepares the ground for a theological ontology ordered by **election**. The reading emphasizes Barth’s rejection of any speculative **Logos asarkos** considered as a self-standing preincarnate identity detached from the concrete **Jesus of Nazareth**. In the process, McCormack presents a coherent through-line in Barth’s development that makes sense of the transition from dialectical protest to the ordered architecture of the **Church Dogmatics**, while preserving the **dialectic of hiddenness and revelation** as intrinsic to the **doctrine of God**.

#### 3. Grace and Being: election as principium of ontology
The interpretive fulcrum of McCormack’s constructive project appears in the 2000 essay **Grace and Being: The Role of God’s Gracious Election in Karl Barth’s Theological Ontology**. There he contends that Barth’s revision of the **doctrine of election** in **CD II/2** makes election the inner ground of **Trinitarian being**. On this actualistic account, **God elects his own being** to be God-for-us in Jesus Christ; the **immanent Trinity** is not a metaphysical substrate but the living identity constituted by the eternal **decision for incarnation and atonement**. The formula **God’s being is in act** is sharpened to say that the act of election is the principium of the **divine ontology**. Thus **immutability** and **impassibility** are reconceived as the unchanging faithfulness of this decision rather than as immunity from relation. McCormack’s proposal inherits **Eberhard Jüngel’s** axiom that God’s **Sein** is in **Werden**, calibrated to Barth’s insistence that **revelation is reconciliation**.

This reading carries anti-foundational consequences for **natural theology** and the **analogia entis**. If God is who he is only as he gives himself in **Jesus Christ**, then any access to God that is not grounded in this **electing self-determination** would be to posit a second God behind the back of revelation. The **analogia fidei** becomes not simply a hermeneutical principle but an ontological one: the only analogy is the one established by God’s act in Christ. Here McCormack’s **critical realism** functions as a theological epistemology that guards the divine freedom to make himself known while closing off any metaphysical speculation that would ground knowledge of God in creaturely forms abstracted from **grace**.

#### 4. Christology and the proposal of a Reformed kenoticism
From the ontological primacy of **election** McCormack advances a distinctive **Christology**. In essays collected in **Orthodox and Modern** 2008 and in the article **The Humility of the Eternal Son** 2010, he sketches a **Reformed kenoticism**. The aim is to honor **Chalcedonian** two-natures doctrine while taking with full seriousness the **kenosis** of Philippians 2. He argues that the **Logos** determines his eternal identity in view of the history of Jesus, such that the Son’s **obedience** is not an economic add-on but belongs to the eternal mode of the Son’s being. The claim that there is no self-standing **Logos asarkos** is pressed to say that the Son is from eternity the one who will be incarnate and crucified; the anhypostatic-enhypostatic pattern is rendered in a strongly **actualistic** key. This yields a qualified **kenoticism** that refuses any divestment of essential deity while insisting on a genuine self-limitation in the assumption of a **created human nature**.

In this **Reformed kenoticism** the classical **extra Calvinisticum** is retained in a transformed register. The Son is never contained by the flesh, yet the **person** of the Son is identified in and with the history of Jesus such that the full range of human vulnerability, passibility, and growth belong to the concrete subject of the divine Son. The **communicatio idiomatum** is thereby intensified: the cross becomes revelatory of the eternal **humility** and **love** of the Son, not merely of economic mission. Against **Aquinas’s** strong appeals to **impassibility** as pure actuality without potentiality, McCormack leverages **actualistic ontology** to say that God is fully actual in the eternal decision to be for us, a decision that includes within itself the history of **suffering love**.

#### 5. Trinity and the identity of immanent and economic life
Building on **election** and **Christology**, McCormack reconfigures **Trinitarian doctrine**. The immanent and economic persons are not two; the **immanent Trinity** is the **economic Trinity** in the mode of eternal decision. The divine **simplicity** is not a pre-revelatory essence but the integrated unity of God’s triune act. In this frame, **immutability** is constancy of **covenantal faithfulness**, and **impassibility** becomes the refusal of involuntary change rather than a denial of genuine **pathos** in the life of God. The decisive point is that **godness** is known and established in the act of **revelation and reconciliation**; there is no deeper ontological reserve behind the **name of Jesus**.

McCormack’s trinitarian claims draw on **Jüngel** and resonate with aspects of **Pannenberg’s** insistence that divine identity is eschatologically disclosed, yet they remain tethered to **Barth’s** refusal to ground God’s being in world-history. The **decision in eternity** does the ontological work; the historical life of Jesus is the outworking and genuine manifestation of that decision. Thus he rejects any **historicist collapse** of the immanent into the economic, even as he insists on the strict identity between them. The **opera Trinitatis ad extra indivisa sunt** is affirmed as the one triune work of **reconciliation**, while the **missions** reveal the eternal **processions** not by causal derivation but by **electing determination**.

#### 6. Justification, church, and Scripture in a dialectical key
Although best known for **Barth studies**, McCormack also contributes to **soteriology** and **ecclesiology**, especially through the edited volume **Justification in Perspective** 2006. There he champions **forensic justification** as a central **Reformation** insight while engaging ecumenical conversations that stress **union with Christ**. In his hands, the verdict of justification is an act of divine **speech** grounded in Christ’s vicarious humanity, which then gives rise to transformative participation by the **Spirit**. This protects monergism without collapsing **forensic and renovative** aspects. The **Word of God** has pride of place: Scripture is the norming witness through which the living **Christ** addresses and reconstitutes the church in **judgment and grace**.

The church, for McCormack, is the community gathered under the **Word** and continually reformed by **dialectical confrontation** with God’s self-revelation. He reads the **Barmen Declaration** as a programmatic instance of **Christological normativity** over against political and ecclesial idolatries, aligning with **Barth’s** ecclesial ethic. This yields an anti-Constantinian sensibility receptive to **confession** under duress and a hermeneutic of **repentant listening**. Though not a biblical theologian, he advances a dogmatic hermeneutic that prioritizes **Christological centrality** and the **analogia fidei**, skeptical of any canonical construal that would set **nature** or **history** over **grace**.

#### 7. Debates and interlocutors: Hunsinger, Molnar, Crisp, Vanhoozer
McCormack’s proposals have sparked sustained debate among **Barth scholars** and systematicians. **George Hunsinger** contends that the emphasis on **election** as constitutive of divine being risks a **historicized Trinity** and undermines **divine freedom**, preferring to secure Barth’s **Chalcedonian pattern** and traditional **immutability** in stronger terms. **Paul Molnar** argues that McCormack reads **Hegel** into Barth, threatening **aseity** and **eternal generation** by making God’s identity dependent on an ad extra act. In response, McCormack insists that the **eternal decision** is not compelled by the world but is a free, antecedent determination that is itself the locus of **aseity** rightly understood as God’s sufficiency to be who he wills to be.

Beyond Barth studies, analytic theologians such as **Oliver Crisp** engage McCormack’s **Reformed kenoticism**, asking whether eternal **obedience** in the Son is compatible with **homoousios** and with the **volitional unity** of the Trinity. **Kevin Vanhoozer** queries whether **actualistic ontology** obscures the distinction between **theodramatic mission** and **immanent life**, and whether speech-act accounts might better maintain **divine transcendence**. These debates illuminate the pressure points: **simplicity**, **impassibility**, **eternal generation**, and the **creator-creature distinction**. McCormack welcomes the scrutiny, arguing that fidelity to **Barth’s actualism** requires disciplined metaphysical revision rather than mere repetition of **scholastic formulas**.

#### 8. Consolidation and programmatic statements
McCormack consolidates his program in **Orthodox and Modern** 2008, a collection that positions him as both a guardian of **dogmatic orthodoxy** and a critical reader of **modernity**. Essays therein rehearse the stakes of **analogia fidei** against the **analogia entis**, articulate the contours of **election** as **ontological principium**, and defend the viability of **Reformed kenoticism** over against both classical **immobilism** and modern **patripassianism**. His co-edited **Mapping Modern Theology** 2012 provides a pedagogical overview that locates **Barth**, **Jüngel**, and **Pannenberg** within currents of modern thought, while pressing students to engage **doctrine of God**, **Christology**, and **soteriology** with precision oriented by **actualistic ontology**.

A further through-line is his persistent attention to **method**. McCormack advocates a dogmatics that is both historical and constructive, eschewing **confessional repristination** and **free creativity** alike. The **rule of faith** is not a static deposit but the living **Christological canon** arising from the **Word** and applied by the **Spirit**. Consequently, theological language must be chastened by the primacy of **revelation** and the once-for-all **incarnation** as the theater in which God determines himself to be who he is. The result is a consistent actualism that seeks to hold together **divine freedom**, **grace**, and the **uniqueness of Jesus Christ** without appeal to an underlying **metaphysical essence**.

#### 9. Doctrinal contours in summary
Across doctrines, McCormack’s contribution is to make **election** the architectonic center. In the **doctrine of God**, this yields **actualistic ontology**, a reconceived **immutability** as faithfulness, and a reframed **impassibility** as sovereign selfaffection. In **Christology**, it produces **Reformed kenoticism**, the denial of a self-standing **Logos asarkos**, and a heightened **communicatio idiomatum** focused on the singular subject of the **eternal Son**. In **Trinity**, it leads to a robust identity of **immanent and economic** on the basis of eternal **decision**, while insisting that the historical outworking remains the free expression of that decision. In **soteriology**, it secures **forensic justification** by anchoring divine verdict in the once-for-all obedience of the **God-man** and in the **Spirit’s** effectual application. In **ecclesiology** and **Scripture**, it grounds the church’s life in the living **Word of God** and the **analogia fidei**. The unifying wager is that a thoroughly **Christological** and **actualistic** dogmatics is the best hedge against both **metaphysical domestication** and **historicist reduction**.

McCormack’s constructive posture remains self-consciously Barthian yet reaches beyond Barth in making explicit what he judges to be implicit in **CD II/2**. The theological virtues on offer are **clarity**, **coherence**, and an intense focus on **Jesus Christ** as the measure of all God-talk. The risks are equally clear: a near-total dependence on **election** to bear the weight of **ontology**, and a persistent suspicion of the classical **attributes** and **processions** unless reinterpreted through **actualism**. His work sets a high bar for genetic-historical precision and invites ongoing clarification of how **eternal generation**, **simplicity**, and **aseity** can be confessed within an actualistic frame.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theology Seminary vantage, McCormack offers powerful christological focus and a salutary defense of **forensic justification**, yet significant tensions remain. First, the elevation of **election** to the principium of **divine ontology** strains the **creator-creature distinction** by making what is traditionally an ad extra decree constitutive of God’s ad intra life. The Reformed alternative would keep **decree** as the free act of the simple triune God whose **essence** is not constituted by will but undergirds it, thereby preserving **simplicity** and **aseity** without subsuming them under election. Second, the denial of a self-standing **Logos asarkos** risks compromising **eternal generation** and the **extra Calvinisticum** by tethering the Son’s personal identity too tightly to the history of Jesus. Classical Reformed dogmatics maintains that the **person** of the Son subsists eternally in the divine essence, logically and ontologically prior to any decree, while the incarnation is the free realization of the **pactum salutis** among the persons. Third, the reinterpretation of **immutability** and **impassibility** as exclusive moral constancy rather than ontological perfection tends to blur the distinction between **divine act** and **creaturely change**, raising worries about the sufficiency of God in himself. A Westminster-style corrective would affirm the full biblical pathos of God through the language of **covenant condescension** while retaining the traditional doctrine that God is without passions in his essence. Finally, McCormack’s methodological suspicion of **natural theology** and the **analogia entis** may overreach. While the **analogia fidei** must rule theology, the Reformed tradition allows for a ministerial use of **general revelation** and a carefully delimited **natural knowledge of God** that does not compete with **Christological** particularity. In short, McCormack’s **actualistic ontology** sharpens Christological clarity but, absent classical anchors in **simplicity**, **impassibility**, **eternal generation**, and the **pactum salutis**, risks christological expansion at the expense of **Trinitarian** and **metaphysical** stability.
