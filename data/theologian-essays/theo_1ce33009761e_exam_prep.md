### TITLE
James Henley Thornwell is a brilliant but deeply compromised Old School Southern Presbyterian whose confessional ecclesiology and high doctrine of Scripture are inextricably entangled with a theologically rationalized defense of slavery and white supremacy.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **James Henley Thornwell** (1812–1862) ministers in the antebellum and Civil War era American South, within the **Old School Presbyterian** stream and the emerging **Southern Presbyterian Church**.
- Shaped by **Post-Revolution American Presbyterianism** and **Romantic commonsense philosophy**, Thornwell stands at the intersection of confessional Calvinism, sectional crisis, and the cultural defense of the **slaveholding South**.

- Methodologically, Thornwell is a **Princeton-style Old School** theologian who insists on the primacy and inerrancy of **Scripture** interpreted by sound exegesis within the **Westminster Standards**.
- He employs **Scottish Common Sense Realism** and a robust **Reformed scholastic** apparatus, yet he weds these to a culturally conservative reading of **natural law** that normalizes Southern hierarchy.
- Thornwell treats **church history** and **confessions** as subordinate but binding guides, arguing for a strict **regulative principle** not only in worship but in polity and ecclesiastical action.

- In his sermons and essays collected posthumously in **The Collected Writings of James Henley Thornwell** (4 vols., 1871–73), he defends classic **Reformed orthodoxy** on God, Scripture, and salvation while also justifying **slavery**.
- In **The Rights and Duties of Masters** (1850), he argues that biblical **household codes** sanction slavery as a providential institution that can be, in principle, benevolent under Christian masters.
- In his **Report on the subject of Slavery** to the **Presbyterian Church in the United States of America** (1845), Thornwell contends that the church may only condemn what Scripture explicitly condemns, thus denying ecclesial authority to declare **slaveholding** per se sinful.
- His ecclesiological essays around the formation of the **Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America** (1861) articulate a high view of **church courts**, **discipline**, and the church as a spiritual, not political, kingdom.

- Thornwell is decisive for **ecclesiology and church polity**, especially the doctrine of the **spirituality of the church** and the nature of Presbyterian courts.
- He is also a major voice for **revelation and Scripture**, defending biblical authority, inerrancy, and the regulative principle, yet bending these toward the maintenance of a **slave-based culture**.
- His contributions to **church and culture** develop a sharp distinction between church as spiritual institution and the civil sphere, which he uses to insulate **slavery** from ecclesiastical critique.

- For a Westminster exam, Thornwell should be positioned as a rigorously **confessional Old School Presbyterian** whose formal commitments to **Scripture and confessionalism** are undercut by a profoundly sinful misreading of the Bible on race and slavery.
- He must be engaged as a cautionary example of how **Reformed orthodoxy** and a high Bibliology can be co-opted by cultural idolatry, requiring critical discrimination between form and content.

- Compare Thornwell to **Charles Hodge** on Old School **Princeton** orthodoxy versus Southern Presbyterian pro-slavery applications.
- Contrast Thornwell with **B. B. Warfield** and later **Bavinck** on the use of **natural law** and culture, and with **Abraham Kuyper** on church and state, especially the **spirituality of the church** versus neo-Calvinist public theology.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
James Henley **Thornwell** was born in 1812 in South Carolina, converted as a teenager, educated at South Carolina College, and trained theologically at **Andover** and then at **Columbia Theological Seminary**, where he later taught and led. Intellectually, he inhabits the world of early nineteenth century **American Presbyterianism**, marked by the Old School–New School controversies, the influence of **Scottish Common Sense Realism**, and the escalating sectional conflict over slavery. Thornwell becomes one of the most prominent theologians and ecclesiastical statesmen of the Southern Old School, serving as pastor, seminary professor, and moderator of the **General Assembly**. His context is therefore one of confessional consolidation within Presbyterianism on the one hand, and the defense of the **slaveholding South** as a supposed Christian civilization on the other.

The driving problem that shapes Thornwell’s theology is how to maintain what he sees as authentic **Reformed orthodoxy** and church order in the midst of modern fragmentation, democratic egalitarianism, and abolitionist agitation. He believes that both **Arminian revivalism** and **New School** moralism are undermining the sovereignty of God and the spiritual nature of the church, while Northern abolitionists are, in his view, politicizing the gospel and subverting biblical authority. Thus he seeks to articulate a rigorously biblical and confessional **Presbyterianism** that can stabilize doctrine, safeguard the church from cultural revolution, and vindicate the existing social order, including **slavery**, as consonant with divine providence. That attempt to weld confessional fidelity to Southern social conservatism is the great burden, and the great corruption, of his project.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Thornwell’s method is self consciously that of an Old School **Reformed scholastic**, mediated through **Princeton** and Southern Presbyterian institutions. Scripture for him is the inspired and inerrant Word of God, the sole infallible rule of faith and life, to be interpreted according to its own grammatical and historical sense. He insists, much like **Charles Hodge**, that theology is a science which induces doctrinal propositions from the totality of biblical data. He locates himself squarely within the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, treating it as a faithful summary of Scripture and as a binding subordinate standard for the church’s teaching office. He is wary of **experience** as a norm, associating it with revivalist subjectivism, and places minimal weight on speculative philosophy, though he uses **Scottish Common Sense Realism** to underwrite confidence in the reliability of sense perception and rational inference.

With regard to **revelation**, Thornwell affirms a strong doctrine of verbal inspiration and the sufficiency and perspicuity of Scripture. General revelation and **natural law** are real, but the fall has obscured them, so he will not allow them to trump explicit biblical texts. In practice, however, his appeal to natural relations between superior and inferior races and classes reveals that he reads **history and providence** through the lens of Southern culture and then projects that reading back into Scripture. For **reason**, Thornwell adopts the classic Reformed view that reason is a ministerial tool. It can systematize what Scripture teaches but never correct or add to it. Church **tradition** and councils, including the Westminster Assembly and prior Presbyterian bodies, carry great weight, yet they must always be normed by Scripture. He frequently invokes the **ancient church** and the broader catholic tradition when it suits his case, but his primary authorities remain the Bible and the Reformed confessions.

A pivotal feature of Thornwell’s method is his doctrine of the **spirituality of the church**, by which he sharply limits the church’s official voice to matters directly revealed in Scripture that pertain to salvation, worship, and discipline. Civil matters, including the legitimacy of **slavery**, belong to the state and to private Christian prudence, not to ecclesiastical courts, unless Scripture clearly identifies them as sins. This methodological move allows him to argue, as in his **Report on the subject of Slavery** presented to the General Assembly in 1845, that because Scripture regulates slavery without condemning it outright, the church has no authority to declare slaveholding a sin per se. Here the formal Reformed commitment to **sola Scriptura** and the spirituality of the church becomes functionally an instrument to protect a sinful social order from ecclesial critique, revealing a deep tension between Thornwell’s method and a more holistic confessional reading of **law, gospel, and ethics**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

On revelation and Scripture, the classic Reformed baseline is that **Scripture** is the inspired, inerrant, sufficient, and perspicuous Word of God, interpreted within the covenant community and summarized faithfully in confessions such as the **Westminster Standards**. Thornwell underwrites this baseline with great vigor, especially in his sermons and essays collected in **The Collected Writings of James Henley Thornwell** (1871–73). Like **Hodge** and **A. A. Hodge**, he insists on verbal inspiration and defends the unity and harmony of Scripture against rationalist criticism. He also champions a strongly regulated approach to doctrine and worship on the basis of explicit biblical warrant. His interlocutors here are mostly **New School Presbyterians** and more latitudinarian Protestants who give greater weight to moral intuition or the spirit of the age. Yet Thornwell’s use of Scripture is selective and culturally conditioned. When he treats passages like **Ephesians 6** or **Philemon**, he emphasizes the absence of a categorical biblical prohibition of slavery, then absolutizes this silence into a positive divine sanction of the institution, conflating biblical regulation of a fallen arrangement with moral endorsement. This shows how his high view of **revelation** is bent toward justifying Southern social relations.

In ecclesiology and the doctrine of the church, the Reformed confessional baseline is that the **visible church** is the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, invested with the ministry of Word, sacraments, and discipline, distinct yet not divorced from the civil commonwealth. Thornwell’s distinctive contribution is his sharp articulation of the **spirituality of the church**, which he uses both against state intrusion into church affairs and against what he perceives as ecclesiastical overreach into political questions. In various ecclesiological essays and his leadership in founding the **Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America** in 1861, he argues that church courts may only pronounce on issues that are either expressly set down in Scripture or clearly deducible from it concerning faith and practice. He opposes ecclesiastical statements on tariffs, war policy, or even the abstract sinfulness of **slavery**, unless Scripture speaks in the same terms. In debate with Northern Presbyterians like **Albert Barnes** and other anti-slavery voices, he insists that the church must remain spiritual, not political. While this protects the church’s independence from the state, it also functions to silence the church’s prophetic critique of structurally unjust arrangements that are deeply entangled with violations of the second table of the **law**.

Regarding ethics, social order, and the doctrine of man, the Reformed baseline is that all people are created in the **imago Dei**, equal in dignity yet diverse in gifts and vocations, and that civil institutions must promote justice and love of neighbor according to the moral law summarized in the **Decalogue**. Thornwell affirms the image of God, original sin, and total depravity in classical Augustinian and Calvinist terms. However, in works like **The Rights and Duties of Masters** (1850) and related sermons, he develops a hierarchical social ethic in which inequality of condition and subordination of certain classes and races are treated as providential ordinances. He insists that slavery, as such, is not a moral evil, though individual abuses are, and argues that Christian masters have duties of benevolence and instruction to their slaves. His primary opponents are **abolitionists** and some **New School** theologians who argue for the moral sinfulness of the institution itself. Thornwell distinguishes between personal and structural sin in such a way that the structural reality of owning humans is treated as adiaphorous, contingent on how it is practiced. In so doing, he suppresses the Reformed recognition that persistent violations of the second table, such as theft, oppression, and denial of marital and parental rights, can be embedded in social institutions. This is a profound deformation of Reformed **ethics and anthropology**.

In soteriology and grace, Thornwell largely rehearses and defends the classic doctrines of **Reformed orthodoxy**: unconditional election, particular redemption, effectual calling, justification by faith alone, and the perseverance of the saints. His sermons and doctrinal essays align closely with the **Westminster Confession** and are aimed against Arminianism and revivalist subjectivism. He emphasizes the sovereignty of God in salvation, the necessity of regeneration, and the sufficiency of Christ’s atonement for the elect. Here his interlocutors are **Methodists**, **New School Presbyterians**, and emerging moral government theologians who weaken the penal and substitutionary character of the cross. Thornwell’s account of grace is, in formal terms, robust and orthodox. Yet the ethical outworking of this soteriology within a slave society is highly problematic. He can speak movingly of the equal need of masters and slaves for the blood of Christ, while still defending an institution that treats those same image bearers as property. This reveals an internal disjunction between his doctrine of **grace** and his doctrine of neighbor love, where grace does not actually destabilize or critique unjust structures in light of the kingdom of **Christ**.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical Reformed theologians like **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and later **Bavinck** provide the confessional and doctrinal framework within which Thornwell explicitly situates himself, especially on the doctrines of God, Scripture, and salvation. On these loci, he stands in substantial continuity with Reformed orthodoxy and is received by many later Southern Presbyterians as a model of confessional fidelity. However, the same tradition, when read more fully, also provides the resources to critique Thornwell. Calvin’s insistence on the prophetic role of the church, the **Second Helvetic Confession’s** opposition to tyranny and oppression, and **Bavinck’s** rich doctrine of the image of God and common grace all militate against Thornwell’s defense of race based chattel slavery and his narrowed view of the church’s social witness. Later Reformed figures like **Vos** and **Van Til**, with their redemptive historical and antithetical views of culture, also highlight how deeply sin can corrupt cultural norms and how Scripture must be used to challenge, not sacralize, those norms. Westminster type examiners must object concretely to at least two things: first, Thornwell’s theological justification of **slavery** and his failure to recognize it as a systemic violation of the moral law and of the imago Dei; second, his deployment of the **spirituality of the church** in a way that effectively silences the church’s corporate witness against entrenched injustice. At the same time, a Reformed theologian can still learn from his seriousness about **confessional subscription**, his insistence on the authority and sufficiency of Scripture, and his defense of ecclesiastical independence from the state, provided these are disentangled from their sinful cultural applications. Contemporary Reformed reflection on **church and culture** must therefore both acknowledge the formal strengths in Thornwell’s method and decisively repudiate his substantive conclusions on race and slavery.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, the safest opening move is to describe **James Henley Thornwell** as a leading nineteenth century Old School **Southern Presbyterian** who combines a robust doctrine of Scripture and the church with a grievous and sinful defense of slavery. That sentence signals both historical awareness and moral clarity. It is also safe to say that he is an exemplar of confessional Calvinism in form but a cautionary tale in content when it comes to **church and culture**. You can affirm his defense of biblical authority, the **Westminster Standards**, and the spirituality of the church at the level of principle, while immediately adding that his application of those principles served to rationalize white supremacy and race based chattel slavery. Examiners will expect explicit language naming his stance on slavery as a serious theological and moral error, not merely as a cultural blind spot.

There are phrases that must be avoided or heavily qualified. You should not say that Thornwell offers a biblically faithful account of **social ethics** without specifying that his conclusions on slavery are radically unbiblical and contrary to the moral law. Avoid describing him simply as a champion of **sola Scriptura** or the spirituality of the church, since those slogans, without qualification, can sound as if you endorse the way he used them to shield unjust structures from critique. Likewise, do not speak of **natural law** in Thornwell without clarifying that his natural law reasoning was distorted by racist assumptions about racial hierarchy and providential ordering. Any hint that his defense of slavery was merely an unfortunate entailment of otherwise sound exegesis will likely provoke pushback. Instead, emphasize that his exegesis itself was deeply malformed by cultural idolatry.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the notion that Thornwell is simply a Southern **Charles Hodge** with a regrettable social ethic, or that the doctrine of the **spirituality of the church** is inherently racist or pro slavery. The better line is to say that Thornwell shares much of the Old School doctrinal framework with Hodge but radicalizes certain elements of the spirituality doctrine and uses them to blunt the church’s moral witness. You should be prepared to distinguish between a legitimate Reformed concern to keep the church from being co opted by partisan politics, which one can even see in **Vos** and **Van Til**, and Thornwell’s illegitimate insulation of broad questions of justice and neighbor love from ecclesiastical address. Examiners may also test whether you can avoid anachronism while still speaking with moral clarity. It is appropriate to note that many of Thornwell’s contemporaries, including other Reformed voices, recognized slavery as sinful, so his position cannot be excused as universally held. The key is to show that you can articulate his own claims, especially from **The Rights and Duties of Masters** and his 1845 **Report on Slavery**, in his strongest terms, then systematically expose their contradiction with **Reformed confessional** teaching on the law, the image of God, and Christian love.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, we affirm in **James Henley Thornwell** his rigorous commitment to the authority and sufficiency of **Scripture**, his high view of the **Westminster Standards**, and his insistence that the visible church as an institution must not be subordinated to state control or partisan agendas, yet we must unequivocally deny his theological defense of race based chattel slavery, his naturalization of racial hierarchy, and his restrictive deployment of the **spirituality of the church** in ways that mute the church’s corporate witness against manifest violations of the second table of the law; so if asked where we land, the answer is that we gratefully receive his formal confessionalism and aspects of his ecclesiology as reminders that the church’s authority is ministerial and derived, but we decisively repudiate his application of those principles to justify slavery and insist that a truly Reformed use of Scripture and confession requires the church to name such institutions as contrary to the image of God, the law of love, and the kingdom ethics of Jesus Christ.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **James Henley Thornwell** is a leading Old School Southern Presbyterian who weds a robust confessional and biblical theology to a tragically sinful defense of slavery and racial hierarchy.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1812 in South Carolina, educated at South Carolina College and **Columbia Theological Seminary**, and active as pastor, professor, and churchman until his death in 1862.
- His key sermons and essays are collected in **The Collected Writings of James Henley Thornwell** (1871–73), which showcase his doctrinal rigor and Southern Presbyterian commitments.
- In **The Rights and Duties of Masters** (1850) and his 1845 **Report on the subject of Slavery**, Thornwell systematically defends slavery as compatible with Scripture and Christian ethics.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Thornwell adopts an Old School **Reformed scholastic** method that treats Scripture as the inerrant and sufficient source for systematic theology in continuity with the **Westminster Confession**.
- He employs **Scottish Common Sense Realism** to support confidence in reason and sense perception, while insisting that reason remains ministerial and subordinate to biblical revelation.
- His doctrine of the **spirituality of the church** sharply limits ecclesiastical pronouncements to matters clearly revealed in Scripture, which he then uses to bracket slavery from church censure.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On **revelation and Scripture**, Thornwell defends verbal inspiration, inerrancy, and sufficiency, closely aligning with **Princeton Old School** positions while misreading texts on slavery.
- In **ecclesiology**, he develops a strong doctrine of the **visible church** and church courts, emphasizing the spiritual nature of the church in a way that restricts its social and political voice.
- In **social ethics**, he argues in **The Rights and Duties of Masters** that slavery is not inherently sinful, but a providential institution that can be Christianized through benevolent masters.
- In **anthropology and the imago Dei**, he formally affirms human dignity and total depravity but functionally undermines equality by defending racial and social hierarchy as part of divine order.
- In **soteriology**, he upholds classic doctrines of election, atonement, and justification, yet these doctrines do not lead him to condemn structural injustices that oppress fellow image bearers.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press how Thornwell’s defense of **slavery** violates Reformed teaching on the **imago Dei**, neighbor love, and the second table of the moral law.
- They will challenge his use of the **spirituality of the church** to silence ecclesial critique of manifest injustice, contrasting it with a more prophetic Reformed ecclesiology.
- They may question how his appeal to **natural law and providence** is distorted by racist assumptions, in contrast to more careful natural law reasoning in the broader Reformed tradition.
- They will expect you to distinguish between Thornwell’s formal adherence to **Reformed orthodoxy** and his substantive betrayal of that orthodoxy in his social and ethical conclusions.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Thornwell vs Hodge** on Old School orthodoxy, with Thornwell sharing doctrinal method but radicalizing the spirituality of the church in defense of Southern slavery.
- **Thornwell vs Bavinck** on the **imago Dei** and culture, with Bavinck’s rich anthropology exposing the contradictions in Thornwell’s hierarchical social ethic.
- **Thornwell vs Kuyper** on church and state, contrasting Thornwell’s spirituality of the church with **Kuyper’s** neo-Calvinist vision of public Christian engagement.
- **Thornwell vs Vos/Van Til** on culture and antithesis, with Vos and **Van Til** highlighting how cultural idols, including racism, must be prophetically critiqued by Scripture.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- **James Henley Thornwell** is a sobering example of how a formally rigorous Reformed and confessional theology can be commandeered by cultural idolatry to justify grave moral evil, so we must mine his methodological strengths while unequivocally rejecting his defense of slavery.
