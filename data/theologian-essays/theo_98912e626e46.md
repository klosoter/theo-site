### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Daniel I. Block emerges from a mid-twentieth-century world where **British Semitics**, **Mennonite piety**, and **evangelical institutional growth** converged to produce a distinctive kind of Old Testament theologian. Trained in rigorous **Hebrew philology** and sensitive to **ANE backgrounds**, he builds on the legacy of **G. E. Wright** and pushes beyond the dialectical frameworks of **Gerhard von Rad** and **Walther Eichrodt** toward a pastoral and ecclesial orientation akin to **Brevard Childs’s canonical project**. Teaching posts at **Bethel College**, **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary**, and **Wheaton College** positioned him as a bridge between the academy and the church, with a Mennonite-evangelical sensibility that privileges **ethical monotheism**, **covenantal fidelity**, and the formation of a worshiping people under **Yahweh’s kingship**. The methodological anchors are clear: **final-form exegesis** informed by **rhetorical-literary analysis**, a disciplined but non-skeptical use of **historical-critical tools**, comparative insights from **ANE treaty and cult** studies, and a confessional impulse to let **Scripture’s own categories** order dogmatic reflection.

Block’s method displays a consistent refusal of both naïve **biblicism** and reductionist **historicist reconstructions**. The Old Testament is read as a coherent witness to **Yahweh’s covenantal presence**, not as a heap of fragments or mere sociological artifacts. With **Meredith Kline** and **George Mendenhall**, he recognizes the **suzerainty treaty** architecture of **Deuteronomy** yet resists system collapse into ideology by reading the text’s own **rhetoric, poetics, and narrative flow**. The hermeneutical sequence is crucial: first the Hebrew Bible on its own terms, then the canonical placement within **Tanakh**, and finally Christian theological integration that honors **continuity and fulfillment** without erasing **Israel’s voice**. The resultant stance is evangelical and catholic: robust **inerrancy** in service of worship, careful **philology** in service of theology, and historical sensitivity in service of **ecclesial formation**.

#### 2. Ezekiel and the grammar of presence
Block’s signature contribution is the two-volume **NICOT commentary on Ezekiel** 1997 and 1998, a landmark of close **Hebrew exegesis**, textured **theological synthesis**, and sober engagement with **ANE iconography** and **cult**. The controlling motif is **Yahweh’s kabod** and **ruach**: the devastating departure of the **glory** from the polluted temple, the prophet’s commission in the power of the **Spirit**, and the promised return of **divine presence** to a purified sanctuary. Against **dispensational literalism**, Block reads the **Ezekiel 40–48 temple** as a programmatic, idealized architectural theology; against **skeptical minimalism**, he insists on the text’s historical rootedness in **sixth-century exile** and on the concrete hope of **covenant restoration**. He carefully parses **new heart** and **new spirit** 11:19; 36:26 as inner renovation wrought by **Yahweh’s Spirit**, correlating cultic cleansing with ethical transformation so that **holiness** is not ritualism but life reordered under the **kingly God**.

Interlocution with **Eichrodt’s covenant unity**, **Von Rad’s tradition history**, and **Brueggemann’s rhetorical pluralism** sharpens Block’s posture. He retrieves the **mishkan-temple** complex as a theological grammar of **presence** and **rule**, while deemphasizing speculative **apocalyptic chronology**. The NICOT volumes exhibit decisive judgments on **idolatry** and **monotheism**, on **priestly critique** and **royal hope**, especially in his treatment of the **Davidic shepherd** 34 and **Gog** 38–39. Building on iconographic studies, he construes Ezekiel’s polemic against **abominations** as a rejection of the ANE logic of **image mediation**, thereby prefiguring a biblical theology of **image of God** and **anti-idol ethics**. The result is a canonical portrait: the exiled people are reshaped by the **word of Yahweh**, reoriented by **covenant fidelity**, and invited into **worship as life** under the returning **glory**.

#### 3. Law, covenant, and torah spirituality
If Ezekiel established Block’s reputation, **Deuteronomy** animated his theological vision. Through essay collections such as **How I Love Your Torah, O Lord!** 2011 and **The Gospel according to Moses** 2012, and through sustained studies gathered in **By the River Chebar** 2013 and subsequent works, Block advances a thick account of **torah as gracious instruction**, not legalistic burden. Mining **suzerainty treaty** structures, especially the **Esarhaddon** parallels, he reads **Deuteronomy** as a covenantal charter in which **Yahweh’s kingship** is enacted by covenant **stipulations**, and **love of God** Deut 6 is the heartbeat of obedience. He resists **Marcionite** instincts in evangelical piety by emphasizing **continuity** between **Deuteronomy’s ethics** and **Jesus’ kingdom ethic**, framing the Shema and the *ve’ahavta* as deep grammar for Christian discipleship.

Here Block’s Mennonite-evangelical heritage surfaces in a rich account of **ethical monotheism** that prizes **human flourishing** under **divine wisdom**. He highlights **life** as Deuteronomy’s leitmotif, the repeated call to choose **life** in the land by aligning with **Yahweh’s ways**, and he maps the text’s concern for **family**, **neighbor**, **sojourner**, **economics**, and **criminal justice**. In conversation with **Christopher J. H. Wright** on **mission and ethics**, Block shows how **Israel’s covenantal distinctiveness** is simultaneously missional witness to the nations. He draws on **ANE law** comparanda to underscore the humane innovations of Israel’s law, yet refuses to sever **law** from **worship**, insisting that cultic fidelity and moral integrity form a single covenantal vocation. The upshot is a torah spirituality that reads **command** as gift, **obedience** as worship, and **holiness** as wholeness before the **presence of God**.

#### 4. Worship as the church’s vocation
Block’s constructive synthesis appears programmatically in **For the Glory of God: Recovering a Biblical Theology of Worship** 2014, where **worship** is defined as reverential, comprehensive response to **Yahweh’s presence**, encompassing **hearing**, **obedience**, **sacrifice**, **song**, and **service**. Against the reduction of worship to **music performance**, he grounds the church’s worship in **creation**, **covenant**, and **redemption**, tracing the story from **Eden** through **tabernacle** and **temple** to the **Christ event** and **Spirit-indwelt community**. The book’s conceptual anchors are **presence**, **word**, and **sacrifice**: God speaks and draws near, the people listen and draw near, and the resulting life is a holistic **liturgy of obedience**. Drawing from **Ezekiel** and **Deuteronomy**, he balances the **cultic** and the **ethical**, arguing that the Old Testament’s categories must discipline contemporary practice.

In this vision, **sacraments** and **song** serve the larger telos of **glorifying God** in all of life. Block engages **John Walton** on **cosmic temple** themes and aligns with **Childs** in advocating the church’s submission to the **canonical shape** of Scripture for its worship. He tethers **gathered worship** to the **word** and to the **table of obedience**, while not collapsing distinct ecclesial rites into generalized activism. The theological outcome is an evangelical catholicity where **Scripture** orders **praxis**, the **Spirit** animates **obedience**, and **mission** flows from **doxology**. Here the threads of **covenant**, **presence**, and **monotheism** converge: worship is allegiance to the **one God**, enacted in the **one people**, through a **word-shaped life**.

#### 5. Judges, Ruth, and the ethics of fidelity
Block’s **NAC Judges-Ruth** 1999 and **ZECOT Ruth** 2015 extend his canonical-theological profile into narrative ethics. Against romantic and moralistic readings, he treats **Ruth** as a microcosm of **hesed** within the dark horizon of **Judges**. The contrast between **covenantal fidelity** and **anarchy** exposes the cost of **idolatry** and the beauty of **loyal love**, anticipating the **Davidic hope** in canonical context. His supple handling of **Hebrew narrative art** and **legal background** illuminates **levirate** and **kinsman redemption** practices without anachronism, while drawing lines to **messianic genealogy** that stop short of speculative typology. The same method applies to **Judges**: rather than celebrating charismatic violence, Block foregrounds the collapse of **covenant order**, the deformation of **worship**, and the necessity of righteous **kingship** under **Yahweh**.

These narrative studies feed his broader claim that Old Testament story is pedagogy in **monotheistic ethics**. He shows how **Boaz** embodies **torah** generosity, how **Ruth** becomes a gentile exemplar of **covenant loyalty**, and how **Israel’s judges** often parody the very **deliverance** they are called to enact. By keeping **covenant** and **presence** central, he interprets the narratives as doxological and moral instruction for the **church**, displaying a hermeneutic that is historically responsible, canonically sensitive, and pastoral in orientation.

#### 6. Polemic against idolatry, affirmation of exclusive monotheism
In **The Gods of the Nations** 1988 with a second edition in 2000, Block synthesizes biblical and **ANE evidence** to clarify Israel’s claim about **Yahweh** vis-a-vis the gods. While acknowledging ancient patterns of **national deity** and divine warfare, he argues that Israel’s Scriptures articulate an exclusive **monotheism** that transcends **henotheistic** patterns. His theses resist the scholarly tendency to read the Old Testament as moving merely from **monolatry** to **monotheism**, and instead locate in **Deuteronomy** and **Isaiah** a robust confession of the **one God** who alone creates, covenants, and judges. The corollary is a sharp biblical **idol polemic**, which Block aligns with Ezekiel’s critique of images as an affront to **divine presence** and an inversion of human **imago Dei** dignity.

This work reinforces his reading of **worship** as allegiance and **law** as loyal response. It also clarifies his approach to **mission**: Israel’s uniqueness is not ethno-national superiority but the radiance of **Yahweh’s character** in a people formed by **covenant instruction**. Here he interacts fruitfully with **Wright** on **missio Dei**, with **Walton** on **ANE cosmology**, and with **Childs** on the **canonical** coherence of monotheistic confession. The upshot is a theological portrait in which **God’s oneness** grounds **ethical universality** and obliges the church to embody **exclusive loyalty** in pluralist settings.

#### 7. Covenant as integrative frame
Block’s mature synthesis appears in the edited volume **Covenant: The Framework of God’s Grand Plan of Redemption** 2021, where he orchestrates contributions around **biblical covenants** as the architectural frame of Scripture. His editorial hand reflects his own convictions: **covenant** is the thick, biblical category that unites **creation**, **Abrahamic promise**, **Sinaitic instruction**, **Davidic kingship**, and **new covenant** renewal. The catechetical point is clear. A right reading of **gospel** depends on a right reading of **covenant**, and a right reading of **worship** depends on a right reading of **presence** and **law** within covenant. While he does not simply reproduce **federal scholasticism**, he appreciates its instinct to read the whole Bible through **oaths, promises, and stipulations** that bind the **one God** to his **one people**.

At the same time, Block’s covenant discourse is disciplined by exegesis. He avoids flattening the covenants into a single abstraction, and he resists both **dispensational discontinuity** and **supersessionist erasure** of Israel. In conversation with **Kline** and classic **Reformed federalism**, he stresses the **gracious** character of the Mosaic arrangement when read as **torah instruction** within the larger promise plan. The theological payoff is an integrative grammar that can carry **worship**, **ethics**, **mission**, and **ecclesiology** without losing biblical texture.

#### 8. Hermeneutics for the church
Across commentaries and essays, Block advocates a hermeneutic that begins with **textual form**, moves through **historical setting**, and culminates in **theological synthesis** for the church’s life. He challenges both churchly **Marcionism** and academic **skepticism** by recovering **Deuteronomy’s gospel** and **Ezekiel’s Spirit-renewal** as central to Christian confession. The consistent emphases are **Yahweh’s kingship**, **covenant fidelity**, **exclusive worship**, and **ethical holiness**. His prose often closes the gap between **exegesis** and **homiletics**, a trait visible in **The Gospel according to Moses** and **For the Glory of God**, where sermon-ready formulations arise from patient **Hebrew** work.

Block’s interlocutors sharpen his profile. From **Brueggemann** he borrows rhetorical attentiveness while demurring from relativized **polyphony**; from **Childs** he receives **canonical discipline** without allegorical overreach; with **Walton** he shares **ANE sensitivity** while guarding **biblical distinctiveness**; with **Wright** he co-labors on **ethics and mission** while centering the **text’s own categories**. The enduring contribution is a model of evangelical scholarship where **philology**, **canon**, and **church** mutually inform a life of **worship** before the **presence of God**.

In sum, Block’s work rearticulates a classical biblical theology of **presence and covenant** for contemporary readers. He gives the church exegesis that sings, ethics that worships, and worship that obeys, all under the confession of the **one God** whose **glory** fills the earth.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Block’s project wins strong affirmation and invites disciplined clarification. His covenantal instincts support **federal theology’s** intuition that Scripture coheres under **covenant**, and his anti-dispensational reading of the **Ezekiel temple** as **ideal-theological** aligns with **amillennial** and **redemptive-historical** sensibilities. His insistence that **law** is **gracious instruction** resonates with Reformed readings of the **third use of the law**, and his holistic **worship theology** reinforces **sola Scriptura** ordering of church practice. Yet two tensions should be noted. First, the emphasis on **torah spirituality** risks muting the **law-gospel distinction** when theological grammar is not explicit about the relation of **lex** and **evangelium** under the **covenant of grace**; a more precise deployment of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** categories could secure the evangelical edge of his Deuteronomic exhortations. Second, his broad construal of **worship as all-of-life** can blur the Reformed **regulative principle of worship** that distinguishes between the whole-life vocation and the specifically instituted elements of **Lord’s Day** assembly. The Reformed alternative is not less holistic but more carefully layered: **cultus** ordered by **command**, and **culture** ordered by **wisdom**. Within these clarifications, Block’s contributions can be gladly received as exegetical ballast for **covenant continuity**, **Spirit-wrought renewal**, and **word-shaped worship** at the heart of classical Reformed orthodoxy.
