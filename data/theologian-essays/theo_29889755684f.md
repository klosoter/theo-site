### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and vocation
The story of **Michael Green** unfolds within the crucible of **post-war British Anglican evangelicalism**, where university missions, parish renewal, and the defense of **historic orthodoxy** against theological liberalism converged. Educated in the classical tradition of **Oxford and Cambridge** and trained for ministry at **Ridley Hall**, Green absorbed the twin influences of **biblical criticism** at close range and a vibrant student **evangelistic culture** associated with the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union and Inter-Varsity. His early ministry brought him into teaching and leadership at the London College of Divinity and then the principalship of **St John's College, Nottingham** from 1969 to 1975, a key evangelical training institution during the years of charismatic ferment and renewed confidence in **biblical theology**. From 1975 he served as Rector of **St Aldate's Oxford**, a significant urban parish where he embodied parish-centered mission, later holding posts at **Regent College** in Vancouver, as Adviser in Evangelism to the **Archbishop of Canterbury**, and as a Senior Research Fellow at **Wycliffe Hall, Oxford**. The wider scene of the **Lausanne Movement** and the 1974 **Lausanne Covenant** provided a missional grammar that matched Green's instincts for proclamation, apologetics, and social concern held together by **Gospel conviction**.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Green's method is unapologetically practical, but it is anchored in a serious **cumulative case apologetics** that combines historical argument, biblical exegesis, and pastoral invitation. He contends that Christian claims are publicly assessable by the canons of historical inquiry while also insisting on the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**, the internal testimony of the Spirit as the decisive work of God in persuasion. His stance is best described as classical **evidentialist evangelism** channeled through a **biblical-theological** lens rather than through scholastic metaphysics or analytic philosophy. He commends Scripture as **authoritative and reliable**, avoiding polemical formulations about **inerrancy** in favor of the British evangelical language of trustworthiness, apostolic origin, and canonical coherence. Across his corpus, the shape of the *kerygma* is crisp and apostolic, centered on the **death and resurrection of Jesus**, the **lordship of Christ**, and the summons to **repentance and faith**, while his pastoral counsel embraces the ongoing **filling of the Spirit**, discerned **charismata**, and a cautious but affirmative stance toward the **charismatic renewal**.

#### 3. Evangelism in the Early Church
The scholarly centerpiece of Green's legacy is **Evangelism in the Early Church**, published in 1970, a work that argued against the romantic notion that growth was driven mainly by strategic elites or imperial favor. Mining sources from **Acts**, the Apostolic Fathers, and early apologists, Green maintains that the advance of the Gospel depended on the interplay of *kerygma* and *martyria*, formal proclamation and informal witness, embedded within a culture of **holiness, hospitality, and catechesis**. He highlights the role of ordinary believers in marketplace and household, the social credibility of churches that cared for the poor, and the reality of **miracles** as signs that pointed to the **kingdom of God**. The argument establishes his abiding thesis that evangelism is the work of the whole church, fueled by the **Holy Spirit** and authenticated by a distinctive communal life, rather than a clerical guild or a professionalized program. The book pressed evangelicals to retrieve an ancient pattern in which **apologetics**, **pastoral formation**, and **sacrificial witness** are not competitive goods but complementary strands of one **missionary ecclesiology**.

#### 4. The Holy Spirit and charismatic discernment
In **I Believe in the Holy Spirit**, published in 1975, Green provided a balanced evangelical **pneumatology** in the years when the **charismatic renewal** was reshaping British Anglicanism. He carefully distinguishes the **Spirit's regenerating work** in conversion from the varied experiences of **Spirit filling**, concluding that there is one **baptism in the Holy Spirit** coincident with union with Christ but many renewals and endowments for service. He encourages openness to **charismata** such as tongues, prophecy, and healing, yet ties all discernment to **Scripture, love, and mission**, recalling the Pauline test that the Spirit glorifies **Jesus Christ** and builds up the **church**. Green welcomes the missional energy of power encounters yet warns against spectacle, authoritarian leadership, or treating experiences as normative templates. In the background are conversations with **John Wimber** and the Vineyard movement, and the book effectively stakes a middle course: evangelical orthodoxy on **Christ and Scripture** together with a constructive embrace of the **Spirit's gifts** for evangelism and sanctification.

#### 5. Christology under fire and the defense of orthodoxy
In the later 1970s, amid debates stirred by **John Hick** and the volume **The Myth of God Incarnate**, Green emerged as a public defender of classic **Christology**. As editor of **The Truth of God Incarnate** in 1977, he assembled evangelical scholars to rebut claims that the incarnation is merely a mythic symbol rather than the ontological entry of the eternal Son into history. He reinforced the **virgin birth** as a sign of divine initiative, affirmed the **homoousios** Christology of Nicaea, and advocated the historicity and theological necessity of Jesus' **miracles**. Green's strategy remained consistent with his broader method, joining historical argument about sources and early worship with doctrinal clarity about the **uniqueness of Christ** as universal Lord and Savior. This Christological defense is not academic polemic alone. It is evangelistic proclamation in the face of **pluralism**, a way of saying that the real Jesus of the **Gospels** claims real allegiance in the public square.

#### 6. Resurrection apologetics and the credibility of the Gospels
Green's apologetic for the **resurrection** is characteristic of his whole corpus. In **Man Alive** in 1968 and later in **Who Is This Jesus** in 1992, he presses the converging lines of historical probability. He advances the empty tomb attested across early traditions, the multiple appearances to individuals and groups, the transformation of the disciples from fear to boldness, and the density of early creedal material such as **1 Corinthians 15**. The cumulative force of these considerations, joined to the Spirit's working, warrants confident proclamation that God raised Jesus from the dead. On the **reliability of the Gospels**, Green emphasizes early dating, eyewitness connections, the coherence of undesigned coincidences, and the implausibility of wholesale legendary development within the short chronological window available. His approach draws on mentors such as **F. F. Bruce** and engages critics such as **Rudolf Bultmann**, contending that the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith are not separable but one **Lord**.

#### 7. Parish, laity, and the practice of mission
Green's ecclesial strategy reaches a practical synthesis in **Evangelism Through the Local Church** from 1990. Here he envisions the congregation as a school of **witness** with structures for **catechesis**, nurture, and deployment. He stresses the primacy of the **laity** in ordinary networks of friendship and work, the value of **hospitality** as evangelistic plausibility, and the need to train believers in conversational apologetics, prayer, and holistic service. Green commends planned **missions** and citywide evangelistic initiatives while urging the constant cultivation of small groups as the matrix of growth. He engages the question of **power evangelism**, proposing that signs of the **kingdom** can accompany proclamation but must be tethered to teaching and accountability. The parish ministry of **St Aldate's Oxford** serves as a concrete example of his praxis, joining vibrant worship, pastoral care, and intellectual credibility in the university context.

#### 8. Exegesis and the canon for the church
Alongside his missional works, Green contributed to evangelical exegesis through **The Bible Speaks Today** series with **2 Peter and Jude** first published in 1968 and revised in 1987, and later **The Message of Matthew** in 2000. In the former, he situates **false teachers** within the moral and doctrinal laxities of the first century, arguing that apostolic authority and eschatological hope restrain the church from antinomian drift. In the latter, he reads **Matthew** as catechism and mission manual that forms disciples under the **Sermon on the Mount**, culminating in the **Great Commission** that binds worship to worldwide evangelization. His popular level theological reading of **Acts** in **Thirty Years That Changed the World** in 1993 likewise interlaces historical analysis with pastoral exhortation, reaffirming the pattern of **Spirit-empowered witness** through preaching, fellowship, sacrament, and suffering. These writings display Green's conviction that exegesis belongs to the **church's life**, not to the academy alone, and that Scripture itself furnishes the grammar of mission.

#### 9. Institutions, networks, and global reach
Green's influence multiplied through institutions and networks that embodied his core commitments to **evangelism** and **orthodoxy**. As Principal of **St John's College, Nottingham**, he championed training that braided **biblical studies**, **pastoral theology**, and practical mission. His season at **Regent College** placed him in conversation with **J. I. Packer** and wider North American evangelicalism, broadening the scope of his **missional apologetics**. As Adviser in Evangelism to the **Archbishop of Canterbury** under George Carey in the 1990s, Green modeled how an established church can cultivate missionary posture across dioceses. Later at **Wycliffe Hall, Oxford**, he lectured and mentored students in evangelism while assisting college missions worldwide. He engaged the **Lausanne Movement** as a loyal advocate of integrated mission and encouraged tools like **Alpha** as entry points into catechesis, all the while insisting that proclamation must be tethered to robust **doctrine** and sustained **discipleship**. His **Adventure of Faith** published in 2003 reviewed this vocational arc as the interplay of divine providence, institutional responsibility, and personal evangelistic calling.

#### 10. Doctrinal synthesis and Reformed evaluation
Theologically, Green's synthesis is a centrist **evangelical orthodoxy** shaped by a crisp **Gospel**, a high **Christology**, a functional **bibliology**, and a mission-driven **pneumatology**. He affirms the **atonement** with the grammar of substitution and victory, proclaims the **resurrection** as decisive vindication, and reads **Scripture** as a unified canon that generates the church's **missionary identity**. His accounts of **Spirit baptism**, **charismata**, and the discernment of signs aim to keep zeal within the bounds of edification and truth. From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, strengths abound. Green aligns with **sola Scriptura** in practice, with **penal substitution** in preaching, and with **effectual calling** as the Spirit's work that makes the Gospel efficacious. Yet tensions appear at three points. First, his **evidentialist apologetics** sometimes privileges neutral common ground and probability over a **Van Tilian presuppositionalism** that presses the antithesis between covenantal obedience and unbelief, though Green occasionally gestures to the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** as the ultimate ground of assurance. Second, his openness to **charismatic praxis** can underplay the primacy of the **ordinary means of grace**, especially the centrality of the preached **Word** and sacrament within the **covenant community**, though his best counsel does fold gifts back into edification and mission. Third, his ecclesial strategy, shaped by **Anglican parish** realities and pragmatic training, does not foreground **covenant theology** and the redemptive-historical shape of **means, promise, and people** as explicitly as the Reformed confessions would require. A constructive Reformed alternative would commend Green's evangelistic ardor while rooting apologetics in **revelational epistemology**, energizing mission through the **ordinary means** within a robust **covenant** framework, and interpreting power encounters through the primacy of the **Word and Spirit** in the church's gathered worship and scattered witness.
