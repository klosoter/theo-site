### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
D. Glenn Butner Jr. emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** theologian whose work is decisively shaped by the tumult of the 2010s **Trinity debates**. Situated within a broad Baptist and evangelical ecosystem, he is attentive to the biblical, historical, and metaphysical stakes of speaking about the **triune God**. His intellectual context includes the appeal of **social trinitarianism** in late twentieth-century theology, the evangelical turn to **complementarian ethics**, and the retrieval of **classical theism** around **divine simplicity** and **aseity**. Methodologically he combines **dogmatic retrieval** with **analytic clarity**, insisting that theological grammar drawn from **pro-Nicene** sources like **Athanasius**, **Gregory of Nazianzus**, and **Augustine**, as well as **Thomas Aquinas**, provides rules that order exegesis and systematics. He privileges rules such as **one divine will**, **inseparable operations**, and the axiom that the **missions reveal processions**, framing Scripture with the **regula fidei** and the ecumenical councils from **Nicaea** to **Chalcedon** and **Constantinople III**. The result is an approach that binds **biblical exegesis** to doctrinal judgments about **divine simplicity** and **eternal generation**, while distinguishing God’s *ad intra* life from the *ad extra* economy through the classic **processions and missions** nexus.

The galvanizing controversy for Butner’s formation is the evangelical dispute over **eternal functional subordination** or **ERAS**, associated with **Bruce Ware** and **Wayne Grudem**. This debate linked complementarian gender hierarchies to a supposed eternal relation of authority and obedience within the Trinity. Butner enters as a retrievalist critic, drawing on **pro-Nicene** grammar and **dyothelitism** to argue that such a construction is not only exegetically unmoored but dogmatically incoherent. In doing so he converses with fellow retrievalists like **Scott Swain**, **Michael Allen**, **Steven Duby**, and **Matthew Barrett**, as well as historians such as **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios**, while acknowledging the earlier intra-evangelical critique of **Kevin Giles**. His method is disciplined by the metaphysics of **simplicity** and by the patristic logic of **taxis without subordination**, where the Father’s paternity, the Son’s filiation, and the Spirit’s procession establish personal order without any inequality in **deity** or **will**.

#### 2. Key works and programmatic commitments
Butner’s theological profile coheres around two major works. In **The Son Who Learned Obedience** 2018, he offers a full-scale **theological case against eternal submission of the Son**, building a positive account from **Chalcedonian Christology** and **dyothelitism** while showing the conceptual pressures **EFS** places on **divine unity** and **inseparable operations**. In **Trinitarian Dogmatics** 2022, he broadens the frame, presenting the fundamentals of **pro-Nicene grammar** for contemporary readers, expounding **eternal generation**, **simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, **appropriation**, and the **missions-processions** relation. Across essays and reviews he consistently applies these rules to contested texts and doctrines, stabilizing evangelical discourse by returning to **catholic metaphysics** and the **creedal tradition**.

These works display an epistemic stance often described as **canonical-linguistic** and **dogmatic retrieval**. By canonical-linguistic he means that the **canon of Scripture** authorizes a theological language whose meaning is clarified by **creedal** and **conciliar** usage. By dogmatic retrieval he signals an intentional return to the **pro-Nicene** consensus with its doctrinal axioms like **one divine will** and **inseparable operations**. The governing conviction is that **doctrine of God** is not constructed by aggregating biblical proof texts as independent data but by reading texts within the rule-governed, doxological grammar that the church learned to confess as **homoousios** and **processions**. This methodological clarity allows Butner to parse terms such as **authority** and **obedience** with special care, especially when they risk being imported from **creaturely** social analogies into the **immanent Trinity**.

#### 3. The evangelical Trinity controversy and its grammar
The heart of Butner’s contribution is his intervention in the evangelical **EFS** controversy. Proponents claimed that the Son’s eternal relation to the Father includes a functional obedience or submission, correlating this with gender roles. Butner counters by drawing attention to three **pro-Nicene** rules. First, **divine simplicity** entails that God is not composed of parts or really distinct faculties such that a relation of authority and obedience could obtain as if between competing faculties or wills. Second, **one divine will** follows from **simplicity** and **homoousios**, which means that obedience language must be located in the economy or in Christ’s **assumed human will**, not in a supposed eternal submission within the one **deity**. Third, **inseparable operations** and the principle that **the external works of the Trinity are undivided** protect the unity of divine action, even while we confess a true **taxis** in the order of **personal properties** and missions.

Precisely on this grammar, Butner argues that the evangelical turn to **authority-submission** categories in the **immanent Trinity** fails. Because God acts **inseparably**, all divine actions *ad extra* are the common work of **Father, Son, and Spirit**, appropriated according to **personal properties**. It is legitimate to say the Father sends, the Son is sent, and the Spirit is breathed forth, but this **taxis** does not entail subordination. It manifests the eternal **processions** of **paternity**, **filiation**, and **spiration**. To posit a hierarchy of authority and obedience *ad intra* requires either multiple wills in God or a real distinction of faculties contrary to **simplicity**, both of which undercut **Nicene orthodoxy**. These conceptual mistakes reveal how easily social analogies and ethical agendas can distort **trinitarian dogmatics**.

#### 4. Christological focus: dyothelitism and learned obedience
The distinctive contribution of **The Son Who Learned Obedience** 2018 is Butner’s Christological retort to **EFS** through **dyothelitism**. He contends that **Hebrews 5.8** and other obedience texts refer to the incarnate Son who, as **one person in two natures**, possesses a **created human will** and a **divine will**. The **Third Council of Constantinople** affirmed **two wills in Christ** to preserve the fullness of his humanity and the integrity of salvation. Therefore the Son’s obedience is properly the exercise of his **human will** conforming to the **divine will** he shares equally with the Father and the Spirit. This yields a robust, non-subordinationist account of obedience rooted in **Chalcedonian dyophysitism** and **dyothelitism**.

In this frame, **obedience** becomes the drama of the **economy** rather than the ontology of the **immanent Trinity**. The Son’s mission as the one eternally **generated** is fittingly to be sent and to obey according to his **assumed humanity**, fulfilling the **covenant of redemption** or **pactum salutis** as Reformed theology puts it, without positing a hierarchy within the divine life. The sharp analytic payoff is to show that the **obedience language** cannot be back-projected into the **divine processions** without collapsing either the **Creator-creature distinction** or the integrity of **Christ’s two wills**. Butner thus leverages **dyothelitism** not as a historical curiosity but as a controlling doctrinal criterion for trinitarian and Christological coherence.

#### 5. Eternal generation, one will, and inseparable operations
A second pillar of Butner’s project is an apologetic for **eternal generation** as the ontological ground of **personal distinctions** within the **one divine essence**. He follows **Athanasius** and **the Cappadocians** in identifying **filiation** as the Son’s personal property, safeguarding both **equality of nature** and **order of origin**. The talk of **taxis** is secured by **relations of origin**, not by functional subordination. On this basis he clarifies that the **missions** reveal and enact the **processions**, so that the Son’s being sent is an economic disclosure of eternal **filiation**, and the Spirit’s being sent is an economic disclosure of eternal **spiration**. Neither mission implies inferiority, since the missions are common works of the **simple** God appropriated according to **personal properties**.

Here the principle of **one divine will** is crucial. Because there is one **divine essence**, there is one **divine will**, and therefore obedience cannot be an eternal relation between the Father and the Son at the level of will. Butner synthesizes patristic metaphysics with biblical theology to show that the Son does nothing from himself in John’s Gospel not because he is inferior, but because he is **from the Father** according to **filiation** and operates **inseparably** with the Father. This pro-Nicene reading retrieves **Augustine’s** unitary agency and **Aquinas’s** doctrine of **appropriation** as tools for evangelical exegesis. The virtue of this grammar is to give a robust theological account of texts like John 5.19 or 1 Cor 8.6 without recourse to social or hierarchical analogies.

#### 6. Simplicity and the Creator-creature distinction
Butner’s sustained emphasis on **divine simplicity** functions as a boundary marker for evangelical discourse about God. Simplicity insists that God is not a composite of **accidents** or parts, so that God’s **attributes** are identical with the divine **essence**, and the **persons** are subsistent relations not parts. This blocks any move to construe authority and obedience as if God had compartmentalized faculties that could be arrayed in hierarchy. Simplicity also underwrites the **Creator-creature distinction**, guarding against the projection of creaturely social dynamics into the **immanent Trinity**. For Butner, simplicity is not a speculative add-on but the metaphysical entailment of **aseity** and **immutability**, which in turn shield the **gospel** by ensuring that the God who saves in Christ is identical to the God who is.

Within evangelical conversations this simplicity retrieval intersects debates over **theistic mutualism**, **open theism**, and **process relational** views. Butner’s pro-Nicene stance aligns with a growing cadre of evangelical theologians who resist revisions of **classical theism**. He argues that only on a **simple** and **immutable** account of God can one make sense of the **incarnation** and the **cross** as God’s free and sovereign act *ad extra*, rather than the result of any intrinsic need or change in God. This emphasizes the doxological and soteriological stakes of classical **Trinitarian dogmatics**, where the grammar of **inseparable operations** and **one will** secures the unity of divine action in creation and redemption.

#### 7. Scripture, rule, and the missions-processions axiom
Butner’s constructive reading of Scripture uses the **missions-processions** axiom as a hermeneutical guide. He contends that to read the Son’s being sent, or the Spirit’s descent, is to read economic disclosures of eternal **processions**, so that the economy truly reveals God while still respecting the *ad intra* and *ad extra* distinction. The grammar of **appropriation** allows believers to speak truly about the Son’s redemption and the Spirit’s sanctification as works that declare **filiation** and **spiration**. This produces a theological exegesis where Johannine and Pauline texts are read within the **regula fidei**, as **Augustine** and later **Aquinas** exemplify. The approach does not reduce exegesis to metaphysics, but it insists that the **creedal dogma** sets the horizon for faithful reading.

Applied to contested passages, this method defangs **EFS** readings. In John 14.28 the Father is greater than I is read not as an ontological or eternal authority hierarchy, but as a statement of the Son’s **mission** in the economy, fitting to his **assumed humanity** and to the order of **filiation**. In Hebrews 5.8 the Son’s learning obedience is located in **dyothelitism**, preserving the confession that the Son shares the **one divine will**. By maintaining **taxis without subordination**, Butner preserves the rich differentiation of **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit** while enshrining **homoousios** and **inseparable operations** as the markers of orthodoxy. Evangelicals, on this account, must resist importing ethical analogies into the **immanent Trinity** and instead allow the **missions** to catechize them into the divine **processions**.

#### 8. Beyond the controversy: constructive dogmatics
Although catalyzed by **EFS**, Butner’s broader project in **Trinitarian Dogmatics** 2022 seeks to give evangelicals the conceptual **grammar** necessary for durable doctrinal work. He treats the **names of God**, the **divine attributes** under **simplicity**, the **triune relations** as **personal properties**, and the ordering of **missions** in the economy. He draws on **Athanasius** to articulate the soteriological motive for **homoousios**, on **the Cappadocians** to clarify **hypostatic** language, on **Augustine** to expound **inseparable operations**, and on **Aquinas** to order **processions**, **appropriation**, and **taxis**. He also appropriates **Reformed** idioms such as **Calvin’s autotheos** to underscore the Son’s **aseity** according to the divine essence while maintaining **eternal generation** according to **relation of origin**.

This constructive labor aims to stabilize evangelical theology against the volatility of faddish analogies and ethical projects. By anchoring speech in **classical metaphysics** and **creedal** rules, Butner seeks to form theologians who can navigate contested terrains like **atonement**, **pneumatology**, and **divine action** without surrendering orthodoxy. The retrieval is not antiquarian but pastoral and polemical: it is meant to secure the worship of the **triune God** and to guard the church against conceptual muddle. His work thus models a ressourcement ethos in which **biblical exegesis** is disciplined by doctrinal **grammar**, and contemporary questions are addressed from the depths of **catholic tradition**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Butner’s project is a significant contribution to evangelical **dogmatics**. His defense of **eternal generation**, **one divine will**, **dyothelitism**, and **inseparable operations** coheres with **classical Reformed orthodoxy** in **Turretin**, **Owen**, and **Bavinck**, and his clarification of **Calvin’s autotheos** strengthens rather than weakens Nicene commitments by distinguishing **essence** from **relation of origin**. His Christological deployment of **dyothelitism** to interpret **obedience** texts is especially salutary, reinforcing the **Creator-creature distinction** and safeguarding the **gospel**. One may ask whether his reliance on **Thomistic** formulations of **simplicity** fully integrates the Reformed covenantal accent on **pactum salutis**, but his acknowledgement that obedience is economic and covenantal sits comfortably with a federal framework. Reformed concerns about grounding method in **revelation** rather than **speculative reason** are answered by his insistence on the **regula fidei**, **missions-processions** axiom, and the catechetical function of the **creeds**. Where some evangelicals deploy the Trinity for immediate cultural ethics, Butner re-centers theology on **revelation**, **worship**, and the **economy of salvation**, a move that aligns with Westminster commitments to **Scripture’s sufficiency**, the primacy of **covenant history**, and a rigorous **Creator-creature distinction**. The doctrinal alternative he commends to EFS is the classical suite of **eternal generation**, **taxis without subordination**, **one will**, and **inseparable operations**, which provides a more faithful and theologically durable account of the **triune God**.
