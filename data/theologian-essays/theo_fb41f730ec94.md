### TITLE
Retrieving pro-Nicene grammar for evangelical theology: simplicity, processions, and inseparable operations against modern social trinitarianism.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Contemporary British Baptist** in the **St Andrews** context, working amid the late twentieth-century **Trinitarian revival** and postliberal retrieval of **patristic pro-Nicene** theology.
- Method marked by **evangelical sola Scriptura** under a chastened account of the **regula fidei**, privileging **classical theism** and the Fathers' conceptual grammar over **social trinitarian** models.
- Key works: **God of Grace and God of Glory: An Account of the Theology of Jonathan Edwards** (2000); **Listening to the Past: The Place of Tradition in Theology** (2002); **The Quest for the Trinity: The Doctrine of God in Scripture, History and Modernity** (2012); **Baptist Theology** (2012).
- Central categories: **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, **relations of origin** and **eternal generation**, distinctions between *theologia* and *oikonomia*, and critique of **person** as modern psychology.
- Interlocutors: critical engagement with **Moltmann**, **Rahner**, **Zizioulas**, **Gunton**, **Ware** and **EFS/ERAS** advocates; constructive alignment with **Augustine**, the **Cappadocians**, **Athanasius**, and retrieval scholars like **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios**.
- Reformed cue: strong consonance with **Reformed orthodoxy** on **simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **inseparable operations**, with Baptist divergences on **covenant** and **sacramentology** inviting **WTS**-style evaluation.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Stephen R. Holmes emerges as a **contemporary Baptist** theologian whose center of gravity is the retrieval of **pro-Nicene trinitarian** doctrine for **evangelical** churches. Teaching at the **University of St Andrews**, his intellectual formation unfolded in the shadow of the late twentieth-century **Trinitarian renaissance**, shaped by the bold constructive programs of **Karl Barth**, **Karl Rahner**, **Jürgen Moltmann**, and **Colin Gunton**, yet decisively critical of their departures from **classical theism**. Holmes situates his method within **sola Scriptura** while insisting on the indispensability of the **regula fidei**, the shared catechetical and liturgical framework of the ancient Church, as the hermeneutical key that enabled the Fathers to confess **homoousios** without collapsing biblical narrative into metaphysical speculation. He privileges patristic conceptual tools like **inseparable operations** and **relations of origin** over modern relational or social accounts of **personhood**, thereby realigning evangelical theology with **Augustine** and the **Cappadocians**.

Holmes's program is not antiquarian. He argues that the modern West imported a psychological and juridical sense of **person** that distorts the **trinitarian** grammar of **hypostasis** and **relation**, generating **social trinitarianism** ill-suited to uphold **divine simplicity**. Against this, he insists on the Fathers' disciplined exegesis, where *oikonomia* interprets *theologia*, and the scriptural pattern of the one God's *opera ad extra* grounds the confession of the three, not through direct inference from human community but via **inseparable operations** and **appropriations**. In method, then, Holmes combines historical-theological retrieval with evangelical **doctrinal chastity**, refusing speculative extensions beyond the **rule of faith**.

#### 2. Early work on Edwards and the stakes of classical theism
Holmes's first major monograph, **God of Grace and God of Glory: An Account of the Theology of Jonathan Edwards** (2000), placed him within the stream of **Reformed** and **evangelical** ressourcement. Reading **Jonathan Edwards** as a deep metaphysician of **divine simplicity** and **trinitarian** beauty, Holmes articulated Edwards's commitment to the one God's plenitude and the ordered processions of **generation** and **spiration** as the wellspring of **creation** and **redemption**. This study both anticipated and motivated Holmes's later insistence that modern attempts to democratize the **Trinity** by analogy to human society imperil the divine **aseity** that Edwards guarded.

In Edwards Holmes found a theologian who located the church's worship and the believer's holiness within the radiance of **triune glory**, yet did so without surrendering **impassibility** or **immutability**. By presenting **Edwards** as a constructive ally for contemporary evangelicalism, Holmes positioned classical **theism** not as a scholastic relic but as the grammar that secures **grace** as truly divine gift rather than historical projection. The doctrinal stakes were thus set: either one recovers the **pro-Nicene** grammar that yields **inseparable operations** and **divine simplicity**, or one risks a functional tritheism under the banner of relational community.

#### 3. Tradition as theological instrument
With **Listening to the Past: The Place of Tradition in Theology** (2002), Holmes clarified his method. He argued that **tradition**, rightly received, is neither a second source of revelation nor an autonomous authority but a Spirit-shaped habit of reading under **Scripture**, enshrined in the **creeds**, lectionary, and doxological life. He invoked the **regula fidei** as a hermeneutical habitus that teaches how to read Scripture toward **theologia**, warning that without such rules, appeals to the Bible become captive to modern categories of **person**, **freedom**, or **society**. This account simultaneously resists both sectarian **Baptist biblicism** and magisterial claims to infallible tradition, an evangelical middle path that echoes **Vincent of Lérins** while maintaining **sola Scriptura**.

Holmes's retrieval of **patristic** logic includes the grammar of **appropriations**, the logic by which Scripture can say the **Son** is sent while the **one God** acts indivisibly in **creation**, **redemption**, and **sanctification**. He deploys this grammar to discipline contemporary claims that particular attributes belong to distinct persons, a move that would violate **inseparable operations** and erode **simplicity**. The result is a methodological manifesto: theology advances by rereading Scripture within catholic habits, not by importing late-modern metaphysics of relation.

#### 4. The Quest for the Trinity: diagnosis and retrieval
Holmes's signature work, **The Quest for the Trinity: The Doctrine of God in Scripture, History and Modernity** (2012), offers a sweeping diagnosis. The book contends that the twentieth-century recovery of **Trinity** often misfired, trading the **pro-Nicene** contract in favor of **social trinitarianism**, thereby neglecting **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **inseparable operations**. He reads **Moltmann**, **Pannenberg**, **Zizioulas**, and **Gunton** as inspirational but fundamentally revisionist, because they define **person** by relationality and divide the *opera ad extra* among the persons in a way that compromises the unity of the one **ousia**.

Against these modernities, Holmes retrieves the Fathers' two-step. First, the confession that the works of **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit** are **inseparable** and thus the works of the one **God**. Second, the insistence that the **three** are distinguished not by functions but by **relations of origin**: the **Son** is eternally generated and the **Spirit** eternally spirated. These rules, grounded in **Athanasius** and the **Cappadocians** and systematized by **Augustine**, secure **homoousios** while explaining why the economy features missions that are fitting though inseparable. Holmes's pastoral aim is apparent: re-teach evangelical churches that confessing **eternal generation** and **procession** is not optional, because these relations of origin are the only orthodox trinitarian differentiations that leave **simplicity** intact.

#### 5. Scripture, economy, and the grammar of persons
A crucial exegetical chapter in Holmes's work defends reading the Trinity from Scripture by way of *oikonomia* to *theologia*. He argues that the Bible presents the one **Lord** acting through the **Son** in the **Spirit**, a pattern that licenses the confession of the three not as direct metaphysical data but as the only faithful construal of the narrative. The hermeneutical rules are **inseparable operations**, **appropriations**, and **fittingness** or *convenientia*. From this perspective, the New Testament language of the **Father** sending the **Son** does not introduce **eternal subordination**, because missions are signs of relations and involve the one **God** acting indivisibly.

Holmes is especially clear that the patristic use of **person** translates **hypostasis**, a term of concrete subsistence without modern psychological freight. Recasting **person** as modern subject dissolves **simplicity** and suggests three centers of consciousness, inviting **tritheism**. By contrast, the Fathers' persons are relationally ordered by **processions** and mutually indwell by **perichoresis**, yet without separate wills or energies. This is why Holmes resists claims that the **Father's** monarchy entails authority over the **Son**: such a picture confuses *ad intra* relations of origin with *ad extra* roles and so offends **inseparable operations**.

#### 6. Engaging EFS and evangelical debates
In the heat of evangelical controversy from 2015 to 2017, Holmes stood against **EFS/ERAS** proposals associated with **Bruce Ware** and **Wayne Grudem**, arguing that positing an eternal authority-submission relation in **God** violates **Nicene** grammar. He insists that any subordination in the *ad intra* life implies an inequality of **power** or **glory**, contravening **homoousios**. For Holmes, the economic submission of the incarnate **Son** belongs to the **assumed human nature**, not to an eternal role that would torsion the **divine will**. He buttresses this with **inseparable operations** and **one will** accounts drawn from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, though deployed in a Baptist evangelical register.

This polemic is not merely negative. Holmes uses the EFS debate to catechize evangelicals in **eternal generation**, **procession**, and the doctrine of **missions**. He presses the axiom that missions reveal processions, not hierarchies of power. His constructive invitation is to return to the **creeds**, confess **divine simplicity**, and let **relations of origin** do the differentiating work. In this way Holmes calls evangelical theology to trade popular models for **pro-Nicene** logic that has stood centuries of conciliar testing.

#### 7. Baptist theology and ecclesial practice
Holmes's **Baptist Theology** (2012) sets his doctrinal commitments within a tradition of **believers' baptism**, **congregational polity**, and **liberty of conscience**. He portrays Baptist distinctives as ecclesial enactments of core evangelical convictions rather than departures from **catholic** doctrine. The **ordinances** of baptism and the Lord's Supper are framed as means by which the **triune God** communicates grace in the gathered church, though without the sacramental ontology of **ex opere operato**. He treats **covenant** as organizing motif for Baptist identity, yet he resists reading Baptist practice as a novel soteriological scheme that would displace the **creedal** core.

Holmes places **mission** and **discipleship** at the heart of Baptist ecclesiology, arguing that congregational discernment under **Scripture** is most faithful when shaped by the **regula fidei**. He thus seeks to correct **free church** antitraditionalism while preserving **congregational** participation. This ecclesial portrait is consistent with his doctrine of **God**. Only a robust **pro-Nicene** confession can underwrite worship that is truly directed to the **Father**, through the **Son**, in the **Spirit**, and only a theological account ruled by **simplicity** and **inseparable operations** can keep the church from functional tri-theism in liturgy and mission.

#### 8. Doctrine of God in broader systematics
Beyond the Trinity, Holmes defends **divine impassibility** and **immutability** as biblical-catholic judgments about the Creator's mode of being. He reads the cross as the **impassible** God's entry into suffering through the **assumed humanity** of the **Son**, safeguarding **aseity** while affirming the profundity of **kenosis** without a change in the **divine nature**. In creation he emphasizes **ex nihilo**, the creator-creature distinction, and the ordering of providence by the simple **divine will**, aligning with **Reformed orthodoxy**. Soteriologically, he underscores the primacy of the **incarnation** and **atonement** as the single work of the one **God**, thereby resisting partitioned trinitarian roles that compromise **inseparable operations**.

Holmes's insistence on traditional grammar extends to liturgy and prayer. Addressing prayer to the **Father**, through the **Son**, in the **Spirit** embodies **pro-Nicene** convictions about missions and processions. The doxological shape of theology serves as both method and criterion, a stress already visible in **Edwards** and carried forward in **Quest for the Trinity**. Here, too, his critique of **social trinitarianism** has pastoral import: it seeks to recalibrate worship away from projection of human community and toward contemplation of **triune life** as revealed in **Scripture** according to the **rule of faith**.

#### 9. Interlocutors and constructive dialogue
Holmes engages modern giants with measured clarity. From **Rahner** he values the axiom that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, but he warns that reading the rule without **inseparable operations** risks modalism. From **Moltmann** and **Zizioulas** he appropriates a concern for communion but rejects defining **person** by relation in a way that fragments **simplicity**. With **Gunton** he shares a desire to retrieve **patristic** insights yet contests the dismissal of **Augustine** and the **Latin** tradition. He receives **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios** as allies in recovering the **pro-Nicene** pattern of scriptural reasoning that subordinates all modern categories to **relations of origin** and **divine unity**.

In evangelical debates, Holmes aligns with critics of **EFS** like **Kevin Giles** and **Fred Sanders**, though his own contribution is more directly a retrieval of **Nicene** conceptual grammar than a sociological or hermeneutical protest. He frames these dialogues as catechetical tasks for churches, repeatedly exhorting pastors to teach **eternal generation**, **procession**, and **inseparable operations**. The result is a constructive ecumenicity: a **Baptist** theologian championing the catholic **doctrine of God** for the life of evangelical congregations.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and specifically **WTS** perspective, Holmes is a welcome ally in the defense of **classical theism**, **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, **eternal generation**, and **inseparable operations**. His commitment to reading **Scripture** within the **regula fidei** resonates with **confessional** instincts and guards against the voluntarist or social drift that imperils **homoousios**. Yet there are tensions to note. First, his account of **tradition** risks according the patristic grammar an epistemic role that could be construed as quasi-normative alongside **Scripture**, whereas **Reformed** theology prefers to speak of the **Westminster Standards** as subordinate norms that norm because they summarize Scripture, not because of catholicity per se. Second, as a **Baptist**, Holmes's **covenant** and **ordinance** theologies diverge from **Reformed** sacramentology and federal theology, leaving questions about the integration of **Trinity**, **covenant of grace**, and **means of grace**. Third, his rhetorical reserve about **Rahner's Rule** might be pushed further in a **WTS** register to insist that covenantal revelation sets the categories for *theologia*, not metaphysics drawn even from the Fathers. A Reformed alternative presses the priority of **special revelation**, **covenant** as the architectonic principle, and **autotheos** in **Calvin** to secure the **Son's** aseity within **simplicity**. Even so, Holmes's retrieval is a salutary corrective for evangelicals, and his pro-Nicene discipline is a constructive partner for a confessional **Reformed** dogmatics.
