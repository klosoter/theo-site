### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the problem he set out to solve
Peter Enns emerged from the world of late twentieth-century **evangelical biblical studies**, receiving an **MDiv at Westminster Theological Seminary** and a **PhD in Near Eastern languages and civilizations at Harvard**, where he studied under scholars like **James Kugel** in **Second Temple exegesis** and ancient reception history. He taught **Old Testament** at **Westminster Theological Seminary** through the 1990s and 2000s, a confessional setting shaped by **Warfield’s inerrancy**, **Vos’s redemptive-historical method**, and **Van Til’s presuppositionalism**. That crucible, alongside the expanding reach of **ANE comparative literature** and **historical-critical** work on the Hebrew Bible, set the stage for Enns’s lifelong question: how can a recognizably ancient, diverse, and sometimes internally disputatious canon be confessed as **God’s Word** without structural dishonesty or reduction of its **human particularity**. The post-**Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** era heightened pressures to defend Scripture’s precision against modern challenges; Enns’s early exposure to **mythic idioms**, **ancient cosmologies**, and **Second Temple hermeneutics** convinced him that the inherited evangelical grammar of **propositional inerrancy** lacked sufficient elasticity. His WTS years culminated in controversy, especially after the publication of **Inspiration and Incarnation** in 2005, leading to his departure in 2008. This history of reception frames his distinctive contribution: a public case for an **incarnational Scripture** that hallows the Bible’s ancientness rather than apologetically domesticating it.

At the level of method, Enns presents himself less as a speculative dogmatician and more as an exegete shaped by **ANE context** and **Second Temple literature**, insisting that **ancient textual worlds** are not peripheral background but the very air the biblical authors breathed. This yields a stance of **epistemic humility**, a posture he later codifies pastorally in **The Sin of Certainty**, arguing that trust in God outruns tidy doctrinal alignment. This posture is theologically articulated through **divine accommodation**, a classic theme from **Calvin** that Enns radicalizes by refusing to insulate Scripture’s antiquity from its authority. In programmatic terms, he attempts to relocate the doctrine of Scripture from the register of **modern precision** to the register of **wisdom** and **historicity**, where the canon functions as an ongoing conversation rather than a univocal manual. In short, his early formation and conflicts thrust him into the role of a progressive interpreter of **revelation** who de-centers **inerrancy** and foregrounds **historicity, diversity, and development** within the canon.

#### 2. The incarnational model and the crisis of evangelical bibliology
The cornerstone of Enns’s theological project is an **incarnational model of Scripture**, the central thesis of **Inspiration and Incarnation**. The analogy is simple and provocative: just as Christ is fully divine and fully human, so **Scripture** is fully divine and fully human. Enns leverages this analogy to license the Bible’s **ancientness** and **contextual particularity** as intrinsic to inspiration rather than as kinks requiring harmonization. The book organizes the evangelical crisis of Scripture into three problem-sets. First, **ANE parallels** expose shared cosmologies, legal forms, and wisdom conventions that call into question claims of radical uniqueness. Second, the Bible’s **internal diversity and tension** appear in chronicled differences, say, between **Chronicles and Samuel-Kings**, and in divergent theological perspectives among **Proverbs, Job, and Ecclesiastes**. Third, the **apostolic use of the Old Testament**, drawing on *midrash* and *pesher* patterns of **Second Temple hermeneutics**, seems to misread or at least recontextualize the Old Testament when measured by modern historical-grammatical strictures. Enns reframes these as features of inspiration. The **divine voice** speaks in and through **human idioms**, including **mythic cosmology**, **ancient law codes**, and **non-modern interpretive practices**. The punchline is a recalibration: the doctrine of **inspiration** must be capacious enough to account for Scripture’s **deep cultural situatedness**.

Enns’s **incarnation** analogy is governed by **divine accommodation** and **progressive revelation**, yet it departs from classical evangelical **inerrancy** by decentering the category of error. He argues that the Bible’s authority resides not in concordist alignment with modern historiography or science but in its capacity to bear the **wisdom of faith** through time. The analogy’s strength is phenomenological candor: the Bible we actually have bears marks of **composite authorship**, **editorial layers**, and **canon-in-dialogue**. Its risk is doctrinal slippage, since the **hypostatic union** is a unique **Christological** event, not a generic template; still, Enns wields the analogy as a hermeneutical permission slip to embrace the **humanity of Scripture** as the God-intended vehicle of its **divine address**.

#### 3. Case studies: Exodus, Adam, and the wisdom reframe
Enns’s earlier **Exodus** volume in the **NIV Application Commentary** series (2000) serves as a practical staging ground for his method. He treats **Exodus** as an ancient narrative freighted with theological memory rather than as a historiographic dossier inviting modern forensic adjudication. He carefully engages **ANE law codes** such as the **Code of Hammurabi** to illumine **Covenant Code** parallels, reads **divine name theology** in Exodus 3 as a disclosure of presence rather than metaphysical essence, and wrestles with the **hardening of Pharaoh** within an ancient framework of **divine sovereignty and human agency**. The hermeneutical move is consistent: acknowledge **ancient form and function**, then press forward to contemporary **theological application** without erasing historical alterity. The commentary clearly models **accommodation** and **contextualization** as hermeneutical virtues, and insists that the **authority of Scripture** is not compromised by its frank embeddedness in the world of **Egyptian, Mesopotamian, and Levantine** cultures.

The program’s most contested extension appears in **The Evolution of Adam** (2012), where Enns argues that the biblical figure **Adam** is not a necessary historical forebear in a modern genealogical sense but a **theological archetype** and literary figure functioning within **ancient origin stories**. Drawing on **Genesis** as **mytho-history** and on **Second Temple** patterns evident in **Paul**, Enns contends that Paul’s use of **Adam** in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** reflects the interpretive repertoire of his age rather than a binding claim on modern biological history. The thrust is twofold: first, affirm **evolutionary science** without false war with Scripture; second, relocate **original sin** and **death** within a broader **Israel-story** where **Adam-Israel** paradigms figure humanity’s vocation and failure. Enns thus presses a **christotelic reading** in which the meaning of **Adam** is ultimately indexed to **Christ**, while loosening the insistence on a single **historical Adam** as the only faithful construal of **federal headship**. The move here marks a critical decision point: Scripture’s truth is affirmed as **theological wisdom**, while its ancient cosmology and origin idioms are treated as **accommodated vehicles** rather than inerrant deliverances on scientific or primeval facticity.

The pastoral sequel to these hermeneutical moves is seen in **The Bible Tells Me So** (2014) and **The Sin of Certainty** (2016). Enns aims at the evangelical habit of turning the Bible into a **rulebook** to beat back ambiguity. He argues that Scripture itself trains readers to handle **diversity, tension, and moral complexity**, for instance in wrestling with **divine violence** and the conquest of **Canaan**, or negotiating divergent portraits of **wisdom** across **Proverbs, Job, Ecclesiastes**. The epistemic thesis is simple but insistent: biblical faith is **trust in God** rather than the possession of **error-proof propositions**. He terms this emphasis **wisdom over certainty**, nudging readers toward a chastened, pilgrim **epistemology** that lives with unresolved questions. The through-line from **Inspiration and Incarnation** to this pastoral counsel is the embrace of **historicity** and **ambiguity** as means of divine pedagogy rather than threats to **authority**.

The synthetic articulation arrives in **How the Bible Actually Works** (2019), whose subtitle advertises its program: an **ancient, ambiguous, and diverse** book that leads us to **wisdom** rather than to **answers**. Enns here systematizes the canon’s internal dialogue, highlighting how **Proverbs** commends cause-effect order, **Job** interrogates it, and **Ecclesiastes** dismantles presumptions of control. He foregrounds **trajectory hermeneutics**, arguing that even **Jesus** and the **apostles** model adaptation and reapplication rather than strict repetition, transforming themes like **enemy love**, **Gentile inclusion**, and **Sabbath** by appeal to the **Spirit-led** telos rather than the letter. The point is not antinomianism but **christotelic fulfillment** that legitimates faithful creativity. For Enns, the canon’s authority thus functions canonically as **conversation**, not as a single register of legal codification. He argues that the Spirit forms **practical wisdom** and **character** through a polyphonic Scripture that mirrors the messy work of **sanctification** in history.

#### 4. Hermeneutics, interlocutors, and method on the ground
Behind these case studies stands a robust hermeneutical thesis. Enns insists that **Second Temple hermeneutics** were not modern historical-grammatical exercises but creative rereadings that included *midrashic* expansion, *pesher*-style fulfillment claims, and typological recontextualization. Consequently, **apostolic hermeneutics** must not be judged by modern canons of authorial intent; their theological legitimacy is measured by their **christological telos** and **ecclesial fruitfulness**. This yields Enns’s preference for **christotelic reading** over a flat **christocentrism** that assumes the Old Testament human authors necessarily intended New Testament meanings. The shift reframes the **unity of Scripture** as a unity-in-movement, crystallized in **Christ** without demanding that the Old Testament match a singular, prior meaning. Enns thereby sketches a doctrinal posture for **progressive revelation** that privileges how the canon is finally deployed by the church rather than how it began.

In dialogue, Enns frequently cites **James Barr** as a patron of linguistic realism against conservative lexical apologetics, and he engages **Brevard Childs** at the point of **canonical shaping**, though he declines Childs’s stronger **canonical unity** claims. He shares instincts with **Walter Brueggemann’s** attention to **testimony and countertestimony**, appreciating intrabiblical dispute as theological strategy. In criticism, evangelical confessionalists like **Gregory Beale** and **Vern Poythress** read Enns as eroding **inerrancy** and undermining **apostolic exegesis**. More mediating voices such as **Kevin Vanhoozer** have pressed a **speech-act** account of **inspiration** that can host **genre** and **ancient idiom** without jettisoning **truthfulness**. Enns for his part argues that such mediations often revert to **harmonization** that tacitly treats ancientness as a problem to be solved rather than as a divine choice to be honored. The result is a fairly stark methodological divide: **incarnational accommodation** with foregrounded **ambiguity** versus **organic inspiration** with foregrounded **coherence**.

Beyond the guild, Enns’s public work through **BioLogos**, the **Bible for Normal People** podcast, and church-facing resources like **Telling God’s Story** has amplified his **science-and-faith** posture and pastoral emphasis on **wisdom**. He has become a symbol of **progressive evangelical** recalibration, particularly among those navigating **deconstruction**. In this sphere, the signature axioms are clear: the Bible’s **ancient cultural embeddedness** is a feature, not a bug; **violence texts** and moral dissonance are to be read with **mature discernment**; **trust** is a virtue superior to **certitude**. This public posture flows directly from the scholarship, which is why disputes over **bibliology** have pastoral stakes in Enns’s project.

#### 5. Doctrinal development: from inspiration to theology proper by way of Scripture
Although Enns is not a systematician, his bibliology implies positions across **theology proper**, **anthropology**, and **soteriology**. If **inspiration** is keyed to **incarnation**, then **divine speech** is thoroughly **historical** and **economic**, refracted through the contingencies of culture and time. This tacitly de-emphasizes classical **immutability** and **impassibility** as governing attributes of revelation, privileging instead **condescensio** and **kenotic** modes of divine self-presentation. On **anthropology**, Enns’s reading of **Adam** disrupts traditional **federal headship** grounded in a single primal pair, suggesting instead that the **Adam-Israel** motif and **Christ’s resurrection** accomplish the theological work of diagnosing and healing human plight without committing to a **biological primeval history**. On **soteriology**, the accent falls on **participation in Christ** and **Spirit-led wisdom**, not on tight logical necessity between **historical Adam** and **original sin**. These developments depend on a **canon-in-dialogue** model, where **Pauline** argument is seen as an inspired example of **Second Temple** reasoning toward **Christ**, not as an epistemic straightjacket for modern readers.

This doctrinal ripple effect reaches **ecclesiology** and **authority**. If the canon is a **conversation**, then the church’s role is a continuation of canon-shaped **deliberation** under the **Spirit**, where **tradition** serves but does not terminate the conversation. Enns thus welcomes pluralism within **orthopraxy** and emphasizes **wisdom** as a communal virtue. The authority of the **church’s confessions** is respected as historical counsel but subordinated to Scripture’s **polyphony** and the **Spirit’s** ongoing direction. By the logic of his program, even **confessional revision** is a sign of biblical fidelity, provided it moves along the **christotelic** arc toward **love of God and neighbor**.

#### 6. Strengths, vulnerabilities, and the shape of his legacy
The principal strength of Enns’s project is descriptive candor about the Bible’s **ancientness**, **literary diversity**, and **interpretive history**. By fully integrating **ANE parallels** and **Second Temple hermeneutics**, he resists classic conservative reflexes toward **harmonization**, inviting a mature **hermeneutical realism** that can say both that God speaks and that God speaks through time-bound idioms, sometimes in mutually critical voices. The pastoral payoff is his recalibration of **faith** as **trust** and **wisdom** rather than intellectual mastery, a move that has aided many who feel crushed by the weight of **inerrantist** apologetics. His framing of **evolution** as compatible with **Genesis** read as **mytho-history** has given evangelical readers an accessible path to reconcile **science** and **Scripture** without cynical dismissal of either.

The vulnerabilities of the project are equally clear. The **incarnational analogy** for **inspiration** risks overextension from **Christology** to **bibliology**, potentially collapsing Christ’s **hypostatic union** into a catch-all justification for canonical tensions. By de-centering **inerrancy** and treating the canon’s authority as **conversational**, Enns risks relativizing **doctrinal normativity**, making theological method overly dependent on perceived **canonical trajectories** whose direction can be contested. His **christotelic** claim that apostolic exegesis need not be anchored in **Old Testament authorial intent** can appear to underwrite a hermeneutic license that the **Westminster** tradition would resist. Finally, in displacing a **historical Adam**, Enns shoulders a significant reconstructive burden for **original sin** and **federal representation**, ventures he prosecutes with theological prudence but which remain controversial beyond his progressive audience.

#### 7. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Enns’s signal insight is also his point of tension: his insistence that the **humanity of Scripture** is intrinsic to **inspiration** rightly retrieves **divine accommodation**, yet his execution tends to subordinate **truthfulness** to **historicity** and **ambiguity**. The **Westminster Confession of Faith 1** affirms the **inspiration**, **sufficiency**, and **clarity** of Scripture across all ages, and the **organic inspiration** model in **Bavinck** and **Warfield** holds together the Bible’s **historical particularity** with its **inerrant** reliability in all that it affirms, according to **genre** and **authorial discourse**. Enns’s project rightly pressurizes any brittle harmonization and welcomes **ANE** and **Second Temple** contexts, but his **incarnational** analogy risks misfiring by making the Bible’s **ancientness** the governing principle of authority rather than **God’s covenantal speech** accommodated to ancientness. A Reformed alternative would grant **mythic idiom** and **composite redaction** while maintaining **inerrancy** as covenantal **truthfulness**, deploying **speech-act theory** to distinguish locutions, illocutions, and perlocutions so that **genre** controls **truth-claims** without lapsing into relativism. On **Adam**, a Reformed path would explore **archetypal/ectypal** distinctions and **federal** representation, allowing symbolic depth and ANE resonance while retaining a **historical Adam** tethered to **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** as undergirding the **covenantal drama** of sin and grace. On hermeneutics, the Reformed **analogia fidei** would welcome **christotelic fulfillment** within the unity of **covenant history** without uncoupling apostolic readings from **authorially intended trajectories**. In short, Enns’s stress on **wisdom** and **accommodation** is a salutary warning against defensive biblicism, but a fully Reformed response secures those gains inside a more robust account of **revelation** as God’s self-communicative act in and through history, preserving **canonical coherence**, **doctrinal normativity**, and **ecclesial confession** as the stable frame for faithful interpretive flexibility.
