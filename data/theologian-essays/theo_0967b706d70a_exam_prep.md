### TITLE
John Murray gives Reformed theology a rigorously exegetical, covenantally structured account of salvation and ethics that deepens Westminster orthodoxy in the modern era without capitulating to modernism.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Born 1898 in **Scotland**, trained in the **Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland**, and teaching at **Westminster Theological Seminary** from 1930 to 1966, Murray works amid fundamentalist–modernist tensions and the rise of neo-orthodoxy.
- His intellectual context is early twentieth century **Reformed confessionalism** under pressure from **liberalism** and **Barthian** theology, plus the institutional struggles of the **OPC** and Westminster.

- Murray’s method is a self-consciously **exegetical theology**, subordinating system-building to patient handling of biblical texts in works like **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied**.
- He practices a restrained **biblical theology** indebted to **Geerhardus Vos**, yet aims explicitly at systematic formulation in continuity with **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**.
- He is wary of speculative **philosophical theology**, so he emphasizes the normative authority of **Scripture** and the *ordo salutis* as exegetically derived rather than scholastic inheritance.

- In **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** 1955, Murray expounds penal substitution, definite atonement, and a carefully nuanced *ordo salutis* grounded in union with **Christ**.
- In **The Epistle to the Romans** 1959, he gives a dense commentary that reshapes discussions of **justification**, **sanctification**, and **union with Christ** in the English-speaking Reformed world.
- In **Principles of Conduct** 1957, he develops a biblical **ethic of creation and redemption**, defending the continuing normativity of the moral law and clarifying issues like divorce and the fear of God.
- His posthumous **Collected Writings of John Murray** gather crucial essays on **covenant theology**, the **covenant of works**, the Adamic administration, and the free offer of the gospel.

- His most decisive impact is in the doctrines of **soteriology** and the *ordo salutis*, including **union with Christ**, definitive sanctification, effectual calling, and perseverance.
- He also significantly shapes twentieth century **covenant theology** and debates over the **covenant of works**, as well as Reformed **ethics** and Christian conduct.
- He reinforces a high view of **Scripture** and confessional authority, and he clarifies the nature of **justification** and **imputation** against both Arminian and Barthian tendencies.

- A Westminster examiner expects you to present Murray as a paradigmatic **confessional Reformed** theologian whose slight departures, such as his formulation of the **covenant of works**, are internal refinements not foundational rejections.
- You should show how Murray strengthens classical **Reformed orthodoxy** against **Arminianism** and **neo-orthodoxy**, while still needing some clarification on law–gospel and covenantal categories.

- Be ready to compare Murray’s **covenant theology** and *ordo salutis* with **Herman Bavinck** and **Louis Berkhof** on one side and **Karl Barth** on the other.
- You should be able to contrast Murray’s **union with Christ** and justification with both **Calvin and Turretin**, and to relate his biblical-theological instincts to **Geerhardus Vos** and **Van Til** on revelation and history.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
John Murray was born in **1898** in Sutherland, in the Scottish Highlands, and raised within the rigorously confessional **Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland**, a separatist body committed to the **Westminster Standards** and opposed to the ecclesiastical compromises of the late nineteenth century. He served in the **First World War**, losing an eye in combat, then studied at the **University of Glasgow** and the **Free Church College** in Edinburgh, where he absorbed the Scottish Reformed tradition represented by **James Orr** and **James Denney**. In 1927 he crossed the Atlantic to study under **J. Gresham Machen** and **Geerhardus Vos** at **Princeton Theological Seminary**, just as Princeton was torn by the fundamentalist–modernist controversy that led to the formation of **Westminster Theological Seminary** in 1929.

Murray joined the faculty of **Westminster Seminary** in 1930 and taught systematic theology there until 1966, participating in the formation of the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** and working alongside figures like **Cornelius Van Til** and **Ned Stonehouse**. His life and work are shaped by the need to defend and restate classic Reformed doctrines of **revelation, atonement, and salvation** in the face of liberal theology, Barthian neo-orthodoxy, Arminian revivalism, and antinomian distortions. The central driving problem in Murray’s theology is how to articulate the saving work of **Christ** and its application to the elect in a way that is at once deeply exegetical, rigorously confessional, and pastorally compelling for the modern church.

This driving problem surfaces in his focus on **soteriology** and **ethics**, where he seeks to show that doctrines like penal substitution, definite atonement, total depravity, and the binding authority of the moral law are not relics of a bygone scholastic era, but arise naturally from faithful exposition of **Scripture**. Through works like **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** and **Principles of Conduct**, Murray contends against both modern subjectivism and moral laxity, aiming to recover a concrete, covenantal, and Christ-centered understanding of redemption and Christian life within the church’s historical confession.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Murray’s method is best described as **exegetical Reformed dogmatics**, where **Scripture** is not only the supreme norm but also the driving engine of doctrinal construction. Influenced by **Vos**, he is sensitive to the historical unfolding of **revelation**, yet he never allows biblical theology to displace systematic theology. In the introduction to **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** he insists that the doctrines of atonement, calling, justification, and glorification must be derived from close attention to the vocabulary, structure, and redemptive-historical context of biblical texts like **Romans 3–8** and **John 10**, rather than from pre-established philosophical systems.

For Murray, **revelation** is covenantal, verbal, and redemptive-historical, given in the inscripturated Word and culminating in **Christ**. He shares **Van Til’s** suspicion of autonomous **reason** and natural theology, though he is less programmatic in his critique. Murray’s use of reason is ministerial rather than magisterial; logic serves to clarify what Scripture teaches and to relate doctrines coherently, but it never functions as an independent norm. **Experience** has a subordinate place; in his essays on assurance and perseverance, he deals with the believer’s subjective struggle, yet always under the control of objective gospel promises. The **church** is the context and recipient of theology, especially as the confessional church; Murray operates within the **Westminster Confession**, but he does not hesitate to refine or adjust its formulations when he judges Scripture to require this, for example in his discussion of the **covenant of works**.

History is significant for Murray’s method, but he does not major on historical retrieval the way **Bavinck** does. Rather, he selectively engages earlier **Reformed scholastics**, most clearly in his treatment of the *ordo salutis* and of **covenant theology**. In essays reprinted in the **Collected Writings**, he interacts with theologians such as **Turretin** and **Hodge**, often defending their basic positions while slightly adjusting terminology or order based on exegesis. Tensions with classical Reformed method appear mainly in his relative lack of metaphysical discussion and his preference for textual and covenantal categories over more scholastic distinctions. Yet he remains within the orbit of classical theism and traditional doctrines of God, largely assuming rather than rearguing the positions of **Calvin** and **Westminster** on divine simplicity, immutability, and aseity.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus
On **soteriology and the atonement**, the Reformed confessional baseline is that Christ’s death is a **penal substitutionary atonement**, offered to God in the place of the elect, satisfying divine justice and securing the efficacious redemption of those whom the Father has given to the Son. In **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** 1955, Murray gives one of the twentieth century’s clearest expositions of this classic doctrine, arguing that the cross is both expiatory and propitiatory, that it actually secures salvation rather than merely making it possible, and that it is particular or definite in its design. Engaging opponents such as **Amyraldians**, Arminians, and modern moral influence theorists, as well as responding to more cautious defenses of substitution like **Denney**, Murray insists that the language of **redemption, reconciliation, and propitiation** in Scripture carries a transactional and substitutionary meaning that cannot be reduced to subjective moral effect. He also clarifies that the atonement must be viewed within the larger *pactum salutis* and covenantal framework, grounding its efficacy in the intra-Trinitarian counsel of **Father, Son, and Spirit**.

On the *ordo salutis* and **union with Christ**, the Reformed baseline affirms a logical order in the application of redemption, including calling, regeneration, faith, justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification, while insisting that all benefits flow from Christ. Murray develops this in a distinctive way by emphasizing **union with Christ** as the overarching reality that structures the entire *ordo*. In **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied** and in his **Romans** commentary 1959 he argues that believers are united to Christ both federally and vitally, and that all saving benefits are aspects of this union. He adjusts some traditional Reformed wording, for instance arguing that **regeneration** and effectual **calling** are not strictly separable, and introducing the category of **definitive sanctification** to describe the once-for-all breach with sin that occurs at conversion, particularly expounded from **Romans 6**. In doing so he interacts implicitly with older Reformed voices like **Hodge** and explicitly with more contemporary Wesleyan and Keswick views of sanctification, rejecting crisis-oriented second blessing schemes in favor of a definitive and progressive sanctification grounded in union with Christ.

Regarding **justification and imputation**, the confessional Reformed view teaches that God justifies the ungodly by imputing the **righteousness of Christ** received by faith alone, apart from works, and declares the believer righteous by a forensic act grounded solely in the obedience and satisfaction of Christ. In polemic with both Roman Catholic teaching and the more ambiguous positions of **Barthian** theology, Murray in his **Romans** commentary and essays in the **Collected Writings** defends the imputation of Christ’s obedience and the strictly forensic character of justification. He argues strongly for the distinction between **justification and sanctification**, while locating both within union with Christ. He addresses debates over the so-called **active and passive obedience** of Christ with a certain reticence about scholastic labels, yet he firmly maintains that Christ’s whole obedience, both in life and death, is reckoned to the believer. His major interlocutors here include **Barth**, whose rejection of a doctrine of imputation he criticizes, and contemporary Lutheran and neo-orthodox treatments that threaten the forensic clarity of justification.

In **covenant theology**, the classical Reformed baseline, summarized in the **Westminster Confession**, speaks of a prelapsarian **covenant of works** with Adam promising life upon perfect obedience, and a postlapsarian **covenant of grace** in Christ for the salvation of the elect. Murray, in essays collected in volume 2 of the **Collected Writings of John Murray**, expresses reservations about the terminology **covenant of works**, preferring to speak of the **Adamic administration** and cautioning against any suggestion of merit that would compromise the Creator–creature distinction or the gracious character of all divine dealings. He does not deny a probationary arrangement with Adam or the reality of federal representation, and he affirms a law–promise structure with eschatological reward, but he nuances the idea of merit and proposes alternative language. His interlocutors here include earlier Reformed theologians like **Herman Witsius** and contemporaries such as **Louis Berkhof** and the Dutch-American tradition, as well as internal Presbyterian debates about the **covenant of works** during the **OPC** controversies. Some later readers have taken Murray’s reservations as a rejection of the covenant of works, while more sympathetic interpreters see him as seeking to sharpen and protect the doctrine against misconstruals.

Finally, in **ethics and the Christian life**, the baseline Reformed view maintains that the moral law, summarized in the **Ten Commandments**, remains normatively binding for believers, and that sanctification involves grateful obedience to God’s law empowered by the Spirit. In **Principles of Conduct** 1957, Murray defends the continuity of the moral law and the abiding significance of creation ordinances, such as marriage, Sabbath, and labor, against both antinomianism and liberal ethical revisionism. He argues for the enduring validity of **the Decalogue**, including the fourth commandment, and he addresses contested issues like **divorce and remarriage**, the fear of God, and the Christian’s relation to culture. Interacting with contemporary ethicists and biblical scholars, as well as older Reformed writers like **Calvin**, he emphasizes that grace restores and elevates nature, rather than abolishing created norms. His ethics thus reinforce a high doctrine of **sanctification** closely tied to Scripture and covenant, and they helped shape later Reformed discussions of law, gospel, and Christian morality.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Murray stands self-consciously within the stream of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**, drawing particularly from **Calvin**, the **Westminster Standards**, and the older Princeton tradition represented by **Hodge** and **Warfield**. Like **Turretin**, he affirms unconditional election, definite atonement, total depravity, irresistible grace, perseverance of the saints, and the covenantal shape of God’s dealings with humanity. His defense of penal substitutionary atonement, forensic justification, and the binding authority of the moral law is essentially a restatement and fresh articulation of confessional Reformed convictions in the context of twentieth century challenges from liberalism, Arminianism, and neo-orthodoxy.

At the same time, Murray’s work shows significant continuity with the biblical-theological emphases of **Vos**. His focus on redemptive history and on **union with Christ** anticipates and influences later developments in Reformed biblical theology. His doctrine of definitive sanctification, for example, draws heavily on exegesis of **Romans 6** and reflects a concern to do justice to the once-for-all character of the believer’s break with sin while maintaining the classic Reformed doctrine of progressive sanctification.

From a Westminster perspective, there are at least two areas where examiners will push back or seek clarification. First, Murray’s hesitancy about the term **covenant of works** and his preference for other formulations can appear to undermine a central structural feature of Reformed federal theology. A candidate must insist that, despite terminological reservations, Murray upholds the reality of a prelapsarian probation, federal headship, and an eschatological reward principle that distinguishes law and gospel, and should be willing to say that any outright denial of a covenant of works would be a significant deviation from **Bavinck** and **Turretin**. Second, his relatively underdeveloped doctrine of **natural law** and creation order, in comparison with **Bavinck** or **Calvin**, may open questions about the foundations of Christian cultural engagement and common grace, though his insistence on creation ordinances and moral law goes some distance toward addressing this.

On the positive side, Reformed theologians can learn much from Murray’s integration of **exegesis and dogmatics**, his insistence that systematic theology must always be reformable according to Scripture, and his example of a confessional theologian who is unafraid to refine traditional categories like the *ordo salutis* and covenant terminology. His emphasis on **union with Christ** as the framework for understanding justification, sanctification, and glorification has deeply influenced later Reformed authors and provides a rich resource against both antinomianism and legalism. Subsequent Reformed scholarship, including work at **Westminster Seminary**, has widely received Murray as a standard bearer of conservative Reformed theology in the twentieth century, while engaging critically with details of his covenant theology and ethical conclusions.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, it is safe and strategic to open by saying something like, **John Murray is a twentieth century Reformed theologian at Westminster Seminary who recast classic doctrines of atonement, justification, and sanctification in intensely exegetical and covenantal terms, especially in Redemption: Accomplished and Applied.** Such a sentence signals awareness of his context, his school, his method, and his major contribution. You can also safely describe him as a **confessional Presbyterian** who sought to defend and clarify the Westminster theology in the face of modern challenges and as an heir of **Machen** and **Vos** who prioritized Scripture in all doctrinal formulation.

There are also phrases and emphases that you must avoid or qualify. Do not say that Murray **rejected the covenant of works**; instead, say that he **questioned the terminology and certain merit formulations of the covenant of works, while affirming an Adamic administration with probation, federal headship, and eschatological promise**. Avoid implying that he replaced justification with **union with Christ** in a way that would blur the forensic character of justification; say instead that **Murray integrates justification into the broader reality of union with Christ while preserving its forensic distinctness**, and contrast this, if needed, with more problematic trajectories in some recent so-called **unionist** readings of Paul. You should not attribute to him any form of **universalism**, **Barthian actualism**, or a denial of imputation; stress his strong defense of **imputed righteousness** and penal substitution against **Barth**.

Examiner traps often involve overstating Murray’s innovativeness or underestimating his confessional solidity. Some students assume that his emphasis on **definitive sanctification** implies a quasi-perfectionism or a second-blessing scheme, which an examiner may exploit by asking about Wesleyan or Keswick views. You should answer that Murray introduced definitive sanctification precisely to refute second-blessing theology and to ground holiness in the once-for-all union with Christ described in **Romans 6**. Another misunderstanding is to imagine that Murray is a kind of biblicist who disregards historical theology. In response, you should underline his appreciation for **Reformed scholastics** and the **Westminster Standards**, even as he allows exegesis to refine traditional labels and orders. Finally, do not portray him as a full-scale innovator in **covenant theology**; rather, present him as an internal critic and improver within the federal tradition, standing much closer to **Calvin and Turretin** than to any revisionist or progressive schools.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, John Murray is to be warmly affirmed as a paradigmatic twentieth century **Reformed dogmatician** whose work on **atonement, justification, union with Christ, and ethics** remains deeply serviceable for the church, precisely because he weds robust confessional commitments to rigorous exegesis and a covenantal reading of Scripture, so we should stand with him in defending penal substitution, definite atonement, imputed righteousness, the abiding validity of the moral law, and the centrality of union with Christ, while also qualifying his hesitancy about the **covenant of works** by insisting that a real prelapsarian probationary covenant with Adam, structured by law and promising eschatological life, is non-negotiable for maintaining the law–gospel distinction and the federal parallel between Adam and Christ; thus if asked where we land, we should say that we embrace Murray’s soteriology and ethics almost wholesale, appreciate his exegetical refinements of the *ordo salutis* and sanctification, but we self-consciously situate his covenant theology within the broader Reformed consensus of **Calvin, Turretin, and Bavinck**, retaining the covenant of works terminology while welcoming his cautions about misconstrued merit.

- His **Collected Writings of John Murray** gather major essays on **covenant theology**, soteriology, and ethics that shaped later Reformed thought.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Murray practices an **exegetical theology** where Scripture’s verbal, covenantal revelation is the supreme and controlling norm for doctrine.
- He uses **reason** ministerially, not autonomously, and views **experience** and history as subordinate to the inscripturated Word and the church’s confession.
- Influenced by **Geerhardus Vos** and **Van Til**, he integrates biblical theology and redemptive history with classic **Reformed dogmatics**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In **Redemption: Accomplished and Applied**, Murray defends **penal substitution**, definite atonement, and a carefully ordered *ordo salutis* grounded in union with **Christ**.
- He emphasizes **union with Christ** as the overarching reality from which justification, adoption, sanctification, and glorification flow.
- He introduces and popularizes **definitive sanctification**, arguing from **Romans 6** that believers have a once-for-all break with the dominion of sin.
- In his **Romans** commentary, he robustly upholds **forensic justification** by the imputed righteousness of Christ received through faith alone.
- In **Principles of Conduct**, he defends the abiding normativity of the **moral law** and creation ordinances, shaping Reformed **ethics** on issues like marriage and divorce.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press whether Murray’s critique of the term **covenant of works** risks undermining classic federal theology and the Adam–Christ parallel.
- They may probe whether his strong emphasis on **union with Christ** threatens to blur the forensic distinctness of **justification**.
- They could question his relative silence on **natural law** and the relation of nature and grace, compared with **Bavinck** or **Calvin**.
- They will test that you distinguish Murray’s **definitive sanctification** from Wesleyan or Keswick second-blessing perfectionism.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- Compare **Murray vs Barth on atonement and justification**, with Murray defending penal substitution and imputation against Barth’s more Christological actualism.
- Compare **Murray vs Bavinck on covenant theology**, with Bavinck clearly affirming the **covenant of works** and Murray nuancing its terminology.
- Compare **Murray vs Berkhof on the ordo salutis**, where Murray refines the order and adds **definitive sanctification** within the classic Reformed structure.
- Compare **Murray vs Vos** on method, with both united in redemptive-historical exegesis yet Murray more focused on dogmatic and ethical formulation.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- John Murray stands as a paradigmatic twentieth century **Reformed theologian** whose exegetically driven soteriology and ethics should be warmly received, while his covenantal refinements are best read as internal cautions rather than departures from the classic **covenant of works and grace** framework.
