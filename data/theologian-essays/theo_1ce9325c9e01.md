### ESSAY
Steven R. Harmon’s enduring contribution lies in a patiently argued **Baptist catholicity** that refuses both **nuda scriptura** biblicism and ecclesial amnesia, while also resisting capitulation to any metanarrative that would compromise **sola scriptura** rightly ordered. In a generation when many Baptists defined themselves against **creeds** and **tradition**, Harmon proposes a retrieval of the **regula fidei** as a hermeneutical habit for reading **Scripture** in the communion of the **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic church**. His thesis is polemically quiet but strategically ambitious: a free-church people can become a traditioned community without surrendering Baptist convictions, thereby serving the **visible unity** sought by **ecumenical** instruments like **BEM 1982** and **The Church: Towards a Common Vision 2013**.

#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Formed within late twentieth-century **Baptist** academic life in the United States and active in the **Baptist World Alliance** and the **World Council of Churches Faith and Order Commission**, Harmon writes from a lived ecumenical environment in which **conciliar** documents, bilateral dialogues, and grassroots ecclesial practices intersect. The intellectual climate is postliberal and postconservative, with **George Lindbeck**’s cultural-linguistic account and **Alasdair MacIntyre**’s traditioned rationality supplying grammar for a chastened **modern** mind. Harmon’s milieu includes the turbulence of American Baptist identity after denominational realignments, alongside global **Baptist** encounters with **Orthodox**, **Catholic**, **Pentecostal**, and **Reformed** partners.

Methodologically, Harmon advances a **regula fidei hermeneutic**: the ancient **rule of faith** functions as a communal lens through which **Scripture** is read, prayed, and confessed. He invokes **lex orandi, lex credendi** to argue that ecclesial worship and creedal confession shape doctrine and vice versa. This is not an elevation of **tradition** to a co-norm with **Scripture** but an insistence that the Spirit-indwelt church’s reception of the apostolic **kerygma** is the God-given context for biblical interpretation. Harmon’s **receptive ecumenism** underscores that traditions best serve catholicity by receiving healing gifts from other traditions, especially where their own practices are fragile, all while maintaining **Scripture’s sufficiency** as the norma normans.

#### 2. Key works and their strategic thrust
Harmon’s program takes its classic form in **Towards Baptist Catholicity: Essays on Tradition and the Baptist Vision 2006**, a compact but architectonic volume. There he maps how **Baptists** can recover the **Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed**, the **Apostles’ Creed**, catechesis, and liturgical forms as subordinate norms that guide biblical reasoning. The book targets the slogan **no creed but the Bible** by distinguishing **solo scriptura** from **sola scriptura**, arguing that *sola* presupposes a communal habit of reading that the ancient **regula fidei** and **creeds** summarize. He contends that selective retrieval of **patristic** consensus offers Baptists thicker resources for **Trinitarian** and **Christological** clarity, ecclesial discipline, and **Eucharistic** piety without violating free-church polity.

In **Ecumenism Means You, Too: Ordinary Christians and the Quest for Christian Unity 2010**, Harmon translates academic argument into pastoral idiom. The focus shifts from theories of **tradition** to practices of **spiritual ecumenism** drawn from **Unitatis Redintegratio** and embodied in local congregations: prayer for unity, study of **BEM** loci on **baptism**, **Eucharist**, and **ministry**, joint acts of mercy, and disciplined mutual recognition of **baptism**. The work introduces lay readers to **conciliar koinonia**, urging participation in the Spirit’s unifying work without diminishing confessional integrity. For Harmon, ordinary **Baptists** become agents of **catholic** rapprochement where they learn to confess the **creeds**, receive the other’s gifts, and examine their own practices in light of **Scripture** and the wider church.

His most mature ecclesiological synthesis appears in **Baptist Identity and the Ecumenical Future: Story, Tradition, and the Recovery of Community 2016**, which reframes **Baptist identity** as a storied participation in the one apostolic **traditio**. Harmon employs **doctrinal development** in a **Newman**-inflected but distinctly Baptist register: development is judged by fidelity to the **regula fidei**, catholic consent, and sanctified prudence, never by a raw historicism. The book explores the **threefold ministry** and **episcopacy** as ecumenical questions, proposing that **apostolicity** can be recognized as continuity in apostolic **faith, mission, and sacramental life**, even where historic episcopate is not adopted. The volume’s hallmark is a multi-layered account of **conciliarity** wherein **local congregation** and wider **communion** mutually constitute catholic fellowship.

#### 3. Theological loci: Scripture and tradition
On **Scripture and tradition**, Harmon advances a nuanced **sola scriptura revisited**. Scripture is the Spirit-breathed canon, the church’s norma normans, yet Scripture is never an abstract archive. The **regula fidei** is a Spirit-fashioned interpretive habit audible in **creeds**, **liturgies**, and catecheses, and so the church’s reception of the canon functions as a providential guardrail. Harmon echoes **Jaroslav Pelikan**’s distinction between **tradition** and **traditionalism**, preferring a living **traditio** that hands on apostolic truth while pruning cultural accretions. He contends that **Baptists** commonly possess functional traditions, from congregational **polity** to hymnody, and that candor about these traditions permits critical appropriation of catholic resources for clearer **Trinitarian**, **Christological**, and **pneumatological** confession.

Harmon’s critique of **nuda scriptura** aims at ecclesial isolation. Without the **creeds** and the **rule of faith**, exegesis risks thinness or novelty, especially regarding **Trinitarian processions**, **Christ’s two natures**, and the **Spirit’s personhood**. He commends regular use of the **Nicene Creed** in Baptist worship as a way to form a people capable of reading Scripture in communion with the saints. The hermeneutic is ecclesial yet accountable: catholic commitments are continually tested by exegesis and the gospel’s center, never immunized from reform. His use of *subsistit in* as a cautious gloss on where the church subsists presses Baptists to ask how their congregational forms share in the one **church** without claiming to be the whole.

#### 4. Ecclesiology: koinonia, conciliarity, and apostolicity
Harmon’s **ecclesiology** is framed by **koinonia** as the communion of the triune God shared with the people of God. He draws on **WCC Faith and Order**’s koinonia ecclesiology to argue that congregational autonomy must be reconceived as mutual responsibility within the wider **communio**. The **local congregation** is fully church by the presence of the **Word**, **sacraments**, and **discipline**, yet not the whole church, for catholicity requires translocal bonds, shared discernment, and reception. Harmon’s **conciliar** vision is modestly aspirational: he seeks patterns of counsel and mutual recognition among **Baptists** and with other churches that do not impose alien polities but cultivate catholic coherence.

On **apostolicity**, Harmon offers a layered account. The classical marks of the church are specified through the **regula fidei**, missionary obedience, and sacramental participation. He appreciates the ancient **episkopos-presbyter-diakonos** forms and argues that **Baptists** can recognize the **historic episcopate** as a legitimate expression of apostolicity without binding conscience to adopt it. The heart of apostolicity remains continuity in **apostolic teaching**, **mission**, and the enacted **Eucharistic** and **baptismal** life of the people. This posture enables bilateral dialogues to focus less on structural replication and more on faithful reception, with **receptive ecumenism** again providing the hermeneutical key.

#### 5. Sacraments, ordinances, and worship
Though a Baptist, Harmon advocates a careful **sacramental realism**. He resists reducing **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** to bare memorials or merely symbolic ordinances, instead retrieving patristic language of **anamnesis** and **epiclesis** to describe how Christ and the Spirit act through these rites. Harmon accepts the Baptist nomenclature of **ordinance** but urges that ordinances are means by which the risen Christ communicates grace. On **baptism**, he emphasizes **trinitarian** form as the ecumenical hinge and supports mutual recognition of trinitarian baptism between **Baptists** and other communions, even when mode and timing differ. On the **Eucharist**, he presses for a robust real presence without metaphysical over-specification, as a way to honor **Scripture** and the wider **catholic** witness and to nourish a people called to visible unity at one table.

Liturgically, Harmon’s proposals thicken Baptist worship with **creeds**, **lectionaries**, and a revalorized **church year**, all subordinated to **Scripture** and contextual mission. The maxim **lex orandi, lex credendi** is treated as a pastoral engine: by confessing the **creeds**, reading the **canon** comprehensively, and celebrating the **ordinances** with theological gravity, congregations are catechized into the **Trinitarian** gospel and predisposed to ecumenical charity. Harmon links worship renewal to ethical formation, arguing that a **Eucharistic** people learn the habits of reconciliation necessary for **ecumenism**.

#### 6. Interlocutors and ecumenical dialogues
Harmon’s dialogue partners are catholic and evangelical. From **Yves Congar**, he learns renewal through return to sources, ressourcement that reforms the present. From **John Henry Newman**, he adapts **doctrinal development** as a tool for discerning faithful growth under the **regula fidei**. From **George Lindbeck**, he absorbs a **cultural-linguistic** sensibility that stresses community-formed reasoning. From **Jaroslav Pelikan**, he learns to cherish **tradition** while critiquing **traditionalism**. Among Baptists, **James Wm. McClendon Jr.** and **Paul Fiddes** figure as conversation partners on narrative ecclesiology and sacramental theology. At the ecumenical level, Harmon’s engagement with **BEM 1982** and **TCTCV 2013** furnishes shared doctrinal baselines, while bilateral conversations between the **Baptist World Alliance** and Roman Catholic, Orthodox, and Reformed bodies inform his judgments about **baptism**, **Eucharist**, and **ministry**.

A signature thread is Harmon’s advocacy of **receptive ecumenism**, indebted to contemporary proposals that each tradition asks not What can others learn from us, but What can we learn from them to be more faithful to Christ. This frames his consistent call for Baptists to receive the **creeds**, **liturgical** patterns, and sacramental depth of the wider church, while inviting other communions to receive the **Baptist** emphasis on **believers’ baptism**, congregational discernment, and missionary dynamism. The result is not lowest-common-denominator **ecumenism** but differentiated consensus.

#### 7. Baptist identity and the ecumenical future
Harmon argues that **Baptist identity** is not a negation of **catholic ecclesiology** but a charism within it. The **free church** emerges as a gift for the whole church when freedom is construed christologically as freedom-for the truth of **Scripture** and the practices of reconciliation. By narrating **Baptist** history as part of the larger **great tradition**, Harmon resists sectarian instincts and calls for a penitential recognition of how Baptist fragmentation and hurried biblicism can hinder unity. He retrieves **confessions** from 1644 to the **Baptist Faith and Message** not as final words but as witnesses within the **rule of faith**, and he encourages their public use alongside the **Nicene Creed**.

The ecumenical future, in Harmon’s vision, involves modest structural rapprochement and ambitious spiritual deepening. He envisions patterns of shared **catechesis**, intercommunion where warranted by convergences on **Eucharist**, and mutual recognition of **baptism** as the ordinary rule across Christian communities. Structures of **conciliarity**, whether formal or ad hoc, should enable churches to speak together on matters of faith and witness, while allowing legitimate diversity on **adiaphora**. The end is the **visible unity** of the church as a reconciled diversity, not uniformity. This unity is grounded in the **Trinity**, centered on the **gospel**, and enacted in **sacramental** and missional life.

#### 8. Assessment of strengths and limits
Harmon’s greatest strength is a judicious balance: his **Baptist catholicity** avoids antiquarian romanticism, prizes **Scripture**, and treats **tradition** as the Spirit’s pedagogy rather than a juridical competitor. His hermeneutic of the **regula fidei** stabilizes doctrine without stifling **reformata semper reformanda**. His **sacramental** proposals push Baptists beyond reductionism while honoring free-church instincts, and his **conciliar koinonia** reframes autonomy as responsibility. Yet tensions remain. Some Baptists will worry that **visible unity** pressures free-church polity beyond biblical warrant, and that the **creeds** risk eclipsing the believer’s immediate obedience to **Scripture**. The appeal to **doctrinal development** risks ambiguity for communities suspicious of teleological narratives after the **Reformation**. Harmon’s call for liturgical retrieval will face pragmatic resistance where revivalist pieties define authentic worship. Still, the project’s catholic intentionality anchors these debates in a shared pursuit of truth and holiness.

Reformed and Westminster evaluation. At the level of principle, Reformed orthodoxy welcomes Harmon’s retrieval of **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** dogma, the critique of **nuda scriptura**, and the recognition that **Scripture** is read within a Spirit-formed **communion**. Yet caution is warranted on three fronts. First, on authority, the Reformed insist that **Scripture’s self-sufficiency** and clarity for salvation ground a ministerial use of **tradition**; the **regula fidei** must be demonstrably exegetical, not tacitly magisterial, lest the material sufficiency of Scripture be compromised. Second, on the church’s unity, Reformed theology prioritizes **covenantal** and confessional communion as the form of visible unity, wary of **conciliar** models that tend toward institutional consolidation and that dilute discipline and pure worship. The unity pursued is federal and confessional, not necessarily conciliar, lest the doctrine of the spirituality of the church and the primacy of the **Word** be eclipsed. Third, on the sacraments, the Reformed affirm robust **means-of-grace** realism grounded in **Word-and-Spirit**, while rejecting a diffuse **sacramental ontology** that can blur nature and grace; Harmon’s constructive language must be tethered to covenantal promises and the instituted signs to avoid ecumenical inflation. A Reformed alternative would commend a confessional **catholicity** in which **Scripture** norms the **regula fidei**, the **creeds** are ministerial standards, unity is sought through the preached **gospel** and right administration of **sacraments**, and cooperation across communions is ordered by truth, not by structural approximation.
