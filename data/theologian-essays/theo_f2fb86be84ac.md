### ESSAY
Angela W. Gorrell emerges as a practical theologian whose work is inseparable from the late modern pressures of **digital media ecosystems** and the social wounds of **addiction, incarceration, and despair**. Educated and formed within evangelical protestant contexts and teaching at **Baylor University's Truett Seminary**, she also served as a research scholar at the **Yale Center for Faith and Culture** under **Miroslav Volf** during the multi-year **Theology of Joy and the Good Life** initiative. That dual location matters: she thinks with the academy about **human flourishing** and with churches about **discipleship and mission**. Theologically she seeks to hold together **pneumatological joy** and **ecclesial practice**, while methodologically she adopts a recognizably practical theological posture that is descriptive-empirical, interpretive, normative, and pragmatic, echoing trajectories associated with **Richard Osmer** and **Don Browning**. Historically, her corpus stands in a moment when **Marshall McLuhan's media ecology** has become pastoral urgency, when **Sherry Turkle's diagnosis of tethered selves** and **danah boyd's analyses of networked publics** shape the background against which churches must reimagine catechesis. Gorrell's distinctive contribution names **joy** as a theological force of resistance that refuses reduction either to private emotion or to naive optimism, and it does so in the concrete worlds of **screens, prisons, and grief**.

Her method is interdisciplinary and unapologetically ecclesial, mobilizing **scriptural exegesis**, **qualitative research**, and **practices of the church** as mutually illuminating sources. Gorrell starts with lived experience and proceeds through thick description toward normative claims about **God, grace, and the good life**. Yet the theological center is classically Christian: **joy is a gift of the Triune God**, rooted in **Christological redemption** and mediated by the **Holy Spirit** within the **people of God**. In this way, she joins the modern conversation on **flourishing** without collapsing Christian joy into secular wellbeing. The controlling intuition is Augustinian: human beings are creatures of desire whose **ordo amoris** is formed by liturgies and technologies; spiritual health requires rightly ordered loves oriented to **God and neighbor**. Where secular media theory locates the self as a nodal consumer within algorithmic networks, Gorrell reframes the self as a **baptized agent** whose identity is received in **ecclesial belonging** and whose agency is trained through **habitus-forming practices** of prayer, confession, and service. Her epistemic stance honors testimony, especially the testimony of those who suffer, insisting that the truth of **joy and lament** must be held in tension within the Body of Christ.

Gorrell's **Always On: Practicing Faith in a New Media Landscape** (2019) is a paradigmatic statement of her approach to **digital culture**. The book refuses both panic and embrace, critiquing **technological determinism** while taking seriously **McLuhan's insight that media are environments** that pattern attention, desire, and community. She draws on **Sherry Turkle's Alone Together** and **danah boyd's It's Complicated** to show that attention economies elicit curated selves and anxious vigilance, then asks the theological question: What kind of persons is the Spirit forming within these liturgies of distraction. The answer comes by way of **Christian practices**. Gorrell recommends **Sabbath-keeping** to resist 24/7 connectivity, **embodied presence** to counter disembodied performativity, **truthful speech and confession** to unmask digital self-fashioning, **hospitality** as neighbor-love in online spaces, and **wisdom** in news consumption and outrage cycles. The church, she argues, can become a school for **attentive love** by training disciples in rhythms that normalize silence, face-to-face reconciliation, and limits, thereby repenting of digital habits that form us for **envy, envy-fueled comparison, and tribal antagonism**.

The theological payoff of **Always On** is not primarily a moralism of technique but an anthropology and ecclesiology: human beings are creatures addressed by God, and the **ecclesia** is a community whose sacrificial attention witnesses to **divine kenosis**. Where platforms reward constant reaction, Christians are called to **patience and hope**, eschatological dispositions that resist the tyranny of the feed. Gorrell accents **embodiment** because the gospel announces the **Word made flesh**, and thus the body cannot be reduced to a profile or a projection. She mines **Augustine's Confessions** for an account of restless desire and sees in **Paul's admonitions** a counter-formation toward restraining speech, bearing burdens, and rejoicing with those who rejoice. In effect, the book functions as a catechesis in **virtues and vices** for the networked age, where **discernment** takes center stage: to what narratives and to whose approval are we entrusting ourselves. The result is a pastoral theology that meets the problems named by **Turkle** and **boyd**, but refracts them through the distinctive light of **Christological discipleship** and **pneumatological sanctification**.

If **Always On** diagnoses how attention and belonging are catechized in the digital liturgy, **The Gravity of Joy: A Story of Being Lost and Found** (2021) discloses the spiritual weight of joy under the pressure of **suffering and trauma**. Written amid searing personal losses through **suicide and overdose** while Gorrell was researching joy at Yale, the book is at once memoir and theological reflection. It is marked by her work with incarcerated women, where a **Joy** study group in a maximum-security prison surfaced stories of pain, solidarity, and grace. Against thin conceptions of happiness as positivity, Gorrell contends that **joy has gravity**: it is not buoyant denial but a profound anchoring in God that pulls persons toward **truth-telling, lament, and justice-seeking**. Joy is resilient presence, a stubborn gladness that refuses the ultimacy of death-dealing powers. She turns to **Scripture's witness**, especially **the Magnificat**, **the Beatitudes**, and **Philippians**, to argue that Christian joy arises not from conditions but from **communion with God and neighbor**, often intensified in sites of suffering. This is joy as **eschatological foretaste** and **moral protest**, the opposite of resignation.

In framing **joy as resistance**, Gorrell stands near **Jürgen Moltmann's theology of hope** and resonates with streams of **Black ecclesial tradition** that sing joy in the midst of oppression. She also appropriates **Miroslav Volf's account of flourishing** without letting it mutate into mere wellness rhetoric. Joy, for Gorrell, is a **pneumatological gift** that can be practiced, not manufactured: it is cultivated by **gratitude**, **confession**, **storytelling**, **singing**, and **shared meals**, and it is safeguarded by **truthfulness about grief**. She insists that lament is the elder sibling of praise; without lament, joy degrades into sentimentality; without joy, lament curdles into cynicism. Theologically, this aligns with a paschal pattern: cruciform life that participates in **Christ's death and resurrection**. Practically, she summons churches to create spaces where those ravaged by **addiction, incarceration, and isolation** can experience belonging and purpose, resisting a culture of disposable persons. Joy thereby becomes missional, turning communities outward in practices of **mercy and justice** that taste and enact the coming kingdom.

Gorrell's constructive argument builds out moral and ecclesial implications. For pastors and congregations, joy requires **liturgical practices** that hold sorrow and hope together, as well as **pastoral care** that names the particularities of trauma and addiction. Preaching should rehearse the **grand narrative of redemption** while making room for congregational testimony that witnesses to **God's faithfulness** in the valleys. Youth and college ministries need to teach **digital discernment** and **embodied friendship**, equipping young adults to inhabit platforms with integrity and to locate their primary identity in **baptismal vocation** rather than in metrics. Publicly, churches should develop ministries of presence in prisons and recovery programs, becoming laboratories where **joy's gravity** draws people into **reconciliation and healing**. Her vision is not programmatic triumphalism; it is a patient commitment to simple practices that sustain a counterculture of grace.

Doctrinally, Gorrell trades in the classical grammar of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**, accenting the **pneumatological reality** of **joy as fruit of the Spirit** and the **ecclesial vocation** to mirror **Christ's kenotic love**. Her anthropology is hopeful without being naive: sin is both disordered love and structural captivity, a diagnosis that accommodates **addiction** and **social injustice** while still calling for **sanctification**. Her ecclesiology is thickly communal and functionally sacramental in its emphasis on embodied practices, even where sacramental theology as such remains understated. Eschatology is already-not-yet: **joy anticipates the banquet** yet learns the language of tears. Soteriology appears narratively, as participation in **Christ's life** more than as a forensic scheme, though she does not deny the latter. The result is a spirituality that is resilient, communal, and public, at home in **Pauline joy** and **Lucan jubilee** alike.

As a conversationalist, Gorrell sits within a network of contemporary voices. She receives **Charles Taylor's account of the secular age** as ambient background for her attention to cross-pressures and fragilization of belief. She interacts with **media ecology** via **McLuhan** and **Neil Postman**, though with pastoral attention to ordinary discipleship rather than sweeping civilizational critique. She echoes **Dorothy Bass's practices** emphasis and sometimes the liturgical anthropology advanced by **James K. A. Smith**, while refusing any ecclesial romanticism that would ignore trauma. She challenges ecclesial leaders to think beyond programmatic metrics by recovering **habitus** and **virtue ethics** under the sign of **joy**. In debates about the word flourishing, she keeps a theological tether by narrating **joy** from **Scripture** and embedding it in communities of **truth and reconciliation**.

The upshot of Gorrell's work is a public practical theology in which **joy** names a mode of faithful existence that is both gift and task amid **digital mediation** and **social suffering**. Her distinctive contribution is to integrate **media-savvy discipleship** with **lament-inflected joy**, closing the gap between the church's online life and on-the-ground ministries among those who grieve. By centering **the Spirit**, **practices**, and **community**, she offers a way to resist the forces that commodify attention and trivialize pain. In tone her work is pastoral; in scope it is missional; in substance it is recognizably evangelical with ecumenical generosity. Theologically it is an invitation: attend to **God's presence**, honor **tears**, practice **gladness**, and make room for **others**.

From a Reformed and WTS vantage, Gorrell's emphasis on **joy as fruit of the Spirit**, **Scripture-shaped practices**, and **ecclesial community** meets deep resonance. Yet two tensions invite sharpening. First, the normative balance between **experience and revelation** sometimes leans toward narrative authority, and a thicker dogmatic anchorage in **union with Christ**, **justification and adoption**, and the **means of grace** would locate joy more explicitly in the objective benefits of **Christ's mediatorial work**. Joy is irreducibly affective and communal, but it is first a juridical and filial reality flowing from **covenantal inclusion** and **Word-and-Sacrament ministry**. Second, in digital ethics her call to practices could be complemented by a more explicit doctrine of **Sabbath and the Lord's Day**, rooted in **creation ordinance** and **covenant**, as well as by attention to **natural law** limits on technological manipulation. The Reformed alternative is not to mute her pastoral insights but to ground them in the **Westminster Standards' account** of assurance, sanctification as **mortification and vivification**, and the church as the sphere where the **Spirit** ordinarily works through **preaching, sacraments, and prayer**, thereby deepening the ontological and covenantal foundations of the very **joy** that Gorrell so winsomely commends.
