### ESSAY
Wesley Hill’s work stands at the intersection of contemporary evangelical debates on **sexual ethics** and the renewed attention to **pro-Nicene Trinitarian theology** in biblical studies. Formed in the orbit of **Wheaton College**, doctoral training at **Durham University**, and ordained ministry in the **Anglican Church in North America**, Hill writes as a scholar-priest who binds **Scripture**, **dogma**, and **pastoral cure**. His enduring thesis is that the church must retrieve **spiritual friendship** and a robust theology of **baptismal belonging** while reading **Paul** within a **Trinitarian** horizon marked by **persons and relations**. From his early **Washed and Waiting** 2010 to **Spiritual Friendship** 2015 and **Paul and the Trinity** 2015, he advances a vision that weds **ascetical discipleship** to **pro-Nicene ressourcement**, resisting both **revisionist sexual ethics** and reductionist accounts of **Pauline monotheism**.

Hill’s intellectual formation owes much to **Richard Hays’ moral vision of the New Testament**, the sacramental-holistic imagination of **Rowan Williams**, and the ethical-political clarity of **Oliver O’Donovan** on **creation, resurrection, and moral order**. In the guild of Pauline studies he converses with **Gordon Fee** on **pneumatology**, **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham** on **divine identity**, and the **apocalyptic** perspectives of **J. Louis Martyn** and allied voices. Yet he declines to imitate **historicist** or **sociological** reductions, choosing instead a **canonical-dogmatic** posture that treats the **regula fidei** as a hermeneutical guide. Situated within post-2000 debates on **early high Christology** and within ecclesial conflicts culminating in gatherings like **Revoice 2018**, Hill writes not as an activist but as an ascetical theologian who believes that **catechesis**, **Eucharistic belonging**, and *ascesis* can render chastity intelligible and livable.

Methodologically Hill exemplifies what many call **theological interpretation of Scripture**: the **canon** is read in the church, under the **creed**, and toward **sanctification**. He invokes **pro-Nicene** grammar as a clarifying lens rather than an extraneous overlay, arguing for a hermeneutical *circulus fidei*, a spiral in which **Scripture** yields the church’s **confession** and the **confession** trains the church to hear Scripture truly. Doctrinally the terms **persons and relations** function as conceptual tools for grasping **Paul’s triadic patterns** without collapsing **Christ** and the **Spirit** into mere functions of the **Father**. Ethically he centers **vocation**, **baptismal identity**, and **church as family**, contending that **celibacy** is not a negation but a positive **charism**. Theologically he locates **sanctification** within **participation in Christ**, adopting a strongly **Augustinian** account of grace while also stressing the ecclesial shape of **habituation** and **friendship** under *ordo caritatis*, the order of charity.

In **Washed and Waiting** 2010 Hill came to prominence by narrating his own experience as a **celibate gay Christian** who embraces the church’s historic commitment to **marriage between a man and a woman** and to **chastity** outside marriage. The book weaves memoir with exegesis, moving through **Romans 8**, **1 Corinthians 6**, and the **Psalms of lament**, in order to commend **patience**, **hope**, and **faithfulness** as sanctifying virtues. Against therapeutic or **ex-gay** paradigms, he does not promise **orientation change** but summons the baptized to **mortification and vivification**, daily dying and rising with **Christ**. The governing soteriology is **eschatological**. The believer groans for **adoption, the redemption of the body**, as the **Spirit** bears witness and strengthens weak prayer. Hill’s pastoral counsel centers concrete practices, **confession of sin**, **spiritual direction**, and inclusion within **household** networks of care. The result is a sober, rich alternative to both **liberal revisionism** and despairing **moralism**.

Where **Washed and Waiting** frames the problem of desire and hope, **Spiritual Friendship** 2015 offers a constructive ecclesial response. Hill retrieves **Aelred of Rievaulx’s Spiritual Friendship** and **Augustine’s Confessions** on friendship’s sanctifying potential, arguing that **friendship** is a divinely appointed sphere for **charity**, **fidelity**, and **mutual obligation**. In a culture that sacralizes **romance** and privatizes **kinship**, Hill proposes the church recover **publicly acknowledged friendships** that can bear weight akin to family bonds. He explores ancient practices that linked households through vows and shared rule, cautiously engaging debates about **adelphopoiesis** while refusing any conflation of friendship with **erotic partnership**. For Hill, **vowed friendship** or covenantal companionship offers a path for **celibate gay Christians** and for unmarried believers more broadly to live **stability**, **hospitality**, and **fruitfulness**. The project sparked vigorous debate across evangelical and Reformed communities, particularly in the aftermath of **Revoice 2018**, where Hill and allied voices contended that robust **orthodox sexual ethics** must be matched by robust **ecclesial belonging**.

Hill roots his friendship proposal exegetically and sacramentally. Biblically he highlights **David and Jonathan**, the **household** language of the **Pastoral Epistles**, the **one-another** imperatives of **Romans 12** and **Galatians 6**, and **Jesus’ declaration** that friends are those who do his will, a community of **agape** and shared mission. Ecclesiologically he insists that **baptism** incorporates believers into a new **kinship** where the **Eucharist** binds as a covenantal meal. Friendship becomes a site of *ascesis*, a school for learning **patience**, **truth-telling**, and **mutual submission**. Drawing on **Oliver O’Donovan’s** account of the **orders of creation and redemption**, Hill argues that friendship does not rival **marriage** but complements it, enabling the church to embody **chastity** without loneliness and **fruitfulness** without procreation. In this way the rhetoric of **chosen family** is transfigured by the **communion of saints**, a graced body ordered by *ordo caritatis* toward **God**.

If Hill’s ethical work presses toward ecclesial repair, **Paul and the Trinity** 2015 supplies the dogmatic backbone. Responding to modern anxieties that **Nicene categories** are a Hellenizing overlay on **Paul**, he argues that **Paul’s letters** already deploy relational and personal patterns consonant with **pro-Nicene** faith. Engaging **Gordon Fee** on the **Spirit**, **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham** on **early devotion to Jesus**, and **N. T. Wright** on **narrative monotheism**, Hill contends that the Pauline witness features differentiated yet inseparable operations of **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**. Close readings of **1 Corinthians 8.6**, **2 Corinthians 13.13**, **Galatians 4**, **Romans 8**, and **Philippians 2** reveal that the **Spirit** is not a mere power but a **personal agent** who unites believers to **Christ**, and that **Christ** is confessed and worshiped within the identity of the one **God of Israel**. The church, Hill avers, is licensed to speak of **persons** and **relations**, of **missions** that reflect **processions**, because Paul’s own language strains toward that grammar.

The interpretive wager of **Paul and the Trinity** is a disciplined **ressourcement**. Hill refuses a flat historicism and opts for a regulated **retrospective reading**, where **Nicene** and **pro-Nicene** developments offer a second-order idiom that actually clarifies the **apostolic** pattern. He is not naïve about anachronism, but proposes that doctrinal development, rightly understood, is a growth in **confessional precision** that preserves the **rule of faith** that Paul already confesses. Here Hill engages **Lewis Ayres** and **Khaled Anatolios** on **pro-Nicene theology**, contending that the **inseparable operations** of the three together govern all divine action, while the **personal properties** maintain real distinction. The payoff is not only historical but pastoral, for the believer’s **participation in Christ** through the **Spirit** is nothing other than inclusion in the **Son’s** filial relation to the **Father**.

A smaller but telling contribution is **The Lord’s Prayer: A Guide to Praying to Our Father** 2019, where Hill applies his trinitarian-exegetical instincts to catechesis. Prayer to the **Father**, in **the Son**, by the **Spirit**, becomes the grammar of Christian confidence and sanctification. The petition for daily bread trains **dependence**, forgiveness trains **reconciliation**, and deliverance from evil trains **vigilance**, all cultivated within the practices of **friendship** and **churchly discipline**. This catechetical emphasis binds Hill’s projects: **spiritual friendship** without **prayer** atrophies into lifestyle management, and **Trinitarian theology** without **ascesis** becomes scholastic abstraction. The unifying thread is a practical **participation in Christ**, enacted in common life, ordered by **charity**, and sustained by the **Spirit** in weakness.

Reception of Hill’s work has been characteristically polarized and fruitful. From revisionist quarters his insistence on **chastity** and the **male-female norm of marriage** is rejected as needlessly austere, while his proposal for **vowed friendship** is dismissed as a failed compromise. From conservative evangelical and Reformed quarters, many welcome his courageous witness and his robust **Pauline Trinitarianism**, while probing his use of **gay Christian** as a descriptor and scrutinizing the ecclesial wisdom of **publicly recognized friendships**. The **Revoice 2018** controversy crystallized these tensions, as Hill and others sought to create space for **Side B** testimonies under **orthodox confession**. In scholarly venues, **Paul and the Trinity** drew commendation for exegetical sensitivity and theological clarity, even as some specialists queried the transferability of **pro-Nicene** idioms to **first-century** texts. Throughout, Hill’s seriousness about **Scripture**, **sacrament**, and **sanctification** marks him as a pastor-theologian rather than a polemicist.

A final evaluation from a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage sees much to affirm and a few principled cautions. Positively, Hill’s **pro-Nicene** reading of **Paul** coheres with **Reformed orthodoxy** on **inseparable operations**, **personal distinctions**, and the **Spirit’s agency**, and his moral stance on **marriage** and **chastity** accords with the **Westminster Standards**. His ecclesial emphasis on **means of grace**, **catechesis**, and **communion of saints** resonates with a covenantal account of sanctification. The critique turns on anthropology and ecclesial prudence. First, regarding **concupiscence**, the Reformed tradition stresses that disordered inclination toward same-sex desire is itself **sin** in the sense of corruption, even when not consented, and should be named as such within **mortification** under **union with Christ**, which suggests caution about stabilizing any adjectival **identity** drawn from fallenness. Second, about **vowed friendship**, while the communion of saints obligates believers to mutual love, elevating private friendships to quasi-ecclesial covenants risks obscuring the primacy of instituted bonds under **Word and sacrament**, namely **marriage**, **household**, and **local church membership** under **elders**. A Reformed alternative would commend thick, accountable **household hospitality**, intentional **diaconal networks**, and pastoral care ordered by the **keys of the kingdom**, without creating new vow structures. Within these clarifications, Hill’s summons to a chaste, prayerful **participation in Christ** and his **Trinitarian** exegetical ressourcement remain genuine gifts for evangelical theology and pastoral practice.
