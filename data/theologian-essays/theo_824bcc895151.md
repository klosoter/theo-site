### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and pastoral location
Michael Lawrence emerges within the ecosystem of **contemporary evangelicalism** in the United States, where the renewal of **expository preaching**, **church discipline**, and **pastoral ecclesiology** advanced by **9Marks** and **Capitol Hill Baptist Church** set the tone for his program. Trained in historical and systematic studies and completing advanced work in theology in Cambridge, Lawrence’s professional identity is that of pastor-theologian rather than academic specialist, a profile that aligns with the **neo-Reformed** retrieval of **confessional piety** and **dogmatic clarity** in the wake of late twentieth-century evangelical fragmentation. His ministry at **Capitol Hill Baptist** and later at **Hinson Baptist Church** unfolded against the backdrop of a transatlantic conversation on **biblical theology**, from **Geerhardus Vos** to **Edmund Clowney** and **Graeme Goldsworthy**, and a renewed evangelical confidence in **penal substitutionary atonement**. These currents framed his theological instincts: rooting doctrine in the **canonical storyline**, keeping the **local church** central, and reading the economy of redemption through the lens of **covenant** and **kingdom**.

Lawrence’s historical moment was marked by a dual reaction. On one side, evangelical churches wrestled with **revivalist decisionism**, pragmatic method, and thin **church membership**. On the other, academic theology pressed new accounts of **justification** and **atonement**, especially within the **New Perspective on Paul** and narrative-historical approaches. Lawrence responds by insisting that pastors do **biblical theology** as a discipline and that congregations inhabit the canon’s **creation-fall-redemption-new creation** architecture. The result is a pastoral method that treats **Scripture’s unity** as the horizon for **preaching**, **catechesis**, and **discipleship**, and that views ecclesial practice as the ordained form of gospel display.

#### 2. Method: biblical theology in service of the local church
The hallmark of Lawrence’s method is a canonical or **redemptive-historical hermeneutic** anchored in **Sola Scriptura** and ordered to the **local church**. He distinguishes **biblical theology** from **systematic theology**, not to divide them but to clarify their distinct tasks. Biblical theology traces the progressive, historical unfolding of **promise and fulfillment**, **covenant**, **kingdom**, **temple**, and **sonship** as they culminate in **Jesus Christ**, while systematic theology organizes doctrinal loci with an **analogia fidei** coherence. Lawrence’s signature claim is that pastors must do both. The sermon, the counseling session, the elders’ meeting, and the evangelistic conversation all rest on the ability to locate any text within the **whole-Bible storyline** and to confess the church’s **dogmatic grammar**.

Key to this method are two tools. First, **typology**, which Lawrence deploys in line with **Clowney** and **Goldsworthy**, reading persons, offices, and institutions as divinely intended shadows that find telos in **Christ** without collapsing historical particularity. Second, **covenant**, which orders redemptive epochs and guards the continuity of **Old and New Testaments** while allowing for newness in the **new covenant**. The pastoral fruit of this approach is a Christ-centered, non-allegorical reading that resists moralistic atomism and equips churches to inhabit **creation-fall-redemption-new creation** as their interpretive home.

#### 3. Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church 2010: thesis, architecture, and pedagogy
In **Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church** 2010, Lawrence offers a manual for pastors who want to preach and shepherd with an explicitly **canonical** consciousness. The book argues that biblical theology is not an academic luxury but a pastoral necessity that disciplines **exegesis**, trains **congregational imagination**, and guards the **gospel**. The architecture of the work follows the **storyline** itself, introducing **creation**, **fall**, **promise**, **exodus**, **kingdom**, **exile**, **return**, and **new covenant** themes, and shows how **fulfillment in Christ** reframes each theme for **preaching** and **discipleship**. Pastors are given practical strategies for tracing **typological patterns**, for linking prophetic **promise** to apostolic **kerygma**, and for distinguishing legitimate **application** from moralistic distortion.

The book’s pastoral pedagogy is on display in its chapters that walk from text to pulpit. Lawrence recommends that pastors first establish a text’s place in the **covenantal** structure, attend to the development of **kingdom and temple** motifs, and then articulate **gospel connections** that are organically warranted by the text’s place within **redemption history**. The aim is not a homiletical formula but a biblical habitus in which the **person and work of Christ**, climaxing in **penal substitutionary atonement** and **resurrection**, anchor the exposition. Behind the scenes stand the methodological commitments of **Vos** and **Clowney**, translated into congregational idiom and evangelical practice.

#### 4. Preaching Christ and protecting the gospel: texts, themes, and doctrine
Lawrence’s emphasis on **preaching Christ from all Scripture** reflects a conviction that the text’s own **progressive revelation** must norm proclamation. In this, he follows **Graeme Goldsworthy’s** insight that the **kingdom of God** is God’s people in God’s place under God’s rule, a pattern that illumines **Genesis to Revelation** and culminates in the **new creation**. But he equally insists that this Christocentric reading secures and not erases key doctrines like **divine holiness**, **human sin**, **justification by faith**, and **atonement**. The law-gospel dynamic is read through **covenant** rather than abstracted categories, so that the gravity of the **fall**, the demand for **righteousness**, and the relief of **imputation** and **adoption** are staged within the one story.

By training pastors to track **typology**, Lawrence also inoculates churches against faddish readings shaped by cultural moment rather than canonical logic. He warns that a church without **biblical theology** will drift either into moralism or into a doctrinal minimalism that cannot sustain **discipline** or **mission**. The sermon becomes the center of congregational catechesis not because the pulpit is a stage for the preacher but because it is the place where the **rule of faith** is displayed from the Scriptures, renews the people in the **new covenant**, and aligns the saints with the **mission of God**.

#### 5. Conversion 2017: regeneracy, faith and repentance, and the making of a people
In **Conversion: How God Creates a People** 2017, Lawrence turns to the doctrine of **conversion**, targeting the malformations of **revivalist decisionism** and casual **nominalism**. The thesis is that biblical conversion is a sovereign act of **God’s regenerating grace** that issues in **repentance and faith**, unites believers to **Christ**, and necessarily incorporates them into a visible, accountable **local church**. The book retrieves the older evangelical grammar of **new birth**, **repentance**, and **discipleship**, underwrites **regenerate church membership**, and grounds **church discipline** and the **ordinances** as public, covenantal signs of the **gospel**.

Here the interplay between **biblical theology** and **systematic soteriology** is explicit. Lawrence reads conversion against the background of **covenant promise**, the **outpouring of the Spirit** in the **new covenant**, and the **ingathering of the nations** promised to **Abraham**. He argues that individualistic accounts truncate the teleology of conversion, which is not merely escape from judgment but incorporation into the **people of God** destined for **new creation**. He presses pastoral practice toward clear use of **church membership**, meaningful **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper**, and toward a catechesis that articulates the costliness of **discipleship** and the assurance grounded in **union with Christ**.

#### 6. It Is Well 2010 and the retrieval of penal substitutionary atonement
With **Mark Dever**, Lawrence contributed to the retrieval project represented by **It Is Well: Expositions on Substitutionary Atonement** 2010. The volume gathers pastoral expositions that explicate **penal substitution** as the heart of the **gospel**, integrating **sacrifice**, **wrath**, **propitiation**, and **reconciliation** across Old and New Testaments. Lawrence’s approach is to let **biblical theology** furnish the grammar for atonement, showing how the **sacrificial system**, the **Suffering Servant**, and the **Passover** coalesce in the cross of **Christ**. The aim is not polemics for their own sake, but catechesis: safeguarding the church’s confession, clarifying evangelistic appeal, and structuring the **Lord’s Supper** and **preaching** around the finished work of **Christ**.

The theological stakes are explicit. Without **penal substitution**, the canonical logic of **holiness**, **justice**, and **mercy** dissolves into vagueness, and pastoral practice will drift into therapeutic generalities. With it, the church can proclaim a definite atonement accomplished in history, mediated by a true **High Priest**, and applied by the **Spirit**. Lawrence’s expositions aim to show how the canonical patterns of **covenant curses** and **blessing** are resolved by the **new covenant in Christ’s blood**, thereby securing assurance and energizing **mission**.

#### 7. Ecclesiology and the 9Marks frame: membership, discipline, and mission
The threads of Lawrence’s work are woven into the broader ecclesial vision of **9Marks**: **expository preaching**, **biblical theology**, **the gospel**, **conversion**, **evangelism**, **membership**, **discipline**, **discipleship**, **leadership**, and **church governance**. His particular burden lies with the way **biblical theology** animates and guards all nine marks. A congregation that hears **creation-fall-redemption-new creation** each Lord’s Day will grasp the meaning of **membership**, consent to the necessity of **discipline**, and embrace **mission** as the outflow of the **kingdom** rather than a marketing strategy. In this frame, **regenerate church membership** is not sectarian rigor but covenantal realism, the fitting correlate of **new covenant** promises written on the heart.

Lawrence’s **Baptist** convictions appear in the application of **covenant** to the **ordinances**. **Believers’ baptism** signifies union with **Christ** and entry into a visible **people**, while the **Lord’s Supper** renews the covenant bond and displays **atonement** and **unity**. His ecclesiology is intentionally ordinary, built around weekly **preaching**, congregational **prayer**, and elder-led **discipline**. He wants doctrine to be practiced, and he wants practice to be doctrinal, so that the church’s public life is itself an embodied **biblical theology** that narrates **promise and fulfillment** and anticipates **new creation**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: continuity, justification, and biblical-theological habits
Lawrence’s intellectual debts include **Geerhardus Vos** for the idea of **biblical theology** as a distinct discipline, **Edmund Clowney** for Christocentric **preaching**, and **Graeme Goldsworthy** for the shaping theme of **kingdom**. He shares with **D. A. Carson** a suspicion of exegetical minimalism that neglects the **canon’s unity**. As interlocutors, he engages in-house evangelical debates over **justification** and the **New Perspective on Paul** by re-centering **penal substitution** and **imputation** in the storyline rather than by syllogistic defense alone. He also confronts the pastoral effects of **decisionism**, arguing that a **regenerate church** is the intended fruit of **new covenant** grace, which then grounds meaningful **membership** and **discipline**.

A distinctive contribution is methodological. Lawrence trains pastors to ask canonical rather than purely pragmatic questions. Where is this text in **covenant history**. How does its **typology** point to **Christ**. How does the **kingdom** advance here toward **new creation**. How do these movements cash out in **preaching**, **evangelism**, and **discipleship**. By normalizing these questions, he supplies a habit of mind that guards against trend-driven ministry while keeping **doctrinal development** tethered to **Scripture’s** own modes of discourse. His work thus belongs to the school of redemptive-historical evangelicalism that recovers both biblical literacy and doctrinal conviction at the congregational level.

#### 9. Doctrinal center and limits: theological depth and pastoral scope
At the center of Lawrence’s theology stand **Christ crucified**, **penal substitution**, and the **new covenant** as the charter of a **regenerate people**. He is strongest where the **biblical-theological** categories give pastoral leverage: linking **exodus** to **atonement**, **kingdom** to **church**, and **promise** to **fulfillment**. He is comfortable with classic **Reformed soteriology**, stressing **union with Christ**, **repentance and faith**, and the **sovereignty of grace**, and he renders these not as abstract loci but as the backbone of congregational life. His stresses naturally produce corresponding omissions. Lawrence gives less sustained attention to metaphysical dogmatics such as **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**, not because he denies them but because his project is ecclesial instruction rather than scholastic retrieval. Likewise, his **Baptist** covenantal reading yields conclusions about **baptism** and **church membership** that differ from **paedobaptist** Reformed accounts, especially concerning the relation of **covenant sign** and **covenant community** across the testaments.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation. From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage point, Lawrence’s achievement is significant. He models a **Vosian** redemptive-historical method and a **Clowneyan** Christocentric preaching practice that align with confessional **Sola Scriptura** and strengthen **penal substitution** at the center of the **gospel**. The pastoral integration of **biblical theology** with **church order** coheres with classical **covenant theology** at the level of storyline and with **Westminster** commitments to the ordinary means of grace. Tensions arise at three points. First, his **Baptist** deployment of **new covenant** realities to require **regenerate membership** may be judged by paedobaptist Reformed theology to overstate discontinuity in the administration of the **covenant of grace**, thereby narrowing the **visible church** and attenuating the typological bond between **Abrahamic** promise and **household** inclusion. Second, the relative underdevelopment of classical **theologia** and first-order **attributes** can leave the metaphysical depth of doctrines like **divine simplicity** and **immutability** assumed rather than taught, which a Reformed scholastic would wish to address for doctrinal stability. Third, while Lawrence carefully distinguishes **biblical** and **systematic theology**, a Reformed dogmaticist may press for a more robust **analogia fidei** and **rule of faith**, so that canonical readings are explicitly normed by creedal consensus and the confessional system. None of these tensions negate the value of Lawrence’s contribution. Within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, the alternative is not to abandon his program but to supplement it: receive his **redemptive-historical** and **pastoral** strengths, integrate a fuller two-covenant schema of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, expand instruction in **classical theism**, and articulate **sacramental** theology with richer **means-of-grace** categories. In that integrated form, Lawrence’s work becomes an exemplary bridge between **exegesis**, **dogmatics**, and the lived life of the **church**.
