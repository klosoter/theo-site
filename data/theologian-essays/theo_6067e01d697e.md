### TITLE
Heaven opened now and not yet: Andrew T. Lincoln’s historical-critical exegesis of Paul and John in service of theology

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Late twentieth- and early twenty-first-century British **historical-critical** setting, shaped by post-Bultmannian exegesis, narrative criticism, and canonical debate in the Anglophone academy.
- Method: rigorous **redaction and narrative criticism** oriented to the canon’s theological claims, with cautious appropriation of **theological interpretation** and an epistemic humility about **pseudonymity** and tradition.
- Key works: **Paradise Now and Not Yet** (1981); **Ephesians, Word Biblical Commentary** (1990); **The Theology of the Later Pauline Letters** with A. J. M. Wedderburn (1993); **Truth on Trial: The Lawsuit Motif in the Fourth Gospel** (2000); **The Gospel According to St John, BNTC** (2005); **Born of a Virgin?** (2013).
- Central categories: **realized eschatology**, **heavenly realm**, **Deutero-Pauline** development, Johannine **lawsuit and witness**, **canonical reception** of creeds, Sabbath as **fulfilled rest** rather than binding statute.
- Interlocutors: **Rudolf Bultmann**, **Raymond E. Brown**, **Ernst Käsemann**, **Oscar Cullmann**, **Richard Bauckham**, **Peter T. O’Brien**, **D. A. Carson**.
- Reformed cue: debates over **Scripture’s authority and authorship**, **virginal conception** as dogmatic locus, and **Sabbath** within the abiding moral law invite a classical Reformed evaluation.

### ESSAY
Andrew T. Lincoln emerges within the late twentieth-century British world of **historical-critical New Testament studies**, a milieu indebted to **Rudolf Bultmann’s** demythologizing impulse yet tempered by the post-war turn to **redaction, narrative, and social-historical criticism**. Trained in the United Kingdom and teaching on both sides of the Atlantic, including Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and later the University of Gloucestershire, Lincoln represents a careful scholar who refuses both naive harmonization and easy iconoclasm. His work moves between **Pauline eschatology** and **Johannine theology**, always with an eye to the **canon’s theological freight**. He exemplifies a generation for whom issues of **pseudonymity**, **community formation**, and **tradition history** are not threats to faith but coordinates for disciplined exegesis. Yet, unlike some heirs of **Bultmann**, Lincoln welcomes the church’s **creedal reception** as a living interlocutor, even when he disputes specific dogmatic entailments. The result is a method marked by critical rigor, a chastened aspiration to **theological interpretation**, and sustained attention to how texts function within **ecclesial confession**.

The first decisive statement of Lincoln’s agenda is **Paradise Now and Not Yet** (1981), a study that probes the **heavenly dimension** of Pauline thought with special reference to **eschatology**. Against a simplistic polarity between futurist expectation and present possession, Lincoln argues for a nuanced **realized eschatology** already operative in Paul. He analyzes texts such as **2 Corinthians 12** and **Philippians 3** and reads the language of being seated with Christ in the **heavenly places** as a participation now in realities still awaiting consummation. Influenced by **Oscar Cullmann’s** inaugurated eschatology and critically engaging **Ernst Käsemann’s** apocalyptic emphasis, Lincoln maps how Paul’s experience and proclamation render heaven not a remote postmortem locale but an operative sphere of divine sovereignty. The book’s payoff is methodological as much as doctrinal: a template for reading New Testament texts through the dialectic of **already and not yet**, without evacuating apocalyptic futurity or dissolving salvation into interior experience.

That template gives structure to Lincoln’s major contribution on **Ephesians** in the **Word Biblical Commentary** (1990), where he argues that the letter is **pseudonymous** yet theologically fecund within a **Pauline school**. The commentary’s backbone is the vision of **anakephalaiosis**, the summing up of all things in Christ, a cosmic **recapitulation** that grounds the church’s identity as a **new humanity**. Lincoln reads the blessing of **Ephesians 1** as doxological theology, the union-by-election of Jew and Gentile as a realized gift, and the **household code** as a reconfiguration of social relations under Christ’s lordship rather than a timeless blueprint. He situates Ephesians in relation to **Colossians**, tracing literary dependence and theological development, and he contends that the letter’s style and ecclesial institutionalization signal post-Pauline authorship. The commentary models a disciplinary balance: robust **Greek philology**, traction with **Second Temple Jewish** and Greco-Roman backgrounds, and a consistently theological interpretation of the text’s cosmology and **ecclesiology**.

The collaborative **The Theology of the Later Pauline Letters** with **A. J. M. Wedderburn** (1993) extends these judgments into a constructive profile of **Deutero-Pauline** theology. Here Ephesians, **Colossians**, and the **Pastoral Epistles** display trajectories of doctrinal consolidation and ecclesial ordering, including the maturation of **Christology**, the framing of **ministry**, and the handling of **false teaching**. Lincoln and Wedderburn do not reduce theology to sociology, but they insist that doctrinal crystallization emerges within identifiable post-apostolic conflicts and needs. The result is a depiction of Pauline tradition as dynamic rather than static, a school whose framings of **justification**, **reconciliation**, and **sanctification** develop in new idioms when confronting new cultural configurations. For Lincoln, this is neither betrayal nor progressivism; it is canonically visible **reception** that the interpreter must trace with historical realism and theological patience.

Lincoln’s turn to **Johannine studies** produces two works that remain programmatic. In **Truth on Trial: The Lawsuit Motif in the Fourth Gospel** (2000), he argues that John is structured by a pervasive **forensic pattern** in which the identity of Jesus is adjudicated in a cosmic **lawsuit**. The Gospel’s deployment of **witness** language, the marshaling of **signs**, and the roles of the **Father**, **Scriptures**, and **Paraclete** all contribute to an extended trial concerning **truth**. This motif integrates narrative episodes, clarifies the rhetorical function of opponents, and links the disciples’ testimony with the mission of the Spirit. Lincoln’s **Black’s New Testament Commentary** on **John** (2005) generalizes this insight into a full-scale reading. He locates the Gospel within a stream of **Johannine tradition**, cautious about equating the **Beloved Disciple** with a single historical eyewitness in a modern sense, yet attentive to the Gospel’s truth claims as theological testimony. Against reductive historicism and against uncritical harmonization, Lincoln reads John as a theologically driven, narratively unified **Gospel** whose Christology is rooted in the Father-Son relation and whose **realized eschatology** invites readers to experience life now.

The question of how historical criticism and ecclesial confession coinhere comes to a head in **Born of a Virgin?** (2013). Here Lincoln reexamines the **virginal conception**, weighing **Matthew** and **Luke’s** infancy narratives in light of **form criticism**, Jewish and Greco-Roman birth traditions, and the church’s **creedal** formulations. He argues that the narratives are theological constructions announcing the **incarnation** of the Son by the **Spirit**, not reports constrained by modern criteria of biological description. Lincoln contends that the early church confessed the saving identity of Jesus rather than the mechanics of his conception, and that theological fidelity does not require treating the **virgin birth** as historical in a literal register. He engages **Raymond E. Brown’s** classic work on the infancy narratives, voices appreciation for **Karl Barth’s** Christological focus while dissenting from Barth’s dogmatic insistence, and proposes that contemporary believers can affirm **God-with-us** without fastening doctrine to contested biological claims. The proposal crystallizes Lincoln’s conviction that **canonical reception** and critical history must be held in a discerning, if tensioned, relation.

Lincoln’s contribution to debates on the **Sabbath and the Lord’s Day** further exhibits his method. In his widely noted essay in **D. A. Carson’s** volume From Sabbath to Lord’s Day (1982) and in subsequent articles, Lincoln argues that the New Testament witnesses to a **fulfillment** of Sabbath rest in Christ rather than a direct transference of the **fourth commandment** into Christian obligation. He tracks **Jesus’ Sabbath controversies**, the **resurrection**’s first-day implications, and Pauline indifference to calendrical observance as indications that the church’s primary posture is toward the eschatological **rest** realized and anticipated in Christ. While not denying the wisdom of weekly assembly on the **Lord’s Day**, he resists rooting such practice in covenantal statute. The result is a biblical-theological picture of Sabbath as **creation fulfilled** rather than moral law repristinated, a thesis that has provoked vigorous engagement from confessional interpreters of the **Decalogue**.

Across these corpora runs a common set of hermeneutical convictions about **authorship, authority, and truth**. Lincoln neither collapses **Scripture’s authority** into positivist historiography nor vacates it into mere community projection. He proceeds with historical judgments about **pseudonymity** where evidence warrants, yet he insists that canonical placement and ecclesial use invest such writings with the authority of **apostolic tradition**. In **John**, this takes the form of honoring **witness** as a theological category that does not require modernist eyewitness verifiability. In **Paul**, it involves reading Ephesians or Colossians as pastoral theologies of **union with Christ** and **cosmic reconciliation**, even if their wording and argument reflect post-Pauline hands. Lincoln’s habit is to identify the text’s **inner logic**, locate it within **Second Temple** and Greco-Roman matrices, and then render its doctrinal claims in a manner intelligible to contemporary theology.

Lincoln’s interlocutors sketch his contours by contrast. His **Ephesians** commentary contends with **Peter T. O’Brien’s** robust defense of Pauline authorship and with **Harold Hoehner’s** maximalist historical reconstruction, choosing instead a more cautious judgment about **Deutero-Pauline** composition. His **John** work engages **Raymond E. Brown’s** community hypothesis and evaluates **Richard Bauckham’s** claims about the primacy of **eyewitness testimony**, preserving a theological account of witness while resisting reduction to modern criteria. In **Born of a Virgin?**, he contends with both conservative appeals to **creedal necessity** and liberal dismissals of doctrine, attempting a mediating path that privileges the **incarnation** rather than the mechanics of conception. Even on **Sabbath**, his reading stands between antinomian dismissal and strict **moral law** continuities, centering the eschatological import of **rest**. Throughout, Lincoln’s tone is judicious, his citations wide-ranging, and his arguments driven by close reading rather than programmatic ideology.

Theologically, Lincoln’s constructive center gravitates toward **realized eschatology** and **participatory Christology**. In **Paul**, believers inhabit the **heavenly realm** already, living as the new humanity under Christ’s headship, even as they await the fullness of **recapitulation**. In **John**, the **lawsuit** structure underscores the present crisis and verdict, given as the **Spirit-Paraclete** bears witness and creates faith. In **creedal** matters, Lincoln aims to honor the **regula fidei** as a hermeneutical guide while freeing it from unwarranted historical entailments. The canon’s force is not diminished by literary mediation or communal redaction; it is located precisely in God’s use of such mediation to witness to Christ. This is a chastened **theological interpretation** that listens hard to compositional history and yet expects doctrinal yield. Lincoln’s scholarship therefore models how **historical criticism** can subserve theological ends without giving the latter veto power over historical judgment.

Measured by the concerns of classical Reformed theology, a final evaluation shows both consonance and contestation. Lincoln’s attentiveness to **union with Christ**, **already and not yet**, and Johannine **witness** comports with a **redemptive-historical** reading that Reformed exegesis prizes, and his foregrounding of **anakephalaiosis** and **cosmic reconciliation** enriches covenantal accounts of creation and consummation. Yet his embrace of **pseudonymity** challenges Reformed commitments to Scripture’s **apostolicity** under the doctrine of **inspiration**, where many within classical orthodoxy see pseudonymous self-attribution as morally and theologically incongruent with **veracity**. His proposal in **Born of a Virgin?** presses hardest, since the **virginal conception** stands within the **Apostles’ Creed** and Nicene tradition as dogmatically significant for the **incarnation** and sinlessness of Christ; a Westminster-shaped stance would insist that historical denial here imperils the analogy of Scripture and the unity of **confession and canon**. Finally, his **Sabbath** conclusions collide with the Reformed reading of the **Decalogue** as abiding moral law, where Lord’s Day practice is covenantally grounded rather than merely prudential. A Reformed alternative would commend Lincoln’s exegetical care but recalibrate method by prioritizing the **analogia fidei**, reinforcing the integrity of **apostolic authorship**, affirming the historical **virgin birth** as a nonnegotiable of catholic orthodoxy, and construing **Sabbath** under the gracious economy of the **covenant of redemption and grace** rather than as optional eschatological symbol.
