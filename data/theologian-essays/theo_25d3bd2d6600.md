### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Daniel Castelo emerges as a constructive theologian within the **Methodist-Wesleyan** family whose work inhabits the intersection of **Wesleyan-Holiness** piety and **global Pentecostal** vitality, set against late-modern critiques of **foundationalism** and the retrievals of **ressourcement** and **postliberal** theology. His teaching and writing career matured through a long tenure at **Seattle Pacific University and Seminary** and a subsequent appointment at **Duke Divinity School** in 2020, institutions whose ecosystems prize **ecclesial catechesis**, **canonical interpretation**, and the life of **holiness**. He positions himself not as a system-builder in the old style but as a constructive guide, staging a conversation among **Wesley**, the **fathers** arrayed around **Pseudo-Dionysius** and **Gregory of Nyssa**, and modern figures like **Karl Barth** and **Sarah Coakley**. The guiding conviction is that theology is a **mystagogical discipline**: the church learns God by being led by the **Holy Spirit** into the mystery of **Christ** through **Scripture**, **sacrament**, and **sanctification**.

Methodologically, Castelo weds **apophatic theology** to **pneumatological epistemology**, insisting that the living **Spirit** both exceeds conceptual capture and yet reliably inducts the church into **sapiential knowledge**. He rejects both modern **evidentialist** and purely **expressivist** accounts of doctrine, advocating an ecclesially thick rationality akin to **canonical theism** as proposed by **William J. Abraham** and the **canonical approach** developed with **Robert W. Wall**. Knowledge of God is ordered by the **rule of faith** and disciplined by the **means of grace**, a Wesleyan grammar in which the **affections** are trained by the Spirit toward **holy love**. This yields a chastened confidence: a cataphatic confession anchored in **creed** and **canon**, coupled with apophatic reserve before the God who is **incomprehensible** and known only as he gives himself in the **divine missions**.

#### 2. Pneumatology and the mystical dimension of holiness
Castelo’s 2015 volume, **Pneumatology: A Guide for the Perplexed**, introduces students to the **Person and work of the Holy Spirit** within the flow of **Scripture**, **creedal confession**, and the **Wesleyan-Holiness** tradition. He traces the **processions** and **missions** of the Spirit, parsing classical trinitarian grammar while foregrounding how the Spirit sanctifies and guides the church in **discernment**, **charisms**, and **mission**. The emphasis is not on speculative mapping of the Spirit’s inner life so much as on a pastoral ontology of the Spirit’s **presence**: the Spirit forms habits of **holy love**, distributes **gifts** for the common good, and conforms believers to **Christ**. In this, Castelo draws on **Augustine’s** teaching on the Spirit as the **bond of love**, on **Aquinas’s** account of **habitus** and infused virtues, and on **Wesley’s** doctrine of **entire sanctification**, reframed by the language of **theosis**.

This pneumatological vision blooms in **Pentecostalism as a Christian Mystical Tradition** (2017), where Castelo contends that **Pentecostal spirituality** is best read as an instance of **Christian mysticism**, not as anti-intellectual enthusiasm. The triad of **testimony**, **glossolalia**, and **healing** is treated as a school of **mystagogy**, initiating the faithful into habits of attention to God’s **surprising presence**. Drawing on **Pseudo-Dionysius’s** apophatic cadence and **Gregory of Nyssa’s** epektasis, he interprets Pentecostal longings as a Spirit-led ascent into **divine love** that never exhausts the infinite God. The point is not to repudiate doctrinal clarity but to tether doctrinal discourse to the **ascetical and liturgical** practices through which the Spirit reveals and conceals the **mystery**. Here, Castelo engages **Amos Yong** and **Frank D. Macchia** on **charismatic theology**, while signaling convergences with **Sarah Coakley’s** vision of desire re-ordered by **contemplative prayer**.

#### 3. Scripture, canon, and ecclesial reason
With **Robert W. Wall**, Castelo co-authored **The Marks of Scripture** (2019), a constructive essay in **bibliology** that re-situates the Bible in the economy of **Word and Spirit** and within the **ecclesial canon**. Refusing a flat **biblicism** and equally resisting a purely **historical-critical** reduction, they argue that Scripture bears marks analogical to the church’s **one, holy, catholic, and apostolic** identity. The Bible is **holy** because it is set apart by the Spirit for sanctifying use; it is **apostolic** because it normed and norms the apostolic **kerygma**; it is **catholic** because it is for and within the whole people of God; it is **one** because its diverse witnesses are canonically shaped to yield a unified **rule of faith**. This is not an evasion of **inspiration** and **authority**, but a reframing: Scripture is **sacramental** of the **divine self-communication**, an instrument through which the **Triune God** addresses, judges, and heals the church.

The result is a **canonical rationality** that locates interpretation within the **communio sanctorum**. Castelo and Wall commend **lectio divina**, **creedal hermeneutics**, and the **lectionary** as means by which the Spirit school readers into the **mind of Christ**. In this trajectory, the Wesleyan **means of grace** shape reading, while the **rule of faith** regulates theological speculation. Castelo thus aligns with a family of thinkers, from **Barth’s** Word-Spirit dialectic to **Abraham’s** canonical theism, while retaining a distinct Wesleyan accent on **holy living** as the telos of biblical knowing. The upshot is that **doctrinal claims** are authorized not by autonomous reason but by the Spirit’s use of the **canonical Scriptures** in the church’s **catechesis** and **worship**.

#### 4. Wesleyan holiness, theosis, and entire sanctification
At the center of Castelo’s constructive project lies the **Wesleyan doctrine of holiness**, re-described through the patristic idiom of **theosis**. Following **John Wesley’s** insistence on **Christian perfection** understood as perfect **love**, he argues that the sanctified life is the Spirit’s participation of creatures in the **divine life** without blurring the **Creator-creature distinction**. The vocabulary of **theosis** allows Wesleyans to clarify that **entire sanctification** is not moralism but a **graced participation** in God’s holiness, mediated through **Scripture**, **sacrament**, and **ecclesial discipline**. Castelo retrieves **Aquinas** on grace as **habitus** and **virtue**, and reads Wesley’s practical divinity as a school of **ascetical theology** ordered to **charity**.

This holiness theology is eschatologically stretched. Drawing on **Gregory of Nyssa’s** epektasis and the **already-not yet** shape of New Testament sanctification, Castelo tempers triumphal accounts of **perfection** with apophatic reserve. The **Spirit** truly cleanses the heart and empowers **holy love**, yet the church presses on in **pilgrim** fashion toward the fullness of **beatitude**. This refuses quietism by honoring **prevenient grace**, **cooperant grace**, and the **synergy** of sanctification without collapsing into Pelagian self-assertion. The cumulative picture is Wesleyan: assurance is grounded in **Spirit-given witness**, holiness is enacted in **works of mercy**, and doctrine is barbered to the contours of **pastoral care**.

#### 5. Apophasis as ecclesial humility and theological method
Castelo’s commitment to **apophatic theology** functions as more than a devotional accent; it is a methodological posture for **dogmatics**. He draws on **Pseudo-Dionysius**, **Maximus the Confessor**, and modern exponents of negative theology to emphasize the **incomprehensibility** of the Triune God. For Castelo, apophasis guards **divine transcendence**, wards off **idolatrous concept capture**, and inculcates the humility essential to **ecclesial reasoning**. Yet it is never severed from **cataphatic confession**. The **creeds**, **Scriptures**, and **sacramental rites** materially specify the God Christians worship, even as the church confesses that God is known *via negativa* as beyond all our predications.

This apophatic stance informs pastoral discernment. It legitimates **silence**, **lament**, and **adoration** in the face of suffering and mystery, and protects the church from rationalist hubris. It shapes a **theology of prayer** where **charisms** are tested, **spirits** are discerned, and practices like **glossolalia** are interpreted as gestures of surrendered speech before the inexhaustible **Logos**. In concert with **Sarah Coakley’s** theologia as contemplation, Castelo insists that theological knowing is ascetic, patient, and Spirit-imbued. The outcome is a chastened clarity: the church speaks truly of **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **salvation**, while confessing that God exceeds even our most faithful names.

#### 6. Ecclesial pedagogy, doctrine, and the pastoral ends of knowledge
A constant throughout Castelo’s work is the conviction that **doctrine** is for **discipleship**. He follows **Randy L. Maddox’s** reading of Wesley as a **practical theologian**, shaping a pedagogical dogmatics in which the **virtues** and **affections** are formed toward **holy love**. The emphasis on **sapiential knowledge** resists the reduction of theology to cognitive assent and calls instead for **habituation** through the **means of grace**. Thus, bibliology aims at **communal discernment**, pneumatology at **mission** and **mutual upbuilding**, and sanctification at **Christiformity** across personal and social life. Castelo’s constructive voice is pastoral, a reminder that **holy living** is the end of **holy teaching**.

This pastoral orientation animates his collaborations with **Robert W. Wall** on **canonical** catechesis. The **marks of Scripture** are specified precisely to guide worshipping communities in reading the Bible as a **sacramental instrument** for sanctification. By elevating **lectio** and **liturgy**, by rooting exegesis in the **rule of faith**, and by orienting teaching to **mission**, Castelo intends to weave theology back into the grain of the church’s everyday practices. The ecclesial location of theology is not optional for him; it is a **pneumatological necessity**, an outworking of the Spirit’s concrete ministry in the **body of Christ**.

#### 7. Dialogues and debate partners
Castelo’s project is forged in conversation. From **John Wesley** he receives the grammar of **prevenient grace**, **assurance**, and **entire sanctification**; from **Pseudo-Dionysius** and **Gregory of Nyssa** the cadence of **apophasis** and **epektasis**; from **Aquinas** and **Augustine** a metaphysical and moral **habitus** tradition. He engages **Karl Barth** appreciatively for centering **revelation** and the **Christological Word**, while querying Barth’s frequent suspicion of **mysticism** and relative underdevelopment of **charisms**. With **William J. Abraham**, he shares the impulse toward **canonical theism**, even as Castelo tilts more toward **ecclesial practice** than toward a broader regime of **canonical** sources.

In the sphere of **Pentecostal** and **charismatic** theology, he is in close dialogue with **Amos Yong** on **pneumatological epistemology**, with **Frank D. Macchia** on **Spirit baptism** and **justification-sanctification** relations, and with **Simon Chan** on the **sacramental depth** of Pentecostal worship. In the Methodist guild he routinely converses with **Randy L. Maddox** and **Jason E. Vickers** on how **Wesleyan theosis** might be rendered in contemporary idiom. Across these engagements, Castelo stakes out a distinctive combination: a disciplined **apophatic humility**, a robust ecclesial **bibliology**, and an insistence that theology be measured by its capacity to foster **holiness**.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and abiding contribution
Taken together, Castelo’s contributions gather around three poles: a **pneumatological** center, an **apophatic** posture, and an **ecclesial-canonical** method, all ordered to **holiness**. His **pneumatology** keeps the Spirit’s person and work in view without dissociating the Spirit from **Christ** and the **Trinity**; the Spirit sanctifies, grants gifts, leads into **truth**, and conforms the church to Christ’s **cruciform** love. His **apophatic** commitments secure reverence and humility, resisting the domestication of God to human conceptual grasp while safeguarding the truthfulness of **creedal confession**. His **bibliology** recenters **canon** and **rule of faith**, advocating for a **sacramental** construal of Scripture that heals the divide between **academic exegesis** and **ecclesial reading**. And his appropriation of **Wesleyan theosis** reframes **entire sanctification** as Spirit-wrought participation in **holy love**, a life shaped by **means of grace** and **works of mercy**.

The abiding thesis is that theology must be a **mystagogy of holiness**. In a world of epistemic anxiety and moral fragmentation, Castelo calls the church to a Spirit-shaped way of knowing that is ecclesial, canonically governed, and practiced as **discipleship**. The energy of **Pentecostal mysticism** is harnessed to the sobriety of **patristic apophasis**; the urgency of **Wesleyan perfection** is tempered by eschatological patience; the authority of **Scripture** is re-inscribed within the living **communio** of the saints. On these axes, Castelo provides a map for contemporary Wesleyans and wider catholic Protestants to think and live toward **holiness**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and especially **Westminster** trajectory, several appreciations and tensions emerge. First, there is deep resonance with Castelo’s **Word-Spirit** accent, his insistence that **doctrine serves discipleship**, and his recovery of **ecclesial reading**. His rendering of **holiness** as Spirit-wrought participation in **Christ** coheres with a Reformed account of **union with Christ**, **definitive** and **progressive sanctification**, and the priority of **grace**. Likewise, his **apophatic humility** can be welcomed as a salutary guardrail that protects **divine aseity** and counters rationalist presumption.

Yet tensions remain. Reformed theology insists on **claritas Scripturae** and **sufficiency** under **sola Scriptura**, fearing that a strongly **sacramental** and **ecclesial** construal of Scripture could drift toward **sola ecclesia** and weaken the Bible’s self-authenticating **perspicuity**. Castelo’s **apophatic reserve**, while salutary, risks muting the clear **covenantal** promissory content of revelation when pushed beyond the creedal-canonical frame he affirms. His Wesleyan account of **entire sanctification** and **theosis** strains against the Reformed axiom **simul iustus et peccator**, which guards the believer’s continuing sin even amid real Spirit-given growth; Reformed dogmatics would rest sanctification more explicitly in **union with Christ** administered through the **ordinary means of grace** in the covenant of **grace**, without teleologizing toward perfection in this life. Finally, a Reformed account would seek to ground **charismatic discernment** more explicitly in the closed **canon** and the ordinary **ministry of Word and sacrament**, wary of locating theological normativity in experience, however ecclesially disciplined. Even so, Castelo’s project offers Reformed readers a pressing reminder that **pneumatology**, **holiness**, and **ecclesial practice** must be integral to any faithful **dogmatics**.
