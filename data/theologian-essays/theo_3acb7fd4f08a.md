### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation in a conciliar century
Born in 1928 at Sursee near Lucerne, **Hans Küng** matured intellectually in the crucible of postwar Catholicism as it turned toward **Vatican II** and the modern world. Ordained in 1954 after studies at the **Gregorian University** in Rome, he completed a 1957 Sorbonne dissertation, **Justification: The Doctrine of Karl Barth and a Catholic Reflection**, arguing that **Barth’s sola fide** and **Trent’s De iustificatione** could be read in real convergence under a shared commitment to **grace** and **Christocentrism**. This early book already signaled Küng’s hallmark: a theological **ecumenism** seeking credible continuity amid reform. Appointed in 1960 to the **University of Tübingen**, he founded the **Institute for Ecumenical Research** in 1963 and served as a peritus at the Council from 1962 to 1965, where themes of **collegiality**, **people of God**, and **aggiornamento** intersected with his developing ecclesiology. In dialogue with **Karl Rahner**, **Yves Congar**, and at first in collegial proximity to **Joseph Ratzinger**, Küng absorbed **ressourcement** impulses while exercising a rigorous **historical-critical** method oriented to the plausibility of faith in a disenchanted world.

Küng’s context was defined by the collapse of triumphalist **neo-scholasticism** and the rise of new conversations with **modernity**, **science**, and **secular rationality**. His theological temperament combined a Swiss clarity with a European attentiveness to **Kant**, **Hume**, **Nietzsche**, and **Freud**, seeking a mode of **fundamental theology** that could defend Christianity’s **credibility** without appeals to a fortress of **infallibility**. The Council’s language of **subsistit in** and the retrieval of *sensus fidelium* encouraged his conviction that authentic Catholicity lives by reform under the **Gospel**, not by juridical **immutability**.

#### 2. Method: credibility, correlation, and reform
The architectonic of Küng’s method is best summarized as a theology of **credibility** verified in **praxis**, using **correlation** without capitulating to relativism. Against a static **manualism**, he insists that theology must be both **historical** and **critical**, engaging the *geschichtliche* development of doctrine and the concrete questions of late modern consciousness. He argues in **On Being a Christian** 1974 and **Does God Exist?** 1978 that Christian claims seek rational **warrant** as existentially and morally fitting explanations of reality and life, not as apodictic deductions from an unassailable **magisterium**. The language of **verification** is not positivist but practical and holistic, akin to **Kant’s** insistence on the primacy of **practical reason**, where the truth of God is recognized as the horizon and ground of unconditional moral obligation and hope.

Küng advances this method through **paradigm theory**, especially in **Theology for the Third Millennium** 1988 and **Christianity** 1994, drawing on **Thomas Kuhn** to narrate Christian doctrinal history as a sequence of **paradigm shifts**. He distinguishes early **apocalyptic**, **Hellenistic**, **Roman Catholic**, **Reformation**, and **Enlightenment** paradigms, arguing that fidelity to the **regula fidei** occurs not by rigid uniformity but by critical continuity within change. The guiding hermeneutic is **reformist**: *ecclesia semper reformanda* under the Word, yet in Küng’s proposal the norm is the **primal Jesus event**, the **kerygma** about the **kingdom of God**, and the apostolic witness read with historical-critical sobriety. He prefers the language of **truthfulness** to metaphysical **immutability**, urging a Church that listens to the *sensus fidelium* and practices **collegiality**.

#### 3. Ecclesiology: people of God, collegiality, and the Petrine ministry
Küng’s early ecclesiology in **The Church** 1967 aligns with conciliar emphases on the **people of God**, **episcopal collegiality**, and **mission**. He criticizes authoritarian centralization and proposes a primacy of **service** within the **Petrine ministry**, reclaiming patristic and conciliar memories where Rome’s **primacy** was exercised for unity rather than **absolutism**. The Council’s **Lumen Gentium** and **Unitatis Redintegratio** supplied an ecumenical grammar that Küng extends through concrete proposals for **synodality**, local **inculturation**, and mutual recognition among communions. He reads the controversial **subsistit in** not as an exclusivist claim to ecclesial identity but as a call to humility about the Church’s historical failures and openness to **ecumenical convergence**.

The decisive flashpoint came with **Infallible? An Inquiry** 1970, where Küng argued that the doctrine of **papal infallibility** as defined in **Vatican I** is neither necessary to the **Gospel** nor convincingly grounded in the **New Testament** or the undivided Church. He distinguished the Church’s **indefectibility** in the **truth of the Gospel** from any juridical guarantee of errorlessness in specific **magisterial** acts. While affirming the need for a **teaching office**, he argued for its **fallibility** and for a model of communal discernment rooted in **Scripture**, **tradition**, and the ongoing reception by the **whole Church**. The **Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith** withdrew his **missio canonica** in 1979, yet he remained a priest and continued as professor of **ecumenical theology** at Tübingen, thereby embodying both the pain and possibility of postconciliar Catholic debate.

#### 4. Christology and discipleship in On Being a Christian
The heart of Küng’s project is unmistakably **Christological**, with **On Being a Christian** 1974 as the centerpiece. Here he offers a thick exposition of **Jesus of Nazareth** as the decisive **norm** of Christian existence, integrating **historical Jesus** research and **Easter faith**. He resists both docetic **mythologizing** and reductive **demythologizing**, instead treating the **miracles** as signs of the **kingdom**, the **proexistence** of Jesus for others as the formal shape of **atonement**, and the **resurrection** as God’s eschatological vindication that grounds concrete **discipleship**. In place of scholastic metaphysics alone, Küng frames **Trinitarian** confession through the narrative of **Father**, **Jesus the Son**, and **Spirit** in the economy of salvation, seeking to preserve **homoousios** not as a speculative formula but as shorthand for the saving identity of the crucified and risen Lord.

Küng accentuates **discipleship** as praxis: to be Christian is to follow **Jesus** into the path of **justice**, **mercy**, and **truthfulness** within the structures of modern society. The **Sermon on the Mount**, the **kingdom parables**, and the **cross** anchor his ethic. He is wary of **penal substitution** formulae when they become isolated theories, preferring to speak of Jesus’ **representative** and **vicarious** self-gift that conquers alienation and inaugurates the **new creation**. Soteriology is framed as **grace** that calls forth **freedom**, a theme extending from **Pauline** justification to the existential urgency of faith in a secular age.

#### 5. Apologetics for late modernity: Does God Exist? and Eternal Life?
In **Does God Exist? An Answer for Today** 1978, Küng undertakes a panoramic conversation with **ancient proofs**, **Kant’s** critique, and modern **atheism**. He neither repeats classical **natural theology** nor abandons rational responsibility. The result is an argument for the **rational permissibility** and existential **superiority** of theism grounded in the coherence of the **world’s contingency**, the inescapability of **moral obligation**, and the integrity of **selfhood**. Influenced by **Wittgenstein’s** attention to forms of life and **Kant’s** practical postulates, Küng contends that belief in God is the most adequate horizon for human **truthfulness**, **freedom**, and **hope**. His apologetic is a wager of **trust** grounded in responsible reasoning, not a coercive demonstration.

In **Eternal Life?** 1982, he sets Christian **eschatology** against speculative **immortality** of the soul, preferring the biblical hope of **resurrection** as God’s act rather than human possession. He resists crude literalism while insisting on the **realism** of Christian hope, articulating **judgment** and **salvation** within the wider horizon of divine **mercy** and justice. The question of **hell** is treated soberly, with emphasis on the seriousness of freedom without presuming a populated inferno. These works display his constant dialectic: fidelity to **Scripture** and **tradition** joined to modern intelligibility, anchoring **credibility** in a holistic vision of life before God.

#### 6. Interreligious horizon and the world ethic
From the 1990s, Küng’s attention shifted decisively toward **interreligious dialogue** and **global ethics**. In **Judaism** 1991, **Christianity** 1994, and **Islam** 2007, he offered learned and sympathetic yet critical portraits of the three **Abrahamic** faiths, pressing for mutual understanding and substantive **theological** engagement. His work with the **Parliament of the World’s Religions** culminated in the 1993 **Declaration Toward a Global Ethic**, and his books **Global Responsibility** 1991 and **A Global Ethic for Global Politics and Economics** 1998 articulated minimal but robust moral imperatives: **nonviolence**, **justice**, **truthfulness**, and **partnership** of men and women. These are not substitutes for **revelation**, he insisted, but shared **practical reason** capable of underwriting a fragile global consensus.

The global ethic is programmatic for Küng’s reading of history: given pluralism, any peaceable future requires **religious** traditions to retrieve their ethical **core** in dialogical humility. He argues that **human dignity**, the negative **Golden Rule**, and commitments to **life**, **solidarity**, and **truth** are discoverable within the internal grammars of major religions and in secular **humanism**. This is a wager on **convergent moral reason** without obliterating doctrinal distinctives. It also coheres with his earlier critique of **infallibility**, since a Church committed to **truthfulness** should model a fallible process of learning, repentance, and joint action for the common good.

#### 7. Conflict and persistence: teaching office and conscience
The 1979 removal of Küng’s **missio canonica** by the **Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith** marked a public rupture over **magisterial authority** and the boundaries of Catholic theology. Under **Cardinal Franjo Seper**, and later within the climate shaped by **Joseph Ratzinger**, the Roman center judged Küng’s critique of **infallibility** and his proposals on **contraception**, **celibacy**, and **women’s roles** incompatible with doctrinal security. Küng responded by emphasizing **freedom of conscience**, the priority of the **Gospel**, and the need for **collegial** governance consonant with the ancient Church. He remained a priest in good standing, continued to supervise doctoral work, and published widely, including **The Catholic Church: A Short History** 2001 and later polemical calls for reform such as **Can We Save the Catholic Church?** 2013.

This conflict illuminates Küng’s ecclesial vision. He defended a **teaching office** that teaches courageously yet recognizes its own **fallibility** and seeks correction from **Scripture**, **tradition**, and the **people of God**. He invoked the patristic maxim *prima sedes a nemine iudicatur* not as a shield for **absolutism** but as a call to a **Petrine** service under the **Word**. The controversy also hardened differences with **Ratzinger**, whose **The Ratzinger Report** 1985 and later works defended a hermeneutic of **continuity** and robust **magisterium**. Küng, by contrast, proposed a hermeneutic of **reform** capable of naming doctrinal overdevelopments and inviting **synodality**.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis and style
Though a prolific essayist and public intellectual, Küng’s doctrinal contribution can be summarized as a coherent set of **axioms**. First, **Christological normativity**: the **Jesus event** and **apostolic witness** define the criterion for authentic tradition. Second, **ecclesial fallibility** with **indefectibility** of the **Gospel**: the **Church** can err and must be reformed, yet Christ remains faithful to his **body**. Third, **rational responsibility** and **credibility**: theology argues in the court of human reason without abandoning revealed **mystery**. Fourth, **ecumenical catholicity**: the **Tridentine** and **Barthian** streams can converge in **justification** and grace, as his 1957 book contended. Fifth, **global ethic**: a morally serious **public theology** that does not collapse **theology** into politics, but supplies a universalizable **ethic** for a shared world.

Stylistically, Küng combined **academic rigor** with accessible prose, producing bestsellers like **On Being a Christian** that reached broad audiences. He favored clear **contrasts** over baroque metaphysics, often deploying **biblical** categories and **historical** argument to reframe disputed doctrines. His **memoirs** and public interviews also shaped perceptions, casting him as a reformer under sanction. Yet beneath the controversy lay a consistent **method**: retrieve, criticize, and propose anew for the sake of Christian **truthfulness** and human **flourishing**.

#### 9. Influence and horizon of reception
Küng’s influence is extensive across **Catholic**, **Protestant**, and **secular** spheres. At **Vatican II**, his voice contributed to the climate that produced **Lumen Gentium**, **Unitatis Redintegratio**, and **Gaudium et Spes**, even if his specific proposals went further than the conciliar texts. His ecumenical reading of **justification** anticipated later convergences, including the 1999 **Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification**. His defense of **conscience**, critique of **infallibility**, and advocacy of **collegiality** have resurfaced in debates under **Pope Francis** about **synodality** and **reform**. In the wider culture, his **global ethic** has energized conversations at the **United Nations**, the **World Economic Forum**, and interfaith initiatives.

Critically, his work provoked strong responses from **Joseph Ratzinger**, **Hans Urs von Balthasar**, and defenders of robust **magisterial** continuity. Protestant critics have queried whether his **correlation** method risks dissolving **revelation** into **experience**, while secular philosophers have debated the adequacy of his **practical reason** apologetic. Nonetheless, his books remain touchstones in courses on **fundamental theology**, **ecclesiology**, and **interreligious** studies, and his death in 2021 sparked assessments that recognize both his **courage** and the unfinished tasks of **Catholic reform**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classic **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Küng’s project exhibits admirable strengths alongside decisive tensions. Positively, his critique of **ecclesiastical absolutism**, his advocacy of **collegiality**, and his ecumenical rapprochement on **justification** resonate with a Reformed insistence that the **Church** stands under the **Word**. His sober **historical** work and focus on **Christological** normativity align with a Reformed principle of *norma normans* in **Scripture** and the derivative authority of **tradition**. Yet his disavowal of **infallibility** is joined to a **correlation** method and praxis-verification that, to Reformed ears, threatens the sufficiency and normativity of **special revelation**, shifting the locus of authority toward **reason** and **experience**. His **apologetic** by practical reason, while valuable, can appear to subordinate **revelation** to **plausibility** within late modern canons. In **Christology** and **atonement**, his preference for **representation** and **proexistence** underplays **penal substitution** and covenantal **satisfaction** central to **Reformed** soteriology. His **global ethic** articulates a helpful common-moral grammar, but the Reformed doctrine of **common grace** would insist that any true natural-law convergence remains subordinate to and judged by **Scripture**, respecting the antithesis between **idolatry** and **covenant** faith. Finally, his hermeneutic of **paradigm shifts** risks relativizing dogma, whereas a Reformed alternative commends **catholicity** through confessional **stability** and reform by the **Word**, not by the felt necessities of **modernity**. A constructive Reformed alternative would affirm **conciliarity** under **sola Scriptura**, a robust doctrine of **inerrancy**, and a thick account of **grace** in covenantal history, retrieving catholic breadth without conceding the primacy of **credibility** over **revelation**.
