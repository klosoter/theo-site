### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and evangelical method
David W. Pao emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** New Testament theologian whose scholarly vocation is set at the confluence of **Second Temple Judaism**, the **Septuagint**, and the postcritical turn to **canonical interpretation**. Educated in elite research contexts and shaped by the rigor of **Harvard**-style historical inquiry while serving within a confessional setting at **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School**, Pao embodies the broad evangelical confidence that **Scripture** possesses a coherent divine discourse. Against the fragmentation typical of late twentieth-century **historical-critical** models, he advances a chastened yet constructive **canonical intertextuality** that insists that Luke and Paul are best understood through the dense allusive network of the **LXX** and the narrative grammar of **Israel's Scriptures**.

Pao's method is anchored in **grammatico-historical** exegesis and an epistemic modesty that refuses speculative **reader-response** freedom while still embracing **intertextual echoes** as genuinely authorially signaled. His work navigates between **Brevard Childs's canonical approach**, which privileges final form and ecclesial reception, and **Richard B. Hays's** criteria for detecting echoes, insisting on textual, thematic, and structural convergence as controls. Theologically he reads the New Testament as the enactment of **God's eschatological promises** to Israel, an *ad extra* realization of themes like **new exodus**, **new creation**, and **kingdom of God** that flow from the prophetic corpus with special concentration in **Isaiah 40–66**. This yields a hermeneutic in which the **church's mission** is Scripture-shaped, the **ekklesia** is scripturalized in identity and practice, and **ethics** is doxologically ordered by **thanksgiving**.

#### 2. Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus
Pao's signature contribution, **Acts and the Isaianic New Exodus** 2000, reframes Lukan theology around the prophetic architecture of **Isaiah**. Against **Hans Conzelmann's** epochal scheme of salvation history and against readings that isolate **Luke** from the prophetic matrix, Pao argues that Luke narrates the **new exodus** inaugurated in **Jesus** and continued in **Acts**. He traces Lukan programmatic signals such as **Luke 4** and **Acts 1:8** to **Isaianic** motifs of the **Servant**, the **light to the Gentiles** Isa 49:6, and the journey motif captured in *hodos* the way. The repeated Lukan phrase to the **ends of the earth** resonates with Isa 49:6 and 52:10 LXX, signaling that the geographical spread from **Jerusalem** to **Rome** is not incidental but teleologically aimed at the **ingathering of the nations**.

Crucially, Pao contends that **Acts** is organized around the growth of the **word of God** Acts 6:7; 12:24; 19:20 as the agent of exodus-deliverance from **idolatry** and **oppression**. This emphasis renders mission both proclamation-centered and **Scripture-fulfilling**, aligning the early Christian movement with the Isaianic promises of **new creation** and **Spirit outpouring**. By reading **Acts 13:47** as Paul's self-conscious appropriation of **Isaiah 49:6**, Pao situates Pauline mission within Israel's **servant vocation**, thus subverting accounts that reduce Acts to **imperial negotiation** or sheer **sociopolitical resistance**. The **new exodus** is theological before it is political, though it refracts into public realities as idolaters are turned to the **living God**.

As a historical proposal, this Isaianic reading engages the scholarship of **C. K. Barrett**, **I. Howard Marshall**, and **David Peterson** while challenging **Richard Pervo** and other literary-minimalist accounts that sever **Acts** from prophetic coherence. Methodologically, Pao insists on textual markers, LXX lexical clusters, and narrative structuring to check **intertextual overreach**, thereby offering a disciplined extension of **Richard B. Hays's** echo criteria. The resulting portrait is a **Lukan ecclesiology** defined by Scripture: the people of the **way** are the people of the **word**, enacting the **exodus** of the nations by bearing **witness** in the power of the **Spirit**.

#### 3. Scripturalization, mission, and ecclesiology
A second line of Pao's contribution is his account of **scripturalization** in **Luke-Acts**, the process by which the church's identity, practices, and mission are indwelt by **Israel's Scriptures**. He shows how **synagogue patterns**, **psalmic prayer**, and **Isaianic hope** configure the community's **worship** and **witness**, forming a **hermeneutical ecclesiology**. This scripturalization is not mere proof-texting but a comprehensive relocation of the **Gentiles** into the **Abrahamic** and **Davidic** trajectories through the **Christ event**. The **Jerusalem council** Acts 15 becomes emblematic: **Amos 9** is read through the **LXX** to legitimate the inclusion of the nations as the rebuilding of **David's tent**, an Isaianic-shaped exodus moment for Gentiles leaving **idols** for the **true God**.

Here the contrast with **postcolonial** and **empire-critical** readings of **Acts** is instructive. While not denying the imperial context of **Rome**, Pao resists reducing the narrative to a code of **resistance** and instead maintains the primacy of **promise-fulfillment**. The church's **mission** is neither voluntarist activism nor ethnic replacement but the **eschatological realization** of prophetic **Scripture**, a movement whose authority resides in the **word** that grows and prevails. This yields an ecclesiology that is simultaneously **centripetal** gathered around Scripture and **centrifugal** propelled to the **nations**, a pattern indebted to **Isaiah's** pilgrimage of the peoples to **Zion** and the **Servant's** light to the ends of the earth.

#### 4. Pauline theology of thanksgiving
If **Acts** provides Pao's macro-canonical frame, **Thanksgiving: An Investigation of a Pauline Theme** 2002 offers his most distinctive contribution to **Pauline theology** and ethics. Pao argues that **eucharistia** and **eucharistein** are not decorative pieties but constitute a structuring principle in **Paul**. Drawing from **Romans 1**, he locates **ingratitude** as the crux of **idolatry**: knowing God, humans did not glorify him as God nor give **thanks**. For **Paul**, the redeemed life reorders this primal distortion through comprehensive **thanksgiving**, which becomes the posture of restored worship and the generative source of **ethics**. In **Colossians** and **Ephesians**, the frequency of thanksgiving Col 1:3, 12; 2:7; 3:15–17; 4:2 signals a community ethos in which speech, song, and conduct are caught up in doxological **gratitude**.

Pao's study canvasses **Second Temple Jewish** thanksgiving traditions and **Greco-Roman** gratitude conventions to differentiate **Paul's** doxological realism from patronage-driven reciprocity. In **Paul**, **grace** destroys calculus; **thanksgiving** is not debt repayment but participation in the **new creation** wrought by **Christ** and the **Spirit**. Thus **ethics** arises as the grateful embodiment of salvation, a pattern that aligns with the **Heidelberg Catechism's** organization of Christian doctrine into **guilt, grace, and gratitude**. By relocating virtue under the canopy of **eucharistia**, Pao offers a theological anthropology in which **worship** is the root and **obedience** the fruit, thereby integrating **soteriology** and **ethics** and resisting both antinomianism and moralism.

#### 5. Colossians, cosmic Christology, and household holiness
Pao's **Colossians and Philemon** ZECNT 2012 synthesizes his intertextual and ethical interests in a sustained commentary. Reading the **Christ-hymn** Col 1:15–20 through **Genesis**, **Wisdom**, and **Exodus** resonances, he foregrounds **cosmic Christology**: Christ as **firstborn** and **creator**, the one in whom and for whom all things were made and are reconciled. He aligns with and nuances the scholarship of **Gordon Fee** and **N. T. Wright** by tethering cosmic scope to **cultic** and **exodus** imagery, framing **reconciliation** as the climactic deliverance from the **powers**. The **principalities and powers** are not abstract metaphysics but defeated rivals displaced in the **new exodus** through the **cross**.

In the ethical sections, Pao highlights how **thanksgiving** saturates **Colossians 3** and shapes **household codes**, re-scripting ancient **oikos** relations under the **lordship of Christ**. He resists readings that domesticate these codes into mere social conservatism by showing how **Christ's** cosmic sovereignty relativizes power, creating zones of mutuality and service. The community's speech is to be filled with **psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs**, a liturgical ecology that sustains **eucharistic ethics**. The connection to **Philemon** intensifies this: the **household** becomes the theater where **reconciliation** and **gratitude** prove their reality in concrete social reconfigurations.

#### 6. OT in the NT and canonical coherence
As a contributor to **Commentary on the New Testament Use of the Old Testament** 2007, Pao together with colleagues like **Eckhard J. Schnabel** advances an evangelical consensus on controlled **intertextuality**. His entries on **Acts** and related corpora deploy lexical, thematic, and structural analysis to delineate **citation**, **allusion**, and **echo**, reinforcing that the New Testament authors write as scriptural theologians. This work sits alongside and occasionally against more expansive **intertextual** claims, underscoring that **authorial intention** and **textual signals** remain decisive. The cumulative effect is a model of **canonical coherence**: the **Old Testament** is not background noise but the very medium through which the **gospel** is narrated and understood.

This canonical stance places Pao in fruitful conversation with **Brevard Childs** on final-form reading, while retaining evangelical commitments to **inspiration**, **inerrancy**, and the **unity of Scripture**. He treats the **LXX** not as a problem to be solved but as the providential linguistic world in which **apostolic** authors think and speak, rendering **theology** inseparable from **translation**. The theological upshot is that doctrines like **mission**, **ecclesiology**, and **Christology** are exegetically generated from scriptural intertext not imposed from later dogmatic schemes, even as classic dogmatics find robust biblical warrants when read through this lens.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
Throughout his corpus, Pao engages and often corrects trajectories set by **Hans Conzelmann** on **Lukan salvation history**, pushes back against **Richard Pervo's** literary skepticism, and dialogues with **Jacob Jervell** on **Israel** in **Acts**. He appropriates **Richard B. Hays's** careful criteria for **echo** detection while bracketing more speculative uses of **intertextuality** drawn from postmodern literary theory. In **Pauline** studies, he interacts with voices that emphasize **apocalyptic** discontinuity, proposing instead that **apocalyptic** and **covenantal** coinhere in the Isaianic **new exodus** wherein **Christ** fulfills and reconstitutes Israel's story for the **nations**.

On **ethics**, Pao's **thanksgiving** thesis sparks conversation with virtue-ethical proposals and with accounts of **grace** and **works** in **Paul**. By making **eucharistia** architectonic, he both resonates with **Reformed** accounts of gratitude and invites questions about the relation between **gratitude**, **union with Christ**, and **the law**. In **Colossians**, his focus on **cosmic Christology** situates him amid debates on **Christus Victor** and **penal substitution**, where his exodus-shaped **atonement** emphasizes liberative and reconciling dimensions without excluding juridical themes. Across these debates, the constant is methodological: the **LXX** and the **prophets** rule the way to doctrinal synthesis.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis: mission, Scripture, and ethics
Bringing his threads together, Pao offers a doctrinally suggestive triad: **mission** is the enactment of **Isaiah's** **new exodus** to the **nations**; **Scripture** is the constitutive environment of ecclesial identity and proclamation; **ethics** is the grateful life of a people delivered. This triad turns on the sovereignty of the **word of God** in **Acts**, the ubiquity of **thanksgiving** in **Paul**, and the supremacy of **Christ** in **Colossians**. The **church** exists as the community shaped by **Scripture** and sent by the **Spirit** to announce **forgiveness** and **freedom** to idolaters, thereby extending the **exodus** to the ends of the earth.

Such a synthesis refuses dichotomies between **kerygma** and **ethos**. The **gospel** generates a people whose speech is doxological and whose social relations are reordered under **Christ's** cosmic lordship. Theologically, this pattern is compatible with a robust doctrine of **providence** and **grace**, since **thanksgiving** presupposes the primacy of **divine initiative** and the gratuity of salvation. Pao's work thus offers an integrative biblical theology in which the **narrative** of **Scripture** structures **dogmatics** without collapsing doctrinal reflection into mere summary of texts.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Pao's contributions align with **Vosian** and **Ridderbosian** commitments to **redemptive history**, **covenant**, and the **organic unity of Scripture**. His Isaianic **new exodus** thesis coheres with classic **typology**, and his **thanksgiving** ethic comports with the **Heidelberg Catechism's** gratitude as the shape of sanctification. Strengths include his disciplined **intertextual** controls, his insistence on the primacy of the **word** in **mission**, and his tethering of **ethics** to **worship**. Two tensions invite sharpening by classical Reformed categories. First, on **Israel–church** relations in **Acts**, a Westminster idiom would press clearer covenantal articulation of continuity and discontinuity, ensuring that the **new exodus** honors the irrevocable character of **Abrahamic** promises while maintaining **Christ's** headship over the one **people of God**. Second, in **atonement** emphasis within **Colossians**, a WTS evaluation would supplement Pao's robust **Christus Victor** and reconciliation accents with explicit **penal substitution** as the legal ground of victory, preserving the forensic dimension central to **Reformed soteriology**. Methodologically, a Westminster hermeneutic applauds Pao's **canonical realism** but urges constant discipline in detecting **echoes** to avoid the slippage from **authorial intention** to readerly ingenuity. In sum, Pao provides a model of evangelical biblical theology that Reformed dogmatics can receive gladly, refine by covenantal clarity, and deploy for preaching the **word** that advances the **new exodus** to the **nations**.
