### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
J. P. Moreland emerged within the late twentieth-century revival of **analytic philosophy** among evangelicals, particularly at **Biola University and Talbot School of Theology** where he served as Distinguished Professor of Philosophy from the 1990s onward. Trained under **Dallas Willard** at the University of Southern California and formed in the orbit of **evangelical apologetics**, Moreland’s scholarship was catalyzed by the hegemony of **scientific naturalism** in the academy and the corresponding decline of Christian intellectual confidence. The formative context of **post-Quinean metaphysics**, mid-century debates over **universals**, and the explosive growth of the **philosophy of mind** in the wake of **functionalism** and **physicalism** shaped his agenda. Moreland’s method is unapologetically **analytic**, combining close argumentation, metaphysical system-building, and careful use of scientific data while resisting **scientism** as an epistemic imperialism that confuses empirical success with metaphysical ultimacy. Theologically, his project is a species of **philosophical theology** that seeks to clarify and defend core Christian claims about the **soul**, **God**, and the **imago Dei** by deploying public reasons within a shared *ordo rationis*.

Against the backdrop of **logical positivism’s** collapse and the rise of **realist metaphysics** in the Anglophone world, Moreland adopted **metaphysical realism**, **constituent ontology**, and **moderate foundationalism** as his philosophical scaffolding. He is a theorist of **agent causation** and **libertarian free will**, an advocate of **substance dualism**, and a critic of both **eliminative materialism** and **nonreductive physicalism**. His perspective is shaped by engagement with figures like **Alvin Plantinga** on **proper function** and **warrant**, but he adopts a more direct **classical natural theology** stance than Reformed epistemology’s permission for **properly basic theism**. In short, his method seeks a robustly argued, metaphysically thick account of the **human person** and **divine reality** that can withstand the reductive pressures of **naturalism**.

#### 2. Early apologetic program and the critique of scientism
Moreland’s public voice first crystallized in **Scaling the Secular City** 1987, a programmatic work that deployed **cosmological**, **teleological**, **moral**, and **historical** arguments to commend **Christian theism** in the marketplace of ideas. It was followed by **Christianity and the Nature of Science** 1989, a philosophical intervention that challenged **scientism** and argued for a nuanced **philosophy of science** consistent with **theistic metaphysics**. He pressed the distinction between the epistemic authority of the **hard sciences** and the illegitimate expansion of **scientism** into a global ontology, invoking **Thomas Kuhn** on paradigms, **Karl Popper** on falsifiability, and **Imre Lakatos** on research programs while insisting that the sciences operate within broader **metaphysical** and **axiological** commitments.

His editorial leadership in **The Creation Hypothesis** 1994 and later contributions to **Theistic Evolution?** 2017 placed Moreland among the principal evangelical critics of **methodological naturalism** in origins debates. While not bound to any single **creationist** chronology, he defended the legitimacy of **intelligent design** as an inference to the best explanation given biological **complexity** and **information**. Moreland’s core target remained **scientism**, a theme he consolidated in **Scientism and Secularism** 2018, where he distinguished science as a fine tool from scientism as a pseudo-philosophy that cannot justify its own criterion of knowledge. This line of argument was a standing invitation to reconsider **natural theology**, **miracles**, and **divine action** beyond a naturalist veto.

#### 3. Philosophy of mind: the soul, consciousness, and agency
The heart of Moreland’s philosophical theology is a sustained defense of **substance dualism** and a robust, unitary **soul**. In **Body & Soul** 2000 with **Scott Rae**, he argued that the **human person** is a **substantial soul** that grounds **personal identity**, **moral agency**, and **rationality**, with the body as a contingent instrument of expression. He advanced standard arguments from **intentionality**, **qualia**, **subjective character**, **first-person perspective**, and the **unity of consciousness**, contending that these mental phenomena resist reductive explanation in **physicalist** terms. Drawing on and critiquing **Jaegwon Kim’s** exclusion argument, he defended **mental causation** via **agent causation** rather than event-causation, thereby preserving the downward causal relevance of the **mental** without collapsing into **epiphenomenalism**.

In **Consciousness and the Existence of God** 2008, Moreland developed the **argument from consciousness**: if finite consciousness exists with its irreducible **qualitative** and **intentional** properties, then a **cosmic Mind** is the best explanatory ultimate. He compared the explanatory power of **theism** and **naturalism**, arguing that under **theism** consciousness is metaphysically unsurprising given a foundational **conscious agent** with **intentionality**, whereas under **naturalism** consciousness is an explanatory outlier. He interacted with **David Chalmers** on the hard problem, **Daniel Dennett** and **Paul Churchland** on eliminativism, and **Joseph Levine** on the explanatory gap, insisting that the gap is ontological, not merely epistemic. The follow-up **The Recalcitrant Imago Dei** 2009 widened the lens, arguing that human attributes like **rational insight**, **free will**, **intrinsic value**, and **moral obligations** are recalcitrant data for **naturalism** but fit native expectations of **theism** and the **imago Dei**.

#### 4. Metaphysics: universals, abstracta, and divine aseity
Moreland’s constructive **metaphysics** integrates the philosophy of mind with a realist account of **universals**. In **Universals** 2001, he defended a **realist** but carefully bounded view, leveraging **D. M. Armstrong’s** work while favoring a **constituent ontology** in which particulars are complexes of **substance** and **immanent universals**. This position supports genuine **property instantiation**, explanatory **natural kinds**, and the intelligibility of **causal powers**, all of which buttress his accounts of **mental properties** and **agent causation**. The ontology of **immanent universals** serves his theological interest in preserving **divine aseity** by avoiding an inflated **Platonism** of uncreated, necessarily existing abstracta that would rival the **aseity** of **the triune God**.

That theme surfaces again in his editorial and dialogical work, including the **Blackwell Companion to Natural Theology** 2009 with **William Lane Craig**, and in debates collected in **Beyond the Control of God?** 2014 in which he engaged proposals concerning **abstract objects**, **divine conceptualism**, and **absolute creationism**. Moreland’s trajectory has been to resist both robust **Platonism** that threatens **God’s aseity** and nominalist dissolutions that evacuate the metaphysical ground of **laws**, **properties**, and **essences**. The upshot is a metaphysic conducive to **classical theism** while attentive to analytic rigor: the world is structured by real **natures**, truth is correspondence to **facts**, and the intellect can track **universals** because the world is intrinsically intelligible under the wise **Logos**.

#### 5. Epistemology, natural theology, and public reason
Methodologically, Moreland defends **moderate foundationalism** with a place for **properly basic beliefs** but privileges **evidence**, **arguments**, and **intellectual virtue** in apologetic persuasion. In **Philosophical Foundations for a Christian Worldview** 2003, coauthored with **William Lane Craig**, he surveyed **epistemology**, **metaphysics**, and **philosophy of science** to underwrite renewed **natural theology**. Unlike some streams of **Reformed epistemology**, which clear a rational-permissive space for **proper basicality** of **theism**, Moreland seeks rational compulsion through cumulative case arguments: **cosmological**, **teleological**, **moral**, **historical**, and especially the argument from **consciousness**. He regards **science** as a partner discipline that supplies data but never the ultimate norms of **metaphysical** or **theological** judgment, rejecting the category mistake of **scientism** that would deauthorize **metaphysics**, **ethics**, or **theology**.

Beyond polemics, **Love Your God with All Your Mind** 1997 and **Kingdom Triangle** 2007 express Moreland’s epistemic burden for the church: cultivating **intellectual discipleship**, renewing **spiritual formation**, and restoring confidence in the **supernatural**. He proposes that a church schooled in **analytic clarity** and trained in **spiritual disciplines** can recover its witness in a culture dominated by **technological rationality** and **therapeutic individualism**. This pastoral inflection does not abandon **natural theology**; it embeds it within a wider **sapiential** vision that treats knowledge as participation in the divine *ordo sapientiae*.

#### 6. Ethics, human dignity, and the imago Dei
Moreland’s philosophical anthropology flows into **ethics** and public theology. In **Body & Soul** 2000 and related essays, he contends that **human dignity** and **intrinsic value** depend on a robust **imago Dei** grounded in the existence of a **soul** as bearer of **substantial form** and **powers**. He argues that secular accounts of **personhood** tied to **functional capacities** undermine the protection of the vulnerable, while **substance dualism** provides a stable ground for **continuity of identity** across **embryonic**, **disabled**, and **end-of-life** conditions. His defense of **libertarian freedom** positions the moral agent as capable of originating actions via **agent causation**, a view that he claims is presupposed by **moral responsibility** and by the existential realities of **repentance** and **virtue formation**.

The link between **imago Dei** and **rational powers** fuels his critique of **naturalism** in **The Recalcitrant Imago Dei** 2009. There he assembles a suite of phenomena that refuse domestication by **physicalist** explanation: **propositional content**, **modal knowledge**, **irreducible normativity**, and the first-person perspective of **selves**. These data points, he argues, cohere far better with **theism** than with any form of **emergent materialism**. Theologically, Moreland’s anthropology supports doctrines of **resurrection** and **sanctification** by securing the **soul** as a persisting subject of **grace** who participates in the life of **God** and is transformed in **virtue** and **knowledge**.

#### 7. Divine action, miracles, and the supernatural
Moreland’s critique of **scientism** opens conceptual space for robust **divine action** and **miracles**. He challenges the deistic drift that treats the **laws of nature** as closed under **physical causal closure**, arguing instead for a metaphysics of **causal powers** where both **creaturely agents** and the **divine agent** can exercise **downward causation** without violating lawlikeness. His epistemology of **miracle** emphasizes the public criteria of **signs**, **testimony**, and **background theism**, drawing on **Bayesian** reasoning where helpful but refusing to reduce **miracles** to anomalies in data sets. In **Kingdom Triangle** 2007, he calls for a church that expects the **kingdom’s** inbreaking through **prayer**, **healing**, and **deliverance**, integrating **charismatic** expectation with **analytic discernment**.

This approach extends to the coherence of **petitionary prayer** and **providence** under **agent causation**. Because agents can originate causal chains, **petitionary prayer** is not extraneous to a mechanistic world but participates in the web of **secondary causes** within a theistically anchored **teleology**. Moreland’s case is thus not only defensive against **naturalist vetoes** but constructive in articulating a metaphysical ecology where **God**, **souls**, and **nature** interact in an ordered, purposive cosmos under the wise governance of the **Logos**.

#### 8. Church, culture, and the intellectual life
A characteristic contribution of Moreland is the convergence of **analytic clarity** with a call for ecclesial renewal in **intellectual discipleship**. In **Love Your God with All Your Mind** 1997, he diagnoses the anti-intellectualism of evangelical subculture and prescribes the cultivation of **intellectual virtues**, **habituation**, and the recovery of **Christian scholarship** across the disciplines. The book’s argument dovetails with his university work in forming cohorts of **Christian philosophers** who could engage **public universities** with confidence in **natural theology** and **metaphysical realism**. Theologically, this is an outworking of the **imago Dei** as rational and moral, a human vocation to know and love God through the **mind** ordered to truth.

Culturally, his opposition to **scientism** is not a rejection of **science** but a re-situating of science within a broader **theistic horizon** that respects **metaphysics**, **ethics**, and **aesthetics** as modes of knowing. He frequently contrasts **technological pragmatism** with a thicker **sapiential** way of life, commended in **Kingdom Triangle**, where the life of **the Spirit**, the life of **the mind**, and the life of **service** intersect. The apologetic upshot is that the plausibility of **theism** is as much a function of embodied communities of **truthfulness** as of syllogisms, though he never relinquishes the latter’s necessity in a culture catechized by **naturalism**.

#### 9. Interlocutors, developments, and ongoing debates
Moreland’s arguments have generated ongoing debate with **physicalists** and **emergentists**. Engaging **Jaegwon Kim**, he argues that **agent causation** escapes the problem of **causal exclusion** by locating causal origination in the **substance** rather than in event-level supervenience relations. He disputes **nonreductive physicalism** for collapsing under the weight of either **epiphenomenalism** or low-grade **reduction**, pressing that genuine **mental causation** requires souls with **causal powers**. Against **David Chalmers’s** property dualism, Moreland insists on **substance dualism** to secure the unity of **consciousness** and the persistence of the **self**. In metaphysics, his measured realism about **universals** has been questioned by **nominalists** who worry about ontological extravagance, and by **Platonists** who think **immanent universals** cannot support mathematical and modal discourse; Moreland replies by appealing to **divine conceptualism** and the structured powers of **natures**.

Within theology, his handling of **abstract objects** and **divine aseity** participates in a broader debate with **William Lane Craig**, **Greg Welty**, and others over **God and abstracta**. Moreland’s impulse is consistent: protect **aseity** without sacrificing the metaphysical furniture needed for **science**, **logic**, and **morality**. Finally, in the space of **origins**, his defense of **intelligent design** keeps alive a conversation often muted within theistic evolution circles, arguing that design inferences are compatible with rigorous **philosophy of science** and do not entail a God-of-the-gaps. The throughline is a consistent rejection of **scientism** and a constructive **natural theology** that showcases **imago Dei** realities recalcitrant to **naturalism**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Moreland offers significant gifts and also invites principled critique. Positively, his dismantling of **scientism**, defense of the **imago Dei**, and clarity on **universals**, **mind**, and **moral realism** strengthen the noetic confidence of the church and align with classical **Reformed** affirmations of the world’s **intelligibility** under the **Logos**. His arguments from **consciousness** and against **naturalism** provide potent *ad hominem* pressure on rival worldviews, and his insistence on **intellectual discipleship** resonates with the **Reformed** vocation to love God with the **mind**. Yet methodologically his **moderate foundationalism** and appeal to putatively neutral **public reason** sit uneasily with **covenantal epistemology** as articulated by **Van Til** and in **WTS** traditions, where all reasoning is conducted *coram Deo* and the **sensus divinitatis** and **Scripture’s self-attestation** supply the principium of knowledge. Moreland’s **libertarian free will** and **agent causation** also conflict with **Reformed compatibilism** and thick accounts of **providence**, suggesting alternative models of responsibility grounded in **character causation** and **desire’s** moral governance under **divine sovereignty**. Finally, his use of **immanent universals** and debates about **abstract objects** can be aligned with **divine simplicity** and **aseity** but require careful calibration to avoid construing **God** as one being among others with properties in a shared genus; a classical **actus purus** and **Calvins autotheos** are better anchors here. A Reformed alternative would retain Moreland’s anti-**scientism**, his **soul** realism, and his **imago Dei** ethics, while repositioning **natural theology** within a **covenantal** framework that begins with **revelation**, employs **transcendental** critique of **autonomous reason**, and grounds moral agency in **compatibilist freedom** within the **covenant of grace**.
