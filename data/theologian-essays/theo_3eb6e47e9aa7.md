### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, paideia, and ascetic method
Gregory of Nazianzus, born near Nazianzus in Arianzus around 329 and dying in 390, emerged as the Cappadocian most steeped in classical **paideia** while most insistent on monastic **askesis** as the school of **theologia**. Educated in **Caesarea**, **Alexandria**, and **Athens**, he forged lifelong ties with **Basil of Caesarea** and contended intellectually with **Julian the Apostate** in the student milieu. After a near-fatal storm at sea, he embraced baptism around 358 and joined **Basil** in Pontic retreat, crafting a method that binds purity of heart to clarity of speech. The early **Oration 2 On His Flight to Pontus** in 362 reveals his ambivalence about ecclesial office and his conviction that speaking of **God** is governed by **apophatic theology** and the ascetical posture of silence before the ineffable. From the outset Gregory articulates the distinction of *theologia* and *oikonomia*, grounding doctrinal confession in the scriptural economy while guarding the divine **ousia** from rash definition. His method fuses the **rhetorical art** of the Second Sophistic with **evangelical humility**, a combination that will shape his **Theological Orations** and his pastoral battles against **Arian** and **Eunomian** reductions.

#### 2. Controversy as school: against Eunomius and the Anomoeans
The sharpest edge of Gregory’s method is honed against **Eunomius**, the Anomoean who equated divine essence with unbegottenness and claimed its exhaustive knowability. Gregory denies that the divine **ousia** is an object of conceptual mastery, insisting on **apophatic reserve** and the asymptotic approach of the purified intellect. He advances the Cappadocian formulation of **one ousia three hypostases**, affirming **divine simplicity** while distinguishing real relations by relational properties. Against the Eunomian reification of one predicate, he argues that the names of God arise as **epinoiai**, conceptual ascriptions drawn from the divine **energeiai** ad extra, never a capture of the essence *ad intra*. The **monarchy of the Father** is reinterpreted as personal **aitia**, an eternal causal primacy that does not entail subordinationism. This causal language secures **eternal generation** of the Son and **eternal procession** of the Spirit without lapsing into temporal dependency, preserving both the unity of **power** and **will** and the irreducible hypostatic distinctions.

#### 3. The Theological Orations as doctrinal architecture
Delivered in Constantinople at the Anastasia church from 379 to 380, the five **Theological Orations 27–31** provide Gregory’s most concentrated doctrinal synthesis. **Oration 27 On the Theologian and on the Right Way to Speak of God** legislates the ethos of **theologia**, forbidding frivolous dialectic and calling for purity, prayer, and scriptural discipline. **Oration 28 On the Existence and Knowledge of God** develops **apophatic theology**, arguing that while God is known from effects and names as **Goodness**, **Being**, and **Power**, the divine **ousia** remains beyond every concept. **Orations 29 and 30 On the Son** defend the Son’s **homoousios** with the Father, locating generation in the timeless divine life, not in the will or in the economy, and refusing the Arian trade of **divine simplicity** for an impoverished monad. **Oration 31 On the Holy Spirit** presents the decisive claim that the Spirit is God, worthy of the same **latreia**, sharing the same **nature**, and distinguished by procession from the Father. Throughout, Gregory appeals to the rule of **doxology** and the canon of **Scripture**, arguing that liturgical practice implies metaphysical truth, and that the shape of the **oikonomia** interprets the **theologia** without dissolving it.

#### 4. Christology against Apollinaris and the soteriological axiom
Gregory’s **Epistle 101 To Cledonius** in 382 offers his lapidary Christological axiom, often summarized as what is not assumed is not healed. Against **Apollinaris of Laodicea**, Gregory insists that the incarnate Lord assumes a complete human nature, including a rational **nous**, lest salvation fail to reach the seat of human deliberation and desire. The unity of the person is hypostatic, not a merger of essences nor a mere moral conjunction, thus anticipating the **Chalcedonian** pattern later codified as without confusion, change, division, or separation. Gregory regularly confesses **Mary as Theotokos**, which secures the identity of the one person of the Son through the incarnational descent. Soteriology for Gregory is not only juridical but participatory, ordered toward **theosis** as transformative communion by grace. Yet the path of **theosis** is cruciform, mediated by the historical **oikonomia** of the Word who suffers impassibly according to the divine nature and passibly according to the human, a careful balance that protects **divine impassibility** while doing justice to the Gospel’s passion narratives.

#### 5. Pneumatology, economy of revelation, and worship’s canon
Gregory’s pneumatology in **Oration 31** prosecutes a twofold strategy against the **Pneumatomachians**. First, he insists on the **economy of revelation**, where the Old Testament proclaims the Father openly and the Son more dimly, the New Testament reveals the Son clearly and introduces the Spirit, and the Church now openly confesses the Spirit’s full deity. Second, he applies the **doxological rule** that what is joined to the Father and the Son in **baptismal** and **eucharistic** worship must be consubstantial with them. Although he sometimes exercises terminological economy by not pressing the word **homoousios** for the Spirit in every venue, the doctrinal content is unambiguous, culminating in his defense of the Spirit’s **power**, **sanctifying work**, and **inseparable operations** with Father and Son. He specifies that the Spirit **proceeds from the Father**, while also affirming the Spirit’s mission through the Son, a formula that established later Eastern tradition and set terms for the **Council of Constantinople 381**.

#### 6. Pastoral leadership and conciliar drama
Summoned by a small Nicene community in 379 and later supported by **Theodosius I**, Gregory served as the confessor-bishop at the Anastasia, reclaiming Constantinople from **Arian** dominance through preaching, sacramental ministry, and the constructive assault of the **Theological Orations**. Installed as bishop of the capital in 380, he presided at the **Council of Constantinople 381** until controversy over his non-canonical translation from Sasima forced his resignation. His **Oration 42 On His Farewell** yields a portrait of pastoral realism and a principled refusal to sacrifice catholic peace to personal power. Returning to Arianzus, he continued to shape the Church through **letters**, **poetry**, and **funeral orations**, notably **Oration 43 On Basil** in 381, a masterwork that both venerates **Basil of Caesarea** and cements Cappadocian doctrinal consensus on **one ousia three hypostases**. His episcopal career compressed into a few tempestuous years leaves a legacy where rhetorical mastery serves **orthodoxy**, not vanity, and where ascetic **phronesis** interprets the heart of **dogma**.

#### 7. Metaphysical grammar and the Trinity’s inner life
Gregory’s trinitarian grammar interweaves **monarchy of the Father**, **eternal generation**, and **eternal procession** into a coherent account that avoids both modalism and subordinationism. He affirms a single **nature** and **operation** in God, with distinct hypostatic properties that are identified by relations of origin. The Father is **unbegotten**, the Son is **begotten**, the Spirit **proceeds**, and these are not temporal acts but eternal, ineffable modes of being. The unity of **will** and **energy** secures **inseparable operations**, so that every divine act toward the world is from the Father, through the Son, in the Spirit, a rule that preserves both unity and taxis. While Gregory does not articulate a formal doctrine of **perichoresis**, his rich language of mutual indwelling and coinherence anticipates the later term. He also develops a careful account of **divine names**, refusing the **Eunomian** identification of essence with a single predicate and instead reading names as responsive to the self-disclosure of God in **Scripture** and the **oikonomia**, a stance that secures **divine simplicity** while honoring revelation’s pluriform idiom.

#### 8. Scripture, exegesis, and the ascetical-liturgical horizon
For Gregory, doctrinal truth is formed within **Scripture**, **liturgy**, and **askesis**. His exegesis blends literal confession of the incarnation with figural and **allegorical** readings that make doctrinal and moral claims converge. The **Orations on Theophany and Baptism 38–40** teach a rich sacramental theology where **baptism** is both cleansing and illuminative, entry into the Triune name and pledge of **theosis**. Homilies deploy classical **rhetoric** yet subordinate eloquence to **orthodoxy**, using antithesis and paradox to mark the boundaries of **Christological** and **Trinitarian** confession. Ascetical prescriptions aim at **apatheia** rightly understood, not the stifling of love but its purification, so that the mind’s **theoria** may behold God by grace. Theology thus becomes doxological science, with **doxology** both testing and teaching **dogma**, and the ecclesial calendar itself becoming a catechesis in **theologia–oikonomia**.

#### 9. Transmission, reception, and the Theologos
In the East Gregory is uniquely titled **Theologos**, a name otherwise reserved for **John the Evangelist**, signifying his definitive voice on the **Trinity**. His influence on **Gregory of Nyssa**, **John of Damascus**, and later Byzantine homiletics is marked by the authority of the **Theological Orations** and the **Cledonius** letters in adjudicating **Apollinarian** and **Pneumatomachian** disputes. In the West, though less cited than **Athanasius** or **Augustine**, Gregory’s axiom what is not assumed is not healed undergirds **Chalcedonian** and **post-Chalcedonian** Christology and enters Latin tradition through **Leontius** and later scholastic summaries. Modern retrievals by **Vladimir Lossky**, **John Zizioulas**, and **Lewis Ayres**, as well as close studies by **Christopher Beeley**, underscore Gregory’s synthesis of **apophatic theology**, **monarchy of the Father**, and **inseparable operations**. His **poetry** and **letters** also sustain a tradition of theological aesthetics where **beauty** serves truth, and where **theosis** frames the telos of soteriology as communion rather than mere moral improvement.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
Reformed theology receives Gregory as a crucial architect of **Nicene Trinitarianism** and **Chalcedonian Christology**, embracing his robust **eternal generation**, his defense of the Spirit’s full **deity**, and his crisp distinction of **theologia** and **oikonomia**. His insistence on **inseparable operations** coheres with classical Reformed confessions that ascribe one **will** and **power** to the undivided **Trinity**. Yet two tensions require adjudication. First, Gregory’s **monarchy of the Father** as personal **cause** presses against **Calvins autotheos**, the Reformed accent on the Son’s personal aseity according to the divine nature. A principled Reformed alternative preserves **eternal generation** as a hypostatic relation without construing causality as a metaphysical asymmetry in deity, thereby guarding full **aseity** of the Son while retaining a noncompetitive taxis. Second, Gregory’s strong **apophatic** rhetoric must be disciplined by the Reformed commitment to **covenantally accommodated revelation** in **Scripture**, where the analogical yet sufficient character of biblical language grounds positive dogmatics without speculative overreach. On **theosis**, Reformed theology affirms participatory communion by the **Spirit** through union with **Christ**, but construes it within **forensic justification** and **sanctification**, eschewing any suggestion of ontological deification. In sum, a Westminster catholicity gratefully receives Gregory’s **Trinitarian** and **Christological** grammar, reframes his **monarchy** and **apophaticism** within a covenantal epistemology, and deploys his doxological canon as a chastening ally to Word-governed **confession**.
