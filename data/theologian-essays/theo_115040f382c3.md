### ESSAY
Ronald Cole-Turner is a leading contemporary voice in **theology and science**, distinguished by his determination to bring Christian doctrinal reasoning into articulate contact with **genetics**, **human evolution**, and the prospect of **technological enhancement**. Working primarily within mainline Protestant circles at **Pittsburgh Theological Seminary** from the late 1980s onward, he has aimed to make the church fluent in the idioms of the Human Genome Project, **CRISPR**, and **transhumanism**, without abandoning the **gospel’s eschatological horizon**. His signature move is to read the **imago Dei** teleologically, as vocation and destiny fulfilled in Christ, and to explore how emerging biotechnologies might be received within a theology shaped by **theosis**, **pneumatology**, and **hope**. Against both technophilic triumphalism and bioconservative paralysis, his theology proposes a discriminating openness grounded in **Christological** and **ecclesial** criteria.

Formationally, Cole-Turner’s intellectual home is the ecumenical tradition of **science-and-theology** pioneered by **Ian Barbour** and developed by figures such as **John Polkinghorne** and **Nancey Murphy**. From **Barbour’s typology** he inherits a suspicion of crude conflict models and a search for critical integration. From **Polkinghorne** he appropriates a sense of creation’s rationality and sacramental depth. From **Murphy** and the neurosciences he receives **nonreductive physicalism**, an account of the human person that avoids dualistic substance ontology without collapsing the mind into materialism. In the background stands **Teilhard de Chardin’s** evolutionary eschatology and **Jürgen Moltmann’s** theology of **hope**, both of which encourage a historical, forward-leaning construal of **imago Dei** and **salvation**. His institutional work with centers such as the **Center for Theological Inquiry** further situates him as a mediator between ecclesial theology and scientific research communities.

Methodologically, Cole-Turner practices a constructive **public theology** that treats the settled deliverances of natural science as providentially indicative for doctrinal construction, while seeking to norm them by **Christological eschatology** and the work of the **Holy Spirit**. Scripture and tradition remain authoritative but are read with hermeneutical attention to genre, **mythic** and figurative registers, and the canonical centering of **Christ**. He resists **foundationalism** and simple **natural theology**, preferring a dialogical approach in which science adjusts the plausibility structures of theology, even as theology offers norming **teleology** and **ethics** for science. His keywords include **evolutionary providence** rather than strict interventionism, **theosis** as participation and transformation rather than ontological conflation, and **sacramental realism** toward the material order in which grace works through creaturely means. Where many theologians of technology fall into dystopia or utopia, Cole-Turner insists on an eschatologically chastened, ecclesially located discernment of **enhancement** as potential participation in God’s redemptive **telos**.

The early program comes into focus in **The New Genesis: Theology and the Genetic Revolution (1993)**, written at the dawn of comprehensive mapping of the human genome. There Cole-Turner frames **genetics** as a theological invitation, not a threat, pushing beyond reactive bioethics toward constructive anthropology and eschatology. He addresses **germline modification**, **gene therapy**, and **reproductive technologies**, arguing that an ethic of **imago Dei** must weigh human dignity, relationality, and the common good rather than absolutizing nature-as-given. He contrasts this with the bioconservative caution of **Leon Kass** and the giftedness argument of **Michael Sandel**, acknowledging their insights about gratitude and humility while refusing to make creaturely limits sacrosanct. Emerging questions about **human cloning** received fuller treatment in the edited collection **Human Cloning: Religious Responses (1997)**, where he convened Jewish, Christian, and Muslim voices. A decade later, **Design and Destiny: Jewish and Christian Perspectives on Human Germline Modification (2008)** broadened the dialogue, clarifying both prudential constraints and theologically grounded openness to some forms of inherited change, provided that justice, solidarity, and compassion for the vulnerable remain nonnegotiable.

The conceptual heart of his constructive project appears in **Transhumanism and Transcendence (2011)**, an edited volume gathering theologians and philosophers to assess the claims of **Nick Bostrom**, **Ray Kurzweil**, and other proponents of **transhumanism**. Cole-Turner refuses to accept the movement’s anthropological and soteriological assumptions, especially its **techno-utopianism** and thin account of suffering and death. Yet he hears in transhumanist desire a secularized echo of **theosis** and **sanctification**. He argues that Christian faith should not surrender the language of transformation and even exceeding natural limits, because **resurrection**, **glorification**, and **conformity to Christ** entail a genuine surpassing of present human capacities. The crucial doctrinal distinctions are **grace over technique**, **ecclesial formation over consumer choice**, **resurrection of the body** over disembodied uploading, and **eschatological gift** over immanent mastery. In short, he counters **transhumanism** with **transcendence**, widening ethics into theology proper and soteriology.

A parallel stream in Cole-Turner’s work addresses **human origins**, especially the fate of **Adam** within modern evolutionary science. In **The End of Adam and Eve: Theology and the Science of Human Origins (2016)**, he canvasses **paleoanthropology**, **population genetics**, and the emergence of symbolic culture to argue that humanity descends from a population, not a single ancestral couple. He reads the early chapters of **Genesis** as authoritative **mythic theology** whose truth does not depend on a literal first pair. The implication is a reframed hamartiology: **original sin** names the universal, transgenerational entanglement of agency, desire, and environment within an evolutionary history, not a biologically inherited guilt from a solitary **federal head**. He proposes that **Romans 5** and the Adam-Christ typology are theologically potent as corporate representation and narrative contrast, not as genetic transmission. Cole-Turner thus aims to preserve the universality of sin and the singularity of **Christ’s atoning work** while decoupling both from a premodern anthropology that conflicts with contemporary science.

Cole-Turner’s anthropology coheres around **imago Dei** as vocation and destiny, informed by **nonreductive physicalism** and **pneumatology**. Drawing on **Nancey Murphy** and cognitive neuroscience, he declines substance dualism while defending the integrity of subjectivity, moral agency, and worshipful relation to God. The **soul** is not a detachable substance but the person-in-relation sustained by God, whose eschatological future rests in **resurrection** rather than natural immortality. The **Spirit** is present and active in evolutionary history, luring creation toward its *telos* in Christ, a proposal resonant with **Moltmann’s** panentheistic themes yet chastened by ecclesial practices of discernment. Within this framework, human creativity, including technological work, participates in God’s **providence** as creaturely secondary causality. The key is to avoid any confusion of **deification** with technicized self-transcendence, keeping **theosis** tied to **union with Christ**, **sanctification**, and **love**.

These doctrinal coordinates yield a distinctive ethic for **biotechnology and enhancement**. Cole-Turner distinguishes **therapy** from **enhancement** but treats the line as porous, urging attention to the concrete goods of healing, relationality, and social justice. He evaluates **CRISPR** and germline intervention by criteria of safety, solidarity, and protection of the poor from technological marginalization, while refusing to enshrine current natural limits as moral absolutes. Practices that express **neighbor love**, heal suffering, and expand access to flourishing may be welcomed as signs of **kingdom-oriented** mercy. Practices driven by consumerism, status competition, and **body-escapist** fantasies are to be rejected as idolatrous. He resists both the **bioliberal** confidence that technique can secure meaning and the **bioconservative** posture that sacralizes nature-as-is, urging instead a doxological reading of technology as, at best, a parable of divine generosity, and, at worst, a mirror of human **hubris**.

Cole-Turner’s ecclesial compass points consistently toward the practices of **worship**, **sacrament**, and **catechesis** as the church’s primary response to technological change. He insists that pastoral ministry must become literate in **genetics**, **AI**, and **reproductive medicine**, not to baptize them indiscriminately but to guide discernment, support families, and witness to **hope** beyond technique. In ecumenical forums, including volumes like **Christian Perspectives on Transhumanism and the Church (2018)**, he facilitates dialogue among theologians, scientists, and lay leaders so that the church’s voice in the public square is both truthful and informed. He has occasionally explored horizons like **astrobiology** and the possibility of extraterrestrial life as further occasions to deepen Christian **creation doctrine** and humility. Throughout, the note he sounds is sober expectancy: God’s future is not the product of laboratories, yet laboratory work may, under grace, be taken up as a penultimate sign of the **new creation**.

As a theologian of origins, Cole-Turner also presses hermeneutical questions about **Scripture** and **tradition**. He favors canonical, Christ-centered interpretation that receives **Genesis** as theological narrative, letting the **incarnation**, **cross**, and **resurrection** disclose the meaning of creation and fall. He argues that the scandal of particularity in **Christ** should not be yoked to a narrow anthropological particularity in a single historical **Adam**, but rearticulated as the universality of Christ’s saving reach within a world God has always governed through evolutionary means. In dialogue with **Augustine** and **Calvin**, he affirms the profundity of sin while locating its universality in the empirical ubiquity of disordered loves and social structures rather than an inherited ontological defect. The upshot is a soteriology that highlights participation, transformation, and **Spirit-empowered** holiness within communities that embody anticipatory signs of **eschatological** reconciliation.

Critically, Cole-Turner’s engagement with **transhumanism** sharpens Christian talk of **transcendence** and **hope**. He brings into the open the implicit soteriology of modern technology and forces a choice between **eschatological gift** and **technological self-redemption**. His appropriation of **theosis** is deliberately anti-Gnostic and pro-embodiment, locating transformation in **resurrection** rather than digital immortality. He deploys a robust **ecclesiology** to counter consumerist visions of the good life and invokes **justice** to reframe the cost of enhancement. In doing so, he offers pastors and theologians conceptual tools to navigate the flood of promises and fears that attend the biotech century, while keeping **Christology** and **pneumatology** at the doctrinal center.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, the achievement and the tension in Cole-Turner’s project come into sharp relief. Positively, his attention to **creation’s integrity**, **common grace**, and the limits of **technological soteriology** resonates with classical Reformed cautions about idolatry and with a vocation-centered ethic of culture. Yet three fault lines remain. First, his reconfiguration of **Adam** and **original sin** under the pressure of **population genetics** tends to dissolve **federal headship** and the covenantal structure of **Romans 5**, risking a drift from forensic clarity toward therapeutic anthropology. The Reformed alternative maintains a historical **Adam** within a robust doctrine of **special revelation**, integrating scientific findings critically under the primacy of the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**. Second, his method often grants **scientific consensus** a near-regulative role for doctrine, inviting an **immanentized eschatology** in which the **Spirit’s** leading is mapped onto evolutionary process. A Reformed correction emphasizes the **Creator-creature distinction**, the sufficiency and perspicuity of **Scripture**, and the already/not-yet of **redemptive history** that refuses to sacralize historical progress. Third, his selective retrieval of **theosis** as warrant for openness to **enhancement** risks confusing sanctification with capability expansion. Reformed theology would re-anchor transformation in **union with Christ**, **Word and sacrament**, and **Sabbath-shaped** acceptance of creaturely limits, treating technology as a domain of **vocation** under **common grace**, ordered by the moral law and subordinated to **cross-shaped** wisdom rather than to the horizon of engineered uplift. In sum, Cole-Turner’s constructive courage clarifies crucial questions, but a classical Reformed posture would receive his prompts while re-centering **federal theology**, **eschatological reserve**, and **Scripture’s** primacy over technological imaginaries.
