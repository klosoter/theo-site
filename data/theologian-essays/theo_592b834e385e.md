### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and the modern turn
Born in 1768 in Breslau and shaped by **Moravian Pietism** at Niesky and Barby, Friedrich **Schleiermacher** stepped into a modern world unsettled by **Enlightenment rationalism** and reshaped by **Romanticism**. The early pietistic emphasis on **piety as lived Godwardness** furnished his lifelong commitment to **religion as life**, while his studies at **Halle** placed him in the orbit of **Kantian critical philosophy** and the philological sciences. Pastoral work in **Charité Hospital** and **Trinity Church** in Berlin, his role in founding the **University of Berlin** in 1810, and intellectual friendships with the **Berlin Romantics** supplied the cultural setting for his redefinition of **theology**. Schleiermacher did not wage a simple war against **reason**; he undertook a methodological reorientation. He refused both **dogmatic rationalism** and nostalgic **confessionalism**, pursuing a third path in which **religion** is sui generis and **dogmatics** disciplines the church’s **self-consciousness** rather than repeating metaphysical theses. In this setting he forged his celebrated thesis of **feeling of absolute dependence**, a phenomenological center meant to honor **pietas** while engaging **critical modernity**.

#### 2. Religion as feeling and the Romantic protest
With **On Religion: Speeches to Its Cultured Despisers** in 1799, a programmatic tract dedicated to Berlin’s **salon culture**, Schleiermacher declared **religion** neither **metaphysics** nor **morality**, but **Sinn und Geschmack fürs Unendliche**, a sense and taste for the **infinite**. He pressed a Romantic protest against both **deistic natural theology** and **moralism**, insisting that religion discloses a pre-reflective **immediacy** grounded in the subject’s living relation to the **whole**. The oft-cited core, the **feeling of absolute dependence**, names a consciousness of self that is entirely receptive before **God**. This is not sentimentalism, he argued, but the basal stratum of **God-consciousness** beneath conceptual determinations. Doctrine then arises as a second-order articulation of pious **intuition and utterance**, a disciplined speech that follows from religious life. The appeal to **Romantic aesthetics** sharpened his claim that theology must translate **experience of the whole** into communicable form without collapsing into **speculative idealism**. **Spinoza** was recast as a pious monist of the divine whole, **Kant** as a moralist who missed religion’s distinctive sphere, and **Fichte** as a voluntarist who absorbed **God** into the ego.

#### 3. Theological encyclopedia and the university project
In the **Brief Outline of the Study of Theology** 1811, Schleiermacher set out his **theological encyclopedia**, organizing the disciplines as a science internally ordered to the **church**. He distinguished **philosophical theology** that reflects on the essence, **historical theology** that sifts the sources and traditions, and **practical theology** that governs the tasks of **preaching** and **pastoral care**. The anchoring claim was decisive: theology is a **positive science** whose principium is the **Christian community’s piety**, not neutral **rationalism**. The **university** thus trains ministers who serve the **Gemeinde**, and the scholarly labor of **exegesis**, **church history**, and **dogmatics** remains subordinate to the living **confession of the church**. This architecture pursued a modern confessionalism without **scholastic metaphysics**, framing **dogmatics** as a normative account of **church-consciousness**. Such a program was inseparable from his nation-building labors in Berlin, where he helped integrate **philology**, **history**, and **philosophy** into a Protestant humanism in which **theology** retained its integrity among the sciences.

#### 4. The Christian Faith as systematic dogmatics
Schleiermacher’s masterpiece, **The Christian Faith (Der christliche Glaube)** first edition 1821–22 and second edition 1830–31, codifies his method. The work begins not with **God’s essence** but with **piety as God-consciousness** and proceeds by presenting doctrines as determinations of that consciousness within the **redeemed community**. The structure follows the flow of **creation**, **sin**, and **redemption**, ordered by the fundamental determination of **absolute dependence**. A signature feature is his placing of the **doctrine of the Trinity** at the end as a synthetic summary of Christian **God-consciousness** rather than as a speculative **metaphysical** centerpiece. Throughout the **Christian Faith**, dogmatic propositions are justified by their capacity to express and preserve authentic **Christian self-consciousness** and by their place within the **evangelical** rather than the **legal** consciousness. A rigorous internal logic governs the loci, yet the logic is that of **religious self-description** rather than an **analogia entis**. The end result is a systematic work of remarkable coherence, aiming to be both faithful to the **Reformation’s emphasis on grace** and candid about the conditions of **modern consciousness**.

#### 5. Anthropology, sin, and Christology
At the heart of Schleiermacher’s doctrinal innovation stand his accounts of **sin** and **Christology**. **Sin** appears as a universal state of **God-forgetfulness** and fragmentation of the **God-consciousness** that ought to unify the self. He refuses inherited debates about **original guilt** as juridical imputation, preferring a phenomenology of **unfreedom** grounded in communal life. **Christology** then centers on **Jesus** as the human in whom **God-consciousness** is absolutely and permanently dominant. The **Redeemer** possesses the perfect and archetypal **God-consciousness**, and his historical life communicates this consciousness to the **community** through the **Spirit**. Redemption is thus the progressive **reconstitution** of human existence as conscious **dependence on God**, not primarily a change in divine **forensic status**. **Justification** and **regeneration** are reframed as correlates within the same experience of reconciliation, with **forgiveness** integrally bound to new **life in the Spirit**. The distinctive claim is that **Christ’s causality** is personal and historical within the **Gemeinschaft**, avoiding both **docetism** and purely moral exemplarism by positing a real communicative presence of the **Redeemer**.

#### 6. God, creation, providence, and miracle
Schleiermacher’s **doctrine of God** is governed by **absolute dependence** and the methodological ban on speculative **essences**. He affirms both **divine transcendence** and **immanence** in terms of the relation of whole and part, often sounding close to **Spinozan monism** while defending the uniqueness of **God** as the whence of **piety**. **Creation** is relational rather than temporal origination, meaning that all finite being stands in determinate **dependence** upon **God**. **Providence** expresses the same relation as a universal order rather than episodic interventions, and **miracle** is redescribed as an event whose religious value lies in how it intensifies **God-consciousness**. In this idiom **prayer** is intelligible not as causal leverage upon God but as the creature’s conscious participation in **providence**. The **attributes of God** function as rules for piety rather than as metaphysical predicates, and the **Trinity** serves as the final doctrinal summary of the Christian mode of dependence that is given through **Christ** and **Spirit**. This approach attempts to honor classical **monotheism** while disallowing any return to a pre-critical **metaphysics** of divine substance.

#### 7. Scripture, church, sacraments, and hermeneutics
On **Scripture and church**, Schleiermacher advances a consequential thesis. **Scripture** is the normative **witness** to the original **Christian self-consciousness** and bears authority as it mediates the **Redeemer’s** causality within the **church**. The **canon** is thus situated within the life of the **Gemeinde**, which is logically prior as the living subject of faith. He repositions **inspiration** as an attribute of the community’s life with **God**, concentrated paradigmatically in the apostolic age and then discerned through historical **criticism**. The **means of grace** function ecclesially. **Preaching** as *Verkündigung* communicates **Christ’s** God-consciousness to hearers. **Baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** are symbolic acts through which the **community** heightens and extends **God-consciousness**. Schleiermacher’s contributions to **hermeneutics** reinforced this ecclesial-linguistic turn. He united **grammatical** and **psychological interpretation**, arguing that the interpreter reconstructs the author’s **language** and **inner life** in order to understand a text better than its author. His translation of **Plato** and philological rigor shaped a historical sense that fed both modern **biblical criticism** and a new view of **dogmatics** as descriptive of the **church’s faith**.

#### 8. Reception, influence, and the liberal tradition
The effect of **Schleiermacher** on modern **Protestant theology** is difficult to overstate. **Ritschl** and **Harnack** transformed his framework by relocating the center from **feeling** to **value-judgment** and the **kingdom of God**, yet the basic move remained a focus on **religious consciousness** and historical **criticism**. **Troeltsch** radicalized the historical dimension, drawing ethical and cultural conclusions from the historicity of **religion**. **Hegel** offered a metaphysical rival by absorbing **religion** into **absolute spirit**, prompting ongoing disputes about **concept** and **experience**. Twentieth-century **dialectical theology** under **Karl Barth** excoriated the turn to **anthropology** as a reduction of **revelation** to human potentiality, portraying it as the archetype of **liberalism**. Yet **Tillich** retrieved the method of **correlation**, **Bultmann** employed existential categories to demythologize in a different key, and **American pragmatism** and **William James** resonated with the **phenomenology of religious experience**. Late modern figures such as **Pannenberg** and **Moltmann** engaged Schleiermacher critically while restoring **history**, **eschatology**, and **Trinity** to stronger roles. Across these debates, the enduring contribution is the insistence that **dogmatics** be responsive to the **self-understanding** of the **church** within a critical culture.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** vantage, Schleiermacher’s achievement is a brilliant but perilous re-centering of **theology** on **religious self-consciousness**. Positively, his emphasis on **piety as life**, his integration of **philology**, **history**, and **practical theology**, and his commitment to **churchly science** challenge sterile **rationalisms** and nurture pastoral attentiveness to **experience**. Yet decisive tensions remain. First, on **revelation**, he exchanges **Sola Scriptura** and the primacy of **God’s extrinsic Word** for **Scripture as witness** grounded in **church-consciousness**, thereby inverting the **analogia fidei** as a rule of faith by making the **community** the principium rather than **God’s covenantal speech**. Second, on **Christology** and **atonement**, the reduction of **Christ’s person** to perfect **God-consciousness** and of **redemption** to the communication of that consciousness undercuts **two-natures Christology** and the **penal substitution** that grounds **justification** as a forensic act prior to sanctifying participation. Third, on **Trinity** and **doctrine of God**, the relocation of **Trinity** to a concluding summary and the refusal of **divine simplicity** and **immutability** as metaphysical predicates risk collapsing **Creator and creature** within a unifying consciousness. Fourth, on **miracle** and **providence**, the redefinition in terms of intensified piety diminishes **redemptive-historical acts** wherein God binds himself by **covenant** to words and mighty deeds. A Reformed alternative would retrieve **revelation as covenantal Word-act**, construe **Scripture** as inspired and norming canon for the **church**, confess **Christ’s vicarious satisfaction** grounding **justification by faith alone**, and center **Trinity** as the grammar of the whole counsel of **God**, while still welcoming Schleiermacher’s reminders that **dogmatics** serves the **church’s life**, that **experience** must be described and disciplined, and that **practical theology** belongs inside a full **systematic theology**.
