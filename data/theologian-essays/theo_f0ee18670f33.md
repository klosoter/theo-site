### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Christopher R. J. Holmes emerges within a **post-Barthian** yet **classical theist** retrieval, a context shaped by the late **John Webster** and the mid-2000s resurgence of interest in **divine simplicity** and **aseity** against the tide of **open theism** and process thought. Working from New Zealand in the University of Otago, and ordained within the Anglican tradition, Holmes positions himself at the intersection of **Augustinian-Thomist** metaphysics and **Reformed** dogmatic sensibilities. His formative influences include **Augustine’s De Trinitate**, **Aquinas’s Summa Theologiae I**, and a sustained engagement with **Karl Barth**, whose Christological concentration he prizes but whose reservations about the **analogia** tradition he reexamines. Holmes learned from **Webster’s** call for theological theology, namely, an ordered contemplation of **God’s perfection** that begins with God’s **self-communicative holiness** and only then descends to the economy. This method frames his program: Scripture-governed retrieval of the **names of God** and **attributes**, disciplined by analogical predication and oriented to the **processions and missions** of the triune God.

Holmes’s method is neither anti-metaphysical nor speculative; it is a chastened **ressourcement** that reads Scripture with the church’s doctors. He proceeds from the reality of **God as actus purus** and **ipsum esse subsistens** to a careful account of how God’s **perfections** are named and known by creatures. For Holmes, **analogia** is not a bridge of human construction but the grammar of divine condescension in revelation: God, who is simple and immutable, gives names true of himself that we may confess without collapsing into univocity or equivocity. This is the dogmatic posture that allows Holmes to affirm **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** while maintaining a robust account of **missions** in history. The result is a method that retrieves **Aquinas** and **Augustine** in the service of a contemporary, confessional, and ecclesially oriented **Reformed** dogmatics.

#### 2. Early work: attributes and classical theism
Holmes’s first major contribution, **Revisiting the Doctrine of the Divine Attributes** (2007), sets the trajectory for his subsequent labors by defending **classical theism**. In direct conversation with **Karl Barth** and drawing deeply from **Thomas Aquinas**, Holmes recovers the **names of God** as the conceptual matrix for confessing **simplicity**, **immutability**, **impassibility**, and **aseity**. The thesis is clear: the church’s confession of **divine perfection** is not a metaphysical overlay but intrinsic to Scripture’s portrayal of the living God. Holmes argues that biblical predicates of God, when read under the rule of faith, demand the classical grammar of **actus purus** and **simplicity**, lest the economy be projected back onto the **ad intra** life of God in ways that compromise **autotheos** and **immutability**. Against modern anxieties, he insists that **impassibility** safeguards the free and sovereign love of God, while also clarifying how **passion** language functions analogically.

In revisiting the **attributes**, Holmes contests the claim that **Barth** repudiates metaphysics tout court. He recognizes in Barth a profound desire to guard the divine freedom and the primacy of revelation, yet he contends that Barth’s critique of **analogia entis** leaves unresolved tensions in dogmatic predication. Holmes proposes that a chastened **analogia** is necessary for acknowledging the truth and goodness of divine names in Scripture. This positioning places him alongside contemporary allies of **classical theism** such as **Katherine Sonderegger** and, in a different idiom, **Herman Bavinck** and **John Owen**, whose Reformed scholastic commitments already incorporated an analogical, participatory ontology. Holmes thus offers an ecumenically alert, **Reformed-friendly** defense of **simplicity**, setting the stage for his later work on the Trinity and the Christian life.

#### 3. Christology and ethics in the presence of Christ
Holmes’s **Ethics in the Presence of Christ** (2012) shifts focus from metaphysical grammar to moral ontology, yet the **attributes** remain the silent, load-bearing beams. Engaging **Dietrich Bonhoeffer**, he argues that Christian ethics unfolds in the presence of the risen **Christ**, who by the **Holy Spirit** conforms believers to the divine life. This presence is no mere existential encounter; it is the extension of the **missions** that reflect eternal **processions**. Here Holmes develops a concept pair that will become decisive: **participation and imitation**. Participation names the ontological share in the life of God given by the **Spirit** through union with **Christ**, whereas imitation signals the creaturely enactment of virtues through the disciplining force of Scripture and liturgy.

In this frame, Holmes resists moral theologies that bypass **God’s perfection** or that reduce sanctification to activism. Instead, ethics is rendered as the creature’s wise movement within the radiance of **divine goodness**, a goodness whose metaphysical stability is guaranteed by **simplicity** and **immutability**. The upshot is a retrieval of classical **habitus** language for the Christian life without surrendering the primacy of grace. The ecclesial community, under Scripture, becomes the theater of **Christ’s presence**, and the Spirit the agent of the virtues of **faith, hope, and love**, which mirror the divine **perfections** in analogical form.

#### 4. The Holy Spirit: processions and missions
With **The Holy Spirit** (2015) in the New Studies in Dogmatics series, Holmes supplies the pneumatological engine for his earlier ethical claims. Drawing on **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, he identifies the **Spirit** as subsisting **love** and **gift**, whose eternal **procession** grounds his temporal **mission** to sanctify and vivify the church. Holmes employs the classic distinction between *ad intra* and *ad extra* to argue that the Spirit’s mission reveals but does not alter the eternal divine life. This allows him to maintain **impassibility** and **immutability** while still attending to the rich scriptural testimony to the Spirit’s dynamic presence. The Spirit’s sanctifying work is the creaturely participation in the divine **holiness** and **goodness**, and so Holmes’s pneumatology concretizes his metaphysics of **divine perfection**.

The work is marked by careful **dogmatic exegesis**, especially of Johannine and Pauline texts, and by a refusal to sever the **Spirit** from **Christ** or the **Father**. Holmes critiques pneumatological maximalisms that inflate the Spirit’s mission into an independent principle of novelty, thereby threatening **simplicity** and the **Trinitarian taxis**. Instead, he argues for a deep homology between **processions** and **missions**, emphasizing how the Spirit perfects creatures by ordering them to the Son and the Father. The implication is pastoral as well as metaphysical: sanctification is the Spirit’s work of binding us into the triune **goodness**, which is why ecclesial practices of word and sacrament are the theater in which the **Spirit’s mission** is ordinarily manifest.

#### 5. The Lord is Good: Psalter as dogmatics
In **The Lord Is Good: Seeking the God of the Psalter** (2018), Holmes turns to the **Psalms** as a canonical school of naming **God’s perfections**, especially **goodness**. He retrieves **Augustine’s** and **Calvin’s** reading of the Psalter as a compendium of theology and prayer, arguing that **divine goodness** is the central note of Israel’s praise and the church’s doxology. The doctrine of **simplicity** here bears practical fruit: to confess that the Lord is good is to confess that God is identical with his **goodness**, and that all God’s works are expressions of that uncreated perfection. Holmes shows how the Psalms discipline affections and align the **habitus** of believers with the praise befitting **God’s holiness** and **mercy**.

Holmes’s dogmatic reading of the Psalter is an exercise in **analogical predication** under scriptural authority. He insists that the Psalms do not project creaturely virtues onto God but disclose the divine **perfections** that elicit trust and obedience. Thus, the Psalter educates the church in truthful speech about God, safeguarding against both sentimentality and skepticism. For Holmes, the Psalter’s catalog of divine names functions as a grammar for preaching and prayer, anchoring ecclesial life in the **attributes** of God and refusing to make experience the final measure of **divine goodness**. This work underscores his conviction that doctrinal retrieval must be liturgically habitable.

#### 6. A Theology of the Christian Life: participation and imitation
Holmes’s **A Theology of the Christian Life: Imitation and Participation in God** (2019) consolidates his program. He argues that the Christian life is best described by the order of **participation** then **imitation**: creatures first share in God’s life by grace, then enact that share in embodied virtues. The priority reflects the logic of **processions and missions** already articulated: the Spirit grants participation in the Son’s filial relation to the Father, which becomes the ground of creaturely imitation of **divine goodness**. Holmes retrieves **John Owen** on sanctification as the Spirit’s work of mortification and vivification, locating Reformed spiritual theology within an **Augustinian-Thomist** ontology that rejects both Pelagian activism and quietism.

Here **divine simplicity** does not retreat to the attic of theory; it orders moral reason. Because God is simple, holiness is not a property among others but the fullness of God’s **being** and **beauty**. Because God is **immutable**, the promises that bind the Christian life are stable, even as they demand a lifetime of conversion. Holmes resists moral theologies shaped by historicist flux, grounding the **virtues** in the uncreated **goodness** that the Spirit communicates to the church. The result is a constructive proposal in which **Reformed** soteriology, **Aquinas’s** account of infused virtues, and **Augustine’s** pedagogy of love coinhere.

#### 7. Doctrine of God in contemporary debate
Part of Holmes’s significance lies in how he navigates contemporary disputes over **classical theism**. In dialogue with **Katherine Sonderegger** on **simplicity**, he underscores the dogmatic fruitfulness of the unity of God for reading Scripture. His account aligns with the more stringent defenses of **simplicity** and **impassibility** found in contemporary conversation partners like **Thomas Weinandy** and, within the Reformed world, interpreters of **Bavinck** and **Owen**. Yet Holmes’s posture remains exegetical and pastoral, wary of weaponizing metaphysics. He seeks a reconciliation of metaphysical clarity and biblical immediacy, insisting that careful **analogical** speech is the ally of evangelical conviction.

Holmes’s continued engagement with **Barth** is emblematic. He credits Barth’s insistence on **God’s freedom** and the primacy of **revelation**, but he resists the suspicion of **analogia entis** when it withdraws the very grammar needed to confess the **attributes**. Holmes attempts a Barth-friendly retrieval by showing that **missions** do not jeopardize **immutability**, and that election and covenant presuppose rather than construct **divine perfection**. In this he reflects a broader **Reformed** trend that appropriates **Aquinas** through **Bavinck** and **Owen**, pressing beyond false antitheses between metaphysics and gospel.

#### 8. Scripture, contemplation, and ecclesial practice
Throughout his corpus, Holmes’s theological stance is governed by **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi and animated by contemplation. He reads the canon with the grammar of **names**, which fosters a doxological dogmatics oriented to **worship** and **sanctification**. Theological reasoning is a participation in the church’s praise, not merely a description of religious phenomena. The **Psalter** becomes the privileged school for naming **divine goodness**, while the **Gospels** display the **mission of the Son** and **Spirit**. Ecclesial practices of word and sacrament are not addenda to doctrine but its enactment, for the **Spirit’s mission** forms the **habitus** in which doctrinal truth is lived.

Holmes’s recovery of **contemplation** does not abandon the pastoral. His attention to the **virtues** indicates a desire to shape Christian action. By tying imitation to prior **participation**, he avoids moralism and centers the Christian life on God’s **triune perfection**. The doctrine of **simplicity** thus sustains pastoral resolve: God’s undivided love grounds the stability of promises even when creaturely life falters. In this way Holmes invites pastors and theologians to let the **attributes** preach by transposing **divine goodness** into the idiom of prayer, catechesis, and obedience.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and WTS-leaning vantage, Holmes’s retrieval of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** is a welcome strengthening of **autotheos** and of the **archetypal-ectypal** distinction in knowing God. His Scripture-first dogmatics, ordered by **processions and missions**, coheres with covenantal commitments when the economy is seen as the free determination of the simple God. Questions arise where Holmes’s positive use of **analogia** edges toward an affirmation of **analogia entis** broader than classical Reformed reserve. A WTS critique would urge that any natural theology be resolutely subordinated to the covenantal principium of **special revelation**, making **covenant** rather than a generic participation the primary category for creaturely relation to God. Similarly, while Holmes’s **participation and imitation** rightly privilege grace, a Reformed alternative would stress union with Christ in the **covenant of grace** as the architectonic framework within which participation language finds disciplined use. Finally, Holmes’s reliance on **Aquinas** is a strength when tethered to **Scripture** and **confession**, yet vigilance is needed to ensure that the rule of theological predication remains the **self-attestation of Scripture** rather than a metaphysical system. On the whole, Holmes stands as a constructive ally for **classical Reformed orthodoxy**, offering a refined grammar of **divine perfection** that can be cheerfully received, provided its **analogy** and **participation** motifs are consistently normed by **revelation** and **covenant**.
