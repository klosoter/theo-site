### ESSAY
Samuel D. Renihan has emerged as a leading architect of a contemporary retrieval of **Particular Baptist federal theology**, the project often labeled **1689 Federalism**. His work unfolds within the early twenty-first-century resurgence of **confessional Reformed Baptist** identity, where churches and scholars have sought renewed alignment with the **Second London Baptist Confession 1677/1689**. The historical context includes the wider evangelical recalibration around **classical theism** and **covenant theology** as well as Baptist engagement with **biblical theology** movements. In this ferment, Renihan has functioned as a scholarly pastor and a pastoral scholar, consolidating the Baptist past and clarifying its systematic potential through **historical-theological retrieval**, critical engagement with **Westminster federalism**, and close exegesis of **Jeremiah 31** and **Hebrews 8** on the **new covenant**.

Renihan’s method is confessional and scholastic in tone. He self-consciously advances a **Reformed scholastic** idiom for Baptists, employing **substance and administration**, **formal and material causes**, and the *ad intra* or *ad extra* distinction to clarify **covenantal relations**. This approach is not antiquarian. His adoption of **classical theism** and the confessional attributes of God found in **LBCF 2** aims at doctrinal stability. The small volume **God Without Passions: A Primer** 2015 provides a concentrated defense of **divine impassibility**, **immutability**, and **simplicity**, identifying the doctrine as catholic and Reformed, and arguing that pastoral health depends on the church’s confidence in a God whose **aseity** and **pure actuality** safeguard the gospel. In each area he links dogmatics to exegesis, insisting that the **Creator-creature distinction** underwrites both **covenant theology** and **classical theism**.

The principal historical contribution in **From Shadow to Substance: The Federal Theology of the English Particular Baptists (1642–1704)** 2018 argues that seventeenth-century **Particular Baptists** did not merely excise **infant baptism** from **Presbyterian** systems but reconstructed a coherent alternative covenantal architecture. Through close study of **Nehemiah Coxe**, **Benjamin Keach**, **Hercules Collins**, and others, Renihan contends that early Baptists differentiated between the **Abrahamic**, **Mosaic**, and **Davidic** covenants as typological instruments and the **new covenant** as the formal **covenant of grace**. Here the anchor categories are **typology and substance** and the scholastic distinction of **substance and accidents**. The earlier covenants offered real promises of Christ yet functioned as **shadows** framed by earthly blessings, national polity, and law-guardianship, while the **new covenant** delivers the **substance** in Christ with spiritual efficacy, forgiveness, and an unbreakable internalization of the law.

The constructive popularization of this thesis appears in **The Mystery of Christ, His Covenant, and His Kingdom** 2019. Renihan maps a canonical storyline in which **creation** entails an original **covenant of works** with Adam, confirmed by the presence of the **tree of life**. The fall entails the inception of the **covenant of redemption** as the eternal ground of the **covenant of grace**, a pactum among the divine persons by which the Son undertakes to be **mediator** and head of a new humanity. The historical covenants from **Noah** to **David** are then read as developing the typological **kingdom of Israel**, a **sacral polity** designed to prefigure Christ. Central to this account is an emphatic reading of **Jeremiah 31** and **Hebrews 8** on **new covenant exclusivity**: new covenant membership is coextensive with regeneration, the forgiveness of sins, and the internal law. On this basis Renihan defends **regenerate church membership**, **credobaptism**, and a **closed or careful communion** ethos as intrinsic to covenant form, not as merely prudential Baptist distinctives.

A corollary of this federal structure is Renihan’s handling of the **Abrahamic covenant**. Against **Westminster federalism**, which treats Abraham as the covenant of grace administered to believers and their seed, Renihan argues that **Genesis 12–17** promises Christ and supplies a typological national framework through **circumcision** as a carnal and genealogical sign. He deploys **Galatians 3–4** to differentiate **Abrahamic promise** to Christ and to the nations from the **Sinaitic law** as a guardian and from the national constitution of Israel. The sign of **baptism** therefore is not a continuity of circumcision but an ordinance of the **new covenant**, which, because it is the **covenant of grace in substance**, admits only those who profess and credibly evidence union with **Christ**. Here Renihan appeals to **John Owen** on the **new covenant** as new in efficacy, not merely in administration, to buttress a Particular Baptist conclusion from within **Reformed orthodoxy**.

Renihan’s approach to the **Mosaic covenant** exhibits a cautious alignment with strands of **republication**. While he distinguishes sharply between the **covenant of works** and the **covenant of grace**, he contends that the **Sinai covenant** included a distinct law-covenant layer that secured Israel’s retention of the land by works performed according to statute. This supports his account of **Israel as typological kingdom** standing over against the **church as new covenant kingdom**. He draws here on **Meredith Kline** at points, yet he resists Kline’s presbyterian conclusion about the **Abrahamic covenant** and infant inclusion. The result is a synthesis in which the Mosaic economy is thoroughly **pedagogical**, **typological**, and national, oriented to **Christ** while not being the **covenant of grace** formally considered. The **Davidic covenant** likewise is a royal-typological vector that terminates in the **Messiah’s** enthronement, yet does not itself convey the saving benefits promised in **Jeremiah 31** to its members.

Beyond covenant theology, Renihan’s dogmatic retrieval extends to Christology and creed. In **Crux, Mors, Inferi** 2020 he assembles a doctrinal and historical case for the **descent of Christ to the dead**, reading the **Apostles Creed** in a catholic and Reformed key. He canvasses **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformation** sources, including **Aquinas**, **Ursinus**, and strands within the **English Reformed** tradition, to argue that Christ truly underwent the state of death and descended to the realm of the dead, proclaiming victory and applying redemption to the righteous departed, without any postmortem suffering. This work exemplifies Renihan’s broader pattern: retrieve **classical catholicity**, demonstrate **confessional continuity** within Baptist sources, and articulate pastoral implications for **preaching**, **catechesis**, and **worship**.

Methodologically, Renihan balances **historical theology** and **exegesis** with **systematic coherence**. His use of **substance and administration** functions not as mere scholastic ornamentation but as a tool to prevent equivocation when speaking of the **covenant of grace** across epochs. He insists that the **formal cause** of membership in the **new covenant** is union with **Christ** by the **Spirit**, hence regenerate; that the **material cause** of the old economy’s ordinances lay in typological ceremonies; and that the **final cause** of the old covenants was to serve **Christ** and secure a historical stage for his advent. This logic underwrites his ecclesiology: the **keys of the kingdom** belong to a congregation of the regenerate, where **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** signify and seal present grace to believers, not merely a probabilistic inclusion in a mixed body. Here he retrieves the careful **discipline** and **congregational polity** of early **Particular Baptists**, making ecclesial practice an implication of covenantal form.

Renihan’s corpus engages contemporary Baptist alternatives as well. He sympathetically yet critically addresses **Progressive Covenantalism** as developed by **Gentry and Wellum**, appreciating its attention to biblical-theological storyline and the newness of the **new covenant**, while warning against an underdeveloped account of **law-gospel** and classical **covenant theology** in scholastic terms. He contends that Baptist identity flourishes best where **classical theism**, **definite atonement**, **effectual calling**, and **federal headship** are structured by a robust **pactum salutis** and a carefully distinguished **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**. The retrieval of **Nehemiah Coxe** and **Benjamin Keach** thus is not merely historical but programmatic, positioning the modern Baptist to share in the broader **Reformed** household while maintaining a distinctly **Baptist** account of **church** and **sacrament**.

The pastoral stakes of Renihan’s project are clear. A stable **doctrine of God** through **divine impassibility** grounds assurance; a clear **covenant theology** organizes the canon and catechesis; a regenerate **church membership** shapes missions, discipline, and worship. In sermons and essays he connects **Hebrews** and **Jeremiah** to the practical questions of **baptism**, **membership vows**, and **the Supper**, insisting that the **promissory oath** of God in the **new covenant** is the church’s charter. The kingdom Christ mediates is not geopolitical Israel but the **church catholic**, gathered by the **Spirit** through the preached **word** and sealed by ordinances that follow faith.

In sum, the enduring thesis of Samuel D. Renihan is that **Particular Baptist federalism** is a coherent, catholic, and robustly **Reformed** alternative within the Reformation tradition, one that makes the **new covenant** the formal **covenant of grace**, sees **Israel** as typological, and locates **baptism** and **the Supper** within a regenerate ecclesiology. He couples this with a commitment to **classical theism**, defending **impassibility** and **immutability** as non-negotiable for confessional orthodoxy. By anchoring his work in **seventeenth-century** Baptist sources and **Reformed scholastic** categories, he provides a map for contemporary Baptists seeking dogmatic clarity and historical rootedness.

The Reformed and Westminster Seminary evaluation turns on several principled contrasts. On **revelation and covenant**, Renihan’s stress on **new covenant exclusivity** secures soteriological efficacy but tends to narrow the unity of the **covenant of grace** as confessed in **Westminster federalism**, which affirms one covenant under various administrations with real, though external, participation by infants. On **Abrahamic continuity**, his typological reading clarifies Israel’s national form yet risks eclipsing the redemptive substance signified to the patriarchs and their seed, which Westminster construes as genuine covenantal inclusion with differential internalization. On **church and sacrament**, his **regenerate membership** and **credobaptism** coherently follow from his premises, though a Westminster alternative would appeal to the **external-internal** distinction and **means of grace** to account for a mixed body ordered to nurture covenant children. On **Sinai and republication**, his alignment with a works principle at the national level converges with **Klinean** insights even as it invites further precision on law-gospel without flattening Mosaic graciousness. Positively, his robust **classical theism** retrieval is a shared gain, and his deployment of **Owen** and the **pactum salutis** reflects deep commonality. A Westminster alternative would maintain the **one covenant, multiple administrations** model to preserve historical unity, while affirming much of Renihan’s **typology**, **Christocentrism**, and **divine impassibility** within a catholic Reformed frame.
