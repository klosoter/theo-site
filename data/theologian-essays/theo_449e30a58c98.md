### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the turn to Heilsgeschichte
Oscar Cullmann, born in 1902 in Strasbourg and educated amid the theological upheavals of early twentieth-century Europe, forged a distinctive approach within the broad current of **Neo-Orthodox and Dialectical Theology** by insisting that Christian truth is irreducibly historical. Teaching first at **Strasbourg** from the early 1930s and then at **Basel** after 1945, he became a leading New Testament scholar whose central thesis is captured in the keyword **Heilsgeschichte**, salvation history. Against the timeless idealism of older **liberal Protestantism** and the existential reduction proposed by **Rudolf Bultmann**, Cullmann asserted in **Christ and Time** 1946 that the **kerygma** derives its authority from God’s once-for-all acts, climaxing in **Jesus Christ**, the midpoint of time. The signature eschatological schema already and not yet, often illustrated with the **D-Day and V-Day** contrast inherited from wartime experience, marks the present as a decisive but incomplete victory, uniting **historical events** with the church’s ongoing **hope of the Parousia**.

Cullmann’s intellectual formation took shape in the matrix of Strasbourg’s philological rigor, Basel’s Barthian ferment, and the ecumenical aspirations of the **World Council of Churches**. He cultivated a disciplined historical method, learned from the best of **historical-critical exegesis**, yet resisted its rationalist domestications. His neo-orthodox setting, framed by **Karl Barth’s** divine self-revelation and Bultmann’s existential hermeneutics, set the problem: how to honor the **Word of God** as event without dissolving the event into timeless myth or inner decision. Cullmann’s answer was a **linear temporality** ordered by God’s promissory initiatives, a biblical view of **time** that runs from creation through promise to fulfillment. The insistence that biblical truth unfolds in time, rather than over against it, is the backbone of his hermeneutic and the hallmark of his contribution to twentieth-century theology.

#### 2. Method: between dialectic and demythologizing
Cullmann’s method can be summarized as a principled **Heilsgeschichte** that rejects both **historicist relativism** and **existential dehistoricization**. He criticizes **Bultmann’s demythologizing** for severing the **kerygma** from the narratival reality of the **cross and resurrection**, while also chiding an unqualified **Barthian dialectic** when it appears to dislocate revelation from concrete temporal sequence. Instead of the **analogia entis**, and distinct from a purely dialectical **analogia fidei**, Cullmann operates with an implicit **analogia historiae**: the analogy between God’s acts across the canonical narrative that binds promise to fulfillment. This logic constrains exegesis to trace typological continuities grounded in event, Abraham to Christ, Exodus to Cross, **Passover to Eucharist**, while refusing to collapse history into bare chronicle or reduce doctrine to timeless metaphysics.

The crucial epistemic stance is that the **apostolic witness** is normed by the events it attests, and the **tradition** stream, *paradosis*, transmits and interprets the event without inventing it. Cullmann contributed to the postwar debate collected in **Kerygma and Myth**, insisting that the **New Testament proclamation** rests on real acts of God in space and time. Consequently, historical-critical tools are welcomed as servants of **canonical history**, not as masters that adjudicate what God can do. One reads the **New Testament** with an ear for the unfolding of the **two ages**, *aiōn houtos* and *aiōn mellōn*, and a conviction that Christ’s resurrection inaugurated the **eschatological new creation** while leaving the old age in retreat but not yet abolished.

#### 3. Christ and Time: linear eschatology and the midpoint of history
In **Christ and Time** 1946, English 1951, Cullmann presents his classic mapping of biblical time. Against cyclic or timeless conceptions derived from **Hellenistic philosophy**, he argues for a finite, linear storyline anchored by Christ as **die Mitte der Zeit**, the midpoint of time. Before Christ lies the epoch of promise, after Christ the epoch of fulfillment, both comprehended under the **already and the not yet**. This temporal grammar informs the entire **New Testament**: the kingdom has come, **Satan is bound**, and yet the **church** still prays, Come, Lord Jesus. The famous wartime analogy, **D-Day** as decisive invasion and **V-Day** as final victory, communicates the logic that the resurrection has determined the outcome, while the church suffers and witnesses in the interval between triumph secured and triumph manifested.

Cullmann’s eschatology refuses to construe salvation as a flight into **timeless immortality**. Instead, the reality of the **resurrection of the dead** grounds Christian hope for creation renewed. The bridge between the time of promise and the time of fulfillment is not metaphysics but **narrative fulfillment**, promise-keeping in history by the covenant God of Israel. The result is a coherent reading of **Scripture** that ties prophetic expectation, **messianic identity**, and ecclesial mission to a unified temporal horizon, bringing clarity to the **two-ages schema** that deeply influenced postwar biblical theology.

#### 4. Titles of Christ and the shape of New Testament faith
In **The Christology of the New Testament** 1957 German, 1959 English, Cullmann proceeds by a historical and lexical analysis of **Christological titles** rather than by dogmatic deductions. He treats **Kyrios**, **Son of Man**, **Servant**, **Messiah**, and **Son of God** as salvation-historical designations whose meaning is forged by Christ’s career, especially **crucifixion and resurrection**. The insistence is that New Testament Christology is primarily **functional and historical**, oriented to what God has done in Christ, rather than speculatively **ontological** in a Hellenistic sense. Cullmann does not deny later doctrinal developments, **homoousios** and **Chalcedon**, but he translates their necessity back into the categories of promise and fulfillment, arguing that metaphysical language arose as a protective fence around the **historical confession** Jesus is Lord.

This approach re-centers exegesis on the **apostolic proclamation** and the communal worship that crystallizes the church’s memory. The title **Kyrios** marks the confession of Jesus’ sovereignty in the sphere of history and is inseparable from the Easter event. The **Son of Man** sayings, tied to Danielic visions, signal the eschatological authority that frames the already and not yet. Cullmann thus supplies a method for doctrinal retrieval that is both **biblically disciplined** and conceptually careful, though always tethered to the movement of **Heilsgeschichte** rather than to timeless axioms.

#### 5. Sacraments, worship, and the historicity of the church
Cullmann’s sacramental and ecclesiological studies, notably **Baptism in the New Testament** 1950 and **Early Christian Worship** 1953, extend his salvation-historical method to the life of the church. Baptism is interpreted through **Romans 6** as real participation in **Christ’s death and resurrection**, a decisive transfer from the old age into the new, yet without **magical ex opere** mechanics. The **Eucharist** is *anamnesis*, remembrance that actualizes the once-for-all event by Spirit-wrought proclamation, binding the gathered church to the **Passover-Exodus** trajectory fulfilled in the **Last Supper**. The sacraments are thus time-shaped signs, locating believers within the already and not yet.

On order and unity, **Peter: Disciple, Apostle, Martyr** 1952 argues that Peter’s role is historical and foundational for unity but does not entail a **monarchical episcopate** as a perpetual juridical office. Cullmann’s nuanced exegesis undermines simplistic claims of **papal supremacy**, while preserving a robust sense of **apostolicity** as normed by witness to Christ. In **The State in the New Testament** 1956 he treats political authority as penultimate under the lordship of **Christ the Kyrios**, affirming a limited **Romans 13** vocation while recognizing the eschatological relativizing of all earthly powers in light of the coming **kingdom**.

#### 6. Death, intermediate state, and resurrection hope
Cullmann’s widely discussed tract **Immortality of the Soul or Resurrection of the Dead?** 1958 crystallizes his critique of a Greek-influenced **dualism**. He contends that the **biblical hope** is not the soul’s intrinsic immortality but the **resurrection of the body** by the God who raises the dead. The intermediate state is acknowledged but not absolutized, a provisional being-with-Christ that awaits the consummation. By reintegrating anthropology into **Heilsgeschichte**, Cullmann resists detemporalized conceptions of salvation and aligns death, judgment, and life eternal with the two-ages tension characteristic of **Pauline eschatology**.

This insistence reshapes Christian piety and pastoral theology. Prayer and worship in the early church, another focus of Cullmann’s essays, are practices that situate believers within the **eschatological now** of the Spirit and the **not yet** of the final resurrection. The Christian ethic flows from belonging to the **new creation** while walking as pilgrims through the old, a stance that recalls his **D-Day and V-Day** analogy and preserves moral urgency without eschatological panic.

#### 7. Tradition, canon, and ecumenical engagement
Cullmann consistently argues that **tradition as paradosis** is both binding and dynamic, a Spirit-guided remembering of the **Christ-event** that produced the **canon**. He opposed theories that detach the **apostolic kerygma** from the real history of Jesus, and he worried that critical methods could unwittingly enthrone the scholar over the witnesses. Yet he did not retreat to fundamentalist polemics. His ecumenical labors with the **World Council of Churches** and as an observer at **Vatican II** in the 1960s sought to retrieve the common core of **apostolic faith** by returning to the **New Testament** as the normative record of God’s saving acts. The result was a distinctive combination of historical sobriety and ecumenical charity, uniting **exegetical rigor** with the pursuit of visible unity under the **Kyrios**.

In dialogue with **Karl Barth**, Cullmann warmly embraced the primacy of revelation while insisting that revelation is historically mediated through Israel and the church. In debate with **Rudolf Bultmann**, he affirmed the necessity of **hermeneutics** while refusing to evacuate the **resurrection** into existential self-understanding. His contributions to the **Kerygma and Myth** controversy exemplify his posture, a principled No to the dissolution of history into myth and an equally principled Yes to critical tools that illuminate the text’s salvation-historical claims.

#### 8. Synthesis in Salvation in History
The later collection **Salvation in History** 1965 German, 1967 English gathers lectures and essays that synthesize Cullmann’s project. Here, the **unity of Scripture** is framed by God’s purposive action from **creation to consummation**, with **Christ the midpoint**. The church’s confession is situated in the stream of **Heilsgeschichte**, its sacraments are signs that insert persons into the eschatological horizon, and its mission is participation in the spread of the **kingdom’s firstfruits** while awaiting the **Parousia**. Cullmann reaffirms his core claim that **doctrine**, **liturgy**, and **ethics** derive their sense from the history they narrate and enact, not from speculative systems or cultural ideals.

Throughout, he capitalizes on rigorous **philology**, an acute sense of **Second Temple Judaism**, and an unwavering concern that Christian theology be accountable to **apostolic witness** as history-bearing testimony. Even where he grants development from New Testament to **Nicaea and Chalcedon**, he insists that dogma must be a faithful safeguard of the **historical confession** rather than a replacement of it. The trajectory of his oeuvre thus forms a coherent whole: Christ as temporal center, church as eschatological community, hope as resurrection, Scripture as salvation history.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Cullmann’s contributions command gratitude and careful critique. Positively, his **Heilsgeschichte** resonates with **redemptive-historical exegesis**, his **two-ages** framework strengthens **covenant history**, his prioritizing of **resurrection** over **immortality of the soul** aligns with **creational eschatology**, and his denial of a juridical **papal primacy** supports **apostolicity** without Roman claims. His functional focus on **Kyrios-Christology** and his insistence that sacraments are tethered to the once-for-all event also cohere with **means-of-grace** theology when guarded from sacramentalism. Yet tensions remain. First, his historical-critical posture rarely yields a robust **doctrine of Scripture** marked by **organic inspiration** and **inerrancy**, risking the subordination of **revelation** to scholarly adjudication. Second, his preference for functional over ontological **Christology** can sound muted about **homoousios**, **divine simplicity**, and **immutability**, which classical Reformed orthodoxy prizes as guarding the gospel’s stability. Third, his sacramental account at points suggests stronger **efficacy** language than Reformed **federal theology** would endorse, though he avoids ex opere claims. A constructive Reformed alternative would retain his **salvation-historical** and **already and not yet** insights while rooting them in a confessedly authoritative **canon**, a clear **covenant of grace** architecture, and a doxological metaphysic in which the **triune God** is both Lord of history and self-identical in perfection. In that synthesis, Cullmann’s legacy continues as a vital ally in biblical theology, corrected and deepened by classical **Reformed dogmatics**.
