### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Albert Borgmann, born in 1937 in Freiburg im Breisgau, entered adult life within the ruins and reconstruction of postwar Germany, where the question of modern technology had a distinct gravity. The intellectual air was laden with **Heidegger’s analysis of technology** as *Gestell*, and the university culture carried an ethos of phenomenological description and ethical seriousness. Borgmann studied philosophy and literature in Germany before immigrating to the United States in 1970, taking up a long teaching career at the University of Montana. The topography of the American West gave him both a laboratory and a liturgy. Montana’s mountains and hearths appear throughout his work as emblems of **focal things and practices** that gather people into patterns of attention and discipline. His method is a blend of **phenomenology** and **American pragmatism**, with an Aristotelian regard for the virtues and forms of life. He calls his style **deictic discourse**, speech that points, names, and lets realities show themselves, rather than reducing them to systems. In this, Borgmann stands near **Heidegger**, but where Heidegger leans toward ontological destiny, Borgmann insists on the human capacity for reform through concrete practices. His orientation is normatively charged, issuing an invitation to the **good life** within ordinary households and parishes.

#### 2. The device paradigm as the core diagnosis
Borgmann’s signature concept, the **device paradigm**, introduced programmatically in **Technology and the Character of Contemporary Life** in 1984, names the cultural logic by which modern technology promises liberation and comfort by delivering commodities while disengaging us from the burdens of skill and the textures of place. In the device configuration, the commodity is made available instantaneously while the machinery is rendered opaque and distant. Central heating exemplifies the paradigm. Warmth is provided on demand, while the fire, ash, wood, tools, and the communal circle around the hearth are displaced. The paradigm yields liberation from drudgery, yet it also produces **disengagement and commodification**, a thinning of occasion and a drift toward anonymous consumption. Borgmann resists both technophilia and technophobia. He argues that modern technology is not a collection of neutral tools but a patterned way of revealing the world, analogous to **Heidegger’s enframing**, yet not fate. His philosophical wager is that culture can authorize and sustain **focal practices** that gather us into richer engagement without abolishing devices. The device paradigm is thus both descriptive and normative, a diagnosis of late modernity’s ordering of means and ends, and a summons to reorder ends through disciplined practices that resist the sovereignty of availability.

#### 3. Focal things, commanding reality, and deictic speech
Against the device drift, Borgmann advances **focal things and practices**, a phrase that crystallizes his ethics. Focal things are realities with gravity that command respect and invite skill and intimacy, such as the hearth, the table, the violin, wilderness, and the long-distance run. Focal practices are the repeated, communal engagements that gather us around these things, involving the virtues of patience, risk, gratitude, and attentiveness. He speaks of **commanding reality**, the weight of what calls us out of distraction and into allegiance. The idiom of **deictic discourse** is crucial. It is a language that points to a woodstove, a river at dawn, the bread and wine at a table, helping us see them as more than utilities, as forms that bind us to the world and to one another. The theological resonance appears early. For Borgmann, **liturgy** is the paradigmatic focal practice that integrates body, time, and community before God. The act of gathering, singing, reading, eating, and resting on the Lord’s Day contrasts starkly with the ceaseless flow of commodities and entertainment. His account is not merely aesthetic. It is moral and metaphysical. Focal practice reveals an order of the good that resists the fragmentation of **commodified availability** and calls us into embodied delight and obligation.

#### 4. Information and the thinning of reality
In **Holding On to Reality** in 1999, Borgmann extends his analysis to the ecology of information. He distinguishes **natural information**, the signs that the world bears of itself, like tree rings or constellations; **cultural information**, the humanly crafted inscriptions that guide action and understanding, like musical scores and maps; and **technological information**, the engineered signals that simulate, network, and abstract. Technological information is not evil. It extends power and knowledge. Yet when unmoored from natural and cultural anchors, it enables a realm of **hyperreality** where signs proliferate without reference, replacing engagement with portrayal. This is a further intensity of the **device paradigm**, in which the commodity is not only delivered but becomes symbolic spectacle, as in virtual communities and digital entertainment. The result is a crisis of attention and formation. The promise of access to everything dissolves into a distracted self without deep ties. Borgmann’s normative proposal is to reintegrate technological information with **focal practices** that keep signs accountable to the world. Maps should lead to trails, and music files should lead to instruments and ensembles. He thus articulates an ethic of information directed toward reality, community, and skill.

#### 5. Postmodernity and the tone of reform
**Crossing the Postmodern Divide** in 1992 addresses late twentieth-century culture’s skeptical irony and fragmentation. Borgmann acknowledges **postmodern** insights into the constructedness of meaning and the dangers of totalizing narratives. Yet he refuses the slide into cynicism. His reformist program is to retrieve **deictic discourse** and **focal practices** as a way of speaking and living that counters both the sovereignty of devices and the anemia of postmodern irony. He urges a tone of chastened confidence rather than nostalgia. The point is not to abolish **technological modernity**, but to cultivate islands of gathered meaning that reconnoiter the possibility of a humane center. Here he echoes **Alasdair MacIntyre’s** recovery of practices and traditions, while insisting that the American landscape and its civic possibilities permit concrete renewal in schools, homes, and congregations. His style is diagnostic but pastoral, a philosopher pointing and inviting rather than legislating, an ethicist whose authority is the authority of examples that disclose a better order.

#### 6. Ethics, citizenship, and institutional supports
The ethical horizon widens in **Real American Ethics** in 2006. Borgmann reasserts the importance of **virtue** within liberal democracies, contending that a good life is possible when citizens order their daily practices around **focal things** and support them through public institutions. He is not a Luddite. He grants that **devices** relieve suffering and extend opportunity. Yet he contends that flourishing joins personal discipline to communal scaffolding. Schools should teach skill and attention rather than mere acquisition of information. Urban design should favor local spaces that invite gathering. Public discourse should honor **Sabbath-like rest**, not only for religious minorities but as civic wisdom. Policy cannot manufacture focal practices, but it can cease subsidizing their displacement by the unbounded convenience of the market. Borgmann’s ethic is neither libertarian nor technocratic. He proposes a **civic humanism** that dignifies the home, the parish, the trailhead, and the concert hall as places where shared goods are learned and loved. This broadens his reach beyond philosophy of technology into practical ethics, keeping the **device paradigm** central while specifying means of cultural encouragement.

#### 7. Christianity amid the culture of technology
In **Power Failure: Christianity in the Culture of Technology** in 2003, Borgmann addresses the church directly. The gospel confronts the empire of devices not with prohibition but with **focal grace**. He argues that **Word and sacrament** are focal things that command allegiance, train patience, and gather a people. The **Eucharist** is the chief counterpractice to technological commodification, not because it is premodern, but because it orders desire to a concrete table, a community, a cross, and a promise. Christians should keep **Sabbath**, resist the total availability of work and entertainment, and take up shared disciplines of hospitality, music, care for the poor, and stewardship of place. Borgmann criticizes churches that baptize the **device paradigm** by turning worship into spiritual entertainment and preaching into religious information. He commends liturgy that bears weight, patterned time that interrupts availability, and spiritual disciplines that depend on the material world as gift. This is a Catholic and catholic proposal. It honors **sacramentality**, while inviting evangelicals and Reformed to recognize that the faith is irreducibly embodied and communal. The aim is not cultural withdrawal but the formation of a people whose practices render the gospel publicly visible amid the empire of devices.

#### 8. Dialogues and distinctions within the philosophy of technology
Borgmann’s project stands in a complex conversation with peers. With **Heidegger**, he shares the theme that technology is a mode of revealing beyond mere instruments, yet he rejects fatalism and insists on human agency through **focal practices**. With **Jacques Ellul**, he agrees that **technique** tends to colonize every domain, yet he declines Ellul’s Calvinist tone of cultural judgment in favor of a program of reform through liturgical and communal disciplines. With **Andrew Feenberg** and critical theory, Borgmann acknowledges the possibility of **democratic rationalization** of technologies, but he shifts the fulcrum toward the household and parish rather than the factory and the state. With **Don Ihde** and postphenomenology, he shares a descriptive attention to human-technology relations, while insisting on stronger normative claims. With **Alasdair MacIntyre** and **Charles Taylor**, he shares an account of practices, traditions, and social imaginaries, yet insists that the American landscape and the ecology of information impose distinctive pressures that require **deictic discourse** and focal countermeasures. The cumulative result is an approach that is simultaneously philosophical, ethical, and quasi-theological, a rare clarity in a field often divided between description and prophecy.

#### 9. Themes, developments, and theological uptake
Across his corpus, Borgmann develops a coherent map. The **device paradigm** diagnoses how availability and commodification displace skill and community. **Focal things and practices** offer a normatively thick response. **Deictic discourse** functions as an epistemic stance that refuses reduction and invites acknowledgment. The **information taxonomy** in **Holding On to Reality** clarifies how signs can either mediate reality or substitute for it. The ethic of **Real American Ethics** locates private virtue within public supports. The ecclesial vision of **Power Failure** integrates Christian liturgy as the archetype of focal engagement. Theological reception has been significant. Protestant ethicists such as **Craig M. Gay** and **Brian Brock** have mined Borgmann’s analysis for the church’s life under modernity, while pastors and writers have appropriated **focal practice** to interpret **Sabbath**, **table fellowship**, and **catechesis**. The resonance with **virtue ethics** and **sacramental realism** has been fruitful for Catholic and Anglican audiences, while evangelicals have found in his critique of **entertainment-shaped worship** an ally for renewal centered on **Word and sacraments** and the local church’s practices. His influence extends into debates on digital media, education, urban design, and environmental stewardship, in each case through the lens of commanding realities that gather us for the good.

#### 10. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
A Reformed evaluation receives Borgmann as a bracing ally and a salutary irritant. On the positive side, his critique of the **device paradigm** aligns with **Reformed doctrines of creation and providence** that insist the world is gift, ordered by God’s law, and good in its particularity. His advocacy of **Sabbath** as a counter to availability resonates with **Westminster’s doctrine of the Christian Sabbath**, which distinguishes holy rest from mere leisure. His insistence on **Word and sacrament** as focal practices fits the **means of grace** and the **regulative principle of worship**, particularly when he contrasts gathered worship with commodified entertainment. His attention to household and parish sits well with **Kuyperian sphere sovereignty** and **covenantal** accounts of social order. Yet tensions emerge. Borgmann’s use of **sacramentality** risks sliding into a **nature-grace** schema that blurs the primacy of **special revelation** in ordering worship. His **deictic discourse** beautifully names creation, but it can understate the noetic effects of sin that **Van Til** highlights in the **antithesis** between covenant obedience and idolatry, especially the idolatry of technique. Borgmann’s focus on local reform may neglect the structural dimensions of power that **Reformed social thought** seeks to assess under the second table of the law. Finally, his optimism about cultural retrieval should be chastened by a more robust **eschatology** in which focal practices are means by which the Spirit conforms the church to Christ under the cross, rather than tokens of an immanent good life. A Reformed alternative would strengthen his summons by indexing focal disciplines to the **covenant of grace**, subjecting technologies to the **moral law**, binding worship to the **Word preached and sacraments administered**, and mobilizing **sphere sovereignty** for institutional critique. Under these clarifications, Borgmann’s insights serve the church as it resists the empire of devices with the liberty of ordered love.
