### TITLE
J. Gresham Machen is the paradigmatic Reformed defender of historic, supernatural Christianity against liberal Protestantism, whose clarity on revelation, doctrine, and the church remains indispensable for confessional Presbyterianism.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- Born 1881 in **Baltimore**, trained in **Princeton** and **German liberal universities**, Machen labored amid the rise of **liberal Protestantism** and the fundamentalist–modernist controversy in the early twentieth century.
- His work unfolds against the background of **higher criticism**, **Darwinian naturalism**, and the transformation of mainline **Presbyterianism** in the United States leading up to 1937.

- Methodologically Machen is a classic **Old Princeton** theologian who weds **confessional Reformed orthodoxy** to rigorous historical and philological scholarship.
- He insists that **Christianity** is a religion founded on public, historical **revelation** attested in propositional truth, not on subjective **experience** or moral sentiment.
- His epistemic stance is essentially **common-sense realist**, assuming the reliability of sense perception and language while stressing the absolute authority of **Scripture**.

- In **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** (1921) he argues that **Pauline Christianity** is rooted in the historical Jesus and Old Testament revelation, not in Hellenistic religious syncretism.
- In **Christianity and Liberalism** (1923) he contends that **liberalism** is not a variety of Christianity but a different religion grounded in naturalism and ethics rather than supernatural grace.
- In **What Is Faith?** (1925) he clarifies that **faith** is trust in Christ based on knowledge of the gospel, rejecting both anti-intellectualism and liberal experientialism.
- In **The Virgin Birth of Christ** (1930) he defends the **incarnation** and the historical reliability of the gospel narratives against higher critical attacks.
- His popular work **The Christian View of Man** (1937, posthumous) presents a thoroughly **Reformed anthropology** in contrast to modern optimistic humanism.

- Machen is seminal for understanding **revelation and Scripture** as objective, inerrant, and historically grounded against modern criticism.
- He is equally important for **Christology and soteriology**, especially the supernatural incarnation, vicarious atonement, and the necessity of doctrinal clarity for salvation.
- His life and writings shape Reformed views of **church and culture**, ecclesiastical separation, and Christian education.
- His battles help define modern **Presbyterian ecclesiology**, including the founding of the **OPC** and **Westminster Seminary**.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to present Machen as a faithful **confessional Presbyterian** whose main lines stand in continuity with **Calvin**, **Hodge**, **Warfield**, **Vos**, and **Van Til**.
- They will also want you to note his occasional **Old Princeton** rationalist overtones and his underdeveloped engagement with **presuppositional** apologetics and broader cultural theology.

- For comparison, link Machen with **Warfield vs. liberal higher critics** like **Harnack**, **Ritschl**, and **Harnack’s What Is Christianity?**.
- Also compare **Machen vs. Barth** on liberalism and revelation, and **Machen vs. Van Til** on apologetic method and common ground.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
J. Gresham **Machen** was born in **Baltimore** in 1881 into a cultured, conservative Southern Presbyterian family deeply shaped by the **Westminster Standards** and the classical education of the nineteenth century. He studied classics and philosophy at **Johns Hopkins**, then theology at **Princeton Seminary**, where he came under the influence of **B. B. Warfield**, **Geerhardus Vos**, and the Old Princeton tradition of confessional Reformed orthodoxy joined to serious historical scholarship. His further study in **Marburg** and **Göttingen**, where he sat under **Wilhelm Herrmann** and encountered **Ritschlian** and broader liberal theology, nearly unsettled his faith. Those German years forced him to wrestle with the claims of **historical criticism**, **Kantian ethics**, and the liberal demythologizing of Scripture, which later gave his polemics both nuance and urgency.

The driving problem of Machen’s theology is the clash between historic, supernatural **Christianity** and modern **liberal Protestantism** in the context of the early twentieth century fundamentalist–modernist controversy. In his classic **Christianity and Liberalism** of 1923, written while he was still at **Princeton**, he contends that liberalism is not Christianity in a different idiom but a wholly different religion grounded in **naturalistic** presuppositions and a moralistic understanding of God and man. For Machen the problem is not simply doctrinal error but an entire worldview that denies the category of the supernatural, empties **Christology** of deity and atonement, and reduces the **church** to a religious-ethical society. His battles over the reorganization of Princeton Seminary and over foreign missions in the **PCUSA**, culminating in his suspension from the ministry and the founding of **Westminster Theological Seminary** in 1929 and the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** in 1936, were all expressions of this core problem: can confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** coexist institutionally with a liberal theology that has abandoned the supernatural gospel.

Thus Machen’s life and theology are animated by a single concern, namely the defense of the historic, doctrinal, supernatural **gospel** as the only Christianity there is, over against a modernity shaped by **Enlightenment rationalism**, **Darwinian evolution**, and an optimistic view of human nature. He believed that the integrity of **Scripture**, the reality of the **incarnation** and **atonement**, and the spiritual independence of the **church** from state and cultural control all stood or fell together. This sense of an all‑encompassing conflict in which revelation, salvation, and the nature of the church are at stake explains both the sharpness and the coherence of his major works.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically Machen stands in the **Old Princeton** line, which sought to combine strict adherence to **confessional Reformed theology** with serious engagement in historical and philological scholarship. Following **Warfield**, he regards **Scripture** as the infallible, inerrant Word of God, given by plenary inspiration, and therefore as the supreme and normative source of all theology. Yet he also insists on the full use of **historical reason**, grammatical exegesis, and engagement with non-Christian scholarship. In **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** of 1921 he does not merely assert against **liberal critics** that Paul’s theology is Christian; he works through the historical data, examines Jewish and Hellenistic backgrounds, and shows that the most plausible historical explanation is that **Paul** was captivated by the historical, risen **Christ** of the New Testament. Scripture, for Machen, is self-authenticating as the Word of God, but its historical trustworthiness can and should be vindicated against critical attacks.

Machen’s understanding of **revelation** is resolutely propositional and historical. In **Christianity and Liberalism** he repeatedly asserts that Christianity is built upon a message, or **gospel**, about what God has objectively done in history in **Christ**. Revelation is not primarily the deepening of religious consciousness, as in **Schleiermacher** and **Ritschl**, but the divine interpretation of redemptive events, especially the incarnation, cross, and resurrection. Those events are known through the inspired **Scriptures**, which communicate truth in ordinary human language that can be understood in the same way as other texts, though with divine authority. Against liberal appeals to religious **experience** as foundational, Machen responds in **What Is Faith?** that experience is not self-interpreting, so Christian experience depends on the prior truth of the Word of God. Experience is a fruit of faith in the Word, not its source.

In terms of **reason** and epistemology, Machen operates with a largely **common-sense realist** stance that is characteristic of Old Princeton. He does not share **Van Til’s** later emphasis on an inescapably presuppositional antithesis at the level of epistemic foundations, though he certainly insists on the antithesis at the level of worldview and theology. He is comfortable arguing that Christian claims are supported by ordinary historical reasoning, as in **The Virgin Birth of Christ**, where he refutes the critical dismissal of the infancy narratives by weighing textual evidence, assessing alleged parallels, and employing arguments that assume shared canons of historical plausibility. There is a tension here with the later Westminster emphasis on the noetic effects of sin and a more thoroughgoing **presuppositionalism**, but Machen himself believed that properly used **reason** is a divine gift that serves, though never rules over, the authority of Scripture.

The **church** and **history** play a significant role in Machen’s method, though he resists any shift of final authority from Scripture to ecclesiastical tradition or historical development. As a convinced **Presbyterian**, he values confessions, especially the **Westminster Confession**, as accurate summaries of biblical teaching and as instruments for guarding the church’s witness. Yet in his battles in the **PCUSA** he distinguishes sharply between a church’s visible structure and the true church which is defined by fidelity to the **gospel**. Historical scholarship is likewise ambivalent for him: he insists in **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** and in his New Testament work that Christianity rests on historical facts, yet he also insists that fallen, liberal scholars often misread those facts because of **anti-supernaturalist** presuppositions. So he affirms both the foundational authority of special revelation and the real, though ministerial, role of historical study, while refusing any Kantian split between faith and history that would separate the Christ of faith from the Jesus of history.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the locus of **revelation and Scripture**, the classic Reformed baseline confesses that the triune God reveals himself by general revelation in creation and conscience and by special revelation inscripturated in the **Old and New Testaments**, which are inspired, inerrant, and sufficient. Machen in continuity with **Warfield** and Old Princeton takes this baseline and applies it polemically to the **modernist** attacks on the Bible’s supernaturalism and historical reliability. In **Christianity and Liberalism** he insists that Christianity stands or falls with the historical truth of its message about Christ, which is given only by the **Scriptures**. He opposes **Adolf Harnack’s** attempt to reduce Christianity to the essence of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man precisely because this move abstracts from the biblical story and its doctrinal content. In **The Virgin Birth of Christ** he defends the infancy narratives of Matthew and Luke as historically credible and doctrinally indispensable, arguing against higher critics like **Harnack** and **Loisy** that the virgin birth is organically tied to the incarnational identity of Christ. While he does not develop a Van Tilian critique of autonomous reason, he clearly sees that a prior naturalistic worldview drives much biblical criticism, so he defends the Bible’s supernatural claims by detailed historical work that presupposes the possibility of miracles and divine speech.

Second, in **Christology and soteriology**, the Reformed confessions affirm the **Chalcedonian** doctrine of one person in two natures and the substitutionary, penal atonement of Christ as the heart of the gospel. Machen’s distinctive contribution is to show in historical debate that these doctrines are not speculative metaphysical accretions but the very lifeblood of apostolic Christianity. In **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** he refutes the thesis that Paul transformed a simple ethical message of Jesus into a Hellenized mystery religion about a dying and rising god. He argues instead that **Paul’s Christology** and soteriology come from the historical Jesus as interpreted by the Old Testament and the risen Lord’s own revelation, so the doctrines of the deity of Christ and vicarious atonement belong to the original Christian message. In **Christianity and Liberalism** he targets liberal theologians who affirm a merely exemplary or moral influence view of Christ’s work, such as those influenced by **Albrecht Ritschl**, and insists that the **cross** is substitutionary and propitiatory. Only if Christ is truly God and has borne the curse of the law in our place can there be salvation. Thus Machen’s polemics underscore that orthodox **Christology** and atonement are not marginal but non-negotiable and stand at the very point where Christianity and liberalism divide.

Third, in the locus of **faith and experience**, the Reformed tradition teaches that saving faith is knowledge, assent, and trust directed to Christ and his promises as revealed in the gospel. Machen’s work **What Is Faith?** is one of his most important contributions because it clarifies this classic Reformed definition against both liberal and fundamentalist distortions. He argues against liberalism that **faith** is not a leap into the dark or a generic trust in an immanent God, but a response to specific truths about Christ’s person and work. There can be no saving faith without doctrinal content, and thus doctrine is not an optional overlay but the very form of faith. At the same time, he opposes certain strands of anti-intellectual **fundamentalism** that treat faith as a bare decision or as psychological certainty detached from serious engagement with Scripture’s meaning. His opponents here range from broader modernist theologians to populist revivalist tendencies. Machen insists that faith involves the whole person, including the intellect, will, and affections, and that true Christian experience is the fruit of believing the truth about the crucified and risen **Christ**. Thus he both upholds and pastorally expounds the Reformed view that faith is both doctrinally informed and personally trusting.

Fourth, in the area of **church, culture, and education**, the Reformed baseline is that the church as the pillar and ground of the truth must maintain the pure preaching of the **Word**, administration of the sacraments, and discipline, while Christians live under the lordship of Christ in every sphere of culture. Machen’s distinctive emphasis is on the spiritual independence of the church from state and cultural control and on the necessity of distinctly Christian education. His ecclesiological stance emerges especially in the controversies over the **PCUSA** Board of Foreign Missions and in his role in founding the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**. He opposed what he saw as the drift of the denomination toward a broad coalitional approach that allowed deniers of the **virgin birth** and other core doctrines to serve as missionaries, arguing that the church must be defined by adherence to the confessional gospel. In his essays on **Christian education**, and implicitly in his founding of **Westminster Seminary** in 1929, he contends that education is never neutral but always shaped by a worldview, so the church must train ministers and laity in institutions explicitly grounded in biblical Christianity rather than in religiously indifferent or liberal environments. His interlocutors here include denominational leaders like **Charles Erdman** and **Henry Van Dusen** who favored institutional broadness and accommodation to cultural trends. Machen’s stance has profoundly shaped later **Reformed** approaches to Christian schooling, seminary education, and the question of separation versus cooperation.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Machen stands consciously in line with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, especially as mediated through **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and the **Westminster Standards**, and as developed at Old Princeton by **Hodge** and **Warfield**. His strong views on inspiration, the centrality of the cross, the necessity of justification by faith alone, and the regulative principle for the church’s message are all straightforwardly confessional. **Herman Bavinck** and **Geerhardus Vos** provide a wider Reformed context that anticipates Machen’s insistence on the organic unity of revelation and redemption in history, as well as his concern to face modern thought without surrendering biblical authority. At Westminster his legacy is received and deepened by **Cornelius Van Til**, who shared Machen’s antithetical stance toward unbelieving thought but radicalized the critique of autonomous reason, arguing that all human knowledge is covenantally conditioned.

A Westminster examiner will however press at least two points of tension. First, Machen’s **Old Princeton** epistemology leans on a relatively uncritical common-sense realism that can obscure the depth of the noetic effects of sin and the extent of worldview antithesis, which Van Til sought to correct. While Machen was no rationalist in the sense of subordinating Scripture to reason, his apologetic posture in works like **The Virgin Birth of Christ** sometimes assumes a greater neutrality of shared historical method than later Westminster theology would allow. Second, Machen’s focus is so polemically aimed at liberalism that he leaves underdeveloped the positive project of a broader **Reformed worldview** theology and a systematic doctrine of culture, areas that figures like **Kuyper**, **Bavinck**, and later **Frame** and **Kline** would fill out. Yet Reformed theologians can learn much from Machen’s clarity that Christianity and liberalism are different religions, from his unwavering defense of historic **orthodoxy** at great personal cost, and from his insistence that doctrine, piety, and ecclesial faithfulness are inseparable. His legacy at **Westminster Seminary** and in the **OPC** remains a touchstone for confessional Presbyterian resistance to both liberal and evangelical dilution.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams certain Machen sentences are safe to use almost verbatim. One may say, for example, that **Christianity and Liberalism** argues that liberalism is not a form of Christianity but a different religion altogether, because it denies the supernatural revelation of God in Christ and in Scripture. It is also safe to state that Machen, as an **Old Princeton** theologian, united strict confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** with rigorous historical and philological scholarship, and that he saw the battle with modernism as a total conflict of worldviews, not a family quarrel within a shared faith. One may affirm plainly that for Machen the heart of Christianity is the substitutionary atonement of the divine **Christ**, historically accomplished on the cross and proclaimed in an inspired, inerrant **Bible**. Examiners will appreciate explicit references to **The Origin of Paul’s Religion**, **What Is Faith?**, and **The Virgin Birth of Christ**, along with the specific thesis each one defends, namely the apostolic roots of **Pauline theology**, the cognitive and trusting nature of faith, and the historical and doctrinal necessity of the virgin birth.

There are also phrases that must be qualified or avoided. One should avoid describing Machen as a **fundamentalist** without explanation, since he himself distinguished his confessional, churchly stance from the more anti-intellectual strands of fundamentalism, even though he cooperated in certain battles. It is important not to say that Machen embraces an **autonomous natural theology** or that he thinks **reason** is neutral. Better to say that he sometimes speaks in ways that sound like common-sense realism, assuming considerable shared ground in historical method, yet his convictions about sin and supernatural revelation essentially align with **Reformed** teaching. One must not suggest that Machen is proto-**Barthian** in his Christocentrism, since he sharply criticizes liberalism and insists on the historical and propositional character of revelation, whereas **Karl Barth** will relativize natural theology and historical evidences in a different way. The phrase that Machen and Barth are doing the same thing must be avoided; instead say they both opposed liberalism but from distinct theological frameworks.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners may exploit include the notion that Machen is simply a culture warrior with no positive theological contribution, or that his only concern was doctrinal precision with little pastoral or experiential concern. You should be ready to point to **What Is Faith?** and **The Christian View of Man** to show his pastoral and anthropological depth. Another misunderstanding is that Machen is merely a backward-looking scholastic who refused to engage modern scholarship. On the contrary, his studies in Germany under **Herrmann** and his detailed works on **Paul** and the virgin birth demonstrate serious and informed interaction with critical scholarship. Finally, students may assume that Machen’s method is identical to **Van Til’s**; you should carefully note that while both are thoroughly Reformed and share an antithetical stance toward unbelief, Van Til develops a more explicit **presuppositional** epistemology that goes beyond Machen’s Old Princeton framework. Being able to position Machen between **Warfield** and **Van Til** will show the committee that you grasp both continuity and development within the Reformed tradition.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective Machen should be affirmed as a paradigmatic defender of **confessional Reformed orthodoxy**, especially in his insistence on the inerrancy of **Scripture**, the supernatural incarnation and virgin birth of Christ, the penal substitutionary atonement, and the necessity of doctrinal clarity for the life and mission of the church, and his courage in founding **Westminster Seminary** and the **OPC** models ecclesial fidelity in the face of apostasy; yet we must also recognize the limitations of his Old Princeton epistemology, which can sound overly confident in shared rational and historical methods and insufficiently articulate about the radical noetic effects of sin that later **Van Tilian** thought will underscore, so when asked where we land we should say that we stand unreservedly with Machen against liberalism, fully embrace his doctrinal commitments and his view of Christianity as a historically grounded, supernatural religion, while also appropriating and extending his project through a more self-conscious presuppositional critique of autonomous reason and a more fully developed Reformed theology of culture.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- J. Gresham **Machen** is the key early twentieth century Reformed Presbyterian who argued that **Christianity and liberalism** are two different religions and fought to preserve historic, supernatural Christianity in church and seminary.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Born 1881 in **Baltimore**, trained at **Princeton Seminary** and in Germany, taught New Testament at Princeton before helping found **Westminster Seminary** in 1929.
- In **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** (1921) and **Christianity and Liberalism** (1923) he defended apostolic **Christology** and the supernatural gospel against liberal Protestant reinterpretations.
- In **What Is Faith?** (1925) and **The Virgin Birth of Christ** (1930) he clarified Reformed **faith** and defended the historical **incarnation**, dying in 1937 after founding the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Machen follows **Old Princeton** in treating **Scripture** as inerrant special revelation while using rigorous historical and philological methods to defend its credibility.
- He insists that **revelation** is propositional and historical, that **experience** must be interpreted by the Word, and that reason is a ministerial tool rather than an autonomous judge.
- His epistemology leans on a **common-sense realist** confidence in shared historical reasoning, which later **Van Tilian** thought will critique and refine.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In **Christianity and Liberalism**, Machen argues that liberalism is a different **religion** because it denies supernatural **revelation**, the deity of Christ, and vicarious atonement.
- In **The Origin of Paul’s Religion**, he contends that **Pauline theology** arises from the historical Jesus and Old Testament revelation, not from Hellenistic mystery cults.
- In **What Is Faith?** he defines saving **faith** as knowledge, assent, and trust in Christ based on the doctrinal content of the gospel, rejecting both liberal experientialism and anti-intellectual fundamentalism.
- In **The Virgin Birth of Christ**, he defends the **virgin birth** as historically credible and theologically necessary for orthodox **Christology**.
- Through his ecclesiastical battles he advances a Reformed view of the **church** as bound to confessional truth and of **Christian education** as necessarily worldview-driven.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press how Machen’s **Old Princeton** use of common-sense realism and shared historical method relates to a more thoroughgoing **presuppositional** epistemology.
- They will probe whether his defense of **Scripture** and miracles adequately accounts for the noetic effects of sin on reason and scholarship.
- They may question the breadth of his positive **theology of culture**, given his focus on polemics against liberalism and on Christian education.
- They will expect clarity that Machen is not merely a generic **fundamentalist** but a confessional **Reformed** Presbyterian with a robust ecclesiology.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Machen vs Harnack** on the essence of Christianity: supernatural doctrinal gospel vs ethical religion of the fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man.
- **Machen vs Ritschl** on faith: doctrinally defined trust in Christ and his atonement vs value-judgments and moral community.
- **Warfield–Machen vs Barth** on revelation and Scripture: inerrant **Bible** as inspired Word vs critical stance toward inerrancy and a more dialectical view of the Word of God.
- **Machen vs Van Til** on apologetics: Old Princeton use of shared historical reason vs explicit **presuppositional** critique of autonomy and emphasis on antithesis.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Machen should be received as a model **Reformed** defender of historic, supernatural Christianity whose doctrinal commitments we fully affirm, while we refine his Old Princeton method with a more self-conscious **Van Tilian** account of reason and revelation.
