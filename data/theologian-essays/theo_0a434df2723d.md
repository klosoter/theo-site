### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Nicholas Wolterstorff, born in 1932 in Minnesota to Dutch Reformed immigrants, came of age where **neo-Calvinist Kuyperianism** met postwar **analytic philosophy**. His early education at **Calvin College** and doctoral work at **Harvard** situated him in a double intellectual inheritance: the **Abraham Kuyper** and **Herman Bavinck** vision of faith-permeated scholarship on the one side, and the clarity and argumentative rigor of **analytic philosophy** on the other. That composite orientation yields his characteristic method in which **Reformed epistemology**, **practice theory**, and a biblically saturated vision of **shalom** are mutually implicative. The influence of **Herman Dooyeweerd** and of the analytic turn to ordinary language and action theory, as in **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, is visible across his corpus. From the beginning, Wolterstorff aims for a public, rational articulation of specifically Christian scholarship in which **control beliefs** derived from the gospel legitimately shape inquiry while remaining accountable to shared standards of argument.

Wolterstorff speaks from and to the Reformed world while inhabiting wider philosophical discourses at **Calvin College** and later at **Yale**, interacting closely with **Alvin Plantinga** and **William Alston**. Yet his voice is distinct within **Reformed epistemology**. Where **Plantinga** centers the notion of **proper basicality** and **warrant**, Wolterstorff thematizes rationality as embedded in social practices of knowing and in the *ordo* of Christian scholarship. The result is a method that resists **evidentialist foundationalism** without collapsing into fideism, an approach that recognizes the **antithesis** of worldviews yet welcomes **common grace**-enabled discourse in the academy. This line is programmatically set forth in **Reason within the Bounds of Religion** 1976, whose impact on generations of Reformed scholars can hardly be overstated.

#### 2. Reason as faith-guided practice
In **Reason within the Bounds of Religion** 1976, revised 1984, Wolterstorff presents his well-known account of **control beliefs** and **data-background beliefs** as regulative for scholarly theorizing. The thesis is Augustinian: the scholar operates *coram Deo*, and faith-formed **control beliefs** morally govern what sorts of theories count as acceptable candidates for a Christian to embrace. Yet the operational rationality remains responsible to the canons of disciplined inquiry and to intersubjective critique. Wolterstorff thus refuses **W. K. Clifford**-style **ethics of belief** that demand evidential parity before assent in every domain, and he contests the aspiration to a view-from-nowhere. He recovers, with **Thomas Reid**, the innocence of trust in faculties like perception and testimony, yet sets this within a **Kuyperian** philosophy of scholarship where each sphere has its creaturely integrity under the rule of Christ.

The language of **practice** is structural in this method. Rationality is located in **social practices of inquiry**, not in isolated Cartesian subjects. This practice orientation foreshadows his later uses of **speech-act theory** in **Divine Discourse** 1995 and his accounts of **art** and **liturgy** as socially enacted. It also anticipates his rehabilitations of **natural rights** and political **justice**, where rights are not metaphysical curiosities but lived claims within ordered communities. The Reformed grammar of **creation-fall-redemption** guides his analyses of academic work and public life, ordered by the eschatological telos of **shalom**.

#### 3. God speaks: Scripture as divine discourse
Wolterstorff’s single most consequential contribution to systematic theology is **Divine Discourse** 1995, an extended application of **speech-act theory** to the doctrine of **revelation** and **Scripture**. Building on **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, he distinguishes **locutions**, **illocutions**, and **perlocutions**, and argues that God performs illocutionary acts in and through human discourse. The heart of the project is the notion of **double-agency discourse**. Human authors utter sentences with determinate content, and God, without dictation and without erasing human history, appropriates those utterances as vehicles of divine promising, commanding, warning, consoling. The result is a crisp account of **inscripturation** that safeguards the full humanity of Scripture while grounding its **normative authority** in divine speech acts.

Within this framework, **authorial intention** is complex. Wolterstorff resists both simple intentionalism and free-floating reader-response; he develops a layered account where the divine speaker can intend more than the human author consciously intended, because **God’s illocutions** are not reducible to human mental states. He thereby undercuts reductive historicist and **expressivist** models that would make the Bible merely a record of religious experience. He also offers a path beyond the impasse between **inerrancy** conceived as atomistic fact-accuracy and **postliberal** cultural-linguistic accounts that underplay divine agency. Without embracing the anti-metaphysical strictures of **George Lindbeck**, Wolterstorff honors the communal practice of reading while insisting that **God addresses** his people by the text. This theology of discourse, moreover, grounds his accounts of **liturgical proclamation**, **prayer as petition**, and the Spirit’s **illumination** as God’s continued perlocutionary work.

#### 4. Liturgy, lament, and the practice of hope
The theological arc that runs from **Divine Discourse** 1995 to **Hearing the Call** 2011 and **The God We Worship** 2015 ties revelation to worship. If God speaks by **Scripture**, the church answers in **liturgy**. Wolterstorff emphasizes that Christian worship is not primarily aesthetic contemplation but a pattern of **address and response**, a covenantal meeting in which **God’s illocutions** judge and console. Hence the importance of the **psalms of lament** for the church’s speech. His deeply personal **Lament for a Son** 1987, written after the death of his son Eric, functions as a kind of counter-theodicy. Rather than offering a theodicy of explanation, Wolterstorff advances a theology of **lament** as faithful protest and hope. The crucial doctrinal point is that **biblical lament** is itself God-licensed discourse within the covenant, an instance of the *lex orandi* that shapes the *lex credendi*.

This liturgical turn sharpens his earlier claims about **practice**. Prayer is a practice in which believers perform God-authorized speech acts that align them with the realities proclaimed in **Scripture**. Lament expresses the already–not yet tension of **eschatological hope**, refusing both stoic resignation and triumphant denial. In this register, Wolterstorff does not construct a systematic **theodicy**; he instead articulates how the communal practices of worship and mutual consolation enact **shalom** amid grief. This is consistent with his modus operandi across topics: identify the practices in which divine and human agency interlock and describe their norms with analytic clarity.

#### 5. Justice, rights, and shalom in public theology
From **Until Justice and Peace Embrace** 1983 to **Justice: Rights and Wrongs** 2008 and **Justice in Love** 2011, Wolterstorff develops a sustained **political theology** centered on **justice as honoring rights** and on **shalom** as multidimensional flourishing. The early work frames the biblical vision of **shalom** not as subjective serenity but as right relationships with God, neighbor, and nonhuman creation. That vision grounds a critique of injustice and calls the church to public witness. He engages **apartheid** and global poverty as concrete sites where the church must act, shaped by **Micah’s** triad of justice, mercy, and humility before God.

The later analytic treatises elaborate the moral structure of **rights**. Against the long analytic resistance to rights-talk, Wolterstorff defends rights as basic normative claims held by persons in virtue of their **worth** conferred by God and displayed in the **imago Dei**. He critiques **utilitarian** and **perfectionist** reductions and evaluates **Rawls** and **Nozick** in turn, finally articulating a **deontic** account in which wronging consists in violating a person’s right. In **Justice in Love** 2011 he argues that **agape** does not subsume or override justice but rather requires honoring rights within the **ordo amoris**. Love is rightly ordered when it upholds the neighbor’s claims; forgiveness, likewise, does not eliminate the moral significance of wrongdoing. The political sequel, **The Mighty and the Almighty** 2012, explores the dynamics of sovereign power and the vocation of the church vis-a-vis the state, again in the key of **rights**, **love**, and **shalom**. Throughout, the Reformed impulses of **creation order**, **common grace**, and **sphere sovereignty** inform his political judgments without collapsing the church into partisan ideologies.

#### 6. Epistemology between Reid and Locke, Plantinga and Alston
Wolterstorff’s epistemological writings supply the scaffolding for both his doctrine of **revelation** and his public philosophy. In **John Locke and the Ethics of Belief** 1996 he interrogates the genealogy of modern **evidentialism**, distinguishing the praiseworthiness of doxastic states from their justificatory structure and challenging the demand for proportioned evidence in all belief formation. In **Thomas Reid and the Story of Epistemology** 2001 he recovers **Reid’s** common-sense realism about perception, memory, and testimony as antidotes to modern skepticism. Though he shares with **Plantinga** the rejection of classical foundationalism and the affirmation that **religious belief can be properly basic**, Wolterstorff’s distinctive emphasis is that rationality is always **practice-situated** and shaped by **social norms** of inquiry. The notion of **doxastic practices** is more explicit in **William Alston**, yet Wolterstorff’s version stresses normative governance by **control beliefs** as a moral and theological responsibility for the believer-scholar.

This epistemic posture underwrites **Divine Discourse** 1995. If divine and human speech acts interpenetrate, then testimony is central to knowing God. The reliability of testimony, in turn, is not a last resort but a basic epistemic source, as **Reid** held. And the believer’s acceptance of **Scripture** as divine discourse is not an irrational leap but the inhabitance of a **community of practice** ordered by God’s promises. The irony is intentional: analytic clarity here serves to give reasons for trusting that which the **Augustinian** tradition had long confessed, namely that the heart is restless until it rests in God’s speaking and that reason finds its order in the **ordo amoris**.

#### 7. Art, culture, and the practices of making
Before his more theological writings, Wolterstorff contributed decisively to the **philosophy of art**. In **Works and Worlds of Art** 1980 and **Art in Action** 1980, and later in **Art Rethought** 2015, he opposes a museum-centered, objectivist aesthetic with a **practice-based** account. Artworks are nodes within social practices that include celebration, protest, devotion, and instruction; their point is not exhausted by inducing aesthetic experience. This reframing dissolves the myth of art’s autonomy and connects it to **worship** and to the life of **shalom**. The Reformed background matters here: the cultural task is not to sacralize art but to receive it as a gift within the **creation mandate** and to evaluate it by norms internal to its diverse practices.

The through-line from aesthetics to liturgy is explicit in later essays collected in **Hearing the Call** 2011. Worship is among the social practices in which making and meaning coinhere. Hymnody, congregational responses, and the proclamation of **Scripture** are all sites of enacted **speech acts**. Hence the regulative questions are practice-internal: What is this practice for, and what counts as excellence within it, given that **God speaks** and we answer? The coherence of Wolterstorff’s oeuvre becomes evident: philosophy of art, **Reformed epistemology**, and theology of Scripture share the grammar of practice and discourse.

#### 8. Interlocutors and lines of debate
Wolterstorff’s constructive proposals are sharpened by sustained dialogue. With **Plantinga** he co-founded **Reformed epistemology**, yet he persistently pressed the social-practice dimension beyond **warrant** to **control beliefs**. With **William Alston** he shared attention to **doxastic practices**, while rejecting **Cliffordian evidentialism** in light of **Reid**. In political philosophy he debates **Rawls** and **Nozick**, arguing that **rights grounded in worth** are irreducible and biblically resonant. In theology, he resists **postliberal** tendencies associated with **George Lindbeck** and **Hans Frei** that, in his judgment, insufficiently account for **God as speaker**. Against some renditions of **Barth’s** revelation-as-event, he insists that **inscripturated discourse** is a fitting medium for divine address. And in ethics he contends with **Anders Nygren’s** sharp agape-eros contrast, arguing in **Justice in Love** 2011 for an **ordo amoris** that includes justice as respect for rights.

At the level of method, Wolterstorff also stands in fruitful tension with **Van Tilian** presuppositionalism. He shares the **antithesis** intuition and the claim that Christian belief rationally governs scholarship, but he is more open to **common-grace** rational collaboration and less inclined to sharply oppositional apologetics. His practice-based rationality enables him to converse widely while maintaining **Reformed** commitments regarding **Scripture**, **creation order**, and the public claims of **justice**. This dialogical posture has made him a bridge figure between the Kuyperian world and the broader guilds of philosophy and theology.

#### 9. Integration and trajectory
Across six decades, Wolterstorff’s corpus coheres around a single theological intuition: the living God addresses his world and summons his people into the **practices** that embody **shalom**. In **Divine Discourse** 1995 he gives that intuition its doctrinal core, anchoring **Scripture** in **speech acts** of God. In **Reason within the Bounds of Religion** 1976 and his epistemological studies he shows how believing scholars can responsibly inhabit their **control beliefs** without abdication of rational standards. In **Until Justice and Peace Embrace** 1983, **Justice: Rights and Wrongs** 2008, and **Justice in Love** 2011 he extends the same logic into the city, arguing that **rights grounded in worth** are the moral grammar of neighbor love under the reign of Christ. In **Lament for a Son** 1987 and **The God We Worship** 2015 he demonstrates how worship, grief, and hope are practices through which divine and human discourse meet. Even the excursions into **aesthetics** in **Art in Action** 1980 and **Art Rethought** 2015 are facets of that integrated vision.

The continuity is not repetition but development. The early emphasis on **control beliefs** gives way to a richer account of **divine discourse**; the early talk of **shalom** matures into precise treatments of **rights** and **love**; the early apologetic against **evidentialism** becomes a positive philosophy of **testimony** and **practice**. Along the way, Wolterstorff never abandons his **Reformed** commitments. He simply translates them, with analytic precision, into concepts that can carry theological freight in contemporary debates about **revelation**, **rationality**, **worship**, and **justice**.

In a concise **Reformed/WTS evaluation**, the strengths are considerable: a robust account of **Scripture as divine discourse** that honors both human authors and **God’s illocutions**; a prudent recovery of **practice-shaped rationality** that resonates with **Calvin’s** faith seeking understanding; and a public theology centered on **shalom** and **justice** that resists both quietism and triumphalism. Yet several tensions remain when measured by classical Reformed orthodoxy. First, the heavy reliance on **rights-talk** can eclipse the thicker covenantal grammar of **law and promise**, **federal headship**, and **lex caritatis** as developed in the Reformed scholastics; recentering **covenant** might avoid liberal individualist inflections while retaining his deontic insights. Second, his accounts of **lament** and suffering, while pastorally exemplary, leave the metaphysics of **divine impassibility** and **providence** underarticulated; a more explicit retrieval of **impassibilitas** as God’s immutable charity could strengthen the theodical horizon of lament. Third, vis-a-vis **Van Til**, Wolterstorff’s optimism about shared rational practices risks underestimating the noetic effects of sin, even while his **control beliefs** move in the right direction; a sharpened **covenant epistemology** could more explicitly tie rational norms to **revelation** and **regeneration**. None of these critiques cancel the achievement. They indicate how Wolterstorff’s analytic labors can be fruitfully deepened by the classical **Reformed** emphases on **covenant**, **providence**, and the **means of grace**, thereby preserving his central gift to the churches: a compelling picture of God who speaks and a people formed to do justice, love mercy, and walk humbly under that address.
