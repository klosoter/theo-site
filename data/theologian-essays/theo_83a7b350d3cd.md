### ESSAY
James J. Buckley emerges within the **post–Vatican II Roman Catholic** landscape as a theologian who wagers that Christian doctrine is best learned and tested within the **practices of the church** rather than primarily in speculative systems. Formed by the climate of **ressourcement retrieval** and the **postliberal turn** in the last quarter of the twentieth century, Buckley’s work unites a Catholic confidence in **tradition and sacramentality** with a Yale-inflected attention to **ecclesial grammar** and the **rule of faith**. His career in the **Anglo-American academy** and especially at Loyola University Maryland enabled sustained ecumenical exchange with **Lutheran** and **Reformed** theologians, evident in his collaboration with **David S. Yeago** and engagement with **Robert W. Jenson** and **George Lindbeck**. The historical context is crucial: the decades after **Vatican II** called for dogmatics that is biblically saturated, patristically framed, and ecclesially situated, and Buckley positioned himself squarely within that nexus, drawing from **Thomas Aquinas** while conversing with modern figures like **Hans Urs von Balthasar** and **Karl Barth**.

If one seeks a concise account of his method, it is **ecclesially located, practice-shaped dogmatics**. Buckley advances the claim that the living **lex orandi, lex credendi** of the church teaches us how to speak of the **Triune God**, not by replacing doctrinal clarity with mere practice, but by showing that doctrine’s grammar is already embedded in **baptism**, **preaching**, and the **Eucharist**. The **regula fidei** functions as a hermeneutical key, ordering exegesis so that Scripture is read *in ecclesia* toward the **confessio Trinitatis**. Without denying metaphysics, he prefers metaphysics that follows the **economy of salvation** and is chastened by **theological interpretation of Scripture**, retrieving **Aquinas’s** teaching on **divine simplicity** and the **names of God** in service of a narrative-shaped, triune **theologia**. In short, knowing God arises within the Spirit-indwelt **habitus** formed by the church’s sacramental and ascetical life, not from a neutral standpoint or autonomous rationality.

The volume **Knowing the Triune God: The Work of the Spirit in the Practices of the Church** (2001), co-edited with **David S. Yeago**, is the programmatic crystallization of this method. The book stages essays that move from **baptismal identity** to **Eucharistic communion**, from **preaching and catechesis** to the **doxological naming of the Trinity**, thereby arguing that the **Holy Spirit** instructs the church in the knowledge of the Father through the Son by concretely shaping communal life. Contributors such as **Robert W. Jenson** and **Ephraim Radner** are not incidental; their presence signals Buckley’s conviction that **trinitarian grammar** is inseparable from ecclesial **practices**. The central wager is epistemic and theological: the **Triune God** becomes known as the community is conformed to Christ’s paschal pattern in the Spirit, and the **regula fidei** arises not external to but within these practices. The essays, including Buckley’s own contributions, insist that **dogmatic loci** are learned as the church performs its **sacramental** and **liturgical** acts, a claim that refuses both historicist reduction and disembodied speculation.

A second anchor of his oeuvre is editorial and pedagogical: **The Blackwell Companion to Catholicism** (2007), co-edited with **Frederick C. Bauerschmidt** and **Trent Pomplun**, maps the contours of contemporary **Catholic theology** by retrieving the **creedal**, **sacramental**, **moral**, and **spiritual** traditions for a new generation. The Companion’s architecture reflects Buckley’s catechetical instincts: creed to cult to conduct, a unified vision where **doctrine**, **liturgy**, and **ethics** are integrally related by the church’s participation in Christ. The work exhibits his commitment to a **sacramental ontology** in which created realities, by grace, participate analogically in the divine life, even as doctrinal grammar remains policed by the **regula fidei**. Together with essays across **Modern Theology** and **Pro Ecclesia**, Buckley’s editorial labors enact his conviction that theology should be done within the **communio** of the church, in conversation with the wider **oikoumene**.

Doctrinally, Buckley’s center is the **Trinity** confessed from the **economy** to the **immanent** life of God without collapsing one into the other. Following **Aquinas**, he safeguards **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**, yet he insists with **patristic ressourcement** that the divine missions are the interpretive key to the processions. The **baptismal formula** and **Eucharistic doxology** provide the grammar of naming the **Father, Son, and Spirit**, so that trinitarian theology is neither an arid metaphysics nor a flat historicism. His **Christology** is classic and Chalcedonian, stressing the **communicatio idiomatum** as the church learns to confess the one person of Christ in the concrete practices of proclamation, catechesis, and sacrament. Soteriologically he holds together **atonement** and **deification**, uniting **satisfaction** and **participation** through the Spirit’s formation of the faithful into Christ’s image. These doctrinal lines converge in a **communion ecclesiology** where the church is the **body of Christ**, constituted by the **Word** proclaimed and the **sacraments** celebrated.

Buckley’s account of **Scripture and tradition** resists both **biblicism** and **historicist skepticism**. He advances **theological exegesis** under the **regula fidei** and the **analogia fidei**, reading the canon with the **fathers** and **councils** to discern the sense of Scripture in service to **dogma**. He appreciates **George Lindbeck’s** **cultural-linguistic** proposal and incorporates its insight that doctrine regulates Christian speech, yet he insists on an explicitly **sacramental** and **pneumatological** density that anchors grammar in the Spirit’s concrete work in **liturgy** and **catechesis**. Here **Aquinas’s** account of **habitus**, **virtue**, and **sacra doctrina** allows Buckley to render the exegesis of Scripture as a Spirit-formed practice that trains the mind and affections for **wisdom**. He deploys the **analogia entis** modestly as an ontological corollary to the **analogia fidei**, never as an independent natural theology but as a way of naming the creature’s graced participation in God.

A notable feature of Buckley’s theology is a strongly **sacramental ontology**. The **Eucharist** is not merely an ecclesial symbol but the real **res et sacramentum** in which the church is drawn into Christ’s self-offering to the Father. **Baptism** effects incorporation into the **paschal mystery**, a reality that provides the template for Christian identity and ethical formation. In this vein Buckley treats **virtue ethics** not as a moral addendum but as a corollary of sacramental participation, joining **Aquinas** and **John Paul II** in presenting **charity** as the form of all the virtues. Because **grace perfects nature** without abolishing it, Christian moral reasoning is trained in the practices that align us with the **triune missions** and send the church into the world for witness.

Buckley’s major interlocutors reveal a bridging disposition. With **Karl Barth**, he shares a relentless orientation to **revelation** and **Christocentric** dogmatics, yet he demurs from Barth’s suspicion of **analogy**, arguing with **Balthasar** and **Ratzinger** that the **analogia entis** as reformed by the gospel secures the gratuity of grace. **Robert W. Jenson’s** contagious insistence that the **Triune God is the living God of the gospel’s narrative** is received appreciatively, though Buckley qualifies Jenson’s language of divine temporality with **Aquinas’s** insistence on **eternity** and **simplicity**. He draws from **Hans Urs von Balthasar** the sense that dogmatics must be doxological and aesthetic, yet tempers this with the **rule of faith** and the ordinary pedagogy of **catechesis**. Within Catholic theology he aligns with **Communio** currents while remaining attentive to **postliberal** grammar, forging a distinctively Catholic yet ecumenically hospitable style.

A central ecclesiological thread in Buckley is that the church is a **learning body**, tutored by the Spirit through **preaching**, **catechesis**, **sacramental discipline**, and **pastoral governance**. The **magisterium** is not an extrinsic authority but the church’s service to the **truth of the gospel** for the sake of communion and mission. This yields a practical theology of formation in which **doctrine**, **liturgy**, and **ethics** are reciprocally interpreting practices. Ecumenically, Buckley argues for convergence at the level of **trinitarian confession** and **sacramental life**, convinced that genuine unity will be found as Christians learn together to confess and live the **regula fidei**. The Spirit’s ministry is to lead the church into all truth, which for Buckley means deeper conformity to Christ’s paschal mystery and more faithful performance of **Word-and-sacrament** stewardship.

Buckley’s posture toward modernity mirrors his sources. He neither retreats into **anti-modern reaction** nor baptizes **liberal autonomy**. Instead, drawing on **Aquinas’s** metaphysical confidence and **Lindbeck’s** linguistic insight, he treats the church as a public with its own **practices of rationality**, its own **habitus** of reading Scripture and forming persons. His epistemic humility is disciplined by the **creed**, his metaphysical realism by the **economy**, and his ecclesial loyalty by the **mission**. The result is a dogmatics that is recognizably Catholic, patristically saturated, and hospitable to Protestant interlocutors who share commitments to **trinitarian orthodoxy**, **classical Christology**, and **scriptural exegesis** under the **rule of faith**.

Reformed and Westminster-Theological Seminary–style evaluation. Buckley’s strengths for Reformed readers are clear: his **trinitarian orthodoxy**, insistence on **Word-and-sacrament ecclesiology**, commitment to **theological exegesis** under the **regula fidei**, and retrieval of **Aquinas** in service of the **gospel economy**. Yet principled tensions remain. First, his appeal to a rehabilitated **analogia entis**, even when tethered to **analogia fidei**, risks diluting a robust **revelation-first** epistemology in which all true speech about God is covenantally normed by **Scripture alone** as the supreme judge of controversies. Second, his **sacramental ontology** and account of **Eucharistic presence** lean toward a strong **sacramental mediation** of grace that Reformed theology would re-describe by the **Word-Spirit** nexus and an emphasis on **spiritual real presence** governed by **union with Christ** rather than by a metaphysics of presence. Third, his **communion ecclesiology** with a positive account of **magisterium** raises concerns vis-a-vis **Christ’s lordship mediated by Scripture** in the gathered assembly under ministerial, not magisterial, authority. Finally, his integration of **atonement** with **deification** is welcome but would be reframed by **justification by faith** as the definitive forensic act that grounds sanctification and participation. Reformed alternatives would retain Buckley’s doxological and ecclesial instincts while pressing a sharper **covenantal** epistemology, a clearer **Scripture-principle**, and a Word-governed account of **sacrament** and **church** within the classic **catholic-Reformed** tradition.
