### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and a Johannine-Nicene posture
Andrew Moody emerges from **contemporary evangelical Australia**, a context marked by a confident biblicism that has increasingly turned toward **classical Trinitarian retrieval**. His formation shows a pronounced gravitational pull toward the **Fourth Gospel** and the **Nicene-Augustinian** grammar of **missions and processions**, set against the backdrop of the 2010s controversies over **Eternal Functional Subordination**. As editorial director and writer within **The Gospel Coalition Australia**, Moody addressed a lay-pastoral readership while insisting on scholarly precision, recovering **inseparable operations** and **eternal generation** as the guardrails of evangelical discourse on **Trinitarian relations**. He reads Scripture canonically but grants **John’s Gospel** interpretive priority for articulating **Christ’s obedience**, **mission**, and the Father-Son- Spirit taxis. The intellectual climate is defined by two pressures: a popular-level appeal to **social Trinitarianism** that risks multiplicity in God, and a reactionary **EFS** that confuses **economic obedience** with **immanent hierarchy**. Moody situates himself as a retrieval theologian who resists both, arguing from **John** that the Son’s obedience is real and saving, yet grounded in **homoousios** and the **eternal generation** of the Son from the Father.

#### 2. Method: Scripture first, tradition as grammar, and theological contemplation as practice
Moody’s method binds **canonical exegesis** to **classical dogmatics** through the unifying idiom of **missions** grounded in **processions**. He takes **Augustine’s De Trinitate** as both a grammar and a spiritual pedagogy, interpreting the **economic missions** of the Son and Spirit as *ad extra* enactments revealing the *ad intra* order of the **divine processions**, while insisting on **one will** and **inseparable operations**. He employs **Rahner’s rule** that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa, but he buffers it with **divine simplicity** and **aseity** so that the revelation does not collapse God into history. Scripture’s authority is central, especially sustained attention to **John 5–17** on **sending**, **glory**, **love**, and **will**. Tradition’s role is regulative: **Athanasius** and **Augustine** supply categories by which exegesis avoids both **subordinationism** and a flattening of **triune relations**. The approach is doxological and pastoral. In his popular-level writing, Moody frames Christian life as contemplating the **Father’s love for the Son** and participating by the **Spirit** in that **filial communion**, so that doctrine flows into **sanctification**, **mission**, and **worship**.

#### 3. The Will of Him Who Sent Me: mission, obedience, and one will in John
The monograph-level argument represented by Moody’s **The Will of Him Who Sent Me** 2012 offers a sustained **Johannine** treatment of **authority**, **obedience**, and **sending**. He contends that the Son’s repeated avowal I have come to do the **will** of him who sent me signals a twofold reality: first, a genuinely human obedience in the incarnate Son’s **messianic vocation**; second, the revelation of an **order of relations** between **Father and Son** that belongs to the eternal taxis without implying a second **divine will** or **ontological subordination**. The book defends **eternal generation** as the doctrinal ground for reading **John 5:26**, **John 6:38**, and **John 17**: the Son receives **life** and **name** from the Father *ad intra*, and therefore receives a **mission** from the Father *ad extra*. Yet because of **divine simplicity** and the doctrine of **inseparable operations**, the **one divine will** is not parceled among three centers; the Son’s incarnate obedience is the human expression of the **Triune** work of salvation, not evidence of an eternal hierarchy of wills. Moody’s exegesis distinguishes **taxic primacy** of the Father in the order of origin from any rank of greatness, aligning **Johannine** claims about sending with **Nicene** orthodoxy and pushing back on readings that see **subordination** as eternal and functional within the **immanent Trinity**.

#### 4. In Light of the Son: contemplative dogmatics for ordinary disciples
In **In Light of the Son** 2015 Moody renders this **Nicene-Augustinian** framework devotionally. The driving claim is that all Christian knowing and living occurs in the radiance of the **Father’s love for the Son**, in whom the **Spirit** grants participation. The book popularizes **eternal generation**, **inseparable operations**, and **adoption** by showing their existential cash value: believers are incorporated into the **Son’s filial relation** and so learn to see creation, Scripture, ethics, and mission in the same **light** that the Father has always had for the **beloved Son**. Against thin moralism and disenchanted secular imaginaries, Moody argues that the world’s purpose is **doxological**, to share in the **glory** the Father gives the Son, echoing **John 17**. Theologically, the work retrieves **Calvin’s autotheos** in the sense of the Son’s **aseity** not as independence from the Father but as fully divine **life** received eternally from the Father. Pastoral aims are explicit: catechesis anchored in **Trinity**, sacramental piety centered on **union with Christ**, and mission patterned by the **Father’s sending** of the Son in **love**.

#### 5. Interlocutors: EFS, social trinitarianism, and the return to Nicaea
Moody’s writing sits athwart the 2016 **Eternal Functional Subordination** controversy. He affirms with **Wayne Grudem** and **Bruce Ware** that **John’s Gospel** depicts Christ’s real obedience and submission, but he aligns with critics such as **Kevin Giles** and **Millard Erickson** in denying that such obedience implies an **eternal hierarchical subordination** within the **immanent Trinity**. His crucial distinctions are between **mission** and **procession**, **economic obedience** and **ontological equality**, and **order of origin** without inequality. By retrieving **inseparable operations** and **one divine will**, Moody resists the neo-Social tendency to distribute agency across hypostases as if they were three centers, and also resists EFS proposals of eternal relations of authority and submission. He interprets **John 14–17** through **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, treating the Son’s **obedience** as the human enactment of the **Triune decree** and as revelatory of the **Father-Son taxis** grounded in **eternal generation**. In this respect, his position is a contemporary evangelical consolidation of **Nicene** commitments under the pressure of late modern debates about **gender**, **authority**, and **power**, reminding readers that the **homoousion** disallows any gradation in deity.

#### 6. Doctrinal synthesis: one will, missions grounded in processions, and the Spirit’s role
The doctrinal core of Moody’s synthesis is the interplay of **divine simplicity**, **one will**, and **missions grounded in processions**. He stresses that the **one simple God** acts indivisibly; therefore the missions of Son and Spirit are indivisible operations with **taxic** fittingness corresponding to their **eternal origin**: the Son is from the Father by **generation**, the Spirit from the Father and the Son by **spiration**. The consequence for **Christology** is a robust account of **theandric obedience** in which the incarnate Son, possessing a complete **human will** and **divine will**, renders perfect filial obedience in his **human will** to the **Father’s** willing, while remaining consubstantial and equal to the Father in the **divine will**. For **pneumatology**, Moody highlights the **Spirit’s mission** as the one who unites believers to the Son’s **sonship**, extending the Father’s **love** transitively to the church. For **soteriology**, **adoption** and **union with Christ** are neither moral metaphors nor bare forensics but participation, by the **Spirit**, in the **filial relation** revealed in **John**. For **ecclesiology**, the church’s **mission** imitates the Son’s being **sent**, such that authority is cruciform, authority is exercised in **love**, and obedience is rendered within **communion**. For **prolegomena**, Moody insists that **Scripture** supplies the truth conditions and **Nicene** grammar guards its coherence.

#### 7. Hermeneutic center: Johannine vision without flattening the canon
Moody’s use of **John’s Gospel** as a hermeneutical center reflects a conviction that **Johannine** categories of **glory**, **love**, **sending**, and **name** uniquely articulate the **Trinity** for ecclesial catechesis. Yet he aims to coordinate this center with the **Synoptics**, **Paul**, and **Hebrews**. The **Synoptics** show the Son’s **obedience** in narrative form, **Paul** expounds **union with Christ** and **adoption** as the Spirit’s filial gift, and **Hebrews** deepens the account of **priestly obedience** and **perfection**. Moody harmonizes these witnesses by a thick **Nicene** metaphysic of **processions**, grounding exegesis in metaphysical clarity without losing textual specificity. He appeals to **Augustine’s inseparable operations** to read, for example, **John 5:19** in light of **Colossians 1:15–20**, refusing interpretations that turn the Son into a junior partner or mere exemplar of human piety. The interpretive wager is that a **Johannine** focus aids catechesis by providing a luminous, doxological horizon in which **the Father’s love for the Son** makes intelligible the whole economy of **creation** and **redemption**.

#### 8. Pastoral-theological dividends: contemplation, sanctification, and mission
A hallmark of Moody’s contribution is translating **Trinitarian dogma** into pastoral practice. He proposes that contemplating the **Father’s love for the Son** reconfigures **sanctification** as filial conformity rather than voluntarist striving, under the agency of the **Spirit** who shares the Son’s **cry Abba** with believers. **Ethics** becomes apprenticing in the Son’s **obedience**; **worship** becomes participation in the Son’s **glorification** of the Father; **mission** becomes an extension of **sending** in humble witness. This pastoral reframing depends on the dogmatic stability of **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations**: God’s external work is the undivided work of the **Triune** God, so the believer’s communion is not with three rival agents but with the one **simple** God, personally appropriated through the Son and in the **Spirit**. Moody’s ecclesial strategy, visible in **TGCA** essays and resources, thus blends **catechesis**, **apologetics**, and **spirituality**, critiquing thin therapeutic moralities by offering a **doxological** regimen attuned to **John 17**.

#### 9. Reception, influence, and a Reformed/WTS evaluation
In the broader evangelical scene, Moody’s retrieval of **eternal generation**, **one divine will**, and **inseparable operations** has provided a stabilizing center amid the turbulence of **EFS** and the temptations of **social trinitarianism**. His work is read across denominational lines in Australia and beyond, particularly in catechetical contexts seeking to anchor **discipleship** in **Trinitarian** reality. Historically, his synthesis aligns with **Athanasius** and **Augustine**, interprets **Calvin’s autotheos** compatibly with **eternal generation**, and incorporates **Aquinas’s** doctrine of **processions** into an evangelical grammar governed by **Scripture**. As to a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, strengths include clear affirmation of **Westminster Confession 2** on **divine simplicity**, **unity of essence**, and **equality** of the persons, together with careful use of **inseparable operations** and a healthy denial of multiple **divine wills**. Tensions to probe include the extent of **Johannine** centrism as a material principle for systematics, which can risk under-theorizing **covenant** as the canonical architectonic. A classic **Reformed** alternative would balance Moody’s missions-processions grammar with the **pactum salutis** and **covenant of redemption**, locating the Son’s incarnate obedience within the **eternal decree** and **covenantal** ordering of salvation, while retaining one **divine will** and the theandric exercise of the Son’s **human will**. Similarly, cautious deployment of **Rahner’s rule** should maintain a robust **archetypal-ectypal** distinction to protect **Creator-creature** distance. Yet on the central issues at stake in contemporary debate, Moody’s retrieval of **Nicene** dogma, his exegetical care in **John**, and his pastoral translation into **adoption** and **union with Christ** mark his project as a welcome ally of **classical Reformed orthodoxy** in evangelical idiom.
