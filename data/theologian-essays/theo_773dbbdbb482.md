### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Harry Collins, born in 1943 in London, came of age during the high tide of postwar technoscience, when the cultural authority of physics and engineering was nearly axiomatic and the social sciences were learning to study that authority. His intellectual formation within the British sociology of scientific knowledge at Bath and later Cardiff placed him inside the contested space opened by **Thomas Kuhn’s paradigm theory**, pressed against **Popperian falsificationism** and **Lakatosian research programmes**, and then further radicalized by the **strong programme** of **David Bloor** and **Barry Barnes**. Against linear rationalist narratives, Collins adopted an empirical stance that treats scientific knowledge as a situated social accomplishment, guided by the **symmetry principle** that treats success and failure, truth and error, as equally needing sociological explanation. That symmetry did not amount to a denial of reality, but to a methodological eye for how institutions, practices, and tacit competences carry inquiry. The early Collins moved from philosophy of science to field-intensive **ethnography**, learning the speech, norms, and tensions of laboratory life and collaborations. The civic implication was always near: if knowledge is made in communities, public reason must grapple with how communities authorize and maintain **expertise**.

Collins’ method aligns with and modifies the **empirical programme of relativism**. He combined the Durkheimian impetus of the strong programme with **Wittgensteinian** insights into rule-following and language games, while mining **Michael Polanyi’s** notion of **tacit knowledge** and **Gilbert Ryle’s** knowing how versus knowing that. His signature move was to make tacit knowledge not a mystical residue but a set of analysable social practices that can be learned, transmitted, and sometimes lost. He deployed the idea of a **core-set**, the relatively small group of specialists who carry the burden of debate during a controversy, and he tracked the dynamics of closure, replication, and credibility. Unlike **Bruno Latour’s** actor-network theory, which levels human and nonhuman actants into a single web of associations, Collins stresses the specifically human sociolinguistic competences that enable sustained technical discourse and adjudication. The payoff is a sociologically thick account of how fields settle what counts as evidence and expertise.

#### 2. Changing Order and the problem of replication
The early theoretical crystallization appears in **Changing Order: Replication and Induction in Scientific Practice** 1985. Here Collins introduced the now-classic idea of **experimenters regress**, showing that the success of an experimental replication depends on prior judgments about whether the right procedures have been used, yet those same judgments depend on whether the results come out right. Replication is not merely mechanical copying of method; it is an exercise of **tacit knowledge** and interpretive skill within a community’s evolving standards. The regress is resolved not by algorithm but by social processes that stabilize what counts as a proper experiment, what counts as noise, and who counts as a competent judge. The book deepened the **core-set** analysis by mapping credibility contests, the movement of trust among laboratories, and the role of informal communications in shaping outcomes. Collins’ argument confronts naive empiricism without sliding into skepticism, proposing instead that the rationality of science is inseparable from its communal lifeworld, its tacit scaffolding.

In this frame Collins pressed a twofold claim. First, there is no vantage point outside practice from which to adjudicate method in abstraction; induction is embedded in disciplined communities. Second, such embedding is itself corrigible through the community’s own standards of criticism. The language of **credibility cycles** names this dynamic: journals, conferences, and reputations interact to create uptakes and downturns in confidence, which then feed back into resource flows and experimental ambition. These analyses secured Collins’ place among leading figures of **SSK**, while setting the stage for deeper case studies that would test the durability of his theses.

#### 3. From golems to machines: public science and human action
A second trajectory seeks to educate publics about the nature of science and the limits of automation. In **Artificial Experts: Social Knowledge and Intelligent Machines** 1990, and later in **The Shape of Actions** 1998 with **Martin Kusch**, Collins explored how human agency differs from machine performance. He argued that machines can emulate outputs but lack the **social embedding** that grants meaning to actions, a theme he would revisit in **Artifictional Intelligence** 2018. These works connect Polanyian **tacit knowledge** and Wittgensteinian rule-following to the practical demands of expertise, and they prefigure his later concept of **interactional expertise**. The point is not to mystify the human but to locate the constitutive role of shared forms of life in sustaining competence.

For broader audiences, **The Golem: What Everyone Should Know About Science** 1993, coauthored with **Trevor Pinch**, translated the SSK sensibility into vivid case studies. The golem trope depicts science as powerful yet clumsy, a crafted servant that does great things but is not omniscient. Against both scientism and cynicism, the book argued for a chastened respect: science works because communities make it work, often through messy dispute and painstaking repair. The sequel, **The Golem at Large** 1998, extended this to technology. These texts established Collins as a public interpreter of scientific authority who neither debunks nor sanctifies but historicizes and sociologizes, insisting on the **fallibility** and **instituted authority** of expert knowledge.

#### 4. Gravity and the sociology of discovery
Collins’ most celebrated fieldwork surrounds **gravitational-wave** research, culminating in **Gravity’s Shadow** 2004, **Gravity’s Ghost** 2010, and **Gravity’s Ghost and Big Dog** 2015. Over decades he embedded himself among bar-detector and interferometer communities, following the formation of LIGO and its competitors. The narrative displays **core-set** dynamics in slow motion: standards of data analysis evolve, detection pipelines are negotiated, and thresholds for claim-making are codified. The 2010 blind injection known as **Big Dog** dramatized how a community calibrates its skepticism and belief, revealing the communal muscles that would later bear the weight of the historic 2015 detection GW150914. Collins’ thesis is not that waves are socially constructed but that the capacity to recognize them is socially trained, and that discovery is as much about stabilizing interpretive practices as about registering signals.

These volumes also refine notions of **closure** and **credibility**. Closure does not end debate; it reallocates attention toward new puzzles under agreed constraints. Credibility is not mere prestige; it is the hard-won trust that allows far-flung laboratories to treat each other’s results as extensions of their own eyes. In showing how discovery claims are delayed, contested, and finally authorized by a small expert community, Collins made concrete the earlier abstractions of **experimenters regress**. He thereby offered theologians and philosophers an empirical account of how communal authority functions without invoking authoritarianism, and how normativity is enacted in practice rather than decreed a priori.

#### 5. Tacit knowledge and the architecture of expertise
The conceptual centerpiece of Collins’ mature work is a taxonomy of tacit knowledge and the correlative **periodic table of expertises**. In **Tacit and Explicit Knowledge** 2010 he distinguishes at least three types: **relational tacit knowledge**, which could be made explicit but is not because of relational or resource constraints; **somatic tacit knowledge**, anchored in embodied skill and sensori-motor habit; and **collective tacit knowledge**, irreducible to individuals because housed in a form of life, a shared culture. These distinctions underwrite the claim that many expert competences can be acquired through social immersion in the discourse and practices of a field, even in the absence of hands-on performance.

That claim is named **interactional expertise**, elaborated with **Robert Evans** in **Rethinking Expertise** 2007 and the 2002 article on the **third wave of science studies**. In contrast to **contributory expertise** possessed by bench scientists and instrument builders, interactional expertise equips mediators, managers, and interlocutors to participate fluently in technical discussions without doing the experiments themselves. Collins developed the **imitation game**, a Turing-test variant, to test whether fluency can be detected through discourse. The result is a nuanced map of expertise that recognizes gradients rather than an insider-outsider binary. In **Are We All Scientific Experts Now?** 2014, Collins presses the civic stake: democracies require mechanisms for distinguishing credible expertise from populist assertion. The upshot is normative. Methodological symmetry need not entail cultural relativism; it can enable a renewed account of why some expert claims deserve default deference.

#### 6. The third wave, SEE, and elective modernism
The shift from analytic description to normative guidance culminates in **Studies of Expertise and Experience** and the proposal of **elective modernism** in **Why Democracies Need Science** 2017. The **third wave of science studies** argues that after deconstructing scientific authority the task is to rebuild a way to live with expertise. Elective modernism recommends that citizens and institutions, aware of the social making of knowledge, nonetheless choose to privilege scientific institutions because of their distinctive **moral project** of organized skepticism, critical replication, and inflation-resistant standards. This is not a metaphysical realist argument but a political-ethical wager on the track record of certain communal forms of life. The goal is to support public decision-making that is neither technocratic nor anti-intellectual, by clarifying who counts as an expert on what, and how trust can be earned and lost.

Within this framework Collins engages critics such as **Bruno Latour** and **Steve Woolgar**, who sometimes seem to dissolve the specialness of science into general networks of power. He also interacts with **Ian Hacking’s** historical ontology and **Imre Lakatos’s** protective belt theory, appropriating select insights while maintaining the centrality of tacitly organized practices. In works on AI such as **Artifictional Intelligence** 2018 he extrapolates the expertise program into debates over machine autonomy, arguing that machines without **collective tacit knowledge** cannot bear the normative loads currently shouldered by human experts. The arc from reflexive relativism to normative reconstruction is thus complete: a sociology first humbles and then rehabilitates expert authority.

#### 7. Theological resonances: testimony, tradition, and the social shape of doctrine
Collins’ project bears directly on theological epistemology by clarifying how **testimony**, **tradition**, and **magisterial authority** function. The category of **tacit knowledge** illumines how doctrinal habitus is acquired: catechesis, liturgical repetition, and pastoral mentoring inculcate **somatic tacit knowledge** in gesture and prayer, **relational tacit knowledge** in pastoral wisdom, and **collective tacit knowledge** in the ecclesial form of life. The notion of a **core-set** helps explain why conciliar and confessional debates are often decided among a trained cadre whose discursive fluency allows them to parse conceptual fine points that remain opaque to outsiders. This is not clericalism. It is an analysis of how communities steward and transmit competence, analogous to Collins’ **interactional expertise** which many theologians possess when navigating biblical studies, patristics, and historical dogmatics while not practicing every subdiscipline.

Collins’ **periodic table of expertises** also clarifies the division of labor between theologians, pastors, and laity, reframing disputes about **perspicuity of Scripture** by distinguishing access to saving truth from the expertise required for technical doctrinal formulation. The **imitation game** maps onto processes by which catechumens come to speak the language of the creed, while still growing toward **contributory expertise** in moral discernment and doctrinal reasoning. His analysis of **credibility cycles** and **closure** deflates any simplistic narrative in which theology is pure deduction from first principles; it shows how communities cope with underdetermination and learn to trust certain exegetical and doctrinal moves through sustained practice.

#### 8. Science, religion, and public reason
In the science-religion arena, Collins’ **elective modernism** offers a middle path between **scientism** and **epistemic populism**. For the church this suggests a covenant with expert institutions that recognizes the morally praiseworthy disciplines of inquiry that science embodies, even while maintaining distinctive theological claims about creation and providence. His analysis of **experimenters regress** and **credibility cycles** encourages modesty in apologetic strategies that lean on overtidy claims of scientific proof for theism, while also arming theologians against facile dismissals of science as mere power. Theologically, Collins’ work can be refracted through doctrines of **creation** and **providence**: the stable patterns that science discerns are there to be found, but only a communal form of life tuned by patience and humility is able to discern them consistently.

Moreover, his critique of **AI autonomy** reinforces a Christian anthropology in which personhood and wisdom are inseparable from **collective tacit knowledge**, tradition, and language. That underwrites a more sacramental ecclesiology of knowledge, where truth is not merely held but inhabited. Finally, the civic dimension of **Rethinking Expertise** and **Why Democracies Need Science** helps churches think about **public theology**: how to weigh expert consensus on medical ethics, ecology, or technology without surrendering moral judgment. The discipline of identifying who has **interactional expertise** becomes a pastoral tool for discerning which voices deserve prudential deference in congregational deliberation.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and Westminster perspective the most valuable upshot of Collins is his thick account of **communal testimony** and **tacit practice**, which aligns with **covenantal epistemology**, the **habitus fidei**, and the role of the **church as interpretive community** under the **catholic rule of faith**. His mapping of **interactional expertise** resembles the Reformed idea that the Spirit equips a diversity of gifts for the edification of the body, including teachers who can mediate complex knowledge. The insistence that expertise is real and normatively defensible through **elective modernism** resonates with **common grace**, which preserves ordinary scientific rationality among fallen image-bearers. Yet tensions remain. Methodological **symmetry** risks obscuring the principial asymmetry of **revelation** as the principium cognoscendi of theology, anchored in the **self-authenticating Scripture** and the **Creator-creature distinction**. If truth is treated only as the outcome of **credibility cycles**, doctrinal authority could erode into sociological consensus, conflicting with a Reformed commitment to **correspondence truth** grounded in God’s speech. The **noetic effects of sin** also complicate any easy trust in communal mechanisms, reminding us that pathologies of prestige and power corrupt churches and sciences alike. A classically Reformed alternative would appropriate Collins’ tools while ordering them theologically: the Spirit forms **collective tacit knowledge** in the church through Word and sacrament; **interactional expertise** is sanctified prudence in the communion of saints; and deference to scientific expertise is received as common-grace wisdom, tested by Scripture’s sufficiency and the **confessional standards** that discipline the community’s hearing of God’s voice.
