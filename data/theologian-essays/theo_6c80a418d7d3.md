### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Gordon D. Fee, 1934 to 2022, emerged from the **Assemblies of God** into the wider academy just as **Pentecostalism** moved from the margins to a global Christian force. Educated in **New Testament** and trained in **textual criticism** in the era shaped by **Eldon Epp**, **Bruce Metzger**, and the **eclectic method**, he taught at **Gordon‑Conwell Theological Seminary** from 1966 to 1986 and **Regent College** from 1986 to 2002. That vocational arc placed him at the crossroads of **evangelical** and **charismatic** scholarship. Theologically he absorbed **G. E. Ladd’s** articulation of the **already and not yet** of the kingdom, which became the eschatological air of his **pneumatology** and his reading of **Paul**. Institutionally he served on the **NIV** and **TNIV** translation committees, providing a public window into his conviction that the church’s doctrine must be fed by responsible **exegesis** of the Greek text.

Fee’s method is classic **historical‑grammatical** exegesis disciplined by **authorial intent** and literary context, yet animated by a robust **Trinitarian** and **ecclesial** horizon. He rejects a **reader‑response** or experience‑driven hermeneutic, insisting in **Gospel and Spirit** that Pentecostal experience is a theological impetus, not a controlling epistemic norm. In **How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth**, coauthored with **Douglas Stuart** in 1981, he trained a generation to respect **genre**, to read **epistles** as occasional documents, to handle **narrative** with principled caution, and to practice **principlization** that moves from original sense to contemporary application. His compact manual **New Testament Exegesis** in 1983 became the classroom template for grammar, discourse analysis, and historical context, a method that underwrites his later **pneumatology** and **Christology**.

Fee’s pastoral and ecclesial instincts were inseparable from this method. He insisted that **exegesis** serves **edification**, that the **charismata** must be regulated by **love** and order as in **1 Corinthians 12 to 14**, and that the church’s life is cruciform. He aimed to correct the anti‑intellectualism that sometimes dogged **Pentecostal** piety while refusing the skepticism that often silences **spiritual gifts**. The signature of his project is a hermeneutics of **Word and Spirit** where **Scripture** rules and **experience** is tested, not vice versa.

#### 2. Major works and the shape of Pentecostal hermeneutics
Fee’s battle for a disciplined **Pentecostal hermeneutic** is clearest in **Gospel and Spirit** in 1991 and the widely used **How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth**. He faced two errors. On one side were **cessationist** arguments that treated **Acts** as merely descriptive and ruled out ongoing **charismata**. On the other side were hyper‑Pentecostal appeals to **narrative precedent** as normative without controls. Fee’s solution was a careful distinction between **description** and **principle**. **Acts** is not flat law, yet it witnesses to **patterns** and **intentionalities** in Luke’s theology. Normativity arises by tracing Luke’s thematic aims, the repetition of events across settings, and the coherence of **Acts** with **Pauline** theology. This framework allowed him to affirm contemporary **spiritual gifts** while refusing to canonize any single sequence of experiences as universal law.

That stance fed into his programmatic critique of classical Pentecostal **subsequence** and **initial evidence**. In **Gospel and Spirit**, Fee argued that **Spirit baptism** in the New Testament is part of **conversion‑initiation**, a unified complex of repentance, faith, water baptism, and reception of the **Spirit**. He welcomed tongues as a frequent gift and a powerful means of prayer, yet he contended that **glossolalia** is not mandated as the necessary sign of being baptized in the **Spirit**. His interlocutors included **James D. G. Dunn**, whose earlier Baptism in the Holy Spirit had also pressed toward conversion‑initiation, and **Howard Ervin** and **Robert Menzies**, who defended classical Pentecostal distinctives. Fee’s exegesis combined the **already and not yet** of **G. E. Ladd** with a pastoral realism about diverse experiences within the one **body of Christ**.

#### 3. The Corinthian crucible and regulation of the charismata
The commentary **The First Epistle to the Corinthians** in NICNT, 1987 and revised 2014, is a master‑class in how **Pentecostal** conviction and **exegetical** rigor can coexist. Fee reads **1 Corinthians 12 to 14** with the controlling thesis that the **charismata** are distributed by the **Spirit** for **edification** and must be governed by the **law of love** in **1 Corinthians 13**. He provides granular analysis of **glossolalia**, **prophecy**, and **interpretation**, arguing that tongues function both as private prayer and as corporate speech only when interpreted. He refuses both Corinthian enthusiasm, which elevated ecstatic speech, and modern **cessationism**, which reduces the Spirit’s work to quiet sanctification. His reading of **1 Corinthians 14** champions intelligibility and order as marks of the **Spirit**, not constraints upon the **Spirit**.

The same commentary became a flashpoint in debates over **women in ministry**. Fee contended that **1 Corinthians 11** assumes women pray and prophesy in the assembly, while **1 Corinthians 14:34 to 35** likely represents a later textual interpolation, a claim rooted in **text‑critical** analysis of Western dislocations and internal incoherence with the surrounding context. That judgment, together with his contextual reading of **1 Timothy 2** in **Listening to the Spirit in the Text** in 2000, positioned Fee within evangelical **egalitarianism** and provoked sustained interaction from **Anthony Thiselton**, **D. A. Carson**, and **Wayne Grudem**. The larger hermeneutical point was consistent: the **Spirit**’s gifts are for the whole **body**, and order derives from **edification**, not from the suppression of Spirit‑enabled voices.

#### 4. The Spirit in Paul: God’s empowering presence
Fee’s signature contribution is **God’s Empowering Presence** in 1994, a thousand‑page synthesis of **Pauline pneumatology**. The thesis is simple and sweeping: for **Paul**, the **Spirit** is the experienced, eschatological presence of **God** among his people, the **arrabon** down payment and **aparchē** firstfruits of the new creation, the **sphragis** seal of belonging, the power of **sanctification**, the bond of **adoption**, and the mode of **participation in Christ**. Fee works through every letter, amassing lexical, syntactic, and discourse evidence, and then synthesizes them into a **Trinitarian** and **ecclesial** portrait. The **Spirit** mediates the presence of the risen **Kyrios**, uniting believers to **Christ**, energizing **charismata**, and empowering cruciform **ethics** that mirror the **cross**.

Within this synthesis Fee sharpened controversial claims. On **2 Corinthians 3:17**, the phrase the **Lord is the Spirit** was read as asserting that the **Spirit** is the Lord of the new covenant, a functional identification in the economy that avoids ontological conflation. On **Galatians**, he emphasized the shift from **Torah** to **Spirit** as the new mode of life under the **new covenant**, aligning **sanctification** with Spirit‑enabled fulfillment of the law of **love**. On **Romans 8**, he foregrounded the Spirit’s role in **adoption**, **mortification**, and **assurance**, integrating **soteriology** with **pneumatology** rather than isolating justification as a strictly forensic transaction. Throughout, the **already and not yet** governs pastoral application. The gifts are foretastes, the groaning is real, and the **church** lives between **Pentecost** and **Parousia**.

#### 5. Pauline Christology and Trinitarian coherence
Fee’s **Pauline Christology** in 2007 widened the frame. Against minimalist reconstructions, he argued that **Paul** presupposes a robust **early high Christology**, evident in **preexistence** claims in **Philippians 2**, **Colossians 1**, and the consistent application of **Kyrios** to **Jesus** within **YHWH** texts in **1 Corinthians 8** and **Romans 10**. He engaged **James Dunn** on the Adamic reading of **Philippians 2**, pressing instead that the hymn speaks of the preexistent Son’s **kenosis** and obedience unto the **cross**. He stood alongside **Larry Hurtado** and **Richard Bauckham** in arguing that **worship** practices and scriptural exegesis embed Jesus within the **divine identity**. This Christological work anchors his **pneumatology**. The **Spirit** is not an impersonal force but the divine agent who mediates **union with Christ**, makes present the risen **Lord**, and forms the **church** as **temple**.

The **Trinitarian** integration is thus both exegetical and doxological. Exegetically, Fee shows how **Paul** moves effortlessly between **God**, **Lord**, and **Spirit** language while retaining Jewish monotheism. Doxologically, he insists that life in the **Spirit** leads to the confession of **Jesus as Lord** to the glory of **God the Father**. The whole is a **salvation‑historical** tapestry where **eschatology**, **Christology**, and **ecclesiology** interpenetrate. In this frame, **charismata** are not eccentric additions but expressions of **participation** in the risen Christ through the indwelling **Spirit**.

#### 6. Textual criticism and translation as ecclesial service
Parallel to his **pneumatology**, Fee labored in **textual criticism** and **translation**. His essays, collected with **Eldon Epp** in **Studies in the Theory and Method of New Testament Textual Criticism** in 1993, argued for a rigorous **reasoned eclecticism** that privileges the earliest and best witnesses while weighing internal evidence. He pressed the implications of the **papyri** for destabilizing **Byzantine** priority and the **Textus Receptus**, and he modeled how **textual variants** bear on exegesis, not merely on apparatus margins. His role with the **NIV** and **TNIV** meant that his judgments about **Greek** syntax and discourse affected the pew Bible. For Fee this was doxological humility. The church deserves translations shaped by coherent **exegetical method**, not by proof‑texts or inherited pieties.

This work explains both the strengths and controversies of his commentary judgments. The claim that **1 Corinthians 14:34 to 35** is secondary was not a hermeneutical shortcut but a **text‑critical** decision about dislocation and the flow of argument. Similarly, his willingness to challenge traditional readings of passages on **wealth**, **suffering**, or **gender** was bound to a conviction that the **Greek text** and the **author’s intent** must control theology. The yield was a portfolio of interpretations that are pastorally sharp and methodologically transparent.

#### 7. Ecclesial ethics, wealth, and the cross
Fee’s exegesis always returned to **ethics** and the **church**. In **1 Corinthians** and **Philippians**, he stressed cruciform **leadership**, **generosity**, and **unity** in the **Spirit**. He was a fierce critic of **prosperity theology**, arguing from **Philippians 3**, **2 Corinthians 8 to 9**, and **1 Timothy 6** that **suffering** and **contentment** are normal marks of **discipleship**, while **wealth** is a trust for **mission** and **mercy**. His shorter book **Paul, the Spirit, and the People of God** in 1996 popularized the thesis of **God’s Empowering Presence**, clarifying for lay readers how **Spirit** and **community** interrelate. In **Listening to the Spirit in the Text**, he developed a **hermeneutic of hearing** that is neither rationalist nor ecstatic. The **Spirit** speaks through the **text**, and the people discern together through **Scripture**, **wisdom**, and the pursuit of **edification**.

On **gender**, he synthesized **textual criticism**, **historical context**, and **theology of gifts** to commend **women**’s full participation in **ministry**, locating authority in the **word‑gift** itself rather than in gender. On **worship**, he advocated intelligibility, shared participation, and **Lord’s Supper** centrality as acts that display the **gospel**. On **mission**, he framed the **Spirit** as both power for witness and the presence who conforms the community to **holiness**. The ethic is not triumphalist. It is the **cross** made visible by the **Spirit** in a countercultural **church**.

#### 8. Influence, reception, and legacy
Fee’s influence is twofold. Among **Pentecostals**, he reformed **Spirit baptism** theology toward **conversion‑initiation**, insisted on **exegesis** over anecdote, and trained scholars who now populate **Assemblies of God** and **charismatic** institutions. Among evangelicals, he made the **Spirit** impossible to ignore in **Pauline theology** and helped normalize **continuationism** within a disciplined exegetical framework. His **NICNT** volumes, especially on **1 Corinthians** and **Philippians**, remain standard references because they combine lexical precision, **discourse analysis**, and pastoral sensitivity. His manuals, **How to Read the Bible for All Its Worth** and **New Testament Exegesis**, revolutionized classroom pedagogy across traditions.

He also bridged divides. Fee debated **James Dunn** yet shared an emphasis on **participation in Christ**. He crossed swords with **cessationist** readers yet maintained solidarity in **sola Scriptura** and **authorial intent**. He could be sharply critical of the **prosperity gospel** while championing **spiritual gifts**. In a field prone to polarization, he modeled charity without compromise. His death in 2022 prompted tributes from **Pentecostal**, **evangelical**, and **Reformed** scholars alike, a sign that his work had transcended tribal boundaries through the power of **exegesis**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Fee’s project offers notable convergences and real tensions. Positively, his **historical‑grammatical** discipline, his **Trinitarian** coherence, and his **already and not yet** eschatology harmonize with **union with Christ** and with a **Word‑governed** ministry of the **Spirit**. His relocation of **Spirit baptism** into **conversion‑initiation** aligns with **effectual calling** and **monergistic grace**, and his critique of **prosperity theology** echoes a Reformed **theology of the cross**. His emphasis on **edification**, **order**, and the primacy of **love** in regulating the **charismata** comports with the **Westminster** concern for **peace and purity** in the church. Yet there are pressures. First, his **continuationism** and defense of contemporary **prophecy** sit uneasily with classic **cessationism** that secures the **sufficiency of Scripture** and the finality of **special revelation** in the **canon**. Second, his **egalitarian** conclusions on **1 Corinthians 14** and **1 Timothy 2**, especially the **text‑critical** judgment of interpolation, challenge the **inerrancy** instincts and **complementarian** commitments common in **WTS** circles. Reformed orthodoxy can acknowledge textual variants in the **autographs**, yet the removal of difficult texts raises prudential questions about canonical stability and **creational order**. Third, Fee’s minimal use of **covenant** and the **means of grace** leaves his **ecclesiology** more charismatic than sacramental, whereas **Westminster** locates the Spirit’s ordinary operations in **Word, sacrament, and prayer**. A constructive Reformed alternative would receive Fee’s **eschatological pneumatology** and his **conversion‑initiation** insight, affirm the **charismata** as non‑revelatory providences subordinated to the **Word**, retain **complementarian** order grounded in **creation and covenant**, and deepen the account of sanctifying grace through **Calvin’s duplex gratia** of **justification** and **sanctification** within the church’s ordinary **means of grace**.
