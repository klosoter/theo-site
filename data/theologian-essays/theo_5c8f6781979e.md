### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, method
Jeffrey Koperski is a contemporary philosopher of science whose vocation sits at the juncture of **physics**, **metaphysics**, and **theology**. Trained within the **analytic** tradition and working in the milieu after logical positivism, he approaches the science-and-religion conversation with a realist sensibility about scientific theories but a critical eye toward unwarranted **scientism**. In intellectual terms, his work emerges after the debates of the late twentieth century over **methodological naturalism**, the revival of **metaphysics of laws** in the wake of figures like **D. M. Armstrong** and **David Lewis**, and the rediscovery of classical themes of **divine action** within philosophy of religion. Koperski’s central project is to articulate how **laws of nature**, as understood in contemporary philosophy of science, relate to **divine agency**, especially with respect to **miracles**, **providence**, and **determinism**. His analytic method is marked by conceptual precision, case studies from **physics** and **cosmology**, and a model-centered account of explanation that foregrounds scientific **idealizations**.

If there is a historical backdrop, it is the long shadow of **Hume** on **miracles**, coupled with the twentieth-century insistence that science presupposes a closed natural order under fixed **laws**. Koperski reads this backdrop through two post-positivist lenses. First, he adopts a model-based picture in which scientific laws are extracted from and embedded within idealized **models** that simplify complex systems, following the work of **Nancy Cartwright** on how **the laws of physics lie** by idealization while remaining indispensably true within their intended regimes. Second, he draws on the metaphysical turn in philosophy of science, pressing the question of whether **laws** are prescriptive necessities or descriptive regularities, whether they exclude external causes, and how they relate to **causal powers** and **agent causation**. This twofold focus structures his engagement with **theology**, especially the integrity of **special divine action** without conflict with modern **physics**.

Methodologically, Koperski triangulates between three poles: a modest **scientific realism** about the content of mature physics, a broadly **theistic metaphysics** that takes **God** as an agent with causal powers, and a cautious epistemic stance that avoids **God-of-the-gaps** reasoning. He distinguishes **methodological naturalism** as a pragmatic research policy from **metaphysical naturalism** as a worldview commitment, arguing that the former need not entail the latter. Within this frame, he is sympathetic to **Plantinga’s** critique of the pretensions of unguided science and of the inevitability of metaphysical assumptions in theory choice, even as he prosecutes his case by detailed analysis of **laws of nature** and **model-building**. The upshot is a consistent assertion: claims about **divine action** do not live or die on the altar of physics, because physics, properly understood, does not legislate metaphysical closures on causation.

#### 2. The Physics of Theism: scope and restraint
Koperski’s 2015 book, **The Physics of Theism**, functions as both survey and intervention on the interface of **physics** and **theology**. It canvasses topics such as **cosmology**, **fine-tuning**, **time and eternity**, **quantum mechanics**, and **determinism**, attending to classic theistic arguments while measuring their reach and limits under contemporary science. The book’s thesis is modest yet decisive: nothing in modern physics undercuts core theistic claims about **creation**, **providence**, and **miracle**; on the contrary, when the metaphysical underpinnings of **laws of nature** and theoretical representation are clarified, the conceptual space for **divine agency** widens. He is critical of overconfident readings of **Big Bang cosmology** as either proof or disproof of **creation ex nihilo**, insisting that **cosmological models** are not one-to-one maps of reality and that the metaphysical doctrine of creation concerns **ontological dependence** rather than temporal initiation alone. Likewise, in addressing **fine-tuning**, he appreciates its evidential force as part of a cumulative **abductive** case for **theism** while resisting inflationary probabilistic claims that outrun our background knowledge.

At the heart of The Physics of Theism is Koperski’s sustained analysis of **determinism**. Against the widespread belief that **classical mechanics** delivers a fully deterministic universe, he highlights sources of indeterminacy such as **chaos**, sensitivity to initial conditions, and the dependence of determinism on mathematical assumptions about well-posedness. He gestures toward cases like **Norton’s dome** to show that not all classical systems have unique temporal evolutions given initial data. In **quantum mechanics**, where indeterminism is often thought canonical, he emphasizes that deterministic interpretations remain live options. The conclusion is not that the world is indeterministic, but that the status of determinism is theory-laden and contingent upon interpretation. This insight undercuts the claim that **divine action** must hide in indeterministic gaps. For Koperski, both deterministic and indeterministic frameworks can admit **special divine action** once the metaphysics of **law** and **causation** is rightly set.

Equally important is his critique of the scientific and philosophical cliché that **miracles** violate **laws of nature**. He argues that this claim equivocates on the nature of law and assumes a **closed system** idealization that science itself constantly relaxes. Laws, on his view, hold ceteris paribus within closed or idealized systems; when an external cause enters the system, the relevant models change. The arrival of an agent cause, such as a human pushing a cart, is not treated as a violation of Newtonian laws but as a boundary condition or force term the prior model did not include. Likewise, an act of **God** need not be a violation of laws but the introduction of a new causal input not captured by the previous model. Here Koperski recruits both the pragmatics of model-building and the metaphysics of **agent causation** to deflate the rhetoric of law-violation. He presses the Humean debate by aligning with **John Earman’s** verdict that **Hume’s** argument against miracles is an abject failure, not least because it smuggles in a metaphysical view of **laws** as exceptionless necessities that is neither mandated by physics nor cogent in metaphysics.

#### 3. Divine Action, Determinism, and the Laws of Nature: a metaphysical pivot
Koperski’s 2020 book, **Divine Action, Determinism, and the Laws of Nature**, is the systematic backbone of his project. It advances a metaphysical thesis about the status of **laws of nature** and their relation to **divine agency**, while addressing the knot of **determinism**, **freedom**, and **providence**. The book takes aim at both the **Humean** and **necessitarian** extremes. Against **Lewisian** Humeanism, which treats laws as mere summaries of the total mosaic of events, Koperski insists that scientific practice presupposes modal structure, **causal powers**, and explanatory roles for lawlike generalizations that go beyond description. Against strong **necessitarianism** in the vein of **Armstrong**, he argues that treating laws as metaphysically iron-clad dictates risks the very picture of a sealed order that generates conflicts with **miracle** and **special divine action**. His positive proposal leans toward a powers-based or dispositionalist view in which both objects and agents have real causal capacities, and **laws** express stable but defeasible tendencies manifested under appropriate conditions.

The controlling idea is that **laws** are embedded in a hierarchy of **models** and **idealizations**. In scientific explanation, we represent systems by stripping away distracting influences to study core dynamics. Within that carving, laws are exact and exceptionless. But the world is multi-causal, and most actual situations are not closed. When new causes, including **agent causes**, appear, we adjust the model rather than declare law-breakage. Koperski argues that this model-based understanding allows robust **divine action** without ad hoc caveats. It is not a retreat to mystery; it is a sober account of how science already works. The critical upshot is that physics does not exclude **intervention**, because intervention simply means the introduction of causal factors not previously included in the model. He prefers to speak of **agent-causal** action to avoid the misleading connotations of intervention as intrusive law-busting. This makes room for a providential **concursus** picture in which **God** as primary cause can act through, with, or upon secondary causes, and at times directly, without metaphysical collision with **laws**.

A second major theme is Koperski’s critique of so-called **noninterventionist divine action** programs associated with **Murphy**, **Russell**, and others. These projects often fade **special divine action** into the background by locating it in lawful indeterminacies, for example quantum events amplifying to macro effects, in order to preserve the alleged inviolability of **laws of nature**. Koperski demurs on two fronts. First, he argues that the inviolability premise is faulty because **laws** do not function as absolute metaphysical constraints; they are conditional regularities within specified domains. Second, the fixation on indeterminism is unnecessary; both deterministic and indeterministic settings admit **agent causation** and **primary-secondary** causal coordination. He concludes that programs seeking to shield **miracles** from scientific scrutiny by appealing to hidden quantum indeterminacies are both epistemically weak and theologically thin. A sober metaphysics of **law** and **causation** is a better ally.

Koperski also engages the probabilistic evaluation of **miracle** claims, critically assessing **Bayesian** approaches that follow **Hume** in invoking uniform experience against the miraculous. He notes, with **Earman**, that uniform experience cannot be asserted without begging the question, and that the evidential weight of testimonial and physical evidence must be adjudicated case by case within a background theory that already includes or excludes divine agency. Because **theism** is a live metaphysical option with independent warrant, miracle reports cannot be dismissed a priori on probabilistic grounds. Here Koperski’s analytic discipline meets theological prudence: he refuses both credulity and a priorism, advocating a calibrated **inference to the best explanation** where **divine action** remains a candidate cause among others.

#### 4. Doctrinal interfaces: creation, providence, and miracle
The doctrinal significance of Koperski’s work lies in its conceptual tools for **creation**, **providence**, and **miracle** under the light of modern **physics**. On **creation**, he clarifies that **creation ex nihilo** is not a physical event in time but a claim about the ontological dependence of the cosmos on **God’s** free act. Whether **cosmology** posits a temporal beginning, a multiverse, or a quantum gravitational past, none of these settle the metaphysical question. This is aligned with classical **doctrines of divine aseity and freedom**, and it blocks attempts to weaponize scientific temporality against **creatio continua** or **primary causality**. On **providence**, Koperski’s appropriation of **concursus** language manifests in a careful account of how **primary and secondary causes** relate. He counsels that talk of God acting must be disciplined to agent causation rather than force-addition in a mechanistic picture. Theologically, this gives traction to doctrines of **governance** and **special providence**, allowing for both ordinary conservation and extraordinary action without ontological dualism.

On **miracles**, his proposal is unapologetically realist. A miracle is not a gap in knowledge but a special instance of **divine agency** for salvific or revelatory purposes. The key metaphysical claim is that the occurrence of a miracle does not pit God against **laws of nature** since laws supervene on and express the stable tendencies of created natures under specified conditions. If **God** introduces new conditions or acts as a superordinate cause, we do not have a law-violation but a lawful occurrence of a different kind, just as human agency can produce non-spontaneous configurations without overthrowing mechanics. This agent-causal approach rescues **biblical miracle** claims from pseudo-scientific vetoes and places their evaluation within a larger theological and historical framework, where questions of covenantal meaning and canonical attestation belong.

A further dividend of Koperski’s picture is its chastening of **methodological naturalism**. He argues that while the natural sciences often and wisely proceed by bracketing non-natural causes for the sake of tractable research, this bracketing is a heuristic, not a metaphysical boundary marker. Attempts to harden methodological naturalism into a rule that science cannot consider **intelligent agency** or **divine action** devolve into philosophical censorship. For **forensic science**, **archaeology**, and **SETI**, agent-causal hypotheses are admissible when warranted; biology and cosmology, he contends, should be no different in principle, even if in practice the evidentiary bar is high. This stance resonates with **Plantinga’s** critique of the naturalistic straitjacket and reframes debates over **intelligent design** by relocating them under broader questions of explanatory pluralism and the place of **agency** in scientific practice.

#### 5. Interlocutors and alignment
Koperski’s arguments draw strength from strategic alliances within philosophy of science and religion. From **Cartwright**, he inherits the conviction that **laws** are true in their modelled domains and that science traffics in **idealizations** rather than God’s-eye descriptions. From **Earman**, he gains the demolition of **Hume’s** case against **miracles**, showing it to be either circular or empirically vacuous. Against **Lewis**, he rejects a thin **Humean** supervenience that deflates modality; against strong **necessitarianism** like **Armstrong’s**, he resists reifying laws into iron constraints. With **Maudlin**, he appreciates the irreducible role of modal structure in physics. Within philosophy of religion, he engages **Plantinga** on the legitimacy of theistic metaphysics in theory assessment and is critical of science-and-religion programs that overprotect the sanctity of **laws** and thereby attenuate **special divine action**. He shares with **Polkinghorne** a respect for physics and with **Russell** an interest in structured accounts of **divine action**, but he parts company when noninterventionist strictures drain **agency** from miracle.

Stylistically, Koperski hews to the analytic virtues of clarity, disaggregation of issues, and careful distinction drawing. His use of examples from **classical mechanics**, **quantum theory**, and **cosmology** is not decorative; it is inferentially central to how he dismantles the supposed conflict between **physics** and **theism**. He is measured in apologetic aims, preferring to underwrite conceptual compatibility and remove roadblocks rather than to rest sweeping natural theological arguments on contested science. Yet he is not shy about **abductive** support for **theism**, particularly in discussions of **fine-tuning**, where theism can function as an explanatory framework for the deep order and life-permitting parameters of the universe, without claiming decisive probabilistic victory.

#### 6. Doctrinal development and pastoral prudence
While primarily a philosopher, Koperski’s work has doctrinal consequences for Christian theology. By reframing **laws of nature** and restoring **agent causation**, he enriches the grammar of **providence** and **miracle** in ways that cohere with classical **theism** and **creatio ex nihilo**. His account encourages theologians to resist assimilation to a deistic picture of God withdrawing for the sake of **laws**, and it empowers exegesis that treats **biblical miracles** as live historical claims. His analysis of **determinism** and **indeterminism** also intersects with debates on **divine sovereignty** and **human freedom**. Because he avoids resting **divine action** on indeterministic gaps, he sidesteps objections that luck would underwrite providence, instead allowing for a robust **concursus** framework where **God’s** governance is both meticulous and meaningful.

There is pastoral prudence in Koperski’s emphasis on model-based **laws** and the fallibility of metaphysical overreach. He cautions against weaponizing scientific models for or against doctrine, insisting on the limited scope of **physics** for settling metaphysical claims. In ecclesial contexts, this arrests the pathologies of both scientistic skepticism about **miracles** and anti-scientific reactionism. The church can affirm the reality of **divine action** without fear that physics will prove her foolish; and it can honor the achievements of **science** without granting it jurisdiction over **God**.

#### 7. Limits and prospects
Koperski’s project is deliberately bounded. He does not develop a full **natural theology**, nor does he offer a comprehensive **philosophy of mind** or **metaphysics of persons** that would secure agent causation beyond the sketch provided. He presupposes enough of a powers ontology to make sense of **agency** and **law**, but he leaves open debates over the exact nature of dispositions, their grounding, and their relation to **divine simplicity** or **immutability**. Furthermore, his reliance on the internal epistemics of **science** can appear to underplay thick **revelation** and **ecclesial** tradition in adjudicating claims about **miracles**. Yet the restraint is a strength: by clearing conceptual ground about **laws** and **causation**, he equips theologians to do constructive work in **doctrine** with fewer philosophical encumbrances.

Looking ahead, Koperski’s model-based account invites further interaction with contemporary **causal modeling**, **interventionist** accounts in the style of **James Woodward**, and renewed Thomistic and Reformed discussions of **concursus**. His critique of **noninterventionist divine action** sets a research agenda for theology seeking to reclaim thick accounts of **miracle** and **providence** without capitulation to either deism or occasionalism. In broader apologetic terms, his insistence that **physics** neither dictates nor debunks **theism** is a salutary corrective in a culture tempted by both sides of the conflict thesis.

#### 8. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage, Koperski’s work is a welcome ally on three fronts: the affirmation of **special divine action**, the chastening of **methodological naturalism** as a merely pragmatic rule, and the deployment of **concursus** as a grammar for **providence** under modern **physics**. His agent-causal, model-based account coheres with **divine sovereignty** and **creation ex nihilo**, and it retrieves an older Reformed confidence that **God** can and does act within history for covenantal ends. Yet a Westminster sensibility, shaped by **Sola Scriptura**, **covenantal epistemology**, and **Van Tilian** critiques of autonomy, will press him at three points. First, method: while Koperski wisely undercuts scientistic closure, his default evidential posture can appear too neutral. A Reformed account would heighten the role of **revelation** as principium for the interpretation of **miracles** and caution that metaphysical adjudication is never religiously indifferent. Second, metaphysics: his powers-and-law framework fits well with **concursus**, but Reformed orthodoxy will insist that **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** not be diluted by talk of divine action as one cause among others. The resolution is to anchor agent causation in **God’s** transcendent primary causality while maintaining the integrity of created natures, as in classical **concursus** rather than occasionalism or competitive causality. Third, nature and grace: Koperski’s distinction between **methodological** and **metaphysical naturalism** is salutary, yet a Reformed alternative prefers to cast the zone of inquiry under the covenantal order of **creation-fall-redemption**, where even methodology is normed by **God’s** Word. Within these adjustments, Reformed theology can appropriate Koperski’s central insight: properly understood, **laws of nature** pose no principled obstacle to **miracle**, **providence**, or the lordship of Christ over creation.
