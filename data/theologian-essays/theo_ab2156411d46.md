### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
William D. Dennison emerges within the late-modern **Reformed** world shaped by **Westminster Theological Seminary** and the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church**, where **Cornelius Van Til’s** **covenantal presuppositionalism** and **Geerhardus Vos’s** **redemptive-historical eschatology** provided the architectonic principles for theology and apologetics. His intellectual project took shape as evangelical and Reformed communities faced the double pressure of **scientific naturalism** and **postmodern critical theory**, while wresting anew with **Kuyperian** legacies of **sphere sovereignty** and the contours of **common grace**. Dennison’s method combines the **self-attesting Christ of Scripture** with **Paul’s two-age construction** and the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief taught in **Romans 1**, yielding a program that refuses epistemic neutrality while insisting on the **already/not yet** as the horizon of knowledge and culture.

The early consolidation of this stance appears programmatically in **Paul’s Two-Age Construction and Apologetics** (2000), where Dennison argues that Paul’s contrast between **this age** and **the age to come** functions not merely as eschatological timeline but as an epistemic and ethical structure for the Christian life. In line with **Van Til’s** rejection of autonomous reason, Dennison insists that the regenerate mind participates, by the Spirit, in an **eschatological prolepsis** of the **age to come**, while the unregenerate, though inescapably addressed by **general revelation**, suppress the truth in unrighteousness according to **Romans 1**. This yields a method that is simultaneously **transcendental** and **covenantal**: Christian theism is argued as the necessary condition for predication, science, morality, and culture because creation, fall, redemption, and consummation govern the possibility of meaning.

Dennison’s institutional location and pastoral labor in the **OPC** reinforced the Unity of doctrine and practice that the **Westminster Standards** articulate, especially the primacy of **Scripture’s self-attestation** and the sufficiency of **special revelation** for saving knowledge. At the same time, he appropriates **Vos’s** insight that the whole field of biblical theology is ordered by **eschatology**, so that the Christian’s epistemic posture is conditioned by the **already/not yet**; knowledge is situated within the **historia salutis**, not abstracted from it. From **Kuyper** and the **Amsterdam** tradition he receives a concern to interpret culture under **sphere sovereignty**, though mediated through **Van Til’s** sharper emphasis on **antithesis**.

#### 2. Two-age eschatology as apologetic architecture
The pivot of Dennison’s contribution lies in articulating how the **two-age construction** does the architectonic work for **apologetics**. In **Paul’s Two-Age Construction and Apologetics** (2000), he reads Pauline texts where the contrast of **aiōn houtos** and **aiōn mellōn** frames anthropology, ethics, and epistemology: the power of **sin** and the **stoicheia tou kosmou** mark **this age**, while the **Spirit** and the **new creation** are the powers of **the age to come**. The **already/not yet** of resurrection life, seen in **union with Christ**, generates what Dennison calls an **ethical-epistemic antithesis**, so that the apologist does not traffic in a neutral **via media**, but testifies to the **lordship of Christ** as the condition for any coherent account of knowledge, morality, and hope. The transcendental thrust remains **Van Tilian**: only the triune God revealed in **Scripture** can secure the possibility of rational predication; but Dennison’s distinctive move is to narrate that transcendental necessity within **eschatological teleology**.

This eschatological contour reframes the question of **point of contact**. Dennison agrees with **Van Til** that the **imago Dei** and the world as **covenantal creation** provide a point of contact, yet these are always encountered under the **noetic effects of sin** and the historical tension of the two ages. Consequently, **common grace** cannot be converted into **neutral common ground**. Rather, the apologist presses the **covenantal antithesis** while acknowledging that vestiges of truth persist by divine restraint. For Dennison, the **Spirit’s** work of regeneration is the decisive entrance of **the age to come** into human knowing, granting a participation in the **light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ** that is irreducibly **pneumatological** and **eschatological**.

The methodological payoff is a reorientation of apologetics away from piecemeal evidences toward a **worldview-level** defense that is historical, redemptive, and teleological. Evidence is not jettisoned; it is subordinated to the **covenantal** and **eschatological** frame. Thus the miracles of **Christ**, the **resurrection**, and the reliability of **Scripture** are presented as facts within the only world in which facts are intelligible: the world created, upheld, and consummated by the triune God, a world now in the **already** of **new creation** and moving toward the **not yet** of consummation.

#### 3. Cultural apologetics between Kuyper and Van Til
Dennison’s **In Defense of the Eschaton: Essays in Reformed Apologetics** (2015) gathers decades of work on philosophy, culture, and worldview, staging a conversation between **Kuyper’s** **sphere sovereignty** and **Van Til’s** **antithesis**, with analytical help from **Herman Dooyeweerd** and **D. H. Th. Vollenhoven**. The constructive thrust is to show that cultural life bears an **eschatological** direction because creation itself is teleological. Art, science, politics, and education are not neutral terrains; they are arenas ordered toward or away from the **Sabbath consummation**. Dennison appreciates **Dooyeweerd’s** modal analysis and the critique of the **nature-grace** dualism, yet he consistently subordinates philosophy to **special revelation**, insisting that any account of culture must be regulated by **Scripture’s redemptive-historical** plot.

Within this cultural frame, Dennison clarifies the terms of **common grace**. He resists both the triumphalist misreading that expects a gradual historical construction of the **kingdom**, and the quietist construal that relegates faith to the private sphere as in some **Two-Kingdoms** proposals. The **antithesis** is real and intensifies across history, yet mercy restrains sin, enabling relative civic goods. The **eschatological** horizon disciplines cultural expectations: the Christian engages culture as a pilgrim people, bearing witness to the **new creation** without collapsing penultimate tasks into ultimate eschatology. This yields a chastened but active **Kuyperian** posture, filtered through **Van Til’s** emphasis on **covenantal confrontation**.

A particular strength of these essays is how Dennison maps the **noetic effects of sin** onto institutions, practices, and traditions. Universities, museums, laboratories, and courts instantiate rival **liturgies** of ultimacy, often sacralizing immanent ideals. The apologist’s task, in Dennison’s telling, is to expose the suppressed **covenantal** commitments underwriting such practices and to commend the **self-attesting** authority of **Christ** as the only intelligible telos of knowledge and culture. The animating concern remains **eschatological**: all cultural projects are, at bottom, contestations about the **end** of human life and the world.

#### 4. Marx as rival eschatology
Dennison’s **Karl Marx** (2017) in the P&R Great Thinkers series advances his program by reading modern ideology as parasitic on Christian **eschatology**. He situates **Marx’s** synthesis of **Hegel** and **Feuerbach** as an **immanentized eschaton**, reinterpreting alienation and redemption as economic and political processes. In this frame, the dialectic of history replaces **providence**, class consciousness substitutes for **faith**, and the classless society mimics the **new creation** while excluding the Creator. By tracking themes from the **Theses on Feuerbach** through **The German Ideology** and **Capital**, Dennison shows how **historical materialism** functions as an alternative metanarrative, claiming universality, normativity, and teleology without a transcendent reference point.

The analysis employs classic **Van Tilian** tools. Marxist thought is construed as a **covenantal** rebellion that suppresses the divine witness of **general revelation** and reorganizes meaning around an idol of history and production. Dennison presses the **transcendental** critique: the very tools Marx requires to condemn alienation depend on moral and metaphysical realities that dialectical materialism cannot supply. He also connects **Marxism** and later **critical theory** to a broader pattern of secularized **eschatology**, arguing that modern and postmodern ideologies are best engaged by exposing their counterfeit **already/not yet** and offering the biblical **eschaton** as the only horizon that does justice to human dignity, justice, and hope.

Here Dennison’s cultural apologetics is most concrete. By interpreting revolutions of art, politics, and academy through the prism of rival **eschatologies**, he turns the conversation from isolated propositions to the claims of **lordship**. The Christian answer to alienation is not praxis-as-salvation but **union with Christ**, the downpayment of the **Spirit**, and the hope of resurrection. This allows him to frame public engagement as a witness to the **kingdom** without capitulating to utopianism or retreating into privatized piety.

#### 5. Scripture, hermeneutics, and doctrinal integration
Although Dennison writes as an apologist, his commitments bind tightly to **doctrine** and **hermeneutics**. Following **Vos**, he reads **Scripture** as a progressive history of **special revelation** that moves toward the **eschaton** in Christ. The **already/not yet** not only shapes his apologetic, it also regulates how doctrines cohere. **Soteriology** is cast in **union with Christ**, **pneumatology** in terms of **firstfruits**, **ecclesiology** as a pilgrim community, and **ethics** as the new obedience of those who taste the powers of **the age to come**. This redemptive-historical posture limits constructive ventures that rely on speculative **natural theology**, redirecting inquiry to the **covenantal** economy where God binds himself by promise and oath.

Dennison’s resistance to autonomous **natural theology** does not deny **general revelation** or the **light of nature**. He reiterates **Westminster**-style affirmations of creation’s clarity while warning that appeals to nature, apart from the **canon’s** interpretation, easily morph into **neutrality** that erodes the **antithesis**. Hence his apologetic begins and ends with **Scripture’s self-attestation**, the authority of the **triune God**, and the confession that all things are from, through, and to him. The **transcendental argument** is not a freestanding philosophical device; it is the systematic expression of the **covenantal** claim that only the God who speaks in **Scripture** can ground reason, morals, beauty, and hope.

A final integrative feature is Dennison’s dogged insistence that **eschatology** is not an appendix to systematic theology but a ruling principle. Creation is from the beginning ordered to **Sabbath rest**; redemption is the inbreaking of that rest in **Christ**; the **Spirit** brings believers into the **already** of that future. Theology, exegesis, preaching, and apologetics must be oriented to that telos. This insistence aligns Dennison not only with **Vos** and **Gaffin** but also with strands of classic **Reformed orthodoxy** that treated **consummation** as the horizon of law, gospel, and covenant.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and developments
Over time Dennison’s essays trace careful engagements with **Kuyper**, **Dooyeweerd**, and **Vollenhoven**, sifting what aids a **covenantal apologetic** from what could imperil **Scripture’s** preeminence. He welcomes **sphere sovereignty** as a guard against totalizing statism and ecclesial overreach, while insisting that vocational spheres are ultimately ordered to **Christ’s** lordship and the **eschaton**. From **Dooyeweerd**, he appropriates the exposure of **immanence philosophies** and the critique of the **nature-grace** synthesis, yet he resists turning philosophy into a meta-theory that could rival theology’s normativity. The net result is an apologetic that is aggressively biblical, culturally alert, and historically self-aware.

Within the Reformed family, Dennison’s posture generates debate with **Two-Kingdoms** proposals and modern **natural law** retrievals. He warns that a sharp nature-grace dualism risks encoding a **neutral realm** that blunts the **antithesis** and marginalizes **eschatology**. Conversely, he cautions against a triumphalizing **transformationalism** that confuses the **already** with the **not yet**. His preferred path foregrounds **pilgrim holiness**, principled cultural engagement, and a vivid confession of **Christ’s** present reign and coming **consummation**. Throughout, he is guided by the conviction that apologetics is a ministerial function of theology serving the **church’s** mission, rather than a freelance philosophical enterprise.

Dennison’s work also intersects biblically with discussions of **Pauline theology**, especially the role of the **resurrection**, **union with Christ**, and **the powers** in shaping ethics and knowledge. While not a specialist in textual debates, he leans on the **Vos-Gaffin** trajectory to insist that **Paul’s** eschatology is the indispensable groundwork for both doctrinal construction and defense of the faith. This theological exegesis guards his apologetic from collapsing into method, keeping it tethered to **Christ** and the **gospel**.

#### 7. Summary of contribution
Across his writings, Dennison’s enduring contribution is conceptual clarity: **eschatology** is not optional to **apologetics**; it is the scaffolding on which the entire defense of the faith rests. In **Paul’s Two-Age Construction and Apologetics** (2000) he sets the foundation; in **In Defense of the Eschaton** (2015) he extends it across cultural terrains; in **Karl Marx** (2017) he tests it against a canonical modern rival. The result is a robustly **covenantal** program that speaks intelligibly to late-modern anxieties about meaning, justice, and hope by insisting that all such quests are finally **eschatological** and that only the crucified and risen **Christ** secures their truth.

Reformed/WTS evaluation. Dennison’s strengths are manifest: a stringent refusal of **neutrality**, a deep integration of **eschatology** and **apologetics**, and a disciplined submission to **Scripture’s self-attestation**. Possible tensions arise where his polemic against autonomous **natural theology** can be heard as a diminution of the **light of nature** and **general revelation** confessed by classic **Reformed orthodoxy**. A Westminster-friendly alternative clarifies that the problem is not **natural law** per se but its deployment apart from the **covenantal** canon; likewise, creation has real, stable orders that remain good under the **already/not yet** without being identified with the **kingdom’s** consummation. In short, Dennison’s antithetical **covenantal apologetic** should be complemented by a carefully articulated doctrine of creation’s integrity and **common grace**, as in **Bavinck’s** organic motif, while retaining the central insight that only **revelation**, ordered to **consummation**, can norm and heal our knowledge of God and the world.
