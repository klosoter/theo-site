### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John Dyer is a contemporary evangelical theologian and technologist whose career unfolded inside the volatile ecology of the **internet**, **mobile computing**, and the **platform economy**. His vocational location at **Dallas Theological Seminary** placed him at the junction of **biblical studies**, **ecclesial practice**, and **educational technology**, while his hands-on coding of the **Bible Web App** exposed him to how users actually encounter **Scripture** through screens. Theologically he works from a classic **creation-fall-redemption** schema, read through **Augustinian ambivalence** about culture and a modest **Kuyperian** appreciation of **common grace** in technological craft. Intellectually he situates himself within **media ecology**, citing **Marshall McLuhan** and **Neil Postman** on the formative power of media, while engaging **Jacques Ellul** on the totalizing tendencies of **technique**. Methodologically he refuses both **instrumentalism** the view that tools are neutral and **hard determinism** the view that tools unilaterally determine outcomes, opting instead for a chastened account of **technological mediation** informed by **Don Ihde’s** postphenomenology and the sociology of technology. This blend generates a prac-crit method that alternates between **exegetical theology** and **empirical observation**, an approach that will mature in his later study of **digital Bible** practices.

Dyer’s context includes evangelical debates over **biblical authority** and the flourishing of **digital biblicism**. He observes that the same evangelical emphasis on **Sola Scriptura** that once leveraged the **printing press** now embraces the **Bible app**. The cultural horizon is thus doubly shaped: by the inner grammar of Christian claims about **revelation** and by the outer grammar of media infrastructures that scaffold attention, memory, and social relations. He names these outer pressures as **platform liturgies**, formative patterns of prompt, scroll, search, and share that enact rival tacit catechisms. Dyer’s method aims to render those liturgies theologically visible so that Christian communities can adjudicate them through **wisdom**, **virtue ethics** influenced by **Alasdair MacIntyre**, and the biblical motif of **discernment** testing the spirits.

#### 2. From the Garden to the City: theology of technology
Dyer’s first programmatic statement appears in **From the Garden to the City** 2011, a constructive account of technology framed by **Genesis 1–3**, **Noah** and metals in **Genesis 4**, **Bezalel** and Spirit-filled artistry in **Exodus 31**, and the eschatological **New Jerusalem** in **Revelation 21–22**. He organizes the argument around **imago Dei** and the **cultural mandate** be fruitful, fill, cultivate as grounds for human making while insisting that the **fall** bends technique toward **idolatry** and **domination**. The arc culminates in the **city of God**, where human artifice is not obliterated but purified, echoing **Isaiah 60** and the kings bringing their **glory** into Zion. Within this biblical frame he threads classic media-ecological maxims, most memorably **McLuhan’s** dictum that the **medium is the message** and **Postman’s** warning about **Technopoly**.

A central doctrinal claim in this early work is that technology is best understood neither as a neutral instrument nor as an autonomous fate, but as a complex **moral ecology** that shapes and is shaped by human loves. Dyer deploys **Ellul’s** pessimism selectively, qualifying it with **common grace** and the biblical witness to **Spirit-enabled craftsmanship**. He opens a lexicon of key distinctions: **tools vs techniques**, **making vs magic**, **presence vs telepresence**, **attention vs distraction**, and **embodiment vs virtualization**. Practically he counsels household and church disciplines Sabbath from devices, intentional **liturgy** that resists the logic of speed, and catechesis that names **affordances** and **constraints**. The effect is to translate a sprawling literature on technology into a pastoral, biblically resonant, and widely adoptable theology of practice.

This project also advances a nuanced reading of **imago Dei**, emphasizing creative agency and relational representation while warning against **Prometheanism**. He draws upon **Calvin’s** remarks on artisan gifts and an implicit **Kuyperian** sphere sovereignty to argue that technological vocations fall under divine calling yet remain answerable to the higher norm of **love of God and neighbor**. In short, **From the Garden to the City** establishes Dyer’s enduring thesis: media and tools participate in the formation of persons and communities, thus belonging within the scope of **sanctification** and **practical wisdom**.

#### 3. Between media ecology and biblical hermeneutics
Following the constructive manifesto, Dyer extends his inquiry toward the interface of **media form** and **biblical interpretation**. Here he explores how the **codex**, **chapter-verse numbering**, **concordances**, and now **search boxes** and **hyperlinks** modify the hermeneutical environment. He appropriates insights from **Walter Ong** on **orality and literacy** and from **Kevin Vanhoozer** on **theodramatic** hermeneutics to argue that the way we access Scripture is never merely a delivery mechanism. The medium inculcates tacit habits: **atomization** of verses, preference for **proof-texting**, or conversely, possibilities for **canonical** and **intertextual** discovery not readily available in a linear reading.

This line of thought leads Dyer to coin and analyze a syndrome he labels **digital biblicism**. By this he means a form of zeal for **Bible access** that equates availability and manipulability with comprehension and obedience. In digital biblicism the metric of **streaks**, **highlights**, and **share counts** can be mistaken for **habitus** in the Pauline sense of renewed mind and loves. He is careful, however, to commend the extraordinary gains of **translation distribution**, **low-cost access**, and **searchability**, a manifestation of **common grace** aligned with the missionary imperative. The task is to discern how the **affordances** of the medium tilt practice toward certain theological instincts and away from others, especially in matters of **ecclesiology** and **authority**.

#### 4. People of the Screen: evangelicals and the digital Bible
Dyer’s major scholarly contribution, **People of the Screen** 2023, is best described as a theological ethnography of **evangelical** Bible use that combines **historical narrative**, **qualitative interviews**, and **quantitative analysis**. He recounts how evangelicals were early adopters and architects of digital Scripture projects through institutions like **Bible software companies**, **parachurch ministries**, and seminaries, thereby shaping the very **interfaces** that the global church now inhabits. He tracks the shift from desktop **Bible software** to the ubiquity of the **Bible app**, mapping the migration of authority from print artifacts to **platforms** that algorithmically curate attention, prompt devotional streaks, and gamify spiritual practices.

Two claims anchor the book. First, evangelicals did not simply receive the digital Bible; they actively created it, embedding distinctive values into **design patterns**. Second, the resulting forms have feedback effects on **hermeneutics** and **ecclesial authority**. Features like instant **cross-references**, tappable **original-language glosses**, and social **sharing** lower the threshold for an appearance of expertise, subtly leveling teacher-learner hierarchies while strengthening new **gatekeepers** in platform teams and update cycles. Dyer argues that this reconfigures **trust** and **authority**, making them more transactional and analytics-driven. He supports these claims with user studies that correlate app use patterns with preferences for **topical** versus **canonical** reading and with reported experiences of **presence** or **distraction** in prayer.

Historically, Dyer situates digital Bible innovation within a Protestant lineage that includes the **Gutenberg** revolution, **vernacular translation**, and the democratizing ethos of **Sola Scriptura**. Yet he insists that the new ecologies of **search** and **notification** do more than print ever could to segment attention and to commodify **devotion**. The point is not nostalgia for paper but **theological realism** about how infrastructures carry formative logics. The book thus bridges **media studies**, **practical theology**, and **hermeneutics**, making it a rare contribution that is at once scholarly and pastorally directive.

#### 5. Doctrinal developments and constructive proposals
Across both works Dyer develops a set of doctrinal coordinates for a theology of technology. His treatment of **creation** foregrounds the **imago Dei** as a vocational calling toward culture-making, tempered by **Sabbath** as resistance to the totalizing tempo of **technique**. On the **fall**, he emphasizes **disordered loves** and **idolatry**, reading technological sin as an Augustinian mis-aim of desire rather than primarily as a category error. On **redemption**, he appeals to **sanctification** as the renewal of perception and practice, such that Christians learn to use tools in ways that conduce to **charity**, **justice**, and **truthfulness**. He refuses to collapse eschatology into progress, instead reading the **New Jerusalem** as the transfiguration of human craft by divine glory rather than the triumph of innovation.

Ecclesiologically he argues that digital forms should be subordinated to the **ordinary means of grace**. He cautions against substituting **telepresence** for the bodily acts of **Word and sacrament**, while allowing that digital media can extend, remind, or support the church’s ministries. He introduces the idea of **platform catechesis** intentional formation that names how **notifications**, **feeds**, and **metrics** catechize the heart and proposes counter-liturgies of gathered worship. Educationally he recommends hybridity that integrates **print**, **slow reading**, and **memorization** alongside judicious digital tools, recognizing that the **codex** remains exemplary for deep comprehension even as the **app** excels at discovery and distribution.

#### 6. Interlocutors and critical engagements
Dyer’s consistent dialogue with **Ellul**, **McLuhan**, and **Postman** sets him within the **media ecology** tradition, yet he differentiates himself by his explicit **theological** norming of media analysis. Where **Ellul** tends toward civilizational diagnosis and despair, Dyer retrieves **common grace** and **Spirit-filled artistry**. Where **McLuhan** reads media as extensions without a moral telos, Dyer supplies **teleology** from Scripture’s narrative. He benefits from **Walter Ong’s** orality-literacy contrast while adding a theological lens to the shift from **page** to **screen**. His engagements with **Don Ihde** and **Bruno Latour** are selective, utilizing **mediation** and **actor-network** insights without adopting their metaphysical flattening. Within theology he resonates with **Kuyper** and **Bavinck** on cultural labor, **Augustine** on ordered love, and **Vanhoozer** on the formative power of communicative acts.

He also debates contemporary Christian cultural theory, interacting with **Andy Crouch** on **culture making** and the need for **power** to be exercised as service. With digital critics like **Sherry Turkle** and **Nicholas Carr**, he shares concerns about attention and memory but resists wholesale declinism by emphasizing **practices** and the possibility of redemptive design. The upshot is a chastened but confident **prudence** that invites churches to act as moral communities of use rather than as fatalistic recipients of technological tides.

#### 7. Empirical turn and theological implications
A signal feature of **People of the Screen** is its empirical turn. Dyer conducts surveys, interviews, and interface analyses to trace how **features** shape **habits**. He treats **data** as a descriptive aid for practical theology rather than as a norm for doctrine, using findings to surface pastoral questions: Does search-first reading privilege **systematic topicality** over **narrative canon**. Do streaks and metrics encourage **Pelagian** self-tracking or can they be transposed into communal **accountability**. Does instant access to **Greek and Hebrew** flatten the role of teachers or democratize **exegesis** in a salutary way. Each question returns to the ecclesial task of aligning **practices** with **ends**, a teleological ethics that refuses technophobia and technophilia alike.

Theologically he maintains that the **form of Scripture** as codex, app, or audio is secondary to the **actus purus** of divine self-communication, yet he contends that form mediates uptake. He draws a modest analogy to **sacramentality** not to make media sacraments but to stress that created signs are the ordinary vehicles of **grace** in divine economy. Hence he urges pastors to curate **liturgies** where the public reading and preaching of the **Word** resist the atomizing tendencies of screens, re-situating text within the **people of God** and their practices of prayer, song, and table.

#### 8. Strengths, limits, and emerging questions
Dyer’s synthesis of **biblical theology** and **media ecology** is a rare gift, offering pastors and scholars a grammar for naming how **interfaces** shape **interpretation**. His practical proposals are concrete and church-facing, and his constructive imagination about **technology** at the level of **virtue** and **wisdom** is deeply **Augustinian**. The empirical dimension of **People of the Screen** raises the bar for theological claims about digital life by tying them to observed **practices** rather than to hunches. He presses the evangelical tradition to reckon with the unintended consequences of its own success in building the **digital Bible** ecosystem.

Yet limits remain. The line between description and norm can blur when **data** appear to carry prescriptive force, risking the elevation of **sociology** to an arbiter of **dogmatics**. His invocation of **platform liturgies** powerfully names formation but could more fully interrogate political economy and the **capital** behind platforms, as seen in **surveillance capitalism** and ad-driven infrastructures. The catholic dimension of **tradition** as a check on media drift receives less development than it might, and the theology of **illumination** and **Scripture’s self-attestation** could be more explicit in guarding against a form-content bifurcation. These are not defeaters but invitations to further dogmatic depth.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Dyer’s work is salutary where it reaffirms **common grace**, the **cultural mandate**, and the need for **wisdom** in the use of created means. His insistence that media shape **habitus** aligns with a Reformed account of **catechesis** and with the **antithesis** between the church’s **liturgies** and the world’s rival practices. His cautions about **telepresence** and his prioritizing of gathered **Word and sacrament** resonate with the **ordinary means of grace** and the **regulative principle** guarding corporate worship. The empirical attention to how **Bible apps** alter reading practices helps the Reformed tradition guard **lectio continua**, **covenantal** reading, and the primacy of **preaching** as the Spirit’s ordained instrument.

Points of tension appear where media analysis risks eclipsing the primacy of **revelation** as **self-attesting Scripture**. A Westminster approach would insist that while form shapes reception, the authority, sufficiency, and perspicuity of the **Word** are not contingent on the **app** or **codex**, and that the Spirit’s **illumination** is the decisive agent of understanding. Likewise, while **metrics** may be catechetically harmful, the alternative is not merely better design but a recovery of covenantal **means** instituted by Christ. The Reformed alternative would deepen Dyer’s teleology by rooting digital discernment in **union with Christ**, **law-gospel** distinction guiding the use of exhortation and encouragement in apps, and **church discipline** and **oversight** as communal correctives to platform gatekeeping. In sum, Dyer’s project provides indispensable diagnostics and wise counsel; a Westminster supplement would further anchor those insights in the self-authenticating **Scripture**, the **ordinary means**, and the church’s covenantal structures.
