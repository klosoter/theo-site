### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Steve Schlissel rose to prominence as an urban pastor in Brooklyn, whose ministry at **Messiah’s Congregation** and related outreach initiatives formed the crucible for his theological emphases on **covenant objectivity**, **ecclesial identity**, and **new obedience**. His context was not the academic guild but the pastoral demands of catechizing families, evangelizing immigrants, and sustaining multi-generational Christian faithfulness amid the fragmenting forces of late modernity. In that setting, he appropriated **Cornelius Van Til’s** apologetic insistence on **covenantal antithesis** and the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture**, while resisting what he saw as pietistic individualism and a purely private soteriology. This pastoral frame yielded a method best described as a **covenantal-pastoral hermeneutic**, reading **Deuteronomy**, **Jeremiah 31**, **Romans**, and **1 Corinthians** as canonical instruction to gather, form, warn, and bless a public people under divine oath.

Schlissel’s urban mission produced an instinctively **anti-gnostic** theology that pressed the **goodness of creation**, the **publicity of the church**, and the **physical means of grace**. He insisted that **baptism** and **the Lord’s Supper** are not private tokens of inward states but **covenantal acts** that publicly relocate persons under Christ’s lordship. This made him sympathetic to the **theonomy** of **R. J. Rushdoony** and the liturgical and typological reforms of **James B. Jordan**, though he framed these currents with a pastor’s concern for catechesis and discipline rather than with a political program. The result was a thick, sometimes polemical, **covenant ecclesiology** aligned with **postmillennial** hope, shaped by **Van Til**, and deployed against what he regarded as late-modern Reformed amnesia about the church’s visibility.

#### 2. Entry into the Federal Vision debate
The Auburn Avenue Pastors Conference of 2002 placed Schlissel publicly within the contentious **Federal Vision** conversation alongside **Douglas Wilson**, **John Barach**, and **Steve Wilkins**. His message pressed the theme of **new obedience** within the **better new covenant**, contending that the church must recover the Scriptural grammar by which God binds a people to himself through real covenants that include blessings, curses, means, and responsibilities. In the ensuing volume, **The Federal Vision** (2004), Schlissel’s chapter, **More Than Before, Not Less: The New Covenant Is Better**, argued that **Jeremiah 31** and **Hebrews** teach an elevated, not attenuated, covenant administration. The new covenant exceeds the old in gift and power, and thus, he claimed, the church dare not preach the gospel as if obedience is a legalistic threat to **sola fide**; rather, the reality of **union with Christ** within the covenant summons and equips a people to **new obedience**.

These claims operated within the polemical field carved by **Meredith Kline’s** republication thesis and by a certain strand of **two kingdoms** thinking associated with **Westminster Seminary California**. Schlissel saw the sharp **law-gospel dichotomy** and the insulation of cult from culture as an exegetical and pastoral misstep that evacuated **covenant** of its concrete, communal, sacramental force. He countered that **Romans 6**, **James 2**, and **Matthew 28** authorize ministers to cultivate **baptismal identity** as a real vocation of obedience, not a merely indicative status. This was not a denial of **forensic justification** but an assertion that **forensic grace** creates a public church that does what the King commands.

#### 3. Covenant objectivity, election, and apostasy
The grammar of **covenant objectivity** was central. Schlissel contended that when Scripture speaks of the people as **in the covenant**, it means more than elective possibility. The church is a visible body with real covenant standing, and its members receive **covenantal blessings** that are not mere moral suasion. He appealed to **1 Corinthians 10**, where all Israel was baptized into Moses and all ate the same spiritual food, to argue that the covenant is populated by persons who truly share Christ’s gifts without those gifts being a warrant of **decretal election**. On this view, there is **real apostasy** from the covenant, not a change in God’s secret decree but a fall from publicly held covenant grace. This supplied the pastoral rationale for both robust assurance rooted in the **promissa Dei** and real warnings grounded in **covenant curses**.

Schlissel’s way of distinguishing **covenant membership** from **decretal election** allowed him to interpret passages like **Hebrews 6** and **Hebrews 10** as genuine covenant-history statements rather than hypothetical constructs. The theological payoff was a renewed seriousness about **church discipline**, catechetical formation, and the habitual life of **new obedience**. Critics worried that this grammar blurred the difference between **union with Christ** in the decretal, Spirit-wrought sense and a broader ecclesial union by sign and means. Schlissel insisted the distinction stands, yet he refused to pare back the **efficacy of the means of grace** to accommodate a tighter ordo salutis. The covenant is objective because Christ objectively binds his name to a people by Word, **baptism**, and **Eucharist**.

#### 4. Sacraments, paedocommunion, and liturgy
From covenant objectivity flowed Schlissel’s sacramental claims, especially his support for **paedocommunion** and **covenant renewal worship**. He favored weekly communion and a liturgy shaped by the **call, confession, consecration, communion, commission** pattern advanced in **James B. Jordan’s** work. His argument for **paedocommunion** turned on **1 Corinthians 10** and the Passover’s household structure: if baptized infants are truly in the covenant, then, barring discipline, they belong at the covenant meal. He charged that the Reformed fencing of the table through a verbal self-examination requirement had drifted toward **revivalist subjectivism**. The sacramental signs, he argued, operate as **means of grace** in the covenant, nourishing faith and obedience in keeping with the baptized status of the church’s children.

In his practical theology, the sacraments, **catechesis**, and **family piety** formed a linked ecology. The sacramental life marked the church as a visible polity under Christ; catechesis trained households to live their baptized identity; family piety extended Lord’s Day worship into the week. Schlissel’s polemical target was consumerist worship and therapeutic sermons that naturalize the gospel. The cure, he believed, was a recovered **covenant succession**, whereby parents and elders labor for multi-generational fidelity through means God actually uses. Weekly communion and rich liturgy were not aesthetic upgrades but part of a **covenantal regimen** that produces a different kind of people than the market forms.

#### 5. Law and gospel, justification, and the judgment according to works
Schlissel’s sharpest disputes concerned **law and gospel** as a doctrinal distinction and its relation to **justification by faith alone**. He did not deny the distinction as such; he opposed its use as a controlling hermeneutic that suspends **imperatives** from the fabric of the gospel. He insisted that the **third use of the law** is baked into the covenantal form of redemption, so that **new obedience** is not an optional addendum but part of the gospel’s telos. The cross grants the pardon that inaugurates a Spirit-empowered life in which the church advances in holiness as a corporate body. In this register, he often appealed to **James 2** and the biblical teaching on a **future judgment according to works** to underwrite the seriousness of sanctification.

To guard **sola fide**, Schlissel spoke of **forensic justification** as definitive and non-meritorious, while speaking of works as the Spirit’s fruit that will be evaluated in the final assize. The vector of his thought emphasized the covenantal matrix: the justified are those baptized into a community called to bear fruit, and the integrity of that calling is maintained through real warnings and promises. Critics from **Westminster Seminary California** worried that such language introduced a second instrument into justification or collapsed **ordo salutis** into **historia salutis**. Schlissel replied that a Pauline reading that keeps Ephesians 2 and Matthew 25 together is hardly innovative; the novelty sits with any schema that renders the church’s obedience a mere epiphenomenon of forensic grace.

#### 6. Culture, mission, and one-kingdom claims
In urban work and beyond, Schlissel pursued a **one-kingdom** or **Kuyperian** affirmation that **Christ’s lordship** extends unfragmentedly over church and world. He was wary of contemporary **two kingdoms** proposals that, in his judgment, created a practical dualism between sacred and secular vocations. With **postmillennial** confidence, he urged Christians to receive the **Great Commission** as a mandate to disciple nations through Word and sacrament, confident that real cultural fruit follows real ecclesial faithfulness. His critiques of **church-growth pragmatism** and **seeker-sensitivity** were not merely aesthetic but theological: the covenant defines the church’s means and aims, and those means are sufficient for mission. The attractional turn, on his account, undercuts **means of grace** and therefore hollows out the church’s life.

Theologically, this posture reinforced his **anti-gnostic creation affirmation**. The **Sabbath**, the **body**, the **household economy**, and **public justice** were not secular matters temporarily tolerated but media for sanctified obedience. The result was a principled resistance to privatized piety, a corresponding embrace of Christian education and diaconal work, and a call for churches to preach the **whole counsel of God** without apology. Here Schlissel’s affinities with **theonomy** were clear, while his pastoral rhetoric leaned toward persuading churches to become thickly biblical communities rather than offering a blueprint for civil policy.

#### 7. Interlocutors, controversies, and confessional responses
Schlissel’s public alignment with the **Federal Vision** drew intense scrutiny from **PCA**, **OPC**, and **URCNA** committees between 2002 and 2007. Denominational reports expressed concern about the movement’s language of **covenant objectivity**, **baptismal efficacy**, **final justification according to works**, and **paedocommunion**. Writers like **Guy Prentiss Waters** cataloged perceived departures from confessional norms, while voices such as **R. Scott Clark** and **Michael Horton** mounted broader theological critiques from the vantage of **Reformed confessionalism** and **law-gospel** grammar. Schlissel interacted by way of addresses, newsletters, and the **Joint Federal Vision Statement** of 2007, which sought to clarify and restrain ambiguities while maintaining the pastoral thrust toward **new obedience** and **sacramental realism**.

The most persistent tension was the relation of **covenant and election**. Critics alleged that in practice, if not intention, covenant status was being merged with decretal union. Schlissel routinely answered with a two-layer account: the covenant is a divinely established administration with real gifts and real liabilities for its public members, while election is God’s secret and effectual grace ensuring perseverance. That distinction allowed him to preach both assurance and warning and to defend a meaningful **doctrine of apostasy** within the covenant without implying mutability in God. Whether this grammar preserved classical distinctions or relocated them remained the contested point.

#### 8. Major themes consolidated
Across his ministry, Schlissel’s project consolidated around several themes. First, the **superiority of the new covenant** is not a reduction of Old Testament concreteness but an increase in **Spirit-given efficacy**, which grounds the church’s confidence in **word and sacrament**. Second, the **objectivity of the covenant** entails that the church’s children are really of the household and should be treated as such in teaching, discipline, and often in **communion**. Third, the **means of grace** do what God says they do, creating a public, not merely inward, people. Fourth, **law and gospel** must not be prised apart so that obedience appears as a threat to grace; rather, **new obedience** is grace’s fruit and the covenant’s design. Fifth, the church’s mission is both doxological and cultural in scope, fitting **one-kingdom** allegiance to Christ and nurturing **postmillennial** hope that nations can be discipled through ordinary ministry.

These themes were never offered as a novelty isolated from tradition; Schlissel claimed alignment with **Calvin’s** stress on the **church’s visibility**, the **Heidelberg Catechism** on gratitude and obedience, and **Westminster** on the **third use of the law**. Yet his formulations also pressed beyond common twentieth-century Anglo-American Reformed habits by insisting, sympathetically with **James B. Jordan** and **Peter Leithart**, on typological reading, liturgical renewal, and robust ecclesial identity. The pastoral texture of his work kept the doctrinal debates tethered to questions about how to preach **baptismal identity**, how to fence the table, how to form children, and how to discipline covenant members with clarity and hope.

In sum, Schlissel should be read as a pastor-theologian whose public significance came through the **Federal Vision** controversy but whose deeper contribution lay in a sustained, local argument for **covenantal ecclesiology**, **sacramental practice**, and **new obedience** as the ordinary means by which God maintains a people in Christ.

Finally, a Reformed and WTS evaluation. In Reformed terms, Schlissel’s insistence on **church visibility**, **means of grace**, and the **third use of the law** is salutary, especially against evangelical individualism and voluntarism. His urban, anti-gnostic emphasis on **creation’s goodness** and on **household catechesis** rightly challenges therapeutic and consumerist ecclesial models. Yet from a **Westminster Standards** and **WTS** perspective, several tensions remain. First, the rhetoric of **covenant objectivity** sometimes compresses the distance between **sacramental union** and **decretal union**, risking confusion about the nature of **union with Christ** and the ground of perseverance. Second, the integration of **future judgment according to works** with present justification can be stated so strongly that the material clarity of **sola fide** is obscured, even if formally affirmed. Third, advocacy of **paedocommunion** strains the Standards’ catechetical and pastoral rationale for communicant self-examination and threatens the confessional ordering of **baptism**, **catechesis**, and **communion**. Fourth, the **one-kingdom** push and theonomic sympathies can muddy the distinct yet coordinate claims of **special revelation** and **natural law** for common civic life. A constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy would retain Schlissel’s anti-gnostic ecclesial heft and sacramental seriousness while sharpening the classic distinctions between **covenant and election**, **sign and thing signified**, and **justification and sanctification**, so that the church’s **new obedience** is preached as the Spirit’s grateful fruit of a free and definitive **forensic righteousness** in Christ.
