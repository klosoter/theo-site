### ESSAY
Stephen J. Wellum has emerged as a leading voice in contemporary evangelical theology by articulating an intentionally canonical and christocentric proposal known as **progressive covenantalism**. Teaching at the **Southern Baptist Theological Seminary** within a postwar evangelical renaissance of **biblical theology**, he writes against the background of long-running North American debates between **dispensationalism** and **covenant theology**. Trained in a milieu marked by **D. A. Carson**, **Kevin Vanhoozer**, and the resurgent concern for **sola Scriptura** and **tota Scriptura**, Wellum seeks to recover how the one plan of God unfolds by **kingdom through covenant**. His horizons are unapologetically canonical and catholic in scope, yet they remain evangelically chastened by the authority of Scripture, the grammar of the **ecumenical creeds**, and a Reformation-shaped account of **grace and revelation**. The animating conviction is that Scripture’s own **diatheke** structure supplies the architectonic logic by which doctrines of **Christ**, **salvation**, and **the church** are rightly ordered.

Methodologically, Wellum argues for an integration of **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** in which the former provides the covenantal storyline and the latter renders dogmatic judgments under the rule of the **analogia fidei**. He consistently resists both atomistic proof-texting and a free-floating dogmatics by insisting on a canonical sequence governed by **progressive revelation**, **typology**, and **eschatological fulfillment in Christ**. This amounts to what might be called a modest **critical realism** in hermeneutics, convinced that the text communicates determinate meaning, yet recognizes the *historia salutis* movement from **Adam** to **Abraham** to **Moses** to **David** to **Christ**. For Wellum, typology is not allegory but **covenantally embedded correspondence**, grounded in divine authorship and the unity of **redemptive history**. The payoff is that doctrines like **incarnation**, **atonement**, and **ecclesiology** are not superimposed upon the text but generated by the text’s own covenantal architecture.

The flagship project is **Kingdom through Covenant, 2012**, coauthored with **Peter J. Gentry** and substantially revised in **2018**. That work contends that the Bible’s central plotline is the establishment of God’s **kingdom through covenantal administrations**, each adding clarity and pressure toward the climactic **new covenant in Christ**. The **Abrahamic covenant** announces universal blessing through a particular family, the **Mosaic law-covenant** constitutes Israel as a priestly nation within a typological land, the **Davidic covenant** tightens the royal thread, and the **new covenant** fulfills and transforms each prior layer in the crucified and risen **Messiah**. Gentry’s linguistic and compositional analysis supports Wellum’s canonical judgments, especially on the nature of **berith** and **diatheke**, and on the way **temple, land, and sonship** ascend as typological patterns. Against classical **dispensationalism**, the book affirms one people of God and one plan centered on Christ. Against traditional **covenant theology**, it resists collapsing the covenants into a single **covenant of grace** such that the pre-Christ administrations function as essentially the same order as the **new covenant**.

Building on that thesis, the edited volume **Progressive Covenantalism, 2016**, coedited with **Brent E. Parker**, clarifies the platform by engaging hermeneutics, law, and ecclesiology. The label **progressive** signals epochal development under divine guidance, while **covenantalism** signals that the covenants are the key structuring device, not mere narrative wallpaper. Contributors interact with **progressive dispensationalism** associated with **Bock** and **Blaising**, commending its recognition of inaugurated eschatology yet indicting its two-peoples residue. They also debate with **Reformed paedobaptist** versions of **covenant theology**, affirming a rich continuity in promise and typology but disputing how **circumcision** relates to **baptism** and whether **Jeremiah 31** allows unregenerate membership in the **new covenant**. The upshot is a third way that claims full-orbed canonical continuity in Christ, yet a decisive newness at the level of **covenant membership** and **signs**.

A central dogmatic fruit of Wellum’s proposal is a reconfigured **new covenant ecclesiology** tied to **credobaptism**. Reading **Jeremiah 31**, **Ezekiel 36**, and **Hebrews 8 to 10**, he argues that new covenant members are defined by **regeneration**, **forgiveness**, and **Spirit indwelling**, which in turn norm the identity and boundaries of the **church**. The church is not a mixed community constituted by natural descent but a regenerate community gathered by **faith union with Christ** signified in **baptism** and nourished in **the Supper**. On this reading, **circumcision** functioned as a typological sign of a genealogical and national covenant unique to Israel’s **theocracy**, whereas **baptism** signifies participation in the crucified and risen **Lord** and is therefore for believers. This leads to decisive positions on the **Israel-church relation**, treating the church as the **eschatological Israel** rather than a parenthesis or a mere administrative form of the same covenant. It also yields judgments on the **land promise** as typologically escalated to the **new creation**, modifying political readings of modern Israel and sharpening **mission** as worldwide witness to the **kingdom**.

Alongside this covenantal platform, Wellum has produced major work in **Christology** and **soteriology**. In **God the Son Incarnate, 2016**, he defends the biblical and classical doctrine of Christ by retrieving **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** grammar, particularly the **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** distinction, the **hypostatic union**, and the **communicatio idiomatum** properly construed. He shows how the covenantal storyline demands a fully divine and fully human mediator, a **son of David** and **Lord** whose two-natures unity grounds the work of redemption. He is deliberate in rebutting modern reductions of Christology found in **kenotic theories**, **Adoptionism**, and hermeneutical moves that detach the canonical **kyrios** from the God of **Israel**. In **Christ Alone, 2017**, he extends Christology to soteriological exclusivity, arguing for **solus Christus** and the finality of Christ against **pluralism** and **inclusivism**. Here he couples a robust **penal substitution** account of the cross with the **munus triplex** to frame Christ’s unique mediatorship, contending that no other name under heaven saves because no other covenantal representative fulfills the Scriptures.

Wellum’s soteriology shows the same covenantal and Christological center. Using the grammar of **union with Christ**, he locates **justification** in forensic imputation anchored in Christ’s obedience and cross, while also insisting that the **new covenant** brings **new-creational transformation** by the Spirit. He engages the **New Perspective on Paul**, welcoming its attention to salvation-historical context while rejecting any collapse of **imputation** or **propitiation** into sociological boundary markers. His atonement theology aligns with the evangelical and Reformed tradition on **penal substitution** and often gestures toward **definite atonement** in terms of covenantal representation, though he keeps the emphasis on the sufficiency and efficacy of Christ’s work within the **covenantal headship** of the new Adam. Throughout, he prioritizes the Augustinian insight that grace is not an external aid but God’s effective gift in Christ, applied by the **Spirit** to the elect through the **word**.

Interlocutors are ubiquitous in Wellum’s corpus, and the argument is sharpened by dialogue. With **progressive dispensationalism** he shares an inaugurated **kingdom** but faults its ongoing distinction of Israel and church in the eschaton. With **classic Reformed covenant theology** he shares a high view of **Scripture**, **Christology**, and **atonement**, yet he disputes the trans-temporal **covenant of grace** as the best explanatory category, preferring discrete covenants coordinated to Christ’s fulfillment. He engages **Meredith Kline** appreciatively on **intrusion ethics**, **typological kingdom**, and the proleptic structure of the **Mosaic economy**, yet rejects the inference that covenant signs extend to the children of believers in the new covenant. He also converses with **N. T. Wright** and others on **justification** and **kingdom**, appropriating insights on exile and return while defending **imputation** and the cross as **penal substitution**. In hermeneutics his affinities with **Vanhoozer** and **Carson** are clear, especially the commitment to a textually governed **typology** rather than a reader-generated figuration.

Reception has been vigorous. The 2018 revision of **Kingdom through Covenant** sharpened exegesis of texts such as **Genesis 15 and 17**, **2 Samuel 7**, and **Hebrews**, clarified the relation of **law and gospel**, and responded to both **paedobaptist** and **dispensational** critiques. The edited **Progressive Covenantalism** volume gathered a cohort to apply the paradigm to **ethics**, **law**, and **ecclesiology**, displaying that the model can do more than parse covenants in abstraction. Critics from the Reformed side worry that Wellum’s rejection of the singular **covenant of grace** undercuts a long-standing way of safeguarding **one way of salvation** and a robust **sacramental** account of the **visible church**. Dispensational critics suggest that his typological escalation undercuts promises to **ethnic Israel**. Wellum replies that one plan of salvation is preserved in the one **mediator** and his one **new covenant**, that the **visible-invisible** church distinction is retained but reordered by **regeneration**, and that Israel’s promises are fulfilled without remainder in the **Messiah** and his **new creation**.

Theologically, Wellum’s constructive contribution is best summarized as a canonical christocentrism disciplined by covenantal architecture, then extended to a regenerate-church ecclesiology. The strength of **progressive covenantalism** lies in its textual pressure, forcing interpreters to account for the actual structure and sequence of **Scripture’s covenants**, the theocratic uniqueness of **old covenant Israel**, and the promised qualitative newness of **Jeremiah 31**. By binding **ecclesiology**, **soteriology**, and **sacramentology** to the **new covenant**, Wellum attempts to retrieve the early evangelical and Baptistic insistence on the church as a community of **confession and conversion** while avoiding the pitfalls of **restorationism** or anti-confessionalism. His work on **Christology** secures the dogmatic center such that the covenantal plotline culminates in a fully orthodox **God-man**, ensuring that hermeneutics do not outrun dogma and dogma does not float free of **exegesis**.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary readers will find much to commend in Wellum’s high **doctrine of Scripture**, **Chalcedonian Christology**, **penal substitution**, and his typological reading that resonates with **Vosian biblical theology**. The constructive tension arises at the level of **covenant theology**, especially the denial that a single **covenant of grace** unites the administrations and the consequent restriction of **covenant membership** in the **new covenant** to the regenerate. Classic Reformed theology maintains one covenant of grace under multiple administrations to explain continuity of **promises**, **people**, and **means of grace**, grounding **paedobaptism** and a robust **visible church** whose mixed character is acknowledged by **Westminster Confession 25 and 27**. Wellum’s model offers a clear account of **new covenant newness** and a tighter link between **sign and thing signified**, yet may strain the Reformed distinction between **substance and administration** of the covenant and risk conflating the eschatological ideal with the pilgrim church’s empirical life. A Westminster alternative would retain Wellum’s covenantal typology and Christological telos while reasserting the one **covenant of grace** across administrations, maintaining **baptism for believers and their children** as a sign of entry into the visible people of God, and preserving the two-ages tension in ecclesial practice. Even so, on essentials of **revelation**, **grace**, **Christ**, and **atonement**, Wellum stands close to Reformed orthodoxy, pressing the conversation with exegetical rigor and a canonical vision that continues to refine evangelical dogmatics.
