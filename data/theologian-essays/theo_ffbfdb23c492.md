### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Gilles Emery, O.P., is a Swiss Dominican theologian whose mature work since the 1990s has re-centered contemporary **trinitarian theology** around the grammar of **Thomas Aquinas**. Trained at the **University of Fribourg** and formed within the Dominican tradition shaped by **Jean-Pierre Torrell** and the broader **ressourcement** recovery of patristic and medieval sources, Emery situates his project in the post–Vatican II climate where **Rahner**, **Balthasar**, and social **trinitarianism** set the agenda. Against programmatic novelty, Emery advances a patient **textual Thomism** that interrogates the *Summa theologiae* and related works for the inner logic of **divine simplicity**, **processions**, and **missions**. His leitmotif is that speculative clarity and spiritual contemplation belong together in **sacra doctrina**, where the biblical confession of the **Triune God** is articulated through analogical concepts under creaturely conditions of knowing.

Methodologically Emery retrieves the Thomistic hermeneutic of **analogia entis** alongside the **via remotionis** and **via eminentiae**, insisting that we name God truthfully yet analogically. He reads **Aquinas** as a scriptural theologian whose metaphysics arises from the economy of revelation, so that the eternal **processions ad intra** ground the temporal **missions ad extra**, and **inseparable operations** safeguard the unity of the one divine **actus purus**. In his hands, *notiones personales* and **relations of origin** become the scaffolding that unites exegesis and metaphysics, resisting both historicist reduction and abstraction detached from salvation history. This method defines his major works and orients his engagements with **Rahner's rule**, **Barth's** critique of the **analogia entis**, and the East–West debates around **de Régnon's** contested thesis.

#### 2. Key works and the consolidation of a Thomist program
Emery's first monograph, **La Trinité créatrice** 1995, established his conviction that creation is intelligible only within a robust **trinitarian metaphysics**. The book argues that the Thomistic account of **exitus-reditus** integrates **creation**, **providence**, and **grace** into the eternal life of **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**, without dissolving the Creator-creature distinction under **divine simplicity**. Later, **The Trinitarian Theology of St Thomas Aquinas** 2007 distilled decades of scholarship into a sustained exposition of **Aquinas's** trinitarian loci: **processions** as intellectual and volitional acts, **personal relations** as subsisting, **innascibilitas** as a quasi-notion of the Father, **spiratio** in the **filioque**, and the exemplary relation of **missions** to sanctification. His companion volume, **The Trinity: An Introduction to Catholic Doctrine on the Triune God** 2011, renders the same grammar catechetically, showing how appropriations of **power** to the Father, **wisdom** to the Son, and **love** to the Spirit are pedagogical instruments subordinate to **personal properties**.

As co-editor with **Matthew Levering** of the **Oxford Handbook of the Trinity** 2011, Emery helped map the field, situating **Aquinas** among **Augustine**, **Cappadocians**, medievals, and moderns such as **Rahner**, **Barth**, and **Balthasar**. His collected studies, **Trinity, Church, and the Human Person** 2012, extend the trinitarian grammar into ecclesiology and theological anthropology, arguing that the **imago Dei** and the communion of the **Church** are indexed to the missions of **Word** and **Spirit**. Across these works the same profile emerges: Thomistic retrieval pursued through precise historical exegesis, metaphysical rigor under **divine simplicity**, and pervasive attention to the structure of **missions**.

#### 3. Processions, relations, and persons in God
At the doctrinal core of Emery's project lies a lucid rehearsal of **Aquinas's** logic of **processions and relations**. Following **Augustine's** *De Trinitate*, he specifies two **processions ad intra** in God: from the principle of **intellect** arises the **Verbum** or **Word** identified with the **Son**; from the principle of **will** arises **Love** identified with the **Holy Spirit**. These processional acts ground the **personal relations** of **paternity and filiation** on the one hand, and **active and passive spiration** on the other, where only relations of opposition constitute **persons** as subsisting **relations of origin**. Within **divine simplicity**, there is no composition of substance and accident, yet the real relations, identical with the one **essence**, are relatively opposed and so irreducibly personal. Emery presses this Thomistic paradox against both unitarian essentialism and tritheistic social models: it is precisely **simplicity** that secures personal distinction, and precisely personal **relationality** that unfolds the simplicity of **ipsum esse subsistens**.

This Thomist grammar then explicates **personal names** and **appropriations**. For Emery, **personal properties** such as **paternity** are constitutive, while **appropriations** are pedagogical assignments of common **essential attributes** to a person in order to manifest real personal characteristics. Thus **wisdom** is appropriated to the **Son** in view of the **Word**, and **love** to the **Spirit** in view of **spiratio**, without collapsing appropriations into personal properties. The payoff is conceptual discipline: in exegesis and dogmatics alike, talk of divine **power**, **wisdom**, and **love** must not blur the distinction between **essential attributes** and **personal relations**, a distinction that, for Emery, is the scaffold of orthodox **trinitarianism**.

#### 4. Missions and the economy of salvation
Emery's most fruitful retrieval may be his sustained account of **missions ad extra** grounded in **processions ad intra**. He argues that for **Aquinas** the temporal mission of a divine person is the new mode of presence of that person in a creature through **grace**, presupposing but not identical with the person's eternal **procession**. The **incarnation** is the visible mission of the **Son**, and the **gift of the Spirit** in sanctification constitutes his mostly invisible mission. Missions are recognized by their termini: the visible humanity of Christ and the invisible **indwelling** of the **Word** and **Love** through **faith** and **charity**. Under the axiom of **inseparable operations**, missions never divide the external works of the Trinity; yet the missions manifest and are ordered to the personal **relations of origin**.

This linking of missions to processions allows Emery to refine **Rahner's rule** that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity and vice versa. He affirms the rule as a prophylactic against speculative detachment, yet insists that the economy reveals without exhausting the immanent life. The visible and invisible **missions** are intelligible only because they are effects of eternal **processions**, and the **inseparability** of divine action preserves monotheism as the missions differentiate the personal **presence** of **Son** and **Spirit**. Here Emery thinks he avoids both a mere economy-only approach and an abstract immanentism, precisely by explicating **Aquinas's** organism of **notions**, **relations**, and **missions**.

#### 5. Filioque and the Holy Spirit as Love
Emery offers one of the most careful contemporary defenses of the **filioque** within a Thomistic framework. Exploiting **Aquinas's** technical distinctions, he argues that the Holy Spirit proceeds from the **Father and the Son** as from one principle through a single **spiratio**, because the **Word** and the **Love** are internal processions grounded in the same simple essence. The **Son's** involvement in the **spiration** of the Spirit does not subordinate the Spirit, since the principle is the Father with the Son as one cause, and the relation of the Spirit is **passive spiration** relative to this single principle. Against certain readings of **de Régnon** that pit a supposed Eastern personalism against a Western essentialism, Emery shows that **Aquinas** integrates **personal relations** and **simplicity** so that the Latin **filioque** secures the reciprocity of personal communion.

This Thomistic pneumatology converges with his account of **charity**. For **Aquinas**, the Holy Spirit is **Love** as the subsistent term of the divine will's act; the created habit of charity in us is an effect of the Spirit's **mission** and so a participation in uncreated **Love**. Emery presses this line to articulate how sanctification is indexed to the **Spirit's** personal identity without confusing **created grace** with the **uncreated Gift**. Within **missions**, the Spirit's coming is recognized by the effect of **charity**, just as the **Son's** mission is recognized by **wisdom** and **faith**. The result is a coherent mapping of spiritual life onto trinitarian personal grammar, an outcome that characterizes Emery's larger sacramental and ecclesial reflections.

#### 6. Divine names, simplicity, and biblical exegesis
Throughout his corpus, Emery maintains that the doctrine of **divine simplicity** is not an obstacle but the enabling condition of **trinitarian confession**. Drawing on the **analogia entis**, he defends analogical predication of **divine names**, warning against both univocity that collapses Creator and creature and equivocity that undermines theological knowledge. The **via remotionis** removes creaturely limitations, the **via eminentiae** amplifies perfection, and the **via causalitatis** reads the traces of God in creation; together they frame scriptural naming of **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**. Within this framework **appropriation** functions as exegetical discipline: the **power** of creation is read as the work of the one God appropriated to the **Father**, the **wisdom** of redemption to the **Son**, and the **love** of sanctification to the **Spirit**, while maintaining **inseparable operations** and guarding **personal properties**.

Emery thus rejects the dichotomy between metaphysics and exegesis. He reads **Aquinas** as a theologian of Scripture whose metaphysical judgments arise within **sacra doctrina** as a habitus ordered to blessedness. The scriptural **narrative** of the economy is not bypassed but clarified by the metaphysical grammar of **processions**, **relations**, and **missions**. This conviction underwrites his critique of certain forms of **social trinitarianism** that prioritize relational models abstracted from doctrine, and also informs his measured appropriation of **Rahner**, **Balthasar**, and **Zizioulas**, where he receives insights yet resists reconfigurations that would unsettle **simplicity** or **inseparable operations**.

#### 7. Ecclesial and anthropological extensions
While best known for trinitarian loci, Emery also extends Thomistic insights to **ecclesiology** and **anthropology**, particularly in **Trinity, Church, and the Human Person** 2012. He reads the **imago Dei** of Genesis as a dynamic participation in the **Word** and **Love**, so that rational nature is ordered to God by **knowledge** and **charity** that mirror the **Son** and **Spirit**. The **Church** is thereby construed as the locus of the **missions** through the Word proclaimed and the **sacramental** gift of the Spirit, a communion whose unity images the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity while preserving personal differentiation. In this framework **deification** or *participatio divinae naturae* is not absorption but heightened **participation** under the Creator-creature distinction secured by **divine simplicity**.

These extensions also illuminate **Christology** and grace. The **incarnation** as the visible **mission** of the **Son** grounds the Church's unity and the believer's conformity to Christ; the **Spirit's** gift as uncreated **Love** grounds **charity** and the ecclesial bond of peace. Emery insists that **created grace** is the fruit of the **missions**, relationally indexing sanctification to the **Trinitarian persons**, even as the efficient cause remains the one **God** whose action is inseparably triune. The anthropological and ecclesial corollaries of this grammar further demonstrate how for Emery **Aquinas's** trinitarianism is not a speculative enclave but the key to a coherent dogmatic system.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: Rahner, Barth, and the de Régnon thesis
Emery's engagements with the moderns are both appreciative and critical. With **Rahner**, he agrees that the **economic Trinity** is the site of revelation for the **immanent Trinity**, yet Emery insists, against certain receptions of **Rahner's rule**, that the doctrinal content of **processions** and **relations** is not a projection from economy but a revealed grammar necessary to read the economy rightly. With **Barth**, he shares the Christological concentration of revelation, but he resists **Barth's** categorical rejection of the **analogia entis**, arguing that **Aquinas's** analogical naming is a discipline of confession, not a natural theology that bypasses Christ. On the historiographical front, he is critical of **de Régnon's** dichotomizing narrative that caricatures the Latin focus on **unity** versus Eastern focus on **person**; Emery shows from **Aquinas** that **simplicity** and **personal relations** are co-constitutive, a point that also reframes the debate over the **filioque**.

Emery also interacts with recent **social trinitarianisms** such as **Zizioulas**, and with metaphysical critiques by analytic philosophers. While he does not fully enter analytic **perfect being** debates, his exposition of **simplicity**, **relations**, and **missions** offers resources to rebut charges of modal collapse or personal eclipse. By attending to **oppositions of relation** within a simple essence, and by clarifying the **termini** of **missions**, he safeguards personal distinctions without fragmenting the divine **operation**. This set of engagements situates Emery as a constructive traditionalist: not an innovator by design, but a resourceful interpreter whose Thomistic clarity recalibrates contemporary dogmatics.

#### 9. Contribution and influence
The distinctive contribution of Gilles Emery is to have shown that a fully historical and biblically attuned **trinitarian theology** can be recovered by listening carefully to **Aquinas's** conceptual music. His synthesis of **divine simplicity**, **processions**, **relations**, **appropriations**, **missions**, **inseparable operations**, and **filioque** furnishes a coherent grammar that illuminates Scripture, doctrine, and spiritual life. As co-editor of the **Oxford Handbook of the Trinity** 2011 he has shaped a generation of scholarship by mapping debates and recovering neglected medieval insights. Through **The Trinitarian Theology of St Thomas Aquinas** 2007 and **The Trinity: An Introduction** 2011 he has offered both specialists and students a reliable guide to **Aquinas**, one that avoids both modern reductionism and nostalgic repristination.

In sum, Emery represents a rigorous **Thomist ressourcement** that has become a benchmark for Catholic and ecumenical dogmatics. His work has influenced contemporary **Dominicans**, engaged **Catholic systematicians** like **Levering** and **Thomas Joseph White**, and provided a counterweight to **social trinitarianism**. By insisting that **missions** are the economic face of **processions**, he secures a path where speculative theology remains tethered to salvation history, and where spiritual theology rests on dogmatic precision.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage, including Westminster Theological Seminary's confessional instincts, Emery's retrieval is a powerful ally on the **doctrine of God**. His defense of **divine simplicity**, **inseparable operations**, **relations of origin**, and the **filioque** coheres with the Reformed scholastic inheritance of **Turretin** and **Voetius**, while his account of **missions** offers conceptual help for reading the **economy** without dissolving the **immanent Trinity**. His careful differentiation of **appropriations** from **personal properties** limits speculative flights and aids biblical exegesis. Yet tensions remain in principle. First, his explicit appeal to the **analogia entis** and metaphysical naming of God will be met by the Reformed emphasis on **revelation** as covenantal and redemptive-historical, wary of the extension of metaphysical reasons beyond the norm of **Scripture** and the **analogia fidei**. Second, his use of **created grace** as the formal effect of **missions** can appear, to Reformed ears, to reify grace as a habit rather than to center grace as the **favor Dei** in **covenant** with the elect, jeopardizing the evangelical accent on **union with Christ** as the fountain of all benefits. Third, the broader **nature-grace** schema presupposed by Thomism, even in its Christocentric form, sits uneasily with a Reformed ordering of **creation and covenant** where **special revelation** governs all theological predication. The Reformed alternative would be to affirm with Emery the **simplicity** and **missions-processions** nexus, appropriating his dogmatic grammar, while re-grounding **analogy**, **grace**, and **participation** within the triune economy of the **covenant of grace**, ensuring that metaphysical speech is normed strictly by redemptive history and the **Christological** center of Scripture.
