### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Context, and Method
Michael LeFebvre is a **contemporary Reformed** pastor-scholar whose work inhabits the crossroads of **biblical law**, **calendar studies**, and **creation theology**. Educated to the doctoral level in Old Testament, culminating in a dissertation published as **Collections, Codes, and Torah** in 2006, he operates as both minister and academic voice in the **Presbyterian Church in America** and as an affiliated teacher in venues like the **Theopolis Institute**. The historical moment of his work is significant: late modern debates over **Pentateuchal composition**, **ANE legal parallels**, and intra-evangelical controversies on **creation days** have required nuanced accounts of genre, canon, and doctrine. LeFebvre reads **Torah** as Scripture in ecclesia, yet with unembarrassed attention to **comparative Ancient Near Eastern** data, aligning a confessional **Sola Scriptura** with careful *ad fontes* philology and legal anthropology. The result is a methodological posture that honors **canonical form**, treats **law collections** as historically embedded and rhetorically shaped, and reads **Genesis** and **Leviticus** from within the lived **liturgical calendar** of Israel.

LeFebvre’s epistemic stance is resolutely **catholic Reformed**: Scripture’s authority is primary, but God has not revealed his will in a vacuum, so **genre** and **social function** matter. Theologically, this is the logic of *accommodatio* and **covenant**: God addresses Israel’s life with forms meaningful to Israel’s polity and worship. Thus he frames the **Torah** not as an abstract code but as a pedagogical corpus, a social catechism of justice ordered in ritual time. He frequently employs the binary **law collections versus legislation** to capture this distinction. Without dismissing jurisprudence, he argues that **legal texts** in the Pentateuch function more as **instructional exempla** that shape communal memory and moral imagination than as exhaustive statutory **regulation** for courts, a claim he coordinates with ANE scholarship from figures like **Raymond Westbrook** and **Bernard S. Jackson**.

#### 2. Torah as Civic Liturgy: Collections, Codes, and Torah (2006; 2013)
The crux of **Collections, Codes, and Torah** is a re-description: Israel’s written laws resemble ANE **law collections** that functioned didactically, not civic **legislation** in the positivist sense. In this argument, LeFebvre joins and extends insights from **Westbrook** on Mesopotamian law and **Jackson** on semiotics of legal texts. Ancient collections like the **Code of Hammurabi** are best read as royal wisdom, exemplifying *ius* the just order rather than promulgating *lex* enforceable statute. On this reading, the **Covenant Code** of **Exodus 20–23**, the **Holiness Code** of **Leviticus 17–26**, and **Deuteronomy** are curated exempla of justice and holiness for Israel’s corporate catechesis. He appeals to Deuteronomy’s own rhetoric in **Deut 6–11** and **Deut 16–18**, where **Torah** is bound on hands and doorframes, taught in homes, and recited at feasts; in other words, it is integrated into a **civic calendar**.

What then of courts and kings in Israel? LeFebvre does not deny adjudication or royal responsibility, but he shifts gravity from legislation to **wisdom jurisprudence**. Elders reckon with cases in light of **Torah’s exempla** and in the presence of God’s people shaped by the **festal calendar** of **Passover**, **Weeks**, and **Booths**, culminating in **Sabbath**. The law collections serve canonically as a **moral pedagogy** in time. This socio-liturgical location addresses historical puzzles: why do some Pentateuchal stipulations seem ideal or paradigmatic rather than procedurally precise; how do we coordinate divergent case laws across **Exodus**, **Leviticus**, and **Deuteronomy**; why the close alignment of law with **covenant oaths** and **festival readings**. For LeFebvre, the answer is that these texts are gathered to be heard in assembly, sung and memorized, and thus to form a **people of justice**.

The constructive pay-off for **Reformed theology** is immediate. The **Westminster Confession** affirms that the **judicial laws** expired except for their **general equity**. LeFebvre supplies a historical rationale for that very category: if Torah’s **judicial texts** aim at inculcating the **equity** of God’s righteous ways rather than constructing a codebook, then the church’s task is to read these **collections** canonically to discern **wisdom**, not to reconstruct a theocratic statute-book. This honors the threefold use of the law without collapsing it into either legalism or antinomianism. By embedding **justice** in **liturgy** and **calendar**, he also links the moral vision of Israel to the rhythms of **Sabbath** and **Jubilee**, instructing the church to think about economics, mercy, and rest within a **sacred time** pedagogy rather than only within abstract ethical casuistry.

#### 3. The Liturgy of Creation: Creation as Calendar (2019)
The later monograph, **The Liturgy of Creation**, applies the same genre-sensitive and liturgical method to **Genesis 1**. LeFebvre’s thesis is not a novelty for novelty’s sake; rather, it is an exegetical contention rooted in the text’s own vocabulary of **seasons**, **days**, and **years** in **Genesis 1:14**. The production of lights is described as for **signs** and for **moedim** appointed times, the very word elsewhere used for Israel’s **festivals**. On this basis, LeFebvre contends that the seven-day sequence functions as a **civic calendar** narrative, an instructional device to order Israel’s time toward **Sabbath** rest. It is therefore a **liturgy of creation**, catechizing a redeemed people to inhabit God’s sanctified time. The **Sabbath** is the telos of the week, the climax of divine hospitality. The narrative is theological and pedagogical rather than scientific or forensic; it calls Israel to honor God’s **ordo temporum** by structuring life, work, and worship according to a revealed calendar.

LeFebvre’s approach sits in critical but sympathetic dialogue with other **evangelical** readings. With **Meredith G. Kline’s** **framework hypothesis**, he shares a sensitivity to the narrative’s architectural artistry and to its polemical vision of **cosmic temple**, yet he emphasizes **calendar** more than **cosmic geography**. With **John H. Walton’s** functional cosmic-temple proposal, he affirms that **Genesis 1** is not primarily material cosmogony but instructional text about God’s ordering of the world for human vocation; still, he resists submerging Israel’s **festal calendar** specifics under a generalized functional ontology. With **C. John Collins** and **Gordon J. Wenham**, he prizes literary cues, internal coherence, and the ecclesial reception of **Genesis** as a rule for **Sabbath**. The disputed phrase in the **Westminster Confession** in the space of six days is not, for LeFebvre, about physics but about **pedagogy** and **worship**. Reading **Genesis 1** as **calendar** deflates false conflicts between **Scripture and science** and honors Scripture’s clarity on what it actually intends to teach: God as sole Creator, the goodness of the world, the dignity of labor, and the consecration of time.

A particular strength of the book is the integration of **Sabbath** and **Jubilee**. **Leviticus 23–25** aligns weekly rest, annual festivals, and septennial rhythms in a calendrical lattice that shapes memory of **creation** and **exodus**. LeFebvre argues that this lattice is already being scaffolded by **Genesis 1**, where time itself is partitioned as a liturgical pedagogue. The moral implications are thick: Israel’s **economics** is cruciform to the **calendar**, land rests because time is holy, neighbor-love is timed by feasts and remissions, and the community of the poor is protected by a sanctified pace of life. This interlocks Sabbath ethics with creation doctrine, supplying a coherent covenantal account that is both ancient and immediately pastoral.

#### 4. Scripture, Law, and Liturgy in Canonical Context
LeFebvre’s oeuvre invites reevaluation of how the **Pentateuch** does theology. If the **law collections** are read liturgically in assembly, and if **creation** itself is taught as a calendar that inducts Israel into rest, then **Torah** is less a compendium of rules and more a **catechetical drama** in time. The book of **Deuteronomy**, with its covenant **renewal** on the plains of Moab, reads like the transcript of a liturgical service in which **blessings** and **curses** are chanted antiphonally. The reading of the law in seven-year cycles, the public feasts, and the climactic **Day of Atonement** all contextualize **Pentateuchal ethics** within the community’s doxological life. For LeFebvre, **canon** is not a static shelf but a calendar, a living schedule through which God fathers his people.

This calendar-centric hermeneutic illuminates the **structure of the Pentateuch** itself. The narrative of **Genesis–Exodus** builds toward **Sinai**, where **Sabbath** is explicitly codified, and the laws of **Leviticus** embed that Sabbath into a network of feasts and remissions. **Numbers** tests whether Israel will walk by that timekeeping wisdom in the wilderness, and **Deuteronomy** memorializes the lessons learned in a covenant service. In short, **Heilsgeschichte** is choreographed liturgically. This reading resonates with classical **Reformed** patterns of **covenant theology**, where the moral law is given not as ladder but as life-rule for the redeemed, a *lex vivendi* tethered to worship. LeFebvre’s contribution is to show how the calendar is integral to that life-rule, and how **creation** supplies not merely a metaphysical foundation but a schedule of sanctification.

#### 5. Interlocutors and Debates
LeFebvre’s two chief fields engage distinct scholarly guilds. In legal studies, he interacts with **Raymond Westbrook’s** thesis that ANE collections are royal propaganda and jurisprudential wisdom rather than enforceable code, and with **Bernard S. Jackson’s** semiotics of legal communication, including attention to recital, exemplarity, and social memory. He draws implicit synergy with cultural memory studies, though his principal sources remain legal-anthropological rather than theoretical. The upshot is a robust claim: if **Hammurabi** is not a statute-book, we should hesitate to read **Exodus 21–23** as one. Instead, law functions as moral pedagogy in a **civic calendar**, tied to festivals where it is read, sung, and renewed. This claim disciplines modern projects that try to resurrect biblical theocracy through statutory reconstruction, redirecting attention to **general equity** and **wisdom**.

In creation studies, he engages the spectrum from **young-earth concordism** to **literary frameworks**. He shares with **Meredith Kline** a non-concordist reading and with **John H. Walton** a non-materially focused ontology of **Genesis 1**, but he argues that the Bible’s own emphasis on **moedim** demands a **calendar** lens rather than a solely cosmic-temple lens. With **C. John Collins** he cares about authorial intention and the literary signals that guide readers, and with **Gordon J. Wenham** he foregrounds priestly and liturgical concerns. For intra-Reformed discourse, this helps relieve pressure on the **Westminster phrase** in the space of six days by recentering the question on catechesis. The debate then moves from geology to **Sabbath doctrine**, a venue Scripture itself highlights.

#### 6. Pastoral and Ethical Implications
LeFebvre’s concept of **civic calendar** generates pastoral fruit. If Torah is pedagogy, then preaching **Exodus** and **Leviticus** must emphasize the **wisdom** and **equity** God inculcates through exempla, and catechesis must teach the church to inhabit **time** in obedience to the **Lord’s Day** and to patterns of rest and mercy. In practical ethics, his work reframes **economic** questions through **Jubilee**: while the land laws are not simply transferable, their **general equity** challenges predatory lending, dehumanizing labor rhythms, and the erosion of sabbath rest. In spiritual formation, the church learns to mark time by **creation and redemption**, recognizing **Easter** and **Pentecost** not as extraneous liturgies but as evangelically proper anchor points that echo **Passover** and **Weeks** fulfilled in Christ. Crucially, this is not liturgical maximalism but biblical **regulation of time** as pedagogy of discipleship.

At the doctrinal level, **creation**, **providence**, and **sanctification** are joined. God orders the world and orders human time; the **Sabbath** is both creation gift and covenant sign; sanctification unfolds as a weekly schooling in rest and work that anticipate eschatological **Sabbath**. LeFebvre’s reading tasks Reformed theology to recover the texture of **time** in its dogmatics, to complement metaphysical accounts of God’s **ad extra** operations with a concrete calendar of grace. That aim is unmistakably **covenantal**, for the God who acts in **Heilsgeschichte** also scripts the church’s calendar. Law and gospel meet in time: the day is the Lord’s, and so is its rest.

#### 7. Limits, Cautions, and Clarifications
Any thesis that reframes **Torah** risks misconstrual. LeFebvre must guard against tone-deafness to the real **juridical** elements in Israel’s life, lest **law collections** be reduced to didactic literature without teeth. He typically does so by affirming **wisdom jurisprudence** and the existence of courts, yet critics might ask for deeper engagement with texts like **Deuteronomy 17** on judicial procedure. Another pressure point is historical: a calendar reading of **Genesis 1** could be misread as downplaying the **historicity** of creation or as floating free of **Mosaic** or **primeval** settings. LeFebvre counters by emphasizing what the text explicitly cues and by resisting speculative redactional reconstructions. Nevertheless, in a guild accustomed to dating and stratification hypotheses, his restraint may invite the charge of underdeveloped **source criticism**. He is content to read the **canonical** shape and its **liturgical** functions, which for confessional theology is a principled and salutary choice.

Within debates over **science and faith**, LeFebvre’s approach is intentionally non-concordist. By refusing to make **Genesis 1** answer questions it does not pose, he clarifies the church’s doctrine of **Scripture’s sufficiency** regarding faith and life. He thus aligns with classical **Reformed** insistence on Scripture’s **perspicuity** in what it teaches, while leaving legitimate space for scientific inquiry into creaturely processes. Some will desire a more explicit metaphysical account of **creation ex nihilo** and **providence** in his Genesis exposition; those doctrines are presupposed, but not the focus. This is a feature, not a bug, of a book devoted to **calendar** and **Sabbath** rather than to cosmology.

#### 8. Reception and Ongoing Influence
Among **Reformed** readers, LeFebvre’s work has served as a bridge between **confessional orthodoxy** and **academic** advances in ANE law and biblical genre. Pastors in the **Presbyterian** and wider evangelical world have found in **Collections, Codes, and Torah** a historically informed rationale for preaching **Pentateuchal law** as **wisdom** under the rubric of **general equity**, avoiding both rigid theonomic codification and antinomian neglect. In academic circles, **The Liturgy of Creation** has expanded the conversation beyond sterile debates about the length of the **creation days**, focusing instead on **Sabbath** as the theological heart of the account and on the **calendar** as the hermeneutical key. The synergy with institutions like the **Theopolis Institute** has encouraged practical retrieval of **liturgical** and **calendar** disciplines within a **covenant** frame.

This reception suggests a legacy trajectory: renewed attention to **time** as a theological category in **systematic theology**, fresh **biblical-theological** work on **Jubilee** and **economics**, and a recalibration of **Christian worship** around **Sabbath**-shaped discipleship. By re-situating **Torah** in the assembly’s calendar, LeFebvre offers the church a pattern for reading all Scripture as enacted word, a pattern amenable to **Reformed** commitments and capable of healing intramural disputes on **creation** and **law**.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS Evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, LeFebvre’s project is a welcome retrieval with clarifying power for **covenant theology**, **Sabbath**, and the **uses of the law**. His account of **law collections** fortifies WCF 19.4 on **general equity**, while his reading of **Genesis 1** as **calendar** strengthens the creational grounding of the **Lord’s Day** and links sanctification to the sanctification of time. Two cautions merit mention. First, the calendar emphasis must not mute confessional commitments to the **historical Adam**, **creation ex nihilo**, and the real sequence of divine works *ad extra*. A calendar hermeneutic is best received as mode and telos of instruction, not as denial of **history**. Second, while the denial of statutory positivism in **Torah** is salutary, Reformed orthodoxy maintains that the **moral law** summarized in the **Decalogue** binds all people at all times; thus the application of **case laws** must be governed by that moral core, avoiding any reduction of law to social poetry. The constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is to hold LeFebvre’s **liturgical pedagogy** together with the scholastic account of **natural law** and **moral universals**, rooting **equity** in creation and reading **calendar** as the church’s schoolmaster in Christ. In principle, his work coheres with this trajectory: revelation is covenantal, **grace** perfects **nature**, **history** is sacramentally remembered, and **Sabbath** orders the saints toward eschatological rest.
