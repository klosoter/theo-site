### ESSAY
Miles V. Van Pelt has built a vocation at the intersection of **biblical theology**, **Semitic philology**, and pastoral formation within the contemporary **Reformed** world. Working chiefly from Reformed Theological Seminary in the early twenty-first century, he advances a self-consciously **redemptive-historical** approach rooted in the line of **Geerhardus Vos** and **Meredith Kline**, yet mediated through concrete training in **Hebrew** and **Aramaic**. His public posture is neither antiquarian nor speculative; it is a linguistically alert, text-driven retrieval of **covenant**, **kingdom**, and **temple** as the structural grammar by which Scripture tells the one economy of the **covenant of grace**. In a theological moment marked by either disciplinary siloing or methodological skepticism, his corpus argues that rigorous **linguistics** and robust **canon** are companions, not competitors, in the church’s confession of the **Triune God**.

His method is anchored in a high **doctrine of Scripture**, with a principled commitment to **inerrancy**, authorial intention, and the **analogia fidei** as regulative norms for exegesis. He reads the Old Testament as an unfolding economy of **promise and fulfillment**, governed by the hermeneutical axiom that Christ is the telos of **Torah and Prophets** without dissolving the indigenous literary forms of **narrative**, **law**, and **prophecy**. The epistemic stance is classically Reformed: the Spirit’s **self-attestation** in the Word grounds certainty, while the exegete’s task requires the ordinary means of **grammar**, **history**, and **context**. In this frame, Van Pelt commends typology as the canon’s own mode of intra-textual reasoning, distinguished from allegory by textual **patterns**, **covenantal administrations**, and repeated **sanctuary** motifs. The result is a hermeneutic where **lexeme**, **syntax**, and **storyline** are braided into one reading that is at once theological and philological.

Van Pelt’s scholarly and pedagogical footprint is widely felt through foundational resources in the biblical languages. The coauthored **Basics of Biblical Hebrew Grammar** with **Gary D. Pratico** launched in 2001 and matured through subsequent editions to 2019 as a standard evangelical-Reformed entryway into **Hebrew morphology**, **syntax**, and the **verbal system**. The companion **Vocabulary Guide to Biblical Hebrew and Aramaic** in 2003, and his solo **Basics of Biblical Aramaic** in 2011, express a conviction that access to **textual meaning** is a matter not simply of theological instincts but of disciplined lexical and syntactic competence. The 2019 revision demonstrates attentiveness to developments in **verbal aspect**, the narrative function of **wayyiqtol** as preterite, and the pragmatic features of **discourse**. Beyond classroom grammars, his editorial leadership on **A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the Old Testament: The Gospel Promised** in 2016 models an integrative method: book-level introductions combine **historical context**, **literary design**, and **redemptive-historical** contribution under the unity of **covenant**.

If Van Pelt’s language tools represent the infrastructure, his biblical-theological contribution is often focused on the sanctuary-shaped storyline of **covenant and kingdom**. Drawing on **Eden-as-temple** motifs associated with **T. D. Alexander** and **G. K. Beale**, yet framed within **Kline’s** architecture of covenantal administration, he underscores how the **tabernacle** is a microcosm of creation, the **temple** an escalated Eden, and the **presence** of the LORD the substance that binds the narrative from **Genesis** to **Revelation**. His Ligonier series **The Tabernacle** in 2013 displays this emphasis for lay catechesis, reading **Exodus 25–40** as a theological engine for **sacrifice**, **priesthood**, and **holy space**, anticipating the **incarnation** of the Word and the **church** as temple by the Spirit. The pattern is christocentric without collapsing the **Mosaic** dispensation into abstraction; law and cult are read as pedagogies of **holiness** that converge on the person and work of **Christ**.

Within the prophetic corpus, Van Pelt has been a persistent advocate of canonical sensitivity, especially to the compositional integrity of the **Book of the Twelve**. He highlights the editorial seams and thematic recurrences that render **Hosea** through **Malachi** a curated testimony to **the Day of the LORD**, the twin poles of **judgment and restoration**, and the emergence of the **new covenant**. Here he draws from and popularizes insights found across the work of **James Nogalski**, **Paul House**, and **Dempster**, but he presses them into the service of **Reformed preaching**: individual oracles become intelligible nodes within a designed network that culminates in **gospel** proclamation. The intent is not to deny historical settings but to insist that canonical arrangement is itself a mode of **inspired meaning**, a theological act that frames **intertextual** echoes from **Torah** and earlier **prophets**.

A trademark of Van Pelt’s teaching is his disciplined attention to the **Hebrew verbal system** and **discourse structure** as hermeneutical guides. Following the corrective of **James Barr** against naive word-study, and receptive to advances in **functional linguistics**, he trains students to attend to **clause sequencing**, **prominence marking**, and **cohesion** devices. The narrative preterite force of **wayyiqtol** in past time narration, the perfective nuance of **qatal** versus the imperfective orientation of **yiqtol**, and the pragmatic use of **fronting** and **asyndeton** in prophetic poetry are not technical byways but pastoral tools. These grammatical patterns, in his pedagogy, govern the rise and fall of plot, the staging of argument, and the force of exhortation, protecting the pulpit from both lexical moralism and systematic overreach. In this way, **linguistics** serves **exegesis**, which in turn serves **doctrine**.

Canon and text are for Van Pelt entwined with theology. He aligns with a cautious primacy of the **Masoretic Text**, while encouraging comparative sensitivity to **Septuagint** renderings where New Testament authors signal interpretive trajectories. His work on **Aramaic** is more than curricular rounding; it draws attention to the exilic and postexilic witness of **Daniel** and **Ezra** in the lingua franca of empire, integrating **diaspora** existence into the canonical portrait of the **kingdom of God**. The canon’s shape, from **Torah** through **Prophets** and **Writings**, is read as a divine pedagogy in history, with **wisdom** literature reflecting on the fear of the LORD within the covenant and the **Psalms** authorizing Christological prayer within the unfolding **Davidic** promise.

The pastoral horizon of Van Pelt’s scholarship is unmistakable. In the **A Biblical-Theological Introduction to the Old Testament**, his editorial strategy is to give pastors handholds for preaching **Christ** from every book by recovering native **genres**, covenantal settings, and typological trajectories. He repeatedly shows how the **exodus** functions as the Old Testament’s primal salvation event and as a template for the **new exodus** in **Isaiah**, culminating in the paschal **death and resurrection** of Jesus. The **temple** and **sacrifice** form a grammar for the **atonement**, the **Davidic** storyline shapes **Christology**, and the **exile-restoration** rhythm informs **ecclesiology** and **sacramentology**. Van Pelt presses toward pastoral clarity: the Lord’s Supper as covenant renewal in the new covenant, the church as a priestly house, and sanctification as **holy war** against the powers in union with the **Divine Warrior**.

Intellectually, Van Pelt stands in conversation with a wide spectrum. He rejects **Wellhausen’s** source-critical atomization and the late-phase skepticism of **form-** and **tradition-criticism**, but he appropriates controlled insights from **ANE backgrounds** through voices like **John Walton** where they illuminate the **temple-cosmos** nexus without displacing the Bible’s own categories. With **Sailhamer**, he acknowledges compositional strategy at the level of the canon, yet he retains a stronger emphasis on covenantal administration and liturgical architecture learned from **Kline** and integrated with **Vos**’s kingdom-through-history motif. He shares ground with **Gentry and Wellum** on the centrality of covenant across the canon, while operating in a more explicitly **Reformed confessional** register. On hermeneutics, he aligns with the **Christocentric** tradition while resisting **christotelic** proposals that detach New Testament usage from Old Testament authorial intention, seeking instead warranted **typology** embedded in the textual fabric.

The practical fruit of Van Pelt’s approach is a trained pastoral eye capable of handling **prophecy**, **apocalyptic**, and **poetry** with textual sobriety and theological verve. He instructs preachers to watch how **Micah’s** covenant lawsuit format functions within Deuteronomic sanctions, how **Zechariah’s** visions rehearse temple restoration in symbolic idiom, and how **Jonah** operates as a missional and judicial satire within the Twelve’s theology of **Nineveh**. He presses students to trace the **Day of the LORD** from **Amos** to **1 Thessalonians**, the **new covenant** from **Jeremiah 31** to **Hebrews**, and the **Spirit** from creation to Pentecost along the lines of textual markers. In short, doctrinal formulation is nourished by the canon’s internal symmetries and its relentless movement from **promise** to **Christ** to **church** to **consummation**.

Reformed and WTS evaluation: Van Pelt’s synthesis of **linguistics**, **covenant theology**, and **canonical unity** sits comfortably within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, particularly the **Westminster** tradition’s account of Scripture and the **covenant of grace**. His strengths are considerable: he equips ministers to read the Old Testament with reverence for **authorial intent**, attentiveness to **grammar**, and boldness in **Christological** proclamation. Potential tensions appear where strong claims for the **Book of the Twelve** as a single literary macro-work may outpace demonstrable historical evidence, and where expansive **temple typology** risks becoming a univocal key that compresses diverse genres and historical contingencies. Theologically, his biblical-theological presentations could be further fortified by explicit dogmatic tethering to **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **the pactum salutis**, guarding against any drift toward narrative immanentism. A calibrated alternative within classical Reformed thought would accentuate the reciprocity of **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** under the **analogia fidei**, affirm **sensus plenior** as divinely warranted by inspiration rather than as readerly license, and give fuller place to **natural law** and **creational order** alongside redemptive themes. Even with these cautions, Van Pelt’s contribution remains a generative model of Reformed scholarship, where **philology** fuels **theology**, and **covenant-temple** structures guide the church toward the fullness of **Christ**.
