### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Mark W. Karlberg emerges from the late twentieth-century nexus of **Westminster Calvinism**, where disputes over **covenant theology**, **justification**, and the shape of **biblical theology** became institutional flashpoints. Trained within the orbit of **Westminster Theological Seminary**, Karlberg assimilated the **Vosian** commitment to redemptive-historical exegesis and the distinctive covenantal insights of **Meredith G. Kline**, while simultaneously reading the **Westminster Standards** as a doctrinal constitution. His method is self-consciously federal and confessional: the Bible’s narrative is read through the categories of **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae**, but the categories themselves are exegetically refined by close attention to **Galatians**, **Romans**, and **Hebrews**, and by the typological structure of **Israel’s theocracy**. He insists on the **law–gospel distinction** as a covenantal and eschatological distinction, not a metaphysical dualism, deploying **intrusion ethics** to explain holy war, land sanctions, and the national probation of Israel. Against theological revisionisms that flatten covenantal differences, his method foregrounds the **merit** of the two Adams, the **imputation of active obedience**, and the judicial texture of **justification sola fide**.

Karlberg’s intellectual context is the aftermath of the **Shepherd controversy** at Westminster in the 1970s and early 1980s, followed by the rise of the **New Perspective on Paul** and **Federal Vision**. He views these movements as symptoms of a deeper erosion of classic **Reformed federalism**. At stake are the coherence of **forensic justification**, the integrity of the **covenant of works**, and whether the **Mosaic covenant** reintroduces the **works principle** in a way that is pedagogically and typologically compatible with the **covenant of grace**. His stance is both historical and polemical: historical, in recovering strands from **Cocceius**, **Turretin**, and **Witsius**; polemical, in disputing readings of **Murray**, **Gaffin**, and **Shepherd** that, in his judgment, destabilize **merit**, **imputation**, and the **law–gospel** axis.

#### 2. Major works and governing thesis
Karlberg’s **Covenant Theology in Reformed Perspective** (2000) assembles essays and reviews that trace a through-line from **classic federalism** to a contemporary articulation of **republication** at Sinai. The thesis is programmatic: the **covenant of works** is not merely a theological construct but a biblical reality whose republication, in a typological and national mode, structures **Mosaic law** and the probation of Israel’s kingdom. In **Moses and Jesus** (2012), he turns to the christocentric patterning of covenants, arguing that **Jesus as new Moses** fulfills and supersedes the **Mosaic economy** by satisfying the **works principle** in his **active and passive obedience**, thereby inaugurating the eschatological **Sabbath rest** prefigured from **creation** and anticipated in **Canaan**. In **The Mosaic Covenant of Works** (2014), Karlberg offers his most concentrated argument for the **works principle** at Sinai and its role in safeguarding **justification by faith alone**. A companion volume, **Engaging Westminster Calvinism** (2013), situates these claims within the doctrinal grammar of **WCF 7** and **WCF 19**, interpreting the law’s covenantal function, the **threefold use of the law**, and the confessional affirmation of the **covenant of works** as a positive legal order distinct from the **covenant of grace**.

The governing thesis across these works is that the **Mosaic economy** operates on two coordinated levels. On the level of redemptive grace, Israel shares in the one **covenant of grace** through promises, sacrifices, and types that witness to **Christ**. On the national-typological level, Israel as a corporate son is placed under a **works principle** concerning tenure in the land, blessings and curses, and the maintenance of the theocracy. This duality is not duplicity. It is the God-ordained structure by which the **law** exposes sin, intensifies transgression, and tutors Israel toward **Christ**, even as the republication of the **works principle** re-stages the **Adamic probation** in a provisional and typological way.

#### 3. Mosaic republication and the structure of law and gospel
The heart of Karlberg’s contribution is a robust doctrine of **republication**. He reads **Exodus 19–24**, **Leviticus 26**, and **Deuteronomy 28–30** as covenantal codifications of a **works principle**: do this and live in the land, but transgress and be vomited out. The land promises are therefore conditioned at the level of national life. By aligning this with **Galatians 3**, he contends that the **law added because of transgressions** is not a soteric path to life but a covenantally real and typological administration of the **covenant of works**. The era of the law is pedagogical and provisional, not remedial in the sense of supplementing grace with works.

In his exegesis of **Galatians** and **Romans**, Karlberg stresses that **works of the law** cannot be confined to boundary markers, contra the **New Perspective** of **Dunn** and **Wright**. For Paul, the legal regime represents an order in which the **works principle** is codified and which, apart from **Christ**, exposes the universal plight of sinners under wrath. This reading coheres with **Hebrews** on the obsolescence of the **old covenant**, the covenant-breaking of the first generation in the wilderness, and the relocation of **Sabbath rest** in the priestly work of the ascended **Christ**. Hence the **law–gospel distinction** is not primarily psychological or homiletical but covenantal and eschatological: the **gospel** delivers what the **law** demands by the **merit** of the second Adam.

#### 4. Adam, merit, and the active obedience of Christ
Karlberg’s reading of **creation** and **fall** is unambiguously **federal**. The **Adamic administration** is a true **covenant of works** promising consummate, eschatological life upon perfect obedience. Here he closely follows **Kline** in arguing for the reality of **merit** that is not of grace. The **Sabbath** is embedded as eschatological sign, a proleptic pledge of **glory** upon completion of probation. Adam’s failure brings a universal loss of title to life and renders the law a ministry of death. Enter **Christ**, who, as federal head, fulfills the **works principle** in totality. The **imputation of active obedience** is not a scholastic corollary but the necessary entailment of a genuine **covenant of works** at creation and its republication under **Moses**. Thus, the righteousness by which the ungodly are justified is the covenantal righteousness of a second Adam who has merited life and inheritance by obedience unto death.

By guarding a strong doctrine of **merit** and **imputation**, Karlberg resists readings that make **union with Christ** the ontology that swallows the court. He affirms **duplex gratia** within union, yet he contends for the logical and judicial priority of **justification** as the legal gateway to the benefits of salvation. In this way the **ordo salutis** is not dissolved into the **historia salutis** but aligned to it: what **Christ** accomplishes in redemptive history grounds and structures the order of application in the believer.

#### 5. Ordo salutis, union, and the Westminster grammar
Central to Karlberg’s project is a precise reading of the **Westminster Confession**. He emphasizes **WCF 7** on the difference of covenants, **WCF 11** on **justification**, and **WCF 19** on **law**. In his account, **WCF 19.1** recognizes the **covenant of works** given to Adam and renewed in a typological way to Israel, while **WCF 19.6** secures the third use of the law under the **covenant of grace** without reintroducing works as a condition for life. He critiques trajectories influenced by **John Murray** and mediated through **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** which emphasize **union with Christ** in a manner that, he argues, risks collapsing the **forensic** into the **transformative**. The grammar of **faith alone** and the **imputation of the obedience and satisfaction of Christ** must structure the order of application if the **law–gospel** distinction is to be preserved in both preaching and sacramental practice.

In this frame, Karlberg’s insistence on the **priority of the legal** is not a retreat to bare legalism but a pastoral safeguard. Believers must know that the **righteousness** counted to them is complete and alien, and that their obedience functions within **sanctification** as fruit and evidence, never as ground or instrument of **justification**. He sees this emphasis as the pastoral outworking of the **confessional** doctrine and as the proper result of the republication thesis, which prevents the smuggling of a **works principle** into the order of grace for individual salvation.

#### 6. Interventions: Shepherd, New Perspective, and Federal Vision
Karlberg’s polemical chapters engage three linked challenges. First, the **Shepherd controversy** presented a model in which initial justification is by faith but final salvation is by faith and works understood as covenantal faithfulness. To Karlberg this is a revival of **monocovenantalism** that blurs **law–gospel** and undermines **assurance**. Second, the **New Perspective on Paul** shifts the referent of **works of the law** to Jewish identity markers, thus recasting Paul’s polemic as ethnocentric rather than soteriological. Karlberg counters that Paul contends against any **works principle** for life, whether ceremonial or moral, because the **Mosaic covenant** codified a real legal demand that only **Christ** could answer. Third, the **Federal Vision** promotes **baptismal objectivity** and speaks of **final justification** according to works. Karlberg meets this with the **Westminster** doctrine of **sacramental signs and seals** and with his two-level account of **Moses**, in which the reintroduced **works principle** concerns Israel’s corporate order, not the ordo salutis of individual salvation.

Even where he agrees with critics of the **New Perspective** and **Federal Vision**, Karlberg’s distinctive contribution is to locate the confessional fault line at **Sinai**. It is not enough to affirm **imputation** and **sola fide** abstractly. One must attend to the federal structure by which **Moses** redramatizes **Adam** so that **Christ** can be seen and preached as the One who satisfies a genuine and historically enacted **works principle** on behalf of his people.

#### 7. Exegesis in service of system: Galatians, Hebrews, and typology
Karlberg’s exegesis of **Galatians 3–4** is the exegetical pole of his system. The **pedagogue** is not mere personal conviction of sin but the entire **Mosaic epoch** that stands in contrast to the **Abrahamic promise** realized in **Christ**. The temporal subordination of the **law** is simultaneously a covenantal contrast. In **Hebrews 3–4** the typological **rest** of **Canaan** is forfeited by disobedience and holds open the pattern of **Adamic probation**, which **Christ** recapitulates and fulfills. On this basis, Karlberg integrates **Kline’s intrusion ethics**: the theocracy is an eschatological intrusion in which the **sanctions** of the last day appear proleptically in history, explaining both the severity of the national curse and the provisional role of **Mosaic penal law**.

Typology thus does heavy lifting in Karlberg’s system. **Priesthood**, **sacrifice**, and **temple** administrate the **covenant of grace**, while **kingdom**, **land**, and **sanctions** administrate the **works principle** at a national level. The unity of the **covenant of grace** is preserved through the sacrificial types pointing to **Christ**, while the pedagogical function of the **law** is intensified by the typological republication that keeps before Israel the demand for perfect obedience. The upshot is homiletical and sacramental clarity: preach **Christ’s obedience** as the ground of **justification**, and preach the **law** as rule of gratitude for the justified.

#### 8. Historical location within Reformed federalism
Karlberg situates himself as a reforming heir of classic **Reformed orthodoxy**. He reads **Calvin** with attention to **autotheos** and divine sovereignty but draws his covenant loci from **Ursinus**, **Turretin**, and **Witsius**, together with **Cocceius** on the historical development of covenants. He retrieves strands in **Witsius** that speak of a **subservient** or **mixed** dimension to **Moses**, yet he insists that his **republication** thesis is not a novelty but a sharpening required by sustained exegesis in light of **Galatians** and **Hebrews**. The mid-twentieth century adjustments of **John Murray** receive respectful but firm critique. Murray’s hesitancy about the term **covenant of works** and his emphasis on unified **administration** across the testaments, while aiming at biblical fidelity, can, in Karlberg’s judgment, cascade into reduced clarity about **merit**, **imputation**, and the **law–gospel** distinction. With **Vos**, he maintains the primacy of **historia salutis**, yet he alerts readers to protect the traditional **ordo salutis** so that **justification** retains forensic primacy within the duplex grace of **union with Christ**.

This historical self-location explains both Karlberg’s polemical energy and his constructive aim. By aligning **Kline** with **Westminster**, he seeks to show that republication at **Sinai** is not a sectarian project of a West Coast school but the ecumenical voice of classic **Reformed federalism** updated in light of modern biblical theology.

#### 9. Reception, influence, and institutional stakes
Karlberg’s theses have been debated across the **OPC**, **PCA**, and **URCNA**, especially where questions of **republication**, **merit**, and **justification** surface in examinations of ministers and in synodical reports on the **New Perspective** and **Federal Vision**. His writing, often appearing in essays, conference papers, and monographs, has helped codify what many call the **Klinean** reading of **Moses**, and has offered a systematic framework that some found missing in Kline’s own more programmatic works such as **By Oath Consigned** and **Kingdom Prologue**. Among sympathetic readers his work provides exegetical ballast for catechesis on **law and gospel**, clarity on **imputation**, and a robust account of the **active obedience of Christ**. Among critics his insistence on **merit** and a two-level **Mosaic economy** appears to threaten the unity of the **covenant of grace** or to invite a Lutheranizing dichotomy within Reformed categories.

Institutionally, the debates that frame Karlberg’s career are more than academic. They shape curricula, preaching, and discipline. The reading of **WCF 7** and **WCF 19** proposed by Karlberg informs how churches fence the **Lord’s Table**, examine candidates on **justification**, and articulate the **third use of the law**. His influence is therefore practical: guarding the pulpit from soteric confusion while encouraging a preaching of **Christ’s finished work** that springs from a coherent **federal theology**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A candid **Reformed/WTS evaluation** must weigh strengths and tensions. Karlberg’s chief strength is conceptual clarity on **merit**, **imputation**, and the **covenant of works**, together with exegetical seriousness regarding **Galatians**, **Romans**, and **Hebrews**. He retrieves an authentically **Westminster** grammar of **law and gospel** and shows how **republication** at **Sinai** guards the freeness of **justification**. His account of **two-level administration** in the **Mosaic economy** admirably preserves the unity of the **covenant of grace** at the soteric level while recognizing the national-typological **works principle**. Yet tensions remain. Critics argue that a strong appeal to **merit** risks transposing a scholastic measure of condign worth into the exegesis of **Adam** and **Israel**, where Scripture speaks of divine benevolence and condescension in covenant. Others contend that the binary of **works principle** and **grace principle** can be stated so starkly that it occludes the positive moral pedagogy of **Torah** within the **covenant of grace**. Historically, some read **Witsius** and **Owen** as offering a **subservient covenant** model that nuances the claim of republication and might avoid the impression of two covenants running concurrently at **Sinai**. Within the **WTS** family, the accent on **forensic priority** has sometimes been heard as diminishing the richness of **union with Christ** in **sanctification** and **adoption**. A constructive alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would retain Karlberg’s firm **forensic** commitments and his reading of **Christ’s active obedience**, while presenting **Moses** as a unified administration of the **covenant of grace** that temporarily bears a typological layer of national probation, thus softening the rhetoric of dual structures without surrendering the **law–gospel** distinction. Even where such calibrations are proposed, Karlberg’s central insistence stands: only a federal theology that protects the reality of the **covenant of works**, the typological **republication** at **Sinai**, and the exclusive **merit** of **Christ** can consistently underwrite **justification sola fide**.
