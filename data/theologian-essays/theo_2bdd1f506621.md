### ESSAY
Richard Lints emerges within the shifting terrain of late‑modern **Reformed evangelicalism**, trained in historical and systematic theology during the 1980s and then stationed for decades at **Gordon‑Conwell Theological Seminary** while also advising urban church planters through **Redeemer City to City**. This dual location functions as his laboratory: the academy provides argumentative rigor and the city tests theology against the density of culture, desire, and institutions. Theologically he self‑consciously locates himself in the stream of **Calvin** and **Edwards** while learning from **Kuyper** and **Bavinck** how a **covenant‑shaped worldview** frames public life. In a context dominated by arguments between **foundationalism** and **postliberalism**, he stakes out a chastened **critical realism** that insists on the *analogia fidei* while deploying a **canonical‑narrative** imagination to unify doctrine and exegesis. The controlling conviction is that divine **revelation** is covenantal and self‑attesting, yet accessed through historically embedded communities that learn to see by Scripture’s light.

His early programmatic book, **The Fabric of Theology** (1993), addresses prolegomena. Against the residual **foundationalism** of some evangelical theologies and the linguistic conventionalism of **George Lindbeck’s** cultural‑linguistic model, Lints argues for a Scripture‑governed **worldview** that is both cognitive and liturgical. The task is to weave a fabric whose warp is **canonical coherence** and whose woof is **ecclesial practice**, with **imagination** operating not as aesthetic ornament but as the constructive capacity to perceive the canonical pattern. This is neither fideist nor rationalist: it is a **critical realist** account in which Scripture, as **covenantal canon**, forms the community’s rationality, generating interpretive virtues and public claims without surrendering to modern **foundationalist** criteria. The proposed prolegomenon thus integrates **biblical theology** and **systematic theology** through a narrative of creation, fall, redemption, and consummation that yields doctrinal loci within the **covenant** economy.

A second line of inquiry culminates in **The Unfolding Mystery of the Divine Name** (2012), a exegetical‑dogmatic meditation on **Exodus 3 and 34**. Here Lints retrieves the classical grammar of **aseity**, **immutability**, and **divine simplicity** by following the canonical development of the **Name YHWH**. The self‑identification I AM WHO I AM is read as a revelation of **actus purus**, not an indeterminate presence, and the **Name** is the vehicle of **covenant presence** that secures Israel’s life and mission. Lints traverses the terrain of modern **relational theologies** and **open theism**, arguing that the God who bears a Name is not mutable pathos but the faithful Lord whose **glory** dwells among his people. Through **canonical typology**, the Name that is proclaimed in **Exodus 34:6‑7** becomes personal in the **Christological** confession that Jesus bears the divine Name, such that New Testament doxology is the decisive disclosure of the One who is from himself and toward us. The retrieval is not bare repristination: it is a narratively embedded **classical theism**, holding divine transcendence and covenantal nearness without capitulating to modern voluntarism or historicist actualism.

The anthropological counterpart arrives in **Identity and Idolatry** (2015), which reframes **imago Dei** as vocation under the rubric of worship. Drawing on **Genesis 1‑3**, **Psalm 115**, **Isaiah 44**, and **Romans 1**, Lints argues that idolatry is not merely disobedience but the **inversion of imaging**: humans become like what they adore. This is a thick **liturgical anthropology** that borrows from **Augustine’s ordo amoris**, aligns with **Calvin’s** depiction of the heart as an **idol factory**, and converses with more recent claims about **cultural liturgies**. Identity is derivative and teleological; imitation of the living God configures human agency toward justice, holiness, and love, whereas the fabrication of gods levels personhood into commodity and technique. By integrating **biblical theology** with moral psychology, the volume gives pastors and scholars a grammar for cultural critique and spiritual formation that refuses the secular‑sacred divide, recovering **vocation** as priestly representation under the **covenant**.

Editorial work like **Renewing the Evangelical Mission** (2013) widens the scope from doctrinal loci to institutional ecology. Lints diagnoses the fragmentation of **evangelicalism** as a failure of theological nerve and institutional memory, proposing a recovery of **gospel‑centered** identity that is simultaneously catholic in charity and confessional in substance. He presses for a **public theology** that inhabits pluralist contexts without surrendering the scandal of **Christ’s lordship**. The project connects to his urban experience: churches in the city must pair doctrinal depth with institutional imagination, rooting **mission** in practices of catechesis, mercy, and persuasive apologetics. The point is not mere activism but the cultivation of communities whose **worldview** is embodied in liturgy and witness.

Across these projects, several conceptual tools recur and interlock. The motif of **covenant presence** links the **divine Name** to the **imago Dei**, so that theology proper and anthropology are internally related. The **Name** secures God’s self‑consistency and faithful proximity; the **image** locates human identity in reflective representation, a participation by grace that is moral and missional rather than metaphysical. **Canonical typology** is the hermeneutical bridge: the temple presence of God, the glory in the wilderness, and the Spirit’s indwelling converge in the **Christological** telos, where the people of God become a royal priesthood imaging the **Triune** Name among the nations. Lints emphasizes that such participation never erodes **Creator‑creature distinction**; rather, it fulfills the **covenant** promise, rescuing *finitum* to share in divine life through union with Christ, not by collapsing into the infinite.

Methodologically, Lints triangulates among several modern schools. With **Lindbeck** he acknowledges the communal and linguistic shape of doctrine, yet he resists reducing **truth** to grammar by maintaining **cognitive content** and referential claims rooted in **revelation**. With **Carl F. H. Henry** he insists on **propositional** adequacy, yet he rejects an epistemic **foundationalism** that would anchor theology in neutral reason rather than **self‑attesting Scripture**. He draws on **Alvin Plantinga’s** **Reformed epistemology** to underwrite warranted Christian belief, while preferring a more canonical and ecclesial route that foregrounds the **principia cognoscendi** of theology as divine revelation, ministerially rather than magistrially received. He converses with **James K. A. Smith** on **cultural liturgies** and with **N. T. Wright** on **biblical theology**, but in each case keeps a sharper tether to **classical theism** and confessional **covenant** theology than some contemporary proposals. The result is a chastened **critical realism**: acknowledgement of interpretive locatedness, refusal of relativism, and confidence that Scripture’s canonical form gives the Church a stable ontology and mission.

Historically, Lints stands in a recognizably **Reformed** lineage. **Calvin’s** **sensus divinitatis** and doctrine of **idolatry** provide psychological diagnostics; **Kuyper’s** **Weltanschauung** underscores the public scope of the gospel; **Bavinck’s** synthetic genius models how **dogmatics** receives its architecture from Scripture’s history; **Edwards’s** affectional ontology clarifies how seeing divine beauty reorders love and thus identity. Lints retrieves these resources to contest both the thin moralism of some evangelical activism and the anti‑metaphysical tilt of some post‑Barthian programs. His persistent insistence is that the God of **Sinai** is the God of **Golgotha**, that **classical attributes** do not encumber but rather secure God’s redemptive nearness, and that the Church’s cultural presence must be measured by **covenant** fidelity and neighbor‑serving holiness.

In the pulpit and classroom, Lints’s work has clear traction. The idolatry‑identity analysis has become a staple of **pastoral counseling**, **urban church planting**, and **catechesis**, especially in networks influenced by **Redeemer Presbyterian Church**. His canonical retrieval of the **Name** furnishes a catechetical pathway into **the doctrine of God** that avoids abstraction by rooting transcendence in the drama of redemption. Seminary courses employ **The Fabric of Theology** to introduce **evangelical prolegomena** that neither idolizes method nor abandons it, and the emphasis on **imagination** has encouraged theologians to attend to aesthetics and practices as constitutive components of **worldview**. The overall legacy is a pattern of integration: dogmatics that is exegetically grounded, classically ordered, culturally alert, and ecclesially fruitful.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. There is deep alignment with **classical theism**, **covenant theology**, and **canonical** exegesis, and the concentration on **idolatry** coheres with a **Van Tilian** stress on antithesis between covenant faith and unbelief. Some tensions remain at the level of principia. Lints’s **critical realism** helpfully rejects neutrality, but Westminster instincts will press that **self‑attesting Scripture** and **covenantal epistemology** are not heuristic options but principial commitments that govern method from the outset. The **worldview** idiom can drift toward sociological description unless strictly ordered to the **Word‑Spirit** authority that constitutes the Church’s knowing; here a more explicit **analogical reasoning** anchored in **Creator‑creature distinction** would guard against any tacit domestication of divine mystery. On culture, his rich use of **common grace** and institutional imagination is salutary, yet Westminster cautions that **antithesis** must be kept sharp enough to expose the noetic effects of sin in late‑modern plausibility structures. None of these cautions undercut the usefulness of his program; rather, they suggest a refined alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**: begin dogmatics doxologically from the **self‑attesting canon**, sustain method by covenantal and analogical constraints, and let **redemptive‑historical** exegesis discipline cultural engagement so that every appeal to **worldview** is measured by the living **Name** who speaks.
