### ESSAY
Matthew Levering has emerged as a leading voice in contemporary **Roman Catholic dogmatics**, synthesizing **Thomistic metaphysics** with **biblical theology** under the aegis of **Dei Verbum**. His abiding thesis is that the Church must retrieve **Aquinas** for a Scripture-saturated dogmatics that honors **divine simplicity**, **participation**, and the **sacramental economy**. Situated in the post–**Vatican II** landscape of **ressourcement**, he reads **Augustine**, **de Lubac**, and **Balthasar** as catalysts for a renewal of **nature and grace** that resists both historicist reduction and abstract system. The result is a biblically dense, metaphysically serious, ecclesially located theology that argues for the coherence of **creatio ex nihilo**, **Trinitarian processions and missions**, and **ecclesial mediation** as the grammar of Christian confession.

Levering’s formation and institutional labors display the programmatic character of this **ressourcement Thomism**. He has taught at **Ave Maria University**, at the **University of Saint Mary of the Lake Mundelein Seminary**, and since 2020 at the **University of St. Thomas in Houston**, a hub for the **Center for Thomistic Studies**. He co-founded and co-edits the English edition of **Nova et Vetera**, a journal devoted to renewing **Aquinas** within contemporary **dogmatic theology**. His intellectual debts are explicit: to **Thomas Aquinas** for a robust doctrine of **participation** and **divine act**, to **Augustine** for the primacy of **grace** and the **oratio and contemplatio** pattern of theology, to **Henri de Lubac** for the reassertion of the **supernatural** as the gratuitous end of nature, and to **Hans Urs von Balthasar** and **Joseph Ratzinger** for a christologically concentrated **theological aesthetics** and **biblical ontology**.

Methodologically, Levering names his project **participatory biblical exegesis**. In **Participatory Biblical Exegesis** 2008 and **Scripture and Metaphysics** 2004 he argues that the literal sense of Scripture invites metaphysical participation in the realities signified. The divine names of **Exodus 3** and the **I am** sayings, the doxologies of **Paul**, and the temple pattern of **John** press theology toward **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **analogical predication**. The *analogia entis* is not a rival to revelation but the creaturely grammar by which the **analogia fidei** communicates the triune **mystery**. The missions of **Son** and **Spirit** are the *ad extra* revelation of *ad intra* processions, so that exegesis that tracks covenantal economy inevitably ascends to **processions and missions**. This approach intentionally opposes both a historicist **biblical theology** severed from dogma and a metaphysics neglectful of **salvation history**.

His entrée into dogmatics came through the typological and sacrificial themes of **Christ's Fulfillment of Torah and Temple** 2002 and **Sacrifice and Community** 2006. There he reads **Aquinas’s** biblical commentaries to claim that Christ is the concrete **telos of Torah**, the **High Priest** whose once-for-all sacrifice founds the Eucharistic **sacrament** and the **Church** as priestly people. The temple is not discarded but transfigured in the **body of Christ**, the **Spirit-indwelt** Temple that gathers Israel and the nations. These biblical-dogmatic claims set the pattern for later volumes in which **soteriology**, **ecclesiology**, and **sacramentality** are argued on the basis of the deep canonical patterns of **covenant**, **wisdom**, and **sacrifice**.

The large Engaging the Doctrine series consolidates his vision across loci. In **Engaging the Doctrine of the Trinity** 2012 he retrieves **Augustine** and **Aquinas** to defend **divine simplicity** and **inseparable operations** while highlighting the missions as the grammar of **deification**. He treats the **Father** as fontal plenitude, the **Son** as eternal **Word**, and the **Spirit** as subsistent **Love and Gift**, adverting to **Romans 5** and **John 14–17** to show how the Church participates in triune life. In **Engaging the Doctrine of Revelation** 2014 he aligns **Dei Verbum**, **Newman** on development, and **Ratzinger** on ecclesial form to argue that **Scripture and Tradition** are one economy of the **Word** entrusted to the **Church**. **Engaging the Doctrine of the Holy Spirit** 2016 reads the **Spirit** as Love who perfects the theological virtues and constitutes the **Church** as a communion ordered to the **beatific vision**. **Engaging the Doctrine of Marriage** 2015 advances a robust **sacramental ontology** of marriage as **covenant**, intrinsically ordered to **procreation** and **sanctification**, in conversation with **John Paul II**’s **Theology of the Body**. **Engaging the Doctrine of Creation** 2017 defends **creatio ex nihilo**, **providence**, and the fittingness of a hierarchical cosmos against both **Barthian** suspicion of natural knowledge and contemporary **theistic personalism**.

Levering’s treatment of **predestination and providence** exemplifies his Augustinian Thomism. In **Predestination: Biblical and Theological Paths** 2011 he traces **Romans 8–11** and **Ephesians 1** with **Augustine**, **Thomas**, and subsequent debates between **Banezian** and **Molinist** schools. He endorses a Thomistic account of **efficacious grace** and **predestination** as logically prior to foreseen merits, while insisting with **1 Timothy 2** on the **universal salvific will** of God. The key is **participatory causality**. God as first cause moves secondary causes infallibly yet noncoercively, so that human freedom is elevated, not negated. Theologically he resists any picture of divine premotion that would collapse into fatalism, while also rejecting **congruism** that would ground efficacy in foreseen consent. The pastoral upshot is confidence in **providence** joined to summons to **prayer**, **sacraments**, and **virtue**, a harmony he finds modeled in **Aquinas** and confessed across the canonical witness.

Ethics and culture enter his project through **natural law** and conscience. In **Biblical Natural Law** 2008 he argues that the **lex naturalis** is not an extrinsic overlay but the moral shape of creaturely participation in **divine wisdom** as disclosed in **Genesis**, **Wisdom**, and **Romans 2**. Natural law is teleological and theocentric, ordered to **beatitudo** and perfected by **grace**. In **The Abuse of Conscience** 2021 he narrates a century of Catholic moral theology, critiquing proportionalism and **situation ethics** after **Vatican II** and defending **Veritatis Splendor** on exceptionless norms. Conscience is not an autonomous oracle but the prudent application of truth about the good. In **Was the Reformation a Mistake?** 2017 he addresses **sola scriptura** and **sola fide**, arguing that Catholic doctrine is **biblical** when read within the **sacramental economy** and that **justification** as transformative participation neither negates gratuitous **grace** nor undermines assurance grounded in **Christ**. The book’s exchange with **Kevin J. Vanhoozer** demonstrates Levering’s willingness to test **Catholic dogma** in Protestant conversation.

Metaphysics and apologetics are addressed in **Proofs of God** 2018 and in sustained appeals to **Aquinas** across the corpus. Levering offers a historical survey of arguments for **God’s existence** from the Fathers to modernity, defending a chastened **natural theology** that can resource **evangelization**. He insists that the **five ways** and their family of demonstrations introduce the intellect to the God of **ipsum esse subsistens** who is simple, immutable, and good. This affirmation undergirds his critique of **theistic personalism**, which treats God as a being among beings and distorts **divine names** and **providence**. In **Engaging the Doctrine of Creation** 2017 he disputes **Barth’s** suspicion of **analogia entis**, contending that grace presupposes nature and heals and elevates it, so that the created order genuinely signifies the **Creator**. His reading of **de Lubac** on the **natural desire for God** safeguards gratuity by locating the desire as a participation-called-to-fulfillment, not a capacity that demands the **beatific vision** by nature.

Most distinctive is Levering’s integrative handling of **Scripture** within **dogmatics**. He mines **Aquinas’s biblical commentaries** to model exegesis that is literal, spiritual, and ecclesial, so that **Christology**, **Trinity**, and **ecclesiology** are drawn directly from the canonical form. Works such as **Scripture and Metaphysics** 2004 and **Holy People, Holy Land** 2005 show his comfort moving from **exegesis** of **Exodus**, **Leviticus**, and **John** to the **Eucharist**, **Temple typology**, and the **Church** as the eschatological Israel. The **sacramental form of Scripture** implies a sacramental form of theology. Hence **Tradition** is not a rival to the Bible but the Spirit’s ongoing pedagogy, the **rule of faith** that guards the integrity of **doctrine** and makes possible catholic reception through **liturgy** and **magisterium**. This ecclesial hermeneutic leads to a thick account of the **saints** and **virtues** in the formation of theological understanding.

Stylistically, Levering’s prose is dialogical and constructive. He refuses polemical narrowing, engaging **Barth**, **Webster**, and **Childs** at length to demonstrate convergences in **classical theism** and sanctified reason while naming nonnegotiables like **analogia entis** and **sacramental mediation**. He consistently pairs **Augustine** and **Aquinas** with **Balthasar**, **Ratzinger**, and **John Paul II**, producing a recognizably Catholic yet biblically attentive dogmatics. His editorial leadership of **Nova et Vetera** has been decisive for an English-language audience, forming a generation of theologians in **participatory metaphysics**, **virtue ethics**, and a hermeneutic of continuity with **Tradition**. The corpus is unusually capacious, ranging from **predestination** to **marriage**, from **Spirit** to **creation**, yet marked by a single metaphysical and ecclesial conviction.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Levering’s **classical theism**, **divine simplicity**, **providence**, and even his insistence on **biblical dogmatics** will resonate, as will his critique of **theistic personalism** and moral revisionism in light of **law and gospel**. Yet principled tensions remain. His affirmation of **analogia entis** and a robust **nature-grace** schema risks, in Reformed judgment, diluting the noetic effects of sin and softening the **antithesis** that summons reason to be captive to **Scripture** alone as principium externum. His account of **Scripture and Tradition** as one economy under **Dei Verbum** conflicts with **sola scriptura** and the sufficiency of the **covenant canon**, and his defense of **sacramental mediation** as intrinsic to revelation challenges a Reformed focus on the **Word preached** as primary means of grace. On **justification**, his participatory emphasis on transformative righteousness stands at odds with **imputation** and the **extra nos** of **Calvins autotheos** and federal **covenant** logic, even while his Augustinian account of **grace** wins sympathy. Finally, on **predestination**, his Thomistic synthesis of **efficacious grace** and universal salvific will invites questions about the asymmetry of election and reprobation and the pastoral necessity of **particular redemption**. A Reformed alternative would commend **covenant theology** as the architectonic for uniting **Scripture**, **Christ**, and **church**, uphold **sola scriptura** as the proximate norm, anchor participation in **union with Christ** by the **Spirit** through faith alone, and locate **natural knowledge** within a suppressed yet inescapable **sensus divinitatis** that is clarified and corrected by the **Word**. Levering’s irenic Thomism thus stimulates serious dialogue, even as confessional differences in **revelation**, **grace**, and **sacrament** remain decisive.
