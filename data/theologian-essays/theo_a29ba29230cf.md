### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
William B. Evans emerges as a contemporary **Reformed** theologian shaped by the Associate Reformed Presbyterian Church and the broader late twentieth-century American Presbyterian conversation, where the centripetal forces of confessional **Westminster** orthodoxy met centrifugal pressures from **evangelicalism**, **biblical theology**, and ecumenical **ressourcement**. His institutional home in the Carolinas gave him access to a living confessional ethos, while his academic training oriented him toward historical-theological precision and biblical exegesis. The result is a method that unites historical retrieval with constructive dogmatics under the primacy of **union with Christ**, a theme that Evans treats as a load-bearing conceptual center for soteriology, ecclesiology, and sacramental theology. In contrast to reductionist schemas that oppose **forensic imputation** to moral transformation, Evans frames his project as a retrieval of **Calvin's duplex gratia**, insisting that the logic of union renders **justification** and **sanctification** inseparable though carefully distinguished.

Evans writes in a context inflected by controversy, notably the rise of **Federal Vision** and the challenge of the **New Perspective on Paul**. He resists the false choice between a purely forensic **Reformed scholasticism** and newer models that risk moralism or ecclesiocentrism, seeking instead a catholic Reformed synthesis that preserves legal grace while restoring participatory dynamics. His method is both historical and dogmatic: historical in its attention to **Athanasius**, **Irenaeus**, and early Reformed sources such as **Calvin** and **Vermigli**, and dogmatic in its insistence that doctrinal loci coinhere in the person of the crucified and risen Christ. The unifying pressure is **union with Christ** as the principium of the ordo salutis, an approach consonant with strands in **John Murray** and **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.** while developing a more explicit retrieval of patristic **theosis** language.

#### 2. Major works and the constructive thesis
Evans's central monograph, **Imputation and Impartation: Union with Christ, Justification, and the Nature of Salvation** published in 2008, is the pivot around which his broader oeuvre turns. There he advances two correlative claims. First, that a biblical and Reformed account of salvation must affirm the forensic glory of **imputation** as a non-negotiable entailment of the gospel. Second, that this forensic act is ordered to, and inseparable from, **impartation** of new life in **union with Christ** such that the duplex gift of **justification** and **sanctification** arises from the one Christ given by the Spirit. Evans argues that the tendency to handle imputation as a detachable transaction can drift into a thin moral nominalism, while exclusive focus on impartation collapses the legal into the transformative. His constructive alternative is a participatory account in which the believer's status and renewal coincide in the risen Christ, secured by the Spirit's bond of **unio mystica**.

In essays from 2007 through 2012, Evans extends this constructive thesis into two adjacent registers. First, he explores patristic **theosis** as a catholic grammar for **union with Christ**. Drawing on **Athanasius** and **Cyril of Alexandria**, he construes deification not as ontological absorption but as filial participation in the incarnate Son's life. The key anchor is the Reformed Christological axiom that the benefits of salvation are communicated via the person of the Mediator, so that participation is evangelical and covenantal rather than metaphysical speculation. Second, he addresses the **ordo salutis** in light of the historia salutis, suggesting with **Murray** and **Gaffin** that the traditional sequence should be reconfigured under the primacy of union, thereby safeguarding the simultaneity of **justification** and **adoption** with definitive **sanctification**. The upshot is a taxonomy where **imputation and impartation** are conjunctive aspects of the same union-derived grace rather than competitive causal tracks.

#### 3. Soteriology: imputation, impartation, and the duplex gratia
Evans's soteriology is intentionally resistant to both antinomian and moralist deformation. He embraces the classical **justification by faith alone** through the **imputed righteousness of Christ**, including the Reformed insistence on the necessity of Christ's **active obedience** for believers' righteousness. Yet he insists this forensic core be located within the personal scope of **union with Christ**, where the Spirit unites the elect to the crucified and risen Lord. Here he retrieves **Calvin's duplex gratia** as the architectonic: the same Christ gives **justification** as a declarative verdict and **sanctification** as the gift of renewal. The central polemic is against any bifurcation that would treat sanctification as an optional addendum to a forensic transaction. Evans maintains that the elect are not united to an abstraction called righteousness but to the righteous one, and thus to his Spirit-wrought **impartation** of new life.

The constructive work proceeds by clarifying linguistic usage. Evans contends that **imputation** names a genuinely forensic act that must not be diluted by moral infusion, while **impartation** designates the ontic renovation that flows from participation in Christ's resurrection life. The bond between the two is not an external coordination but an internal ordering: the one Christ is given to faith by the Spirit, and thus the verdict of acquittal and the power of renewal are inseparable acts of the one Lord. In this sense, **union with Christ** is not a tertium quid between decree and application but the personal mode of application itself, a reading aligned with **Gaffin's** ordo-in-union paradigm and consistent with the **Westminster Standards** on justification and sanctification as distinct yet inseparable benefits.

#### 4. Theosis and Reformed catholicity
Evans is notable among contemporary Reformed theologians for offering a carefully qualified retrieval of **theosis** as a way to stabilize Reformed participation language. His argument is historically grounded: the patristic theme of deification expressed the soteriological intuition that salvation is participation in the life of the Triune God through the incarnate Son and in the Spirit. Evans shows that early **Reformed** writers already employed participatory idioms, and that **Calvin** himself spoke richly of **unio mystica** and **adoptio** in a way consonant with filial participation, even if he avoided the Greek term. By resourcing **Athanasius** and the classic exchange formula, For he became what we are that we might become what he is, Evans positions **theosis** as a conceptual tool for articulating impartation without capitulating to ontological confusion. He anchors deification in **union with Christ** through the Spirit, regulated by **Scripture**, covenant, and the Creator-creature distinction.

This retrieval fuels a broader vision of **Reformed catholicity**. Evans resists any sectarian construal of Reformed identity as a mere system of propositions detached from the church's Eucharistic and creedal life. His forecasts for Reformed renewal include increased attention to the **creeds**, a robust account of the **means of grace**, and an ecumenical posture that learns from the Fathers while remaining tethered to **Westminster** confessional boundaries. In this respect his work bears comparison to efforts by **T. F. Torrance** to heal a forensic-ontological divide, though Evans guards more closely the confessional grammar of **imputation** and covenant. The net effect is an invitation to a catholic Reformed habitus that is as committed to **justification** as it is to the churchly practices that enact and nourish **union with Christ**.

#### 5. Sacraments and ecclesial embodiment
The sacramental dimension of Evans's work emerges from his emphasis on **sacramental realism** grounded in **union with Christ**. In essays around 2010, he contends that the **Lord's Supper** is not a bare memorial but an instrument of grace by which believers feed on Christ by the Spirit through faith. The focus is classic Reformed doctrine: the ascended Christ is truly present by the Spirit, such that worthy receivers partake of his body and blood in a real, though spiritual, mode. Evans presses this realism against reductive memorialism that often infiltrates evangelical practice. The stake here is ecclesiological as well as soteriological. If **impartation** is participation in Christ's risen life, the ordained means by which the Spirit binds and nourishes the body of Christ are the preaching of the **Word** and the **sacraments**, with the Supper occupying a central place in the church's sanctifying economy.

This sacramental emphasis informs Evans's ecclesial proposals. Drawing on strands from **Mercersburg** and classic **Presbyterian** theology, he urges a retrieval of weekly communion, catechesis ordered to **creedal** formation, and pastoral practice shaped by the **means of grace** rather than programmatic activism. The pastoral payoff of **union with Christ** is a ministry of Word and sacrament that cultivates the church's identity as the community incorporated into Christ's death and resurrection. Here again, the categories of **imputation and impartation** are not abstract but ecclesially embodied, with the Supper functioning as a site of participatory sanctification without compromising the once-for-all sufficiency of Christ's atonement.

#### 6. Covenant, ordo salutis, and contested terrains
Evans's system lives within the grammar of **covenant theology**, yet he refines how covenant frames the relationship between the historia and the ordo. Following **Murray** and **Vos**, he argues that the application of redemption is an outflow of the history of redemption, so that the individual believer's salvation is a participation in the once-for-all victory of Christ. This informs his preference for an ordo that is not an abstract sequence but a depiction of benefits given in the one **union with Christ**. The order may be described logically rather than temporally, with **effectual calling**, **regeneration**, **faith**, **justification**, and **adoption** coinherent, and **sanctification** both definitive and progressive. The controlling point is not to collapse categories but to retain their mutual implication in Christ.

Evans navigates the **Federal Vision** controversy by distinguishing his union-centered catholicity from that movement's ambiguities. He affirms covenant objectivity and sacramental seriousness, but he rejects any blurring of the decree-grace nexus that would compromise the perseverance of the saints or the instrumentality of **faith alone**. Similarly, he engages the **New Perspective on Paul** with gratitude for fresh historical insight while defending the classic **Reformed** understanding of justification as a forensic verdict grounded in the alien righteousness of Christ. His criticism of both trends is consistent: when covenant identity or new-historical readings marginalize the centrality of **imputation**, the gospel's judicial relief is imperiled; when forensic grace is abstracted from **union**, sanctification is diminished to bare moral effort. Evans's constructive reframing aims to secure both the verdict and the transformative communion.

#### 7. Scripture, exegesis, and theological interpretation
A signal feature of Evans's work is his respect for **Scripture** as the principium cognoscendi of theology. His retrieval of **union with Christ** and **theosis** is not driven by romantic nostalgia but by exegetical claims rooted in Pauline theology. He reads texts like Romans 5 to 8 and Galatians 2 and 3 as establishing the integral link between participation in Christ and the righteous status of the believer, such that the *in Christo* motif governs both **justification** and **sanctification**. His stress on **adoption** as a coprimary benefit aligns with this scriptural grammar. Likewise his sacramental realism is exegetically motivated by texts such as 1 Corinthians 10 and 11, where participation in the body and blood of Christ is described with thick covenanted realism. In this mode he embodies a Reformed **theological interpretation of Scripture** that refuses to separate dogmatics from exegesis.

This exegetical posture is conjoined with a chastened account of reason. Evans operates with a kind of theological critical realism: reason is ministerial, not magisterial, and the church's theological task is to confess what **Scripture** teaches with the help of the **creeds** and confessions. He therefore resists rationalist harmonizations that deflate the mystery of **union with Christ**, even while insisting on the clarity of the doctrines of **imputation** and **adoption**. The balance is scholastic without scholasticism: he honors distinctions and conceptual clarity while insisting that the living Christ is the locus of all soteriological benefits.

#### 8. Influence, reception, and ongoing debates
Evans has influenced pastors and scholars who seek a thicker **Reformed** catholicity, especially in Presbyterian and Associate Reformed circles. His language of **imputation and impartation** has provided a pedagogical bridge in seminary and church settings where students and congregants need clarity on how **justification** relates to **sanctification**. His retrieval of **theosis** has sparked constructive conversations on whether and how classic deification themes can be owned within **Reformed** confessional boundaries. In the sacramental domain, his essays have emboldened pastors to recover **sacramental realism** and to repair the gap between formal Reformed doctrine and thin evangelical practice. The effect is incremental but notable: a renewed interest in **union with Christ** as the architectonic principle of preaching and catechesis, and a less polarized discourse regarding **Federal Vision** and the **New Perspective**.

Reception has also generated critique. Some confessionalists worry that the rhetoric of **impartation** and **theosis** may smuggle an ontological account of righteousness into **justification**, or that union-first ordering might obscure the legal priority of **imputation** in the act of justification. Others caution that sacramental retrieval can, in practice, approximate the high-church templates of **Mercersburg** or Anglo-Catholicism. Evans addresses these concerns by reiterating the formal distinctness of **justification** as a once-for-all forensic act and by underlining the indispensability of **faith alone** as the sole instrumental cause of receiving Christ, while continuing to argue that the believer never receives a benefit apart from the Benefactor.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary angle, Evans's project offers real gifts and some tensions. His insistence on **union with Christ** as the principial category is a salutary development that corroborates key emphases in **Vos**, **Murray**, and **Gaffin**. His affirmation of the forensic center of the gospel, the necessity of Christ's **active and passive obedience**, and the instrumentality of **faith alone** aligns with the **Westminster Standards**. His sacramental seriousness retrieves the Reformed doctrine of **spiritual presence** against memorialism and is pastorally valuable. Yet two cautions arise. First, in soteriological ordering, great care is needed to maintain the categorical distinctness and legal priority of **justification** by **imputation** within the ordo, lest participatory language blur efficient and formal causes. A constructive alternative is to speak of the duplex gratia as simultaneous gifts of union while preserving the asymmetry that the legal verdict grounds assurance in a way not shared by progressive **sanctification**. Second, with respect to **theosis**, the Reformed confessional grammar is best protected by restricting deification to the sphere of **sanctification** and **adoption**, while refusing any idiom that might imply an ontological communication of divine attributes. Within these guardrails, Evans's **Reformed catholicity** can be received as an edifying retrieval that strengthens the church's grasp of the gospel's breadth without sacrificing its forensic depth.
