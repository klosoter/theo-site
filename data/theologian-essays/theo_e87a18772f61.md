### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the wager of method
Kenton L. Sparks emerges within late modern **evangelicalism** at the point where the **historical-critical method** had long won the academy but continued to trouble the church. Trained in the **Ancient Near East** and **Old Testament** at a major research university in the United States and serving at **Eastern University** and **Palmer Theological Seminary**, Sparks inhabits the institutional crossroads where confessional commitments meet public scholarship. The backdrop is the evangelical consolidation around the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978 and the subsequent **postconservative** efforts to loosen its grip. Sparks’s wager is that one can practice unconstrained **critical scholarship** while sustaining a robust doctrine of **Scripture**, if the doctrine is rearticulated around **divine accommodation**, an **incarnational analogy**, and a **chastened critical realism**. The essential claim is that God speaks truly through texts that are, by every ordinary historical measure, humanly limited and sometimes wrong.

The early intellectual impulses of Sparks’s project draw on **Alvin Plantinga** and **Nicholas Wolterstorff** for epistemic humility and a theistic account of rationality, while incorporating the sensibilities of **James Barr** regarding biblical **fundamentalism** and its defensive harmonizations. He understands **historical criticism** not as an alien imposition but as a providentially available tool within God’s world. Consequently, Sparks treats **ANE comparanda**, **genre criticism**, and **source/redaction analysis** as ordinary means by which Christians can understand Scripture’s human discourse. The theological ballast for this move is **divine concursus** and **accommodation**, which set the conditions for an **errant inspiration** that does not jeopardize authority because authority is finally **ecclesial** and **Christological**, not tethered to a modernist ideal of **inerrancy**.

#### 2. Ancient contexts and the logic of comparison
Sparks’s **Ancient Texts for the Study of the Hebrew Bible** in 2005 showcases the comparative scaffold of his entire vision. The book maps the **literary, legal, historical, and religious corpora** of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Anatolia, and the Levant to equip readers for serious **intertextual** work. The thesis is not reductionist sameness but **family resemblance** across **ANE genres** that makes Israel’s Scriptures intelligible. Where conservative readers might fear erosion of **revelation**, Sparks contends that the God of **providence** always speaks in a people’s language, which includes shared **cosmologies**, **historiographies**, and **legal forms**. The implication is as direct as it is controversial: if Israel’s texts sometimes mirror **mythic cosmography**, stylized **royal ideology**, or **ancient historiographical conventions**, then Christians should expect Scripture to share the limitations of those idioms without losing its **theological vocation**.

The broader methodological upshot is his consistent resistance to **harmonization** as a first-order hermeneutic. Sparks argues that careful attention to **genre** and **ancient conventions** explains many perceived discrepancies while leaving others intact. For the latter, he refuses to violate the data to save a theory of **inerrancy**, proposing instead that **truthfulness** is tied to God’s communicative intention through fallible human agents. In this, he counters the **B. B. Warfield** legacy by reframing **verbal plenary inspiration** as a theological intuition about **God’s speech** rather than a guarantee of exhaustive factual precision. The moral of the story is that **ANE backgrounds** are not opponents but allies when studying the **Hebrew Bible**.

#### 3. God’s Word in Human Words: the constructive proposal
The center of Sparks’s constructive contribution is **God’s Word in Human Words** in 2008. Here he develops an **incarnational model of Scripture**, where the analogy is designed to be instructive but not exhaustive: as the eternal Son assumed a **real human nature** with cultural and cognitive location, so the divine Word assumes human discourse with its real cultural and cognitive limitations. Sparks deploys a **chastened critical realism**, acknowledging the underdetermination of evidence and the fallibility of interpreters, yet asserting the public rationality of historical judgments. This epistemic stance opens the door to affirming **pseudepigraphy** in certain biblical books, **composite authorship**, **redactional layering**, and historically conditioned perspectives without anxiety that such findings falsify **inspiration**.

The book’s critique of evangelical **inerrancy** is careful but decisive. Sparks contends that the **Chicago Statement** codifies a particular modern account of **truth** and **language** poorly suited to diverse ancient genres. He emphasizes a theology of **canon** rooted in **ecclesial reception** under divine **providence**: the church received these texts as instruments of the Spirit’s instruction, not because they passed modern tests of precision but because they function within the **rule of faith** and lead to Christ. The doctrine of **Scripture** is thus oriented to its **teleology** in the economy of salvation rather than to an a priori quality control. Sparks prefers to speak of **authority** rather than inerrancy, where authority is the Spirit’s living use of the canon to form the people of God.

#### 4. Sacred Word, Broken Word: accommodation, ethics, and judgment
In **Sacred Word, Broken Word** from 2012, Sparks confronts the ethical thorns of the canon, especially **herem warfare**, **slavery**, and **misogyny**. His claim is stark: some biblical texts not only fall short of the gospel but are in tension with the character of God revealed in Jesus Christ. The theological engine is an expansive **doctrine of accommodation**. God, Sparks argues, stooped to speak through Israel’s **fallen moral horizon**, permitting, and therefore enscripturating, views and practices that the trajectory of redemption will later relativize or repudiate. This is joined to a **Christocentric criterion** that functions as a canon within the canon, where the teaching and praxis of **Jesus** and the apostolic **kerygma** provide the standard to evaluate earlier biblical voices.

The hermeneutical instrument here is a **redemptive trajectory** or **progressive revelation** model akin to proposals by **James Barr** and later evangelical ethicists. Sparks urges pastors and theologians to acknowledge the **brokenness** of certain texts rather than to rehabilitate them through legalistic **harmonization** or strained **defenses**. By telling the truth about the text’s humanity, one safeguards the church’s moral witness and deepens the testimony to **grace**, since God faithfully uses compromised human words to save. The canonical unity is eschatological and Christological, not the unity of flat moral equivalence across covenants.

#### 5. Interlocutors, debates, and clarifications
Sparks’s closest intellectual neighbor is **Peter Enns** and his **Inspiration and Incarnation** trajectory, which similarly advocates an **incarnational analogy** and frank engagement with **critical scholarship**. Sparks differentiates himself by pressing further into **ecclesiology** and **canon** as the theater of **authority** and by more openly affirming **error** in Scripture. His arguments draw appreciative notice from scholars sympathetic to **critical realism** like **N. T. Wright** in historiography and from analytic theologians like **Plantinga** who grant epistemic fallibilism within a theistic frame, even if they do not endorse Sparks’s conclusions about **inerrancy**. On the other side, evangelical theologians such as **Kevin Vanhoozer** and biblical scholars allied to the **ETS** have challenged Sparks’s rejection of **inerrancy**, proposing **speech-act theory** as a way to reconceive **truthfulness** across genre without conceding error.

Sparks’s dialogue with the **Warfield** tradition is direct: he accepts the **two authors** doctrine and **concursus** but denies that divine authorship secures an error-free text in every respect. He appeals to **Calvin’s** robust **accommodatio** to legitimate this denial, though his reading widens accommodation from idiom and pedagogy to include erroneous judgments. Sparks also resists the charge of **Marcionism** by insisting that his **Christological criterion** does not excise Israel’s Scripture but reads it as a complex witness in need of **moral discernment** under the Spirit. The result is a proposal self-consciously situated in a line from **Augustine’s** admission of interpretive fallibility to modern **critical realism**, yet it is more radical in its attributions of fallibility to the text itself.

#### 6. Science, origins, and the scope of providence
Beyond textual criticism and hermeneutics, Sparks has written for broader audiences on **science and faith**, notably in **BioLogos** venues, aligning with **evolutionary creation** and reading **Genesis** in light of **ANE cosmology**. The method remains stable: one embraces the best available **scientific accounts** of origins, recognizes that **ancient cosmography** shapes biblical creation language, and thereby frees the church from **concordist** misreadings. Sparks suggests that the figure of **Adam** functions within ancient Israel’s theological idiom and need not bear the weight of modern biological universalism. The doctrine of **providence** thereby grounds a confidence that God’s redemptive work in Christ does not depend on scientific or historical concord at every point but on the **Spirit’s** use of Scripture to direct the people of God toward **wisdom** and **salvation**.

Here again, Sparks leverages **accommodation** and **genre** to explain why the Bible speaks in prescientific terms while maintaining **authority**. He urges that evangelicals exchange anxiety about **inerrancy** for patience in **interpretation**, allowing **general revelation** and **special revelation** to be mutually clarifying under the sovereignty of God. The guiding conviction is that theological truth is compatible with human fallibility in the textual vehicles that convey it, and that **Christ** rather than any particular cosmological scheme is the hermeneutical fulcrum.

#### 7. Systematic stakes: authority, canon, and ecclesial judgment
At the systematic level, Sparks’s doctrine of **Scripture** pivots on three claims: first, that **inspiration** is a form of **divine concursus** with finite and fallen human discourse that does not override its limitations; second, that **authority** is fundamentally **ecclesial** and **Christological**, located in the Spirit’s living use of the canon to form the church; and third, that **canon** is secured by **providence** through **ecclesial reception** rather than by post hoc proofs of uniform accuracy. The upshot is an explicit endorsement of **errancy** at the level of incidental facts and even some ethical judgments, joined to a high account of Scripture’s **efficacy** in the economy of salvation.

In practice, this yields a **hermeneutic of humility** that prizes **genre**, **context**, and **critical inquiry** while also affirming the **rule of faith**. Sparks resists a **deductive biblicism** that treats proof texts as timeless propositions and instead reads canonically with a **Christocentric telos**. Yet the Christocentrism functions as a **criterion**, not only as a fulfillment pattern: he is willing to say that some biblical voices are relativized or corrected by the greater light of **Christ and the apostles**. This position reframes **sola Scriptura** as Scripture-in-church under Christ, rather than Scripture as a uniform manual of propositional truths. The canon’s unity is thus a unity of **narrative arc** and **eschatological direction**, not a nonconflictual harmony at every textual seam.

#### 8. Reception and impact within evangelicalism and beyond
Sparks’s ideas have catalyzed wide discussion in evangelical classrooms, publishers, and scholarly societies. **God’s Word in Human Words** and **Sacred Word, Broken Word** are now regular conversation partners in courses on **bibliology**, **hermeneutics**, and **ethics**. Some appreciate his courage to tell the truth about **textual phenomena**, commending his **critical realism** as pastorally liberating for students disillusioned by brittle **inerrantist** models. Others warn that his model destabilizes **doctrinal authority** and weakens confidence in **Scripture’s trustworthiness**. Sparks’s courteous but firm rejection of **Chicago-style inerrancy** places him alongside a stream of evangelical and post-evangelical scholars seeking new dogmatic accounts for a postcritical age.

Beyond evangelical circles, Sparks’s work is conversant with mainline **historical-critical** theology and intersects with **Barthian** instincts about **Christological normativity** while stopping short of **Barth’s** doctrine of the Word as event. He remains a realist about texts, not a pure **actualist**. His hands-on proficiency with **ANE literature** grants his theological claims a philological seriousness often lacking in more purely systematic proposals. Whether one agrees with his conclusions or not, Sparks has helped normalize an honest accounting of **pseudepigraphy**, **composite composition**, and **historical tensions** for students who confess the **Apostles Creed** without adjudicating all textual puzzles in advance.

#### 9. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Sparks’s project contains significant strengths alongside critical liabilities. Positively, his insistence on **genre sensitivity**, **ANE context**, and a chastened **critical realism** can purify confessional exegesis from naive **proof-texting** and modernist **foundationalism**. His appeal to **divine concursus** and **accommodation** reflects genuine catholic instincts, and his **Christocentric** focus on the canon’s teleology echoes **Vosian** **redemptive-historical** method. However, by construing **accommodation** to include divinely intended error and by elevating a **Christological criterion** that functionally creates a **canon within the canon**, Sparks conflicts with the **Westminster Confession** on the **inspiration** and **infallible truth** of Scripture. Classical Reformed theology, from **Calvin** through **Bavinck** and **Warfield**, embraces **organic inspiration** and **self-attestation** (**autopistia**) to affirm that the same God who orders nature **providentially** also rules the composition of Scripture so that it is, in all that it affirms according to its intended sense and **genre**, wholly true. A Reformed alternative would combine Sparks’s attentiveness to **ANE genres** and **ethical development** with a stronger doctrine of **verbal plenary inspiration**, refusing to resolve hard texts by attributing **error** to God’s Word but instead reading them within the **covenantal** and **eschatological** fabric where typology, promise-fulfillment, and the **analogia fidei** preserve both moral seriousness and canonical coherence. On this view, **accommodation** concerns form and mode, not the divine will to teach falsehood, and **Christ** fulfills and refracts earlier revelation without disqualifying it as Scripture. Sparks’s proposal rightly seeks integrity before the facts, but it risks undercutting the church’s confidence that the Bible’s **authority** is inseparable from its **truth**.
