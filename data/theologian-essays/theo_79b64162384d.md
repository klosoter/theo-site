### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Context, and Method
Born in 1970 in Ontario, **James K. A. Smith** emerges from a Canadian **Pentecostal** milieu into the **Neo-Calvinist** world, studying at the **Institute for Christian Studies in Toronto** where **Dooyeweerdian Reformational philosophy** crafts a posture of anti-neutrality toward culture and knowledge. A doctorate at **Villanova University** under **John D. Caputo** immerses him in **Continental phenomenology** and **deconstruction**, broadening his dialogue with **Derrida**, **Merleau-Ponty**, and **Augustine**. The trajectory lands at **Calvin University** where Smith serves as the **Byker Chair in Applied Reformed Theology and Worldview**, curates public intellectual work with **Cardus** and later as editor of **Image Journal**, and constructs an agenda that refracts **Kuyperian sphere sovereignty** through a late-modern lens. His formative proposal is a synthesis of **Augustinian desire**, **phenomenological embodiment**, and **Reformational antithesis**, aimed at articulating a **creational account of culture** within the strictures of **secular modernity**.

Smith calls his stance an **Augustinian phenomenology**, a method that joins **ordo amoris** to **embodied practice**. He resists **foundationalism** not with skepticism but with a **postfoundational confidence** rooted in **creaturely finitude**. Humans are not disembodied rational choosers but **lovers first**, a thesis that destabilizes intellectualist habits in some **Reformed worldview** discourse. Drawing on **Bourdieu's habitus** and **MacIntyre's virtue ethics**, he reconceives knowledge as traditioned practice, saturated by **liturgical formation**. This is not a retreat from truth but a relocation of **epistemic agency** into **ecclesial worship** and **thick communal practices**, an approach that binds **theology**, **philosophy**, and **cultural criticism** into a single program.

#### 2. The Creational Hermeneutic and Postmodern Engagements
Smith's early landmark, **The Fall of Interpretation** 2000 and its expanded 2012 edition, sets the hermeneutical foundation. He contends that **interpretation belongs to creaturely finitude**, a structural good of creation rather than a mere effect of sin, though the fall disorders this gift. The alternative to **pretended God's-eye neutrality** is a **creational hermeneutic** oriented by **grace**, where ecclesial tradition is not an obstacle but a divinely provided medium of understanding. Against the charge that postmodern philosophy erodes **Scripture's authority**, Smith argues that the church's interpretive dependence on the **Spirit** and the **communion of saints** is a condition for fidelity to **biblical canon**, not a betrayal of **sola Scriptura**. Here **Augustine's doctrina christiana**, **Dooyeweerd's religious ground-motive**, and **Merleau-Ponty's embodiment** converge in a constructive posture that is both **Reformed** and **continental**.

This constructive stance explains Smith's critical sympathy for **Radical Orthodoxy**, introduced in **Introducing Radical Orthodoxy** 2004. He appreciates **John Milbank** and **Catherine Pickstock** for their **sacramental ontology** and critique of **secular reason**, yet he seeks a **Reformational** alternative that preserves **creation's goodness** without swallowing nature into grace. The accessible **Who’s Afraid of Postmodernism** 2006 reframes **Derrida**, **Lyotard**, and **Foucault** as unexpectedly useful for the church, provided that their insights are disciplined by **Scripture** and **tradition**. Later, **Who’s Afraid of Relativism** 2014 reads **Wittgenstein**, **Rorty**, and **Sellars** as allies in dethroning Cartesian certainty while maintaining **covenantal truthfulness** secured in **ecclesial practices**. The consistent target is **modern autonomy** and **foundationalism**, the positive vision is **traditioned discernment** animated by **agapic desire**.

#### 3. Cultural Liturgies and Liturgical Anthropology
Smith's signature contribution unfolds in the **Cultural Liturgies** trilogy. In **Desiring the Kingdom** 2009 he names humans **homo liturgicus**, creatures of love whose imaginations are formed by **rituals** and **habits** before they articulate **worldviews**. Against thin rationalism he argues that **liturgy** is a pedagogy of desire. Secular institutions are not neutral but conduct **liturgies** that direct ultimate longings, from the **mall** with its sacramentalized consumption to the **university** with its gospel of autonomous inquiry to the **nation-state** with its civic eucharist. In **Imagining the Kingdom** 2013 he draws on **Merleau-Ponty's body schema** and **Bourdieu's habitus** to explain how **affective registers** and **narrative rituals** seep beneath cognition to shape action. Finally **Awaiting the King** 2017 expands into **political theology**, proposing the church as an **ecclesial polis** whose worship constitutes a public, with an **Augustinian critique of liberalism** that resists both withdrawal and triumphalism.

The anthropology is unmistakably **Augustinian**. The heart is an erotic engine oriented by an **ordo amoris**, and **worship** recalibrates that engine through **sacrament** and **Word**. Smith stresses **sacramental realism** as a corrective to disembodied doctrinalism while refusing to collapse **doctrine** into mere ritual. His concept of **cultural liturgies** offers pastors and educators a framework for holistic **Christian formation** where catechesis, preaching, Eucharist, music, architecture, and even architecture of time through the **liturgical calendar** participate in the Spirit's re-habituation of the saints. The resulting ecclesiology is thick, a **polis** marked by **virtues**, **practices**, and **traditions** that bear a distinctive public.

#### 4. Secular Age, Augustine, and Popular Pedagogy
Smith's guide to **Charles Taylor**, **How Not to Be Secular** 2014, baptized a generation of pastors and students into the grammar of **A Secular Age**. Concepts like the **immanent frame**, **subtraction stories**, **cross pressures**, and the pursuit of **fullness** become catechetical tools. Smith reframes the apologetic task as **cultural diagnosis** and **imaginative invitation** rather than syllogistic demonstration, echoing **Augustine's** insight that the heart must be wooed. The popular **You Are What You Love** 2016 distills **cultural liturgies** into parish pedagogy, urging the intentional curation of **habits**, **household practices**, and **congregational rhythms** to counter secular formation.

The existential turn culminates in **On the Road with Saint Augustine** 2019, a spiritual and intellectual pilgrimage through **Augustinian themes** of **restlessness**, **friendship**, **ambition**, **fatherhood**, and **home**. Here the philosophical scaffolding meets narrative concretion, embodying his insistence that **theology** is not a detached science but a path of **discipleship**. The anchors remain **Augustine**, **Taylor**, and **Kuyper**, yet the tone is pastoral, aiming at hearts as well as minds. Smith thereby embodies the thesis that **imagination** precedes **intellection**, a thesis he believes is thoroughly **Reformed** in its Augustinian core.

#### 5. Pentecostal Philosophy and the Pneumatological Turn
With **Thinking in Tongues** 2010 Smith advances a **Pentecostal contribution to philosophy**, bringing **pneumatology** into epistemology, ontology, and aesthetics. He proposes a **Spirit-suffused account** of knowledge that attends to **affect**, **embodied praise**, and **charismata**, thereby widening the analytic lens of **Reformed theology** beyond a narrow rationalism. The horizon is a **sacramental ontology** that refuses a closed disenchanted world. This turn deepens his **cultural liturgies** project by insisting that the plausibility structure of Christian faith is not finally an argument but a **Spirit-formed habitus**, a thick ecology of **prayer**, **song**, **table**, and **Scripture**.

In dialogue with **Kuyper** and **Dooyeweerd**, Smith avoids sacralizing the secular. Instead he proposes a **creational affirmation** of culture under the rule of **Christ**, refusing both **sectarian retreat** and **liberal accommodation**. The **Spirit** is the agent of cultural discernment who empowers the church to inhabit multiple spheres without illusion of neutrality. This pneumatological accent is a hallmark of Smith's **Neo-Calvinist** revision, distinguishing it from purely juridical or confessional modes.

#### 6. The Nicene Option and Catholicity
The collected essays in **The Nicene Option** 2018 press for **creedal catholicity** and an **incarnational phenomenology**. Smith urges **Reformed** communities to retrieve the **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** grammar as the metaphysical trellis for **sacramental realism** and **liturgical practice**. The wager is that **Christological** and **Trinitarian** confession furnishes ontology enough to resist both **disenchantment** and **immanent reduction**. His **incarnational phenomenology** acknowledges the grain of the world as created in and through the **Logos**, thereby legitimating the density of **material practices** and **aesthetic** registers in worship. Smith's appeal to **catholicity** is not a capitulation to **Roman Catholic** hegemony but a **Reformed ressourcement** in service of **ecumenical orthodoxy**.

This retrieval pushes beyond **worldview** as a cognitive set to **worship** as doxological knowing. In so doing Smith provokes debate within **Reformed theology** about the relationship between **confession**, **catechesis**, and **sacrament**. He insists they are inseparable, and that the church's public truthfulness is indexed by its **liturgy**, not only by its **doctrinal statements**. The emphasis is Augustinian and Kuyperian at once, betting that **thick communal practices** are both epistemic and evangelistic in a secular milieu.

#### 7. Scripture, Authority, and Hermeneutics Revisited
Returning to **hermeneutics**, the second edition of **The Fall of Interpretation** 2012 clarifies the place of **Scripture** and **tradition**. Smith rejects **biblicism** understood as a naive immediacy that ignores the church's historically extended agency. He argues for **ecclesial exegesis** where the **rule of faith**, **canon**, and **worship** shape interpretive posture. The aim is not to displace **sola Scriptura** but to interpret it as **suprema Scriptura**, Scripture as the supreme authority that always already calls forth **communal practices** of reception. He draws instructive contrasts with **Kevin Vanhoozer's drama of doctrine**, affirming **theodramatic** imagination while urging that the actors learn lines by bodily **habituation** not just cognitive rehearsal.

This approach also reorients **apologetics**. The plausibility of revelation is not aridly staged in a neutral court but enacted in **ecclesial performance** that renders the gospel intelligible. The claim is Augustinian and missional. **Love** is the mode of knowledge because the **Spirit** conforms lovers to **Christ** through **rites** and **rhythms**. The hermeneutical fallenness of interpretation is healed by grace, not erased, so that the eschatological end of exegesis remains **beatific communion** rather than disembodied certainty.

#### 8. Public Theology and Political Augustinianism
In **Awaiting the King** 2017 Smith advances an **Augustinian political theology** that dethrones **liberalism's proceduralism**. The church is a **polis** whose worship constitutes a counter-public, not simply a voluntary association of private believers. He threads a via media between **Constantinianism** and **sectarianism**, endorsing **principled pluralism** alongside candid **confessional witness**. Public life is not neutrally secular but thickly moral, coded by rival **liturgies** in markets, media, and civic rites. The ethical life requires **virtue formation** rooted in **sacrament** and **catechesis**, thereby exporting the gains of **cultural liturgies** into political discipleship.

Smith's political wager entails a different apologetic posture. Rather than demand a mythical **neutral public square**, he commends faithful presence that neither hides confession nor imposes it. The church is a workshop of **public virtue**, sent into various spheres under the **lordship of Christ** with wisdom for the common good. The tone is Kuyperian yet chastened by **Augustinian realism** about disordered loves, and by **Taylor's** diagnosis of late-modern cross-pressures. The church awaits the **King**, and its patience is political.

#### 9. Influence and Reception
Smith's influence radiates through **Christian higher education**, **pastoral ministry**, and **worship renewal**. The language of **cultural liturgies**, the diagnosis of the **immanent frame**, and the pedagogy of **habits** have become near commonplaces in evangelical discourse. He models a public intellectual life that toggles between scholarly monographs and accessible essays, between **Augustinian retrieval** and **cultural criticism**. Admirers applaud his demolition of **rationalist intellectualism**, his constructive **liturgical anthropology**, and his deft translation of **Charles Taylor** for ministry. Many within **Neo-Calvinism** celebrate his expansion of **Kuyper** beyond worldview to worship, a move that re-centers **ecclesiology**.

Critics persist, especially from confessional **Reformed** quarters. Some worry that **liturgy** outshines **doctrine**, that **sacramental ontology** veers toward a **Romanizing** idiom, or that **postfoundational hermeneutics** undercut the **perspicuity of Scripture**. Others contest his Augustinian political option, preferring **two-kingdoms** frameworks or **natural law** as common grammar for public life. Smith has responded by underscoring his commitment to **sola Scriptura**, the **Reformed confessions**, and the **means of grace**, while continuing to insist that **worship** is the primary school of love.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS Evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Smith's body of work yields substantial gifts alongside notable tensions. His Augustinian insistence that humans are lovers, his exposure of **mythic neutrality**, and his retrieval of **ecclesial practices** as formative are profound correctives to rationalist distortions in modern evangelicalism. The emphasis on **noetic effects of sin**, **antithesis**, and **traditioned knowing** sits comfortably with **Van Tilian** insights about **analogical knowledge** and **covenantal epistemology**. Yet cautions are in order. First, the polemic against intellectualism sometimes risks eclipsing **dogmatic content**, as if truth were reducible to practice, which would imperil **propositional revelation** and the **perspicuity of Scripture**. A WTS corrective would integrate **liturgical formation** with clear **catechesis**, guarding the primacy of **Word and sacrament** as divinely instituted **means of grace** rather than broader cultural practices that approximate sacramental status. Second, Smith's **postfoundational hermeneutic** could be sharpened by stronger emphasis on **Scripture's self-attesting authority** and the **internal testimony of the Spirit**, thereby avoiding any slide into communal conventionalism. Third, his **political theology** presses against **two-kingdoms** prudence and the use of **natural law** as a common grammar, which many in the Reformed tradition have prized to secure neighbor love in plural contexts. An alternative trajectory would pair his Augustinian diagnosis of disordered loves with a more articulate embrace of **common grace**, **creational norms**, and a principled distinction between **church as institute** and **church as organism**. None of these tensions negate the deep value of Smith's project. They invite a Reformed reception that prizes his **liturgical anthropology** and **secular age** diagnostics while re-centering confessionally rich **dogmatics**, a robust doctrine of **revelation**, and a calibrated **public theology** under the sovereign **lordship of Christ**.
