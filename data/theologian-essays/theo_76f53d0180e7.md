### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to infrastructure
The work of **Brett M. Frischmann** emerges from the thick of early twenty-first century **digital capitalism** and the policy churn over **intellectual property**, **internet governance**, and **surveillance**. Trained in law and economics and teaching at **Cardozo School of Law** by 2012 before moving to **Villanova University** from 2016, he positioned himself at the junction of **institutional design**, **technology policy**, and the **commons** tradition. The intellectual backdrop includes **Elinor Ostrom's** Nobel-canonized theory of polycentric governance, the **Lessig** claim that code is law, and a broader critique of **market fundamentalism** in information policy. Frischmann reads the modern information ecosystem through the lens of **infrastructure**, arguing that the public character of shared enabling resources constitutes a moral as well as economic stake in the *bonum commune*. His project is not explicitly theological, yet it is freighted with theologies of the **human person**, **autonomy**, and **flourishing**, and thus invites translation into categories like **imago Dei**, **stewardship**, and **natural law**.

Frischmann's formation is marked by an allergy to totalizing abstractions in **law and economics** and a preference for mid-level institutional analysis. This yields a method that is iterative, empirical, and humble about complex systems. It rejects the austerity of welfare maximization as a sole metric and insists on **value pluralism** in public policy. The shift from viewing resources as commodities to seeing them as **infrastructure commons** introduces a crucial reframing of **externalities** as constitutive spillovers for social learning rather than mere market failures. In this setting, the governance challenge becomes how to preserve openness and generativity so that downstream users can create unanticipated goods. Theologically, this bears on the ordering of common life under **creation norms**, hinting at a secular analogue to **lex naturalis** in which enabling structures channel human making toward *ordo amoris*.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
The core method in **Frischmann's** corpus is **pragmatic institutionalism** applied to shared resources with high **positive spillovers**. His 2012 architecture in **Infrastructure: The Social Value of Shared Resources** elaborates an account of infrastructure as systems of resources and governance that enable productive activity without dictating ends. The key is to distinguish stock from flow, upstream facilitation from downstream creativity, and to recognize the incommensurability of values catalyzed by *open* infrastructures. He deploys an **Ostromian** case-study sensibility but recasts it for infrastructures that are often nonrival and nonexcludable, such as **roads**, **communications networks**, **environmental systems**, and the **internet**. The epistemic stance is anti-solutionist and wary of technocracy, prioritizing **polycentric governance**, **public-regarding design**, and long-run **generativity** over short-term efficiency.

This method contains a normative core that is candid though nonconfessional. The goods he seeks to preserve are **autonomy**, **dignity**, **creativity**, and participatory **self-governance**. These goods are threatened by enclosure and over-optimization that convert infrastructures into narrow pipelines for extraction. The evaluative grammar is secular, yet it resonates with theological concerns for **ordered liberty**, neighbor-regarding **justice**, and the cultivation of **virtue** in social ecologies. The method assumes a modest but real moral knowledge accessible through empirical inquiry and practical reason, which aligns with strands of **natural law** while remaining agnostic about metaphysical groundings.

#### 3. Infrastructure: The Social Value of Shared Resources 2012
In **Infrastructure** 2012, Frischmann advances the thesis that certain resource systems should be governed as **infrastructure commons** to maximize the production of socially valuable **spillovers**. Infrastructure here is defined functionally as shared enabling platforms whose value lies in downstream uses that are difficult to foresee or measure. He argues that policies which preserve openness and broad access in domains like **transportation**, **communications**, and **environmental services** create option value for the whole polity. The book critiques single-metric **cost-benefit analysis** and narrow **property-rights** expansion, showing how enclosure can choke off **innovation**, **expression**, and **civic association**.

The argument is illustrated with familiar domains. In **roads and rights-of-way**, nondiscriminatory access supports entrepreneurship and community formation. In **the internet**, common carriage norms and end-to-end architecture have historically fostered unplanned creativity. In **environmental infrastructure**, wetlands and watersheds generate diffuse benefits difficult to capture in markets. Frischmann therefore recommends governance modes that blend public provision, commons management, and carefully constrained exclusion. Theologically, the vision suggests a doctrine of infrastructure as creaturely **mediations of providence** that channel common life toward **flourishing**, echoing a civic form of the **cultural mandate** that refuses to instrumentalize every shared good.

#### 4. Governing Knowledge Commons 2014 and medical extensions
With **Michael J. Madison** and **Katherine J. Strandburg**, Frischmann edited **Governing Knowledge Commons** in 2014, building a research framework for empirical study of **knowledge commons**. This work resists the facile tragedy narrative by asking how communities actually craft rules for shared information resources. The framework catalogues attributes of communities, resources, rules-in-use, and outcomes across domains like **open source software**, **Wikipedia**, and **scientific data**. The implicit normative thesis is that governance must fit the sociotechnical ecology rather than default to enclosure or deregulation.

The medical volumes **Governing Medical Knowledge Commons** in 2017 and 2019 extend the approach to health data, biobanks, and translational research. Here Frischmann and collaborators confront the entanglement of **privacy**, **ethics**, **proprietary claims**, and **public health**. The case studies vindicate his anti-solutionist method while surfacing thick moral tensions. Knowledge is both a shared infrastructure and a domain of vulnerability requiring safeguards for dignity. Again the conceptual anchors are **polycentric governance**, **openness with responsibility**, and the preservation of downstream generativity. A theological reader can hear clear resonance with **common grace** enabling shared scientific labor and with **neighbor-love** requiring constraints to protect the weak.

#### 5. Speech, spillovers, and the public sphere
Throughout his corpus and in associated articles on **speech** and **externalities**, **Frischmann** argues that the value of expression is intertwined with **spillovers** that saturate the public sphere. The defense of infrastructural openness in communications is, for him, a defense of the unplanned, cumulative processes by which societies learn and deliberate. He reframes **First Amendment** discourse away from atomistic rights toward **infrastructural conditions** that sustain free inquiry and civic life. The distinctive contribution is to tie **freedom of expression** to the design of **common carriage**, **nondiscrimination**, and **end-to-end** architectures that prioritize user creativity over centralized control.

This insistence on infrastructural conditions signals a political anthropology. People are not isolated choosers but social learners formed through practices and institutions. The shape of **infrastructure** thus shapes the **soul**, a claim that edges toward theology of culture. It resonates with Augustinian concerns for *ordo amoris* and with Reformed accounts of **formative liturgies** that habituate desires. For Frischmann, as for a civic republican, freedom requires guardrails that prevent domination by platforms that manipulate attention and choice. That civic diagnosis opens onto explicitly moral language in his later work.

#### 6. Re-Engineering Humanity 2018 and techno-social engineering
In **Re-Engineering Humanity** 2018, coauthored with **Evan Selinger**, Frischmann diagnoses the rise of **techno-social engineering** that erodes **thick autonomy** and **human dignity**. The book critiques practices like **smart contracts**, **hypernudging**, **frictionless defaults**, and **platform paternalism** that outsource judgment to machines and monetize behavioral prediction. The authors warn against a social trajectory in which people become interoperable components in **platform infrastructures**, primed for compliance and stripped of meaningful deliberation. They defend a richer conception of **autonomy** that includes the capacities to reflect, resist, and narrate a life within communities and traditions.

Policy recommendations include **design ethics**, **legal constraints on manipulation**, **education for digital agency**, and institutional reforms that preserve **choice architectures** hospitable to personhood. The tone is urgent yet non-apocalyptic, calling for civic counter-formation rather than retreat. The book concretizes Frischmann's long-standing concern that infrastructures can be engineered to narrow rather than expand human possibilities. For the theologian, the argument invites translation into the language of **concupiscence**, **idolatry**, and **discipleship**, as well as into practices of sabbath, attention, and communal discernment within a technological *saeculum*.

#### 7. Normative posture and moral anthropology
Across these works, the normative posture is a blend of **value pluralism**, **capabilities-like flourishing**, and **civic republican non-domination**. **Frischmann** does not reduce the good to welfare metrics but treats goods like **autonomy**, **creativity**, and **participation** as irreducible. His anthropology presumes that humans are social, plastic, and formed by **institutions** and **technologies**. He is wary of both libertarian surrender to markets and technocratic planning that crowds out civil society. The preferred horizon is a **polycentric order** in which infrastructures are stewarded to serve diffuse, evolving human goods.

This posture can be cast in the idiom of **natural law** without dogmatic entailments. It assumes a creational intelligibility of social systems and a role for prudence in institutional design. It views the **commons** as more than the absence of property and less than a utopia, requiring rules, roles, and responsibility. The underlying eschatology is nonredemptive yet hopeful that human practical reason can chart better paths. For Christian theology, this raises questions of **common grace** and the **noetic effects of sin**, the plausibility of shared moral knowledge, and the limits of secular accounts of the **telos** of human making.

#### 8. Theological traction and constructive appropriation
The theological traction of **Frischmann's** oeuvre lies in its account of **infrastructure** as moral architecture. One may recast his **infrastructure commons** as creational gifts that mediate **providence** and enable obedience to the **cultural mandate**. The insistence on openness and generativity comports with an **imago Dei** anthropology in which human creativity reflects divine fecundity, ordered by *caritas* toward the neighbor. His critique of **enclosure**, **manipulation**, and **over-optimization** maps onto Calvinist warnings about **idolatry**, technocratic hubris, and the deformation of desire. His defense of **autonomy** as thick agency can be reframed as the cultivation of **ordered liberty** under **law** and **gospel** within covenanted communities.

Christian public theology can appropriate his **commons governance** framework to articulate policies for **communications**, **environment**, and **knowledge** that protect the weak and promote the *bonum commune*. **Kuyperian sphere sovereignty** offers a consonant template for polycentric stewardship, ensuring that state, market, and civil associations do not absorb one another. Moreover, practices of ecclesial catechesis, sabbath, and communal discernment can be read as counter-infrastructures that resist **techno-social engineering**. Frischmann does not supply the eschatological hope or the doxological telos, yet his analysis supplies prudential wisdom for pilgrim communities navigating a **platform society**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A **Reformed** and **Westminster** evaluation would commend **Brett M. Frischmann** for his lucid defense of **commons stewardship**, his critique of **market idolatry**, and his civic emphasis on **polycentric governance** that aligns with **sphere sovereignty** and **public justice**. His affirmation of **thick autonomy**, **dignity**, and **human flourishing** resonates with **imago Dei** and **ordered liberty**, and his account of **techno-social engineering** rightly exposes structures of **domination** that deform desire. Yet Westminster instincts would question the procedural neutrality and anthropocentric teleology that underwrite his framework. Without a confessed **Creator–creature distinction**, **covenantal** account of knowledge, and frank reckoning with the **antithesis** and **noetic effects of sin**, his optimism about empirical governance and common moral reason risks underestimating the depth of **idolatry** in technological orders. The Reformed alternative preserves his infrastructural insights but relocates them within **Christ's lordship** over creation, the **cultural mandate** tempered by cross-shaped service, and a normative plumb line in **lex Dei** for evaluating ends as well as means. Policy proposals should be explicitly teleological, aiming not only at generativity but at **neighbor-love** and **Sabbath-wise** limits that witness to eschatological rest. In short, receive his **commons** as a providential instrument of **common grace**, but insist that true **flourishing** requires conversion of ends, not only redesign of infrastructures.
