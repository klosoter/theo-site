### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Tom Greggs belongs to a cohort of contemporary British evangelicals who have pressed toward a more classical, ecumenical **systematic theology** while retaining Free Church instincts. As Marischal Chair of Divinity at the **University of Aberdeen**, his career has unfolded within a post-Christendom British academy haunted by both **secularization** and the resilient presence of diverse **religions**. Shaped by **Baptist** convictions and scholarly exposure to **Karl Barth** and **Dietrich Bonhoeffer**, Greggs locates his constructive work in a space that is both academically rigorous and ecclesially accountable. His method is a self-conscious **christocentric trinitarian dogmatics** that resists the temptation to treat Christianity as one **religion** among others. He frames theology as **faith seeking understanding** ordered to **mission**, where the canon of **Scripture** functions normatively within the worshipping community. Theologically he leans into a Barthian **analogia fidei** and away from an **analogia entis**, insisting that knowledge of God is given in the **revelation** of the **Word made flesh**, not by extrapolation from nature. This approach, forged in late modern pluralism, serves his larger thesis that theology must be against **religion** as self-justifying ideology, even while being for the **church** as the **people of God** sent in the **Spirit**.

Under the twin influences of **Barth** and **Bonhoeffer**, Greggs deploys a dialectic of **grace** over against **religion** that resonates with **Luther’s** *theologia crucis* and **Augustine’s** critique of **idolatry**. He argues that religions, including Christian forms, are often instruments of **self-justification** and boundary-making, whereas the **gospel** announces the **unconditioned gift** of God’s **reconciliation** in **Jesus Christ**. Thus, his method is at once **apophatic** about creaturely constructions of the divine and **cataphatic** about the **Christological** self-giving of God, seeking a posture of **epistemic humility** joined to a robust **confession** of the **Trinity**. This methodological stance bears fruit in his three major trajectories: the reconfiguration of **universal salvation** in Christ, the elaboration of a **missionary ecclesiology** he calls **priestly catholicity**, and the sustained critique of **religion** as a theological category.

#### 2. Barth, Origen, and the reconfiguration of universal salvation
Greggs’s early monograph **Barth, Origen, and Universal Salvation** (2009) set the course for his mature voice. He recovers **Origen’s apokatastasis** without importing Origen’s speculative cosmology, defending a robustly **christological universalism** that reads salvation’s universality through the **particularity** of **Jesus Christ**. Against crude pluralism and against a voluntarist predestinarianism, Greggs appeals to **Barth’s doctrine of election** where **Jesus Christ** is both **electing God** and **elected man**, suggesting that God’s **Yes** spoken in the concrete history of the crucified and risen Lord entails a divine determination toward the salvation of all. In this scheme, judgment is real and purgative, but it is encompassed within the larger **economy of reconciliation**, a pattern he discerns across **Romans 5**, **1 Corinthians 15**, and the Johannine vision of **life** in the **Son**.

His retrieval is careful to maintain **particularity** against charges of generic universalism. He resists the idea that **universal salvation** can be grounded in a natural metaphysic of the soul, as in some readings of **apokatastasis**, and instead insists it must be anchored in **Christ’s person and work**, including the Spirit’s application of redemption. Here Greggs draws from **patristic** resources like **Gregory of Nyssa** and from modern conversation partners like **Hans Urs von Balthasar**, while differentiating himself from proposals that imagine a purely speculative hope. For Greggs, the hope for the restoration of all is not a hedge against hell, but the dogmatic entailment of **God’s triunity** and **love**, a **theological necessity** under the reign of **grace**. He argues that the **missio Dei** does not become superfluous under universalism; rather, mission becomes the church’s participation in the **Spirit’s** bringing to light what God has already secured **in Christ** for the world. The eschatological horizon of **apokatastasis** thus functions for him as doxological confidence rather than pastoral complacency.

#### 3. Theology against religion and the church for the world
In **Theology against Religion: Constructive Dialogues with Bonhoeffer and Barth** (2011), Greggs radicalizes the Reformational critique of **religio** by aligning with **Bonhoeffer’s** call for a **religionless Christianity** and with **Barth’s** dismissal of **natural theology**. He contends that religion operationalizes **works-righteousness**, stabilizes social identity through **law** rather than **gospel**, and domesticates God into institutional forms of power. Faith, by contrast, is the **Spirit-given** participation in the **Son’s** filial relation to the **Father**, a **communion** that outpaces and judges all human religious striving. This theme recasts **sin** as **curvatus in se** not only morally but also religiously, such that the cure is not improved piety but the **justifying** act of God’s **grace**. The **church** therefore exists not to secure its religious privileges but to witness to the **kingdom**, in the world and for the world, as a community shaped by **Word** and **Spirit**.

This anti-religion dogmatics has direct implications for **theology of religions**. Greggs repudiates **relativist pluralism** that levels **Christ’s lordship**, yet he also refuses a simple **exclusivism** that cannot account for the **Spirit’s** universal agency. He articulates a **pneumatological generosity** that perceives graced dispositions, truth, and goodness outside the visible church without construing them as paths to salvation apart from **Christ**. In this he engages **John Hick** and **Karl Rahner** critically, adopting neither **pluralism** nor **anonymous Christianity**, but a **christocentric inclusivism** that is aggressively trinitarian. The net effect is to maintain the bold **scandal of particularity** while admitting the complexity of the religious field in late modernity. For Greggs, the right binary is not Christianity versus other religions, but **grace** versus **religion** across all human cultures, including the church’s own life.

#### 4. Dogmatic Ecclesiology and the priestly catholicity of the church
The constructive center of Greggs’s mature project is his unfolding multi-volume **Dogmatic Ecclesiology**, beginning with **Vol. 1: The Priestly Catholicity of the Church** (2019). He retrieves the Reformation’s **priesthood of all believers** and the patristic sense of the church’s **catholicity**, reuniting them as a single calling: the people of God are a **royal priesthood**, called to offer spiritual sacrifices of **praise**, intercede for the world, and bear the **gospel** to the nations. By recasting catholicity as a charism of breadth, unity, and mission, he pushes against sectarian **denominationalism** while refusing centralized **clericalism**. The church’s holiness and unity are gifts of the **Triune God**, not achievements of institutional management. This yields a **missionary ecclesiology** in which sacrament, discipline, and doctrine are ordered to the church’s **sending** rather than its self-maintenance.

Greggs’s ecclesiology draws ecumenically on **Lumen Gentium**, **Reformed** accounts of the marks of the church, **Baptist** covenantal practices, and **Eastern** emphases on **theosis**, while resisting any collapse of the church into the **Eucharist** or the **episcopate** as if these alone secured catholicity. He affirms the church’s **real participation** in Christ’s presence through **Word and Spirit**, extending a chastened **sacramental realism** that sits within a Free Church paradigm. The **visible-invisible** distinction is deployed critically, not as a dualism but as a confession that the church’s **form** and its **esse** are not coextensive. For Greggs, the **marks of the church** are discerned as the fruit of the **gospel’s** generative power, not as badges to be policed. Ecclesial authority is thus derivative, ministerial, and oriented to **mission**, while **discipline** is exercised for the sake of **reconciliation** and **witness** in the world.

#### 5. Scripture, doctrine, and the economy of grace
Running through Greggs’s corpus is a tight account of **Scripture** and **doctrine** as the church’s normative **testimony** to **revelation**. In line with **Barth**, he refuses to identify the **Bible** with **revelation** as such, but insists that in the economy of **the Word and Spirit** the biblical canon bears unique, sufficient authority for **dogmatics**. He resists a foundationalist epistemology and instead advances **ecclesial reasoning** that is both canonical and chastened. The use of **creedal** and **confessional** norms is positive and ecumenical, yet they are always secondary to **Scripture’s** witness to **Christ**. This yields a style of doctrinal reasoning that is doxological, catechetical, and missionary, with **systematic theology** serving preaching, teaching, and the formation of the **royal priesthood**.

The content of doctrine follows the grain of **grace**. **Election** is read through **Christology** rather than decrees considered *ad intra* in abstraction. **Atonement** is rendered in a many-sided way that includes **substitution**, **victory**, and **participation**, ordered to **reconciliation** rather than penalty alone. **Pneumatology** is expansive, giving the **Holy Spirit** prominent agency in sanctification, mission, and the manifestation of truth beyond ecclesial boundaries. The cumulative effect is a dogmatics of **divine generosity** where **grace** is not simply remedial but constitutive of the creature’s destiny, oriented toward **communion** with the **Triune God**.

#### 6. Public theology, the university, and interfaith life
Greggs’s work also advances a vision for **public theology** at the **university** and within plural societies. He argues that Christian theology can and must inhabit public reason precisely by refusing the pretensions of **religion** as ideology and by speaking the grammar of **grace** in ways that commend the **gospel** without coercion. This posture is underwritten by confidence in the **Spirit’s** universal presence and by a robust doctrine of **creation** affirmed in **Christ**. Theologically, he distances himself from **natural theology** as a foundation for public discourse, preferring *ad hoc* participation in common goods and a dialogical practice of **witness**. In interfaith settings, he commends humility that neither blunts the **scandal of particularity** nor denies the possibility that the **Spirit** can ready hearts for the **Word** wherever truth and love are found.

This public-facing dimension coheres with his **priestly catholicity**: the church serves the world in prayer, hospitality, and truth-telling. The university is a privileged theater for such service, where theology contributes to intellectual and moral formation by rendering the **truth of God** known in **Christ** as a living wisdom. Greggs’s insistence that theology belongs in the university because it belongs to the **church** protects both domains from collapse into **religion** as cultural identity. His account is thus at once confessional and dialogical, a rare combination in contemporary **evangelical** scholarship.

#### 7. Interlocutors and debates
Greggs’s most persistent conversation partners are **Barth** and **Bonhoeffer** on **revelation**, **grace**, and **religionlessness**, and **Origen** on **hope** for **universal salvation**. He debates **Hick** and **Rahner** over the scope of salvation and the meaning of other faiths, and he engages **Balthasar** on the legitimacy of **hopeful universalism** while pressing further toward a stronger dogmatic claim. Within **Baptist** and **evangelical** circles, he interacts with voices like **Stanley Grenz** and **James Wm. McClendon Jr.** on **Free Church ecclesiology**, while absorbing ecumenical insights from **Roman Catholic** ecclesiology and **Orthodox** accounts of **personhood** and **theosis**. He reads the **Fathers**, the **Reformers**, and modern dogmatics in service of a constructive program that is at once **catholic** and **evangelical**.

At points, Greggs’s proposals cross swords with classical **Reformed** dogmatics. His rejection of **natural theology** echoes **Barth** against Reformed scholastic uses of **general revelation**. His **universalism** strains against **particular redemption** and against a twofold eschatological outcome. His **pneumatological inclusivism** invites scrutiny from those wary of blurring the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief. Yet his christological clarity, dogmatic discipline, and missionary urgency keep him in real conversation with **Reformed** orthodoxy, even when the conversation is agonistic.

#### 8. Integrative judgment: strengths and tensions
The strength of Greggs’s corpus lies in its integrative force. **Christocentric universalism**, **anti-religion dogmatics**, and **priestly catholicity** are not separable programs but mutually informing dimensions of one account of the **gospel**. The **Triune God** of **grace** elects in **Christ** for communion, exposes **religion** as self-authorization, and gathers a **royal priesthood** for the life of the world. The tone is doxological rather than managerial, and the method is **ecclesial** rather than merely academic. For evangelicals fatigued by culture wars and thin doctrinal minimalism, his voice offers a thick **dogmatics** that is generous, mission-shaped, and genuinely **catholic** in scope. He demonstrates how a **Free Church** theologian can write churchly theology without surrendering Baptist convictions, and how a university theologian can write as a confessor without capitulating to **religion** as an ideology of identity.

The tensions are equally clear. His commitment to **universal salvation** risks short-circuiting the **New Testament**’s warnings regarding **judgment** and undercutting the urgency of **repentance** and **faith** as commanded responses to the **gospel**. His rejection of **natural theology** forecloses some classic **Reformed** accounts of **general revelation** and **common grace**. His ecclesiology commendably resists **clericalism** but may flatten sacramental ontology in ways that make **Word and sacrament** functionally instrumental rather than constitutive of the church’s **being**. These tensions, however, are engaged with intellectual honesty and a clear sense of the goods he hopes to secure: the primacy of **grace**, the centrality of **Christ**, and the **church’s** orientation to **mission** in the **Spirit**.

Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Greggs’s program invites both strong affirmation and serious dissent. Positively, his **anti-religion** critique converges with **Calvin’s** account of the heart as a **factory of idols**, his **christocentric** method with the **principium theologiae** in **revelation**, and his **missional ecclesiology** with the **priesthood of all believers** under the authority of **Scripture**. His rejection of **natural theology** will resonate with **Van Til’s** insistence on **revelation** as the principium and the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, even if Van Til acknowledges **general revelation** by God’s design. Yet two disputes remain decisive. First, Greggs’s **universal salvation** contradicts the **Westminster Standards** on **particular redemption**, **effectual calling**, and the **twofold outcome** of **judgment**, and it attenuates the covenantal seriousness of **law-gospel** and **means of grace** in history. Reformed dogmatics can honor the cosmic scope of **Colossians 1** while preserving the eschatological seriousness of **Hebrews 9** and **Revelation 20** by maintaining a principled distinction between the sufficiency of **Christ’s atonement** for all and its efficacy for the **elect**. Second, Greggs’s Free Church **sacramentology** risks instrumentalizing **Word and sacrament** as mere vehicles of mission rather than as divinely instituted **means of grace** constitutive of the church’s **visible** form under **Christ’s kingship**. A Reformed alternative would retain Greggs’s **priestly catholicity** while reintegrating robust **Lord’s Day** worship, **covenant** administration, **discipline**, and **shepherding** within the **keys of the kingdom**, preserving both **grace’s** objectivity and **mission’s** urgency. In sum, Reformed theology can receive Greggs’s clarion call to **Christocentrism**, **anti-idolatry**, and **mission**, while dissenting from his **universalism** and pressing for a thicker covenantal account of the church’s **means of grace** and the gravity of final **judgment**.
