### ESSAY
Brent Waters has emerged as a leading voice in contemporary Christian ethics by asking how discipleship should be lived amid the pressures of **biomedical innovation**, **digital technoculture**, and **economic globalization**. His formation is unmistakably Augustinian, filtered through **Reinhold Niebuhr’s realism** and **Paul Ramsey’s medical moral theology**, and refined in conversation with **Oliver O’Donovan’s** political theology. Waters teaches in a mainline Protestant context and writes for church and academy alike, but the gravamen of his project is an **eschatologically ordered practical reason** in which Christians learn to use the goods of the *saeculum* without turning them into idols. The structuring thesis that organizes his corpus is the discipline of **penultimate goods** drawn from **Dietrich Bonhoeffer**. The Christian receives and employs created goods as genuinely good, yet only as penultimate under the Lordship of the **Incarnate Christ**, whose resurrection and ascension set the final *telos* of human flourishing.

Waters’s method is deliberately modest and ecclesially oriented, though it speaks in **public reason**. He rejects both technological enthusiasm and romantic reaction. Drawing on **Augustine’s ordo amoris**, he construes ethics as rightly ordering loves to God and neighbor within the limits of **creaturely finitude**. He commends a chastened version of **natural law**, not as a freestanding metaphysics but as a grammar of prudence accountable to **Scripture** and to the practices of an actually existing church. The guiding pattern is **incarnation and finitude** rather than any technique of control. Waters frequently revisits **Bonhoeffer’s penultimate**, which names the middle range of Christian moral life, bounded above by eschatological promise and below by common necessities like eating, healing, marrying, trading, and governing. This method yields a posture of what he calls pilgrim use, a sanctified **use of technology** without capitulation to **technological imperialism**.

The early, programmatic book **From Human to Posthuman** in 2006 sets the trajectory. Waters engages the promises of **posthumanism** pressed by **Nick Bostrom** and **Ray Kurzweil** and exposes the theological pathologies that would dissolve the **imago Dei** into information patterns or neurochemical substrates. The desire to transcend **mortality**, vulnerability, and dependency, he argues, reprises **Augustine’s account of pride**, a refusal of creaturely limits. Waters mines **Hans Jonas’s imperative of responsibility** and **Albert Borgmann’s critique of the device paradigm**, not to demonize technology, but to locate it within a social ecology of practices that sustain persons and communities. The antidote to the posthuman temptation is not technological abstinence but **eschatological patience** that receives embodiment as gift and that resists translating salvation into indefinite **enhancement**. Theologically, Waters frames this as a struggle between the **two loves** of **Augustine’s two cities**, the love of God to the contempt of self and the love of self to the contempt of God, reenacted in the laboratory and the marketplace.

The argument deepens in **This Mortal Flesh: Incarnation and Bioethics** in 2009, where Waters places **Christology** at the center of medical ethics. Incarnation publicly confirms the goodness of created **flesh**, while crucifixion and resurrection relocate **mortality** within Christian hope. The upshot is a robust distinction between the kind of medicine that honors mortal creatures and the technics that seek to repudiate finitude. Waters treats end-of-life care, organ transplantation, reproductive technologies, and regenerative medicine with a Ramsey-like mix of compassion and caution. He is wary of the therapy versus enhancement distinction as a crisp principle, yet he retains it heuristically to interrogate proposals for radical life extension, elective eugenics, and germline editing such as **CRISPR**. The ruling criterion is neither an abstract autonomy nor an inflexible sanctity-of-life absolutism, but the **ordered love** that allows the mortal to die well, receives children as gifts rather than projects, and refuses the commodification of bodies and body parts. Waters thus articulates a **Christian bioethics of finitude** in which medicine is a penultimate work of mercy, not a rival soteriology.

Institutional life and household formation come to the fore in **The Family in Christian Social and Political Thought** in 2007. Waters reads **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, **Luther**, and **Calvin**, along with moderns like **Kant** and **Hegel**, to argue that the **household** is not a private enclave but a public good that mediates between persons and the state. The family is a school of **virtue**, a site of **procreative and educative goods**, and a buffer against both radical individualism and state absorption. Waters resists reducing the family to affective choice or market contract. He calls instead for **institutional pluralism** in which **mediating structures** bear real authority. This carries implications for law, welfare policy, and labor arrangements that either support or erode the shared work of childrearing and care for the elderly. Theologically, he insists that the **church’s catechesis** and liturgical time shape households for fidelity amid the flux of technoculture, reminding them that children are begotten not made, received not optimized.

The political and economic dimensions of his project are crystallized in **Just Capitalism: A Christian Ethic of Economic Globalization** in 2016. Waters refuses the pieties of both the unfettered market and the nostalgic retreat into localism. He retrieves **Catholic social teaching** on the **common good**, **solidarity**, and **subsidiarity**, yet transposes these into a Protestant key attuned to **vocation** and **Niebuhrian realism**. Markets are powerful instruments for generating wealth and alleviating poverty, yet they are not self-justifying. Waters proposes that capitalism becomes just when it is ordered to the flourishing of **households**, disciplined by the **rule of law** and **civil society**, and tethered to long-term goods such as **patient capital**, **sustainable production**, and dignified labor within global supply chains. He reads **Adam Smith** with sympathy for moral sentiments, engages **Amartya Sen** on capabilities, and critiques **Friedrich Hayek** where market price is treated as a final oracle. The normative question is not whether to globalize, but how to direct global networks toward **creational goods** and away from the consumptive formation of restless selves so characteristic of **technoculture**.

A synthetic statement arrives in **Christian Moral Theology in the Emerging Technoculture** in 2014, where Waters takes stock of the cultural metamorphosis wrought by **digital mediation**, rapid iteration, and constant connectivity. He argues that technoculture habituates impatience, disembodiment, and instrumental relations, each of which corrodes **ecclesial practices** of presence, promise, and praise. The Christian counter-formation is not primarily argumentative but liturgical and communal. Bodies must be retrained through **Sabbath-like rhythms**, **Eucharistic gratitude**, and neighborly **hospitality** that interrupt the acceleration of life. Here Waters’s **Augustinian eschatology** is most pronounced. The church is a community that leans into the promised future, yet lives now by cultivating **penultimate goods** with restraint and responsibility. He warns that the church’s own adoption of marketing metrics and platform logics can hollow out witness. In that sense, technoculture is not merely a topic of bioethics but a regime of desire to which the **ordo amoris** must be again aligned.

Throughout his corpus Waters models a style of argument that bridges **virtue ethics** and **political theology**. He integrates **rules**, **ends**, and **character**, resisting the truisms of method wars. He draws heavily on **Augustine** to discipline the modern will, on **O’Donovan** to retrieve authority as gift for common life, and on **Ramsey** to defend vulnerable patients against the quiet coercions of progress. His polemical sparring partners are instructive. Against **Hauerwas**, he insists that the church must engage public reason without dissolving into the nation-state, a stance of **realist engagement** without Constantinian triumphalism. Against **posthumanists** like **Bostrom** and **Kurzweil**, he contends that salvation is in Christ, not in algorithms, and that the **incarnation and finitude** are features, not bugs, of creaturely existence. Against both libertarian economics and technocratic planning, he elevates **mediating institutions** and household formation as the primary soil of moral agency.

Waters’s ethical judgments are often concrete and pastorally attentive. In end-of-life care, he defends the withdrawal of burdensome treatment while condemning intentionally hastened death, a **Paul Ramsey** line that respects the difference between allowing to die and killing. In reproductive ethics, he cautions against assisted reproductive technologies that alienate the **unitive and procreative goods** and that commercialize gestation, while recognizing the moral weight of parental longing. In enhancement debates, he interrogates the appeal to autonomy by asking how communities are reshaped by normalization pressures and competitive dynamics. In economic life, he urges Christians to invest, hire, buy, and innovate in ways that stabilize **households** and neighborhoods rather than extract short-term gains. In political life, he champions **institutional pluralism** that defends schools, charities, and civic bodies against capture by state or market. Each of these judgments exemplifies his basic axiom: the **penultimate goods** of creaturely life are to be used with thanksgiving, restraint, and hope, because they are neither ultimate nor dispensable.

The theological engine driving this stance is Christological. Waters’s repeated appeal to **incarnation and finitude** corrects technocratic denial of limits and grounds a sacramental realism about bodies. Yet he does not romanticize suffering or mortality. Because the **resurrection** relativizes death’s dominion, Christians are free to accept death when it is time to die and to pursue healing when it serves the neighbor’s good. This already and not yet grammar steadies the hand when new devices promise mastery. It also underwrites Waters’s insistence that the **church** is not an enclave but a public body whose worship orders desires and whose catechesis equips saints to discern how to live in the *saeculum*. The result is a moral theology at once critical and constructive, welcoming of technology as a subordinate art while refusing its colonization of the human.

Reformed and Westminster readers will find much to commend and to contest in Waters’s project. His affirmation of **creation-fall-redemption**, his **Augustinian realism** about sin, and his defense of **mediating institutions** resonate with **two-kingdoms prudence** and **sphere sovereignty** instincts. His critique of **technological idolatry**, his stress on **creaturely limits**, and his preference for **household-centered economics** align with classical Protestant concerns for vocation and the sanctification of ordinary life. Yet tensions remain. Waters leans on a chastened **natural law** and **public reason** strategy that may, from a Westminster vantage, understate the antithesis between covenant obedience and unbelief and the primacy of **special revelation** for public ethics. His Christological center of **incarnation and finitude** sometimes eclipses **atonement** and **union with Christ** as the moral source and shape of Christian life. His account of **just capitalism** prizes solidarity and subsidiarity, but Reformed critics may press for a sharper doctrine of **total depravity** in market dynamics and a thicker account of **covenant justice** that disciplines property and contract. A Westminster alternative would retain Waters’s **penultimate goods** while more explicitly subordinating public moral discourse to **Scripture’s sufficiency**, integrating ethics into the **covenant of grace**, and deploying **Sabbath**, **Lord’s Day worship**, and **diaconal polity** as the institutional counter-formation to technoculture’s liturgies. Even so, Waters’s achievement stands: he clarifies how Christians may inhabit late modernity without surrendering to it, by ordering penultimate goods to the supreme good of God in Christ.
