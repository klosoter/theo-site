### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the problem she names
Shoshana **Zuboff** emerges as a leading theorist of **surveillance capitalism** from within the institutional setting of **Harvard Business School**, positioned at the hinge between late industrial management science and the rise of **digital platforms**. Born in 1951 and trained in organizational psychology, she entered academic prominence as the personal computer, networked databases, and enterprise software redefined the labor process and corporate governance, a convergence she framed with the early concept of **informating**. Her historical setting is the post-Cold War consolidation of **neoliberal globalization**, where markets are imagined as self-correcting and personal data as a frictionless resource. The intellectual atmosphere is saturated with **Foucault’s** analyses of power, **Arendt’s** defense of public freedom, **Polanyi’s** warning about fictitious commodities, and **Weber’s** story of rationalization. Against that background her signature claim is stark: a novel regime of accumulation has learned to extract, transform, and monetize human experience, culminating in what she names **instrumentarian power** and the rise of the **Big Other**.

#### 2. Method, epistemic stance, and moral horizon
Methodologically **Zuboff** practices an interpretive **political economy** that joins thick description of corporate innovations to a defense of **human autonomy** as both a moral and epistemic good. Her stance is deliberately **humanist**, grounded in a language of rights and the dignity of persons, and is alert to institutional design and the sociology of organizations. The method relies on case studies of **Google**, **Facebook**, and device ecosystems, and on rhetorical analysis of corporate discourse, which she reads as a confession of power. The epistemic core is the conviction that the capacity to peacefully inhabit opacity to others, to form a self that is not incessantly computed, is prerequisite to knowledge and responsibility. She therefore treats **epistemic inequality** as a new structure of domination, where firms hoard the means of learning and prediction. Her frame foregrounds the distinction between the older **industrial capitalism** organized around commodities and labor, and the newer **surveillance capitalism** organized around data extraction and behavioral prediction.

#### 3. Early work: informating and the managerial gaze
In **In the Age of the Smart Machine** published in 1988, **Zuboff** analyzes the transformation of work under computerization by distinguishing automation from what she calls **informating**, that is, the production of information about every process and person as a byproduct of digital systems. This dual process both augments and disciplines the worker, empowering new forms of knowledge while intensifying the managerial gaze. The result is a reconfiguration of authority and consent in the firm, where knowledge flows can flatten hierarchies yet also enable continuous **surveillance** and metrics-based control. Already present are themes that will mature later, such as the conversion of life into machine-readable signals and the tension between emancipation and capture. Her descriptive acuity about dashboards, logs, and performance traces provides the technical substratum for her later diagnosis of **instrumentarian power** and **behavioral surplus**.

#### 4. From managerial capitalism to the extraction imperative
With **The Support Economy** in 2002 coauthored with **James Maxmin**, **Zuboff** criticizes an exhausted managerial capitalism that fails the individual in her need for support, proposing distributed architectures aligned with the person rather than mass standardization. This constructive program is eclipsed in her later account by the empirical discovery that dominant firms have instead perfected an **extraction imperative**. In **The Age of Surveillance Capitalism** published in 2019 she narrates how **Google** pioneered the appropriation of what she calls **behavioral surplus**, the residue of data collected beyond what is necessary to improve a service, then transformed those data into predictive products marketed in **behavioral futures markets**. The system scales by expansion, integration, and prediction. Expansion widens the frontier of capture into home, street, and body through phones, assistants, and sensors. Integration binds disparate streams under unified identities through cross-device tracking and cloud services. Prediction converges on automated machine learning that produces scores for ad auctions and logistics. The logic is an economic **oikonomia** that converts lived experience into a raw material for a new commodity form, subject to the imperatives of revenue growth and investor expectations.

#### 5. Instrumentarian power, Big Other, and the reconfiguration of sovereignty
To conceptualize this regime **Zuboff** coins **instrumentarian power**, a form of behavioral modification that differs from sovereign coercion and from the terror of totalitarianism. Drawing with critical distance on **B. F. Skinner’s** behaviorism, she argues that surveillance capitalists seek not the soul or the conscience but the reliable tuning of behavior through cues, rewards, and architectures of choice. This power is non-confrontational and non-ideological, yet it is comprehensive because it saturates the environments within which choices are made. She contrasts **Foucault’s panopticism**, which depends on the internalization of a disciplinary gaze, with the advent of the **Big Other**, a term meant to name the diffuse, ubiquitous computational apparatus that observes, compares, and nudges without any central observer. In this world the person is rendered machine-readable as a bundle of predicted propensities. The classical liberal image of the self-possessed individual is replaced by a computed subject, and the locus of sovereignty migrates toward platforms that command the **division of learning** and the terms of visibility and invisibility. The outcome is a civilizational shift in which the normal conditions of **human freedom** are quietly reversed.

#### 6. Legal imagination and the chartering of epistemic rights
The normative center of **Zuboff’s** project is a defense of **epistemic rights** that protect the sanctuaries of the self. She calls for a legal and political architecture that prohibits extraction not tied to service improvement, bans the trafficking of predictive products in **behavioral futures markets**, and restores **rule of law** over private regimes of monitoring. She reads **GDPR** in Europe as a partial step, insufficient because it allows consent to be engineered and because it focuses on privacy rather than on the upstream structures of data appropriation. Her remedy is a charter of rights to **decision spaces** free from manipulation and to knowledge about who learns what from whom. This legal imagination is joined to democratic oversight of **platform infrastructures**, structural separations between data custody and data analysis, and new forms of oversight that make algorithmic systems auditable. She frames these proposals as the only adequate response to an economic order that has successfully enacted a **contract of dispossession** in which citizens exchange lived experience for convenience without understanding the terms.

#### 7. Interlocutors, genealogy, and critical debate
The intellectual genealogy of **Zuboff’s** analysis draws deeply from **Hannah Arendt’s** defense of public action and the critique of loneliness that feeds domination, from **Karl Polanyi’s** warning that labor, land, and money become fictitious commodities when disembedded from social meaning, and from **Max Weber’s** account of rationalization and the iron cage. She situates herself against the reduction of meaning to stimulus response in **Skinner**, while borrowing the vocabulary of effect without embracing behaviorist anthropology. Readers have triangulated her work with **Foucault’s** discipline and **Deleuze’s** control societies, though she insists that instruments now act without the theatricality of the panopticon. Critics such as **Nick Srnicek** argue that platform power is continuous with capital’s general logic rather than an epochal rupture, while **Evgeny Morozov** presses her to dwell more on political economy than on moral vocabulary. Others influenced by the **Frankfurt School** detect continuities between culture industry and algorithmic nudging, yet they generally grant her the clarity of naming **Big Other** as a fresh configuration. Her response is to insist that **surveillance capitalism** is historically specific and not identical with capitalism as such, and that the novelty of **instrumentarian power** warrants new law.

#### 8. Anthropology, knowledge, and the moral texture of the critique
At the heart of **Zuboff’s** argument is an anthropology that prizes **autonomy**, **dignity**, and the possibility of initiating action in the world. She defends privacy not as secrecy but as the condition for moral agency, a space in which the self can form intentions and consent without coercive scripting. Knowledge is public and relational, yet the power to learn must not be monopolized by private entities that simplify persons into predictable populations. Her categories draw on a moral grammar in which the person is an end rather than a means, echoing a Kantian emphasis on respect and a civic republican concern for non-domination. The diagnosis is sharpened by attention to how design shapes practice, so that defaults and prompts act as a soft **nomos** that governs desire and behavior. Her positive vision is a digital order in which service is bound to fiduciary loyalty, in which the *telos* of computing is enablement rather than extraction, and in which technological innovation is judged by its contribution to human flourishing. Theologically adjacent resonances include the sanctity of **personhood**, the goods of **truth** and **freedom**, and the refusal to treat human life as mere material for optimization.

#### 9. Limits, tensions, and the scale of transformation
Even sympathetic readers mark tensions within **Zuboff’s** sweeping account. Her bright line between **industrial capitalism** and **surveillance capitalism** can blur where data-driven optimization becomes integral to manufacturing and logistics. Her rhetorical contrasts between **instrumentarian power** and classical **sovereignty** risk underplaying how states and firms interlock in security assemblages. Some point out that the binary between manipulative extraction and legitimate service improvement is not always discretely operationalizable in code and contracts. Others ask whether a charter of **epistemic rights** and regulatory bans can withstand the financial incentive structures of venture capital and advertising. Yet these criticisms rarely dislodge the core claim that the **extraction imperative** and **behavioral futures markets** tempt institutions to view persons as raw material. Her most durable contribution is the conceptual toolkit that names these enticements and the moral horizon that judges them, a language of **dignity**, **autonomy**, and **responsibility** that forces public reason to see what had been normalized as convenience.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: revelation, covenant, and ordered freedom
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, **Zuboff’s** analysis supplies acute phenomenology of power yet finally rests on an immanent moralism that needs a thicker doctrine of **revelation**, **covenant**, and **nature and grace**. Her defense of **autonomy** aligns in part with the **imago Dei**, since persons as image bearers are called to responsible freedom before God, yet her account presumes the self-sufficiency of liberal agency rather than life **coram Deo**. The antistructure she names as **instrumentarian power** is best interpreted within an Augustinian diagnosis of **idolatry**, where the quantifying **Big Other** rivals divine omniscience and invites *homo incurvatus in se*, meaning curved in on self, under the liturgy of personalization and convenience. The doctrine of **antithesis** clarifies why no amount of technical transparency can secure neutrality, since data extraction is not a mere tool but a directional love that either serves neighbor by **stewardship** or serves Mammon by domination. **Common grace** grants that her legal imagination of **epistemic rights** can secure provisional justice, yet **special revelation** discloses the deeper telos of knowledge as participation in truth under the **law of love** rather than mastery. In institutional terms **sphere sovereignty** and federal **covenant** argue against the consolidation of learning within unitary platforms, pressing for differentiated authorities in family, church, school, market, and state, with fiduciary constraints that mirror covenant loyalty. The Reformed alternative thus reframes her privatized sanctuaries of the self as sanctified vocations ordered to God and neighbor, commends bans on **behavioral futures markets** as acts of neighbor love rather than merely as rights claims, and tempers confidence in regulatory technique with repentance and renewal by grace. Her warning about **surveillance capitalism** stands as a providential summons to church and society to unmask technological **idolatry**, to recover sabbath limits, and to pursue digital architectures marked by truthfulness, **subsidiarity**, and covenantal accountability.
