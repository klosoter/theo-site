### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context
Jerome **Zanchi** 1516 to 1590, born Girolamo Zanchi in Bergamo, was forged at the crossroads of **Italian humanism**, **Augustinian monasticism**, and the turbulent politics of **Reformation exile**. Trained as an Augustinian canon regular and converted to the evangelical cause under **Peter Martyr Vermigli**, he absorbed a blend of **philological exactitude** and **scholastic discipline** that marked the Italianate wing of the **Reformed** movement. Fleeing the Inquisition, Zanchi entered the transalpine network of learned refugees, teaching at **Strasbourg** from 1553 to 1563 in a city contested by **Lutheran** and **Reformed** parties. There he encountered the sharp edge of confessionalization, disputing **Johannes Marbach** on **predestination** and the **Lord's Supper**, conflicts that pushed him toward clearer articulations of **Reformed orthodoxy**. Later called to **Heidelberg** in 1568 by Elector **Frederick III**, Zanchi joined the consolidation of a **Calvinist** university culture that fused **humanist sources** with **Aristotelian method** in service of Scripture. His final years in **Neustadt** and Heidelberg completed a career defined by exile, teaching, and polemic for the emerging **Reformed scholastic** tradition.

Zanchi’s intellectual habitat married **ancient sources** and **Renaissance method** to a self-conscious **confessional** project. He read **Aristotle** through Latin scholastic filters and embraced **Thomas Aquinas** as a technical ally in metaphysics while maintaining **Augustine** as the master of grace, will, and Church. In this, Zanchi anticipated the posture of later **Reformed orthodoxy** that deployed **scholastic tools** without surrendering to medieval authority. Theologically, he moved in conversation with **Calvin** and **Beza**, sharing a commitment to **Scripture’s sufficiency** and to the *regula fidei* as the grammar of system. His continental journey exposed him to **Lutheran infections** and sharpened his defense of **Reformed sacramentology**, while his Italian roots kept him alert to **anti-Trinitarian** currents flowing from **Laelius Socinus** and others. These encounters drove him toward a dogmatics that is unapologetically **classical** in metaphysics and distinctly **Reformed** in soteriology and covenant.

#### 2. Method and principia
The architecture of Zanchi’s theology rests on the paired principia of **Scripture** and **God** as principium cognoscendi and principium essendi. He insisted on the formal sufficiency of **Holy Scripture** and the material sufficiency of its **covenantal** witness, yet he ordered doctrinal exposition by **loci communes** in the Aristotelian manner. The result is an exegetically sourced and logically staged body of **disputationes** in which each locus begins with **biblical testimony**, is clarified by **philology** and **patristic** consensus, and is finally sharpened by **scholastic distinctions**. He deployed the **analogia fidei** to read Scripture with Scripture, but the scholastic scaffolding gave his treatments of **divine attributes**, **providence**, and **predestination** their crisp conceptual profile.

Zanchi’s appropriation of **Aristotelian causality** and **Thomistic actus purus** underscores his conviction that **Reformed** dogmatics needs a stable **metaphysical** grammar. His account of **simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** derives from a metaphysics of **pure actuality** that excludes all composition in God. Yet this metaphysics is not speculative autonomy. It is a servant of Scripture’s *Deus loquens*, providing the negative conditions by which **anthropomorphism** is curbed and divine **attributes** are harmonized. His method thus combines **kataphatic** narrative from the canon with **apophatic** guardrails drawn from classical theism, together enabling a robust **doctrina Dei**.

#### 3. Key works and literary profile
Several works anchor Zanchi’s legacy and show the breadth of his **scholastic** reform. First, **De religione Christiana fides** 1562 stands as a comprehensive **confession** addressed to the controversies of Strasbourg. It is a systematic tour that articulates **Trinity**, **Christology**, **justification**, **sacraments**, and **church** against **Lutheran** and **Anabaptist** dissent while affirming the common **ecumenical creeds**. Second, **De tribus Elohim** 1572 represents his most focused engagement with **Trinitarian** doctrine, treating the Hebrew title Elohim and its bearing on **personal distinctions** and **unity of essence**. Third, **De natura Dei** 1577 is a monumental account of the **divine attributes**, a sustained exposition of **simplicity**, **eternity**, **immutability**, **knowledge**, **will**, and **power**, often drawing on **Thomas** and **Augustine** while policing the bounds of **Reformed** conviction. Fourth, **De operibus Dei** 1580 to 1582 gathers his mature reflections on **creation**, **providence**, and **concurrence**, aiming to show how the God of **actus purus** genuinely acts in a world of **secondary causes**. Finally, **De peccato originali** c. 1570 concentrates his Augustinian anthropology into a doctrine of **original sin**, **bondage of the will**, and **imputation**, anticipating later Reformed **federal** constructions.

These works are characterized by Zanchi’s habit of beginning with **Scripture**, canvassing **fathers** and **schoolmen**, registering opponent claims from **Lutherans** or **anti-Trinitarians**, and then concluding with carefully qualified **determinatio**. His style is terse, repetitive in its distinctions, and alert to the pragmatic needs of **catechesis** in Reformed churches. The cumulative effect is an early blueprint for the genre of **Reformed scholastic** manuals later exemplified by **Polanus** and **Turretin**.

#### 4. Doctrine of God and Trinity
At the heart of Zanchi’s system is a full-blooded **doctrina Dei**. He contends for **divine simplicity** simplicitas Dei, asserting that God is without composition of act and potency, essence and existence, form and matter, universal and particular. This robust **simplicity** secures **immutability** and **impassibility**, while his defense of **aseity** grounds the Creator’s absolute **self-sufficiency**. For Zanchi, the biblical names of God are analogical disclosures of this **simple** reality, and the anthropomorphic predicates must be read through the **analogia fidei** to avoid collapsing God into the creaturely order.

In **Trinitarian** theology, Zanchi follows the **Nicene** and **Augustinian** lines, confessing one essence in three hypostases distinguished by **relations of origin**. **De tribus Elohim** ranges over linguistic and exegetical detail to rebut **Arian** and **Socinian** reductions, arguing that the plural Elohim, read canonically, accords with a triune revelation that culminates in the missions of **Word** and **Spirit**. He aligns with **Calvin’s autotheos** in confessing the **Son’s** true deity while affirming eternal generation. He is explicit about the *opera Trinitatis ad extra* being indivisa, and he uses **inseparable operations** to connect **Trinity** to **creation** and **providence**. His appropriation of classical **processions**, coupled with insistence on **Scripture’s sufficiency**, indicates a model of **Reformed catholicity**: ancient in grammar, evangelical in authority.

#### 5. Creation, providence, and concursus
Zanchi’s **De operibus Dei** expounds a meticulous doctrine of **creation** and **providence** in which **concursus Dei** receives central treatment. He argues that God is the universal first cause who, by a simultaneous **concurrence**, gives being, motion, and efficacy to all **secondary causes**, sustaining their natures without absorbing or overwhelming them. Against **Occasionalism**, he affirms real created causality; against **Pelagian** self-determination, he insists on the primacy of **divine causality**. He borrows from **Thomistic** accounts of causation while rejecting any implication that **God** is the author of sin. The metaphysical principle is clear: God as **actus purus** acts in and through second causes according to their kinds, so that freedom is preserved as **libertas a coactione**, freedom from external compulsion, not as autonomy from the first cause.

This yields a nuanced treatment of **providence** that integrates general governance and special direction. Zanchi distinguishes between God’s **efficacious will** and **permissive will**, carefully defining permission as a positive decree to allow and govern creaturely acts that God does not morally approve. On the problem of evil, he follows **Augustine** in seeing evil as privation that is incident to mutable wills, set within the higher order of divine **wisdom** that orders all to the good. In the realm of human action, **concursus** prevents both fatalism and Pelagianism, allowing Zanchi to safeguard **responsibility** while exalting divine **sovereignty**.

#### 6. Predestination and the will
Zanchi’s doctrine of **predestination** is resolutely **Augustinian** and **Reformed**. He affirms **unconditional election** and **reprobation** to manifest God’s **mercy** and **justice**, rejecting any foreseen merit as the ground of divine choice. While avoiding needless speculation, he shows sympathy for what later terminology would call **supralapsarian** reasoning by locating the decree of election and reprobation within the broader order of God’s end and means. Yet in exposition he often proceeds **infralapsarianly**, treating **creation**, **fall**, and **redemption** as the ordered means by which the decree is executed in time. He thus holds intention and execution in careful tandem, aiming to respect both the **divine simplicity** of decree and the **historical economy** of salvation.

On the human will, Zanchi teaches a classic fourfold state in **innocence**, **fallenness**, **grace**, and **glory**, expounding **servum arbitrium** in the fallen state while preserving civil and natural capacities. He defines freedom as **liberty of spontaneity** and **contingency** compatible with **divine providence**, repudiating **Stoic necessity** while banishing Pelagian autonomy. In **justification**, he is firmly **forensic**, resting **imputation** on **union with Christ**, and he insists on the instrumental role of **faith** as *fides iustificans* that receives Christ without contributing merit. The moral life is framed by **gratitude**, undergirded by **sanctification** and the rule of **God’s law**.

#### 7. Covenant, law, and sacraments
Although not the architect of the mature federal schema, Zanchi is an early exponent of **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae**, using the covenant structure to unify **creation**, **law**, and **gospel**. He posits a prelapsarian **covenant of works** in which Adam, created upright and endowed with the law, was promised life upon perfect obedience. After the fall, he discerns the **covenant of grace** unfolding through **Abraham**, **Moses**, and **Christ**, with a real continuity in **substance** and diversity in **administration**. This enables him to integrate **imputation** of Adam’s sin and of Christ’s righteousness within a juridical and federal frame, anticipating later **Westminster** expositions.

In **sacramentology**, Zanchi stands with the **Reformed** against **Lutheran ubiquitarianism** and **Roman transubstantiation**. He argues for **spiritual real presence**, where Christ’s true body and blood are received by **faith** through the **Holy Spirit**, without any local inclusion in the elements. His dispute with **Johannes Marbach** sharpened his insistence on the **ascension** and the **extra Calvinisticum**, that the finite is not capable of the infinite as an ontological principle. Baptism and the Supper are ordinances of the **covenant of grace**, confirming the promise to believers and their children, while always requiring **faith** for their fruitful reception.

#### 8. Ecclesiology, polemic, and pastoral aim
Zanchi’s ecclesiology remains **catholic and Reformed**. He confesses the visibility of the Church under the marks of **pure preaching**, **right administration of sacraments**, and **discipline**, while honoring the **creeds** and **councils** as subordinate norms. His **De religione Christiana fides** was not only a speculative treatise but also a pastoral apologetic aimed at clarifying **Reformed** identity within mixed-confession cities. The same pastoral concern colors his polemics against **Anabaptism** on civil authority and oath-taking, and against **Socinian** Christology by defending **homoousios** and **two natures** united in the one person of the **Son**. He sought to arm pastors and magistrates with a credible **Reformed catholicity** that could navigate both doctrinal precision and civic peace.

His literary voice is that of a teacher of ministers. Disputations on **providence**, **predestination**, and **original sin** are never far from **exhortation** to humility and worship. The doctrine of **God** is doxological. The doctrine of **grace** is consolatory. And the doctrine of **covenant** is ecclesially formative. In all of this, the early **Reformed scholastic** profile is clear: Scripture ordered by **loci**, doctrine expressed in **disputation**, and piety nourished by **catechesis**.

#### 9. Reception and influence
Zanchi’s influence radiated through **Heidelberg** into the broader **Reformed** world. His arguments for **simplicity**, **concursus**, and **predestination** are harvested by later systematizers like **Amandus Polanus** and **Francis Turretin**, who cite him as a reliable classical source. In England and the Netherlands, his **Confession** was translated and mined by **Puritan** and **Nadere Reformatie** divines for its **Trinitarian** and **sacramental** clarity. His articulation of **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae** contributed to the conceptual field that would flower in **Cocceius** and be codified in the **Westminster Standards**. While overshadowed in fame by **Calvin** and **Beza**, Zanchi supplied a bridge between **Renaissance humanism** and **confessional scholasticism**, showing that a **Reformed** dogmatics can inhabit **classical metaphysics** without losing evangelical nerve.

His reputation also owes to his role in cross-confessional dialogue. In the wake of the **Formula of Concord**, Zanchi’s Strasbourg controversies became case studies in **Lutheran-Reformed** difference over **ubiquity** and **predestination**. His anti-**Socinian** writings positioned him as an early sentinel against rationalist reductions of **Trinity** and **atonement**. And his careful use of **Thomas** encouraged a more confident **Reformed** retrieval of medieval insight, a legacy later consolidated by **post-Reformation scholastics**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and Westminster-oriented vantage, Zanchi is a touchstone of **classical theism** harnessed to **covenant gospel**. His **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** give metaphysical ballast to confessional statements like the **Westminster Confession** on God and the decrees. His **concursus Dei** protects **secondary causes** and human responsibility while refusing any compromise of **sovereignty**. His double account of **predestination** preserves both the unity of the decree and the **history of redemption**. And his early articulation of **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae** gives conceptual traction to the law-gospel dialectic crucial for **justification** and **assurance**. Yet tensions remain. Zanchi’s strong **Thomistic** appropriation risks allowing **actus purus** to dominate the grammar of **revelation**, potentially muting biblical **historicity** and **covenantal** idiom if not constantly tethered to redemptive history. His tendency to classify permission and efficacy within an all-encompassing **decretal** frame can invite worries about theodicy and pastoral assurance if abstracted from **Christology** and **means of grace**. A constructive alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** is not a rejection but a recalibration: maintain Zanchi’s **simplicity** and **concursus**, but prioritize the **covenantal** unfolding of God’s self-communication in **Word and sacrament**, let **union with Christ** govern the ordo of **justification** and **sanctification**, and allow the **covenant of grace** to function as the trinitarianly grounded medium of God’s immutable purpose in history. In that balance, Zanchi’s scholastic architecture serves, rather than steers, the evangelical script.
