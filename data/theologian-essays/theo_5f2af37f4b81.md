### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and turn to continuationism
Jack Deere emerged from the world of late twentieth-century **American evangelicalism**, trained within the dispensational and cessationist orbit of **Dallas Theological Seminary**. Educated in Old Testament exegesis and teaching at Dallas in the late 1970s and 1980s, Deere initially inhabited a theology marked by **B. B. Warfield's Counterfeit Miracles** and a conservative reading of **Hebrews 2** that tethered signs and wonders to the authentication of apostles. The wider ecclesial context was fractured by the **Pentecostal** and **Charismatic renewals**, with a third stream identified in the 1980s as the **Third Wave** by **C. Peter Wagner**, in which **John Wimber** emphasized the ministry of the Spirit in evangelism and discipleship. Deere's shift from cessationism to **continuationism** around the mid-1980s placed him at the contested edge of evangelical respectability, a move he narrates in **Surprised by the Power of the Spirit** 1993 as both exegetical conversion and experiential awakening. His departure from Dallas in 1987 and subsequent ministry alongside **Wimber** in Vineyard networks located his theology at the nexus of academic biblical studies and **charismatic praxis**.

This formation produced a distinctive epistemic posture that held together **sola Scriptura** and the expectant practice of **charismata**. Deere learned classical exegesis in the Dallas tradition, but he came to judge that his cessationism had been sustained by a hermeneutic of retrenchment, not by the **canonical logic** of **Acts** and **1 Corinthians 12-14**. The historian in him reexamined **patristic testimony** from figures like **Augustine** in City of God 22, the missionary record of global Christianity, and the role of the Spirit in the church's ordinary life. The apologist in him leaned into empirical case studies, healings, and verified prophetic words, arguing that **kingdom theology** in the line of **George Eldon Ladd** makes theological room for both inaugurated power and eschatological restraint.

#### 2. Method and epistemic claims
Deere's method is a combined program of **exegetical retrieval**, **pastoral phenomenology**, and **prudential testing**. He reads **1 Corinthians 13** as eschatological promise rather than canonical terminus, and **Ephesians 4** as a charter for ongoing equipping gifts until the church reaches the fullness of Christ. He challenges the claim that the so-called **sign gifts** served exclusively as apostolic credentials, pointing to the distribution of **prophecy**, **healings**, and **tongues** among non-apostolic believers in **Acts** and **Corinth**. He revises the definitional field of prophecy, adopting a **fallible congregational prophecy** model similar to **Wayne Grudem**, in which non-canonical, non-inerrant impressions may convey divine guidance that must be tested by Scripture and the gathered body.

Epistemically, Deere maintains a strong commitment to the **sufficiency and finality of Scripture** while denying that sufficiency excludes all forms of **non-canonical revelation**. He distinguishes between the closed deposit of **special revelation** that grounds doctrine and the continuing **charismata** that guide practice, edify congregations, and empower mission. This yields a layered authority structure: the Bible as the norma normans and **prophetic speech** as a prudential, church-tested aid. He trades on the practical wisdom of **discernment** in **1 Thessalonians 5**, instructing that prophecies should be weighed, not despised, and never used to trump the authority of the **canon**.

#### 3. Surprised by the Power of the Spirit 1993
In **Surprised by the Power of the Spirit** 1993, Deere offers his sustained case against **cessationism**. He undertakes biblical theology, reading **Luke-Acts** as a narrative where the Spirit empowers ordinary disciples for witness and mercy, and **Paul** as presupposing charismatic normalcy in **1 Corinthians**. He argues that **1 Corinthians 13.8-12** situates the cessation of partial knowledge at the beatific **telos** when we see face to face, not at the close of the apostolic era or the formation of the **New Testament canon**. He engages the theological history of the church, contending with **B. B. Warfield** by retrieving **Augustine's** mature testimony to miracles and healing in City of God, and by marshaling missionary reports and documented cases of healing as part of the Spirit's **ad extra** economy.

A critical move is his rejection of the apostolic authentication restriction, which he views as an inference not warranted by Scripture's depiction of charismatic life. **Ephesians 2.20** grounds the church in the foundation of apostles and prophets in the canonical sense, but Deere insists that **Ephesians 4** and **Romans 12** depict continuing gifts for edification. Against **John MacArthur's** **Charismatic Chaos** 1992, Deere claims that abuses do not invalidate biblical norms and that pastoral governance can restrain excess while preserving earnest desire for the **charismata**. The work also extends to **healing**, where Deere narrates cases and supplies a restrained theology of petition, insisting that faith is confidence in God, not in an outcome, and that healing belongs to the **kingdom's already and not yet**.

#### 4. Surprised by the Voice of God 1996
**Surprised by the Voice of God** 1996 applies Deere's continuationism to the domain of **prophecy** and guidance. He defines New Testament prophecy as a genuinely **revelatory** but **non-canonical** communication that may be a mixture of divine prompting and human interpretation. He argues from **Acts 21** and the case of **Agabus** that prophetic content may be substantially correct while containing interpretive imprecision, thus distinguishing **fallible congregational prophecy** from the inerrant speech of canonical prophets. He outlines practices for discerning prophecy: submission to **elders**, corporate testing, alignment with **Scripture**, and attentiveness to the **fruits of the Spirit**.

The book ventures into the phenomenology of hearing God, including **impressions**, **dreams**, and **visions**, while marking strong boundaries around authority. Deere insists that God may guide through such means but that no such communication may ground doctrine or override the **Bible's sufficiency**. He addresses pastoral harm from directive prophecies and presents case studies where careful testing avoided manipulation. He targets what he calls evangelical **rationalism** that excludes the possibility of God speaking today and urges an **earnest desire** for spiritual gifts anchored in **1 Corinthians 14**.

#### 5. Ecclesial practice and power evangelism
Deere's ecclesial program is deeply practical, indebted to **John Wimber's** vision of **power evangelism** and **power healing**. He commends training in teams, gentle prayer models, and the cultivation of expectancy within the ordinary life of the church. The aim is not spectacle but mission and mutual edification. He proposes that **healing** and **prophecy** function as signs of the **kingdom** that authenticate the gospel's message to the poor, the sick, and the unchurched, echoing the **Lukan** horizon. He gives rules of engagement: avoid coercion, refuse to promise outcomes, report healings responsibly, and always direct attention to **Christ** rather than to gifted individuals.

In congregational life, Deere urges weaving **charismata** into worship in ways that preserve order and the primacy of the **Word**. Teaching, sacraments, and discipline retain their priority, yet space is made for impressions tested by elders and for testimonies that stir faith. He stresses submission to legitimate authority and refuses autonomy in the exercise of gifts. This modulated charismatic ecclesiology seeks to remain recognizably **evangelical**, not sectarian, and to commend a lived **holiness** inhabited by the **Spirit's** dynamic presence.

#### 6. Interlocutors and hermeneutical scaffolding
Deere frames his work against critics and alongside cautious allies. With **D. A. Carson's** **Showing the Spirit** 1987, he accepts that the Corinthian charismata require careful exegesis and pastoral discipline, yet he resists the reduction of tongues to human languages alone and retains a space for **glossolalia** as prayer. With **Wayne Grudem**, he shares the thesis that **New Testament prophecy** is distinct from canonical prophecy, opening conceptual room for **fallible revelation** that is subordinate to Scripture. With **Craig Keener's** later **Miracles** 2011, he stands in a global evidential tradition that rebuts the sweeping historical claims of hard cessationism.

Against **Richard Gaffin** in **Perspectives on Pentecost** 1979 and **John MacArthur** in **Strange Fire** 2013, Deere presses the inaugurated **eschatology** of **George Eldon Ladd**. The gifts are not relics of an apostolic age, but instruments of a church living between the times. The loci communes are Christological and pneumatological: the exalted **Christ** pours out the **Spirit** upon all flesh as in **Acts 2**, and this ordering remains until the consummation. Deere's hermeneutic reads the narrative of **Acts** not as unrepeatable scaffolding but as normative pattern under apostolic teaching, and thus he resists a strict descriptive-prescriptive divide often invoked by cessationists.

#### 7. Abuses, limits, and a theology of the cross
Deere is acutely aware of charismatic distortions, including authoritarian leadership, manipulative fundraising tied to **prophecy**, and triumphalist **healing** promises. He narrates failures, disappointments, and misfires in **Surprised by the Power of the Spirit** and later in his memoir **Even in Our Darkness** 2018. The memoir is not merely personal; it functions as a theological counterweight, articulating a **theology of the cross** within charismatic spirituality. Suffering, sin, and mortality persist in the present age, and **healing** remains a gift, not a guarantee. The Spirit's presence is known in weakness and lament as well as in power.

This chastened charismatic stance leads Deere to emphasize **sanctification**, **repentance**, and community care in tandem with spiritual gifts. He criticizes prophetic cultures that supplant **Scripture** with fresh words and rejects ministry models that commodify the **Spirit**. He calls for pastoral structures that discipline false prophecy, support the wounded, and protect the vulnerable. This emphasis tempers accusations of naivety and shows a realistic ecclesiology that accounts for sin and immaturity amid charismatic aspiration.

#### 8. Doctrinal contours and constructive payoffs
Doctrinally, Deere integrates **pneumatology**, **ecclesiology**, and **missiology**. He confesses the **finality of the canon** and the doctrinal sufficiency of **Scripture**, while asserting the Spirit's freedom to distribute **charismata** for the church's upbuilding. His definition of **prophecy** as non-inerrant disclosure allows him to retain **Deutero-canonical** severity for Scripture while creating pastoral categories for mistakes without collapsing the entire practice. His **healing** theology is neither mechanistic nor deistic, but covenantal and eschatological, joining faith-filled prayer with readiness to endure.

The constructive payoff is a functional integration of **Word and Spirit** that is not merely formal. Deere argues that the **means of grace** include the preached Word and sacraments but are not exhausted by them. He envisions a church that both proclaims Christ crucified and expects the **Spirit** to confirm the Word through wisdom, prophetic encouragement, timely words of knowledge, and healings that serve love. Theologically, he grounds this in the risen **Christ's** lordship, not in anthropocentric technique, and so he refuses the instrumentation of God while inviting bold petition.

#### 9. Influence and legacy within the Third Wave
Within the **Third Wave** and broader evangelicalism, Deere's two **Surprised** volumes became catechisms for pastors exploring **continuationism** without abandoning **biblical authority**. He served as a bridge figure linking seminary-trained exegesis and **Vineyard** practice, normalizing a lexicon of **fallible prophecy** and **power evangelism** in conservative churches. He helped institutionalize pastoral protocols for testing and using gifts, tamping down disorder while sustaining expectancy. His influence is visible in later works by **Sam Storms** and in the cautious openness of many mission agencies that report **healings** and **dreams** among unreached peoples.

Deere's legacy is also personal and penitential. **Even in Our Darkness** 2018 reframes charismatic power through the lens of brokenness and grace, modeling a spirituality that is both **charismatic** and cruciform. Subsequent reengagements with his theses in new editions and conferences kept his voice present in debates sharpened by critics like **MacArthur**. Though never a systematician in the academic sense, Deere functions as a practical theologian whose arguments feed back into exegetical and dogmatic discussions of **pneumatology** and the **church's mission**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** standpoint, Deere's project exposes substantive tensions around **revelation**, **sufficiency**, and **redemptive history**. The **Westminster Confession of Faith 1.1 and 1.6** speak of the former ways of God's revealing now being ceased and of Scripture's sufficiency for all matters of faith and life, which many take as entailing a principled cessation of new revelatory speech. Deere's distinction between the closed **canon** and ongoing **fallible prophecy** preserves formal **sola Scriptura** but functionally introduces a second tier of divine communication that can guide decisions and shape expectations in the church. Critics in the line of **John Owen**, **Geerhardus Vos**, and **Richard Gaffin** argue that such a schema confuses the unique role of special revelation within the economy of redemption, since the epochal purposes of signs and inspired speech belong to the foundational period that grounds faith in the once-for-all **Christ-event** and its inscripturation. They contend that **1 Corinthians 13** must be read in light of the completion of the redemptive-historical foundation and that **Ephesians 2.20** marks a discontinuity between foundational and superstructural ministries. The Reformed alternative calls the church to the **ordinary means of grace**, the **illumination** of the Spirit in the Word, and the disciplined use of **providence** and wisdom for guidance, resisting categories of **fallible revelation** that blur the Creator-redeemer speech distinction in **Deuteronomy 13 and 18**. At the same time, a judicious Reformed response can affirm Deere's insistence on the living agency of the **Spirit**, the universality of Christ's reign, the reality of divine **healing** answerable to prayer, and the need for pastoral humility in the face of mystery. In principle, a Reformed recalibration would translate Deere's best instincts into a theology of **prayerful dependence**, robust **providence**, and bold mission under the Word, while declining his category of continuing **revelatory gifts** as inconsistent with classical **covenantal** and **redemptive-historical** commitments.
