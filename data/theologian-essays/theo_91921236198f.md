### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and context
Craig G. Bartholomew emerges as a contemporary voice whose work synthesizes **Neo-Calvinist theology**, **biblical hermeneutics**, and **public theology** in the wake of late modern upheavals. South African by origin and trained across continents, his vocation unfolds in the academy and church spanning Africa, North America, and the United Kingdom. In the 1990s he helped launch the multi-volume **Scripture and Hermeneutics Seminar** devoted to the renewal of exegesis for the church, issuing volumes such as **Renewing Biblical Interpretation** 2000 and **Behind the Text: History and Biblical Interpretation** 2003. That initiative located him within debates between **historical criticism**, **postmodern theory**, and **theological interpretation of Scripture**, while rooting him in the **Kuyperian** conviction that all of life is claimed by Christ. His later leadership at the **Kirby Laing Centre for Public Theology in Cambridge** consolidated a vocation oriented to cultural formation and the church’s witness in society, consistent with **Abraham Kuyper’s sphere sovereignty** and **Herman Bavinck’s Reformed catholicity**.

At the conceptual level Bartholomew’s method assumes a chastened **critical realism** indebted to **Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Wirkungsgeschichte**, yet corrected by an Augustinian and canonical rule of faith. He frames knowledge as responsive to **divine address** and disciplined by the *analogia fidei* within the church. This integration resists both **positivist historicism** and **hermeneutical relativism**, aligning him with contemporaries like **Nicholas Wolterstorff** and **Kevin J. Vanhoozer** who advocate realism about meaning, authorial action, and Scripture’s illocutions. The governing plot is a **canonical theodrama** that tells the story of **creation, fall, Israel, Christ, church, and new creation**, thereby resisting fragments of modernity with a thick **worldview**. Within this horizon his emphasis on **wisdom** and **sapiential reading** presents Scripture as pedagogy for living *coram Deo*, not merely as a repository of data for historical reconstruction.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Bartholomew’s hermeneutic begins with the **canon** as Scripture for the church, treating the text as **God’s speech** that addresses readers to form communities, not merely to inform isolated individuals. His **Introducing Biblical Hermeneutics** 2015 offers a comprehensive proposal for hearing Scripture as divine discourse in the power of the Spirit, guided by **creedal rule**, **catechesis**, and **liturgical listening**. He appropriates **Gadamer** for the inevitability of tradition and prejudice in understanding, but he insists that the *telos* of interpretation is obedience to **YHWH** in Christ. This obedience is public and missional, leading to **public theology** that refuses a sacred secular split. The **Kuyperian** category of **creation order** frames both the stability of creational laws and the dynamism of cultural unfolding under **common grace**, even as he insists on the **antithesis** between idolatry and worship as fundamental to cultural analysis.

Theological interpretation for Bartholomew is ecclesial and narratival, yet disciplined by analytic clarity drawn from **Reformed scholasticism** and modern philosophy. He draws on **Thomas Aquinas** to recover **wise metaphysics** that avoids nominalism and grounds created goods in **divine wisdom**, while engaging **Alasdair MacIntyre** to frame traditioned rationality and the craft of reading. In dialogue with **N. T. Wright**, he narrates the Bible as **one story** culminating in the **kingdom of God** revealed in Jesus the Messiah. This story is not merely descriptive but **performative**, calling for faithful improvisation in the church’s **mission of God**. Hence his method is neither a flight to precritical exegesis nor a domestication of Scripture to modernity, but a **Reformed catholic** retrieval that activates a **worldview** for the sake of faithful practice.

#### 3. Canon, narrative, and theodrama
The widely used **The Drama of Scripture** 2004, written with **Michael W. Goheen**, presents the Bible as a **six-act theodrama** from **creation** to **new creation**, with the church called to participate in **Act Five**. This construct operationalizes **Kuyper’s cultural mandate** while safeguarding the centrality of **Christ’s lordship** over every sphere. The companion volume **Living at the Crossroads** 2008 articulates **Christian worldview** as the mind and heart posture that resists modern and postmodern idolatries and embodies **creation-fall-redemption-restoration** across education, politics, arts, and economics. A briefer catechetical exposition, **The True Story of the Whole World** 2009, adapts the same framework for congregational formation, underscoring that all exegesis is for **mission** and **public holiness**. Across these works the axis of **missio Dei** and **public theology** stands out as a hallmark contribution of Bartholomew’s synthesis.

In these narrative accounts, **Scripture** functions as the authoritative plot generator for Christian identity. Drawing on **Vanhoozer’s theodramatic improv** and **Wright’s historical realism**, Bartholomew argues that the church must read and enact Scripture as **canonical drama** rather than merely as systematic propositions or atomized stories. The result is a thick **ecclesial habitus** that enables **wisdom**, fosters **apologetics** grounded in the gospel story rather than neutral reason, and motivates **cultural engagement** that is reformational rather than triumphalist. He thereby restates **Herman Bavinck’s organic worldview** in a register apt for post-Christendom societies searching for meaning beyond technocratic rationality.

#### 4. Wisdom, place, and creation order
Bartholomew’s Old Testament scholarship secures the sapiential spine of his theology. His **Ecclesiastes** 2009 commentary in the Baker series models **canonical, theological, and literary** exegesis that honors the book’s realism about **hebel** vanity while steering readers to **fear of YHWH** as the beginning of wisdom. This sapiential stance funds his programmatic interest in **place**, **dwelling**, and the created order in **Where Mortals Dwell** 2011, where he retrieves **biblical geography** and **sacramental attention to creation** for a theology of habitation. The thrust is not romantic nostalgia but a **Reformed** affirmation that grace restores nature, and that the **cultural mandate** entails healing our alienation from land and neighbor in the light of **new creation**.

This creation-affirming emphasis leads to a constructive account of **public theology** in which **sphere sovereignty** honors the integrity of differentiated social structures, while **common grace** enables cooperation without capitulation to secular ideologies. Bartholomew insists that the **antithesis** remains, since idolatry distorts every sphere, yet the **order of creation** persists under divine governance. In this, his appropriation of **Dooyeweerd’s modal theory** and **Vollenhoven’s law-idea** is implicit, giving philosophical heft to claims about plurality of norms and creational diversity. The result is a **Reformed natural theology** made possible by revelation, eschewing deism while sustaining reason’s capacity to recognize created goods *sub specie Dei*.

#### 5. Hermeneutics and ecclesial reading
The methodological apex of his work is **Introducing Biblical Hermeneutics** 2015, which stages a dialogue between **historical criticism**, **reader-response**, **canonical interpretation**, and **theological interpretation**. Bartholomew presses beyond the dichotomy of exegesis versus theology by showing that **Scripture as divine address** summons the church to hear, trust, and obey. His chapters on **history and ontology** retrieve **Aquinas** and **Augustine** toward a thick metaphysics of creation in which meaning is stable because **God is faithful**. He uses **Gadamer** discerningly to affirm that tradition is inevitable, yet insists that only **Christ the canon within the canon** can norm traditions. The aim is to align exegesis with *lex orandi* and *lex credendi*, so that the **church’s worship** becomes the matrix for hermeneutical formation.

Bartholomew’s collaborative volumes in the **Scripture and Hermeneutics** series, especially **Out of Egypt: Biblical Theology and Biblical Interpretation** 2004 and **The Bible and the University** 2007, broaden the mission. He defends **Christian scholarship** as an outworking of **Kuyper’s vision** that the university cannot be religiously neutral. By invoking **worldview** analysis and **theodrama**, he contends that every discipline is story-laden and value-laden. Properly ordered, the disciplines return to the **fear of the Lord** as the beginning of wisdom and seek the flourishing of the commonwealth under **Christ’s kingship**. The hermeneutic thus expands from churches to classrooms, from pulpits to policy, without losing its **biblical theology** center.

#### 6. Philosophical retrieval and Christian philosophy
Bartholomew’s partnership with **Goheen** in **Christian Philosophy** 2013 consolidates the **Dooyeweerdian** impulse to develop philosophy in obedience to **Scripture**. The volume narrates the history of philosophy through the lenses of **idolatry**, **worldview conflict**, and **creation order**, while advocating a constructive **Reformed metaphysics** under the lordship of Christ. He engages **MacIntyre** on practices and virtue, **Wolterstorff** on justice and liturgy, and **Taylor** on the secular age, translating their insights into the grammar of **creation and covenant**. The aim is not to baptize secular reason but to redirect reason to its true **telos** in wisdom, integrating **ethics**, **epistemology**, and **aesthetics** within a coherent **Kuyperian** frame.

This philosophical retrieval feeds back into exegesis. The critique of **reductionist naturalism** makes space for **miracle**, **providence**, and **divine action** within history, themes that come to the fore in **The God Who Acts in History** 2020. There, Bartholomew contends for **Sinai** as a real event and for **covenant** as the backbone of biblical history, addressing contemporary doubts about **biblical historicity** and **public reason**. He resists both demythologizing skepticism and fideistic retreat, arguing that **critical realism** rightly names the posture of trust that inquires, tests, and confesses. The continuity across his corpus is striking: **theodrama** authorizes a **public truth claim** about God’s acts, while **wisdom** instructs believers in how to inhabit such truth across the domains of culture.

#### 7. Kuyperian tradition and Reformed catholicity
A capstone of Bartholomew’s constructive program is **Contours of the Kuyperian Tradition** 2017, a systematic introduction to **Kuyper**, **Bavinck**, **Dooyeweerd**, and their heirs. The book clarifies the grammar of **sphere sovereignty**, **common grace**, **antithesis**, **worldview**, and **principled pluralism**, while correcting caricatures of **Neo-Calvinism** as monolithic or triumphalist. He stresses **Bavinck’s organic motif** and his **Reformed catholicity** to show that the Kuyperian impulse is capacious and ecumenically open, not sectarian. The goal is a renewal of the **church’s public witness** that is neither Constantinian nor pietist, but a Spirit-shaped engagement of culture that confesses **Christ’s kingship** within every sphere while respecting their integrity.

This retrieval positions Bartholomew within a broad conversation on **two-kingdoms theology**, **natural law**, and **political theology**. He opts for **Kuyperian principled pluralism** as the best mechanism to secure justice in late modern polities, while inviting dialogue with **Augustinian realism** and Catholic social thought. His deployment of **creation order** and **common grace** attempts to preserve a moral grammar intelligible in public without retreating to a thin proceduralism. Thus the book models **Reformed catholicity** as a posture of retrieval and reform that is grounded in **Scripture**, conversant with **tradition**, and responsive to contemporary challenges.

#### 8. Ecclesiology, mission, and pedagogy
Pedagogically, Bartholomew’s voice is formative for the church. Texts like **The Drama of Scripture** and **The True Story of the Whole World** have been widely adopted in seminaries and congregational contexts, shaping catechesis and fueling **missional ecclesiology**. His interpretive emphasis on **the church as Act Five** encourages congregations to read and perform **Scripture** as a script for faithful presence in the world. He insists that evangelism, justice, and creativity belong together under **Christ’s lordship**, resisting both narrow soteriological reductionism and vague social activism. In this way he synthesizes **biblical theology**, **public theology**, and **spiritual formation**, embodying **Bavinck’s** dictum that theology is for the church and the world.

His engagement with **wisdom literature**, **place**, and **creation** also recalibrates pastoral ministry. By integrating **sapiential virtue**, **embodied practices**, and **landed life**, he critiques disembodied spirituality and abstract moralism. The **worldview** lens is not isolated intellectualism but a habitus ordered to **love of God and neighbor**. Homiletically, his approach encourages **expository preaching** that situates pericopes within the **canonical theodrama**, enlivening congregational imagination and strengthening resilience amid secular pressure. The outcome is an ecclesial pedagogy that is narratival, doctrinal, and practical, expressing **Reformed catholicity** for ordinary saints.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and specifically Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Bartholomew’s corpus offers major gifts alongside points of tension. Positively, his **canonical theodrama**, **biblical theology**, and **Kuyperian public theology** resonate with **covenantal revelation**, **Christ’s lordship**, and the **cultural mandate** under **common grace**. His retrieval of **wisdom**, his affirmation of **Scripture as divine address**, and his **critical realist** epistemology strengthen exegesis for the church and encourage cultural obedience to Christ. Yet several cautions arise in principle. First, his reliance on **Gadamerian hermeneutics** and generic **critical realism** risks softening **presuppositional** claims that knowledge is covenantally conditioned, central to **Van Tilian** accounts of the **noetic effects of sin**. A more explicit anchoring in **covenantal epistemology** could correct the impression that realism can be secured without robust **revelational foundations**. Second, the **worldview-theodrama** emphasis can, in practice, overshadow **forensic justification** and the **ordo salutis**, potentially blurring the doctrinal grammar that grounds assurance in **union with Christ** and **imputed righteousness**. Third, the strong **Kuyperian** approach to **sphere sovereignty** and **principled pluralism** can underplay the strengths of a careful **two-kingdoms** distinction that guards the spirituality of the church and the primacy of **Word and sacrament**. Finally, his appreciative retrieval of **Aquinas** and **natural law** needs continual calibration to classical **Reformed confessionalism** on **Scripture’s sufficiency** and **grace restoring nature** rather than elevating nature’s autonomy. None of these tensions nullify his contributions; they invite a Westminster-shaped reception that integrates **redemptive-historical preaching**, **covenantal apologetics**, and **confessional clarity** with his powerful account of **theodrama**, **wisdom**, and **public theology**.
