### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Michael J. Sandel, born in 1953, rose to prominence in the crucible of late twentieth-century American philosophy shaped by **John Rawls** and the debates over liberal neutrality, rights, and the **common good**. Educated in the United States and at Oxford in the 1970s, and joining Harvard University in 1980, Sandel forged a distinctive voice within the seminar rooms and amphitheaters where he taught his famed course **Justice**. The intellectual setting was dominated by **Rawlsian liberalism**, **Nozickian libertarianism**, and technocratic public policy, each wary of substantive moral claims in public life. Against this background, Sandel crafted a method of **public philosophy** that insists democratic citizens must reason together about the *telos* of social goods. His pedagogy made case analysis a mode of civic formation, not simply an exercise in analytic clarity, and his prose traded in examples that exposed the limits of **neutrality** when hard questions of **human flourishing** and **civic virtue** press in.

Sandel’s method is best described as an immanent critique of **liberal deontology** joined to an **Aristotelian** and civic republican recovery of **teleology**. He disputes the liberal picture of the **unencumbered self**, the agent who is prior to and independent of the ends he chooses, and proposes instead an **encumbered self** whose identity is constituted by **constitutive attachments** and communal narratives. The reach of **Kantian autonomy** is thereby challenged, not to deny rights, but to situate rights within a wider account of the **good**. He draws on the resources of **Aristotle** and the American tradition of **republicanism**, arguing that politics is not only a framework for fair cooperation but also a formative enterprise that cultivates **civic virtue** ordered to a shared **common good**. Sandel’s hermeneutic is genealogical and historical as well as analytical, tracing how ideas about **freedom**, **rights**, and **markets** have reshaped American civic life.

Biography feeds into practice. Sandel served from 2002 to 2005 on the President’s Council on Bioethics under **Leon Kass**, where questions of **human dignity**, **enhancement**, and the limits of markets in medicine demanded nonneutral judgments. His BBC **Reith Lectures** in 2009 on a new citizenship announced to a global audience his determination that publics can deliberate about **moral goods** without collapsing into sectarianism. Through the lecture hall and popular books, Sandel modeled a method of **reason-giving** that encourages citizens to move beyond purely **procedural** claims to substantive judgments of **worth** and *telos*.

#### 2. Liberalism, the self, and the good
Sandel’s first major work, **Liberalism and the Limits of Justice** (1982, 2nd ed. 1998), delivered a searching internal critique of **Rawls**. Rawls’s project in A Theory of Justice proposed that principles of justice should be chosen from an original position under a veil of ignorance so that the **right** would be prior to the **good**. Sandel argues that such a construction relies upon a conception of the person as the **unencumbered self**, abstracted from its ends and communal bonds. For Sandel, this yields a thin anthropology and an impoverished civic vision, because actual agents do not stand before the world as free choosers of ends ex nihilo but rather as bearers of narratives, obligations, and **constitutive attachments** that give shape to identity. On his view, the key to justice is not the purity of procedure but the fittingness of practices to their **internal goods** and purposes, an **Aristotelian teleology** that recognizes goods as more than preferences.

The exchange with **Rawls** matured with Rawls’s **Political Liberalism** in 1993, which moved toward an overlapping consensus among reasonable comprehensive doctrines. Sandel remained unconvinced that such **neutrality** could sustain a robust public life, since the avoidance of metaphysical or moral claims often smuggles in a liberal anthropology through the back door. The priority of the **right** over the **good** still hides a theory of the good, namely the good of unimpeded **autonomy**. Sandel contended that civic life must sometimes elevate goods on nonneutral grounds through contestation about their *telos* and meaning. The liberal aspiration to a politics without thick moral commitments misunderstands how citizens actually reason about justice and how **civic virtue** is formed.

The implication is neither theocratic imposition nor authoritarianism, but a recovered **civic republicanism** that trusts democratic deliberation to order common life toward **shared ends**. This account attends to **membership** and **obligation** that precede choice, including familial, local, and national bonds that are not mere contracts. In sum, Sandel’s anthropology of the **encumbered self** calls into question the liberal picture of persons and aims to rehabilitate debates about **moral desert**, **civic sacrifice**, and **honor** as intelligible features of a healthy polity.

#### 3. Civic republicanism and the American story
In **Democracy’s Discontent** (1996), Sandel widened the lens from abstract theory to the American narrative of **freedom**, **citizenship**, and the **common good**. He contrasted a tradition of **civic republicanism**, which understands liberty as self-rule ordered to the **public good**, with a **procedural republic** that treats citizens as bearers of rights seeking private satisfaction. Through a reading of the American founding, **Madison**, **Jefferson**, **Tocqueville**, and judicial developments in the twentieth century, he traced how the procedural republic displaced the formative projects of civic life. Corporate concentration, the decline of local self-governance, and the ascendancy of consumer culture together undermined the practices that sustain **civic virtue** and **solidarity**. Sandel contended that reviving the **public philosophy** of republican citizenship would require institutional reforms that foster participation, locally rooted economic life, and a renewed esteem for the **goods of common life**.

The argument is historical and normative. Historically, Sandel claims that the older republican idiom has recurrently surfaced among American dissenters wary of mere **market freedom**. Normatively, he maintains that the promise of democracy cannot be reduced to the aggregation of preferences within a neutral framework. Rather, it requires the **cultivation of character** through civic practices that school citizens in the virtues required for **self-government**. The analysis suggests that the health of democracies turns on whether institutions honor the **telos** of citizenship. The **common good** is not a lowest common denominator but a thick set of purposes toward which citizens can be educated and to which they can be attached.

#### 4. Markets, corruption, and the hierarchy of goods
Sandel’s interrogation of **market triumphalism** crystallized in **What Money Can’t Buy** (2012), which advanced a twofold critique of marketization: the **fairness** objection and the **corruption** objection. Fairness questions unequal access; corruption addresses how markets can crowd out or degrade **higher goods** by misvaluing them. He cataloged examples of commodification that erode the meaning of practices: line-standing for profit that undermines **civic equality**, naming rights that cheapen **public honor**, pollution permits that change the moral meaning of **environmental stewardship**, and cash incentives that distort **education** by replacing intrinsic motives. The key is that certain goods have a **telos** that cannot be cashed out as preference satisfaction without loss. This is an unapologetically **perfectionist** claim about the qualitative ranking of goods and virtues, one that liberal neutrality cannot easily accommodate.

The work sharpened Sandel’s central thesis that public deliberation must ask what social practices are for and what virtues they ought to foster. A **market mechanism** is not morally inert. It encodes judgments and social scripts. The attempt to keep markets morally neutral founders on the fact that markets shape identities and signal what society honors. Sandel employs a civic **virtue ethics** that treats markets as tools to be limited or redirected when they corrupt *bonum commune*. The normative horizon is the **common good**, which requires democratic societies to decide, through reasoned argument, how to align institutional incentives with the **internal goods** of practices.

#### 5. Bioethics, giftedness, and humility
In **The Case Against Perfection** (2007), drawing on his work with the President’s Council on Bioethics, Sandel explored the moral limits of **genetic enhancement**, designer children, and the pursuit of **hyperagency**. He introduced the language of **giftedness** to describe a posture of humility and gratitude before the unbidden. The aspiration to mastery over the traits of children and athletes threatens to replace solidarity with **hubris**, to erode a sense of the **moral equal** worth of persons, and to impoverish the meanings internal to parenting, sport, and education. The moral register is not only distributive fairness but also the fitting stance toward **creaturely limits** and the goods internal to practices.

This analysis extends Sandel’s anti-neutral stance to the heart of embodied life. The goods at stake in procreation and achievement cannot be captured by aggregative measures. They require judgments about the **telos** of parenthood and the **virtues** that should accompany receiving life as a gift. Sandel’s appeal to **giftedness** implicitly draws on long traditions that speak of **grace** and **gratitude**, though he stays within a secular vocabulary of **humility** and **shared fate**. The point is that good societies cultivate an ethos that resists the domination of **technocratic control**, choosing instead to honor the **dignity** of the given in human life.

#### 6. Teaching justice and recovering public reason-giving
The best-known popular distillation of Sandel’s project is **Justice: What’s the Right Thing to Do?** (2009), which stages encounters among **utilitarianism**, **libertarianism**, **Kantian deontology**, and **Aristotelian virtue ethics**. Sandel presents **Bentham** and **Mill** as illuminating yet finally reductionist, **Nozick** as an acute defender of liberty whose rights-talk lacks a robust account of **community** and **desert**, and **Kant** as a defender of **dignity** whose abstraction threatens to sever moral judgment from the goods and narratives that give it traction. He commends an **Aristotelian** approach that brings teleology and **virtue** into public discussion. The book illustrates his conviction that democratic life improves when citizens argue candidly about their **moral convictions**, rather than disguising them as neutral.

The companion collection **Public Philosophy** (2005) presses the same theme. The injunction to keep comprehensive moral and religious convictions out of public life, Sandel argues, produces a politics thin in **meaning**, vulnerable to special interests, and unable to inspire **solidarity**. Rather than banishing thick convictions, a confident democracy should structure institutions and norms so that such convictions can meet one another under **civic virtues** of patience, humility, and reason-giving. This is a vision of **deliberative democracy** ordered not to procedural consensus but to discernment of the **common good**.

#### 7. Merit, luck, and contributive justice
Sandel’s late work **The Tyranny of Merit** (2020) returns to the economic and cultural fractures of contemporary democracies and attacks the hubris of **meritocracy**. He argues that the rhetoric of rising, coupled with a competitive credentialed economy, breeds **winner-take-all** inequalities and moralizes success as deserved. The losers in this system suffer not only economically but also the **humiliation** of being told their station is their fault. Sandel proposes recovering **contributive justice** rather than an exclusive focus on distribution, which means honoring the social esteem owed to the **work of all**, reconnecting reward to contribution, and sustaining the civic **dignity** of labor.

This analysis extends his older critique of **autonomy** by highlighting **luck** and **giftedness** in human success. The language of **grace** surfaces as a secular moral insight: what we receive exceeds what we merit. That recognition should temper the **hubris** of winners, animate solidarity with those left behind, and recalibrate policy toward the **common good**. In Sandel’s hands, the remedy for populist resentment is not technocracy but moral repair through **humility**, **reciprocity**, and renewed **civic bonds**. He again urges a politics that dares to ask what social honors and arrangements ought to express, given our shared dependence and the **telos** of democratic life.

#### 8. Development, interlocutors, and criticisms
Across four decades, the through-line of Sandel’s corpus is the rehabilitation of **teleology** and **virtue** in public life against the liberal ideal of **neutrality**. From the **unencumbered self** critique to analyses of **market corruption**, **giftedness**, and **meritocracy**, he seeks a politics ordered to the **common good** through inclusive **deliberation**. While associated with **communitarianism** alongside **MacIntyre**, **Taylor**, and **Walzer**, Sandel resists the label when it implies an uncritical deference to tradition or a wholesale rejection of rights. He retains classic **liberal rights** as political achievements but insists they must be situated within a robust account of **human flourishing**. His public work has amplified these themes through celebrated teaching, the BBC **Reith Lectures**, and widely translated books that invite nonphilosophers into serious **moral argument**.

Critics charge Sandel with **perfectionism** that risks moral majoritarianism, where the **common good** collapses into the preferences of the powerful. Others worry that his appeals to **civic virtue** romanticize community and underplay the need for **structural justice**. Sandel answers by emphasizing **deliberative inclusion**, protections for **minority rights**, and qualitative distinctions among goods that democratic citizens can and must contest. He also rejects technocratic managerialism, arguing that expertise must be disciplined by public judgment about **ends**. The enduring point is that there is no escape from the work of moral evaluation. Societies will always honor some goods over others. The question is whether they will do so candidly, with reasons, and under norms of **civic equality**.

Sandel’s philosophical vocabulary often resonates with theological traditions without invoking confessional claims. His talk of **giftedness** evokes **grace**; his defense of **telos** echoes **natural law**; his description of **humility** contrasts with civic **hubris**. These resonances have made his work a significant conversation partner for theologians interested in **public theology**, **virtue ethics**, and the critique of **market idolatry**. At the same time, his project remains a secular appeal to shared **practical reason** oriented to the **bonum commune**.

In a Reformed and WTS evaluation, Sandel’s project offers both alignment and tension with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. Positively, his rejection of **autonomous reason** and **liberal neutrality** aligns with a **covenantal** picture of persons embedded in **communities**, a **teleological** creation order, and the reality of **common grace** that makes civic reasoning possible. His critique of **meritocracy** and embrace of **giftedness** resonate with **grace alone**, pushing public life away from self-congratulation toward humility and **solidarity**, while his exposure of **market corruption** echoes Reformed alarms about **idolatries** of Mammon. Yet there are cautions. Absent **special revelation**, Sandel’s perfectionist **common good** risks becoming a baptized form of civic Pelagianism, overestimating the capacity of **virtue formation** under conditions of **total depravity** to bind a fractured polity. His republican stress on formative politics presses against **two-kingdoms** and **sphere sovereignty** instincts that protect the **freedom of conscience**, the differentiation of social orders, and the primacy of **worship** as ordered to God alone. A Reformed alternative would welcome Sandel’s retrieval of **teleology** and public reasoning about **goods**, while grounding the **common good** in **lex Dei**, guarding against moral majoritarianism through covenantal limits on state vocation, and reframing **giftedness** within the richer grammar of **creation**, **fall**, and **redemption**. On this account, Christians may partner in Sandelian projects of **deliberation** and **market critique**, yet insist that durable civic hope leans not only on shared prudence but on the regenerating power of the **gospel** that alone heals the pride and despair that **meritocracy** breeds.
