### TITLE
David Garner sharpens contemporary Reformed theology by defending confessional catholicity, Trinitarian missions, and Spirit‑wrought adoption against evangelical reductionism and ecumenical vagueness.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **David B. Garner** is a late twentieth and early twenty first century American **Reformed** theologian formed within the postwar conservative Presbyterian and **evangelical** movements.
- Teaching at **Westminster Theological Seminary** since the mid 2000s, he labors amid debates over **confessionalism**, global **mission**, and evangelical **biblicism**.

- Garner self consciously operates as a confessional **Reformed** theologian, subordinating all method to **Scripture** as the self authenticating Word of the triune God.
- Methodologically he integrates **biblical theology** and **systematic theology**, in the line of **Vos** and **Van Til**, emphasizing redemptive historical **revelation** and covenant.
- He is sharply critical of experiential or sociological models of **ecclesiology**, defending a divinely instituted, **confessional church** and robust churchly authority.

- In **How Can I Know For Sure?** 2014, Garner articulates the **doctrine of assurance** as grounded in Christ and the promises of God rather than in introspective subjectivism.
- **Sons in the Son** 2016 is his major work on **adoption**, arguing that filial identity in the incarnate Son is a central, not peripheral, soteriological reality.
- In **Getting the Gospel Right** 2020, he critiques contemporary **evangelicalism** and defends a full‑orbed, churchly conception of the **gospel** beyond individual decisionism.
- As editor of **Did God Really Say?** 2012 and **Tabletalk** articles, he engages debates about **inerrancy**, confessional **subscription**, and the nature of biblical authority.
- His articles on **Trinitarian missions** and **missiology** argue that church **mission** must be normed by the missions of the **Trinity** and the instituted means of grace.

- Garner is especially important for the loci of **revelation and Scripture**, defending inerrancy, clarity, and the self attesting authority of the Bible.
- He has made significant contributions to **soteriology**, especially the doctrines of union with Christ, **adoption**, and assurance.
- He also weighs in on **ecclesiology and mission**, emphasizing the visible church, confessional standards, and the Trinitarian shape of global **evangelization**.

- For a Westminster exam committee, Garner is a relatively safe **Reformed** voice whose work can be received as an extension of **confessional orthodoxy**.
- Yet they will expect you to show how his emphases on **adoption**, the **church**, and the gospel correct deficiencies in broader American evangelical theology.

- Comparison handles include **Garner vs popular evangelicalism** on the nature of assurance, the gospel, and the church.
- Another useful contrast is **Garner and Bavinck** on adoption and union with Christ, as well as **Garner and Van Til** on Scripture and **revelation**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
David B. Garner is a contemporary **Reformed** theologian whose ministry has unfolded in the late twentieth and early twenty first century American **Presbyterian** and evangelical context. Educated within conservative Reformed institutions and serving most prominently at **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia, he stands in the institutional line of **Machen**, **Van Til**, and **Vos**, yet writes into a very different ecclesial landscape shaped by the rise of neo evangelicalism, church growth pragmatism, and later the missional and emergent church movements. His vocational setting includes pastoral ministry, theological education, and denominational engagement within **conservative Presbyterianism**, giving his work a firmly ecclesial cast rather than a purely academic one.

The driving problem of Garner’s theology is the fragmentation and reduction of **Reformed** faith in broader evangelicalism, especially the loss of a robust doctrine of the church, a thinned out account of the **gospel**, and a neglect of filial grace and **adoption**. In the late twentieth century, American evangelical theology frequently collapsed salvation into individual decision, reduced theology to private Bible reading, and understood the church as a voluntary association or a pragmatic platform for mission, rather than as the ordained embassy of the **kingdom of God**. Garner perceives that this reductionist mindset distorts the doctrines of **Scripture**, the church, and salvation, so that assurance becomes psychological, mission becomes anthropocentric, and the Christian life is detached from its Christological and Trinitarian center.

Against this backdrop, Garner’s mature work seeks to reassert a thick, confessional **Reformed** orthodoxy in the idiom of contemporary evangelical discourse. His writings on **Scripture**, the church, adoption, and assurance are not speculative projects but pastoral and polemical correctives to specific trends, such as the erosion of biblical inerrancy, the marginalization of **confessions**, and the therapeutic recasting of salvation. The presenting problem is therefore how to retrieve a comprehensive, Christ centered, churchly vision of the **gospel** that is faithful to historic Reformed confessions yet alert to global circumstances and new questions. In this sense, he stands as a bridge figure between classic **Reformed scholastic** concerns and current evangelical debates.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Methodologically, David Garner works as an explicitly **confessional Reformed** theologian whose primary epistemic authority is the self attesting **Scripture** of the triune God. Deeply influenced by **Van Til** and the apologetic ethos of Westminster, he affirms the principial distinction between the Creator and the creature and insists that true **knowledge of God** is covenantal and revelational rather than autonomous or neutral. In his work on inerrancy, such as the edited volume **Did God Really Say?** 2012, Garner argues that Scripture is not simply an inspired record of religious experience but the very **Word of God**, possessing divine authority and veracity by virtue of its divine authorship. **Revelation** for Garner is therefore fundamentally verbal, covenantal, and Christocentric, reaching its climax in the incarnate Son yet inscripturated in the canonical Scriptures for the church.

Garner’s use of **reason** is characteristically Reformed and Van Tillian. He rejects both rationalistic foundationalism and postmodern relativism, affirming instead that human reason is a derivative, covenantally situated faculty that must submit to **special revelation**. He employs careful exegesis and redemptive historical argument, but he never grants an independent magisterial role to philosophical reasoning or human experience. In epistemological debates over certainty and assurance, as in **How Can I Know For Sure?** 2014, he contends that assurance must rest on the **promises of God** in Christ, as attested in Scripture and sealed by the Spirit, rather than on introspective analysis of religious feeling. He is therefore wary of any experientialist or evidentialist models that place the ground of assurance in the subject rather than in the objectivity of divine **revelation**.

Experience and **history** function in Garner’s method as important but derivative. He recognizes the significance of the church’s historical reflection, citing the **Reformed confessions** and theologians such as **Calvin** and **Bavinck** approvingly, yet he treats the confessional standards as subordinate, ministerial, and normed by the Bible. The **church** is for Garner a divinely instituted, visible community to which the oracles of God have been entrusted, and its historical witness is a providential guide and guardrail. In his critiques of contemporary evangelicalism in **Getting the Gospel Right** 2020, he charges that evangelical culture often replaces confessional and ecclesial norms with sociological descriptions or pragmatic strategies. For Garner, by contrast, the church’s identity and mission are determined by the exegesis of Scripture and the **Trinitarian** economy, not by cultural plausibility or historical precedent. Tensions with classical Reformed method are minimal; the more pressing tensions lie between Garner and nonconfessional evangelical approaches that subordinate **doctrine** to perceived missional effectiveness.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

Garner’s first major locus is **revelation and Scripture**. The confessional baseline, as articulated in **Westminster Confession of Faith** chapter 1, is that Scripture is the only sufficient, certain, and infallible rule of all saving knowledge, faith, and obedience, given by inspiration of God and to be believed because it is the Word of God. In **Did God Really Say?** 2012, Garner and his co contributors defend precisely this baseline against challenges from within and without evangelicalism that seek to deconstruct inerrancy, relativize biblical authority, or redescribe Scripture as a merely human witness. Garner insists that the Bible is **inerrant**, clear, and self authenticating, and he directly engages opponents such as **Peter Enns** and postconservative theologians who emphasize the Bible’s historical conditionedness at the expense of its divine origin. He stresses that the triune God speaks authoritatively in Scripture and that to question biblical truthfulness is to impugn the character of **God** himself. Thus Garner reinforces the classic Reformed doctrine of **revelation**, aligning closely with **Warfield** and **Van Til**.

A second decisive locus is **soteriology**, especially union with Christ and **adoption**. The classic Reformed baseline, evident in **Calvin**, **Turretin**, and **Bavinck**, holds that salvation is located in the believer’s **union with Christ**, from which justification, sanctification, and glorification flow, and that adoption is a distinct benefit of that union whereby we are received into the number and have a right to all the privileges of the sons of God. In **Sons in the Son** 2016, Garner argues that adoption is not a mere appendage to justification nor a sentimental metaphor but a central and structuring soteriological reality grounded in the eternal filial identity of the incarnate **Son**. He contends that in union with Christ believers are brought into the Son’s own filial relation to the Father by the Spirit, so that adoption has a robust **Trinitarian** shape. Interacting with interlocutors such as **J. I. Packer**, whose Knowing God treats adoption as the highest privilege of the gospel but does not fully systematize it, Garner seeks to locate adoption more deeply in Christology and in the decree, thereby enriching Reformed accounts of salvation. He resists any move, however, to collapse justification into adoption or to weaken the forensic dimension of **justification**, maintaining clear but coordinated distinctions.

A third focal area is **assurance and the gospel**. The Reformed confessional baseline, articulated in **Westminster Confession of Faith** 18, affirms that true believers may in this life be certainly assured that they are in the state of grace, such assurance not being of the essence of faith but ordinarily flowing from faith by the Spirit through the promises, the inward evidences of grace, and the testimony of the **Spirit of adoption**. In **How Can I Know For Sure?** 2014 and in **Getting the Gospel Right** 2020, Garner presses against evangelical patterns that ground assurance in the memory of a decision, a sinner’s prayer, or fluctuating feelings. He argues that the **gospel** is not a minimal decisionistic formula but the announcement of Christ’s saving work and lordship, requiring incorporation into Christ by **faith** as mediated through the ministry of the church. Engaging the broader evangelical culture and interacting with figures influenced by revivalism and **Finneyite** techniques, Garner urges a recovery of objective, Christ centered assurance that looks outward to Christ’s finished work and to the promises sealed in the sacraments. Thus he aligns assurance closely with union with Christ and the Spirit’s witness, in keeping with classical Reformed emphases.

A fourth important locus is **ecclesiology and mission**. Confessionally, the church is described in **Westminster Confession of Faith** 25 as the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ, the house and family of God, into which ordinary men cannot be saved without belonging, and is instituted with officers, ordinances, and discipline for the gathering and perfecting of the saints. In articles and lectures on **missiology**, Garner argues that mission is not a free floating activity of Christians but the outworking of the **Trinitarian missions** through the instituted church. Drawing on the missions of the **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**, he contends that the church’s mission should be ordered by Scripture, carried out through Word and sacrament, and expressed in the planting and strengthening of confessional churches rather than in ad hoc movements. Interacting critically with broad evangelical and so called missional church literature, he warns against reducing mission to social activism, cultural engagement, or numerical expansion. Instead, he defends a theologically thick account of **evangelism** and church planting that is ecclesiocentric and doctrinally robust, standing much closer to **Vos** and **Kuyper** than to pragmatist church growth paradigms.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
David Garner intentionally positions himself as a continuer and contextualizer of classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, rather than as a revisionist. He regularly appeals to **Calvin**, **Turretin**, **Bavinck**, and **Vos** as allies, adopting their commitments to the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture**, the centrality of union with Christ, and the organic unity of special revelation. For instance, his defense of inerrancy and the self attestation of Scripture is deeply indebted to **Warfield** and **Van Til**, and his covenantal understanding of revelation reflects Vosian **biblical theology**. Likewise, his account of adoption retrieves strands already present in **Bavinck** and **Murray**, though he gives them a more central, synthetic place. In this way, Garner stands within a tradition of Reformed ressourcement that seeks not to innovate doctrinally but to deepen and clarify neglected themes in continuity with the confessions.

A Westminster examiner will, however, identify certain pressure points for objection or at least for probing. First, because Garner writes in a pastoral and popular key in works like **Getting the Gospel Right**, there is a constant temptation for readers to hear his critiques of evangelicalism as purely sociological rather than as dogmatic, and an examiner may ask whether his polemics adequately distinguish between different strands within **evangelicalism**. The non negotiable concern for a Westminster committee is that any critique of evangelical gospel reductionism must not weaken the forensic core of **justification by faith alone** or the centrality of penal substitutionary atonement, and they will expect the candidate to show that Garner upholds these as essential. Second, in elevating adoption to a central soteriological locus in **Sons in the Son**, Garner must be read carefully so as not to imply any subordination of **justification** or any speculative extension of filial notions into areas like eternal generation that would trespass classical **Trinitarian** boundaries. While Garner himself works hard to stay within confessional lines, the examiner may push on whether his language about sonship adequately preserves the Creator creature distinction and the uniqueness of the only begotten **Son**.

At the same time, there are clear places where Reformed theologians can learn from Garner. His retrieval and expansion of **adoption** as a central benefit of union with Christ both corrects a genuine lacuna in much Reformed preaching and catechesis and enriches our grasp of the Trinitarian shape of salvation. His insistence that mission is ordered by **Trinitarian** revelation, and that the church’s commission must be exercised through instituted means of grace, offers a much needed corrective to pragmatic or activist models of mission. Moreover, his defense of inerrancy is not a bare repetition of older arguments but a contextualized address to new forms of **biblicism**, critical scholarship, and postconservative theology. In reception, Garner is still a contemporary figure, so secondary literature is limited, but within confessional Presbyterian circles he is regarded as a reliable expounder of **Reformed** orthodoxy, one whose work is likely to shape future discussions of adoption, assurance, and ecclesiology.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, several sentences drawn from Garner’s emphases are safe as opening lines. One could say, for example, that **David Garner is a contemporary confessional Reformed theologian who labors to recover a thick, churchly and Trinitarian account of the gospel within a fragmented evangelical landscape**. Another safe summary is that **Garner’s theology centers on the self attesting Scripture, the centrality of union with Christ and adoption, and the ecclesial shape of mission**. Phrases such as **self attesting Word of God**, **Trinitarian missions**, and **sons in the Son** can be used positively, provided they are immediately tethered to confessional formulations of **revelation**, the **Trinity**, and union with Christ. You can also safely emphasize that **Garner stands within the Westminster and Van Til tradition, updating its concerns for questions of adoption, assurance, and global mission**.

There are also phrases that require care and qualification. Because **adoption** has become a contemporary buzzword, one must avoid speaking as if Garner makes adoption the entire content of salvation or as if he relativizes **justification**. Avoid unqualified statements such as **for Garner, adoption replaces justification as the center of soteriology**; instead, say that he **elevates adoption to its proper centrality within a broader union with Christ framework while maintaining the distinct forensic role of justification**. Similarly, when discussing his criticisms of **evangelicalism**, avoid sweeping statements that imply he rejects evangelical identity altogether; clarify that he critiques specific evangelical distortions of the **gospel** and the church while functioning as a Reformed evangelical himself. Do not casually apply phrases like **vicarious humanity** in a Torrancean sense or **perichoretic mission** without immediately tying them to standard Reformed Christology and **Trinitarian** doctrine, since examiners will be alert to Barthian or Torrancean overtones that Garner does not endorse.

Typical misunderstandings that examiners might exploit include the assumption that Garner’s focus on assurance yields a more subjective, introspective model, when in fact he presses toward objective Christ centered assurance. Another misunderstanding is to think that his emphasis on adoption and filial identity drifts toward a theosis model that blurs the Creator creature distinction, which would alarm a Westminster examiner concerned about maintaining classical **theology proper** and the archetype ectype distinction. You should be ready to insist that Garner’s **sons in the Son** language remains covenantal and forensic and does not entail any ontological participation in the divine essence. Finally, some students might assume that because Garner writes accessibly, his work lacks dogmatic depth; an examiner may ask you to show how his positions are anchored in the **Westminster Standards**, in **Bavinck**, and in **Vos**, and it will be crucial to articulate those connections clearly and specifically.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, David Garner is a welcome contemporary exponent of **confessional Reformed** theology whose work on **Scripture**, adoption, assurance, and the church largely strengthens and extends the tradition rather than revising it, so we should affirm his robust doctrine of inerrant, self attesting revelation, his Trinitarian and Christocentric account of union with Christ and **adoption**, and his insistence that the gospel and mission are ecclesially located, while denying that any of these emphases can be allowed to eclipse or relativize the non negotiable Reformation core of justification by faith alone and the once for all penal substitutionary work of Christ, and if asked where I land I would say that Garner offers an exemplary contemporary model of how to retrieve and apply **Westminster** theology in a fractured evangelical context, and that I embrace his main lines while remaining vigilant, with the tradition, to preserve the Creator creature distinction and the distinct yet inseparable benefits of Christ in a fully **Trinitarian** frame.

- He integrates **biblical theology** and systematic theology in the line of **Vos**, reading redemptive history as the unfolding of covenantal **revelation** centered on Christ.
- Experience and history, including the **Reformed confessions**, function ministerially as guides under Scripture rather than as independent epistemic norms.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Garner defends the classic doctrine of biblical **inerrancy** and clarity, insisting in **Did God Really Say?** that to deny Scripture’s truthfulness is to impugn **God** himself.
- In **Sons in the Son** he elevates **adoption** to a central soteriological benefit grounded in union with the incarnate **Son** and framed by the **Trinity**.
- He critiques decisionistic **evangelicalism** in **Getting the Gospel Right**, arguing that the **gospel** is the comprehensive announcement of Christ’s saving work mediated through the church.
- In **How Can I Know For Sure?** he teaches that **assurance** rests objectively on Christ’s promises and the Spirit’s witness rather than on fluctuating feelings or past decisions.
- His ecclesiology and missiology emphasize that **mission** is the extension of the Trinitarian missions through the instituted, confessional **church** by Word and sacrament.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Examiners will press whether Garner’s elevation of **adoption** maintains clear distinctions from **justification** and avoids any drift toward theosis or confusion of Creator and creature.
- They will ask whether his critique of **evangelicalism** preserves the forensic core of **justification by faith alone** and penal substitutionary atonement.
- They may probe how his Van Tillian stance on **revelation** and the self attesting Scripture resists both evidentialist rationalism and postmodern relativism.
- They will want clarity that his **Trinitarian missions** and ecclesial missiology do not undermine the sufficiency of Scripture or the centrality of the instituted **church**.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Garner vs popular evangelicalism** contrasts a churchly, doctrinally thick **gospel** with decisionistic, individualistic models of salvation.
- **Garner and Bavinck on adoption** shows continuity in treating **adoption** as a distinct benefit of union with Christ, with Garner giving it greater systematic prominence.
- **Garner and Van Til on Scripture** highlights shared commitments to the self attesting **Word of God**, inerrancy, and the Creator creature epistemic distinction.
- **Garner vs missional pragmatism** contrasts a **Trinitarian**, church centered **mission** with sociological and activist approaches in contemporary evangelicalism.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- **David Garner should be received as a faithful contemporary Reformed theologian whose retrieval of adoption, assurance, and ecclesial mission strengthens Westminster orthodoxy, provided we guard the non negotiable centrality of justification and the classical Trinitarian and Creator creature distinctions.**
