### ESSAY
Matthew S. Harmon is a contemporary evangelical biblical theologian whose vocation is to read the whole Bible in light of a single divine intention centered on **Jesus Christ** and the **church** as the **Servant people**. His work is located in the intellectual ecology shaped by post-New Perspective discussions on **Paul**, the resurgence of canonical **biblical theology** in the wake of **Geerhardus Vos**, and sustained attention to **intertextuality** catalyzed by **Richard B. Hays**. Teaching at Grace College and Theological Seminary in Winona Lake and trained within the Wheaton stream of evangelical scholarship, Harmon occupies a space between the academy and the church, writing both an academic **commentary on Philippians** and accessible guides like **Asking the Right Questions**. The unity of his corpus is a theological reading of Scripture that sees **exile and restoration**, **Servant identity**, and **inaugurated eschatology** as mutually interpreting threads within one **covenantal** drama.

#### 1. Method: canonical realism, intertextual discipline, and pastoral application
Harmon’s method is a recognizable evangelical synthesis of **grammatical-historical exegesis** and **canonical** interpretation, foregrounding the Bible’s **divine authorship** and the unity of the **covenant storyline**. He affirms that the human authors intended what they wrote in particular historical contexts, yet also that God intends more, such that **typology** and **promise-fulfillment** come to light across the canon without dissolving authorial integrity. Here his debt to **G. K. Beale** is visible in the attention to temple, new creation, and the **already and not yet**, while his appropriation of **Richard B. Hays** is cautious, adopting criteria for identifying **echoes** and **allusions** yet tamping down speculative intertext. Against the thinner textuality of some **canonical criticism**, Harmon’s stress on the authorial discourse of **Isaiah**, **Paul**, and **Luke-Acts** preserves historical particularity while inviting figural rereading in the light of the **Christ-event**. The result is a hermeneutic that reads from *ad litteram* to *ad plenitudinem* without leaving the rails of the text, an approach he commends to the church in **Asking the Right Questions** through God-centered reading practices that feed **sanctification**.

Harmon’s earliest major academic footprint appears in his sustained work on **Philippians**, especially in the **Evangelical Exegetical Commentary** volume from 2015, complemented by **Philippians: Through Old Testament Eyes** in 2020. In the commentary he defends a robust **high Christology** in the **Christ hymn** of Philippians 2.5-11, reading μορφη θεου as a claim to preexistent divine status and κενωσις as the addition of **servant** mode rather than the subtraction of **divine attributes**, thereby resisting **kenotic Christology** while emphasizing the Isaianic **Servant**’s voluntary humiliation. This exegetical judgment coheres with his larger biblical-theological program: the **Servant of the Lord** takes the form of **Israel**’s vocation and fulfills it in the obedience of the Son, so that the church’s **union with Christ** grounds both cross-shaped **ethics** and resurrection-shaped **hope**. In the 2020 volume he shows how the letter’s themes, such as heavenly **citizenship**, **suffering**, and **mission**, are saturated with **Old Testament** imagery, especially new exodus and **exile** reversal, thereby teaching congregations to read the New Testament with **Old Testament eyes**.

If the Philippians work exemplifies Harmon’s Christological and ecclesial instincts, **Rebels and Exiles: A Biblical Theology of Sin and Restoration** from 2020 supplies the axial hamartiology and soteriology of his canon-wide reading. Here Harmon proposes that human **sin** is a rebellion that effects **exile** from the presence of God, beginning in **Eden** and unfolding through **Babel**, **Egypt**, **Assyria**, and **Babylon**, with resonances in **Rome** and the powers. He interacts appreciatively yet critically with the **N. T. Wright** thesis that Second Temple Judaism perceived itself as still in exile, affirming the motif’s power while preventing it from becoming a totalizing grid. Theologically he argues that **restoration** is God’s gracious act to bring his people back into his presence through the **new exodus** accomplished by the **Messiah**, climaxing in **new covenant** communion and extending to the **new creation**. Harmon’s hallmark is the coordination of cosmic and ecclesial horizons: exile is both relational and spatial, personal and systemic, thus restoration must be **reconciliatory** and **recreational**, culminating in a pilgrim people who are at once already home and not yet home in the **kingdom**.

Complementing the exile-restoration motif, **The Servant of the Lord and His Servant People** from 2021 exegetes the Isaianic **Servant** across the canon and correlates it with the **church’s identity** and **mission**. Drawing on **Alec Motyer** and **John N. Oswalt** for the literary-theological contour of Isaiah 40-55, Harmon argues that the Servant figure retains both corporate and individual dimensions, resolving in the one **Messiah** who gathers and then extends his vocation to a Spirit-indwelt community. He tracks the Servant songs across **Luke-Acts** and **Paul**, showing how themes of light to the nations, suffering obedience, and vindication shape the **Great Commission** and the church’s **sacrificial service**. Importantly, he resists conflations that erase the particularity of **Israel** while also insisting that the cruciform pattern of the Servant is constitutive of **Christian discipleship**. This alignment enables ecclesiology to be missionary without triumphalism and to be cruciform without quietism.

The methodological bridge to the church is explicit in **Asking the Right Questions: A Practical Guide to Understanding and Applying the Bible** from 2017, where Harmon equips readers with two sets of questions oriented to **God** and to **people**, derived from a theology of **Scripture** as a divine-human word. The hermeneutic is saturated with **gospel** categories: every text reveals the character and purposes of God in **Christ**, exposes human need in **sin**, directs trust to **grace**, and shapes concrete **obedience** within the **covenant** community. The prominence of application is not a retreat from exegesis but its ethical telos in service of **sanctification** and **mission**. The book models how an evangelical reading can be at once theologically informed and pastorally usable without surrendering the rigor of grammatical and historical attention.

Across these works Harmon’s constructive contributions cohere into a set of doctrinal loci that are exegetically driven yet systemically suggestive. In **hamartiology**, sin is exile from God’s presence and rule, a disordering of vocation into idolatry and injustice; in **soteriology**, salvation is restoration through the **new exodus** accomplished by the **Servant** who bears the curse, liberates from enslaving powers, and inaugurates **new creation**. In **Christology**, the Son’s **incarnation** is the assumption of **servant** form, his **obedience** is vicarious and representative, and his **exaltation** grounds the universal confession of Jesus as **Lord**. In **ecclesiology**, the church is the **servant people**, a community of **elect exiles** whose life is cruciform, sacramental in witness, and oriented to the nations. In **eschatology**, the already-not yet of **kingdom** frames ethics and mission, and the final **new heavens and new earth** is the consummated restoration of presence. These doctrinal patterns signal the imprint of **Vosian** redemptive-historical sensibility while maintaining Harmon’s attention to the shape of particular texts.

Harmon’s engagement with conversation partners shows both receptivity and principled disagreement. With **N. T. Wright**, he shares the instinct that exile language captures genuine Second Temple anxieties, yet he resists letting exile be the single master metaphor, guarding **justification** and **atonement** from reduction to national restoration. With **Richard B. Hays**, he values the detection of **echoes** but keeps the gate fairly narrow, insisting on lexical, thematic, and contextual convergence, thereby maintaining **authorial intent** and avoiding eisegetical figuration. With **G. K. Beale**, he embraces the **temple** and **new creation** trajectories and celebrates **inaugurated eschatology**, yet he avoids complex typological chains that are not textually constrained. And relative to **canonical criticism** in the line of **Brevard Childs**, he accepts canonical shape as a hermeneutical given but insists that the canon’s theological pressure never negates the referential histories of **Israel** and the **church**.

Two features of Harmon’s corpus are particularly helpful for systematic reflection. First, his coordination of **Servant identity** with **union with Christ** provides a bridge between dogmatic **Christology** and ethics, allowing the shape of the Son’s obedience to norm the church’s life without collapsing the distinction between **unio personarum** and **imitatio Christi**. Second, his exile-restoration frame integrates **creation**, **covenant**, and **kingdom** in a way that preserves a holistic soteriology: reconciliation to God, renewal of vocation, and reconstitution of community. These features invite further development in **sacramentology** and **public theology**, as the pilgrim-servant people live as a foretaste of the coming **new creation** while bearing witness in word and deed.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary perspective, Harmon’s work is a welcome contribution to **redemptive-historical** biblical theology, broadly consonant with **Westminster** commitments to **Scripture’s authority**, **covenant unity**, and a **Christ-centered** reading of the canon. Several tensions warrant principled clarification. First, the powerful **exile-restoration** motif should be set under classical **federal theology**, such that exile is explicated by the broken **covenant of works** with Adam and restoration by the **covenant of grace**, guarding the forensic core of **justification by faith** from being subsumed under national or relational categories. Second, while Harmon’s typology is generally restrained, explicit appeals to **analogia fidei** and a careful account of **sensus plenior** would strengthen hermeneutical controls, ensuring that divine authorship does not license decontextualized figuration. Third, in delineating the **Servant** people, he should protect **Israel-church** relations from either supersessionist flattening or dual-covenant bifurcation by rooting continuity and discontinuity in **Christ’s mediatorial offices** and the expansion of the **covenant of grace** to the nations. Finally, Harmon’s stress on **union with Christ** and cruciform **discipleship** would benefit from clarifying the **law-gospel** distinction in sanctification, so that imperatives are explicitly grounded in and distinguished from the justifying indicatives. With these calibrations, Harmon’s corpus aligns strongly with classical **Reformed** orthodoxy and serves the church by teaching it to read the Scriptures as one coherent story fulfilled in **Christ the Servant**.
