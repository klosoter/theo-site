### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The Israeli historian **Yuval Noah Harari**, born 1976, trained at the **Hebrew University of Jerusalem** and completed a DPhil at **Oxford** in 2002, rose from medieval military history to global prominence as a theorist of **Big History** who narrates the human story from the **cognitive revolution** to **Dataism**. His method weds **evolutionary theory** and **economic history** with a sociological account of **imagined orders**, presenting religion, money, law, and human rights as intersubjective fictions that enable large-scale cooperation. Harari openly adopts a **naturalist** frame that privileges the explanatory authority of **biochemistry** and **algorithmic information processing**, often phrased in the provocative maxim that **organisms are algorithms**. Alongside this scientistic rhetoric, he draws deeply from **Buddhist** practice, especially **Vipassana** and the doctrine of **no-self**, or *anatta*, which he deploys to critique **liberal humanism** and the metaphysical solidity of the **self**. The resulting picture is synthetic and polemical, moving between sober historiography and quasi-prophetic warnings about **AI** and **biotech** that echo both **Weber’s** disenchantment thesis and **Foucault’s** power-knowledge analysis.

Harari is a public intellectual whose classroom has become the global stage, and his voice joins contemporaries like **Jared Diamond**, **Richard Dawkins**, and **Daniel Dennett** in arguing that **evolution** and **culture** mutually construct the human world. He insists on a strong distinction between **objective realities** like rivers and viruses, **subjective realities** like pain or joy, and crucially **intersubjective realities** like corporations, nations, and gods, which depend on shared belief yet have real causal force. This tripartite ontology underwrites his reading of **religion**, **law**, and **economy** as mythic architectures that structure human cooperation. It also funds his claim that new intersubjective formations such as **Dataism** may displace **liberal humanism**, not because they are truer, but because they mobilize cooperation and prediction more efficiently under conditions of **algorithmic governance**.

#### 2. Sapiens and the architecture of imagined orders
In **Sapiens** 2011 Hebrew, 2014 English, Harari narrates the ascent of Homo sapiens through four revolutions, the **cognitive** about 70,000 years ago, the **agricultural** about 12,000 years ago, the **unification of humankind** across empires and markets, and the **scientific** beginning in the sixteenth century. The fulcrum is the capacity for **fiction** and **myth**, or what he calls **imagined orders**, which enable cooperation among vast numbers of strangers via shared stories about **money**, **nations**, **human rights**, and **gods**. These orders are neither mere lies nor metaphysical realities; they are **intersubjective** frameworks that shape incentives, legitimize institutions, and coordinate action, much as **Benedict Anderson’s** imagined communities forge national belonging. Harari positions **religion** as one genre of imagined order that supplies overarching meaning and behavioral norms, alongside **law** and **market** regimes that function similarly though with secular grammars.

The narrative of **Sapiens** is as much diagnosis as history. Harari argues that the **agricultural revolution** often reduced individual well-being even as it increased population, that the **scientific revolution** catalyzed unprecedented power at the cost of intensified exploitation, and that the modern **liberal package** liberty, rights, and individual choice rests on fragile stories about **selfhood** and **dignity** that lack biological foundation. At every turn the engine is the human talent for **collective myth-making**, which can be emancipatory or catastrophic. Religion is explained rather than adjudicated; **Christianity** and **Islam** are assessed for their imperial scalability, syncretic flexibility, and regulatory capacity within global systems. The theologian’s categories are transposed into a sociological key: **soteriology** becomes population resilience, **covenant** becomes institutional trust, and **eschatology** becomes the open-ended project of technological mastery.

#### 3. Homo Deus and secular eschatologies
With **Homo Deus** 2015 Hebrew, 2016 English, Harari shifts from retrospective synthesis to prospective prognosis. The work poses a secular **eschatology** in which the dominant human quests become **immortality**, **happiness**, and **divinity**, pursued through **biotechnology**, **neuroengineering**, and **AI**. The pivotal thesis is the decoupling of **intelligence** from **consciousness**, which undermines **liberal humanism** that locates value in conscious experience. If non-conscious algorithms outperform humans in cognition, then political authority and economic value will migrate from persons to **data flows**. The cresting creed is **Dataism**, a faith in the free circulation of information as the highest good, which treats organisms as **data-processing systems** and moralizes the maximization of **information throughput**.

Harari’s three paths for the future are **techno-humanism**, which seeks to upgrade humans into gods, **Dataism**, which subordinates human judgment to algorithmic prediction, and a diminished **liberal humanism** that clings to fading myths of **free will** and **authenticity**. He is skeptical of robust **free will**, invoking **neuroscience** and behavioral economics to argue that choice is largely an epiphenomenon of biochemical and computational processes. The tone is cautionary yet speculative, blending **Weberian** rationalization with **Nietzschean** transvaluation, as values migrate from the sanctity of persons to the efficiency of systems. The resulting secular **eschaton** is not a final state but an accelerating asymmetry between human meaning and machine optimization.

#### 4. 21 Lessons and public ethics in the algorithmic age
In **21 Lessons for the 21st Century** 2018, Harari pivots to practical counsel about **politics**, **education**, **work**, and **meaning** under disruptive technologies. He discusses **nationalism** and **globalism**, **terrorism** and **immigration**, **post-truth** media and **surveillance capitalism**, urging humility, **critical thinking**, and **emotional intelligence** as adaptive virtues. His central warning is the rise of **digital dictatorships** that leverage data to predict and manipulate behavior, eroding the **liberal** premise of autonomous citizens. The remedy he commends includes civic education, institutional safeguards, and a disciplined interiority fostered by **mindfulness** and **Buddhist** insight into the flux of mental events.

Harari’s ethic is pragmatic, not deontological. **Human rights** are treated as powerful fictions that deserve protection because they coordinate cooperation and mitigate suffering, not because they correspond to an **imago Dei** or to **natural law**. The counsel to individuals is to know themselves before the algorithms know them better, though he insists that the **self** is a narrative construction susceptible to predictive deconstruction. The counsel to nations is to pursue global cooperation against global threats, especially **nuclear proliferation**, **climate change**, and **technological disruption**. The moral vocabulary is consequentialist and managerial, yet it is carried by a consistently demythologizing impulse toward religious and nationalist stories.

#### 5. Religion, myth, and the reclassification of faiths
Harari defines **religion** as a system of human norms and values that claims legitimacy from a superhuman order. This allows him to classify **liberalism**, **communism**, and **Nazism** as religions, since each posits a transpersonal standard that adjudicates human conduct. Within this typology he distinguishes **theist religions** that appeal to gods from **natural-law religions** that appeal to laws of nature, the latter including modern scientific creeds. The important move is to relocate **Christianity**, **Islam**, and **Buddhism** within a broader ecology of **imagined orders**, where their explanatory power lies in underwriting large-scale cooperation rather than in mediating **revelation** or grounding objective metaphysics. He praises **Buddhism** for its analytical psychology and its non-theistic path to alleviating suffering, while he critiques **Christian** and **Islamic** claims as historically adaptive narratives with diminishing predictive utility under **Dataism**.

This reclassification is deliberately reductive in service of comparative analysis. The doctrines of **creation**, **providence**, and **grace** become tools for organizing labor, disciplining desire, and legitimating power. Harari is aware of internal critiques within traditions, such as prophetic denunciations of idolatry in the **Hebrew Bible** or the **Augustinian** exposure of disordered loves, but he appropriates them functionally. The grand confessional claims about **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **sacrament** register, in his frame, as symbols that mark identities and motivate trust rather than as disclosures of divine reality. He thus places **religion** under the same analytic as **money** and **states**, a move that clarifies the institutional dynamics of faith while truncating its metaphysical reach.

#### 6. Philosophical underpinnings and interlocutors
Harari stands at the intersection of **Darwinian** naturalism, **Dawkinsian** meme theory, **Dennett’s** account of competence without comprehension, and **Foucault’s** insight that knowledge and power co-produce social orders. He inherits from **Weber** the story of disenchantment and bureaucratic rationalization and from **Benedict Anderson** the idea that nations are **imagined communities**. From **Buddhist** *anatta* he draws the conclusion that the **self** lacks substantial essence, a judgment he correlates with neuroscientific accounts of the brain as a bundle of modules and with the cybernetic image of the organism as an algorithm. The epistemic stance is a mix of **constructivism** about meaning and **scientism** about mechanism. Meaning is intersubjective and negotiable; mechanism is objective and calculable.

This dualism yields tensions that fuel both his appeal and his critics. He denies **teleology** yet often narrates the **scientific revolution** as a structural break that reorganizes **truth**, **power**, and **wealth** toward greater predictive control. He rejects **metaphysics** yet implies normative hierarchies among **imagined orders**, judging some as more adaptive or humane than others. He dismisses **free will** but exhorts readers to cultivate liberty from algorithmic manipulation. The method is genealogical and forensic, which places him in conversation with **Nietzsche** as well as with **Habermas**, though his tone is less juridical than aphoristic. These philosophical strands feed his signature theses about **intelligence versus consciousness** and about the impending dominance of **Dataism**.

#### 7. Historiography, scale, and criticism
As historian, Harari practices **macrohistory**, trading archival micro-precision for civilizational scope and narrative clarity. He compresses continents and millennia into crisp theses about the **cognitive revolution** and the **unification of humankind**. Critics note that this scale invites overstatement, selective anecdote, and a flattening of scholarly debates, especially regarding **indigenous histories**, **colonialism**, and the moral economies of **religion**. Yet his synthesis serves a pedagogical aim: to expose how **imagined orders** bind strangers into systems larger than any individual. The contrasts with specialized historiography recall the tension between **grand theory** and **thick description**, a tension he resolves pragmatically in favor of public philosophy.

The pragmatic tilt invites accusations of **teleology** disguised as anti-teleology, of **Eurocentrism** despite global scope, and of **presentism** in reading the past through **AI** and **biotech** futures. Harari answers by insisting that the point is not historical finality but existential alertness to new **algorithmic** rationalities. He reads the past to equip the present for choices under unprecedented conditions, not to vindicate a deterministic narrative. The most potent criticisms concede the descriptive brilliance of **imagined orders** yet resist the reduction of truth to **intersubjective utility**, arguing that such reduction undermines the very moral claims Harari seeks to preserve against **digital authoritarianism**.

#### 8. Ethics, politics, and the specter of Dataism
The heart of Harari’s political ethic is a suspicion that **liberal humanism** lacks the intellectual resources to withstand **Dataism**. Liberalism reveres the **self** as the locus of meaning and authority, yet algorithms trained on behavioral data will know the self better than it knows itself. Once **intelligence** is decoupled from **consciousness**, market and state actors can make more accurate predictions without consulting human subjectivity. The result is a crisis of **democracy**, which presupposes deliberative agents, and of **markets**, which presuppose informed consumers. Harari anticipates a stratification between enhanced elites and a **useless class** displaced by **automation**, producing new hierarchies legitimated by data rather than by blood or property.

Against this trajectory he proposes modest guardrails. Educate for **critical thinking**, **communication**, **collaboration**, and **creativity**, often called the four Cs. Cultivate **mindfulness** to witness the play of desires and the constructed character of the **self**, thereby resisting manipulative design. Regulate **data ownership** and **privacy**, coordinate **global governance** to meet global problems, and treat **AI** development with the gravity once reserved for nuclear policy. These proposals keep faith with the humanitarian side of **liberalism** while admitting that its metaphysical engines are sputtering. The unspoken wager is that **intersubjective** repairs can postpone surrender to **Dataism** even if they cannot finally refute it.

#### 9. Theology by negation: engaging Christian categories
Harari’s project functions as negative theology for **Christian** thought by locating core doctrines within his triad of **objective**, **subjective**, and **intersubjective** realities. The **imago Dei** becomes a noble story that coordinates respect and dignity, yet lacks purchase in biochemical description. **Providence** becomes historical contingency canalized by emergent orders rather than the wise rule of a personal God. **Sin** becomes evolutionary mismatch and institutional path dependence, while **idolatry** is redescribed as attaching ultimate value to any **imagined order** including **Dataism**. The **soul** dissolves into neurocognitive processes, resonating with **Buddhist** *anatta* and with the secular eclipse of **substance** metaphysics. The **incarnation** and **resurrection** are treated as paradigmatic myths with civilizational impact rather than as events in God’s economy of **salvation**.

At the same time, Harari inadvertently illumines how **covenant**, **sacrament**, and **church** generate durable **intersubjective** matrices that outlast many secular institutions. His lens helps theology see the institutional genius of **religion**, how rituals encode trust and how narratives foster solidarity. His warnings about **digital idolatry** echo prophetic critiques of **Mammon** and **Baal**, though he grounds them in systemic risk rather than in **revelation**. He thus invites a theological response that neither denies the social constructedness of human orders nor concedes that constructedness exhausts their truth.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and WTS vantage, Harari’s strengths lie in his lucid exposure of **idolatry** in modern guises, especially **Dataism**, and in his sober warnings about **algorithmic** power that threatens embodied moral agency. His analysis of **imagined orders** can be read through **common grace** as a description of the created human capacity for **culture-making** and covenantal coordination, albeit fallen and prone to **antithesis**. Yet the foundational claims of his project conflict with **Reformed** commitments at decisive points. By collapsing **revelation** into **intersubjective** utility, he rejects the self-attesting authority of the **Word** and the **Creator-creature distinction** that anchors metaphysical realism. By denying **teleology**, he forecloses the **providence** and *telos* of **creation-fall-redemption**, reducing history to contingent evolution and strategic narrative. By treating the **self** as a bundle without enduring identity, he undermines **imago Dei** and the moral coherence of **covenant** responsibility. By dissolving **human rights** into useful fictions, he jeopardizes their non-negotiable status that **Reformed** thinkers ground in creation and in **natural law** ordered to Scripture.

A **Reformed** alternative affirms that human cooperative orders are indeed symbolically mediated, yet their truth is finally indexed to **God’s speech** rather than to collective assent. The **imago Dei** secures irreducible personal dignity against both **biochemical reduction** and **algorithmic** profiling, while **providence** asserts that history is not merely adaptive drift but a theater of **redemption** under the risen **Christ**. The critique of **Dataism** gains force when cast as **idolatry**, a rival liturgy that absolutizes **information** and demands sacrifice, to which the church opposes the **gospel** of grace and the sanctity of persons as covenantal agents. Compatibilist accounts of freedom within **divine sovereignty** can answer Harari’s determinism without romanticizing autonomy, and **catholic** doctrines of the **soul** and resurrection ground hope that outlasts techno-humanist dreams of upgrade. Harari’s insights sharpen Christian prudence about **AI** and **biotech**, but only a theologically thick account of **revelation**, **creation**, and **covenant** can finally resist the slide from **imagined orders** to **data-worship**.
