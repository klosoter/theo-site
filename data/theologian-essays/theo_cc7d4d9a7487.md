### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, conversion, and setting
Tertullian of **Carthage**, born around 155 and active until after 220, stands at the fountainhead of **Latin theology** where Roman forensic culture met biblical proclamation. Trained in **rhetoric and law**, he wrote with a pleader’s bite and a jurist’s precision, recasting Christian claims in the idiom of **substantia**, **persona**, and **status** long before conciliar codification. His North African milieu was marked by civic spectacle, imperial cult, and intermittent persecution under the **Severan emperors**, producing a spirituality of **martyrdom** and an ethic of separation from **idolatry**. His conversion around 195 launched a literary burst that he himself interpreted as the soul’s confession, the **anima naturaliter christiana**, recognizing the Creator under the pressure of conscience and history. This is also the moment he famously sharpened the contrast between **Athens and Jerusalem**, a slogan lodged in **De Praescriptione** that rebukes pretentious curiosity while signaling his own continuing, critical use of **Stoic physics** and **legal analogy**.

#### 2. Method: regula fidei and praescriptio
Tertullian’s method is best captured by two juridical axioms, the **regula fidei** and the **praescriptio**. The **regula fidei** was a concise summary of apostolic teaching used for catechesis and baptism, narrating the **Monarchia Dei**, the **Christus Jesus** who is both **Dei Filius** and **homo verus**, the **passion and resurrection**, the sending of the **Spiritus Sanctus**, the **ecclesia**, and the resurrection of the flesh. In **De Praescriptione Haereticorum**, he argues that this rule creates a legal bar or **praescriptio** against heretic litigants. Heretics lack standing because Scripture belongs to the **apostolic churches** that received it, preserved it, and confess it according to the rule. The canon of truth is public, ancient, and universal, not a property of esoteric schools. Thus he rebukes **Gnostic** exegesis not primarily by textual finesse but by contesting the forum and the burden of proof. Scripture is authoritative, but it is read within the Church’s **traditio** and under the **regula fidei**, a posture that both anticipates creedal consolidation and guards against the privatization of revelation. The result is an anti-gnostic hermeneutic grounded in **apostolicity**, **catholicity**, and the clarity of the **kerygma**.

#### 3. Apology and ethics: public witness under empire
The early corpus, notably **Apologeticum 197** and **Ad Nationes 197**, crafts a public defense that blends **natural law**, civic argument, and biblical confession. He ridicules the inconsistency of magistrates who condemn **Christians** absent crimes, calls for **due process**, and in a famous flourish celebrates the paradox that the **blood of martyrs is seed**, the **sanguis martyrum semen** that germinates social renewal. He insists on the christian **sacramentum**, an oath of allegiance to Christ above Caesar, an image that underwrites his ecclesial discipline and later penitential strictures. Ethical treatises like **De Spectaculis** and **De Idololatria** forbid attendance at the games and participation in trades aligned to **idolatry**, insisting on the Church’s **holiness** in a polluted economy. **De Corona** stages a confrontation over military honors and crowns, while **Scorpiace** arms confessors against **apostasy**. In these works, Tertullian articulates a rigorous **discipline of separation** anchored in the jealous sovereignty of the one **Deus** and the lordship of **Christus**, a discipline that becomes sharper during his **Montanist** phase but already governs his legal imagination.

#### 4. Anti-heretical polemic: creation, incarnation, and Scripture
Tertullian prosecuted heresy case by case. In **Adversus Marcionem 207 to 212**, five books dismantle **Marcion’s** dualism and truncated canon, defending the **Old Testament** as the promise now fulfilled in **Christus** and asserting the Creator’s **bonitas** and **justitia** within a single **oeconomia** of salvation. Against **Hermogenes** in **Adversus Hermogenem**, he defends **creatio ex nihilo**, rejecting eternally preexistent matter and reaffirming divine **omnipotence** and **simplicity**. Against **Valentinian** schemes, he repudiates mythic emanations and urges the **regula fidei** as boundary. Two doctrinal monographs, **De Carne Christi** and **De Resurrectione Carnis**, answer **Docetism** by insisting on the real **caro Christi** and the future resurrection of the same **flesh**. His famous taunt to the docetic scandal, **credibile quia ineptum, certum est quia impossibile**, is a rhetorically pointed, not irrationalist, insistence that the **cross** overturns worldly criteria of plausibility. Scripture remains his evidentiary core, yet it is marshaled with **juridical** rigor, a sentencing brief against the speculative frivolities of the schools.

#### 5. Trinity and Christology: trinitas and una substantia tres personae
If Tertullian is father of **Latin trinitarianism**, it is through **Adversus Praxean 213 to 216**, where he rejects **modalism** and protects the **monarchia** of God through a carefully staged **oeconomia**. He coins or consolidates the language of **trinitas**, teaching that God is **una substantia tres personae**, one substance three persons. He deploys prosopological exegesis of Scripture, distinguishing speakers and addressees so that the **Pater**, **Filius**, and **Spiritus** appear in the economy without dividing the unity. The **Logos** is eternal as **ratio** within God and becomes **sermo** when protracted for creation, a **prolatio** like a ray from the sun, which can extend without severing the source. He insists, therefore, on a unity of **substantia** and a distinction of **personae**. Yet he also entertains a taxis that often reads as **subordinationism**, speaking of the Son as deriving from the Father for economy and of the **Spirit** proceeding **a Patre per Filium**, from the Father through the Son. He had no Nicene **homoousios** and vacillates on the language of eternal **filiation**, at times implying that the Son’s **persona** is manifested with the economy. Nevertheless, the anti-modalist grammar, **tres personae in una substantia**, becomes the seed of later **Nicene** and **pro-Nicene** dogma, a creative Latin relocation of Greek biblical metaphysics.

#### 6. Anthropology and the soul: De Anima and natural knowledge
In **De Anima 210**, Tertullian proposes a striking **traducianism**, the **tradux animae**, teaching that the soul is propagated along with the body from the parents. He argues the soul is a subtle **corpus**, since for him nothing truly exists that is not somehow body, a **Stoic** inheritance retooled for biblical anthropology. This conviction underwrites his defense of the **resurrection of the flesh**, since a corporeal soul can cohere with a transformed body under divine sovereignty. His famous appeal to the **testimonium animae**, the soul’s natural confession that God exists and that judgment weighs upon conscience, furnishes a proto **sensus divinitatis** that both critiques pagan worship and legitimates a universal moral knowledge. He sketches a moral psychology of **passions**, **demonology**, and **temptation**, and rehearses the Adamic transmission of **sin** without fully articulating **original guilt** in Augustinian terms. The anthropological architecture is medicinal, juridical, and ascetical, curing a compromised nature through **discipline**, **repentance**, and the **grace** vested in Christ.

#### 7. Church and sacraments: baptism, penance, and Eucharistic realism
Tertullian’s ecclesial doctrine arises in controversy and catechesis. In **De Baptismo 198 to 203**, he defends baptismal **regeneration**, spiritual **signaculum**, and **triple immersion**, while counseling delay for **infant baptism** in non-urgent cases due to the seriousness of post-baptismal **sins** and the obligations of **sponsors**. The caution is pastoral rigor, not a denial of baptism’s grace, and it points to his view of ecclesial **discipline**. In **De Paenitentia 203**, he describes **exomologesis**, the public confession and penitential regimen granted once after baptism for grave sins, a second plank after the shipwreck. Later, in **De Pudicitia 213 to 220**, within his **Montanist** turn, he denies episcopal power to remit certain **mortal sins**, castigating the Roman bishop as **episcopus episcoporum** and **pontifex maximus** and asserting the **Paraclete’s** stricter rule. He speaks of the **Eucharist** as the **corpus Christi** and uses robust sacrificial and real-presence idiom without philosophical elaboration, lodging the mystery in the Church’s prayer and **discipline**. Ecclesiology is simultaneously **charismatic** and **juridical**, grounded in apostolic succession of faith and the present **Spirit**, with the balance shifting as his rigor hardens.

#### 8. The Montanist turn: prophecy, asceticism, and eschatology
Around 206, Tertullian aligns with **Montanus**, **Priscilla**, and **Maximilla**, the **New Prophecy** that claimed the **Paraclete** was bringing eschatological discipline to the Church. Works like **De Monogamia**, **De Exhortatione Castitatis**, **De Jejuniis**, and **De Pudicitia** intensify his advocacy of **asceticism**, **fasting**, and inviolate **monogamy**, mounting a sustained critique of what he saw as episcopal laxity toward wealth, remarriage, and post-baptismal **absolution**. He advocates new oracles judged by their agreement with the **regula fidei** but authoritative for discipline, thereby stretching the relation between **Scripture** and **prophecy**. His eschatology leans urgent and apocalyptic, rendering martyrdom a privileged **baptism of blood** and stylistically heightening the rhetoric of separation. The **Tertullianists** persisted in Carthage into the fourth century, though **Augustine** later reports their reconciliation with the **catholic Church**. The legacy of this period leaves a deep imprint on Latin **penitential** systems and debates on **authority**, even as later orthodoxy pruned its excesses.

#### 9. Style, language, and transmission: father of Latin theology
Tertullian’s greatest enduring contribution is linguistic and conceptual. He naturalized **Greek theology** into **Latin law** and everyday speech, bequeathing the terms **trinitas**, **substantia**, **persona**, and **sacramentum** to the Church’s dogmatic register. He supplied juridical analogies suited for **creedal** and **conciliar** precision, and he elevated the **regula fidei** as a doctrinal spine that could be recited, scrutinized, and defended. His rhetorical aphorisms, from **Athens versus Jerusalem** to **sanguis martyrum semen**, continued to shape Christian polemic and piety. **Cyprian of Carthage** called him master, copied his discipline, and moralized his rigor, while **Augustine** mined his anti-heretical method and corrected his theological imbalances in favor of **grace** and **catholic unity**. Even where later theology rejected elements of his **Stoic corporealism** or **Montanist prophecy**, it retained his constructive grammar and strategies of **anti-gnostic** resistance. The **Latin West** learned to speak dogma in his cadence.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed evaluation honors Tertullian’s **regula fidei**, **Scripture’s supremacy**, and proto **sensus divinitatis** while rejecting his **Montanist** appeal to ongoing revelatory authority and his late **rigorism** that fences grace. His insistence that heresy lacks standing apart from the **apostolic churches** resonates with **sola Scriptura** as Scripture read in the **communio sanctorum**, though the Reformed sharpen Scripture’s self-authenticating clarity through the **internal testimony of the Spirit** rather than through a juridical **praescriptio** tied to specific sees. His **trinitas** formula, **una substantia tres personae**, is a precious bequest that the Reformed receive through **Nicene** and **pro-Nicene** development, yet his hints of **subordinationism** and the temporalizing of **filiation** must be corrected by **eternal generation**, **consubstantiality**, and the full **aseity of the Son** as clarified in classical orthodoxy. His **natural knowledge** thesis, the **anima naturaliter christiana**, anticipates **Calvin’s sensus divinitatis** but requires completion by a doctrine of **total depravity** and the **noetic effects of sin** to explain suppression of truth. His **penitential** program valorizes church **discipline**, something the **Reformed** embrace under **keys of the kingdom**, yet his denial of gospel restoration for grievous sinners contradicts the **free justification** and **definitive forgiveness** promised in the **covenant of grace**. His caution regarding **infant baptism** diverges from **Reformed covenantal baptism**, which locates the sign in God’s **promise** rather than in the subject’s readiness. Finally, his occasional **Stoic corporealism** in **De Anima** is a metaphysical overreach set right by **divine spirituality** and **simplicity**, while his hermeneutic vigilance against **Gnostic privatization** remains salutary. In sum, a Reformed and Westminster reception receives Tertullian’s **anti-gnostic rule**, **trinitarian lexicon**, and **martyr ecclesiology** while confessing the **sufficiency of Scripture**, the **catholic Nicene Trinity**, and a **grace-shaped discipline** within the **covenantal** economy.
