### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the problem of authority
William J. Abraham emerged from the contested religious landscape of late twentieth-century **Methodism** to address the elemental question of **authority in doctrine and practice**. Born in 1947 in Ireland and educated in **Belfast** and **Oxford**, he absorbed the virtues of **analytic philosophy** under figures like **Basil Mitchell** while remaining loyal to the **Wesleyan** vision of **evangelical holiness** and **means of grace**. His long tenure at **Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University** positioned him at the center of the **United Methodist Church** debates over **doctrinal identity**, **ecclesial discipline**, and **moral theology** that intensified from the 1980s to the 2010s. Against the background of **Enlightenment foundationalism**, **postliberal expressivism**, and a mainline drift toward **procedural minimalism**, Abraham framed a constructive project whose burden was both epistemic and ecclesial: to render **divine revelation** in thick, sacramental terms and to recalibrate **warrant** for Christian belief by recovering the church’s **canonical heritage**. The problem he consistently diagnosed was what he famously called **doctrinal amnesia**, an institutional forgetfulness about the content and instruments of **apostolic faith** that rendered Methodist identity thin, pragmatic, and vulnerable.

Abraham’s context matters because it shaped his refusal of both **liberal Protestant historicism** and **narrow biblicism**. He viewed the former as anti-realist about **God’s speech and deeds**, collapsing **revelation** into community experience, and the latter as insufficiently attentive to the Spirit’s plenary **economy of grace** beyond textual propositions. Here the formative influences of **John Wesley’s** ordered practices and of **Thomistic** metaphysical clarity are visible, alongside conversation partners in **analytic philosophy** like **Alvin Plantinga** who articulated **epistemic externalism** about religious belief. Abraham’s basic wager was that the **Holy Spirit** has bequeathed a stable but living **canon** of materials for the church’s life, and that this canonical complex, not an abstract **criterion** invented by modern theory, properly mediates revelation and confers **warrant**.

#### 2. Method: canonical theism and epistemic externalism
Abraham’s methodological hallmark is **canonical theism**, a proposal to relocate **epistemology** inside the church’s God-given **canon** of **Scripture**, **creeds**, **liturgy**, **sacraments**, **episkope**, **saints**, **icons**, **ascetical disciplines**, and **doctrinal formulas**. In his magna methodologica, **Canon and Criterion in Christian Theology** 1998, he argued that the early church did not possess a single external **criterion** against which all claims were measured. Instead, the church received and recognized a suite of **canons** that functioned as **means of grace** through which the Triune God formed and authenticated the community. The modern project of locating a neutral **Archimedean point**, whether **reason**, **religious experience**, or **Scripture-alone** severed from ecclesial practice, was judged both historically inaccurate and theologically corrosive. Abraham’s move here is more than historical description; it is a metaphysical and epistemic claim that **divine action** through canonical media is the primary conferrer of **warrant**.

In conversation with **Reformed epistemology** and **Plantinga’s** notion of **proper function**, Abraham pressed an **externalist** account of **warrant** in **Crossing the Threshold of Divine Revelation** 2006. One does not secure revelation by first meeting independent epistemic criteria. Rather, one is inducted across a threshold into the **canonical heritage**, where the Spirit’s **testimonium** and the church’s **habitus** reshape cognitive and affective faculties. This is not fideism. Abraham’s realism retains **public reasons**, engages historical inquiry, and welcomes **philosophical analysis**, yet it denies that such tools can function as the church’s **criterion**. The operative image is sacramental: the **Spirit** uses identifiable instruments to unite believers to the **Christus** and to the **communio sanctorum**, and these instruments carry with them their own modes of **recognition**, **testing**, and **extension**.

#### 3. Evangelism, catechesis, and the cure of souls
From **The Logic of Evangelism** 1989 to **Waking from Doctrinal Amnesia** 1995, Abraham contended that **evangelism** is not marketing but **cure of souls** ordered to **conversion**, **baptism**, **catechesis**, and **sanctification**. He drew deeply on **Wesley’s means of grace** and the Methodist class-meeting tradition to argue that doctrinal instruction and disciplined practices are intrinsic to the church’s mission. The thin pragmatism of much late modern **Methodism**, he charged, surrendered **holiness** and **doctrinal truth** to bureaucratic consensus. By contrast, a **canonical theist** evangelism inducts converts into a comprehensive **way of life**, including **creedal confession**, **sacramental participation**, and **ascetical disciplines**, as well as the hope for **entire sanctification**. Evangelism in this register depends on and renews the **canon** rather than replacing it with spiritual consumerism.

This pastoral-theological line dovetailed with Abraham’s broader theory of **divine action**. Evangelism is efficacious because the **Triune God** acts through **canonical means**, not because human persuasion alone succeeds. The **Word preached**, the **water of baptism**, and the **Eucharistic anamnesis** are not merely expressive symbols. They are sites of **causal contact** where **divine agency** grants new birth, sustains faith, and advances **theosis**. Thus his call to heal **doctrinal amnesia** functioned as a summons to recover the causal density of the church’s **sacramental economy** and to renounce the procedural reductionisms of modern **ecclesial polity**.

#### 4. Canon, criterion, and the patristic settlement
In **Canon and Criterion** 1998, Abraham delivered his most significant historical-theological claim about the **patristic settlement**. He read the consolidation of **Scripture**, **creeds** such as **Nicaea** and **Chalcedon**, **liturgy**, and **episcopacy** as a Spirit-led complex that determined the range of **orthodox** possibility. Contrary to versions of **sola Scriptura** that treat the Bible as a freestanding epistemic **criterion**, Abraham argued that patristic Christianity never deployed Scripture in isolation. The biblical canon was recognized within a matrix of **rule of faith**, **baptismal confession**, and **conciliar discernment**, and was read within the habitus of **prayer** and **sacramental practice**. The upshot is not to subordinate **Scripture** but to embed it within the **canonical network** that enables the church to hear **God’s voice** rightly.

Abraham sharpened this thesis by disputing both **Lindbeck’s postliberalism** and **Barth’s revelational Christocentrism**. Against **Lindbeck**, he insisted on **theological realism** and **divine agency**, warning that cultural-linguistic models can mute claims about **God’s acts ad extra**. Against **Barth**, he stressed the plurality of Spirit-given **media** beyond the event of **Christ’s self-revelation** in preaching, highlighting the ecclesially given **instruments** specified by **Wesleyan** and **patristic** tradition. The positive proposal, formalized in the edited volume **Canonical Theism** 2008 with **Jason Vickers** and **Natalie Van Kirk**, urged churches to retrieve not only **confessions** but also **spiritual disciplines**, **iconic practices**, and **orders of ministry** as canonical resources for truth and holiness.

#### 5. Wesley, Athens, and analytic clarity
In **Aldersgate and Athens** 2010, Abraham staged a dialogue between **John Wesley’s** revivalist and ascetical genius and the **Athenian** virtues of **analytic philosophy**. The argument was twofold. First, **Wesley** operated with a de facto **canonical theism**, deploying **Scripture**, **creed**, **liturgy**, **hymnody**, **spiritual direction**, and **discipline** as a comprehensive pedagogy of **grace**. Second, the contemporary **Wesleyan** academy requires the clarity of **analytic distinctions** about **rationality**, **warrant**, **defeaters**, and **testimony** to resist the drift into amorphous experience-talk. Abraham pressed **epistemic externalism** again: entry into the **canonical form of life** rightly orders the cognitive faculties by the Spirit, while defeaters are handled within the same canonical ecology through **doctrinal development**, **pastoral correction**, and **conciliar judgment**.

This work also sharpened Abraham’s account of **entire sanctification** and **prevenient grace**. He defended the **Wesleyan** insistence that **grace** precedes and enables human response yet does not efface **libertarian freedom**. The journey from **initial justification** to **perfect love** is enacted within the **canonical economy** and animated by **divine action**. Here Abraham’s admixture of **Aquinas** on infused **virtues**, **Wesley** on the **means of grace**, and **analytic** care for agency and causation gave his **soteriology** both metaphysical heft and pastoral texture.

#### 6. Divine agency and divine action
Abraham’s final major undertaking was the four-volume **Divine Agency and Divine Action** 2017–2021, which excavates and advances a theologically robust ontology of **causation**, **miracle**, **providence**, and **sacramentality**. The series surveys historical and contemporary debates, dismantles naturalist presuppositions such as the **causal closure of the physical**, and argues for **agent causation** as indispensable to both human responsibility and **God’s free acts**. Abraham contends that the **Triune God** exercises **intentional agency** in ways irreducible to physical processes, but also that such agency regularly and fittingly employs the church’s **canonical media**. Miracles are not violations of laws but expressions of **divine intentionality** embedded within a providential order whose laws are themselves a function of **divine wisdom**.

Within this framework, **sacramental theology** becomes a privileged locus of **divine action**. The **Eucharist**, the **words of absolution**, the **laying on of hands**, and the **reading of Scripture** are all sites in which **God acts** reliably to give what they signify, not mechanically but covenantally. Abraham’s metaphysic is thus thoroughly **soteriological**: the aim of **divine agency** is the formation of **saints**, the sanctification of **time**, and the construction of **holy communities**. His account resists deist and occasionalist extremes, attends to secondary causes, and integrates the **communio sanctorum** as a sphere of cooperative agency under the Spirit.

#### 7. Polemics, reforms, and ecclesial strategy
Abraham’s project was inseparable from his moral and ecclesial polemics. In **Waking from Doctrinal Amnesia** 1995 he diagnosed the **United Methodist Church** as catechetically anemic, governed by proceduralism, and bereft of confidence in **doctrinal authority**. He advocated a **rule of faith** catechesis, renewal of **baptismal vows**, and recovery of **discipline** that would restore **Methodism’s** evangelical and catholic identity. Editing the **Oxford Handbook of Methodist Studies** 2009, he helped frame a global **Methodist** self-understanding attentive to **doctrine**, **liturgy**, **mission**, and **ecumenism**. Late in life he supported ventures like the **Wesley House of Studies** at **Baylor/Truett**, signaling a strategic attention to **formation** and **clergy pipelines** rather than mere policy fights.

Abraham’s ecumenical imagination was conspicuous. His **canonical theism** urged **Methodists** to receive the **patristic and medieval heritage** as their own: **icons**, **ascetical rules**, **saints**, even forms of **episkope** more robust than modern denominational offices. He argued that the **Spirit** did not cease canonical bestowals with the closure of the biblical canon; the **canon** in his usage is broader than **Scripture** without challenging Scripture’s unique role as the Spirit’s normative witness. Critics feared **creeping Romanization**, but Abraham insisted that his model enabled evangelical confidence and doctrinal specificity where thin Protestantism failed. The proposal was not antiquarian. It was an ecclesial strategy for truth, holiness, and mission conducted under the sign of **divine action** through ordered **means of grace**.

#### 8. Suffering, hope, and pastoral wisdom
The personal and pastoral dimensions of Abraham’s theology surface poignantly in **Among the Ashes: On Death, Grief, and Hope** 2017, written in the wake of profound family loss. Here the metaphysic of **divine agency** meets the existential problem of **evil** and the pastoral work of **lament** and **hope**. Abraham refused both cynical naturalism and facile providentialism, articulating a theology of **resurrection**, **divine compassion**, and the **communion of saints** that lends epistemic and moral weight to **canonical practices** such as **lament psalms**, **intercession**, and **Eucharistic remembrance**. The same commitments animating his epistemology reappear: God acts, the **canonical means** are gifts for navigating affliction, and the telos is **holiness** and **beatitude**.

Akin to **Aquinas** on **providence** and **Augustine** on **hope**, Abraham holds together the inscrutability of **divine wisdom** with concrete assurances mediated by **Scripture and sacrament**. Suffering thus becomes a school for **sanctification**, not because God wills evil *per se*, but because **divine agency** bends evil toward **good** within the canonical patterns of **prayer**, **fasting**, and **charity**. The pastoral credibility of his system rests here: metaphysics serves ministry, and **canonical theism** anchors the church amid sorrow.

#### 9. Legacy and influence
Abraham’s legacy lies in reconfiguring the modern debate over **authority** by shifting attention from abstract **criteria** to Spirit-given **canons**. His students and colleagues, including figures like **Jason Vickers**, extended the **canonical theism** project, and his many essays in **analytic theology** helped normalize rigorous **philosophical method** inside the **Wesleyan** guild. The multi-volume **Divine Agency and Divine Action** energized conversations across **analytic philosophy of religion**, **systematics**, and **sacramental theology**, while his pastoral-surgical interventions in **Methodist** life sharpened awareness of **catechesis**, **discipline**, and **mission**. Even critics acknowledge his role in forcing a candid reckoning with **doctrinal authority** and in defying the easy dichotomies of **biblicism vs. liberalism**.

Institutionally, his vision contributed to the formation of new centers of **Wesleyan** theological education and to the emergence of ecclesial realignments culminating in the **Global Methodist Church**. Though Abraham died in 2021 before those realignments matured, his counsel to recover **means of grace**, strengthen **episkope**, and honor the full **canonical heritage** has seeded curricula, catechisms, and pastoral practices across **Methodist** and **Holiness** networks. The trajectory is durable because it links **divine action**, **canonical practices**, and **mission**, offering an identity that is at once evangelical, catholic, and analytically intelligible.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Abraham represents a serious ally and a principled foil. There is robust agreement on **theological realism**, the rejection of **Enlightenment neutrality**, and the centrality of **divine action** against naturalist closure. His **externalist** instincts about **warrant** resonate with a **self-authenticating** account of **revelation** and the **Spirit’s testimonium**. Yet crucial tensions remain. First, his **canonical theism** risks blurring the **principium cognoscendi** of **sola Scriptura** by distributing epistemic authority across **creed, liturgy, saints, and icons**, even when Scripture is given primacy of place. The Reformed alternative is to affirm the church’s **subordinate standards** and **ordinary means of grace** while maintaining that **Scripture alone** norms and judges all canons as the uniquely God-breathed rule. Second, his **Wesleyan synergism** of **prevenient grace** and **libertarian agency** conflicts with **monergistic** **effectual calling** and **irresistible grace**, introducing a soteriological asymmetry that jeopardizes **sola gratia**. Third, the expansion of canonical materials to include **icons** and broader **ascetical canons** jars with the **regulative principle of worship**, which constrains corporate worship to what God commands. Finally, Abraham’s ecclesial strategy leans on the thick **patristic settlement** in ways the Reformed tradition would receive selectively under **covenantal** categories rather than as quasi-canonical extensions. The Reformed commendation is therefore selective: receive Abraham’s vigorous defense of **divine agency**, **catechesis**, and anti-neutral **warrant**, while reforming his **canonical theism** to a Scripture-principled **catholicity**, securing grace’s **monergism**, and ordering the church’s life by the **Word-centered covenant**.
