### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and the interdisciplinary wager
Noreen L. Herzfeld stands at the junction of **computer science** and **systematic theology**, a scholar who has treated **AI** as a probing lens for **theological anthropology**. Educated in both disciplines and long based at the College of Saint Benedict and Saint John’s University in Minnesota, she emerged as a leading voice in the **science‑and‑religion** movement shaped by the **Templeton** nexus and the **Collegeville Institute**. The backdrop is the transformation of computation from the age of **symbolic AI** and **expert systems** to the dominance of **machine learning** and the public prominence of **algorithmic platforms**, alongside the cultural imaginaries of **transhumanism** and **technological salvation**. Herzfeld’s project places **imago Dei** at the center and asks whether our making machines in our image discloses what we think the **image of God** itself is. Her historical moment makes such a question urgent, since the ambitions of **automation** and the rhetoric of **superintelligence** threaten to recast the human as a bundle of functions and data.

The method is resolutely **interdisciplinary**. Herzfeld is neither a theologian sprinkling technical terms over machines nor an engineer baptizing code. Rather she operates through **analogical reasoning**, careful **conceptual analysis**, and a **dialogical** approach that tests claims from **cognitive science** and **philosophy of mind** against **patristic** and **dogmatic** sources. She reads **Turing’s imitation game**, **Searle’s Chinese Room**, and **Weizenbaum’s ELIZA** beside **Augustine on memory**, **Aquinas on intellect and will**, and **Barth on relational imago Dei**. The result is not a synthesis in the older **analogia entis** mode but a disciplined conversation oriented by a theological thesis: persons are constituted by **relation, freedom, and love**, not reducible to **computation**.

#### 2. Key works and the consolidation of a thesis
Herzfeld’s signature book, **In Our Image: Artificial Intelligence and the Human Spirit** 2002, sets the trajectory. Against **functionalist** accounts of the human that equate intelligence with rule‑governed symbol manipulation, she advances a **relational imago Dei** that locates human uniqueness in the capacity for **I‑Thou communion** and **self‑transcending love**. The book offers granular expositions of **AI architectures** and then demonstrates where they fail to capture **embodiment**, **intentionality**, and **moral agency**. The theological center of gravity is the conviction that the **triune God** grounds human personality in **communion** and **gift**, which is why no **algorithmic approximation** of behavior suffices for **personhood**. Here she deploys **Karl Barth’s** reading of Genesis as male‑and‑female in encounter as an image of **divine relationality**, enriched by **Buber’s I‑Thou** and sharpened by **Levinas’** summons of the **face**.

A second major statement, **Technology and Religion: Remaining Human in a Co‑Created World** 2009, extends the argument from anthropology to culture. The phrase **co‑creation** does not blur the **Creator‑creature distinction** but stresses creaturely participation in the **divine mandate** to cultivate and care for creation. Herzfeld draws on **Irenaeus’** vision of historical maturation and on **Catholic sacramentality** to argue that technologies can serve the **common good** when ordered by **virtue**, **justice**, and **caritas**. Yet she warns of **technological idolatry**, where efficiency and control become ersatz absolutes. The book’s chapters on **surveillance**, **digital mediation**, and **biotechnologies** anticipate later debates on **platform power**, **privacy**, and **algorithmic bias**, and they operationalize a theological norm: technology is to be evaluated by how it fosters or frustrates **genuine relation** and **human flourishing** before God.

Between and after these volumes, Herzfeld’s program was sharpened in a series of essays, many in **Zygon**, on **personhood**, **embodiment**, and the **limits of perfection**. A 2006 study on what it means to be human juxtaposed **AI** conceptions of intelligence with **theological accounts** of soul and spirit, pressing beyond the old **substantive imago** defined as rationality toward a **relational‑ethical imago** defined as love and responsibility. Later essays probed **transhumanist eschatologies** influenced by **Kurzweil** and **Bostrom**, identifying their borrowed **salvation motifs** and lack of a grammar for **sin**, **grace**, and **creaturely finitude**. The recurring thesis is that human destiny is not unlimited optimization but **communion**, and that the **telos** of the human is participation in **divine life** through **agape**, not escape into **posthuman** enhancement.

#### 3. Theological anthropology: relational imago Dei and its contours
Herzfeld’s **theological anthropology** is structured by four commitments. First, the **imago Dei** is primarily **relational**. She acknowledges the **substantive** and **functional** traditions but argues that a strictly cognitive or dominion‑centric reading risks legitimating **technocratic mastery**. Drawing from **Barth**, she foregrounds the human as the one who says **Thou** to God and neighbor, an echo of **Trinitarian communion** in the economy of **creation**. Second, the human is **embodied**. Influenced by **phenomenology** and by **Augustine’s** reflections on memory and desire, she resists disembodied accounts of mind that make consciousness an abstract **software** detachable from **hardware**. Embodiment anchors vulnerability, mutual dependence, and the **affective** texture of love, none of which are plausibly coded as mere **information processing**.

Third, **freedom** in Herzfeld’s account is not raw indeterminacy but the capacity for **self‑gift**. She retrieves **Aquinas** on will and **virtue** to insist that free action is teleologically ordered to the **good**, which in Christian grammar is communion with the **triune God**. Fourth, the human is marked by **sin** as inordinate **curiositas** and **superbia**. This gives her critique of technology its theological bite. The problem is not tools but the desire to be as **gods**, a refusal of limits that masquerades as progress. Her shorthand for these interlocking claims is the call to remain **human in a co‑created world**. The phrase binds **mandate** and **limit**, dignity and dependence.

Within this framework, **AI** is theologically significant because it mirrors our own **anthropological assumptions**. If we take the human to be a calculator, then a calculator will seem human‑like. Herzfeld shows how both **symbolic AI** and later **machine learning** enact this mirror by privileging prediction, control, and optimization. She does not deny the utility of prediction in medicine or the justice potential in bias mitigation. Yet she insists that **personhood** requires the hard‑to‑automate realities of **trust**, **promise‑keeping**, and **forgiveness**, realities that arise from being addressed by another in **covenant** and finding oneself answerable before **God**. The **imago** is thus less a property and more a **vocation**, to become who we are through **relation** and **love**.

#### 4. Interlocutors in philosophy of mind and theology
Herzfeld’s dialogical style is evident in sustained engagements with **Turing**, **Searle**, **Dennett**, and **Weizenbaum**. With **Turing**, she grants that behavioral criteria test the sophistication of systems, yet she argues that imitation cannot settle **ontology**. With **Searle**, she finds help in the **Chinese Room** against naïve functionalism, while resisting **biological naturalism** that forecloses **spirit**. With **Dennett**, she disputes the sufficiency of the **intentional stance** for accounting for **first‑person subjectivity** and **moral responsibility**. With **Weizenbaum**, she affirms the warning that not everything computable ought to be computed, a counsel of **techne** humility often forgotten in the rush to deploy.

On the theological side, **Barth** is a pivotal partner. Herzfeld adopts his **relational imago Dei**, yet modulates it through **Catholic sacramentality** and **Irenaean** growth toward **theosis**. She also learns from **Augustine** on love as weight and from **Aquinas** on the interplay of **intellectus** and **voluntas**. **Buber’s I‑Thou** and **Levinas’ face** provide the phenomenology of encounter that grounds her critiques of **surveillance capitalism** and **data extraction**, where the other is reduced to an **It** and the resistive dignity of the **Thou** is erased. When she articulates **co‑creation**, echoes of **Gaudium et Spes** and later **Laudato Si’** appear, particularly the insistence on the **common good** and the integrality of **ecology**, **economy**, and **ethics** in technological design.

#### 5. Ethics of technology: idolatry, limits, and the common good
The ethical fruit of Herzfeld’s anthropology is a thick account of **technological discernment** under the signs of **idolatry** and **limit**. Idolatry names the absolutization of a relative good such as **efficiency** or **scale**, while limit names the finitude that protects creatures from violence masquerading as benevolence. She proposes **virtue ethics** as a governing frame, where engineers and institutions cultivate **prudence**, **justice**, **temperance**, and **fortitude** in design and governance. This permits concrete guidance concerning **privacy**, **algorithmic bias**, **autonomous weapons**, and **bioengineering**. Her criterion is consistent: does a given technology foster **relational goods**, uphold **vulnerable neighbors**, and promote the **common good** under God, or does it erode **trust**, obscure **responsibility**, and concentrate unaccountable **power**.

Her analysis of **transhumanism** shows the reach of the criteria. Drawing on **Kurzweil’s singularity** thesis and **Bostrom’s enhancement** arguments, she detects a secularized eschatology of **immortality** through **uploading**, **nanotech**, or **genetic editing**. She answers with **Christian eschatology**, where resurrection is **gift**, not achievement, and where the form of life is **agape** patterned by the **Incarnation** and **kenosis** of Christ. The Christian future is not the indefinite extension of fallen capacities but the healing and elevation of persons into **communion**. Hence the **limits of perfection** is not resignation but hope ordered to a different horizon.

#### 6. Co‑creation and sacramentality under pressure
Herzfeld’s notion of **co‑creation** has been both fruitful and contested. She uses it to name the **imago** as a mandate for creative participation in God’s ongoing care for the world. This organises her constructive proposals for **technological stewardship** and aligns with **Catholic** accounts of **grace** that perfect rather than destroy **nature**. She then refracts this through an implicit **sacramental ontology**, where material realities mediate **divine presence** and where human making can be a site of **sanctification** when disciplined by **charity**. Co‑creation is not for her a metaphysical upgrade of human agency into divinity. It is a chastened affirmation that cultures, tools, and institutions can be forms of **cooperative grace**.

Still, Herzfeld places this claim under the pressure of **sin** and **idolatry**. Co‑creation is constantly liable to drift into **Prometheanism**, a drift aggravated by political economy and the seductions of **capital** and **control**. Thus she returns to **liturgical** and **communal** practices as the training ground for rightly ordered desire. The goal is not a checklist of rules but the formation of **persons** who can bear **responsibility** in complex sociotechnical systems. When the habitus is rightly shaped, design can be guided by **solidarity**, **subsidiarity**, and the **preferential option for the poor**, concrete principles that check the tendency of technology to serve the already powerful.

#### 7. Personhood, language, and the non‑substitutability of the other
A hallmark of Herzfeld’s position is the insistence on the **non‑substitutability** of persons. Even as **large language models** and **social robots** mimic empathy and produce plausible discourse, she argues that such **simulations** do not instantiate **selfhood**. To be a person is to be capable of **promise** and so to incur **obligation**. It is to be answerable before the **divine Thou** and to be capable of **forgiveness** in a way that cannot be scripted by statistical next‑token prediction. Her appeals to **language** aim to show that speech is not merely information transfer but **address**. The calling by name, the binding by vows, the agonies of lament and the ecstasies of praise, all test the limits of computational models. Hence she rejects both technophobia and technological messianism. She discourages the **anthropomorphizing** of artifacts and encourages the **humanizing** of institutions that deploy them.

In this key, **algorithmic governance** becomes a crucible for her anthropology. Efficiency gains that displace **relational judgment** are morally costly. An adequate politics of technology requires spaces for **person‑to‑person discretion**, especially in welfare, healthcare, and justice. These are not sentimental remainders from a pre‑digital age but protections for the **imago Dei**. If we forget this, we will make our world in the **image of our machines**, a world of speed, scale, and control, but thin in **mercy**, **patience**, and **hope**.

#### 8. Methodological clarity and constructive balance
Methodologically, Herzfeld models a chastened confidence in **natural reason** and an explicit dependence on **revelation**. She does not claim to deduce ethics from grace nor to quarantine faith from public reason. Instead she takes the **biblical narrative** and **dogmatic tradition** as the grammar through which to interpret empirical findings from **AI research**, while also allowing technical detail to discipline theological speech. Her register is analytic without being reductionist, pastoral without being pietist, and public without surrendering the **confessional** note. The hermeneutic virtue is **discernment** rather than **system‑building**, a choice suited to the rapidly changing landscape of **technology**.

Her constructive balance appears in how she holds together **creation** and **fall**, **gift** and **limit**, **hope** and **prudence**. She refuses despair about human making and equally refuses the naivete that treats tools as neutral. By recentering **imago Dei** as **relation**, she gives theologians and engineers a shared axis for deliberation. By retrieving **virtue ethics**, she recalibrates technological practice away from pure **utilitarian** calculus and toward the **goods internal** to professions and communities.

In sum, Noreen L. Herzfeld has given contemporary theology a durable way to think about **AI**, **personhood**, and **technology** through the prism of **relational imago Dei** and **co‑creation**, with a grammar of **idolatry** and **limit** to underwrite discernment. Her work inhabits the contested borderlands between **digital modernity** and the **Christian tradition** with unusual clarity and charity.

The Reformed and WTS evaluation of Herzfeld’s project centers on three tensions. First, her **relational imago Dei** is a salutary corrective to reductive functionalism, yet classical Reformed orthodoxy defines the **image** principally as **true knowledge, righteousness, and holiness** before God, with **relation** as entailment rather than essence. Elevating relationality risks underdescribing the **noetic effects of sin** and the need for **regeneration** to restore the image in Christ. Second, the idiom of **co‑creation** fruitfully affirms creaturely vocation but can blur, in less careful hands, the **Creator‑creature distinction** and the primacy of **covenantal revelation** over cultural projects. A Reformed alternative would emphasize **vocation under covenant**, **Sabbath limits**, and **two‑kingdoms prudence**, grounding technological ethics in **special revelation** and the **order of creation** rather than a sacramental optimism. Third, her reliance on **Barthian relationality** and broader **Catholic social teaching** aligns with concerns for the **common good**, yet Reformed theology would press a sharper account of **total depravity**, institutional **idolatry**, and the necessity of **Christ’s mediatorship** for any true communion. Even so, her critique of **technological idolatry**, defense of **creaturely limits**, and call to order design by **love of God and neighbor** commendably converge with **Reformed** emphases on **stewardship**, **discernment**, and **neighbor love** within the **covenant**.
