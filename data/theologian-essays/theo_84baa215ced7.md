### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
C. John Collins emerges as a distinctive voice within contemporary **evangelical biblical theology**, formed at the intersection of **linguistics**, **philosophy of science**, and **Pentateuchal studies**. Teaching at **Covenant Theological Seminary** from the early 1990s, he participates in the wider institutional rebuild of confidence in **Scripture’s authority** after the inerrancy debates of the 1970s and 1980s and amid the rising tide of **Ancient Near Eastern** comparative work. His practical engagement in the **ESV translation project** and the **ESV Study Bible** shapes a public-facing ministry where questions of **genre**, **lexicography**, and **narrative discourse** bear immediately on contested doctrines such as the **doctrine of creation**, the **image of God**, and a **historical Adam**. Collins’s intellectual setting is marked by the surge of **analytic philosophy of religion** that reevaluated **miracle** and **divine action**, and by evangelical reckonings with **methodological naturalism** in the sciences. Against both scientistic reductionism and hermeneutical suspicion, he advances a **critical realist** posture that assumes the **autopistos** or self-authenticating authority of Scripture while insisting on disciplined attention to **authorial intention**, **literary form**, and the **cognitive environment** of the original audience.

The backbone of Collins’s method is **linguistic-literary realism**, a calibrated claim that the Bible’s **genres** are truth-bearing and that language, as **speech act**, performs illocutions that secure real-world reference. Drawing from **ordinary language philosophy** and the work of **J. L. Austin** and **John Searle**, he treats biblical discourse as communicative action in which **illocutionary force** and **perlocutionary aim** must be distinguished from the bare locutions. He pairs this with an evangelical retrieval of the **two-books** model, holding that God’s book of **Scripture** and God’s book of **Nature** cannot conflict when rightly read, though each requires its proper methods. The result is neither naive concordism nor skeptical bifurcation, but an epistemic stance in which **exegesis** and **scientific inquiry** can refine each other without either assuming magisterial authority over the other.

#### 2. Genesis 1–4 and the shape of creation doctrine
The volume **Genesis 1–4: A Linguistic, Literary, and Theological Commentary** 2006 distills Collins’s approach. He argues that Genesis 1 is **exalted prose narrative**, a tightly crafted narrative that uses elevated diction, structured repetition, and numerical symmetry to depict God’s **cosmogony** in language fitted for doxological instruction. Against a wooden literalism and against dehistoricizing moves, he contends that **exalted prose narrative** communicates real events through stylized form. The category underwrites his now signature account of **analogical days**: the six days are God’s workdays communicated by analogy to human work-rest rhythms, inculcating **Sabbath theology** and **covenantal patterning**, while leaving open the relation between the narrated sequence and the physical processes that produced the ordered world. This view differentiates itself from the **framework hypothesis** of Meredith Kline by retaining a stronger tether to sequence, and from **young-earth creationism** by declining to treat **yom** as a strict 24-hour unit in this discourse situation.

Within Genesis 1–4 Collins foregrounds the **royal-priestly image of God**, aligning the *tselem* motif with Ancient Near Eastern royal imagery while incorporating the priestly vocation of **garden guardianship** and **cultic service**. The human pair is commissioned to rule and to represent under God’s **kingship**, cultivating the earth as **vicegerents**. He traces **toledot** structuring and discourse features to show how the narrative signals its own claim to ancestral history while signposting symbolic density. The **fall** is narrated as a moral lapse with cosmic ramifications, not a myth of inevitable finitude, and it installs the **covenant of grace** trajectory through the promise of **offspring**. In these expositions Collins ties lexical and syntactic observations to canonical theology, especially **Pauline federalism**, preparing ground for his later work on **Adam**.

#### 3. Reading Genesis well amid ancient worlds and modern science
In **Reading Genesis Well** 2018 Collins addresses disputes over **genre**, **myth**, and **historicity** by arguing that responsible readers must reconstruct the **cognitive environment** of the text’s first audiences. He draws on **Relevance Theory** and advances careful distinctions between what a text asserts and the background models it employs to assert it. Thus **raqia** is rendered **expanse**, a phenomenological descriptor of the sky’s spread rather than a claim about metallic domes, and numerically patterned language or **anthropomorphic temporalities** function pedagogically without dissolving reference. He grants that **cosmic temple** imagery helps express God’s dwelling with his world, yet resists moves, often associated with **John Walton**, that relocate the truth-value of Genesis 1–2 solely to functional ontology detached from material origins. For Collins, **genre and truth** are allies: elevated discourse can still anchor the sequence of God’s **creating, ordering, and blessing** in the shared world.

Collins places this literary realism inside a bigger account of the **science-faith** relationship. He insists that Genesis 1–11 portrays past events, steeped in theological interpretation, that provide the deep structure for **covenant history**. This yields a posture of what might be called chastened openness to scientific proposals about age and process. He rejects **methodological naturalism** as a totalizing ideology while acknowledging methodological constraints within scientific practice. The aim is to preserve both **special divine action** and a robust doctrine of **providence**, where God’s governance appears both in ordinary processes and in redemptive signs.

#### 4. Adam, federal headship, and human origins
The monograph **Did Adam and Eve Really Exist?** 2011 tackles the most acute anthropological controversy. Collins argues for a **mere historical Adam** as the best explanation for the literary and theological architecture of **Genesis 2–4**, the shape of **biblical genealogies**, and the argument of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**. By mere historical Adam he means a real, first human pair at the headwaters of the human family, who fell from righteousness and brought sin and death to their posterity, and whose covenantal headship is presupposed in **federal theology** and the atoning work of **Christ the second Adam**. He underscores how **Luke 3** and **Pauline soteriology** depend upon Adam’s historicity, not as dispensable metaphor but as the narrative grammar of redemption.

At the same time Collins carefully explores the textual hints that allow for complexity within human prehistory. The narrative cues of **Genesis 4** regarding cities and other people, the biblical practice of **selective genealogy**, and the logic of **federal representation** permit, in his judgment, scenarios in which Adam and Eve stand as the divinely appointed head of a larger population. Without dogmatizing a genetic model, he keeps open room for a version of **genealogical monogenism**, in which universal descent from Adam as ancestor and head is eventually true of all living humans, while declining to bind exegesis to a single scientific reconstruction. This pathway critiques proposals by **Peter Enns** and **Denis Lamoureux** that dissolve **Adam** into literature only, while offering a constructive alternative to **young-earth** monogenism that demands a single original breeding pair in recent millennia.

#### 5. Miracles, providence, and the two books
Collins’s earlier works **The God of Miracles** 2000 and **Science and Faith: Friends or Foes?** 2003 set the metaphysical table. He argues that **special divine action** is not a violation of nature but the personal God’s purposive governance of his world, episodically visible as **signs** within the wider fabric of **providence**. Engaging **David Hume’s** argument against miracles, Collins joins the analytic rehabilitation of **testimony** and the undercutting of crude uniformitarianism. He appropriates insights from **Alvin Plantinga** on warrant and the rationality of theistic belief to show that Christian claims about **incarnation** and **resurrection** rest on a defeasible but strong web of evidence, not on a credulous will to belief.

His **two-books** exposition warns against treating **Scripture** as a compendium of scientistic propositions or treating **Nature** as a metaphysical closed system. The sciences are characterized as modeling enterprises with defeasible inferences, while **biblical exegesis** is a disciplined retrieval of **authorial illocutions** within covenantal history. When domains rightly ordered meet, they can be friends. This frame carries forward into his exegesis of **Genesis**, where respect for genre and theology does not undercut confidence in the **historical core** of the narratives.

#### 6. Translation, lexicography, and discourse choices
As a member of the **ESV** translation team and contributor to the **ESV Study Bible**, Collins advocates an **essentially literal** philosophy that prioritizes correspondence at the level of words and structures when this serves clarity and fidelity. He brings **Hebrew linguistics** to bear on contested lexemes. His argument for **raqia as expanse** rather than firmament of metal is a case study in combining comparative philology with attention to the **cognitive environment** and to the phenomenological idiom of ancient discourse. Similarly, discussion of **yom** in Genesis 1 emphasizes discourse marking and literary setting rather than lexeme alone. He notes the **toledot** formula as a discourse signal stitching the primeval and patriarchal narratives into a continuous **ancestral history**, which undermines attempts to wall off Genesis 1–11 into a Freestanding mythic zone.

These translation judgments serve theology. They preserve the Bible’s **public truthfulness** while resisting anachronism. In the climate of disputes over the **firmament**, **dust of the ground**, and **breath of life**, Collins’s choices model how **lexicography**, guided by **canon** and context, protects the line between ancient description and modern theory. The craft of translation becomes an extension of his broader hermeneutic: a steady confidence that **Scripture’s words** are adequate vehicles for **God’s self-communication** in the real world.

#### 7. Interlocutors, allies, and contrasts
Dialogically, Collins stands between extremes. He honors the careful exegesis of **Derek Kidner** and **Gordon Wenham** and draws conceptual aid from **Henri Blocher’s** treatment of the fall, while pursuing a stronger insistence on a **historical Adam** than some earlier mediating positions. He appreciates the cultural insight of **John Walton’s** emphasis on functional ontology and **cosmic temple**, yet he warns that such emphases must not displace **material origins** or the basic narrative sequence of **creation-fall**. With **young-earth creationists**, he shares commitment to **biblical authority** and a real **fall**, but he challenges their construal of **genre**, their adoption of what he regards as overly rigid **chronological literalism**, and their dismissal of mainstream scientific accounts of age.

Opposing the **BioLogos** tendency to relativize the historical content of Genesis under evolutionary frameworks, Collins presses a thick **federal headship** and the literary logic of **Romans 5** that require Adam as a real ancestor. He interacts with apologetic voices like **Hugh Ross**, acknowledging shared concern for scientific plausibility while insisting that the Bible’s **narrative theology** rather than external models should set the terms. These engagements sharpen Collins’s own contribution as a practice of **exegetical patience**: attend to **genre**, listen to **discourse signals**, protect **historical reference**, and then negotiate the provisional claims of the sciences.

#### 8. Doctrinal synthesis: creation, anthropology, sin, and covenant
Collins’s biblical-theological synthesis unfolds along classic doctrinal lines. The **doctrine of creation** affirms God’s free, wise, and good act of bringing all things into being, so that the world’s order is both **gift** and **vocation**. Through **analogical days**, Genesis instructs Israel and the church in **Sabbath rest**, **work**, and the sanctification of time. The **image of God** is a richly textured status and calling, combining **royal representation**, **moral responsibility**, and **priestly service**. Human sin, narrated in **Genesis 3**, is a historical intrusion of culpable rebellion that fractures **communion** and distorts **culture**, not an evolutionary necessity baked into finitude. The **Noahic covenant** marks a universal order of **common grace** and stability in which human history can proceed, while the **Abrahamic** and subsequent redemptive covenants develop the **covenant of grace** culminating in **Christ**.

Anthropologically, the insistence on a **historical Adam and Eve** secures the legal and covenantal logic of **imputation** and the necessity of **atonement**. Collins embeds this in a pastoral realism: Scripture teaches what it needs to teach with sufficient clarity for its saving purposes, and where it leaves **process** or **timing** open, theology should not close prematurely. Thus his synthesis guards **providence** and **miracle**, **truth** and **genre**, **history** and **theology**, in mutually interpreting relation.

#### 9. Contribution and significance
Across his corpus, Collins’s most enduring contribution is the articulation of **exalted prose narrative** and **analogical days** as tools for reading Genesis that protect both **historicity** and **literary artistry**. His defense of a **mere historical Adam** stabilizes evangelical anthropology against the twin erosions of **scientistic reduction** and **hermeneutical skepticism**. By reframing the **miracle-providence** relation and renewing the **two-books** approach, he offers an integrative model for the faith-science conversation that sustains intellectual chastity and theological courage. His practical work in the **ESV** projects displays how scholarly judgments about **lexicon**, **syntax**, and **discourse** flow into ecclesial formation.

As an evangelical Old Testament theologian in a confessional **Reformed** institution, he has become a trusted guide for pastors and scholars who need to preach **Genesis** with confidence and nuance. His combination of **linguistic rigor**, **philosophical clarity**, and **canonical sensitivity** equips readers to inhabit Scripture’s world without anxiety, to discern the **illocutions** of the text, and to receive the **doctrine of creation** and **human origins** as both true and pastorally fruitful.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Collins’s project commends itself in several respects. He robustly affirms **Scripture’s authority and inerrancy**, the **historic fall**, **federal headship**, and **special divine action**, and he reads **Genesis** as real history in covenantal form. His **analogical days** proposal offers a way to honor **WCF 21**’s Sabbath theology and **WCF 4**’s doctrine of creation without imposing a modern chronology on an ancient **exalted prose narrative**, and many within the Reformed world judge this compatible with the Confession’s phrase in the space of six days. He rightly resists both **mythic dehistoricizing** and **mechanical concordism**, preserving the Creator-creature distinction and the unity of **nature and grace** under **providence**. Yet tensions remain. Some will worry that accommodating scenarios with people outside the garden risks diluting traditional **monogenism** and the immediate special creation of **Adam’s body**, potentially stressing received readings of **WCF 6** and **LC 17** on our first parents. Others fear that the elasticity of **analogical days** can be pastorally misused to evacuate the text’s temporal markers. A classical alternative would underscore **creation ex nihilo**, the special formation of Adam from the **dust of the ground** and Eve from Adam, and the universal descent of all mankind from them, while still allowing for literary artistry and a high doctrine of **providence**. Collins’s best insights remain salutary for Westminster commitments when tethered to clear affirmations of **federal theology**, **monogenism as to humanity’s unity**, and the concrete givenness of **history** as the stage where **covenant grace** unfolds.
