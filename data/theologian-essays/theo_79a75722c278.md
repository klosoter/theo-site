### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, institutional setting, and method
Robert B. Strimple emerges from the mid-to-late twentieth-century **Westminster Seminary** orbit as a careful **systematic theologian** whose vocation was the patient transmission and defense of **classical Reformed orthodoxy**. Trained and then long employed within the Westminster institutions, he became a founding faculty member at **Westminster Seminary California** in 1980 and later served as its **president** during 1988 to 1993, shaping a generation with the grammar of **confessional dogmatics**. Strimple stands at the confluence of **Cornelius Van Til’s** presuppositional apologetic, **John Murray’s** covenantal rigor, and **Geerhardus Vos’s** redemptive-historical vision, with the constructive and polemical instincts of **B. B. Warfield** evident in his handling of **Scripture and doctrine**. Within this institutional world, he taught **systematic theology**, with special attention to **Christology**, **soteriology**, and **eschatology**, adopting a stringent adherence to the **Westminster Standards** and the Reformed scholastic norms of **Scripture’s principium** and **dogmatic order**.

Strimple’s method is unembarrassedly **confessional** and low-pretension in its philosophical apparatus, yet it is formally rigorous. He presupposes the **self-authenticating authority of Scripture** and the internal witness of the Spirit as principial to theological knowledge, arguing that **reason** operates ministerially under **revelation**. In this he follows **Van Til’s** critique of autonomous reason, yet he refuses fideism by deploying **historical argument** and **textual exegesis** in service of Christian claims about **Jesus** and **history**. The controlling hermeneutic is **redemptive-historical**, derived from **Vos** and **Ridderbos**, with the covenantal architecture of **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace** organizing **biblical theology** and **systematic loci**. His use of the **analogia fidei** prioritizes canonical coherence and the **two-age eschatology** of the New Testament, extending this framework to questions of **millennialism** and **kingdom**.

#### 2. The Modern Search for the Real Jesus 1995 and Christological apologetics
Strimple’s widely used survey, **The Modern Search for the Real Jesus** 1995, distills two centuries of **historical Jesus** research into a cautionary tale about **presuppositions** and **method**. He narrates the trajectory from **Hermann Reimarus** and **David Friedrich Strauss**, through **Albert Schweitzer**, **Martin Kahler**, and **Rudolf Bultmann**, to **Ernst Kasemann** and the new quests, culminating in late twentieth-century figures such as **John Dominic Crossan**, **Marcus Borg**, and **N. T. Wright**. The through-line is captured in Troeltsch’s critical axioms of **criticism**, **analogy**, and **correlation**, which, when absolutized, occlude the **supernatural** and foreclose the **resurrection** as a unique, history-reconstituting event. Strimple’s critique aligns with **Warfield’s** defense of **miracle** and **Van Til’s** analysis of **autonomous epistemology**, arguing that the **Gospels**, read within the **canon** under the **Spirit**, yield a **historical Jesus** identical with the **Christ of faith**.

The constructive payoff of this work is an accessible but firm restatement of **Nicene-Chalcedonian Christology** and **resurrection realism**. Strimple defends **homoousios** and the unity of **person** in two **natures** according to **Chalcedon**, stressing that **Scripture’s witness** compels us to confess the one **Lord** as **kurios** in continuity with **YHWH**. He presses the **bodily resurrection** as the hinge of **redemptive history**, an event that both grounds **apostolic proclamation** and interprets the **Old Testament** promises by **typology** and **eschatological fulfillment**. Here Strimple combines **exegetical argument** from **1 Corinthians 15** and **Luke-Acts** with a dogmatic insistence on **divine simplicity** and **immutability** in the incarnation, producing a profile of **Christ** that refuses reduction to **religious experience** or **existential decision**. The tone is not merely negative; it is an invitation to an **integrated dogmatics** in which **canon**, **creed**, and **church** coinhere.

#### 3. Eschatology and amillennialism
In **Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond** 1999, Strimple presents the **amillennial** case with clarity and Reformed catholicity. He reads **Revelation 20** within the book’s **recapitulation** structure, arguing that the millennial scene is a symbolic depiction of the **interadvental age**, with the **first resurrection** as believers’ participation in the **heavenly reign** with **Christ** and the **binding of Satan** as a restraint upon his deception of the nations. The exegesis insists upon **apocalyptic genre** and the **analogia fidei**, placing **Revelation** in conversation with **John 5**, **1 Corinthians 15**, and **Romans 16**. This eschatology is integrated with **two-age** categories, the **already and not yet**, and **union with Christ**, presenting the church as a pilgrim people in the overlap of the ages, awaiting the **parousia** and **new creation**.

Strimple’s polemical edge takes aim at both **dispensational premillennialism** and **postmillennial theonomy**. Against **dispensationalism** he contends for the **one people of God** and the unity of **covenant of grace**, critiquing a rigid **Israel-church** dualism and a literalistic reading of **prophetic promise** detached from **Christological fulfillment**. Against **theonomy** and triumphalist **postmillennialism**, he reasserts **law-gospel** distinction and the pilgrim ethic of the **two kingdoms** as broadly Reformed, even as he refuses antinomianism by upholding **the moral law** as a rule of **gratitude**. The positive center remains **inaugurated eschatology** in **Christ**, enabling a robust **sacramental** and **ecclesial** life oriented toward the **consummation** rather than a program of cultural conquest.

#### 4. Covenant theology, justification, and imputation
Strimple’s covenant thought follows **Murray** and **Kline**, holding together the **covenant of works** with Adam and the **covenant of grace** administered progressively through **Abraham**, **Sinai**, **David**, and **new covenant** fulfillment in **Christ**. He deploys the category of **federal headship** to frame **original sin** and **imputed righteousness**, linking **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** in a classic **Reformed federal theology**. This system underwrites his defense of **justification sola fide** as a forensic act grounded in the **imputation of Christ’s righteousness**, inclusive of **active obedience**. Strimple’s essays and lectures in the 1990s and 2000s respond to the **New Perspective on Paul** and later **Federal Vision** trends, insisting that **faith** is the alone instrument of **justification**, not a work, and that **union with Christ** must preserve the **logical distinction** of **justification** and **sanctification** without fracturing their **covenantal unity**.

In this register, Strimple’s handling of **Romans 2** and **James 2** exemplifies his **analogia fidei** method. He reads **Romans 2** as part of Paul’s universal indictment under **law**, not as teaching eschatological **justification by works**, and he construes **James** as addressing a different question of **living faith**. He appeals to confessional language on **imputation** and to the **Christological center** of **law-keeping** as vicarious and representative for the elect. The result is a coherent **ordo salutis** that is organically joined to **historia salutis**, resisting both **nomism** and **antinomianism**. Always pastoral in tone, he connects **doctrine** to the assurance of **conscience**, making **justification** the foundation of **peace with God** and the engine of **sanctification**.

#### 5. Scripture, canon, and hermeneutics
Strimple’s posture toward **Scripture** is that of an old-school **Warfieldian inerrantist** refined by **Van Til** and **Vos**. He insists on the **inerrancy** and **perspicuity** of Scripture for all it affirms, while acknowledging **genre** and **authorial intent** through grammatical-historical analysis. The **canon** is received as the **church’s rule**, not constructed by the academy. He frequently invokes the **self-authenticating** character of the **Word** and the **ministry of the Spirit** to rebut the demand that revelation submit to alien norms. Yet his pages are filled with concrete **exegetical argument**, modeling how **dogmatics** and **exegesis** coinhere. He is alert to modern hermeneutical moods but is uninterested in capitulation to **historicist** or **postcritical** maneuvers that would relativize **apostolic testimony**.

Within this hermeneutic, **typology** and **promise-fulfillment** are privileged categories. Following **Ridderbos** and **Kline**, he reads **Old Testament** institutions and events as **types** consummated in **Christ** and the **church**. This enables his critique of **dispensational literalism** and his case for the **unity of the covenant of grace**. The **Sabbath**, **temple**, **priesthood**, and **sacrifice** are treated as shadows that have found their substance in **Christ**, shaping both **ecclesiology** and **ethics**. His hermeneutical restraint is paired with a high view of **dogmatic tradition**, deploying **Nicene** and **Reformed confessional** grammar as interpretive guides that serve rather than silence exegesis.

#### 6. Ecclesiology, sacraments, and pastoral theology
Though not a specialist in ecclesiology, Strimple aligns with the **Presbyterian** and **Reformed** consensus on **church** and **sacraments**. He holds to **covenant baptism** for the children of believers, argues for **real spiritual presence** in the **Lord’s Supper**, and defends **church discipline** as an expression of **Christ’s keys**. His pastoral instinct surfaces in the way he integrates **doctrine of God**, **Christology**, and **soteriology** with the life of the congregation. He relates **amillennial hope** to the church’s **pilgrim identity**, urging worship that centers upon **Word and sacrament** rather than pragmatic strategies of **cultural triumph**. His Reformed **law-gospel** framework animates preaching that exalts **Christ’s finished work** and calls for **grateful obedience** in the **Spirit**.

In debates over **theonomy** and **civil ethics**, Strimple maintains a classic **Reformed two-kingdoms** sensibility without collapsing common grace into nature or severing **creation** from **redemption**. He rejects efforts to **repristinate** Mosaic civil law for modern polities while honoring the enduring authority of the **moral law**. This yields an ethic of **engagement without eschatological overreach**, consistent with his reading of **Revelation 20** and his expectation of mixed **church and world** until the **parousia**. The pastoral payoff is a sober hope tethered to **resurrection**, not to immanent political arrangements.

#### 7. Interlocutors, influences, and style
Strimple’s tone is learned yet accessible, a catechetical **dogmatics** aimed at pastors and students. He writes as a grateful heir of **Van Til**, **Murray**, **Vos**, and **Kline**, appropriating their **presuppositional critique**, **federal theology**, **eschatological framework**, and **typological exegesis**. He takes **Warfield’s** evidential clarity seriously, especially in discussions of **miracle** and **resurrection**, without abandoning **presuppositional** commitments. Across his published work he engages **Strauss**, **Schweitzer**, **Bultmann**, **Kasemann**, and late twentieth-century voices such as **Crossan**, **Borg**, and **Wright**. In eschatology he debates **Charles Ryrie** and **John Walvoord** on **dispensationalism**, and in Reformed ethics he responds to **Greg Bahnsen** and **Gary North** on **theonomy**. In soteriology he critiques the **New Perspective on Paul** and later **Federal Vision**, siding with **Reformed orthodoxy** on **imputation** and **assurance**.

His stylistic hallmark is a steady appeal to **Scripture**, **confession**, and **history**. He teaches his readers to see **doctrinal loci** as mutually implicating, so that **Christology** entails **justification**, **covenant**, and **ecclesiology**, and **eschatology** refracts every doctrine from **creation** to **consummation**. The effect is a **catechesis** in how to think as a **Reformed theologian** rather than a display of novelty. In this the coherence of his corpus outweighs its breadth, and the seminary classroom and pulpit are its primary theater.

#### 8. Major works and constructive center
The constructive center of Strimple’s legacy rests on two pillars: the Christological apologetic of **The Modern Search for the Real Jesus** 1995 and the eschatological case for **amillennialism** in **Three Views on the Millennium and Beyond** 1999. The former equips pastors to expose the **anti-supernaturalism** lurking in much **historical Jesus** work and to commend **resurrection faith** without retreating into **subjectivism**. It functions as a bridge between the church and academy, offering a map of **German historicism** and **Anglophone criticism** that demystifies their technicality. The latter volume situates **amillennialism** within a robust **two-age** framework and shows how **apocalyptic** functions in **Revelation**, offering exegesis that can be preached.

Around these pillars sit essays and lectures on **justification** and **imputation**, in which Strimple rehearses the **Reformation solas**, emphasizes the **active obedience of Christ**, and reads **Paul** in canonical context. He also writes with clarity on **Christ’s person and work**, attending to **incarnation**, **atonement**, and **ascension** as a single **mediatorial office** across **prophet**, **priest**, and **king**. His insistence on **divine simplicity** and **immutability** in the incarnation coheres with **classical theism**, a bulwark against late-modern drift toward **kenotic** or **process** constructions. Throughout, **churchly concerns** govern his selectivity: every doctrine is for the **edification** of the **saints** and the **integrity** of **preaching**.

#### 9. Historical significance and pedagogical impact
Historically, Strimple belongs to the second generation of the **Westminster** project as it migrated west and consolidated a particular reading of **Reformed catholicity** in North America. As **president** and professor at **WSC**, he helped institutionalize a curriculum that integrated **biblical theology** and **systematic theology**, trained pastors in **confessional fidelity**, and resourced churches in the **OPC** and beyond. His work became a reference point in late twentieth-century evangelical debates about **millennialism**, **inerrancy**, and **justification**, and he served as a measured voice in controversies that threatened to dislodge **Reformed distinctives**. His influence remains palpable in the careers of pastors and theologians shaped by **WSC**, who cite his clarity on **amillennialism**, his defense of the **resurrection**, and his pedagogy in **covenant theology**.

The durability of Strimple’s contribution lies not in a novel system but in a disciplined **retrieval** of **Reformed orthodoxy** for an age tempted by **revisionism** and **suspicion**. He translates the grammar of **confession** into a contemporary idiom without diluting its content. In a climate anxious about the relation of **church** to **academy**, he models how to use the academy to serve the church. The result is a theologian whose name is attached to a reliable posture: argue from **Scripture**, confess with the **church**, and apply with **pastoral wisdom**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and Westminster perspective, Strimple’s strengths are manifest: principled **submission to Scripture**, coherent **covenantal theology**, and a calm, cogent defense of **amillennialism**, **justification by imputation**, and **resurrection realism**. His **presuppositional** stance guards against the corrosive effects of **autonomous reason** in **historical Jesus** study, while his **redemptive-historical** hermeneutic resists atomistic exegesis. Yet tensions appear at familiar fault lines within classical Reformed orthodoxy. Some will worry that a strong **Van Tilian** critique risks prematurely closing common-ground conversation with critical scholarship; others will argue that a Kline-influenced articulation of **covenant of works** and law-gospel may underemphasize creational **natural law** or overidentify **republication** themes, though Strimple himself remains pastorally balanced. His **amillennial** exegesis, while compelling, invites counterarguments from historic **premillennialism** and nuanced **postmillennialism** that emphasize different syntactical features of **Revelation 20** and covenant promises. Finally, his prioritization of **forensic justification** might, in some readings, seem to tether **union with Christ** to a largely logical order rather than a more deliberately ontological union articulated by strands of **Reformed scholasticism**. The best WTS alternative retains his basic commitments while experimenting with thicker accounts of **nature and grace**, more dialogical engagements with **critical history**, and expanded **sacramental** and **ecclesial** retrievals, all without surrendering **sola Scriptura**, **sola fide**, or **two-age eschatology**.
