### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
The British monk **Pelagius** emerged from the world of late antique **ascetic reform**, arriving in **Rome** by the late fourth century as an erudite lay teacher committed to **moral rigor**. He read Scripture not as speculative doctrine but as **exhortative law and gospel**, a divine pedagogy designed to cultivate **virtue**. Within the urban Roman church he observed aristocratic Christians who admired **ascetic ideals** yet tolerated laxity. His response was to stress **liberum arbitrium**, the integrity of created freedom, and the binding character of divine commands. A defining flashpoint was his reaction to **Augustine’s** prayer in the **Confessions**, Give what you command and command what you will, which he heard as a surrender of **moral responsibility** to **effectual grace**. In a culture schooled by Stoic moral discourse and the monastic pursuit of **perfection**, his method was homiletical and practical, aiming at the formation of **habitus** through **Scripture’s commands** and **Christ’s example**.

Pelagius’s epistemic posture was characteristically **ascetical-rational**, reading Scripture as clear instruction that presupposes the agent’s **capacity to obey**. He prized **literal-grammatical exegesis** of **Paul**, yet subordinated speculative questions to **ethical teleology**, the aim of becoming holy. He construed **gratia** in pedagogical and communal terms, as the **law and the gospel**, as the **forgiveness of past sins**, as the **illumination of teaching**, and as the **exemplarity of Christ**. The accent fell on **responsibility**, **discipline**, and **imitation**, rather than on **internal renovation** by **operative grace**. His public teaching was marked by concise **capitula**, practical commentaries, and letters of spiritual counsel directed at aristocratic converts, all within the frame of **ascetic catechesis**.

#### 2. Works, travels, and controversy
Pelagius’s earliest extant material consists of his **Commentary on the Pauline Epistles**, with a focused **Commentary on Romans**, composed roughly between 405 and 409 in **Rome**. These works develop a reading of **Pauline exhortation** as assurance of the believer’s **real ability** to fulfill divine law through **liberum arbitrium** assisted by **gratia adjutrix** understood as instruction and pardon. The upheaval of the **Sack of Rome in 410** prompted his departure from the city. He traveled first to **North Africa**, then settled in **Palestine** by 412, where his teaching drew the suspicion of **Orosius**, a disciple of **Augustine**, and of **Jerome**, whose monastery in **Bethlehem** became a center of anti-Pelagian polemic.

During this Palestinian period, Pelagius composed the **Epistola ad Demetriadem** in 413, a programmatic spiritual letter urging the noble virgin **Demetrias** to strive for **perfection**, grounding his exhortation in the sufficiency of **created freedom** aided by **Scripture** and **good example**. He also wrote **De natura** in 415, sharpening his critique of the doctrine of **original sin** as an affront to the Creator’s goodness. These years brought formal scrutiny. A synod at **Jerusalem** in 415 refused to condemn him, and a subsequent synod at **Diospolis** in the same year, after hearing his **Capitula** and clarifications, acquitted him. Pelagius also sent a **Libellus fidei** to **Pope Innocent I** in 417, emphasizing **Trinitarian orthodoxy** and moral seriousness. Yet developments in **North Africa**, led by **Augustine** and the **Councils of Carthage**, and the shift in papal judgment under **Pope Zosimus** culminated in condemnation by **Carthage 418**, with reiteration at **Ephesus 431**, now linking **Pelagianism** with ecclesial heresy.

#### 3. Anthropology and the goodness of creation
At the heart of Pelagius’s theology is a confident affirmation of **the goodness of creation** and the integrity of **human nature** as made by God. The central axiom is **liberum arbitrium**, the created capacity to will and to act, which, though vulnerable to habituated vice, remains intact after **Adam’s sin**. He distinguished between the Creator’s gift of **posse non peccare**, the ability not to sin, and the agent’s moral history of choices. For Pelagius, Adam’s disobedience damages his descendants not by transmitted **guilt**, but by setting an **exemplary pattern** of vice and by social corruption. The biblical narrative of sin thus functions as a history of **imitation**, not an ontological descent into radical impotence.

This anthropological stance entailed the rejection of **original guilt**. Pelagius held that infants are born in the same moral condition as **Adam before his transgression**, although without his immediate paradisal circumstances. He allowed that **baptism** of infants admits them to **Christ’s kingdom** and to the gifts of the community, but he denied that baptism in their case is the remission of actual guilt. For adults, **baptism** cleanses past sins and empowers renewed **obedience** by incorporating them into the sphere of **gospel instruction**. The implication is that **sin** is always a voluntary act, never a necessity imposed by a corrupted nature, and that divine judgment presupposes genuine **ability**. Pelagius’s language of **meritum** did not mean self-salvation, but the fittingness of God’s rewards in proportion to chosen obedience, a straight reading of **divine justice** within salvation history.

#### 4. Grace, law, and the exemplar Christ
Pelagius’s most controverted claim is his account of **gratia**. He consistently affirmed **gratia adjutrix**, that is, assisting grace, but specified its forms as the **law**, the **gospel**, the **forgiveness of sins**, the **illumination of teaching**, the **fellowship of the church**, the **example of Christ**, and the **encouragement of the Spirit**. He was not opposed to **grace** as such, but to the idea of an **internal, effectual grace** that determines the will apart from its own exercise. He feared that such a doctrine would dissolve moral **responsibility** and render divine commands nonsensical. For Pelagius, the command itself is a grace, because it awakens and directs **liberum arbitrium** toward **beatitude**. The bestowal of **forgiveness** after sin is also grace, because it resets the moral ledger and offers a new beginning.

Christologically, Pelagius read **Christ** as the definitive **exemplar** and **teacher**. The Incarnation reveals the possibility and the path of **obedience**. The **Sermon on the Mount** becomes a curriculum of **virtue**, and apostolic admonitions are concrete exercises of the **church’s pedagogy**. The Spirit’s work is thus primarily **illumination** and **encouragement**, not **irresistible causation**. Predestination he framed as **praescientia**, divine foreknowledge of those who, in the exercise of **liberum arbitrium**, will believe and persevere. In every case, the causality of salvation remains synergistic in the sense that God commands, illumines, pardons, and rewards, while the human agent must will and act. Pelagius did not regard this as human-centered, but as an honor to the **Creator’s gift of freedom** and a safeguard of the **equity of divine judgment**.

#### 5. Exegetical strategies and controverted texts
Pelagius’s **Commentary on Romans** reveals a consistent strategy of reading **imperatives** as implying **ability**. Where **Paul** commands, the Spirit assures that obedience is possible, otherwise the command would be unjust. On **Romans 5.12**, he sides with the reading that because all sinned, death spread to all, opposing the interpretation that all sinned in Adam. He thus develops a doctrine of **imitation of Adam**, rather than **imputation of Adam**, emphasizing personal **responsibility** and the universality of actual sin. On **Romans 7**, he reads the struggle described not as the believer’s concrete experience under grace, but as a rhetorical portrayal of the human being under the law, thereby refusing to concede that even the regenerate will inevitably sin.

In ethical texts such as **Matthew 5–7**, Pelagius accentuates the practicability of the commandments. The call to **perfection** is a real summons enabled by **gratia adjutrix** construed as **teaching** and **forgiveness**. He was prepared to affirm **posse non peccare**, that a Christian could avoid sin, in principle and even in sustained practice, though he did not claim that many attain such constancy. The point was to oppose the creeping **quietism** he feared from appeals to **infirmity** or to **concupiscence** as a necessary condition. Scripture, as he read it, is coherent only if human beings can, by **free will** under grace as instruction, obey its commands.

#### 6. Interlocutors and anti-Pelagian counter-arguments
The primary antagonist was **Augustine of Hippo**, whose anti-Pelagian corpus reshaped Western soteriology. In **De spiritu et littera** 412, **De natura et gratia** 415, **De perfectione iustitiae hominis** 415, **De gratia Christi et de peccato originali** 418, and later **Contra duas epistolas Pelagianorum** 420, Augustine argued that Pelagius misconstrued **grace** and underestimated the ruin of **original sin**. Augustine opposed Pelagius’s **imitation of Adam** with **original guilt** and **concupiscence** as a disordered inclination contracting to all, destroying the natural **posse non peccare** and rendering the will **non posse non peccare** apart from **operative grace**. He insisted that **effectual grace** alone recreates the will unto good, and that divine commands are not annulled by the need for such grace, because God gives what he commands.

In **Palestine**, **Jerome** launched a tart attack in the **Dialogi contra Pelagianos** 415–416, charging Pelagius with Judaizing moralism and with subverting the doctrine of **grace**. The African bishops, through the **Councils of Carthage**, codified the condemnation of propositions like the necessity of **free will** for all acts of righteousness, the denial that **Adam’s sin** harmed his descendants except by example, and the claim that infants are baptized not for the remission of sins. **Orosius** carried the alarm to the East, and although the synod at **Diospolis** 415 acquitted Pelagius after careful framing of his **Capitula**, the tide turned as reports of **Celestius’s** more rigid theses reached Rome. **Pope Innocent I**, then **Pope Zosimus** under imperial pressure, condemned the movement, and **Ephesus 431** reaffirmed that **Pelagianism** is incompatible with the **catholic** understanding of **grace**.

#### 7. Ethical program and ecclesial life
Pelagius’s ethical program was legible and demanding. In the **Epistola ad Demetriadem**, he instructs a young aristocrat in **virtue**, **almsgiving**, **chastity**, and **prayer**, treating these as realistic paths empowered by **Scripture** and by the **church’s discipline**. He championed **ascetic practices** as training in freedom, habituating the will to choose the good, thereby embodying **posse non peccare** in concrete discipleship. The community serves as an instrument of **gratia adjutrix**, not as a reservoir of sacramental power that mechanically transforms the soul, but as a school of **wisdom** and **mercy**. The **forgiveness** of sins in the church remains central, yet it is coordinated with the summons to renewed **obedience** and **growth**.

On **baptism**, Pelagius held that believers receive remission of past sins and adoption into the **people of God**. With respect to infants, his position was intentionally cautious in formal settings, and in his **Libellus fidei** he could sound like a faithful son of the church. But his system leaves little room for **original guilt**, so the undergirding rationale for infant baptism recedes to themes of **incorporation** and **sanctifying context** rather than remission of inherited guilt. On **Eucharist** and **Trinity**, he maintained standard **Nicene** commitments, and no significant dogmatic deviation was charged on those fronts. The theater of dispute remained **anthropology** and **soteriology**, where his ethic of perfection confronted the Augustinian language of **bondage** and **gift**.

#### 8. The logic of divine justice and predestination
An abiding concern for Pelagius was the **equity of divine judgment**. He drew a straight inference from **divine justice** to **human ability**. If the Judge is just, then the defendant must be able to do what is commanded. This premise governed his understanding of **predestination** as **praescientia**, God’s foreknowledge of future free choices. Election, for Pelagius, cannot be a decree that unilaterally determines the will, lest **meritum** and **culpa** be evacuated of meaning. He could speak of **grace** preparing and assisting faith, but always as **external aid** or **pardon**, never as a causal power rendering the unwilling willing. In that light, he treated **Romans 9** as a text about historical vocation and divine patience, not about an **irresistible decree**.

The moral texture of this logic is aligned with ascetic formation. To deny **liberum arbitrium** as operative capacity is to deny the possibility of **virtue**. To claim that **concupiscence** binds all inevitably to ongoing sin is to license moral mediocrity. Pelagius feared a Christian culture where appeals to **grace** function as exculpation rather than empowerment. His system sought to reverse that pattern by reasserting the Creator’s **goodness**, the integrity of the **imago Dei**, and the real possibility of **obedience** under **instruction** and **forgiveness**. The controversy turned on whether this vision safeguards or subverts the **gospel** of Christ.

#### 9. Legacy, reception, and Reformed evaluation
The immediate legacy of **Pelagius** was the crystallization of **Augustine’s** doctrine of **original sin** and **effectual grace**, which gained broad Western reception. Later figures such as **Julian of Eclanum** radicalized the Pelagian line against Augustine, sharpening the appeal to **justice** and **freedom**, while the **Council of Orange 529** rejected **Pelagian** and **Semi-Pelagian** theses while retaining a moderated Augustinianism on **grace** and **free will**. Medieval scholasticism often echoed anti-Pelagian canons even as it developed nuanced accounts of **habitus** and **merit**. In modern discourse, the label **Pelagianism** has become a cipher for moralistic religion and for any system that underplays human **inability** and the necessity of **sovereign grace**.

From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** perspective, the fault lines are plain. Pelagius’s denial of **original guilt** and his emphasis on the **imitation of Adam** stands in deep tension with the **federal headship of Adam** and the **imputation of sin** taught in **Romans 5** as read by classical Reformed theology. His construal of **gratia adjutrix** as chiefly law, teaching, and example fails to meet the biblical testimony to **monergistic regeneration**, **effectual calling**, and **union with Christ** by the Spirit, through which the will is made new. His appeal to **divine justice** as implying natural **ability** overlooks the Reformed distinction between **natural and moral ability**, in which the image remains, yet the moral capacity to will the good is lost apart from **renewing grace**. His reading of **predestination** as mere **foreknowledge** cannot sustain the **God-centered** soteriology of **Ephesians 1** and **John 6**, nor can his ethics of perfection ground the evangelical comfort that salvation is by **grace alone**, not by **merit**. The Reformed alternative upholds the integrity of **creation** and the serious call to **obedience**, while locating both justification and sanctification within the prior, efficacious **grace of God in Christ**, such that commands do not presume native ability, but press the soul to seek and receive **the Spirit’s transforming power**.
