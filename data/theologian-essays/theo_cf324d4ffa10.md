### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The career of **Emily M. Bender** unfolds within the volatile rise of **neural language models** and the attendant restructuring of **AI research** by **platform capitalism**, anchoring her work in the late 2000s through the 2020s at the **University of Washington**. Trained as a **computational linguist** and situated in the nexus of **ACL** venues and public-facing **FAccT** forums, Bender addresses the theological-adjacent question of whether machine systems can bear or participate in **meaning**. Her formation is marked by sustained attention to **linguistic typology** and the perils of **English-only** generalizations, crystallized in the 2011 articulation of the **Bender Rule**: always state which languages an approach targets, refusing tacit universals in **NLP**. Her method is a blend of **methodological naturalism** in science and **critical technical practice** that exposes how infrastructural decisions encode values, thereby declining any sacral aura around **scale** or **optimization**. In the contemporary atmosphere of **AI boosterism**, Bender positions herself as an empirically exacting critic, insisting that claims to **understanding** be moored to robust accounts of **semantics** and of the social lifeworlds in which language lives.

Bender’s epistemic stance is deliberately chastened. Against the sweeping metaphors of **AGI** and **emergence**, she distinguishes **form** from **meaning**, warding off the inference that statistical cooccurrence entails **understanding**. She works from **corpus linguistics**, **typology**, and **human-centered design**, yet insists on the indispensability of **documentation** as a scientific discipline of honesty. Thematically, her labors intersect theological concerns around **language as covenantal practice** and **truth-telling**, for her insistence on **accountability** and **provenance** functions as an ethics of testimony in the realm of technologies that mediate speech.

#### 2. Works and the consolidation of a program
The earliest recognizable pillar in Bender’s program is **On Achieving and Evaluating Language Independence in NLP** (2011), the paper that minted the **Bender Rule** by demanding disclosure of a system’s linguistic scope in **typologically diverse** terms. This methodological dictum presses against the Babel of **English hegemony**, giving concrete shape to a norm of scientific clarity. She pursued didactic consolidation with **Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing** (2013) and the expanded volume **Linguistic Fundamentals for Natural Language Processing II: 100 Essentials from Morphology and Syntax** (2019), which translate core **linguistic theory** into implementable constraints for **NLP** practitioners. In an ecosystem often tempted to treat **data** as pure fuel, these books reintroduce **linguistic structure** as a normative guide.

With **Data Statements for NLP: Toward Mitigating System Bias and Enabling Better Science** (2018), coauthored with **Batya Friedman**, Bender operationalized the ethics of transparency through the concept of **data statements**, a template for specifying dataset composition, demographics, collection context, and intended use. The effect parallels **model cards** and **datasheets for datasets** in adjacent literatures, but Bender’s contribution centers the specificities of **language data** and how **representational harms** propagate through poorly documented pipelines. The argument is simultaneously technical and moral: precise **metadata** serves both reproducibility and neighbor love, tempering hubris with stewardly care.

Two argumentative keystones shape the front edge of her critique. First, **Climbing towards NLU: On Meaning, Form, and Understanding in the Age of Data** (2020), with **Alexander Koller**, formally demonstrates why **distributional form** cannot by itself yield **grounded semantics**. The paper uses thought experiments and formal distinctions to claim that text-only learners lack the causal hooks to disambiguate **reference**, **truth conditions**, or **intentionality**. Second, **On the Dangers of Stochastic Parrots: Can Language Models Be Too Big?** (2021), with **Timnit Gebru**, **Angelina McMillan-Major**, and **Margaret Mitchell**, offers a multi-pronged case that scaling **LLMs** magnifies environmental and **allocational harms**, embeds **bias**, and tempts researchers toward **hype** that conflates fluency with understanding. The now-famous phrase **stochastic parrots** expresses an ontological demotion: these models sample from distributions over observed form without access to the lived worlds that make words mean.

#### 3. Doctrinal core: meaning, grounding, and harm
Bender’s conceptual center is the strong separation of **form vs meaning**, a distinction that bears theological resonance with debates over **sign vs res**, and **locutio vs illocutio** in **speech-act theory**. Her claim is narrow yet potent: without **grounding** in perception, action, or other modalities, a system trained only on text cannot possess **understanding** in any sense robust enough to underwrite **truth-conditional** or **referential** adequacy. This is not mysticism about mind but a sober reading of what statistical learners do with **token sequences**. The formal structure of **LLMs** is indifferent to **world-models**, so their outputs, however coherent, lack the entanglement with **reality** that human speakers achieve by bodily dwelling in a world.

Flowing from that distinction is a program of **documentation** as ethical and epistemic discipline. **Data statements** operate as confessions of situatedness, specifying sources, demographics, and risks so that claims to generalization may be responsibly bounded. She extends this to model claims, advocating precise **evaluation** protocols tied to declared **intended use**, thereby contesting the category mistake by which a fluent system is marketed as a **universal reasoner**. Here the doctrine of harm bifurcates into **representational harms** that deform public discourse and **allocational harms** that differentially distribute opportunity, both intensified by opacity and scale. Across these arguments, Bender resists a false **analogia entis** between human and machine language capacities, insisting instead on a careful analogia instrumenti: tools can augment speech but do not become speakers.

The critique of **scale** is not anti-scientific; it is teleological. Bender asks after the *telos* of language technologies, measuring the gains of **benchmark performance** against the costs of **carbon footprint**, **data colonialism**, and **labor exploitation** in annotation and content moderation. The insistence that **bigger is not always better** functions as an ascetical counsel within the research community, akin to a technological **regula** that prunes desire so as to serve the good of users, annotators, and those named within the data. In short, the doctrinal core is a chastened, accountable empiricism reordered around the social nature of **meaning**.

#### 4. Interlocutors, debates, and the public square
Bender’s interlocution is both collegial and polemical. She collaborates with **Gebru** and **Mitchell** on risk frameworks, with **Koller** on formal semantics, and with **Friedman** on value-sensitive design, stitching together **NLP**, **HCI**, and **STS**. She draws strength from adjacent critics like **Safiya Noble** on **algorithmic oppression** and **Kate Crawford** on **AI extractivism**, amplifying concerns about data provenance and **infrastructural power**. In public debate with **LLM** advocates aligned with major labs at **Google**, **OpenAI**, and **Meta**, she presses the point that claims of **understanding**, **reasoning**, or **knowledge** must not be inferred from **fluency** alone.

The 2020 to 2023 period intensifies these debates. As **GPT-3** and successors sparkle with increasingly persuasive text, Bender’s **meaning vs form** distinction serves as a rebuttal to anthropomorphic marketing. She aligns at points with philosophical critics like **Noam Chomsky**, though from a different theoretical angle, in pushing back against the conflation of **performance** with **competence** and the neglect of **innate structure** or **grounding**. Throughout, she refuses the polarization of **safety** against **ethics**, arguing that the rhetoric of **AI safety** must not displace attention from immediate **harms** and misuses. Her posture is that of a public intellectual, translating dense **linguistic theory** into lines of discernment for journalists, policymakers, and engineers.

#### 5. Practice, governance, and the craft of documentation
If her theory clarifies, her practice equips. The **data statements** template is concrete pedagogy, teaching laboratories to name their **corpora**, identify **demographics**, and flag **limitations**. In concert with **model cards** and **datasheets for datasets**, Bender’s approach makes the scientific record fit for audit and for repentance, rectifying an ethos that too often treats pipelines as proprietary secrets. She recommends institutional mechanisms that bind **claims** to **evidence**, such as standardized **benchmarking** that resists domain drift and up-front **risk assessments** linked to target populations.

This concern extends to **environmental externalities**, where she foregrounds the **energy costs** of training and deployment at mass scale, and to **labor justice**, where she highlights the precarious work of annotators and moderators often located in the Global South. The governance horizon is not merely corporate self-regulation; it is also public law responsive to **allocational harm** and disclosure, with possible analogues to **pharmacovigilance** in drug regulation. Bender’s craft is more than critique; it is a discipline of truthful speech about the conditions of speech technologies.

#### 6. Theological appropriation: language, community, and witness
Although not a theologian, Bender’s account of **language as social practice** is ripe for theological appropriation, especially within traditions that prize **divine speech** and the community’s **testimony**. Her distinction of **form vs meaning** echoes the classical insistence that **Scripture’s words** carry **locution**, **illocution**, and **perlocution**, and that real **understanding** emerges only within the embodied communities that live by those words. Theologically, one might say that meaning inheres in **covenantal use** rather than mere signal exchange, resonating with **speech-act theology** in **Wolterstorff** and **Vanhoozer**. Her caution about **stochastic parrots** functions as a parable against **verbalism**: it is possible to utter orthographic symbols without participating in **truth**.

The imagery of **Babel** also offers a fruitful analogy. Bender’s **Bender Rule** disrupts the drive to erase **linguistic diversity** under the banner of universality. Where modern projects of **scale** seek to aggregate and flatten, the biblical narrative names a divine judgment on proud speech that presumes mastery. A Reformed reading could frame Bender’s defense of **typological diversity** as a prudent embrace of created plurality, checked by **neighbor love** for those whose languages are treated as data noise. If theological language is to witness faithfully, it must attend to the particularities of **peoples**, **tongues**, and **nations**, refusing to mistake the **Anglophone** distribution for a catholic norm.

#### 7. Revelation, hermeneutics, and the limits of machines
Bender’s denial that **LLMs** possess **understanding** guards theological discourse from a subtle mechanization of **revelation**. If meaning is not reducible to **form**, then the **Verbum Dei** cannot be simulated by higher-order **n-gram** models, no matter how extended. The doctrine of **revelation** as **triune self-communication** depends on **personal agency** and **illocutionary intent** that no stochastic sampler can own. In hermeneutics, her insistence on **documentation** is instructive: exegesis likewise requires robust attention to **provenance**, **genre**, **audience**, and **canon**, what the tradition called **sensus literalis** under the rule of **analogia fidei**. Bender’s ethic of transparency can catalyze analogous practices in biblical scholarship and ecclesial teaching, binding claims about **meaning** to responsible accounts of **context**.

At the same time, her account helps police the boundary between **tools** and **agents**. The **imago Dei** locates understanding in embodied, covenantal life, not in predictive text. Pastoral use of **LLMs** must therefore be bounded; such systems may aid drafting but cannot be entrusted with **witness**, **judgment**, or **absolution**. In this sense, Bender furnishes a grammar of limits to preserve **human agency** and **responsibility**, attuned to the **noetic effects of sin** that can be laundered through biased datasets. Machine outputs must be received as fallible artifacts under the **lordship of Christ**, evaluated within the church’s **discernment**.

#### 8. Tensions, lacunae, and constructive dialogue
Bender’s strengths expose tensions for theology. Her methodological **naturalism** brackets **transcendence** and treats semantics as thoroughly **social**, risking a soft **relativism** if no account is given of **truth** beyond community practice. The denial of **understanding** to **LLMs** is sound, yet a theological account wants more than a negative prohibition: it wants a positive ontology of meaning grounded in **divine discourse** and the **participation** of creatures in truth. Without such anchoring, social accounts of meaning can drift toward **constructivism** that leaves prophetic critique unmoored.

Constructive dialogue can proceed by joining Bender’s **form vs meaning** distinction to **speech-act** accounts of **Scripture** and **sacrament**, where **illocutionary force** and **covenantal uptake** are constitutive of understanding. Her ethical program of **documentation** can be baptized into ecclesial practices of **confession** and **accountability**, where claims of generality in teaching are candid about their **cultural** and **linguistic** situatedness. Finally, her critique of **scale** can be placed within a theological economy of **simplicity** and **subsidiarity**, resisting technocratic consolidation in favor of local, **neighbor-oriented** applications that honor the grain of creation.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Bender’s work supplies salutary cautions and requires principled supplementation. Positively, her insistence on **creaturely limits**, **documentation**, and the non-identity of **fluency** with **understanding** aligns with **sola Scriptura**’s concern for truthful words tethered to **divine intent**, and with a doctrine of **imago Dei** that reserves understanding to personal agents. Her exposure of **idolatry of technique** in the cult of **scale** accords with a covenantal critique of **Babel** and warns the church against outsourcing **discernment** to stochastic tools. Likewise, her attention to **representational** and **allocational harms** resonates with **neighbor love** and the moral order of **natural law** as clarified by special revelation.

Negatively, her **methodological naturalism** leaves no category for **revelation** as **triune speech**, and her social grounding of **semantics** risks severing **truth** from **correspondence** to God’s created order, undermining **theological realism**. A Reformed corrective would integrate her empirical insights into a **speech-act** theology of **Scripture**, where **illocution** and **perlocution** are anchored in **divine authorship**, and would relocate **grounding** in the Creator-creature covenant rather than in social practice alone. In practical terms, Reformed theology will receive her warnings as guardrails for the **creation mandate** in technology, harnessing tools under the **sufficiency of Scripture**, ordering innovation by **justice** and **prudence**, and refusing the **autonomy** of technique that forgets **grace**. On this reading, Bender becomes an ally in resisting **semantic idolatry** and in clarifying that humanly mediated **witness** cannot be mechanized, even as her framework is chastened by the confession that meaning ultimately proceeds from **God’s own speech**.
