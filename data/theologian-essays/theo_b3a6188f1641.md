### ESSAY
Steve Jeffery emerges as a pastor-theologian in late modern **Reformed evangelicalism**, shaped by the British conversation around the cross at the turn of the twenty-first century and the institutional ethos of **Oak Hill College** under **Mike Ovey**. Trained originally in the natural sciences, Jeffery brings a disciplined analytic rigor to exegesis and dogmatics, an approach that seeks coherence between **biblical theology** and **systematic theology**, and that prizes clarity for the church. The post-1990s British scene saw high-profile challenges to **penal substitutionary atonement**, not least **Steve Chalke** in 2004 accusing the doctrine of portraying a form of divine cruelty. Jeffery's ministerial context in North London and his participation in the Oak Hill community pulled him directly into this controversy. His work moves self-consciously within **confessional Reformed orthodoxy** and the grammar of **covenant theology**, yet is crafted for catechesis, preaching, and public apologetics rather than for intramural scholastic debate.

Methodologically, Jeffery foregrounds **canonical exegesis** that tracks typological trajectories from **Torah sacrifice** and **covenant curses** to the cross of **Christ**, framed by federal categories like **representative headship** and **imputation**. Texts such as **Isaiah 52–53**, **Romans 3.25–26**, **Galatians 3.13**, **2 Corinthians 5.21**, and **1 Peter 3.18** carry the argument that Jesus bears the penalty of sin as a substitute, placating divine wrath in an act of **propitiation** as well as **expiation**. He argues that penal substitution functions as the integrating center for the scriptural atonement motifs, coordinating **Christus Victor**, **ransom**, **satisfaction**, and **moral influence** within a governing judicial framework of **divine justice**. Theologically, he insists on a triune pattern of agency, stressing the **pactum salutis** as the eternal counsel of the **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**, and highlighting the Son's voluntary obedience, so that the cross is the **self-substitution of God** rather than an act of the Father upon a third party.

The signature achievement is **Pierced for Our Transgressions** in 2007, coauthored with **Mike Ovey** and **Andrew Sach**, written as a comprehensive defense of **penal substitutionary atonement**. The work arose from pastoral needs in the UK and a perceived drift among evangelicals toward non-penal conceptions of the cross. Its structure is tripartite. First, it offers exegetical essays on key passages, contending for **hilasterion** in Romans 3 and **hilasmos** in 1 John as properly read in propitiatory terms aligned with **Leon Morris** and **D. A. Carson** against **C. H. Dodd**. Second, it surveys historical theology from the **Fathers** through the **Reformation** and into modern evangelicalism, to show that penal notes are not a late Protestant novelty. Third, it addresses objections grouped as biblical, theological, ethical, and pastoral, aiming to neutralize the charge of incoherence or moral repugnance. The tone is unapologetically catechetical, with detailed exegesis and footnoted appeals to **John Calvin**, **John Owen**, and **J. I. Packer** anchoring the work in Reformed sources.

At the level of detailed argument, Jeffery and his coauthors insist that **propitiation** and **expiation** are mutually implicative. By dealing with sin's guilt and curse as **covenantal liability**, Christ removes the offense and turns aside holy wrath. They correlate **lex talionis** in the Mosaic law with the narrative of representative suffering in Israel's Scriptures. **Galatians 3.13** is read as the Messiah bearing the **curse of the law** in the mode of penal substitution, while **2 Corinthians 5.21** is taken to teach **imputation** both of sin to Christ and righteousness to believers. Repeatedly, they appeal to the forensic horizon of **justification**, aligning the atonement with the law court rather than with a purely therapeutic or exemplarist frame. The logical centerpiece is the claim that only the penal, substitutionary dimension preserves both the moral seriousness of sin and the gratuitous character of grace.

Historically, Jeffery challenges the narrative made popular by **Gustaf Aulen** that **Christus Victor** is the primitive and proper paradigm and that penal substitution is a late scholastic or legalistic intrusion. His team assembles a dossier of texts to show penal and substitutionary themes in figures such as **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, and later in medieval doctors moving toward **Anselm's** account of **satisfaction**. They argue that the Reformers, especially **Calvin**, integrate satisfaction with penal elements and that **Reformed scholastics** like **Francis Turretin** and **John Owen** provide a mature synthesis that is biblically faithful and doctrinally precise. In the modern era, Jeffery highlights evangelical retrievals by **J. I. Packer** in What Did the Cross Achieve and **John Stott** in The Cross of Christ, framing penal substitution as theologically rich rather than narrow, and as crucial for preaching and **assurance**.

A significant section of Jeffery's case responds to ethical and theological objections. Against the charge popularized by **Steve Chalke** that penal substitution entails a form of divine child abuse, Jeffery insists on **Trinitarian unity of will**, the Son's **voluntary obedience**, and the distinction between **punishment** and **cruelty** within **divine justice**. Drawing on **Owen's** priestly categories, he frames the cross as a priestly self-offering, grounded in *perichoresis* and the mutual love of Father and Son in the **Spirit**, so that the agency of the atonement is *ad intra* one and *ad extra* appropriately ordered. He also answers the worry that forgiveness negates justice by arguing that the biblical God forgives in a way that upholds **retributive justice** through substitution, citing **Romans 3.26** as the classic X is both just and the justifier text. The oft-repeated antithesis between wrath and love is rejected in favor of a biblical symphony in which holy wrath is the form of love's opposition to evil.

Jeffery's defense is doctrinally integrative. He ties **penal substitution** to **union with Christ**, noting that substitution is covenantal participation by representation rather than mere exchange of external properties. The believer is crucified and raised with Christ, and thus **imputation** is never detached from **incorporation**. He sets the atonement within the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, so that the second Adam bears the sanction of the broken first covenant and inaugurates the blessings of the new. He connects atonement to **justification** as its judicial effect, to **adoption** as its familial fruit, and to **sanctification** as its transformative entailment, with the resurrection proclaimed as vindication and the cross as the decisive curse-bearing moment. In pastoral terms, he emphasizes how a clear view of substitution fosters assurance, humility, gratitude, and missional zeal, and orders the **sacraments** of baptism and the Lord's Supper as signs and seals of a finished work.

In engaging other models, Jeffery is careful to affirm the breadth of biblical imagery while resisting the disjunctions that would displace penal substitution. He affirms **Christus Victor** as a consequence of propitiatory victory over sin and the powers, not as a replacement for **satisfaction**. He distinguishes **governmental theory** associated with **Hugo Grotius** from a truly substitutionary account, commending the former's emphasis on public justice but challenging its non-substitutionary core. He appreciates the stress on participation among advocates of **recapitulation** and **theosis**, yet argues that these motifs require a judicial ground to be more than moral or metaphysical uplift. With respect to **Barth**, he welcomes the insistence on trinitarian agency and the objectivity of grace but demurs at the denial of God punishing the Son and the refusal of **imputation** in the classic Reformed sense. The net effect is a generous but firm centering of penal substitution as the axial doctrine of the atonement.

Jeffery also addresses hermeneutical and philological questions head-on. On **hilasterion**, he contends for a translation that includes **propitiation**, invoking cultic background in **Leviticus**, the **mercy seat**, and the flow of argument in **Romans 1–3**. He engages the claim that **wrath** language is metaphorical by insisting that while anthropomorphic, the referent is real, consistent with **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** rightly understood. He further clarifies that **substitution** is not mere exchange but the personal act of the incarnate Son as **mediator**, grounded in *anhypostasia* and *enhypostasia*, according to which the humanity of Christ has its subsistence in the eternal person of the Son. Such christological specificity wards off caricatures that imagine a third party punished in place of sinners. He uses these dogmatic tools to demonstrate that the doctrine is neither a detour from Christology nor a freestanding theory of law, but the fruit of creedal orthodoxy applied to soteriology.

Reception of Jeffery's work within **Reformed evangelicalism** has been notable. The book circulated widely in the UK and beyond, serving as a touchstone for pastors catechizing congregations amid cultural suspicion of **wrath** and **judgment**. Scholars appreciative of the project include expositors committed to **Westminster Confession** soteriology and to the exegetical legacy of **Morris**, **Packer**, and **Stott**. At the same time, critics within the broader Reformed family have queried whether Jeffery gives sufficient voice to the **resurrection** as soteriologically constitutive rather than confirmatory, whether the focus on forensic categories risks marginalizing **participation** and **new creation**, and whether the historical case claims too much continuity in the **Fathers**. Jeffery's own pastoral posture and repeated insistence on holding multiple biblical motifs together have, however, made his work a stabilizing resource during a period of polemical fragmentation.

Jeffery's ongoing ministry has straddled ecclesial and geographical contexts in the UK and the United States, continuing to model the **pastor-theologian** vocation. He draws deeply on **John Owen** and the Puritan synthesis of **covenant**, **priesthood**, and **sacrifice**, while engaging contemporary biblical scholarship and analytic concerns about moral theory and divine action. His signature contribution remains the clarifying and defending of **penal substitutionary atonement** in a way that is exegetically attentive, historically aware, and pastorally applied. For students of **systematic theology**, his work offers a case study in how confessional commitments can resource constructive engagement with modern critiques without capitulation or defensiveness, and how the cross as **propitiation** and **expiation** can be preached as the blazing center of the gospel.

From a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, Jeffery's contribution aligns strongly with **covenant theology**, **imputation**, and the **pactum salutis**, and it provides a clear defense of **penal substitution** that serves preaching and assurance. Two tensions deserve note. First, the juridical idiom can eclipse the redemptive-historical fullness of **union with Christ** and the soteriological necessity of the **resurrection** and **ascension** as more than attestation, a risk mitigated when penal substitution is nested within a robust two-Adam **federalism** and a richer account of **participation**. Second, the historical retrieval occasionally stretches the patristic evidence, which calls for a more nuanced admission of development while still confessing confessional **satisfaction** as a material norm. A constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy is to foreground the triune **covenant of redemption** as the theater of the Son's priestly obedience, to articulate **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** as the grammar of suffering love, and to integrate **Christus Victor** and **recapitulation** as necessary fruits of the penal center. Within these bounds, Jeffery's core thesis stands as a faithful and useful articulation of the gospel's heart.
