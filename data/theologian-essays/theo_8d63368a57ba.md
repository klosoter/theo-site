### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Jared Oliphint emerged as a contemporary voice within the **Reformed** retrieval of **classical theism**, working in proximity to **Westminster Theological Seminary** and the **Reformed Forum** network during the 2010s. The wider context included evangelical controversies over **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and the very possibility of **natural theology**, with analytic philosophy exerting pressure toward **theistic personalism** and temporalist accounts of **God**. In that ferment, Oliphint’s signal contribution is methodological: a coherent **covenantal epistemology** that deploys catholic metaphysics under the norm of **Scripture**. His horizon is decisively shaped by **Cornelius Van Til’s** emphasis on the **Creator-creature distinction**, **Herman Bavinck’s** organic **dogmatics**, and the Reformed scholastic grammar of **archetypal and ectypal theology**. He refuses both a biblicism that eschews metaphysics and a metaphysical rationalism that outruns exegesis. The watchwords are **Reformed catholicity**, **analogical predication**, and the insistence that theological grammar must serve **theologia** not displace it.

At the level of method, Oliphint argues that the Protestant doctrine of **Scripture** entails a determinate ontology of revelation and therefore a determinate **metaphysics**. He aligns with **Richard A. Muller’s** reading of the post-Reformation scholastics to recover the **scholastic distinction** between *theologia archetypa* and *theologia ectypa*, so that our creaturely knowledge is analogical and dependent yet objectively true. This allows him to commend **Thomas Aquinas’s** best metaphysical insights, such as **act and potency** and **simplicitas Dei**, without importing an autonomous **analogia entis**. The covenantal point is that all knowledge of God is from **God’s voluntary condescension** in the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, so metaphysical discourse must be chastened by the economy of **revelation**. Thus he interlocks **Van Til’s antithesis** with a robust **metaphysical realism**, resisting both nominalism and univocity, and framing dogmatics by *opera ad extra sunt indivisa* and the Christological pattern of **redemptive history**.

#### 2. Retrieval of classical theism
Oliphint’s constructive center is the doctrine of God, especially **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility**. He rejects the caricature that **simplicity** dissolves biblical plurality or renders God abstract. Instead, following **Aquinas** as read through **Bavinck**, he treats **simplicity** as the entailment of **aseity**: God is **ipsum esse subsistens**, pure actuality (*actus purus*) without composition, contingency, or unrealized potency. This grammar secures the biblical teaching that God is **one** and **unchangeable** while explaining why divine attributes are not parts but identical with the single, simple essence. He draws on the scholastic axiom that in God **essence and existence are one**, while reminding Protestants that this grammar functions inside a Reformed doctrine of **Scripture** that safeguards incomprehensibility and **analogical** predication. The upshot is a positive retrieval of **classical theism** within a **confessional Reformed** frame.

Within that retrieval, Oliphint is careful to integrate **Trinitarian** dogma with **simplicity**. He stresses **subsistent relations** as the key formal category by which the una essentia is personally subsistent as **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**. Thus he treats **eternal generation** and **spiration** as relations of origin within the simple essence, not as accidents or parts. The doctrine of **inseparable operations** follows: because the divine essence is one, the external works of the Trinity are indivisible, though appropriated according to personal properties. This yields a coordinated account of **autotheos of the Son** in the sense recovered by **Calvin** and extended by Reformed scholastics, while maintaining the traditional taxis of **from the Father** through the Son in the Spirit. The claim is not novelty but catholicity: **simplicity** and **Trinity** are not competitors but mutually implied.

#### 3. Interlocutors and polemics
Oliphint’s public work often advances by clarification rather than confrontation, yet he trades in sharp distinctions that answer live controversies. With **analytic theists** like **Alvin Plantinga** and **William Lane Craig**, he questions the adoption of **univocal predication**, temporal models of **eternity**, and a **theistic personalism** that treats God as a maximal instance within a genus. He counters with **analogical predication** grounded in **revelation**, defending **atemporal eternity** and **immutability** as evangelical grammar rather than philosophical add-ons. Against **open theism** and **process** motifs, he presses the covenantal text of **Romans 9** and the Creator-creature gap of **Isaiah 40** within a classic **aseity** framework.

Among Reformed interlocutors, Oliphint navigates internal debates about **natural theology** and **Thomism**. He follows **Van Til** and **Bavinck** in denying an autonomous **natural theology**, yet he affirms a principled, ministerial use of **natural reason** and metaphysical principles under **Scripture**. Drawing from **Turretin** and **Polanus**, he distinguishes between an illicit **analogia entis** that posits a neutral metaphysical ladder, and a legitimate **analogia fidei** that authorizes analogical talk because God has named himself. He thus resists both blanket dismissals of **Aquinas** and uncritical **Reformed Thomism**, advocating instead a **Reformed catholic** appropriation governed by covenantal prolegomena.

#### 4. Apologetics and epistemology
In apologetics, Oliphint remains squarely within **covenantal apologetics** received from **Cornelius Van Til** and developed at **Westminster Theological Seminary**. He articulates the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief not as an extrinsic ecclesiastical mark but as a metaphysical condition of fallen **noetic** rebellion. Yet he insists that this antithesis does not obviate **common notions** or **natural knowledge of God**. The exchange between **general revelation** and **special revelation** is not competitive: the former renders all men **without excuse**; the latter graciously heals the mind in Christ and Scripture. Under this frame, he can endorse certain **Thomistic** arguments, such as causal demonstrations, provided they are employed ministerially to elucidate what **revelation** already obligates, rather than as a neutral path to a generic deity.

Epistemologically, this requires a thick account of **analogy** and **incomprehensibility**. Oliphint deploys the Reformed scholastic doctrine of **archetypal-ectypal** knowledge to guard the transcendence of **theologia Dei** and the dependence of **theologia viatorum**. He eschews both **fideism** and **rationalism**, arguing that Scripture gives us a covenantally situated access to reality, including **metaphysical** reality. Hence the patterns of **redemptive history**, developed by **Geerhardus Vos** and later **biblical theologians**, must be allowed to norm the deployment of metaphysical terms. This yields a chastened boldness: we must speak metaphysically because Scripture compels it, but we must also speak analogically because Scripture teaches **incomprehensibility**.

#### 5. Exegetical integration and doctrinal development
A notable feature of Oliphint’s program is the tight integration of **exegesis** with **dogmatic** grammar. He is wary of proof-texting metaphysical theses yet argues that biblical idiom presupposes metaphysical commitments. For instance, the Yahwistic assertion I am who I am in **Exodus 3:14** commits the canon to **aseity** and **simplicity** understood as fullness of being, and the protocol of **John 1** requires a **Trinitarian** reading where the Word is both with God and God. Similarly, the doctrine of **inseparable operations** is not a scholastic imposition but prompted by the narrative of creation, covenant, and Christ where the **triune** God acts as one. He reads texts like **Isaiah 48** and **John 5** through the lens of **eternal generation**, shaping a critique of **social trinitarianism** and **subordinationism** that would sever the one **essence** from the three **persons**.

Doctrinally, Oliphint follows **Bavinck** in championing the organic unity of **dogmatics**. **Christology**, **soteriology**, and **ecclesiology** are downstream from **theology proper**. He criticizes evangelical tendencies to treat **immutability** as pastoral liability, arguing instead that **impassibility** guarantees the covenant faithfulness proclaimed in **Lamentations 3** and **James 1**. By stressing *opera ad extra* as indivisible and *ad intra* relations as the source of personal distinction, he locates assurance in the simplicity and stability of God, not in a mutable divine pathos. This is a pastoral apologetic developed from **classical theism** and anchored in **Reformed confessions**.

#### 6. Natural theology and law
Oliphint’s stance on **natural theology** is both sympathetic and qualified. He affirms the catholic conviction that God’s invisible attributes are perceived in the things that have been made, grounding a doctrine of **natural law** echoed in **Romans 2**. Yet he refuses any natural theology that functions apart from or prior to covenant, because all human knowing is historically located within **creation, fall, and redemption**. He therefore appropriates **Aquinas’s** causal principles and **Aristotle’s** act-potency analysis in a ministerial way, as elucidations of general revelation that Christians can deploy precisely because **Scripture** authorizes them. The rule is principial: no autonomous **ratio**; yet no anti-metaphysical biblicism. This balance allows him to argue against both Kantian restrictions on speculative reason and evangelical voluntarism that detaches divine attributes from being.

In moral theology, this yields a restrained appropriation of **natural law** as creational wisdom consistent with **Westminster Confession** teaching on the law written on the heart. He cautions that without **theological metaphysics** one cannot sustain a non-positivist account of moral norms, but likewise without **redemptive history** one cannot narrate the law’s covenantal administration. The dialectic is governed by **creation-eschatology** and mediated by **Christ**, the telos of the law, who fulfills and reconfigures moral existence within the **new covenant**.

#### 7. Contemporary debates and clarifications
Oliphint’s interventions are often clarificatory in fast-moving debates. In the discussion of **eternal functional subordination**, he underscores the dangers of importing temporal subordination into **Trinitarian** dogma, reminding readers that the Son’s incarnate obedience is according to his **assumed human nature**, while **ad intra** relations of origin remain the only ground of personal distinction. In disputes over **theistic mutualism**, he aligns with contemporary classical theists such as **James Dolezal** in rejecting claims of change or dependency in God, while framing the case within **covenantal** rather than **Thomistic-only** prolegomena. Regarding **divine temporality**, he argues that biblical history is compatible with a timeless creator precisely because of the rule of **inseparable operations** and the doctrine of **incarnation**, where the Logos enters time without any change in the divine nature.

In evangelical philosophical theology, he questions the overuse of **possible worlds semantics** and **counterfactuals** to drive doctrines like **middle knowledge**, suggesting instead that the Reformed account of **providence** and **decree** can explain modal truth conditions without positing creaturely-independent truthmakers. This critique relies on a metaphysics of **divine ideas** and a doctrine of **concursus** that aligns with **Turretin** and **Owen**, while allowing fruitful dialogue with analytic tools as subordinate instruments.

#### 8. Pedagogy, institutions, and influence
Though not primarily known for monographs, Oliphint’s influence has been mediated through **Reformed Forum** conversations, **seminary** teaching environments, and public seminars that catechize a rising generation in **classical theism**. By reintroducing categories like **act and potency**, **formal and final causality**, and **subsistent relations** to readers shaped by **biblical theology**, he has helped normalize a Reformed catholicity that neither collapses into a **Thomist confessionalism** nor retreats into an anti-metaphysical **biblicism**. His oral and written work often features careful definitions, historical retrieval from **Reformed scholastics**, and polemical restraint, modeling the very **analogical** modesty he commends.

Institutionally, this influence coincides with a broader recalibration at **Westminster Theological Seminary** and adjacent platforms, where the rehabilitation of **simplicity** and **impassibility** has gained traction. Alongside figures like **Bavinck** in translation and contemporary exponents of **classical theism**, Oliphint’s methodological clarifications have equipped pastors and students to read the **confessions** with metaphysical literacy. The enduring fruit is a cadre that can navigate **Aquinas**, **Van Til**, and **Muller** without collapsing their distinct commitments, embodying a confident yet chastened **Reformed dogmatics**.

#### 9. Prospects and programmatic summary
The program can be summarized as a threefold cord: first, the primacy of **covenantal epistemology**, where **Scripture** determines the scope and grammar of theological claims; second, the necessity of **metaphysical realism**, where classical categories like **simplicity** and **act-potency** secure a coherent confession of **God**; third, the ecclesial task of **Reformed catholicity**, where Protestant dogmatics learns from the best of **Aquinas** and the **scholastics** while standing on its own **confessional** feet. Each strand depends on the others. Without covenant, metaphysics runs free; without metaphysics, exegesis limps; without catholicity, Reformed identity becomes a sect. Oliphint’s contribution is to tie these strands tightly and teach others how to keep the knot.

The payoff is doxological and pastoral. A God who is **simple**, **immutable**, and **impassible** is fit to be our **rock** and **salvation**; a doctrine of **inseparable operations** secures the unity of **redemption**; a principled **analogy** preserves mystery while protecting meaningful predication. In a world tempted by either **philosophical univocity** or **pious agnosticism**, Oliphint’s retrieval points to a path of wisdom, where **Scripture**, **tradition**, and **reason** are rightly ordered under the Lordship of the triune **God**.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a Reformed and **Westminster** vantage, the strengths are conspicuous. Oliphint joins a widening consensus that **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and **impassibility** are not optional scholasticisms but the grammar of biblical **theism**. His covenantal ordering of **metaphysics** under **revelation** guards from capitulation to an autonomous **analogia entis** and keeps faith with **Van Til’s** antithesis while expanding the toolset with **Aquinas’s** best insights. Potential tensions remain. The calibration between a robust **antithesis** and a ministerial use of **natural theology** demands constant policing; the appropriation of **act-potency** and **subsistent relations** must never become a parallel magisterium alongside **exegesis**. In some Reformed quarters, fears persist that any Thomistic grammar risks softening **Creator-creature** asymmetry or marginalizing **redemptive history**. The best alternative, however, is not retreat but refinement: double down on **archetypal-ectypal** modesty, make **inseparable operations** and *opera trinitatis ad extra* integral to biblical-theological method, and let **Bavinck’s** organic motif and **Vos’s** redemptive-historical focus regulate metaphysical speech. When ordered by **covenant**, metaphysical realism serves rather than subverts **Reformed orthodoxy**; on that point Oliphint’s program is a salutary and durable guide.
