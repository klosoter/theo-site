### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and intellectual posture
The career of **Michael J. McClymond** unfolds within the late modern resurgence of **evangelical historical theology**, where retrieval of **patristic** and **Reformed** sources meets the pressures of **historical criticism** and pluralist culture. Writing and teaching from **Saint Louis University**, a Jesuit context, McClymond occupies a liminal space that cultivates both **evangelical** doctrinal clarity and **catholic** breadth of inquiry. His scholarship arises as debates over **universalism**, the legacy of **Jonathan Edwards**, and the future of **Christology** intensify across Protestant and Catholic settings. The intellectual climate includes **postliberal** narrative theology, **ressourcement** Thomism, and analytic **theology**; McClymond is conversant with each yet resists any paradigm that would eclipse the **biblical canon** as norm. The hallmark of his work is historically dense argumentation married to dogmatic judgments under the rule of *analogia fidei*, all in service of the church’s proclamation of **judgment** and **grace** in **Jesus Christ**.

#### 2. Method: genealogy in service of dogmatics
McClymond’s basic method blends **genealogy of ideas** with normative **dogmatics**, a two-horizon approach that lets historical trajectories be descriptively traced and then theologically tested. He neither dissolves doctrine into historicism nor abstracts dogma from the **traditio**. The result is a ressourcement of **Augustinian** and **Reformed** instincts deployed against modern **monisms** and **esoteric** religiosities. His historical lens probes conceptual continuities, such as links between **theosophy** and modern **universalism**, or between **Neoplatonism** and **Edwardsian** aesthetics, while his doctrinal horizon asks whether such lines cohere with **Scripture**, **creedal orthodoxy**, and a robust **Christology**. The canon functions as a regulative principle through the *analogia fidei*, and the church’s worship informs knowing by a modest **lex orandi lex credendi**. McClymond’s procedure yields what might be called evangelical ressourcement: the recovery of **classical theism**, **Trinitarian** orthodoxy, and **eschatological duality**, without ceding intellectual ground to historicist relativism.

#### 3. Edwards as master teacher of evangelical theocentrism
The early signal of McClymond’s constructive interests appears in **Encounters with God** 1998, which develops **Jonathan Edwards** as theologian of divine self-communication, **religious affections**, and **Trinitarian** beauty. He reads Edwards through aesthetic and spiritual categories, emphasizing the new sense of the heart as participation in **God’s glory**, an evangelical **ordo amoris** oriented to the **visio beatifica**. The later synthesis with **Gerald R. McDermott**, **The Theology of Jonathan Edwards** 2012, frames Edwards as a **Reformed catholic**, integrating **predestination**, **revival piety**, and a participatory **typology** that sees creation as a communicative theater of **Christ**. McClymond resists overly metaphysical reconstructions of Edwards that lean toward **panentheism** or collapse **Creator-creature distinction**, pressing instead for a **classical** reading of **Trinity**, **creation**, and **redemption**. In dialogue with **Sang Hyun Lee** on dispositional ontology and with **Oliver D. Crisp** on God and creation, he stresses that Edwards’s emanational language remains bounded by **ex nihilo** creation and the **sovereign will** of God.

#### 4. Edwardsian doctrines: beauty, Trinity, and redemption
Across Edwards studies McClymond highlights doctrines that coherently build a **theocentric** evangelical theology. The **Trinity** is the arche of reality, with the Son as **logos** and the Spirit as the bond of **holy love**, ordering salvation by **union with Christ**. The aesthetic grammar of glory explains **affections**, **virtue**, and **sanctification**, yet it never displaces the forensic centrality of **justification** by faith. The economy of **grace** is read as an ordered communication of God’s triune life, resonating with *perichoresis*, while avoiding any tendency toward **Spinozist** necessity or **occasionalism**. Typology for McClymond functions as a mode of canonical reasoning, not an esoteric code, so that Scripture’s own **Christological** shape guides Christian perception of reality. This Edwardsian project furnishes a theological anthropology marked by **concupiscence**, conversion, and perseverance, and an eschatology keyed to **judgment** and **glory**, not to universal restoration. The upshot is a **Reformed** account of desire, beauty, and beatitude ordered to the *communicatio idiomatum* and **atonement** in **Christ**.

#### 5. Christology for today: Familiar Stranger
In **Familiar Stranger** 2004, McClymond addresses **Christology** with equal parts historical literacy and evangelical confession, introducing **Jesus of Nazareth** through converging lines of evidence. He appropriates **historical-critical** insights while challenging reductive **Bultmannian** skepticism, engaging interlocutors such as **John P. Meier**, **N. T. Wright**, and **Richard Bauckham**. The work affirms the **incarnation**, **resurrection**, and **kingdom of God** as structural pillars of the gospel, correlating **Son of Man** sayings with apocalyptic expectation and the unity of the canonical **Gospels**. McClymond distinguishes responsible historical inquiry from corrosive **naturalism**, arguing that the **acts of God** in Christ are epistemically available through apostolic testimony and the Spirit’s witness. This approach balances apologetic clarity with doxological aim, letting **Scripture** set the terms of the quest while refusing both fideist retreat and rationalist domestication. The picture of **Christ** is at once **creedal** and evangelistically potent, a model of constructive **evangelical** Christology in a pluralist setting.

#### 6. The Devil’s Redemption: the genealogy and critique of universalism
The center of McClymond’s public profile is **The Devil’s Redemption** 2018, a two-volume history and interpretation of **Christian universalism**. He defines the field by distinguishing the universal range of the **atonement’s sufficiency** from the dogmatic claim that all rational creatures will be saved, the latter labeled *apokatastasis*. The historical narrative tracks **Origen**, **Gregory of Nyssa**, and **Evagrius** in late antiquity; medieval dissenters and mystics; early modern **theosophy** in **Jacob Boehme**, **Jane Leade**, **William Law**, and **Friedrich Christoph Oetinger**; philosophical **idealism** in **F. W. J. Schelling** and **G. W. F. Hegel**; modern theology in **Friedrich Schleiermacher**, **Karl Barth**, and **Hans Urs von Balthasar**; and contemporary advocates including **George MacDonald**, **Thomas Talbott**, **Robin Parry**, **Ilaria Ramelli**, and to popular audiences **Rob Bell**. McClymond’s genealogical claim is that dogmatic universalism recurrently correlates with **esoteric metaphysics**, **monistic** or **emanationist** schemes, and a corresponding attenuation of **sin**, **divine wrath**, and the moral seriousness of **hell**.

#### 7. Dogmatic judgments on hell, freedom, and divine love
On dogmatics McClymond argues that universalism destabilizes four evangelical pillars. First, the nature of **evil** is morally thinned if final destiny is guaranteed by metaphysical necessity rather than adjudicated in the **Last Judgment**. Second, **human agency** is compromised when divine **grace** is construed as coercively irresistible in a way that drowns created freedom rather than heals and elevates it. Third, **divine love** becomes a metaphysical absolute detached from **holiness** and **justice**, eclipsing the biblical symphony of **mercy** and **wrath**. Fourth, **mission** is undermined if the urgency of **repentance** and faith is eschatologically neutralized. He presses abundant **Scripture** on eternal punishment, including **Matthew 25**, **Mark 9**, **2 Thessalonians 1**, **Jude**, and **Revelation 20**, and he highlights how readings of *apokatastasis* often allegorize or relativize this witness. In sustained treatments of **Barth** and **Balthasar**, McClymond contends that the former’s doctrine of **election** trends toward effective universalism, and that the latter’s doctrine of **hope** risks practical universal confidence detached from biblical constraints.

#### 8. Interlocutors, counter-arguments, and theological stakes
McClymond engages universalist rejoinders with care, granting the real pastoral pull of **divine mercy** while contending that mercy as Scripture displays it is cruciform, covenantal, and not a generalized cosmic optimism. He challenges **Ilaria Ramelli’s** reconstruction of patristic *apokatastasis* as centrally orthodox, arguing that **Augustine**, **the Latin West**, and conciliar trajectories do not sustain a universalist consensus. He disputes contemporary defenses by **Thomas Talbott** and **Robin Parry** as predicated on either a priori philosophical commitments or on exegetical harmonizations that mute **apocalyptic duality**. He aligns instead with **Augustinian** accounts of **predestination** that protect both **divine freedom** and meaningful **reprobation** while maintaining evangelical assurance in **Christ**. The moral texture of his position stresses the gravity of **idolatry** and **iniquity**, the necessity of **new birth**, and the integrity of **sanctification**. His broader claim is that universalism tends to smuggle in **gnostic** or **idealistic** premises that displace the concrete, covenantal, and judicial dimensions of the **gospel**.

#### 9. Contribution and synthesis
Taken as a whole, McClymond’s corpus offers a double gift to contemporary theology. In **Edwards** he retrieves a richly **Trinitarian** and aesthetic **Reformed** spirituality that binds **affections** to doctrine and doxology to discipleship, showing how **beauty** and **glory** can deepen rather than dilute confessional clarity. In **The Devil’s Redemption** he supplies a panoramic map of **universalism**, arguing that its strongest forms arise where **metaphysics** outruns **exegesis**, and where historical streams of **theosophy** and **idealism** blend with modern humanitarian sentiment. His **Christology** in **Familiar Stranger** rounds out the picture by demonstrating how **historical Jesus** work can be responsibly harnessed to **creedal** confession. Throughout, McClymond exemplifies evangelical ressourcement: bold retrieval, granular history, and unembarrassed dogmatics that call the church back to **judgment**, **grace**, and **mission** centered on **Jesus Christ**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and Westminster Seminary perspective, McClymond’s anti-universalist stance and his Edwardsian retrieval align with **Westminster Confession** commitments to **particular redemption**, **effectual calling**, **final judgment**, and the twofold outcome of **resurrection**. His reading of **Scripture** by *analogia fidei* and his alertness to **gnostic** tendencies in modern theologies resonate with a **covenantal** critique of speculative metaphysics. Two cautions follow. First, the genealogical strategy can appear to overdetermine complex figures such as **Gregory of Nyssa**, **Barth**, or **Balthasar**, at times conflating a chastened **hope** with dogmatic **apokatastasis**, where a Reformed alternative would distinguish sharply between God’s revealed will in **covenant** and his hidden counsel, maintaining the asymmetry of election and reprobation under **divine freedom**. Second, a Westminster trajectory would press even more explicitly the doctrines of **federal headship**, **union with Christ**, and **covenantal sanctions** in articulating **hell** and **heaven**, framing eschatology by the two ages and the **means of grace** rather than by metaphysical necessity. Even so, McClymond’s project strengthens evangelical confidence in **judgment** and **mercy**, offers a robustly **Reformed** account of **Edwards**, and equips pastors and scholars to resist the drift of modern **universalism** with exegetical rigor and catholic charity.
