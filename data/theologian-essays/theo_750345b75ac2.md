### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Heath A. Thomas emerges as a **contemporary evangelical** Old Testament theologian situated within the renewal of **theological interpretation of Scripture** that matured after **Brevard Childs** and alongside the interventions of **Daniel J. Treier** and **Kevin J. Vanhoozer**. Educated in Old Testament and engaged in ecclesial institutions associated with Baptist life in North America and the UK, by the early 2010s he had already contributed substantively to debates on **lament**, **canon**, and **divine violence**. His later administrative and teaching roles, culminating in leadership at **Oklahoma Baptist University** in 2019, kept his academic work tethered to **churchly formation**, confirming a method that reads Scripture as the church’s book. The methodological center of gravity in Thomas is a canonical and ecclesial hermeneutic that refuses **Marcionism**, insists on the unity of **Old and New Testaments**, and frames exegesis within the **regula fidei** without abandoning philology and historical study.

Thomas’s hermeneutic discloses a dual loyalty: an evangelical confidence in **Scripture as divine discourse** and a postcritical sapiential posture toward **literary poetics** and **aesthetics**. He engages **Paul Ricoeur** on symbol and narrative and **Umberto Eco** on the *open work* to describe how biblical texts, especially **Lamentations**, generate theological meaning through polyvalent form. Yet his appropriation is disciplined by the **canon** and **Christological telos**, a stance akin to **Childs** and **Seitz** in canonical orientation and to **Vanhoozer** in insistence that theology is accountable to **divine communicative action**. The corollary is a practical orientation: Thomas treats **lament** and **hope** not merely as topics but as modes of ecclesial **prayer**, **worship**, and **mission**, situating exegesis within the *habitus* of the people of God.

#### 2. Lament as covenant faith
The signal contribution of Thomas’s scholarship is a constructive retrieval of **lament** as covenantal faith, a theme developed across his editorial and monographic work, including **Great Is Thy Faithfulness? Reading Lamentations as Sacred Scripture** in 2011 and his monograph **Poetry and Theology in Lamentations: The Aesthetics of an Open Text** in 2013. Against thin apologetic or triumphalist piety, he argues that **lament** is a faithful protest that presupposes **YHWH’s covenant hesed** and **tsedeq**, bringing Israel’s pain into the court of God through **liturgical complaint**, **confession**, and **petition**. For Thomas, the practice of lament enacts a thick doctrine of God’s **justice and mercy**, resisting utilitarian theodicies while refusing nihilistic despair. The textual anchor is the poetics of **Lamentations** and **Psalms of lament**, where he highlights formal features such as acrostics, parallelism, and communal voice as theological vehicles of **hope amid exile**.

This account serves an ecclesial telos: churches that recover **lament as prayer** become communities schooled in patience, discernment, and **eschatological hope**. Thomas aligns here with **Walter Brueggemann’s** emphasis on Israel’s *counter-speech*, yet he recalibrates Brueggemann’s program by pressing **canonical coherence** and **Christological fulfillment**. For Thomas, **Lamentations 3** with its confession of **YHWH’s steadfast love** becomes a canonical hinge that is taken up in the **cross and resurrection**, where Israel’s exile is borne by the **Messiah**. The result is a cruciform theodicy: the God who judges Israel’s sin is the God who bears Israel’s judgment, rendering **lament** both truthful speech and anticipatory hope.

#### 3. Poetics, aesthetics, and theological interpretation
Thomas’s methodological signature, on display in **Poetry and Theology in Lamentations: The Aesthetics of an Open Text** in 2013, is the integration of **literary poetics** and **theological interpretation of Scripture**. The notion of an **open text** is not license for interpretive anarchy but an account of how biblical poetry’s indirection and density invite the reader into a disciplined process of meaning-making within the **canon**. He appropriates **Eco’s** category of openness and **Ricoeur’s** theory of symbol to argue that **aesthetic form** is a medium of **theological content**, so that features like acrostic structure and strategic silence are not merely literary devices but disclosures of **divine presence and hiddenness**. This leads to a hermeneutic where **form and doctrine** are mutually implicative: poetic reticence trains the church to wait upon **God’s timing**, and textual fragmentation inculcates a spirituality of **contestation and hope**.

In editorial projects like **A Manifesto for Theological Interpretation** in 2016, Thomas articulates a programmatic vision for reading **Scripture within the church**, under the **rule of faith**, and for the sake of **formation**. He aligns with a cohort of evangelicals who seek to move beyond historicist reduction or purely reader-response accounts, recovering **doctrinal exegesis** without surrendering **historical-critical** tools. His essays and collaborations make the case that **Scripture’s ontology** as divine address grounds an integrative method: exegesis, dogmatics, and spirituality coinhere, and the proper end of biblical theology is **wisdom for the church**.

#### 4. Habakkuk, faith, and theodicy
Thomas’s 2018 **Two Horizons Old Testament Commentary** on **Habakkuk** exemplifies his mature synthesis of exegesis and theology. The text’s crisis of **theodicy** and **divine justice** is handled through close reading of the prophet’s **complaints**, **vision**, and the interpretive fulcrum in **Habakkuk 2:4** concerning the **righteous living by faith or faithfulness**. Thomas welds philological care to doctrinal reflection on **faith**, **God’s patience**, and **judgment**, showing how Habakkuk authorizes faithful waiting amid the dissonance of history. He reads **Habakkuk’s watchtower** stance as a model of **ecclesial vigilance**, where lament is not resignation but expectancy rooted in **YHWH’s appointed time**.

Canonical connections are explicit: Thomas correlates **Habakkuk 2:4** with **Pauline** usage in **Romans** and **Galatians**, tracing a line from prophetic **emunah** to apostolic **pistis** and Christian **perseverance**. Yet he resists flattening the prophetic into a mere prooftext for **justification**, preserving the prophetic book’s witness to **covenant fidelity**, **divine sovereignty**, and **ethical endurance**. The commentary’s Two Horizons architecture allows him to move from textual analysis to **theological horizons**, where he advances theses on **God’s holiness**, **evil**, and **hope** that are consonant with his larger project on **lament** as honest faith before the holy God.

#### 5. Minor Prophets and canonical theology
In **The Minor Prophets: A Theological Introduction** in 2018, co-authored with **Mark J. Boda** and **Andrew T. Abernethy**, Thomas contributes to a collective presentation of the **Book of the Twelve** that foregrounds themes of **judgment**, **mercy**, **mission**, and **kingdom** within a canonical frame. The project is paradigmatic of his approach: to gather discrete prophetic witnesses into a coherent **theological symphony** where motifs of **exile and return**, **day of the Lord**, and **covenant renewal** are coordinated toward **Christological fulfillment**. The volume’s emphasis on how the Twelve shape the church’s **ethics** and **worship** reflects Thomas’s conviction that biblical theology must terminate in ecclesial **practice**.

Thomas’s editorial and pedagogical work consistently underscores **canon** and **rule of faith** as the architecture for theological reading. His contributions to essay collections and conferences locate him among those who perceive **biblical theology** as a bridge discipline, mediating between **exegesis** and **dogmatics**, with the **prophets** as privileged teachers of divine **justice** and **mercy**. Here his conversation partners include **Christopher J. H. Wright** on mission and ethics and **John Goldingay** on Old Testament theology, even as Thomas presses a more explicit **ecclesial teleology** and **Christological consummation** than some of his interlocutors.

#### 6. Divine violence, herem, and moral reason
A notable strand of Thomas’s public-facing scholarship appears in the 2013 edited volume **Holy War in the Bible: Christian Morality and an Old Testament Problem**, co-edited with **Paul Copan** and **Jeremy A. Evans**. There Thomas participates in a spectrum of evangelical responses to **divine violence** and **herem** in **Joshua** and elsewhere, arguing that the moral problem must be faced canonically, historically, and theologically. He resists simplistic harmonizations and rejects both **Marcionite** dismissal and apologetic denial. The ethical logic he favors is salvation-historical and covenantal: Israel’s **holy war** is a time-bound instrument of **divine judgment** and **purification**, framed by **YHWH’s justice** and directed toward **redemptive purposes** that culminate in **Christ’s cross** and the advent of **enemy love**.

In engagement with **philosophical ethics**, Thomas affirms that divine command must be read within the **character of God** and the **economy of covenant history**, not abstracted into timeless prescriptions. He draws on **just war** criteria and the category of **intrusion** implicit in certain Reformed accounts, even if not always explicitly labeled, to argue that Israel’s warfare signifies an inbreaking of eschatological **judgment** into history. Crucially, Thomas insists that the church’s **ethic** after Christ is non-identical with Israel’s conquest mandate; the trajectory from **herem** to **Golgotha** reframes power, justice, and victory. Thus the hermeneutical key is canonical: **violence** is interpreted through **judgment-unto-mercy** and **cross-shaped kingship**, a stance that preserves divine **holiness** while sustaining **gospel** proclamation.

#### 7. Scripture, church, and theological pedagogy
Beyond monographs and edited volumes, Thomas functions as a theological educator who advances **theological interpretation of Scripture** as a pedagogical program for **church and academy**. In both scholarly and popular venues he stresses **Scripture’s ontology** as **divine address**, its ecclesial home under **canon** and **creed**, and its formative aim in **discipleship**. He resists methodological partitions that segregate **historical criticism**, **biblical theology**, and **systematics**, contending that a properly evangelical practice of reading will hold these in ordered relation under the **rule of faith**. His advocacy for **lament** as a habit in corporate worship, pastoral care, and mission shows how **doctrine** is enacted in **liturgy**, a theme he amplifies by drawing from **Psalter** practice, prophetic **rib** litigation, and New Testament patterns of **groaning hope**.

Theologically, Thomas’s approach to **God**, **evil**, and **hope** is marked by the conviction that Scripture trains the church to speak truthfully of **divine justice** without collapsing into speculative **theodicy**. The grammar is cruciform and eschatological: the God whose **holiness** burns against sin bears that judgment in the **Son**, and the Spirit tutors the church in **patience** as it awaits **new creation**. This confessional stance is not ancillary to interpretation; it is the precondition for hearing Scripture’s voice. In this way Thomas embodies an evangelical ressourcement wherein **poetics**, **canon**, and **creed** converge to nourish a church that can both **lament** and **hope** with integrity.

#### 8. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Thomas’s work is a welcome and substantial ally on several fronts. His robust **canonical** hermeneutic, resistance to **Marcionism**, and insistence that **Old Testament** is **Christian Scripture** accord with **Vosian** redemptive-historical method and **Calvin’s** pastoral use of the **Psalter** to school the church in **lament**. His cruciform construal of **theodicy**, covenantal framing of **herem**, and ecclesial teleology in the **prophets** resonate with confessional instincts about **law and gospel**, **judgment and mercy**, and the unity of the **covenant of grace**. Yet several tensions invite sharpening. First, the aesthetics of an **open text** must be consistently tethered to **analogia fidei** and **analogia Scripturae** so that literary openness does not drift into indeterminacy; here **Bavinck’s** and **Turretin’s** strictures on doctrinal clarity and Scripture’s perspicuity can anchor poetics in dogmatics. Second, Thomas’s embrace of **divine pathos** as a biblical idiom needs explicit exposition within **classical theism** to safeguard **divine simplicity** and **impassibility**, perhaps following **John Webster** or recent retrievals that parse anthropopathic language as accommodated discourse rather than metaphysical revision. Third, on **divine violence**, Thomas’s covenantal frame can be strengthened by explicit appeal to **intrusion ethics** as articulated by **Meredith Kline**, which better secures the non-identity of Israel’s war and the church’s vocation while preserving **God’s justice**. Finally, the Christological arc from **prophets** to **gospel** would benefit from a clearer account of **typology** grounded in covenantal ontology rather than mere literary figuration, reinforcing that **Christ** fulfills Israel not only narratively but **ontologically** as the telos of **creation and covenant**. With these clarifications, Thomas’s project stands as a valued partner for confessional Reformed theology: rigorous in **exegesis**, rich in **ecclesial wisdom**, and disciplined by **canon** toward the praise of the **triune God**.
