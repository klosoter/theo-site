### TITLE
Athanasius secures the churchs confession that the Son is *homoousios* with the Father, so that only the truly divine Christ can truly save.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Athanasius of Alexandria** (c. 296–373) ministered in the heat of the fourth century **Arian controversy**, shaped by the **Council of Nicaea** 325 and its aftermath in the Christianized Roman Empire.
- As bishop of **Alexandria** under emperors from **Constantine** to **Valens**, he fought shifting imperial theologies and emerging **Nicene** and semi-Arian factions across the Eastern Mediterranean.

- Athanasius reasons from the **Scriptures** read within the **churchs rule of faith**, arguing that exegesis must preserve the worship and salvation actually practiced in the church.
- His theology is deeply **Christocentric** and soteriological, moving from the work of **Christ** back to the being of God, with a polemical, pastoral, and doxological tone.
- He employs **Platonic** and Middle Platonic concepts about participation and incorruptibility, yet subordinates **philosophy** to the revealed identity of the **Logos** in Scripture.

- In **On the Incarnation** (c. 318–335), he argues that only the **incarnate Word**, consubstantial with the Father, can restore corrupt humanity and conquer death.
- In **Orations Against the Arians** (c. 339–345), he defends the **eternality and consubstantiality** of the Son and offers extensive exegesis against **Arius** and the Eusebian party.
- In **Letter to Serapion** (c. 359–360), he extends Nicene logic to the **Holy Spirit**, arguing that the Spirit is also truly God and distinct from creatures.
- In **Festal Letter 39** (367), he provides an early list of the **New Testament canon**, aligning the churchs Scripture with Nicene faith.

- His primary doctrinal impact is on the **doctrine of the Trinity**, especially the relation of the Son and Spirit to the Father in light of salvation.
- He is decisive for **Christology and soteriology**, grounding salvation from death and corruption in the incarnate consubstantial **Logos**.
- He contributes to **revelation and Scripture**, especially the canonical shape of Scripture and its Nicene reading within the church.
- He shapes **ecclesiology**, modeling the bishop as guardian of orthodoxy against imperially sponsored heresy and intra-ecclesial compromise.

- A Westminster examiner will want you to affirm Athanasius as the great defender of **Nicene Trinitarianism**, while carefully distinguishing his orthodox core from later Eastern **theosis** trajectories.
- The committee will press you to relate **Athanasius** to **Reformed confessions**, showing how his *homoousios* and soteriology undergird doctrines of **penal substitution**, union with Christ, and Trinitarian worship.

- Under pressure, compare **Athanasius vs Arius** on the Son as creator or creature, and **Athanasius vs the Cappadocians** on persons and essence in the **Trinity**.
- Also bring in **Athanasius vs Augustine** on Trinitarian taxis and **Athanasius vs Calvin** on the knowledge of God and the relation of **Scripture** to church tradition.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**Athanasius of Alexandria** was born around 296, likely in Alexandria, and became deacon under Bishop **Alexander of Alexandria** during the early phases of the **Arian controversy**. He attended the **Council of Nicaea** in 325 as Alexanders secretary, then succeeded him as bishop in 328. Over the next decades he endured at least five exiles under shifting imperial policies from **Constantine**, **Constantius II**, **Julian**, and **Valens**. His ministry unfolded as the church transitioned from persecuted minority to imperially supported institution, which intensified theological conflicts over the identity of the **Son of God**.

The driving problem of Athanasius theology is soteriological and doxological: what must be true of Christ and of God for Christian worship and salvation to be genuine. Against **Arianism**, represented by **Arius** and the **Eusebian** alliance, he contends that if the Son is a creature, then he cannot truly reveal the Father nor effect salvation from sin and death. For Athanasius, the stakes are nothing less than whether Christians worship a creature and whether the **gospel** is emptied of power. His entire corpus, from **On the Incarnation** to the **Orations Against the Arians**, is structured by the conviction that only if the Son is **homoousios** with the Father, sharing the same divine essence, can believers be united to God and restored from corruption.

Athanasius is formed within Alexandrian **exegetical and philosophical** traditions, influenced by **Origen** yet sharply critical where Origen seemed to jeopardize the full deity of the Son. He inherits Alexandrias love of allegory and Platonically tinged metaphysics of participation, yet wields these in service to the Nicene confession. Theologically, he lives in a world where defining orthodoxy requires councils and creeds, yet where emperors and bishops often weaponize doctrine for political ends. His experience of repeated exile convinces him that the **churchs confession** cannot be negotiated for peace or imperial favor, but must be guarded even by a minority when necessary.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Athanasius method begins with **Scripture** as the unique authoritative revelation of the **Logos**. He reads Scripture within the **rule of faith** and the confession of Nicaea, insisting that true interpretation must preserve the churchs worship of the Son and the experienced power of salvation. In **Orations Against the Arians**, he repeatedly charges Arius with misreading texts like **Proverbs 8** and **Colossians 1** because they abstract verses from the overall Scriptural witness to the eternal Son. For Athanasius, revelation is not a set of bare propositions, but the self-disclosure of the **Word** in the economy of creation and redemption, normatively attested in the canonical Scriptures.

Reason has a real but subordinate role in Athanasius. He uses **philosophical** terminology, including participation, incorruptibility, and immutability, yet constantly affirms that the identity of **Christ** given in Scripture corrects and purifies philosophical speculation. In **Against the Heathen** and **On the Incarnation**, he critiques pagan philosophers for knowing some truths about God as creator through the world, yet failing to know God personally as Father of the **Word**. Thus, natural reason discloses that there is a divine source and that idolatry is irrational, but only revelation in Christ and Scripture provides saving knowledge of God. In this sense he anticipates a **Reformed** emphasis on the clarity of general revelation and the necessity of special revelation while operating with a different conceptual apparatus.

Experience and history function as confirmations of revelation rather than as independent sources. Athanasius often appeals to the transformation of believers and the defeat of paganism as evidence of the divinity of **Christ**. In **On the Incarnation**, he notes that the spread of the gospel and the breaking of the power of demons show that the crucified and risen **Word** is truly Lord. The life of the **church** and the endurance of the Nicene minority under persecution demonstrate to him the reliability of the Nicene faith. Yet he never grants church decisions infallible status apart from Scripture; rather, councils like **Nicaea** are authoritative because they faithfully summarize the biblical testimony about the Son.

There are some tensions with classical **Reformed** method. Athanasius confidence in the Nicene formula *homoousios* as a sort of hermeneutical key risks, from a later perspective, giving a dogmatic term near canonical status. His exegesis sometimes reflects Alexandrian allegorical habits, for example his reading of **Psalm 110** and **Proverbs 8**, in ways that a Reformed grammatico-historical exegesis would question. Nevertheless, his basic pattern of arguing from Scripture, read in light of the gospel and the churchs doxology, fits well with the **Westminster** view that Scripture interprets Scripture and that doctrine must serve the worship of the triune God.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

The classic baseline for the **Trinity** is that there is one God in three distinct persons, coequal and coeternal, as later summarized by the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed and codified in **Reformed confessions**. Athanasius contribution is to secure the full deity of the Son, and implicitly the Spirit, at the level of ousia. In the **Orations Against the Arians**, he argues that the Son is begotten, not made, and shares the same **divine essence** as the Father. His opponent **Arius** had taught that the Son was the first and greatest creature, made from nothing. Athanasius counters that if the Son does the works of God, such as creating and sustaining all things, and if baptism is into the name of Father, Son, and **Holy Spirit**, then the Son must be true God. His language of eternal generation preserves both distinction and equality: the Father is unbegotten, the Son begotten, yet both share the same *homoousios*. In the **Letters to Serapion**, Athanasius extends this logic to the Spirit: if the Spirit deifies believers, he cannot be a creature, but must be truly God with the Father and the Son. Here he anticipates the later fully developed **Nicene**-Cappadocian doctrine of the Trinity.

For **Christology and soteriology**, the confessional baseline is that the eternal Son assumed a true human nature for our salvation, with one person in two natures, as later defined at **Chalcedon** and embraced by Reformed orthodoxy. Athanasius, writing before Chalcedon, does not articulate the Chalcedonian formula, yet he lays crucial foundations. In **On the Incarnation**, he presents a robust account of the Word made flesh: the same divine **Logos** who created the world assumes our humanity in order to restore the image of God and defeat death. His key axiom is that what is not assumed is not healed, a principle later echoed by **Gregory of Nazianzus**. The driving argument is that only God can save, and since salvation consists in deliverance from corruption and union with God, the Savior must be the true **God-man**. He argues against Arians and implicit adoptionists that if Christ were a mere man or a high creature, our union with God would be impossible. Although he tends to speak of the incarnate subject simply as the Word, his insistence on the real humanity of Christ, subject to hunger, fear, and growth, prevents a docetic reading and prepares the way for later hypostatic union formulations.

Regarding **revelation and Scripture**, the Reformed baseline is that Scripture alone is the inspired, sufficient, and final authority for faith and life, the only infallible rule, though the churchs creeds have subordinate authority. Athanasius is one of the earliest sources to list the New Testament canon substantially as we have it. In **Festal Letter 39** (367), he enumerates the twenty-seven books and distinguishes them from other ecclesiastical writings, such as the **Shepherd of Hermas**, which may be read for edification but are not canonical. He argues that these writings, given by the **Spirit**, uniquely norm doctrine and worship. His use of Scripture in polemics against Arius is relentless; he repeatedly insists that the Arians twist Scripture and that the **Nicene Creed** is a faithful summary of scriptural teaching. His canonical judgment becomes a key witness in later patristic and medieval discussions, and **Reformed** theologians often appeal to him when defending the New Testament canon and the sufficiency of Scripture.

On **church and grace**, the confessional baseline is that the church is the body of Christ, the ordinary sphere of salvation, yet its ministers and councils can err and must be corrected by Scripture, and that salvation is by grace alone, through faith, grounded in Christs finished work. Athanasius sees the **church** as the place where the Nicene faith is confessed and preserved, and he portrays himself as the embattled bishop defending apostolic teaching against both imperial pressure and internal compromise. His letters from exile stress that communion with the true bishops who confess the **homoousios** is communion with the apostolic church. On grace and salvation, his emphasis falls heavily on union with the deifying **Word**. In **On the Incarnation** and his festal letters, he speaks of believers being made sons by adoption and participation in the Son, using the language of **theosis** or deification. Grace for Athanasius is not merely pardon but restoration and participation in Gods life. Though he does not develop later Western categories of merit, satisfaction, or forensic justification, his conviction that salvation is entirely a work of the divine **Christ** aligns with the Reformed insistence on the monergistic character of grace, even if framed in different terms.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Classical **Reformed** theologians have typically hailed Athanasius as a hero of orthodoxy. **Calvin** in the Institutes speaks approvingly of the Nicene Fathers, including Athanasius, for safeguarding the full deity of the Son. **Turretin** and later **Bavinck** view Athanasius as a key witness for the doctrine of eternal generation and the consubstantial Trinity. The Reformed confessions, such as the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, adopt Nicene and Chalcedonian categories, and in doing so they implicitly receive Athanasian Trinitarianism and Christology. **Vos** and **Van Til** appreciate Athanasius insistence that only if the Son is truly God can He truly reveal God and accomplish redemption, a structure that resonates with Reformed emphasis on the self-attesting **Christ** of Scripture and the impossibility of neutral reasoning about God.

There are, however, points where a Westminster examiner must register caution. First, Athanasius use of **theosis** language, though not developed as later Eastern synergism, can be misheard as collapsing the Creator creature distinction or as implying an ontological deification that Reformed theology would deny. One must emphasize that for Athanasius, deification is participatory and by grace, not an absorption into the divine essence. Second, his emphasis on the incarnate Word overcoming corruption and death sometimes overshadows themes of guilt and wrath, and he does not articulate **penal substitution** in later Reformed terms. A Reformed candidate should affirm the ontological and participatory dimensions of salvation that Athanasius highlights while insisting that Scripture also teaches a legal, forensic dimension that must not be minimized.

On the positive side, Reformed theologians can learn from Athanasius relentless Christocentrism and his refusal to separate **Trinity** from **soteriology**. His argument that only the consubstantial Son can save grounds Trinitarian dogma in pastoral and evangelistic necessity, which fits well with **Westminster** catechetical patterns that tie doctrine to comfort and assurance. His canonical awareness, as in **Festal Letter 39**, also offers a patristic anchor for Reformed doctrines of Scripture. In summary, Reformed orthodoxy stands squarely with Athanasius in defense of Nicene Trinitarianism and robust incarnation, while supplementing his soteriology with stronger forensic and covenantal categories.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, it is safe to open with a sentence like this: **Athanasius is the fourth century bishop of Alexandria whose central claim is that only the consubstantial Son can truly save, so Nicene Trinitarianism is simply the grammar of the gospel.** That line immediately signals that you grasp his historical location, his role in the **Arian controversy**, and the soteriological stakes of his doctrine of the **Trinity**. It is also safe to say that he is a key patristic witness for the New Testament **canon**, especially through Festal Letter 39, and that later Reformed theologians receive him as a foundational figure for orthodox Trinitarian and Christological dogma.

You should avoid unqualified phrases like **Athanasius teaches theosis just like later Eastern Orthodoxy**, or **Athanasius is primarily concerned with mystical deification**, because examiners will press you on whether he compromises the **Creator creature distinction** or shifts salvation away from legal justification. If you use **theosis** or deification language, immediately qualify it by saying that for Athanasius believers participate by grace in the life of the **triune God**, without becoming divine by nature, and that this participatory frame must be supplemented by Reformed doctrines of imputed righteousness and forensic justification. Avoid saying that Athanasius offers a fully developed doctrine of the **hypostatic union**; instead, say that he prepares the way for Chalcedon by insisting on the real humanity and full deity of the one incarnate **Word**.

Examiners may exploit common misunderstandings, such as the notion that Athanasius simply repeats **Origen** or that he is one theologian among many at Nicaea rather than the decisive Nicene champion in the decades that followed. Be clear that he both inherits and corrects Origen, especially on the eternity of the **Son**. Another frequent misunderstanding is that Athanasius focuses only on ontology and not on Scripture. You should emphasize that the **Orations Against the Arians** are extended exegetical arguments rooted in biblical texts, and that ontology in Athanasius is driven by scriptural exegesis and soteriology. Finally, some students treat Athanasius as if he had a fully Western doctrine of **atonement**, which examiners may challenge; you should acknowledge that his focus is on victory over death and restoration from corruption, then show how this can be integrated with, though not reduced to, Reformed emphases on satisfaction and propitiation.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, Athanasius is to be strongly affirmed as the principal patristic defender of **Nicene Trinitarianism** and of the full deity and true humanity of the **incarnate Word**, since our Reformed confessions stand squarely within the Nicene and Chalcedonian stream he helped establish; we must deny any reading of Athanasius that would blur the **Creator creature distinction**, make deification an ontological upgrading of human nature, or treat his participatory soteriology as a substitute for the biblical doctrines of guilt, wrath, and forensic justification, yet we should gladly receive his profound insight that only the consubstantial Son can unite us to God and conquer death, and we should integrate his themes of participation, incorruptibility, and victory over death with our doctrines of union with Christ, penal substitution, and adoption, so that if asked where we land we can say that we stand with **Athanasius** on the Trinity and incarnation, while reading his soteriology through and beyond him in the fuller light of **Reformed** confessional teaching.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- **Athanasius of Alexandria** is the fourth century Nicene bishop who insisted that only the consubstantial Son can truly save, so the Trinity is the grammar of the gospel.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- Around 296–373, **Athanasius** serves in Alexandria, attends **Nicaea** in 325, and spends much of his episcopate in exile resisting Arian and semi-Arian pressures.
- In **On the Incarnation** (c. 318–335), he argues that the eternal **Logos** became man to restore the image of God and conquer death and corruption.
- In **Festal Letter 39** (367), Athanasius lists the twenty-seven book **New Testament canon**, distinguishing canonical Scripture from other ecclesiastical writings.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- Athanasius reads **Scripture** as the supreme authority within the **churchs rule of faith**, using the Nicene *homoousios* as a hermeneutical safeguard for exegesis.
- He uses **reason and philosophy** in a subordinate way, allowing the revealed identity of the **Word** to correct pagan and Platonic conceptions of God.
- He appeals to the history of the **church** and the transformation of believers as confirmations that the crucified and risen **Christ** is truly God.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- Against **Arius**, Athanasius defends the eternal generation and **consubstantiality** of the Son, insisting that the Son is true God from true God.
- In **On the Incarnation**, he grounds salvation in the incarnate **Word**, arguing that what is not assumed is not healed and that only God can overcome death and corruption.
- Through **Letters to Serapion**, he extends Nicene logic to the **Holy Spirit**, arguing that the Spirit who deifies cannot be a creature but must be truly God.
- In **Festal Letter 39**, he articulates a practical doctrine of **canon**, identifying the books that uniquely norm doctrine and worship in the church.
- He presents salvation as participatory **theosis**, believers becoming sons by grace through union with the Son, while still maintaining the Creator creature distinction.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press how Athanasius participatory **theosis** language relates to **Reformed** doctrines of justification and the Creator creature distinction.
- They will question whether Athanasius focus on corruption and death sufficiently includes themes of **guilt, wrath, and penal substitution** as developed in Reformed soteriology.
- They may challenge his occasional **allegorical exegesis** and his strong reliance on the Nicene formula as a hermeneutical key in light of grammatico-historical method.
- They will expect clarity that while Athanasius is a canonical witness to **Trinitarian** and Christological orthodoxy, his theology is not a complete model for Reformed systematics.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Athanasius vs Arius** contrasts the consubstantial Son who is creator and savior with a highest creature who cannot reveal or redeem.
- **Athanasius vs the Cappadocians** contrasts his soteriologically driven defense of the Son and Spirit with their more formal refinement of **person and essence** language.
- **Athanasius vs Augustine** highlights differing accounts of Trinitarian relations and psychological analogies, East and West, within a shared **Nicene** faith.
- **Athanasius vs Calvin** compares Athanasius Christocentric, participatory soteriology with Calvins integration of union with Christ and **forensic justification**.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- From a Westminster stance, **Athanasius** is a foundational ally for Nicene Trinity and incarnation whose participatory soteriology we gratefully receive yet must consciously complete with fully articulated **Reformed** doctrines of guilt, grace, and justification.
