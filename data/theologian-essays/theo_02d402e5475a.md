### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and vocation
James M. Hamilton Jr. emerged within the **contemporary evangelical** consolidation around **inerrancy** and canonical unity that reshaped American Protestant scholarship in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Trained within the **Southern Baptist** ecosystem, with doctoral work completed at **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary** and early influence from figures like **Thomas R. Schreiner**, **D. A. Carson**, and **G. K. Beale**, Hamilton’s scholarship grows from a church-facing posture that marries **biblical theology** to **expository preaching** and pastoral catechesis. As Professor of **Biblical Theology** at Southern Seminary and as a preaching pastor at **Kenwood Baptist Church** in Louisville, he inhabits a dual calling that presses his academic theses into ecclesial service. The intellectual horizon of his work is framed by debate with **Brevard Childs’s canonical approach**, **James Barr’s** criticism of biblical theology as theology, and **Walter Brueggemann’s** rhetorical pluralism, while drawing constructive energy from **Graeme Goldsworthy’s** salvation-historical method and **G. K. Beale’s** intertextual readings. The result is a distinctively **evangelical** proposal: one canon, two testaments, a single **divine Author** who communicates **glory** through a **Christ-centered** drama discerned by careful attention to **intertextuality** and **typology**.

#### 2. Method: Canon, authorial intent, and typological patterning
Hamilton’s methodological posture is explicit: the Bible is God’s speech in human words, so **authorial intent** must be construed at two levels, the human and the **divine Author**, with the latter ensuring canonical coherence and *sensus plenior* that remains textually anchored. He contends that **biblical theology** is the attempt to read the whole canon according to its own narrative, symbols, and summaries, which he distills through **intertextual allusion**, **chiastic structures**, and recurring **motifs** such as the **seed of the woman**, the **exodus** pattern, and the **temple presence**. Against **free allegory**, he advances **typology** as God-ordained, prospective patterning in history, discernible by textual signals as patterns form and are later fulfilled in **Christ**. With **Luke 24** and **2 Timothy 3:16** as anchor texts, Hamilton frames Scripture as a coherent, salvation-historical plot moving from **creation** to **new creation**. His hermeneutical commitments are unapologetically **inerrantist**, canonical, and ecclesially accountable, over against **postcritical figuralism** that brackets authorial intent. In this, he stands near **Goldsworthy** and **Beale**, while offering correctives to **Childs’s** sometimes open-ended canonical shaping and to **Richard Hays’s** poetic figuralism by insisting on verifiable **intertextual triggers**.

#### 3. Programmatic thesis: God’s glory in salvation through judgment
Hamilton’s signature contribution, **God’s Glory in Salvation through Judgment** (2010), proposes a single, integrated center for **biblical theology**: God magnifies his **glory** by saving a people through judging sin, death, and the serpent, a pattern that structures the entire canon. He argues that this formula discloses the **Noahic flood** as both undoing and re-creation, the **exodus** as deliverance forged through the **Passover** and the Red Sea’s judgment, the **exile** and **return** as purifying discipline unto restoration, and climactically the **cross** as the locus where justice and mercy meet and the **resurrection** as vindicatory judgment and salvation. The work proceeds book by book, drawing out each biblical unit’s contribution to the theme, while maintaining attention to **covenant** administration, **kingdom** development, and the **temple** motif. Responding to the dismissal of a single center by **James Barr** and the multiplex centers proposed by other evangelicals, Hamilton contends that his thesis is theologically warranted by **divine simplicity** and exegetically grounded in Scripture’s self-presentation of **glory** as the telos of **salvation** manifested through **judgment**. The result is a bold, unifying claim designed to stabilize **canonical unity** and expand **pastoral preaching** with doxological focus.

#### 4. Spirit and temple: God’s Indwelling Presence and the new covenant
In **God’s Indwelling Presence** (2006), Hamilton develops the **temple presence** theme by arguing for a decisive shift in **Spirit** indwelling between the old and new covenants. He maintains that the Old Testament anticipates permanent, universal indwelling in passages like **Ezekiel 36** and **Joel 2**, but that the experiential reality awaits the **new covenant** events of **Christ’s glorification** and **Pentecost** per **John 7:39** and **Acts 2**. Old covenant believers enjoyed the Spirit’s presence and empowerment, yet not the climactic, eschatological indwelling that constitutes the church as a **temple** made of living stones. Theologically, this yields a robust account of continuity and discontinuity: one **covenant promise** that culminates in a transformed **ekklesia** after the resurrection. The **indwelling** thesis becomes a key plank in Hamilton’s larger **biblical theology**, informing his reading of **atonement**, **regeneration**, and **sanctification** as temple realities and framing the a fortiori argument that Christ’s priestly work secures not only forgiveness but **God-with-us** as the new-creation environment of believers.

#### 5. Apocalyptic coherence: Daniel and Revelation within the canon
Hamilton’s **With the Clouds of Heaven: The Theology of the Book of Daniel** (2014) and his **Revelation: The Spirit Speaks to the Churches** (2012) extend his canonical method into apocalyptic discourse. Reading **Daniel** as sixth-century prophecy and narrative, he foregrounds the **son of man** enthronement, the sovereignty of Israel’s God over the empires, and the pattern of faithful witness through persecution, all of which flow into the Gospels and **Revelation**. He mines the dense **intertextual** fabric of **Revelation** to argue that John narrates a **new exodus**, temple-building, and **new creation** in highly allusive ways, requiring readers trained in the Old Testament to hear the allusions. Hamilton aligns with a **historic premillennial** expectation of a future reign of Christ while emphasizing the present call to **perseverance** and **worship**. The apocalyptic corpus, for him, does not disrupt but rather intensifies the **glory in salvation through judgment** thesis, as the fall of **Babylon**, the vindication of the **martyrs**, and the descent of the **New Jerusalem** epitomize salvation through the final judgment of evil and the unveiling of divine **glory**.

#### 6. Pedagogy and condensation: What Is Biblical Theology?
In **What Is Biblical Theology?** (2014), Hamilton offers a concise hermeneutical primer for pastors and lay readers, translating his academic positions into catechetical prose. He defines **biblical theology** as reading the Bible according to its own **story**, **symbolism**, and **typology**, with **Jesus** as the fulfillment and **the church** as the people who inhabit the story’s drama. He maps recurring symbols, such as the **serpent**, **seed**, **tree**, **exile**, **exodus**, **tabernacle**, and **wisdom**, and he shows how these converge in **Christ**. This little book functions as a pedagogy for **expository preaching**, equipping congregations to follow **intertextual** cues and recognize **promise-shaped patterns**. The theological upshot is a people formed by the canon’s own imaginative lexicon, which recalibrates ethical reasoning, worship, and mission around **kingdom** realities. The book thus binds academic **biblical theology** to ecclesial practice, a defining mark of Hamilton’s vocation as a scholar-pastor.

#### 7. Typology defended and deployed: Promise-shaped patterns
Hamilton’s recent **Typology: Understanding the Bible’s Promise-Shaped Patterns** (2022) gives a mature account of the logic and limits of **typology**. He insists that types are historical, textual, and teleological, embedded by the **divine Author** from the outset and progressively clarified as the canon advances. Against **allegorizing**, he proposes controls: identifiable pattern repetition, escalation to **Christ**, and canonical confirmation. In dialogue with **Richard Hays’s** figural readings and **Brevard Childs’s** canonical shaping, he contends that typology must not sever from **authorial intent** but rather expand it under **divine authorship**. He details paradigmatic examples: the **Adam–Noah–Israel–David–Christ** succession, the **Joseph–Moses–Joshua–Jesus** mediator sequence, the **tabernacle–temple–Christ–church** presence line, and **exodus–return–cross–new exodus** liberation. His **Psalms** commentary in the **Evangelical Biblical Theology Commentary** series (2021) operationalizes the method, reading the Psalter messianically as the prayerbook of the **Davidic king** and the seed community in **Christ**. In all of this, the throughline remains **glory** revealed in the **judgment** of God’s enemies and the **salvation** of his people, accomplished and manifested finally in the **Messiah**.

#### 8. Law, covenant, and the church: Baptist new covenant distinctives
Hamilton’s **Baptist** commitments shape his deployment of **new covenant** theology. Emphasizing the inaugurated eschatological realities of **Jeremiah 31** and **Ezekiel 36**, he underscores the regenerate nature of the **new covenant** community, the universal **indwelling Spirit**, and the internalization of **Torah**. He thus stresses a decisive covenantal discontinuity at the point of covenant membership and **sacrament** practice, advocating **credobaptism** and a believers’ church. Regarding **law**, he argues that Christians are not under the **old covenant** law per se but under the **law of Christ**, which reconfigures **Sabbath**, **food laws**, and identity markers in the light of **Christ’s** fulfillment. Theologically, this aligns with his **temple presence** theme: the people indwelt by the **Spirit** are the **holy** temple that the Mosaic system anticipated. Ethically, Hamilton urges that **biblical theology** shapes discipleship, family life, and mission; the church’s ethics arise from the canonical story’s **kingdom** aims and **glory**-oriented telos rather than from abstract moral theory. The church is thus a living exegesis of **salvation through judgment**, embodying cruciform holiness and resurrection hope.

#### 9. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
Hamilton’s project positions him in ongoing debate with **Barr’s** anti-theological strictures, **Brueggemann’s** rhetorical pluralism, and **Childs’s** canonical theology, as well as with **Hays’s** figural hermeneutics and **Enns’s** critical challenges to **inerrancy** and **divine authorship**. He welcomes **Vosian** redemptive-historical trajectories and aligns with **Goldsworthy**, **Beale**, and **Carson** in methodological instincts. His proposal of a single **center** has generated discussion among evangelicals, some affirming the heuristic value of **glory in salvation through judgment**, others preferring **multiperspectival** constellations such as **kingdom**, **covenant**, and **presence**. In apocalyptic studies, his treatment of **Daniel** and **Revelation** represents a conservative, text-driven alternative to apocalyptic pessimism or pure idealism, and his likely **historic premillennial** reading has entered the intra-evangelical eschatology conversation. Ecclesially, Hamilton’s books such as **What Is Biblical Theology?** have been widely adopted in pastoral training, reinforcing a rising generation of expositors attuned to **intertextuality** and **typology**. The broader influence of his work lies in re-normalizing a confident, churchly **biblical theology** that is both academically engaged and liturgically fruitful.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: Strengths and tensions
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Hamilton’s strengths are substantial: a **Vosian** grasp of redemptive history, rigorous **canonical** exegesis, a disciplined use of **typology** under **divine authorship**, and a pastoral teleology that directs doctrine to **doxology**. His thesis that **glory** is manifested in **salvation through judgment** names a genuine biblical rhythm from **Genesis** to **Revelation**, and his **temple presence** and **new exodus** trajectories are deeply consonant with classic **covenant theology**. Yet tensions remain. First, the single-center proposal risks methodological **reductionism**, potentially subordinating other controlling categories like **covenant communion**, **union with Christ**, and **kingdom** to an explanatory monoculture. Second, his **Baptist** new covenant distinctives yield stronger discontinuity than the **Westminster Confession’s** one **covenant of grace** administered diversely; this affects **sacramental theology** and the visibility of the church’s **covenant** structure. Third, his **Spirit indwelling** thesis, while textually argued, may be pressed in ways that eclipse the robust presence of the Spirit among old covenant saints emphasized by **Reformed scholastics** and **Calvin**. Fourth, if he is indeed **historic premillennial**, this diverges from the **amillennial** or **modified idealist** instincts widely held in confessional Reformed circles, though his apocalyptic exegesis remains careful and theologically rich. A constructive Reformed alternative would retain Hamilton’s **intertextual typology** and canonical coherence while framing Scripture’s unity by the **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, centering soteriology in **union with Christ** as the formal bond of all redemption, and treating **glory in salvation through judgment** as a luminous strand within that broader covenantal tapestry. Even where differences remain, Hamilton’s work offers a formidable ally for a confessional **redemptive-historical** reading that aims at the church’s edification and the praise of the triune God.
