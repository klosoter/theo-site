### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Alan D. Strange emerges within late twentieth and early twenty-first century **American Presbyterianism**, serving as a minister in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** and as professor of **church history and theological studies** at **Mid-America Reformed Seminary**. His intellectual formation is marked by immersion in **Westminster confessionalism**, a pastoral commitment to the **ordinary means of grace**, and a historian's instinct for the continuity of **Reformed orthodoxy** from the **Reformation** through **Old Princeton** to contemporary **OPC** life. Strange's classroom and ecclesial labors unfold amid the unsettled post-evangelical landscape that followed the **1970s** fragmentation of North American Protestantism, the rise of **neo-Calvinist transformationalism**, the renewed appeal to **two-kingdoms** categories, and the intra-Reformed controversies surrounding **Federal Vision** and **justification**. His signature move is not to innovate but to clarify: to read the **Westminster Standards** as a coherent doctrinal system, to retrieve their **covenantal** and **ecclesiological** grammar, and to deploy them as a public theology for the church's pilgrim vocation under the **regulative principle of worship**.

Methodologically, Strange advances a **confessional-historical** approach. He treats the **Confession and Catechisms** as a settled doctrinal framework whose unity norms exegesis, ethics, and ecclesial practice. This is not a biblicist reduction but a catholic retrieval: the **Standards** summarize **Scripture** in classical **Reformed scholastic** idiom, pairing **divine simplicity** and **immutability** with **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, and assigning the **keys of the kingdom** to a church whose authority is spiritual and ministerial. Strange's method accents **ministerial not magisterial authority**, a principle that limits the church to declaring the **whole counsel of God** while refusing coercive civil entanglements. He appropriates **Cornelius Van Til's** antithesis and **Vosian** two-age eschatology but, following the **Westminster** use of **general equity** and **natural law** in WCF 19.4, he avoids collapsing public ethics into sectarian distinctives. The upshot is a rigorous **confessionalism** that is both historically informed and ecclesially oriented, priested through the sacraments and **preaching**, rather than platformed through political strategies.

Strange's formative interlocutors span **John Calvin**, **Francis Turretin**, and the **Westminster divines**, through **Old Princeton** figures like **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield**, to mid-twentieth-century **John Murray** and **OPC** architect **Ned Stonehouse**. His work frequently engages critics and revisionists such as **Norman Shepherd** on **justification and covenant**, **Federal Vision** proponents like **Douglas Wilson** and **Peter Leithart** on **baptismal efficacy** and **union with Christ**, and proponents of revised **two-kingdoms** theory including **David VanDrunen** and **D. G. Hart**. The resulting discourse is porous to church history, attentive to contemporary challenges, and governed by the **Westminster Standards** as a tested ecclesial canon.

#### 2. Major works and historiographical commitments
The pivotal monograph, **The Imputation of the Active Obedience of Christ in the Westminster Standards** (2019), displays Strange's characteristic precision. The thesis is historical and dogmatic: the **Westminster Confession** and **Catechisms** teach the **imputation of Christ's active obedience** as integral to justification, not merely the non-imputation of sin grounded in the cross but also the credited righteousness of Christ's law-keeping. Strange canvasses the drafting history of the **Assembly**, analyzes proof-texting and formulae in **WCF 11** and **LC 70-73**, and sets these alongside **Reformed scholastic** treatments by **Turretin**, **Rutherford**, and **Gillespie**. Against the claim that Westminster was deliberately ambiguous, he argues that the Standards' inclusion of phrases like "whole obedience" and "obedience and satisfaction of Christ" reflect a settled pattern of speech that refuses reduction of righteousness to the cross alone. The result is a robust account of **double imputation** grounded in **Christus Victor** only as a subset of **penal substitution** and **law-fulfilling obedience**. This is Strange at his most constructive: he reads the Standards contextually, aligns them with **federal theology**, and underwrites contemporary preaching of **justification by faith alone**.

Beyond imputation, Strange's essays in **Ordained Servant** and **The Confessional Presbyterian** return to **polity**, **worship**, and the **spirituality of the church**. He situates the **regulative principle of worship** as a pastoral doctrine that protects **conscience** and concentrates the service on **Word, sacrament, and prayer**. He locates Presbyterian **polity** in the flow from **Calvin's** consistory to **Knox's** assemblies to the **Westminster Form of Government**, emphasizing **ministerial authority**, graded courts, and mutual accountability. On **ecclesiastical power**, Strange rehearses the classic distinction between the **keys** and the **sword**, asserting the church's competence over doctrine, worship, and discipline, and denying the church corporate any commission to legislate public policy. This is his rendering of **the spirituality of the church**: not quietism, since believers as citizens pursue **general equity**, justice, and mercy; but ecclesial chastity, since the church as church speaks where Scripture speaks and refrains where it is silent.

A sustained strand of Strange's historical retrieval concerns **Charles Hodge** and **Old Princeton** on the **spirituality of the church**. Against caricature that **Hodge** bequeathed a political quietism, Strange argues that Hodge's doctrine flowed from **ministerial authority** and **confessional subscription**, thereby permitting principled witness on moral law and human dignity while refusing clerical capture by parties or platforms. Strange situates **Old Princeton** within the broader **Reformed orthodox** tradition, showing that **Warfield's** defense of **inerrancy** and **Murray's** refinement of **covenant theology** stand in continuity with **Westminster** rather than constituting a novelties. This historiography is not romantic; Strange acknowledges fissures and developments, including shifts in the doctrine of the **covenant of works** and debates over **republication**; but he reads these in terms of organic growth rather than rupture.

#### 3. Doctrinal loci and contested fronts
At the core of Strange's doctrinal contribution stand **justification**, **covenant**, **church**, and **worship**. On **justification**, Strange insists on the comprehensive reckoning of Christ's **obedience and satisfaction** to the believer through **imputation**, received by **faith alone**, and sealed sacramentally without any conflation of **instrumental faith** and **Spirit-wrought sanctification**. His sustained critique of **Federal Vision** locates the error not in a denial of union with Christ but in a reconfiguration of the ordo salutis that collapses **justification** into **covenantal faithfulness**, destabilizes assurance, and reassigns **baptism** a constitutive role better reserved for **Spirit-wrought faith**. The positive alternative is an ordo that orders **union with Christ** as the duplex beneficium, with **justification** and **sanctification** coordinated but not confused, and with **sacraments** as means of grace that confirm rather than constitute saving union.

On **covenant theology**, Strange is decidedly **bi-covenantal**. He defends a substantive **covenant of works** with Adam as federal head, not in Pelagian competition with grace but as an expression of **natural law** and **creational righteousness** that sets the stage for **Christ** as the second Adam. This framework stabilizes the **active obedience** thesis by making Christ's law-keeping integral to his mediatorial office. Strange remains cautious about the term **republication**, but he affirms that **Mosaic law** in its pedagogical use republished the **covenant of works** as to its legal demand, while the **Mosaic covenant** as an administration remains of the **covenant of grace**. In debates over **new perspective** and **Pauline law**, he aligns with traditional **Reformed** exegesis that locates Jewish boasting in works performed for righteousness and upholds the universality of sin under law.

On **ecclesiology** and **worship**, Strange applies the **regulative principle** to argue for simplicity and catholicity under **Westminster Directory** lines. For him, the church's identity is cruciform and pilgrim; her power is **spiritual**, exercised through **preaching**, **sacraments**, and **discipline**; her liturgy is a Word-shaped order suffused by **psalmody**, **prayer**, and **catechesis**. He emphasizes the importance of **confessional subscription** for office-bearers and the integrity of **graded courts** in Presbyterian church order. The church's mission is spiritual in end and means: the **Great Commission** deploys public means to make disciples across the nations, but it does not authorize the church corporate to become a policy broker. Christians, as citizens of the commonwealth, seek the **general equity** of biblical law, love neighbor, and labor for social good, but the church as church declares the **whole counsel of God** and disciplines its own.

In public theology, Strange engages **two-kingdoms** discourse and the **spirituality of the church** tradition. He appreciates the historical roots of two-kingdoms language in **Luther**, **Calvin**, and **the Westminster** reflection on magistracy in **WCF 23** and synods in **WCF 31**. He steers between extremes: affirming God's single rule while distinguishing **twofold government** of Christ over church and commonwealth; defending **natural law** as to civil righteousness while refusing to ground evangelism or ethics in neutrality. Against maximalist transformational programs that identify the church's success with cultural conquest, he champions a **pilgrim ecclesiology** that rejoices in public good but measures faithfulness by **Word and sacrament**. The result is an account of Christian citizenship that is principled, modest, and eschatologically realistic.

#### 4. Interlocutors, pedagogy, and integrative horizon
Strange's teaching ministry at **Mid-America Reformed Seminary** functions as the crucible of his writing. He cultivates a generation of ministers conversant with **Reformation** and **Post-Reformation** sources, alert to the pastoral import of **covenant theology**, and skilled in **Presbyterian polity** and **discipline**. His course work and essays model historical retrieval that feeds preaching: the **active obedience of Christ** becomes a homiletic theme that grounds assurance; the **regulative principle of worship** becomes pastoral counsel that shapes Lord's Day services; the **spirituality of the church** becomes sessional wisdom to avoid mission creep. Strange writes not as a detached academic but as a churchman in the **OPC**, serving committees, contributing to **Ordained Servant**, and participating in denominational reports that address **justification** and **sacramental theology** in the wake of **Federal Vision**. His prose carries the cadence of the pulpit as well as the archive.

In conversation with **Old Princeton**, Strange defends a chastened **scholasticism** that prizes precise terms like **imputation**, **instrumental causality**, and **federal headship**, while preaching the living Christ. He resists both the flattening of doctrinal families into slogans and the inflation of piety into an anti-doctrinal posture. His sympathy with **Van Til** does not lead to the evacuation of **natural law**; rather, he assigns **natural law** a civil function consonant with WCF 19.4's **general equity**, while insisting that **special revelation** alone founds saving knowledge and rules the church's public proclamation. This calibrated use of nature and grace opposes both triumphalist Christendom projects and secularist privatization of faith.

Strange's historical case studies are not mere antiquarianism. His treatment of **Charles Hodge** on the **spirituality of the church** offers a template for navigating modern pressure points. When asked whether the church should pronounce on economics, war, or public health, Strange returns to the **ministerial** character of church authority, the lawful remit of **synods and councils** under **WCF 31**, and the liberty of Christian conscience under **WCF 20**. He deploys **Old Princeton** not to shield the church from the world but to keep the church for the world, freeing it to address sin and salvation without partisan capture. Likewise, his defense of **active obedience** is not an arcane scholasticism but a pastoral chore: it tells battered consciences that God imputes to believers not only a cleared ledger but also the lived righteousness of the new **Adam**.

In controversies over **Federal Vision** and **Norman Shepherd**, Strange's writing keeps the confessional center. He acknowledges the biblical richness of **union with Christ** but refuses any construction that subordinates **imputation** to **participation**. He warns that making final salvation depend upon covenantal cooperation misreads **Romans 5** and **Galatians 2-3**, erodes assurance, and confuses **law** and **gospel**. At the same time, he affirms the absolute necessity of **sanctification**, the truth that the justified will be sanctified, and the ecclesial demand for **discipline** that calls the baptized to faith and repentance. His constructive posture aims to steady the pulpit and the session, giving ministers a map through vocabulary that often hides more than it reveals.

Strange's ecclesial instincts surface also in his account of **worship**. He argues that the **regulative principle** secures a Christ-centered liturgy tethered to **Scripture**, guarding against both liturgical minimalism and expressive maximalism. By rooting Lord's Day service in **reading and preaching**, **prayer**, **psalm and biblically warranted song**, and **sacraments**, he contends for a catholic Reformed practice that transcends subcultural taste and resists commodification. Here he follows **Knox**, the **Westminster Directory**, and modern **OPC** practice, commending a liturgy that catechizes hearts and stabilizes congregations under the Word.

The integrative horizon of Strange's thought is eschatological and pastoral. The church is an **embassy of the age to come**, gathered by the **ascended Christ**, fed by his **means of grace**, and sent into the world as salt and light. The temporal city remains under God's providence, sustained by **natural law** and **general equity**, and open to the leavening of Christian virtue. But the church's charter remains spiritual, ordered to the **gospel**, disciplined by the **keys**, and hopeful under the promise that the **gates of hell** will not prevail. In this vision, confessional retrieval is not nostalgia but confidence: the **Westminster Standards** articulate a wise, durable pattern for Christian faith and practice in a late-modern world hungry for clarity.

In sum, Strange's enduring contribution lies in his synthesis of **historical retrieval** and **pastoral application**. He binds the **active obedience of Christ** to the conscience, the **spirituality of the church** to polity, the **regulative principle** to worship, and **two-kingdoms** discriminations to citizenship. He is a clarifier more than a pioneer, a pastor-scholar who aligns contemporary Reformed witness with the deep grammar of its own confessional tradition.

Reformed/WTS evaluation. From the vantage of classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and the **Westminster Theological Seminary** tradition, Strange's project is substantially aligned: his defense of **double imputation**, **bi-covenantalism**, **ministerial authority**, and the **ordinary means of grace** coheres with **Van Tilian** antithesis and **Vosian** eschatology. Tensions appear at the junctures of **two-kingdoms** theory and **public theology**: some Kuyperian heirs will want stronger **sphere sovereignty** and a thicker account of Christian cultural labor than Strange's restrained **spirituality of the church** foregrounds. Likewise, his historical case for Westminster's explicit commitment to **active obedience** will be challenged by those who read the Assembly as purposefully open-textured. Within the bounds of the **Westminster Standards**, however, credible alternatives are principled, not oppositional: a more **Kuyperian principled pluralism** that supplements rather than supplants **spirituality of the church**; a nuanced use of **natural law** that is more fully integrated with the **antithesis**; and a hermeneutic of subscription that reads Westminster's soteriology in tandem with its **sacramentology** to guard both assurance and holiness. Strange's restraint on the church's civil role guards liberty of conscience and ecclesial purity, and the WTS tradition can welcome that instinct while continuing an intra-family debate over how **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, **history**, and **nature** coordinate in a coherent public witness.
