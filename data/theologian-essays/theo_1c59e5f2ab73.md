### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and intellectual posture
Gordon J. Wenham emerges from the late twentieth‑century British **evangelical** reconfiguration of Old Testament studies, a world anchored institutionally by **Tyndale House** and dialogically by proximity to mainstream **historical‑critical** scholarship. His vocational arc, including long teaching stints in British theological colleges and universities, placed him between **church catechesis** and **guild exegesis**, shaping a method that insists that rigorous **Hebrew philology** and **ancient Near Eastern** comparison serve ecclesial reading. Wenham’s formation bears the mark of the **Tyndale Fellowship** ethos of **scholarly confessionalism**, where a high doctrine of **Scripture’s authority** is not a substitute for but a summons to technical competence. In that setting he received and refined a pragmatically conservative stance toward **Pentateuchal criticism**: skeptical of confident reconstructions of **JEDP**, appreciative of **source** and **form** insights when tethered to the text’s final literary shape, and oriented to **canonical theology** akin to **Brevard Childs** though without Childs’s Church‑Dogmatics‑inflected apparatus.

Wenham’s method is emblematic of a broad evangelical **final‑form** turn: the canonical text is the proper object of Christian theology, yet its surface features invite comparison with **ANE law** and ritual, as well as attention to diachronic questions held with open hand. His exegesis is marked by structural sensitivity to **chiasm**, observation of repeated **motifs** such as the *toledot* formula in **Genesis**, and a pedagogical reading of **ritual**. Above all, he registers a conviction that biblical **narrative** is not merely descriptive but **normative** for the people of God. Hence the watchword of his later work: **story as Torah**.

#### 2. Leviticus and the pedagogy of holiness
Wenham’s first major monograph, **The Book of Leviticus** in NICOT 1979, remains a signature achievement. Against the caricature of Leviticus as an alien code of obsolete rules, Wenham articulates a coherent theology of **holiness** that integrates ritual and moral life. He unfolds the internal logic of **sacrifice** as both atoning and communing, analyzing **kippur** not as magical expiation but as priestly mediation that restores communion with **YHWH** and purges **sanctuary pollution**. Here he anticipates and then converses with the massive **Anchor Bible** series by **Jacob Milgrom**, agreeing on the seriousness of blood and impurity while maintaining a more classically evangelical account of **substitutionary atonement**.

Wenham’s expositions of **Leviticus 16** and the **Day of Atonement** show how sacrificial blood functions within a covenantal grammar of presence and purity. He refuses simplistic partitions of biblical law into rigid **ceremonial**, **civil**, and **moral** boxes, but he shows how that tripartite instinct grasps a real texture: ritual pedagogy and moral scope are intertwined such that purity legislation, dietary restriction, and sexual boundaries in **Leviticus 11–20** cultivate Israel’s vocation to be a **holy nation**. Influenced by **Mary Douglas** on purity symbolism, he interprets food laws and bodily boundaries as emblematic of **creation order** and communal identity. In this key work Wenham begins to advance the now widely accepted thesis that **creation and sanctuary** mirror one another, so that priestly holiness reflects **Edenic** communion, a suggestion later amplified by **G. K. Beale** and **L. Michael Morales**.

#### 3. Genesis, composition, and theological history
Wenham’s **Word Biblical Commentary** on **Genesis 1–15** 1987 and **Genesis 16–50** 1994 combined technical grammar, informed **Pentateuchal criticism**, and robust theological exposition. He rejects partisan overconfidence in both minimalist and maximalist histories of composition. The **toledot** rubric organizes the book’s macro‑structure; **primeval history** and **patriarchal narratives** are read as mutually interpreting units within a **covenant** frame. On **Genesis 1–3**, Wenham explores the dense intertextuality by which **creation** is depicted as proto‑sanctuary, **Adam** as priest‑king, and **Sabbath** as a sign of cosmic order and divine rest. On **marriage**, he offers a clear exposition of **one‑flesh** union and its moral implications, often cited in evangelical treatments of **sexual ethics**, precisely because it grounds normativity in **creation theology** rather than mere cultural mores.

In the **flood** account, Wenham famously details the **chiastic** structure and compositional artistry of **Genesis 6–9**. He neither collapses the narrative into myth nor treats it as modern reportage; it is, in his often‑repeated framing, a piece of ancient **theological historiography**. The **Noahic covenant** he reads as universal and non‑redemptive, a divine charter for the preservation of life and the stability of nature, which in turn undergirds human justice and restraint of violence. This reading is developed in later reflections in **Rethinking Genesis 1–11** 2015, where Wenham argues that the primeval narratives function as **gateway texts** for the canon, setting trajectories of **sin**, **judgment**, **common grace**, and **promise** that are intensified in **Abrahamic** election.

#### 4. Numbers, wilderness pedagogy, and the shape of moral formation
The **Tyndale Old Testament Commentary** on **Numbers** 1981 continues Wenham’s integration of narrative and law, attending to the **wilderness** as a crucible of **covenant fidelity** and communal testing. He highlights the camp’s spatial geometry as a microcosm of **holiness** ordered toward the **tabernacle**, while reading episodes of rebellion and plague as case studies in **discipline**, **intercession**, and **leadership**. Here as elsewhere he takes seriously the exemplary function of biblical narrative: Israel’s **murmuring**, **Korah’s rebellion**, and **Balaam’s oracles** yield moral insight soaked in theology. The emphasis falls not on proof‑texting legal precepts but on learning God’s ways from **story**, a method that anticipates his later programmatic statement in **Story as Torah** 2000.

In that pivotal book, Wenham contends that biblical **narrative** functions as **Torah**, that is, as instruction that forms virtues, shapes communal memory, and underwrites practical judgment. He offers worked examples from **Genesis**, showing how narratives like **Genesis 22** or **Genesis 38** inculcate reverence, fidelity, and chastity precisely through their narratival density, ambiguity, and rhetorical pacing. He neither evacuates narrative of normativity nor flattens it into a code. Instead, he invites readers to a hermeneutic of **exemplarity** governed by canonical co‑texts and the character of **YHWH**. The result is an **ethic of reading** wherein *lex orandi, lex credendi, lex vivendi* cohere.

#### 5. Canonical shape, Psalter piety, and ethical prayer
Wenham extends the same thesis to the Psalms in **Psalms as Torah** 2012. There he probes the **canonical shape** of the **Psalter**, its five‑book structure, and the prominence of **Torah psalms** like **Psalm 1** and **Psalm 119**, arguing that the Psalms teach the faithful how to live before God through **prayer** that is morally formative. For Wenham, sung confession of **YHWH’s kingship**, lament over **injustice**, and praise for **covenant mercy** construct a world in which the people are habituated to **righteousness**. His approach resonates with **Robert Alter’s** literary sensitivity but is decisively more theological and ecclesial, situating **poetry** within the **canon’s** didactic aim.

This focus on **prayer** and ethics does not marginalize doctrine but discloses its practical telos. The Psalter’s **royal** and **messianic** themes locate hope in the **Davidic** promise, knitting together the **creation‑covenant‑kingdom** arc that Wenham already tracks in **Genesis** and **Leviticus**. The triad of **law**, **story**, and **song** becomes for Wenham a canonical symphony of instruction.

#### 6. Engagements with critical scholarship and the final‑form turn
From his earliest publications Wenham engages respectfully yet critically with the **Documentary Hypothesis**, the **traditio‑historical** synthesis of **von Rad**, and the **Deuteronomistic** theories of **Noth**. He acknowledges that **source** and **redactional** processes likely stand behind the present text but insists that confidence in elaborate reconstructions exceeds the evidence and distracts from the text’s designed **literary unity**. In **Genesis** he gives sustained attention to the *toledot* seams, narrative glue, and thematic recursions that commend a **coherent composition**. In **Leviticus**, he demonstrates how the **Holiness Code** complements priestly instruction, making Israel’s ethic an outflow of **YHWH’s character**.

Wenham’s dialogue partners include **Brevard Childs**, whose **canonical approach** parallels Wenham’s final‑form priority while diverging in method and purpose, and **Mary Douglas**, whose symbolic anthropology of **purity** Wenham appropriates and refines. He reads **Jacob Milgrom’s** monumental exegesis with gratitude for its ethical emphases yet pushes back where Milgrom downplays **substitution**. He profits from **Robert Alter’s** literary readings and **Adele Berlin’s** poetics but refuses a purely aesthetic hermeneutic. Across his corpus he sets an example of evangelical participation in mainstream debates without capitulation to methodological naturalism. The result is a hermeneutic that honors **Scripture’s authority** while practicing disciplined **critical realism**.

#### 7. Doctrinal contributions through exegetical theology
Wenham’s doctrinal influence flows through exegesis rather than stand‑alone dogmatics, yet several nodes deserve explicit mention. On **atonement**, his account in **Leviticus** keeps together **purification from pollution** and **substitutionary sacrifice**, providing a textured background for New Testament claims about **Christ’s priesthood** and **cross**. On **holiness**, he advances an **imitation Dei** paradigm: Israel’s ritual distinctiveness and moral rectitude mirror the **holy God**, not as arbitrary taboo but as participation in **creation order**. On **creation**, his reading of **Genesis 1–3** has seeded the common evangelical conviction that the garden is a **proto‑temple**, that **humanity** is royal‑priestly, and that **Sabbath** signifies consummation. On **covenant**, his insistence on the universal scope of the **Noahic covenant** clarifies the theological grounding for political and social stability under common grace, distinct from the redemptive **Abrahamic and Mosaic covenants**.

Ethically, Wenham’s **narrative normativity** is a corrective to code‑only approaches. **Story as Torah** and **Psalms as Torah** together commend practices of reading and praying that shape virtues and communal habits. In debates on **sexual ethics**, Wenham’s work on **Leviticus 18–20** and **Genesis 1–2** offers a clear, creation‑anchored grammar for chastity, marriage, and boundary‑keeping that has informed evangelical and ecumenical moral teaching. In hermeneutics, his **final‑form** priority serves as a stabilizing principle amid proliferating diachronic theories.

#### 8. Pedagogy, synthesis, and accessible evangelical scholarship
Wenham is also a synthesizer and teacher. **Exploring the Old Testament: The Pentateuch** 2003 distills complex debates for pastors and students, introducing **source criticism**, **form criticism**, and **canonical** reading while modeling evangelical confidence and humility. The book is characteristic: no polemics, but firm persuasion that the theological riches of the **Pentateuch** are best accessed through persistent attention to the text as it stands, with **ANE parallels** illuminating rather than domesticating Israel’s uniqueness. His shorter essays and conference papers on topics like the **sanctuary‑creation** nexus and the coherence of the **flood** narrative have circulated widely, shaping how evangelical seminarians approach **Genesis** and **Leviticus**.

The cumulative effect of Wenham’s pedagogical work is to normalize among evangelicals a posture that is neither defensive nor credulous toward critical scholarship. His voice has helped an entire generation handle **ritual law**, **genealogies**, and so‑called difficult texts with theological expectancy rather than embarrassment. Where others have chosen either **harmonization** at all costs or **demythologizing** depletion, Wenham exemplifies **patient exegesis** in service to the church.

#### 9. Influence, debates, and reception
Wenham’s influence extends both across evangelicalism and into wider academic discourse. His **NICOT Leviticus** holds its own in conversation with **Milgrom** and has been complemented by later evangelical commentaries such as **Daniel Block’s** and **Jay Sklar’s** work on **Leviticus**, which continue the emphases on **holiness**, **atonement**, and **ritual pedagogy**. His **Genesis WBC** volumes sit alongside **Derek Kidner** and **John Goldingay** as staples in conservative libraries, while his rhetorical analyses resonate with **Robert Alter** and **Meir Sternberg** in literary circles. Wenham’s **creation‑temple** thesis has fertilized subsequent biblical theology by **G. K. Beale** and **L. Michael Morales**, generating a robust account of **tabernacle‑temple** as the spatial form of **communion with God**.

Debates have not been absent. Some critical scholars have faulted Wenham’s restraint regarding **JEDP** and his guarded approach to **historicity** claims as insufficiently engaged with archaeology or compositional models; others within evangelicalism have wished for stronger apologetic assertion of **mosaic authorship**. On the ethical front, his appropriation of **Mary Douglas** has sparked discussion about how far **symbolic** readings should be pressed. Yet the durable reception of his works suggests that his balance of caution and clarity has met a real need in the field. Within academic evangelicalism his voice models what might be called **canonical critical realism**: the canon is a providentially given unity, its claims about God and the world are true, and our reading of it must be attentive to genre, history, and literary art.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Wenham’s corpus is a substantial ally with a few signal caveats. Positively, his high view of **Scripture’s authority**, his covenantal instincts regarding **creation**, **Noahic common grace**, and **Abrahamic promise**, and his insistence that **narrative** and **ritual** are theologically meaningful align closely with **Westminster** commitments to the whole counsel of God and the **general equity** of the judicial laws. His **atonement** exegesis in **Leviticus** richly supports a **penal‑substitutionary** reading of **Christ’s cross**, and his **creation‑sanctuary** insights buttress the **Vosian** and **Ridderbosian** redemptive‑historical vision wherein temple and kingdom consummate in **Christ**. His treatment of the **Noahic covenant** provides useful scaffolding for Reformed accounts of the **two kingdoms** or common kingdom, clarifying the providential order distinct from the **covenant of grace**. The cautions are methodic and theological. Methodically, Wenham’s final‑form focus sometimes brackets the deeper, typological **Christocentric** telos that a **WTS** hermeneutic insists must explicitly govern Old Testament exposition, which can leave his ethical conclusions vulnerable to **moralism** if not integrated with **law‑gospel** ordering. Theologically, his program of **story as Torah** would be strengthened by a thicker account of how **Mosaic law** in its civil and ceremonial aspects abides only by **general equity** in the new covenant and how **Christ’s obedience** consummates and transforms law’s normativity. Finally, his careful use of **ANE parallels** is exemplary, yet Reformed readers will caution that comparative frames must never relativize Israel’s **covenantal uniqueness** grounded in **special revelation**. These are matters of accent rather than substance. Within classical Reformed orthodoxy, Wenham’s work can be warmly received as a treasury of exegetical judgment that, when set within an explicit **Christological** and **covenantal** structure, powerfully serves the church’s doctrine, worship, and life.
