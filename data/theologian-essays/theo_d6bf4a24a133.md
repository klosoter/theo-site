### ESSAY
Grant Macaskill enters the field as a Scottish New Testament scholar whose enduring contribution is the retrieval and clarification of **union with Christ** as the canonical nerve center of **New Testament soteriology** and **Christian identity**. Trained within the distinctive ecosystem of **Aberdeen biblical studies**, with its historic ties to **Reformed theology** and the legacy of careful, ecclesially sensitive **exegesis**, he advances a conversation catalyzed by twentieth-century debates over the **New Perspective on Paul** and the more recent **apocalyptic Paul** turn. Rather than choosing either a purely **forensic** or a purely **participatory** paradigm, Macaskill articulates an integrative account, insisting that the grammar of salvation in Scripture binds **justification**, **sanctification**, and **adoption** into a single **pneumatological incorporation into Christ**. His work is explicitly theological, though his method proceeds from **philology**, **discourse analysis**, and sustained attention to **Greek prepositions** and **syn-compounds** that carry the syntax of **participation** and **identification** across the apostolic writings.

#### 1.
The intellectual setting of Macaskill’s project is marked by the post-1970s reassessment of **Pauline soteriology**, the retrieval of **patristic theosis**, and a renewed interest in **Reformed unio cum Christo**. Dialogue partners span the interpreters of **Second Temple Judaism** and the questions raised by **N. T. Wright** and **John Barclay** regarding **grace** and **covenant**, alongside the apocalyptic emphases of **J. Louis Martyn** and **Beverly Gaventa**. Macaskill’s distinctiveness lies in his resistance to dichotomies. He rejects any opposition between **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** that would detach the believer’s status from the **Christ event**, and he challenges the polarity between **forensic justification** and **mystical union** that often misreads both **Paul** and **John**. He draws upon **Calvin’s unio cum Christo** as conceptual ballast, yet he expands the discussion beyond **Pauline terminology** to include **Johannine abiding**, the **synoptic** material, and selective readings of **Catholic Epistles** and **Hebrews**, aiming for canonical coherence.

#### 2.
Methodologically, Macaskill foregrounds the exegetical payoffs of tracking **en Christo**, **dia Christou**, and **syn-** compounds, showing how the New Testament frames salvation as **Spirit-mediated incorporation** into the crucified and risen **Messiah**. His reading strategy is canonical and **pneumatological**: believers participate in Christ because the **Spirit** who raised Jesus from the dead unites them to him, conferring both a **new status** before God and a **new mode of life**. He retrieves **theosis** from the **Greek fathers** as a heuristic category but rigorously qualifies it by the **Creator-creature distinction**, the **extra Calvinisticum** logic of Christ’s person, and the **Reformed** insistence that God remains **simple** and impassible *ad intra*. He frames participation not as an ontological fusion but as covenantal, **Christological, and ecclesial identification**, never collapsing **imputation** into **infusion** nor severing **sanctification** from **union**. This approached is tempered by an explicit theological virtue of **intellectual humility**, which he excavates from **Pauline boasting** and **Philippians 2**.

The early monograph, **Union with Christ in the New Testament** 2013, sets the agenda. Macaskill’s thesis is that the New Testament across corpora depicts salvation as **incorporation into Christ**, such that every major soteriological benefit is mediated **in him** and through **the Spirit**. He presses beyond word-counting and argues that **en Christo** signals more than a metaphorical approximation; it indicates a new **eschatological location** for the believer, the transfer from the realms of **sin**, **flesh**, and **death** into the realm of **Christ** and **Spirit**. Interacting with **Constantine R. Campbell** on union language, **Michael Gorman** on **cruciform participation**, and **J. Louis Martyn** on apocalyptic invasion, Macaskill insists that participation is simultaneously **forensic** and **transformative**. **Justification** is not an external add-on but the verdict that belongs within the **participatory state**, while **sanctification** is the ethical shape of life that arises from the same **Spirit-given union**.

A complementary development appears in **Living in Union with Christ: Paul’s Gospel and Christian Identity** 2019. Here Macaskill brings the exegetical thesis into contact with questions of **identity**, drawing on **social identity theory** and the church’s pastoral needs. He contends that the believer’s most fundamental descriptor is being **in Christ**, and that this Christic identity relativizes but does not erase **ethnic**, **gendered**, and **social** markers. By situating **baptism** and the **Lord’s Supper** within this identity-forming matrix, he articulates a robust **ecclesiology**: the church is the **body of Christ**, the community whose corporate life is participation in the Son’s **obedience**, **suffering**, and **resurrection power**. Against **expressive individualism**, he argues that Christian self-understanding is fundamentally **receptive**, **covenantal**, and **pneumatological**, a reception of the Son’s history as the believer’s new place of existence. This provides a rubric for the virtues of **humility**, **faith**, and **love**, not as isolated moral achievements but as the life-patterns of those who live **from union**.

Macaskill’s approach to **theosis** is both appreciative and circumspect. He retrieves **Athanasius’** and **Cyril’s** grammar of **participation** to articulate how believers share in **divine life** through the incarnate and exalted Christ, yet he explicitly fences against any erosion of **divine aseity** or the **Creator-creature distinction**. His exegesis of **2 Peter 1:4**, concerning becoming **koinonoi theias physeos**, is emblematic. He reads the promise neither as ontological absorption nor as a merely figurative trope, but as **eschatological sharing** in **immortality**, **glory**, and **virtue** through **Spirit-wrought conformity to Christ**. Interacting with **Vladimir Lossky** and **John Zizioulas**, he proposes a **Reformed deification** wherein **adoption**, **sanctification**, and **glorification** are modes of **participation** that leave **divine simplicity** and **immutability** intact. This retrieval realigns **Calvin’s unio** with patristic resources, while steering clear of metaphysical conflations or **created grace** models alien to **Reformed confessions**.

An important horizon of his work opens onto disability and ecclesial practice in **Autism and the Church: Bible, Theology, and Community** 2019. Here Macaskill brings the same **union-centric ecclesiology** into conversation with **neurodiversity**, drawing on the pastoral and theological insights of **John Swinton**. He exegetes **1 Corinthians 12** and **Luke 14** to argue that the body of Christ is constituted by **mutual belonging** and the Spirit’s distribution of diverse gifts, rather than by conformity to neurotypical norms. The **imago Dei** is reframed Christologically, such that participation in the **cruciform Son** redefines strength and weakness, speech and silence, attention and memory. The book is not a departure from his earlier work but an applied expansion: if life **in Christ** is the church’s true identity, then ecclesial practices must be configured around **hospitality**, **patient formation**, and **sacramental inclusion** that anticipate **eschatological wholeness**.

Closely linked is Macaskill’s sustained work on **intellectual humility**, emerging in essays and collaborative projects circa 2018–2021. He contends that **boasting in the Lord** and the **kenosis** of **Philippians 2** frame a biblical anthropology of knowledge that resists **self-authorization** and **rhetorical domination**. This epistemic posture is not quietism but a **cruciform epistemology** grounded in **union with the humbled and exalted Christ**. In pastoral register, **intellectual humility** facilitates communities that cherish **listening**, **confession**, and **mutual correction**, virtues that correlate with life in the **Spirit** and the **body of Christ**. The result is a coherent ethic that unites doctrines of **union**, **ecclesiology**, and **virtue formation** in the church’s common life.

Beyond the monographs, Macaskill has written essays that refine his central claims in dialogue with the **Reformed tradition** and contemporary debates. He has pressed the continuity between **Calvin’s duplex gratia** and the apostolic pattern, argued for a robust integration of **imputation** with **participation** in treatments of **Galatians** and **Romans**, and engaged **Michael Gorman** and **Douglas Campbell** on **apocalyptic** and **cruciformity**. He has also probed **Johannine** themes of **abiding** and **mutual indwelling** to show that **union** is not a solely Pauline trope but a canonical reality shaped by **Trinitarian missions**. Occasional essays on **Ephesians** and **Colossians** trace how **cosmic Christology** underwrites believer incorporation, while forays into **Hebrews** illuminate how **priestly mediation** and **heavenly session** organize the logic of **access**, **cleansing**, and **perseverance**. Throughout, his tone is retrievalist, not revolutionary, seeking to bind exegetical precision to **dogmatic clarity**.

Doctrinally, Macaskill’s synthesis can be stated with precision. First, **union with Christ** is the ontological-relational condition in which all soteriological benefits are given by the **Spirit** through faith. Second, **justification** is a **forensic** verdict inseparable from union, grounded **extra nos** in the obedience and death of **Christ**, and mediated **in nobis** by the **Spirit** who binds the believer to this **covenantal head**. Third, **sanctification** is the form of life that necessarily flows from union, a Spirit-enabled **conformitas Christi** manifest in cruciform **love**, and ordered to **glorification**. Fourth, **adoption** is not a sentimental metaphor but the filial share in the Son’s **Abba** relation, realized in the church’s **cry of the Spirit** and sacramentally nourished in **baptism** and the **Eucharist**. Fifth, **theosis** names the eschatological participation of the saints in **divine life** without confusion of natures, a participation bounded by **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, and the **Creator-creature** gulf. Finally, this soteriology is **ecclesial**: believers are incorporated into the **body of Christ**, where diverse members are honored, the **weak** are indispensable, and the church’s moral vision is an outflow of its **union**.

Macaskill’s ecclesial applications underscore how his thesis reconfigures practices of **formation**, **hospitality**, and **witness**. A church gathered around **union with Christ** will resist identity constructions sourced in nation, class, or psychology, centering instead on the sacramental and **pneumatological** markers that define belonging. It will calibrate catechesis to teach believers to narrate their lives as lives lived **in Christ**, and it will assess ministries and leadership against the criterion of **intellectual humility** and **kenotic service**. His work on **autism** pushes this trajectory still further by challenging the church to discover the gifts embedded in cognitive and sensory difference, to adjust liturgical environments for accessibility, and to receive those who might otherwise be silenced as **teachers in the body**. Such implications confirm that the thesis of **union** is not a theoretical novelty but a re-centering of the church’s life on **Christ** and the **Spirit**.

For Reformed theology, Macaskill’s proposal bears immediate promise. The emphases on **federal headship**, **Spirit-union**, and the integration of **justification** and **sanctification** within **unio** resonate with **Calvin**, the **Westminster Standards**, and the best of **post-Reformation orthodoxy**. His refusal to sever **forensic** from **participatory** idioms guards against both bare legalism and antinomian quietism. The careful retrieval of **theosis** as a Reformed category offers a constructive bridge to **patristic** and **Eastern** insights while safeguarding **divine immutability** and **simplicity**. The pastoral turn to **neurodiversity** exhibits a theology that is at once **catholic**, **reformed**, and **missionally attentive**.

A concise Reformed or Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation may be framed as follows. Positively, Macaskill’s centering of **union with Christ** coheres with **covenant of grace** commitments and clarifies how the **ordo salutis** nests within **historia salutis**. His exegetical rigor prevents the twin errors of collapsing **imputation** into **infusion** or creating a bare **forensic** abstraction. Cautions include the need to state with greater explicitness the **immediate imputation of Christ’s righteousness** as the ground of **justification** within union, lest participatory language obscure the **legal verdict**. A second caution touches his qualified **theosis**: while well fenced, it should be consistently indexed to **adoption** and to **eschatological communion**, avoiding vocabulary that suggests an ontological upgrade rather than **communion by grace**. Finally, his reception of **neurodiversity** ought to be dialectically held with **noetic effects of sin**, remembering that union’s transformative power includes the moral renewal of the intellect while honoring created differences. With these calibrations, Macaskill’s work stands as a substantive ally for a **classical Reformed** account of salvation, ecclesial identity, and pastoral practice anchored in **Christ and the Spirit**.
