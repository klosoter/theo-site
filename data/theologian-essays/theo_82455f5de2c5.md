### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John D. Woodbridge emerged as a leading evangelical historian within the crucible of **postwar evangelicalism** where questions of **biblical authority** and **inerrancy** defined public identity. Teaching for decades at **Trinity Evangelical Divinity School** and serving the wider network around **Christianity Today**, he inhabited the same orbit as **Carl F. H. Henry** and **Harold Lindsell**, figures who catalyzed the **International Council on Biblical Inerrancy** and the **Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy** in 1978. The volatile intellectual field included the ascendant prestige of **historical criticism**, the critique of propositional revelation in **neo-orthodoxy**, and the historiographical challenge issued by **Jack Rogers and Donald McKim** that **inerrancy** was a late, largely **Old Princeton** innovation. Trained as a historian of Christian thought and conversant with **patristic**, **medieval**, and **Reformation** sources, Woodbridge pressed a method of careful primary-source retrieval with an explicit anti-anachronist aim: let **Augustine**, **Calvin**, and **Turretin** speak in their own terms about **Scripture’s truthfulness**. His methodological posture combined **grammatico-historical exegesis**, classic **sensus literalis**, and sober historical criticism of documents, yielding an evangelical **critical realism** that refused both historicist reduction and fideistic insulation.

The touchstone of Woodbridge’s method is precise definition of terms, especially **inerrancy** and **infallibility**, alongside a pastoral concern for **authorial intention** and **genre**. Rather than equate **inerrancy** with wooden literalism, he frames it as a doctrine of **veracity** of the autographic text under the **verbal plenary inspiration** of the Holy Spirit, articulated with due regard to **phenomenal description** and **accommodation**. Through this lens, he examines the history of doctrine not as detached antiquarianism but as a confessional service to the church’s **sola Scriptura** commitment. The resulting approach treats historical theology as a discipline that can correct modern misreadings even as it locates enduring doctrinal consensus across the catholic and Reformation traditions on **Scripture’s truthfulness**.

#### 2. The Rogers–McKim thesis and Woodbridge’s counter-history
The pivotal controversy that defined Woodbridge’s public work was the Rogers–McKim thesis set forth in **The Authority and Interpretation of the Bible** in 1979. Rogers and McKim argued that premodern Christians affirmed **infallibility** limited to matters of faith and practice, that **inerrancy** emerged late with **Charles Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield** under the influence of **Scottish Common Sense Realism**, and that contemporary evangelicalism had elevated a novel view of **biblical authority**. In **Biblical Authority: A Critique of the Rogers/McKim Proposal** in 1982, Woodbridge mounted a detailed historical rebuttal. He meticulously assembled testimonies from **Augustine** in works like **De Genesi ad litteram** and **Epistula 82**, where the bishop insists on the **complete truthfulness** of Scripture and refuses the option of inspired error. He highlighted **Aquinas’s** account of **divine veracity** in relation to Scripture, and he drew from **Luther’s** and **Calvin’s** insistence on **Scripture’s inerrant authority**, including Calvin’s affirmation in the **Institutes** that Scripture bears **indubitable** authority grounded in the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**.

At the Reformation and Post-Reformation juncture, Woodbridge appealed to **Francis Turretin**, whose **Institutio theologiae elencticae** articulates a comprehensive doctrine of inspiration and **Scripture’s immunity from error** in the autographa as the **principium cognoscendi** of theology. Woodbridge then turned to **Old Princeton**, carefully reading **A. A. Hodge** and **B. B. Warfield** to show that their **inerrancy** was not rationalist novelty but a terminological crystallization of a catholic and Reformed inheritance. He showed that appeals to **Scottish Common Sense Realism** as a corrupting influence were overstated and that the Princeton men carefully constrained reason under **revelation**, employing **grammatico-historical exegesis** already valued by the Reformers. The critique exposed methodological flaws in Rogers and McKim’s use of sources, including selective quotation, category confusion between **infallibility** and **inerrancy**, and insufficient attention to **genre** and **accommodation** in premodern texts.

#### 3. Authority, canon, and hermeneutics in dialogue with contemporary theory
Woodbridge extended his argument into broader questions of **authority** and **interpretation** through edited volumes that gathered interdisciplinary voices. In **Scripture and Truth** in 1983 with **D. A. Carson**, he curated essays that reasserted **Scripture’s propositional truth** while integrating advances in **linguistics** and **hermeneutics**. The volume explored how **authorial intention** functions within a confessional doctrine of **inspiration**, how **speech-acts** clarify the nature of biblical assertions, and how **canonical context** stabilizes meaning without collapsing into relativism. In **Hermeneutics, Authority, and Canon** in 1986, Woodbridge and Carson drew sustained attention to the interplay of **canon formation**, **church tradition**, and **biblical authority** against the grain of **postliberal** and **neo-orthodox** tendencies to identify the Word of God principally with ecclesial performance or existential encounter.

Across these projects, Woodbridge pursued a consistent line: **canon** is ministerial and receptive, not constitutive, such that the church recognizes but does not create **Scripture’s authority**. This is a Reformed application of **sola Scriptura** where **tradition** is norma normata under the norma normans of the Bible. He pressed this point against **canon-within-the-canon** strategies and **community-linguistic** reductions, arguing that historic Christianity has confessed a materially unified and truthful **Scripture** whose claims upon the church stand irrespective of critical fashion. The message, framed with consonant **Augustinian** and **Calvinian** accents, served as an evangelical via media between naïve foundationalism and hermeneutical despair.

#### 4. Evangelical identity, intellectual culture, and the public square
Beyond the specialized debates about **inerrancy**, Woodbridge contributed to the shaping of evangelical intellectual culture. As co-editor of **God and Culture: Essays in Honor of Carl F. H. Henry** in 1993, he helped articulate a vision of **revelation and culture** that takes **propositional truth** seriously while engaging the arts, politics, and the academy. The volume honored **Henry’s** insistence on public theology grounded in **biblical authority** and challenged evangelical anti-intellectualism. In the epistolary primer **Letters Along the Way** in 1993 with **D. A. Carson**, Woodbridge used narrative counseling to form younger scholars in spiritual and academic virtues, treating issues of **calling**, **churchmanship**, and **intellectual integrity** as inseparable from **doctrinal fidelity** to **Scripture**.

As editor of compendia like **Great Leaders of the Christian Church** in 1988, Woodbridge modeled historical retrieval as a spiritual discipline, drawing students into the voices of **Athanasius**, **Augustine**, **Anselm**, **Luther**, **Calvin**, and **Edwards** as living conversation partners. The implicit thesis across these projects was that **evangelicalism** flourishes where **Scripture’s authority** grounds an ambitious, catholic-minded scholarship that tests itself against the best of the Christian tradition. In this way he functioned as a bridge between **church history** and **systematic theology**, refusing the siloing that often isolates doctrinal debate from historical consciousness.

#### 5. Doctrinal contours: inerrancy, genre, and the autographa
In doctrinal terms, Woodbridge’s contribution is a carefully qualified defense of **inerrancy** that resists caricature. He emphasizes that **verbal plenary inspiration** does not negate **authorial style**, **genre conventions**, or **phenomenal language** but guarantees that what the biblical writers affirm, God affirms, and therefore is true. This aligns with **Augustine’s** counsel: if a biblical text appears to err, we must suspect either the manuscript, the translation, or our interpretation. For Woodbridge, the doctrine refers to the **autographa**, which is not a dodge but the only coherent way to connect **inspiration** with the text as originally given. He integrates **textual criticism** as a ministerial task that, because of the extraordinary preservation of the text, yields a stable access to the autographic content, thereby rendering the doctrine pastorally meaningful.

He further clarifies that **inerrancy** concerns the truthfulness of assertions according to **authorial intention**, which requires sensitivity to **literary genre** in the canon: poetry, hyperbole, parable, historiography, and apocalyptic have diverse truth conditions. This approach distances his position from both **literalist** distortion and the **limited inerrancy** view that draws artificial lines between theological and historical or scientific material. In Woodbridge’s account, redemptive-historical claims are intrinsically tethered to the reality of events. That is, the **resurrection** is not merely theologically significant but historically true, and Scripture speaks truthfully when it narrates the works of God in time. This frames **inerrancy** as a doctrine of **divine veracity** rather than a modernist obsession with precision.

#### 6. History, theology, and the catholic Reformed consensus
Woodbridge’s historical work aims at describing a broad catholic consensus on **Scripture’s truthfulness** that runs from the **fathers** through the **medievals**, through **Luther** and **Calvin**, and into **Post-Reformation orthodoxy** and **Old Princeton**. He understands this consensus to be encapsulated by **sola Scriptura**, the **magisterium of Scripture**, and the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum** that grounds the believer’s certainty. He frequently invokes **Turretin’s** distinctions to show that **Scripture as principium cognoscendi** yields theological knowledge that is certain because God speaks. At the same time, he situates **Old Princeton** as a faithful heir rather than a rationalist deviant, reading **Warfield** as developing a more explicit terminology for what earlier Christians meant by **veracity** and **inspiration**.

The polemical edge of this retrieval is directed not only at Rogers and McKim but also at the claim that **Barthian** and **postliberal** alternatives better represent premodern instincts. Woodbridge’s reading emphasizes that even when **Augustine** or **Calvin** speak in pastoral or sacramental modes, they do so with an unwavering confidence that the biblical text speaks **true** in what it affirms, and that the church’s **rule of faith** is normed by the prophetic and apostolic writings. He thus refuses a hermeneutic that diffuses authority into ecclesial performance, underscoring instead a stable **canon** with definitive cognitive content.

#### 7. Interdisciplinary engagements and pastoral implications
Woodbridge’s editorial partnerships invited conversation with analytic philosophy, linguistics, and hermeneutics in order to clarify **biblical authority** for contemporary debates. Attention to **speech-act theory** and **authorial intention** functions in his projects to show how **truth claims** and **illocutions** can be properly parsed, undermining the false dichotomy between propositionalism and literary sensitivity. Although not a systematizer in the narrow sense, he labored to ensure that evangelical theologians and pastors understood what is at stake: the church’s preaching of **the gospel** rests on a trustworthy **Scripture** whose **inerrant** witness grounds **faith and obedience**. The pastoral thrust is evident in his insistence that doctrinal debates be lodged within the life of the church, a conviction visible in **Letters Along the Way** where the formation of a scholar is inseparable from submission to **Scripture** and commitment to **the local church**.

For Woodbridge, **biblical authority** is not a slogan but a practice: it requires patient exegesis, historical memory, and moral seriousness. He sees the cultivation of evangelical scholarship as an act of stewardship under the Lordship of Christ, one that resists both academic fashion and partisan sloganeering. By modeling careful citation and fair engagement with opponents, he seeks to embody the very **truthfulness** he ascribes to Scripture, inviting his readers into an intellectual ethos marked by **charity** and **clarity**.

#### 8. Legacy and significance within evangelical and Reformed networks
The lasting significance of Woodbridge’s work lies in its dual achievement: a successful refutation of a widely circulated historical claim about **inerrancy**, and the construction of an evangelical research agenda in which **history**, **hermeneutics**, and **systematic theology** collaborate. His books became standard references in debates that continued through the 1990s and 2000s, whether in denominational controversies over **biblical authority** or in seminary curricula addressing **canon** and **hermeneutics**. His influence is especially visible where scholars have pursued a renewed **retrieval** of **patristic** and **Reformation** sources to clarify doctrines of **revelation** and **Scripture** in the face of late modern skepticism.

Within the broader Reformed world, Woodbridge’s portrait of continuity from **Augustine** to **Turretin** to **Warfield** has provided ballast against a revisionist story that would detach evangelicalism from its historic roots. Students and pastors shaped by his work have been equipped to handle the nuanced distinctions between **infallibility**, **inerrancy**, **autographa**, and **textual criticism**, and to engage contemporary theorists of interpretation without sacrificing **sola Scriptura**. His insistence on definitional precision and primary-source engagement has set a methodological standard for evangelical controversy, resisting rumor and appealing to the documentary record.

In sum, Woodbridge’s vocation has been that of a historian-theologian who treated **biblical authority** as a living inheritance rather than a modern invention, and who labored to transmit that inheritance with scholarly care and ecclesial fidelity. His collaborations with **D. A. Carson** amplified his reach, ensuring that hermeneutical and canonical questions were not quarantined from doctrinal reflection. The upshot is a body of work that strengthened evangelical confidence in **Scripture** while deepening intellectual virtue in the church’s teachers.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** standpoint, Woodbridge’s project is substantially aligned with classical commitments to **sola Scriptura**, **autopistia Scripturae**, and the **testimonium Spiritus Sancti internum**, and it renders a valuable historical defense of **inerrancy** as catholic and Reformed. His resistance to equating **Old Princeton** with rationalism is convincing and preserves continuity between **Warfield** and the **Reformed orthodox** like **Turretin**. The natural point of refinement concerns epistemic method. A **Westminster** or **Van Tilian** analysis would affirm Woodbridge’s retrieval while pressing more explicitly the role of **covenantal epistemology**, the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, and the principial self-attestation of **revelation** apart from any dependence on **Common Sense Realism**. Where Woodbridge leans on historical argument to rebut **Rogers/McKim**, a WTS approach would supplement his case by foregrounding the principium of **revelation** as self-authenticating under the Spirit’s witness, the distinction between **principium cognoscendi** and **reason**, and the ministerial use of **evidence** within a presuppositional frame. These are nuances of method rather than substance. Substantively, Woodbridge’s affirmation of **verbal plenary inspiration**, **inerrancy** properly defined with **genre** sensitivity, and **canon** as recognized rather than constituted aligns closely with classical **Reformed orthodoxy** and strengthens the church’s confidence in the **Word of God**.
