### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
S. Joshua Swamidass, an evangelical physician–scientist at **Washington University in St. Louis**, emerged in the late 2010s at the nerve center of the science–religion controversy over **human origins**, **Adam and Eve**, and **evolutionary science**. His work answers a crisis exacerbated by post **Human Genome Project** rhetoric that alleged decisive genetic disproof of a **historical Adam**, a claim amplified within **BioLogos** circles and contested by **Intelligent Design** and **Young Earth Creationists**. Against this cacophony he proposed a conceptual clarification rooted in **population genetics** and the distinction between **genetic ancestry** and **genealogical ancestry**, a distinction developed in modern mathematics by **Joseph Chang** in 1999. His public initiative **Peaceful Science**, launched in 2017, embodies his method: **methodological naturalism** as the civic discipline of science, strict noncommittal on **philosophical naturalism**, and an invitation to confessional communities to test their readings of **Genesis 2–3** and **Romans 5** against publicly accessible evidence.

This method is not theological minimalism but a structured epistemic division of labor. For Swamidass, **science** answers questions within the space of regular causes, while **theology** legitimately addresses **de novo creation**, **miracle**, and the **resurrection** which science does not adjudicate. He frames this as a public ethic for a divided church and academy. The axioms are clear: affirm **common descent** where evidence warrants, affirm limits of inference where **metaphysics** intrudes, and cultivate a civic square where bold theological claims about **original sin**, **federal headship**, and **imago Dei** can be articulated without illicit scientific vetoes.

#### 2. The overlooked science of genealogy
The master key to Swamidass's contribution is the precise difference between **genetic descent** and **genealogical descent**. Genetic descent tracks the small subset of ancestors who contribute DNA to a given person. Genealogical descent tracks all forebears in the family tree. Due to recombination and pedigree collapse, genetic contributions from distant ancestors vanish quickly, while genealogical relatedness proliferates. The mathematics of **universal genealogical ancestors** shows that, given interbreeding and migration typical of human populations, almost everyone alive today shares all ancestors with everyone else a few thousand years ago. The notion of the **identical ancestors point** formalizes this, indicating a time beyond which all individuals are either ancestors of all living humans or of none. Swamidass integrates these concepts into an account of human history that affirms both the vast antiquity of humankind in **paleoanthropology** and a recent **universal genealogical ancestry** compatible with theological claims about **Adam**.

This distinction disarms a frequent category mistake in Christian discourse, namely the assumption that **monogenesis** must be genetic monogenesis. Swamidass redirects the conversation to **genealogical monogenesis**, a form of universal human family describable in terms that are both scientifically tractable and theologically relevant to **Romans 5** and **Acts 17:26**, texts that invoke shared human descent without specifying DNA transmission. The move is conceptually modest yet theologically potent, because **covenant** and **federal headship** operate along genealogical and representative lines, not genetic determinism.

#### 3. The Genealogical Adam and Eve, 2019
Swamidass set out the program in **The Genealogical Adam and Eve** in 2019. The book argues that nothing in mainstream **evolutionary science** rules out a recent, de novo created couple, Adam and Eve, whose descendants intermarried with others and who, by the time of Jesus, had become **universal genealogical ancestors** of everyone alive. The thesis hinges on the speed with which genealogical ancestry becomes universal in large, interbreeding populations. He canvasses simulated pedigrees and the mathematical results of **Chang 1999**, explaining that while most genetic lines extinguish quickly, genealogical ties spread rapidly across populations. The claim is circumscribed. He does not prove de novo creation, nor does he demand concordism about **Genesis 2–3**. He demonstrates that a model often presumed scientifically impossible is in fact scientifically permissible, a crucial reframing for churches seeking to uphold a **historical Adam** alongside **common descent**.

Within the book, Swamidass entertains several configurations. One is a recent **de novo** Adam within the last six to ten millennia, situated in the Near East, whose progeny interbreed with those outside the Garden. Another is an ancient Adam correlated with **Homo heidelbergensis**, the path eventually favored by **William Lane Craig** in 2021, which also remains consistent with universal genealogy. The important throughline is that **genealogical universality** can be secured under varied chronologies, so the logic of **federal headship** and **covenant representation** need not stand or fall with any single paleoanthropological identification. The model thus decouples the theological identity of **Adam** from overburdened genetic claims and reattaches it to **genealogical** and **covenantal** structures already embedded in **Scripture** and **tradition**.

#### 4. Scripture, tradition, and doctrinal retrieval
What does this yield for **systematic theology**. Swamidass construes **Romans 5**, **1 Corinthians 15**, and **Luke 3** as invoking shared human descent and a universal problem of sin tied to a particular progenitor under **federal headship**. On a genealogical account, the universality required for **original sin** and **imputation** is supplied by the fact that all humans are descended from Adam and Eve in the ordinary genealogical sense. This points toward classical **Augustinian** and Reformed frames of **covenant of works**, without commitment to a specific theory of **traducianism** or **creationism** of souls. He delineates scientific limits in a way that grants theologians freedom to argue for corruption of nature, **death in Adam**, and **grace in Christ**, without fear that population genetics has foreclosed the discussion.

Swamidass intentionally resists hard coding a detailed **hamartiology**. He does not define how **original sin** is transmitted, whether mediately through genealogy, immediately through a corrupted nature, or legally through **imputation**. He instead shows how a historically universal Adam remains viable within **evolutionary science**, so that theologians can debate **Genesis 2–3**, **the Fall**, and **atonement** on exegetical and doctrinal grounds. This division of labor exemplifies his methodological conviction that **science is ministerial, not magisterial**, a maxim cherished in many **Reformed** and **evangelical** quarters even when conclusions diverge.

#### 5. Interlocutors and public engagement
The project unfolded through lively engagement with multiple communities. With **BioLogos**, Swamidass challenged prior public statements that science had ruled out a recent universal human couple. His genealogical clarification prompted recalibrations and opened a path for affirming **evolution** while maintaining a **historical Adam**. With **Reasons to Believe**, he conversed about **old earth creationism** and the plausibility of **de novo** events. With **Answers in Genesis**, he acknowledged deep differences over **chronology** and **death before the fall**, while insisting that his model is a bridge rather than a middle-of-the-road compromise. With **Intelligent Design** theorists, he maintained that their critique of **methodological naturalism** is misdirected, since science operates by a limited rule set that does not foreclose **miracle** in theology.

A significant exchange occurred with **William Lane Craig**, whose **In Quest of the Historical Adam** in 2021 argued for an ancient Adam identified with a Middle Pleistocene hominin. Swamidass affirmed the scientific permissibility of Craig's ancient Adam but noted that the genealogical framework also allows more recent placements. He thereby positioned the **genealogical principle** as a common architecture rather than a single-model diktat. Endorsements and critiques from **C. John Collins**, **Hans Madueme**, and others pressed the theological implications for **death**, **morality**, and **race**. Swamidass engaged these critics by emphasizing that **genealogical universality** underwrites the moral unity of humanity, cutting against the history of **polygenism** and its racist abuses.

#### 6. Anthropology, race, and the unity of humankind
One of the book's most pastorally sensitive payoffs is its treatment of **race** and **human unity**. The genealogical framework yields a robust **monogenesis** in an ordinary sense. By the time of Jesus, all living humans were, on the model, descendants of a single couple as well as of many other ancestors. This is not a genetic essentialism but a human family fact that supports the catholic insistence on the single human nature addressed by **incarnation** and **atonement**. It thereby repudiates **polygenist** narratives that historically fed **racial hierarchies** and theological division. Swamidass links this to **Acts 17:26**, all nations from one man, and to the universality of **sin** and **grace** in **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**. The move contributes a measured yet significant resource for evangelical public theology in the wake of renewed attention to **race** and **doctrine of man**.

Anthropological distinctives are handled with similar restraint. Questions of **imago Dei**, **rational soul**, and **ensoulment** are acknowledged as metaphysical theological questions beyond the competence of **population genetics**. Swamidass urges theologians to deliberate on these within their confessional frames while taking the genealogical option seriously as a way to keep **historical Adam** and **evolutionary history** in the same field without confusion.

#### 7. Philosophy of science and civic practice
Beyond the technicalities of ancestry, Swamidass advances a public philosophy he calls a **civic practice of science**. The central convictions are that **methodological naturalism** defines the rules of empirical inquiry, that these rules are contingent and limited, and that the sciences as public institutions should invite **confessional pluralism** to the table. This is not quietism about **miracle**. He affirms the **bodily resurrection** of Jesus as a historical claim that is not in competition with science, since it is a divine act whose attestation belongs to history and testimony rather than to reproducible laboratory protocols. In short, **science** and **theology** address distinct but overlapping orders, and the task is to prevent category mistakes that turn probabilistic models into metaphysical decrees.

This civic stance enables Swamidass to convene experts across divides, including **geneticists**, **biblical scholars**, and **systematic theologians**, around shared facts and clarified terms. It is why **Peaceful Science** functions as a forum where **BioLogos** biologists, **ID** proponents, and **creationists** can argue under conditions of intellectual hospitality. The genealogical project is the flagship instance of this method, demonstrating that some apparent conflicts are artifacts of imprecise categories and that once corrected, room opens for serious doctrinal reasoning about **original sin**, **federal headship**, and **covenant**.

#### 8. Objections and limits
Critiques have targeted several pressure points. Some allege the proposal is **ad hoc**, positing **people outside the garden** to save a traditional Adam. Swamidass replies that anthropology already recognizes a large, ancient human population, so his model does not multiply entities but integrates standard science with a specific theological claim. Others worry about **death before the fall**, arguing that widespread animal death and human mortality in prehistory unsettle readings of **Genesis 3** and the scope of **Romans 5**. Swamidass does not settle these disputes. He insists only that science cannot rule out a theological claim that a first sin event introduced a new moral-spiritual death, or that a historical couple stood as **federal heads** under a **covenant of works**, while natural death had a complex prelude in creation.

Another line of critique presses the relation of **genealogical ancestry** to the ontological transmission of **original sin**. If genealogy is merely a network of relations, how does real corruption of nature arise. Swamidass again declines to legislate, commending instead the range of options from **realist** accounts of inherited nature to **federal** accounts of legal imputation, and signaling that neither option is obstructed by science. The book's constructive modesty is thus both strength and limit. It removes a pseudo-problem but calls theologians to complete the dogmatic work in **hamartiology** and **anthropology**.

#### 9. Enduring contribution and developing discussion
The enduring contribution of Swamidass is twofold. First, a durable conceptual tool, the **genealogical vs genetic** distinction, now widely acknowledged across the spectrum of **evangelical** and **analytic** theology of **Adam**. This tool recalibrates discussions of **monogenesis**, **race**, and **federal headship**, and supports exegetical work on **Romans 5** and **Genesis 2–3** by clearing away spurious scientific impossibilities. Second, a model for **civic engagement** in contested domains, demonstrating that carefully circumscribed science can serve the church without usurping doctrinal authority. Subsequent works like **William Lane Craig's** 2021 tome, responses by **C. John Collins**, and continuing debates in venues such as **Philosophia Christi** and **PSCF** show that the genealogical paradigm is now part of the standard toolbox.

Swamidass's public essays and forums since 2017 continue to explore boundary questions such as **image of God**, **human uniqueness**, and **miracle** in history. His approach encourages theologians to revisit older categories such as **proximate vs remote causation**, **special providence**, and the limits of **natural theology**, while treating **population genetics** as a source of prompts rather than decrees. The fruit is a chastened confidence that complex issues at the intersection of **nature** and **grace**, **creation** and **covenant**, can be handled with both analytical rigor and pastoral care.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Reformed assessment, especially in a **Westminster Theological Seminary** register, can be appreciative yet exacting. On the positive side, Swamidass's distinction between **genealogical** and **genetic ancestry** meaningfully reopens space for a **historical Adam**, **federal headship**, and a **covenant of works** without capitulating to scientism. His insistence that **science is ministerial, not magisterial**, resonates with classic **Reformed** accounts of the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture**. His genealogical pathway bolsters doctrinal commitments to the unity of the human race against **polygenism**, aids the catholic scope of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15**, and removes a widely publicized stumbling block in evangelism and catechesis. Yet several tensions remain. First, the civic construal of **methodological naturalism** risks downplaying the **noetic effects of sin** and the **antithesis** emphasized by **Van Til**, potentially masking how suppressio veritatis shapes public science. A Reformed response can affirm methodological restraint while insisting on principled **epistemic asymmetry** grounded in **revelation**. Second, the openness to **death before the fall** requires careful reformulation of **Romans 5:12** and **Genesis 3**, lest natural and judicial death be conflated. Classical alternatives include a sharper distinction of **physical**, **spiritual**, and **eternal** death, or a model in which **animal death** is part of original creation while human **mortality** is covenantally conditioned. Third, if the genealogical proposal brackets the mechanics of **original sin**, Reformed theology must fill the gap with robust **federal imputation** and corruption of nature, rejecting any reduction of sin to mere genealogical connectedness. Finally, while confessional pluralism has civic value, **Reformed catholicity** demands doctrinal clarity on **creation**, **providence**, and **anthropology**. The best Reformed appropriation will therefore receive Swamidass's genealogical tools as helpful **ministerial instruments**, deploy them in service of **covenantal theology**, and refuse any drift toward therapeutic irenicism that would mute the claims of **special revelation** over the stories we tell about **nature**.
