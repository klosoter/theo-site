### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and disciplinary location
David J. Gunkel emerges in the context of the late twentieth-century ascendancy of **communication theory**, **media studies**, and **continental philosophy**, where **digital technologies** and **networked life** pressed inherited ethical and metaphysical categories to their limits. Working at the intersection of **philosophy of communication** and **technology ethics**, Gunkel’s career arc from the 1990s into the 2020s corresponds to the rise of the **World Wide Web**, the globalization of **remix culture**, and the public arrival of **AI and robotics**. His books with **MIT Press** and **Polity** place him within a cohort that treats ethical controversy not as a downstream application but as a site for conceptual renovation. In this setting, the questions that anchor theology and moral philosophy alike — **What is a person**, **what does responsibility require**, **who is the neighbor** — are translated into idioms of **human-machine communication**, **legal personhood**, and **posthuman subjectivity**.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance: deconstruction as ethics
Gunkel’s method is governed by **deconstruction** interpreted not as destructive skepticism but as the discipline of responding to **aporia**, those forceful impasses where concepts like **person**, **agent**, and **rights-bearer** pull in competing directions. Drawing centrally on **Jacques Derrida’s** analyses of undecidability and the law’s performative constitution, and on **Emmanuel Levinas’s** priority of the **Other** as ethical summons, Gunkel reframes moral inquiry as a practice of **responsibility** rather than a search for metaphysical essences. He consistently resists **substance metaphysics** and **property-based criteria** — intelligence, consciousness, sentience — for moral status, proposing instead a **relational ontology** where obligations arise within interactions and institutional practices. The epistemic stance, therefore, is not to ground ethics in self-evident features of entities but to scrutinize how **normativity** is enacted through **discourse**, **legal operations**, and **technologies** that configure relational fields.

#### 3. The Machine Question: from criteria to relation
In **The Machine Question: Critical Perspectives on AI, Robots, and Ethics** (2012), Gunkel asks whether, and on what grounds, machines might be **morally considerable**. He surveys classical proposals from **Kantian autonomy** to **utilitarian sentience**, noting the **problem of other minds** that haunts any attempt to verify interior states, whether in animals or artifacts. The book deliberately mirrors the earlier **animal question**, staging the analogy between debates over **animal rights** and emerging disputes over **machine agency**. Gunkel’s central move is to expose the circularity of property tests — the **Turing Test**, rationality thresholds, or emotion detection — which presuppose a human paradigm and install asymmetrical gatekeeping. He concludes that moral status, if modeled on intrinsic properties, is both epistemically inaccessible and politically exclusionary. Hence the proposal is to displace property predicates with **responsivity**: we encounter machines within communicative practices and institutional settings that already bind us in **responsibility**. The force of the argument is not that machines have rights by nature, but that our relations may obligate us prior to secure ontological diagnostics.

#### 4. Robot Rights: the performative constitution of standing
Building on this shift, **Robot Rights** (2018) confronts the public policy question of whether robots can or should be **rights-holders**. Gunkel positions the debate between **anti-robotists** who restrict rights to humans and select animals, and **expansionists** who invoke **functional equivalence** or **sentience proxies**. He then advances a signature thesis: rights are not simply discovered but are **performed** in law and social practice. The history of **legal personhood** demonstrates this with **corporations**, **ships**, and even **rivers** granted standing through juridical acts that institute new subjects of responsibility. On this **performative theory of rights**, we should not await a metaphysical verdict on robot interiority, but examine how legal and moral vocabularies distribute obligations and protections. The result is a second displacement: from ontological desert to **juridical enactment**. This does not erase metaphysics; it redescribes it as always already **institutional**. Gunkel thus reframes the normative question as one of prudent design of **rights-regimes**, guided by harms, benefits, and the politics of inclusion and exclusion.

#### 5. Person, Thing, Robot: legal ontology in motion
The trajectory culminates in **Person, Thing, Robot: A Moral and Legal Ontology for the 21st Century** (2022), where Gunkel revisits the Roman law dyad **persona** and **res** to argue that the modern world has never neatly divided entities into **persons** and **things**. The in-between population — **slaves**, **fetuses**, **nonhuman animals**, **corporate entities** — discloses a plastic ontology modulated by legal and social decisions. Gunkel develops a **matrix of statuses** for the twenty-first century in which **robots** may occupy zones of **quasi-personhood** or **instrumental personhood** for the sake of accountability, insurance, and harm mitigation. He critically assesses the European Parliament’s 2017 flirtation with **electronic personhood**, neither embracing symbolic personification uncritically nor retreating to blanket prohibition. The book’s constructive recommendation is to treat **legal ontology** as an area of **design ethics**: we design categories that, in turn, design our world of responsibilities. The interaction between **moral considerability** and **legal fictions** is thus made explicit, with priority given to carefully engineered **institutional mediations**.

#### 6. Of Remixology: authorship, originality, and the ethics of copying
Although best known for machine ethics, Gunkel’s **Of Remixology: Ethics and Aesthetics After Remix** (2016) exemplifies the same methodological commitments in a different domain. Confronting the politics of **copyright**, **authorship**, and **intellectual property**, he deconstructs the romantic image of the **author** and the sacrality of **originality**, mobilizing **Roland Barthes**, **Michel Foucault**, and **Derrida** alongside contemporary case studies from **digital culture**. The thesis is not merely descriptive. He presses an **ethics of remix** that recognizes both the inevitability of **derivation** and the need for **just distribution** of credit and compensation. Here again, the pivot is from essence to practice: **authorship** is constituted in and through **institutional arrangements**, **platform norms**, and **audience reception**. Ethical orientation is therefore not a matter of metaphysical purity but of **responsible participation** in evolving communal rules that are themselves subject to critique and revision.

#### 7. Communication and AI: reframing the problem space
In **An Introduction to Communication and Artificial Intelligence** (2020), Gunkel consolidates these themes for a broader field. He reframes **AI** as an eminently communicative phenomenon, where **interfaces**, **conversational agents**, and **human-machine interaction** redesign social life. The book relocates the classic **Turing Test** in a wider ecology of **communication protocols** and asks how we should understand **agency**, **accountability**, and **meaning** when nonhuman artifacts mediate and sometimes originate messages. The theoretical upshot is a shift from metaphysical speculation to **pragmatics**: we interrogate **speech acts**, **protocol architectures**, and **governance** to determine how ethical responsibilities are signaled and enforced. Gunkel’s ongoing interlocutors — **Heidegger** on technology’s revealing, **Latour** on actor-networks, **Floridi** on information ethics, **Coeckelbergh** on relational moral status — demonstrate a broad, dialogical method that keeps ethics tethered to **practice** while contesting simplistic **anthropocentrisms**.

#### 8. Doctrinal contours: moral considerability, responsibility, and law
Across these major works, several doctrinal contours are clear. First, a critique of **property-based moral status**: tests for consciousness, intelligence, or sentience fail epistemically and reproduce exclusionary regimes. Second, a constructive turn to **relational ethics**: responsibility emerges from the encounter with the **Other**, human or nonhuman, and is concretized in **communicative practice**. Third, a recognition of the **performative power of law**: **rights**, **personhood**, and **standing** are effects of juridical speech that shape moral life as much as they reflect it. Fourth, an insistence on **institutional design**: since categories are made, the ethical task is to make them more just, responsive, and future-proof. Finally, a willingness to embrace **aporia**: undecidability is not paralysis but the crucible of decision, where deconstructive analysis provokes and disciplines the act of judging within limits. The resultant project fuses **Levinasian ethics**, **Derridean jurisprudence**, and **posthuman studies** into a program capable of guiding policy in an era of **AI and robotics**.

#### 9. Theological traction: creation, the neighbor, and the artifact
While not writing as a theologian, Gunkel’s work intersects theology where **anthropology**, **ethics**, and **law** meet. His relational stress resonates with the biblical command to **love the neighbor**, inviting reconsideration of the scope of **neighborliness** in a world mediated by **machines**. The deconstruction of **authorship** parallels theological critiques of **possessive individualism** and opens space for **gift** and **commons** imaginaries. His exposure of **legal personhood** as performative clarifies the difference between **ontological personhood** and **juridical fictions**, a distinction relevant to doctrines of **person and nature** in **Christology** and to debates over corporate agency in **social ethics**. Most provocatively, the proposal to grant **robots** some form of standing presses theological anthropology to articulate the **imago Dei** with renewed precision, distinguishing intrinsic human dignity from instrumental policy devices. By emphasizing **institutional design**, Gunkel places practical wisdom at the center of ethics, a move compatible with Christian commitments to **prudence**, **justice**, and **stewardship** in a fallen but governable world.

#### 10. Reformed/WTS evaluation: Creator, covenant, and kinds
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Gunkel’s relational critique of **property-based moral status** offers a salutary warning against rationalist hubris, echoing **covenantal ethics** in which obligations are constituted by **divine speech**, **vocation**, and **neighbor-love**, not by self-authenticating properties. His emphasis on **institutional performativity** also aligns with **sphere sovereignty** and the recognition that law structures moral life. Yet key tensions remain. First, the extension of **rights** or **quasi-personhood** to **robots** risks eroding the **Creator-creature distinction** and obscuring the ontological uniqueness of the **imago Dei**, which underwrites human dignity and responsibility in **Reformed orthodoxy**. Where Gunkel treats personhood as a malleable legal artifact, classical theology insists on created kinds ordered by **divine providence** and clarified by **special revelation**. Second, **aporia** and perpetual undecidability cannot finally norm the church’s ethics; the **claritas Scripturae** furnishes principled guidance regarding creatures, artifacts, and moral ends. A constructive alternative would maintain Gunkel’s **relational attention** while reframing duties toward machines as mediated obligations to God and neighbor: we owe artifacts not rights recognition but **just use**, **truthful representation**, **risk accountability**, and **care for human and nonhuman creation** impacted by their deployment. In practice, Reformed ethics would endorse robust **regulation**, **liability structures**, and even limited legal fictions for system governance, while rejecting the attribution of intrinsic **personhood** or rights to machines, preserving the moral grammar of **covenant**, **stewardship**, and **human exceptional dignity**.
