### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the turn to ecclesial practice
William H. Willimon emerges as a leading voice of **Methodist practical theology** in the late twentieth century, formed within the crisis of **mainline Protestantism** and the waning cultural dominance of **Christendom**. Born in 1946, educated at **Wofford College**, **Yale Divinity School**, and **Emory University**, he moved quickly from parish ministry to the university pulpit, serving as **Dean of the Chapel at Duke University, 1984 to 2004**, and later as **United Methodist Bishop of North Alabama, 2008 to 2012**. This trajectory tethered his theology to **preaching, liturgy, and pastoral oversight**, marking his abiding conviction that the gospel is known in the church’s **public performance of Word and sacrament** rather than in disembodied theory. In the Duke context, alongside **Stanley Hauerwas** and amid the reflex of **postliberal theology** associated with **George Lindbeck**, Willimon forged a style of **ecclesial apologetics** that proposes the church as a **contrast-society** whose speech and action manifest the **oddness of the gospel**. The institutional challenges of the **United Methodist Church**, including debates on doctrine, discipline, and public witness, became for him not merely administrative problems but theological laboratories for **baptismal identity** and **sanctification** as communal realities.

From the outset, Willimon’s method transposes **John Wesley’s practical divinity** into a contemporary key, privileging the **means of grace** as epistemic. Catechesis, preaching, the **Lord’s Supper**, and pastoral admonition are not applications of a prior theory but the principal media of divine address. His appropriation of **Karl Barth’s** insistence on God’s **self-revelation** is filtered through a homiletic register: the **intrusive Word** breaks human projects and creates a peculiar people. The result is a theology saturated by the cadence of proclamation, a refusal of **natural theology** as the church’s epistemic foundation, and sustained resistance to **liberal Protestant accommodation** to the canons of the nation-state and the therapeutic self.

#### 2. Method as homiletic theology and ecclesial epistemology
Willimon’s signatures are the pairings **sermon and doctrine**, **liturgy and ethics**, **pastor and polity**. In **Peculiar Speech, 1992**, he argues that Christian truth is **performative**: sermons do not primarily inform but make a people capable of praise and obedience. This is a concretization of the ancient maxim **lex orandi lex credendi**, where prayer shapes belief. In **The Intrusive Word, 1994**, he advances a theological account of preaching as God’s own act, a Barthian *Verkündigung* in which divine speech seizes hearers and drafts them into the drama of **redemption**. Against the utilitarian homiletics of church growth and the bland **moralistic therapeutic deism** of late modern religion, Willimon paints proclamation as comic, disruptive, and nonnegotiable. His method is **narrative** yet never merely descriptive; it is **ecclesial** yet not parochial, insisting that the gospel’s content is inseparable from the practices that bear it.

Willimon’s epistemic stance resists the primacy of **experience** as criterion, a hallmark of **liberal Protestantism** that he views as Christologically thin. Yet he is thoroughly **Wesleyan** in viewing Christian knowledge as grace-enabled participation in **holiness**. The means of grace are not passive rites but sites of **sanctifying encounter**, oriented toward the church’s **formation** as a holy community. His debt to **Lesslie Newbigin** appears in a missionary framing of post-Christendom: the West is now a **mission field**, so the church must recover catechesis, hospitality to the stranger, and a fearless **public witness** not constrained by the nation’s civil religion. The work of **Alasdair MacIntyre** on **virtue ethics** hovers in the background via Hauerwas, though Willimon channels it through his concrete attention to the **pastoral office** as custodian of communal habits.

#### 3. A church of resident aliens in post-Christendom
The collaborative **Resident Aliens, 1989** with **Hauerwas** is Willimon’s most influential ecclesial thesis. The book announces the end of **Constantinianism**, narrating a church misled by cultural establishment and summoned anew to be a **resident alien** community whose citizenship is in the **kingdom of God**. This is not quietist sectarianism. Rather it is **ecclesial politics** where the church’s visible disciplines in **baptism**, **Eucharist**, **catechesis**, and **mutual admonition** serve as the politics of the redeemed. Subsequent reflections in **Where Resident Aliens Live, 1996** clarify the call to local congregations: cultivate thick practices, recover **church discipline**, tell the **biblical narrative** in ways that scandalize American civil religion, and expect God’s **eschatological** agency to reorder loyalties.

Within this framework, Willimon reframes pastoral leadership. The pastor is not an institutional chaplain to the culture but an **abbot** of Christ’s colony, directing attention to the **means of grace** as the church’s social strategy. His rhetoric delights in the **oddness of discipleship** as gift rather than burden. The church’s visibility is moral and liturgical before it is programmatic. The congregation does not need techniques to be the church; it needs **faithful preaching**, **reconciled relationships**, and the patience of **sanctification**. The primary public service of the church is the truthful worship of **the triune God**.

#### 4. Pastoral theology: office, formation, and care
In **Worship as Pastoral Care, 1979**, Willimon recovers the liturgy as the church’s primary form of **cure of souls**, countering the professionalization and psychologization of pastoral care. The rites of **baptism**, **confession**, **Eucharist**, and **anointing** embody the church’s grammar for suffering, guilt, reconciliation, and hope. The Eucharistic life breaks the isolation of modern persons by locating care in the body of **Christ’s people** rather than in individual therapy. This program culminates in **Pastor: The Theology and Practice of Ordained Ministry, 2002**, where he offers a comprehensive ecclesiology of **ordination**. The pastor is bearer of the church’s memory and steward of the **gospel’s strangeness**, one who teaches congregations to expect God to act. Organizational competence is subordinated to **doctrinal fidelity** and **liturgical leadership**, and the pastor’s authority is tethered to the **baptismal covenant**.

Willimon’s pastoral proposals are grounded in **Methodist connectionalism**. The **episcopal office** exists to secure doctrinal unity and missionary energy across local congregations, and his own episcopal tenure in **North Alabama** tested these convictions amid the fractious realities of **United Methodist** polity. He prizes **catechesis** for both youth and adults, particularly in the wake of **confirmation** promises, and he views **preaching** as a sacramental-like event that generates the habits needed for **holiness**. He treats **church discipline** not as punitive but as restorative, an exercise in communal sanctification directed toward visible reconciliation.

#### 5. Homiletics and the shape of the Word
Preaching is the nerve center of Willimon’s theology. In **Peculiar Speech** and **The Intrusive Word**, sermons are acts of divine assault that render the congregation a people who can bear the truth. The preacher does not reason her way to God through culture; rather **God addresses** a people through **Scripture** and the Spirit, summoning them to **repentance** and **joy**. Willimon’s homiletic is saturated with **biblical narrative** and refuses a reductive rational apologetic. He writes as a practitioner, offering rhetoric that is comic, epigrammatic, and saturated with **Christological focus**. He prefers **Christus Victor** tones and **resurrection** power to moral exemplarism, insisting that sermons should expect God’s **agency** to break into the assembly.

In this homiletic register, **doctrine** functions as the skeleton of preaching, giving shape to proclamation without becoming mere abstract proposition. He is suspicious of **inerrancy** as a controlling slogan when it truncates the performative authority of Scripture in the church’s worship. Yet he is relentless for **biblical authority** understood as God’s live address in ecclesial space. His motto is that sermons are exercises in **ecclesial imagination**, forming a community to see the world truthfully. This is why he narrates post-Christendom not as loss but as **missionary opportunity** for truthful speech, where **baptismal identity** shields the church from the demands of national liturgies and partisan catechisms.

#### 6. Holiness, sacraments, and Wesleyan retrieval
As a **Wesleyan**, Willimon foregrounds **sanctification** and the **means of grace**. He lifts **baptism** as the basic politics of the church: to be plunged into Christ is to be conscripted into a holy commonwealth. Baptismal promises and congregational vows form the grammar of **membership** and **discipline**, resisting consumer models of belonging. On the **Lord’s Supper**, he underscores communal reconciliation and mission, a participatory ontology where Christ feeds his body into **holiness** and **service**. His Eucharistic vision follows **lex orandi lex credendi**: what the church prays it comes to believe and thus to be.

Holiness is not mere moral improvement but participation in the **sanctifying grace** of God. Willimon retrieves **Wesley’s practical divinity** as a pedagogy of habits, emphasizing corporate disciplines that train desire. He names **prevenient grace** as God’s prior action that awakens sinners and enables response, and he sees **Christian perfection** not as sinless impeccability but as single-hearted love of God and neighbor. His work on sin, such as **Sinning Like a Christian, 2005**, gives a pastoral catechesis on vice and virtue, recurring to the **seven deadly sins** as diagnostic tools in the cure of souls. Throughout, his aim is not psychological relief but ecclesial transformation into **Christlikeness**.

#### 7. Public witness, politics, and race
Willimon’s ecclesiology entails a distinct **public theology**. Because the church is a **resident alien** people, it cannot be chaplain to the nation. From this standpoint, he refuses culture-war capture by either left or right, cultivating instead **ecclesial politics** shaped by intercession, truthful speech, and works of mercy. He believes **the Sermon on the Mount** names the habits of a people trained by **baptism** and **Eucharist**, and he champions **nonviolence** as ordinary discipleship in key with **Hauerwas** and **Bonhoeffer**. He stresses that the church’s policies are its **practices**, and that debate over ethics must be framed by **doctrine**, particularly **Christology** and **ecclesiology**.

A significant trajectory of his later work addresses **race and repentance**. In **Who Lynched Willie Earle, 2017**, he revisits a 1947 lynching in South Carolina through the story of a Methodist pastor’s sermon of rebuke, offering a meditation on **sin, complicity, and pastoral courage**. Here Willimon shows how **preaching** can function as public judgment and gospel invitation. His method persists: it is the church’s **Word and sacrament** that form a people fit for public truthfulness. He warns that the church often has no gospel for America because it has been too American, a line that encapsulates his **anti-Constantinian** alarm and his hope for **repentant witness**.

#### 8. Style, pedagogy, and prolific ministry
Willimon’s style blends **scholarly clarity** with **pastoral wit**, earning a reputation as one of America’s most read **preachers**. He is a prolific author whose essays and books, including **Accidental Preacher, 2019**, function as catechesis for pastors and lay leaders. He writes as a teacher of **habitus**, giving congregations and ministers a repertoire of practices, stories, and doctrinal cues. His pedagogy is dialogical and practical, often accompanied by resources for **confirmation**, **pastoral visitation**, and **church leadership**. This breadth flows from his conviction that theology belongs to the church’s everyday speech and that **doctrine** blossoms only within **worship** and **pastoral care**. The consistent anchors of his corpus are **baptismal identity**, **Word-centered proclamation**, **ecclesial distinctiveness**, and **missionary realism**.

Across decades, Willimon keeps returning to three refrains that give his project its coherence. First, the gospel is **news** before it is advice, and preaching must be accordingly doxological and **Christocentric**. Second, the church is **a people** before it is a program, so practices shape and secure **truthfulness**. Third, pastors are **theological leaders** before they are managers, charged with guarding the **oddness of grace**. The fruit is a body of work that, while not systematic in form, operates with a clear and durable **dogmatic sensibility**.

#### 9. Doctrinal profile and developments across time
While Willimon is not a dogmatics writer, he exhibits a recognizable **doctrinal profile**. His **theology proper** is resolutely **trinitarian**, though he rarely engages **divine attributes** with scholastic precision. His **Christology** affirms **incarnation, cross, and resurrection** with a soteriological accent on **liberation and sanctification** rather than on a detailed account of **penal substitution**. His **pneumatology** is practical, identifying the **Spirit’s work** with the formation of a holy people through **Word and sacrament**. His **ecclesiology** is robust and concrete, with emphasis on **baptismal covenant**, **Eucharistic community**, and **episcopal oversight**. His **Scripture** doctrine is high in authority as living address but reticent to employ **inerrancy** language if it undermines the homiletic and liturgical telos of the text.

There is development. The early Willimon of **Worship as Pastoral Care** countered the psychologized pastorate by centering **liturgy** as care. The collaborative **Resident Aliens** sharpened the **post-Christendom** thesis and launched a generation of **ecclesial ethics**. The mature **Pastor** integrated his homiletic and ecclesial vision into a coherent theology of **ordination** and **leadership**. Later work on **race and repentance** exhibits an intensified attention to **public sin** and **pastoral courage**. Throughout, the through-line is **the intrusive Word** that makes a people. The idiom is Methodist and Barthian, with **Wesleyan holiness** and **Barth’s oddness of the gospel** jointly steering the ship.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed and Westminster** vantage, Willimon’s project displays winsome strengths and real tensions. Positively, his insistence on **Word-centered proclamation**, his recovery of **church as contrast-society**, and his elevation of **ordinary means of grace** resonate with classic Reformed commitments. His anti-Constantinian reading of **post-Christendom** dovetails with a robust **pilgrim ecclesiology**, and his pastoral retrieval of **discipline** and **catechesis** honors the Reformed conviction that **doctrine shapes life**. Yet tensions appear. His **Wesleyan prevenient grace** and openness to **Christian perfection** lean synergistic, in friction with **monergistic regeneration** and the **ordo salutis** centered on **effectual calling**. His preference for **narrative and performative authority** occasionally sidelines **doctrinal propositional clarity**, risking a flattening of **Scripture’s sufficiency** into liturgical function. His soft-pedaling of **inerrancy** language may prove unstable where **biblical authority** is contested, and his accent on **episcopal polity** sits uneasily beside **presbyterial governance** with its shared eldership. On atonement, his rhetoric gravitates to **Christus Victor** and moral transformation more than to **penal substitution** grounding **justification by faith alone**. A Reformed alternative would appropriate Willimon’s **resident aliens** ecclesial witness while anchoring it in **covenant theology**, strengthening **law-gospel distinction**, articulating **justification and adoption** with forensic clarity, and binding the **means of grace** to the **Word’s sufficiency** in a doctrine-forward homiletic. Even so, Reformed readers can gratefully receive his call to pastors to be **theologians of the pulpit** and his unembarrassed summons for the church to be **a peculiar people**.
