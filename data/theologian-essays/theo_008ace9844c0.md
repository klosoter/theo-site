### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Jeffrey J. Meyers enters contemporary Reformed theology as a pastor-theologian whose enduring contribution lies in crafting a thick account of **covenant renewal worship** within a Presbyterian frame, while advancing a pastoral synthesis of **biblical typology**, **sacramental efficacy**, and **ecclesial identity**. His ministerial career within the **Presbyterian Church in America** placed him at the fault line of late twentieth-century debates over **worship**, **sacramental theology**, and the **Federal Vision**. Trained in classic Reformed sources yet shaped by **James B. Jordan’s** biblical-theological program and the **Biblical Horizons** network, Meyers adopted a consciously doxological method. He reads Scripture with an eye for **Levitical patterns**, **liturgical ascent**, and the structural grammar of **call, confession, consecration, communion, commissioning**, refusing to segregate exegesis from ritual form. The animating conviction is that the Lord’s Day is not merely a venue for didactic instruction but the church’s participation in Christ’s **heavenly liturgy** and **covenant renewal**.

Meyers’ method is resolutely ecclesiocentric. He stresses the **dialogical principle** of worship as divine address and human response, foregrounding the church’s identity as a **called assembly** bound by **oath** and nourished by **Word and sacrament**. His engagement with **Calvin’s** Strasbourg-Geneva liturgies, **Cranmer’s** reformed catholicity, and the Reformed **Directory for Public Worship** is selective yet earnest; he pairs these with typological readings of **Leviticus** and **Hebrews** to plot the movement from sacrifice to Eucharistic peace. In this sense his method is neither narrowly scholastic nor idiosyncratically experiential; it is a **liturgical biblical theology** that pursues a doxological *forma mentis*, convinced that **liturgy** both presupposes and forms **orthodoxy**.

#### 2. The Lord’s Service and the architecture of renewal
Meyers’ central statement, **The Lord’s Service: The Grace of Covenant Renewal Worship** first published in 2003 and later revised in 2019, argues that Reformed worship must be architected by the covenant’s own grammar. The fivefold sequence — **Call to Worship**, **Confession and Absolution**, **Consecration by the Word**, **Communion at the Table**, **Commissioning with Benediction** — is not liturgical ornament but the enacted form of **covenant renewal**. Here Meyers appropriates **Leviticus** as a canonical tutor: the transition from purification to ascension to communion offerings teaches the church how God draws near to his people. The congregation is ritually moved from death to life, from guilt to peace, culminating in **Eucharistic communion** as covenant meal in the presence of the **ascended Christ**.

The volume advances a strong retrieval of **weekly Communion**, robust **psalmody**, standing and kneeling as bodily agreement with **confession and thanksgiving**, and the confession of the **Apostles’** or **Nicene Creed** as covenant oath. Against a prevailing **revivalist** or **didactic-only** ethos, Meyers insists the service is not primarily lecture but **sacrificial liturgy** governed by **Scripture** and the **Regulative Principle of Worship** as rightly understood. He critiques a reductive RPW that shrinks worship to minimal elements and substitutes spontaneity for God-given form, offering instead a positive account of biblical **rite** and **rite-shaped exegesis**. Scripture’s form and content belong together; the church’s **habitus** must echo the canon’s own patterned speech.

#### 3. Sacramental objectivity and covenant membership
Closely tied to liturgy is Meyers’ sacramental theology. He argues for the **objectivity of the covenant**, insisting that **baptism** truly incorporates a person into the visible **body of Christ** and confers real, covenantal benefits that are not reducible to an invisible decree. This emphasis, shared by several **Federal Vision** writers, presses the Reformed axiom of **sign and seal** into an ecclesial ontology: baptized members are genuinely in Christ’s **covenant sphere**, obliged to loyalty, nourished by **Word and Supper**, and capable of falling under covenantal **judgment** for **apostasy**. The benefits of union are not strictly coextensive with **decretal election**; rather, the **means of grace** communicate Christ according to God’s promise, with varying fruitfulness in the **ordo salutis**.

On the Lord’s Supper, Meyers rejects **Zwinglian memorialism** and advocates robust **sacramental efficacy** in covenant terms. The Supper is a **covenant meal** that enacts communion with the risen Lord and strengthens faith. He has been associated with the advocacy of **paedocommunion**, arguing that baptized children, as covenant members, ought not be withheld the covenant meal. While conceding that Reformed churches differ on admission practices, Meyers presses the theological coherence of familial covenant status, table inclusion, and **1 Corinthians 10–11** read within a liturgical-covenantal horizon.

#### 4. Justification, obedience, and the contested grammar of faith
Meyers’ soteriological idiom operates within a covenantal register that foregrounds **union with Christ**, **objective membership**, and the reality of **final judgment according to works**. While affirming **sola fide** and the **imputed righteousness** of Christ in justification, he stresses that the covenant has a public and juridical character: faith is a living allegiance, not a bare notion. In various public statements and essays linked to the **Federal Vision** conversation, Meyers seeks to maintain the Reformed distinction between the **instrumentality** of faith in justification and the **necessity** of Spirit-wrought obedience in **sanctification**, yet he refuses to abstract justification from the total shape of the covenant life. The danger, as critics see it, is that covenantal objectivity and an emphasis on **faithfulness** can blur the forensic clarity of **justification by faith alone** and recalibrate assurance around ecclesial status.

Meyers responds by recentering the liturgy: the gospel is audibly and visibly declared in absolution and at the Table; assurance is nurtured through the church’s **ritual proclamation** of Christ’s finished work. He resists any antinomian inference by casting obedience as covenant gratitude and loyalty to the **Lord’s enthroned grace**, rather than as merit. The resulting soteriological grammar is integrative and ecclesial, aiming to bind **historia salutis** and **ordo salutis** through the church’s actual rites.

#### 5. Biblical theology, wisdom, and typological exegesis
Beyond liturgy, Meyers has contributed to biblical theology through commentary and teaching, notably in **Ecclesiastes Through New Eyes: A Table in the Mist** in 2011. Here he deploys **typology** and **intertextuality** influenced by **James B. Jordan** to read **Qoheleth** as royal wisdom wrestling with life *under the sun* yet ordered by temple-centered theology. The refrain of vanity is not nihilism but a call to receive the world as sacramental gift under God’s **covenant governance**, culminating in fear of the Lord and fidelity to his **commandments**. The commentary’s method accentuates literary structure, symbolic architecture, and canonical echoes, embedding wisdom within **creation-covenant** coordinates and the hope of **eschatological communion**.

This typological habit of mind pervades Meyers’ preaching and teaching. He finds **Levitical** forms in the Gospels and **ascensional** patterns in the Psalms, reads **Hebrews** as a manual of priestly transformation, and insists that such **figural reading** is not decorative but expresses Scripture’s native idiom. His work is pastoral in aim but confident in theological breadth, seeking to nurture congregations as communities formed by **biblical rites**, saturated in **psalms**, and anchored in the **resurrectional Lord’s Day**.

#### 6. Ecclesiology, calendar, and public discipleship
Meyers’ ecclesiology is covenantal and public. The church is the **city of God** locally assembled, visible and audible as a people placed under **oath** and **benediction**. He commends recovery of aspects of the **church year** and the **Lord’s Day** as festal summit, to train affections and pattern time by **Christ’s paschal victory**. Liturgical space and time are for him catechetical instruments that craft an **ecclesial habitus** capable of resisting **consumer liturgies** and **therapeutic individualism**. He commends the ministry of elders and the diaconate in visibly administering the **means of grace** and **charity**, stressing that discipline and hospitality both flow from the covenant’s objective claims.

These commitments yield a pastoral program: serious catechesis, a renewed **household piety** keyed to the Sunday assembly, psalm-rich singing, and embodied practices such as kneeling at confession and standing for the gospel. Meyers criticizes **revivalist** and **performance-driven** services for evacuating covenant form and reducing the church to a pedagogical platform or a concert hall. The remedy is not antiquarian ritualism but a principled, Scripture-formed **ordo** whose governing telos is the church’s ascent by the Spirit to the Father through the Son.

#### 7. Controversy and reception within the Reformed world
Meyers’ positions on **covenant objectivity**, **paedocommunion**, and the covenantal framing of **justification** placed him within, and sometimes at the center of, the **Federal Vision** controversies that crested in North American Presbyterianism in the early 2000s. The **PCA** General Assembly’s 2007 report on the **Federal Vision and New Perspective on Paul** adopted theological declarations designed to protect the **Westminster** doctrine of justification, the **covenant of works**, and sacramental theology. Within this setting, Meyers was examined by his **presbytery** and issued clarifications of his teaching. His presbytery judged his views to be within confessional bounds, a decision that drew attention in the wider communion and prompted review by higher courts. The long procedural history became a flashpoint for debates over confessional subscription, **visible-invisible church** distinctions, and the semantics of **union with Christ** in the **Standards**.

Reception has been dual. On the one hand, critics like **Guy Prentiss Waters** and **R. Scott Clark** warned that the Federal Vision’s language about covenant membership, the **instrumentality** of faith, and admission to the **Table** threatened Reformed clarity on **forensic justification** and perseverance. On the other hand, many pastors and congregations have embraced Meyers’ liturgical vision, adopting **weekly Communion**, the **dialogical** structure of the service, and psalm-rich song, even where they resist his sacramental or federal particulars. Thus Meyers’ legacy in worship far exceeds the polemical margins of the FV debate.

#### 8. Pedagogical influence and institutional footprint
Meyers’ influence radiates through conferences, pastoral mentorship, and collaborations with institutions committed to biblical-theological formation such as **Biblical Horizons** and the **Theopolis Institute**. He models a pastor as theologian whose primary laboratory is the Lord’s Day **liturgy** and whose exegesis is tested in congregational rite. His work has catalyzed a generation of ministers to think of worship not as discrete elements aggregated for convenience, but as a sacramental **ascent** that is both covenantal and evangelical. Even among those wary of **Federal Vision** formulations, his retrieval of **Calvin’s sacramental piety**, advocacy of **creedal confession**, and command of **patristic** and **Reformed** liturgical sources have earned respect.

Moreover, his writing on **wisdom literature** and preaching exemplifies a pastoral hermeneutic in which **typology** serves proclamation rather than displacing **grammatical-historical** controls. Where some see an overextension of figural reading, others see a disciplined attempt to let canonical form govern homiletical shape. In this sense, Meyers’ corpus functions as a case study in the contemporary renewal of **liturgical theology** within confessional Protestantism.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Meyers’ contributions can be appreciated and qualified in principled ways. Positively, his retrieval of the **dialogical principle**, the fivefold **covenant renewal** structure, **weekly Communion**, and psalm-rich worship strengthens a Word-and-sacrament piety consonant with **Calvin’s** eucharistic ideal and the **Standards** emphasis on the **means of grace**. His resistance to **revivalism**, his aim to cure **Zwinglian** reductions, and his insistence that liturgy forms doctrine are welcome correctives. Likewise, his typologically sensitive, ecclesial reading of **Leviticus**, **Hebrews**, and **wisdom literature** advances a robust **biblical theology** that can fruitfully coexist with confessional commitments.

Yet tensions remain. Meyers’ idiom of **objective covenant** risks conflating sacramental union with **decretal election**, thereby softening the **visible-invisible church** distinction that secures assurance in the forensic finality of Christ’s righteousness. His advocacy or openness to **paedocommunion** runs against the **Westminster** understanding of admission grounded in **self-examination** and catechesis, as reflected in the **Larger Catechism** on the Supper. At the level of justification, care is needed to preserve the categorical difference between the **imputed righteousness** of Christ received by the sole instrument of faith and the necessary fruit of **Spirit-wrought obedience**, lest talk of **final judgment according to works** slide into an unstable formulation of twofold instrumentality. Methodologically, his strong **typology** should be disciplined by transparent **grammatical-historical** exegesis so that liturgical conclusions are demonstrably textual and not merely suggestive. A constructive alternative within classical Reformed orthodoxy would be to retain Meyers’ liturgical architecture and sacramental seriousness while sharpening the **covenant of works/covenant of grace** distinction, reaffirming **sola fide** in its exclusively forensic scope, upholding confessional practice on **admission to the Table**, and ensuring the **Regulative Principle** governs not only elements but also the rationale for ceremonies. With these calibrations, Meyers’ doxological vision can be received as a potent aid to Reformed renewal without compromising the confessional grammar of **grace**, **assurance**, and **worship**.
