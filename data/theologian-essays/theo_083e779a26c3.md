### ESSAY
Scott J. Hafemann’s enduring contribution to contemporary **evangelical biblical theology** is to restate the Reformation’s soteriological core within the thick texture of **covenant** and **mission**: God’s **promises** create and sustain **obedience** by the **Spirit** so that the church displays God’s **glory** in and through **suffering**. Formed by study in Germany under **Peter Stuhlmacher** and teaching appointments across the American and British academies, Hafemann inhabits a space where close **Greek exegesis** meets canonical **theological synthesis**. His work on **2 Corinthians**, the **letter/Spirit** contrast, and the **new covenant** establishes a new center of gravity for Pauline ethics, anchoring justification’s gift to the Spirit’s transformative **agency** without ceding the Reformation’s confession of **grace alone**. The institutions in which he taught, such as **Wheaton**, **Gordon-Conwell**, and **St Andrews**, contextualize his scholarship between confessional commitments and rigorous dialogue with **critical scholarship**.

Methodologically, Hafemann’s approach is salvation-historical and covenantal, explicitly framed by **promise and fulfillment**. He reads Scripture as a unified witness, yet he resists facile harmonization by attending to the diachronic movement from **Sinai** to **Zion**, and from the **old covenant** to the **new covenant**. The key is that the **Spirit** does not deliver the church from obedience but unto obedience, the **hypakoe pisteos** that Paul announces in Romans 1:5 and 16:26. Hafemann’s method thus refuses both **legalism** and **antinomianism**, since the law written on stone that condemns is now written by the **Spirit** on hearts that love. In the background stand **Reformed** categories of the **covenant of grace**, the **third use of the law**, and a Vosian **redemptive-historical** outlook, yet Hafemann articulates these from inside the Pauline text rather than from a dogmatic superstructure. The control texts are **Exodus 19–34**, **Jeremiah 31**, **Ezekiel 36–37**, and **2 Corinthians 3–5**, read intertextually and with attention to lexical and thematic co-texts, particularly **doxa**, **diatheke**, **gramma/pneuma**, and **dikaiosyne**.

The earliest and most programmatic expression of this method appears in the monograph **Paul, Moses, and the History of Israel** published in 1995. Here Hafemann argues that the infamous **letter/Spirit** contrast in **2 Corinthians 3** is not a Platonic or allegorical hermeneutical opposition, nor simply **law** versus **gospel** in abstraction, but a salvation-historical contrast between the **old covenant’s** mediated glory that condemns and the **new covenant’s** direct, transformative glory that creates righteousness by the **Spirit**. The **veil of Moses** signifies the transitory and death-dealing effect of the **Sinai** administration upon a hardened Israel, whereas the unveiled face of the church beholds and is transformed into the image of Christ’s **glory**. Hafemann’s exegesis probes the rhetorical flow from **2 Corinthians 2:14–3:18**, arguing that Paul’s defense of his apostolic ministry turns the Corinthians away from surface criteria of power to the paradox of **power-in-weakness**, the visible sign that the **Spirit** is at work. This reading rebuts both a purely **apocalyptic Paul** that severs continuity with Israel and a purely **legal** reading that misrecognizes the newness of **pneuma** as the eschatological gift.

The pastoral and theological payoff of this exegesis is developed for a broader audience in **2 Corinthians** in the NIV Application Commentary (2000). There Hafemann refracts the major result of his research into accessible meditations on **power in weakness**, the **ministry of reconciliation**, and the **judgment seat of Christ**. His comment on **2 Corinthians 5:10** underscores that future **judgment according to works** does not annul **justification by faith**, but rather confirms the Spirit’s creation of **obedience** as the evidence of genuine faith. He is careful to disentangle what is meritorious from what is evidentiary, reaffirming **sola fide** while insisting, against soft **antinomian** trends, that the **new covenant** actually produces the life it promises. The movement from the **indicative** of salvation to the **imperative** of sanctification is, for Hafemann, internally bonded by the **Spirit**, not externally imposed by law left as letter.

The theological synthesis that makes his work so generative appears in **The God of Promise and the Life of Faith** (2001). The thesis is terse and pervasive: God’s **promises** are the means by which God motivates and sustains the **obedience of faith**, so that salvation’s **telos** is the display of God’s **glory** through a holy people. In this, Hafemann stands in conversation with **John Piper’s** emphasis on **future grace**, yet he grounds the dynamic in the texture of **covenant**: the **Abrahamic promise** creates a people for the nations; the **Sinai commission** orders their life for mission; the **new covenant** internalizes this vocation by the **Spirit**. He thus redeploys the Reformed law-gospel grammar within the larger story of Scripture’s **missio Dei**. The controlling category is not a bare contract but a relational bond in which **divine promise** and **human obedience** are asymmetrically joined, the latter always a fruit of the former, never its basis. Here the **third use of the law** is no appendix but a structural implication of the **new covenant** itself.

Hafemann’s editorial projects consolidate this vision into a program for the guild. In **Biblical Theology: Retrospect and Prospect** (2002) he maps trajectories emerging from **Vos**, **Ridderbos**, and canonical approaches, commending a disciplined **intertextual** reading that honors both the historical particularity of the **Testaments** and the unity of **Christological fulfillment**. With **Paul R. House** he edits **Central Themes in Biblical Theology** (2007), a collection that treats **temple**, **kingdom**, **mission**, **covenant**, and **presence**, each rendered through the lens of **promise** and **obedience**. The emphasis on the **temple** as the locus of God’s **glory** dovetails with his **2 Corinthians** motif that the church, bearing the **Spirit**, becomes the site of transformative presence in the world. Across these works, he exhibits a refusal to isolate **systematic theology** from **exegesis**, even as he speaks in categories, like **union with Christ**, **righteousness**, and **sanctification**, that dogmatics recognizes.

Interlocutors populate Hafemann’s pages with fruitful friction. Against **E. P. Sanders’s** model of **covenantal nomism**, he affirms that ancient Judaism indeed joined **grace** and **obedience**, yet he contends that Paul unmasks Israel’s incapacity under the **old covenant** apart from the **Spirit**. Against **J. D. G. Dunn** and **N. T. Wright**, he acknowledges sociological boundary-markers but insists that Paul’s polemic reaches the deeper forensic bondage of humanity under **sin** and **death**, not merely ethnic **exclusion**. In dialogue with **Richard B. Hays** on **intertextuality**, Hafemann affirms the echoic texture of Paul’s letters but resists any reading that subordinates the concrete **covenant-historical** storyline to literary pattern. In the German background, **Stuhlmacher** and the legacy of **Hengel** give him the tools of historical realism without the skepticism of **Bultmann**, enabling him to speak of **promise** and **fulfillment** without collapsing them into mythic time.

Suffering functions as the cruciform seal of authenticity in Hafemann’s vision of apostolic ministry. In **2 Corinthians 2–4** he explicates the paradox of the **triumphal procession**: Paul is simultaneously a conquered captive and the bearer of **fragrance** that reveals God’s victory. The shape of ministry is therefore **power in weakness** because the **Spirit’s** power is most evidently not from us. This cruciform model counters prosperity readings of **glory** and banishes the Corinthian itch for rhetorical **success**. Pastors bear the **new covenant** by embodying the **obedience of faith** that trusts God’s **promises** in the valley of affliction. Theologically, this integrates **sanctification** and **mission**: suffering advances the **gospel** by displaying the superior worth of God’s **glory** over the world’s goods. The ethical upshot is non-optional: the church’s holiness is not a private discipline but the public manifestation of the **new covenant**.

Hafemann’s contributions also include decisive clarifications on contentious texts. On **2 Corinthians 3**, he resists any notion that the **old covenant** was graceless. It was glorious, because God is glorious, but its effect in history, because of human hardness, was condemnation, thus a **ministry of death**. The **new covenant** is superior not because it rejects **law** but because the **Spirit** inscribes God’s will within, fulfilling **Jeremiah 31** and **Ezekiel 36**. On **Galatians** and **Romans**, the motif of the **obedience of faith** binds the inclusio of the letter and signals that justificatory faith is living, **Spirit-wrought faith**. On **final judgment**, he sides with a Reformed consensus that distinguishes the **instrumental cause** of justification, **faith alone**, from the **demonstrative necessity** of works, thereby disarming misreadings that collapse assurance into self-observation.

Historically, Hafemann belongs to a generation of evangelical scholars who welcomed the **New Perspective**’s retrieval of Judaism’s covenantal texture without conceding Paul’s radical critique of human incapacity. His work helps re-center debates about **Paul and the law** on the **new covenant** and the **Spirit**, steering between an older Protestant biblicism that flattened **Sinai** into sheer works and revisionist proposals that marginalized **forensic justification**. His polemical tone is measured; he prefers demonstration by **exegesis**. Yet he is not shy about doctrinal stakes. The stakes are neither small nor temporary: the integrity of **sola fide**, the reality of **sanctification**, the church’s **mission**, and the public display of God’s **glory**.

From a Reformed and WTS-style evaluation, Hafemann’s program yields significant strengths and a few tensions. Positively, his insistence that **divine promise** generates **Spirit-wrought obedience** offers a biblically rich account of the **ordo salutis** within a **historia salutis** frame, deeply consonant with **Vos** and **Gaffin** on the inseparability of union, justification, and sanctification. His account of **2 Corinthians 3** avoids antinomian misreadings and honors the **third use of the law** as intrinsic to the **new covenant**. His exegesis of **power in weakness** provides a theologia crucis consonant with **Calvin’s** pastoralia. Tensions arise where his salvation-historical concentration on **Sinai** can under-specify classic distinctions such as the **covenant of works** and debates about **republication** at Sinai, distinctions valued in **Westminster** theology to protect the forensic freeness of **justification**. Moreover, while Hafemann clearly affirms **sola fide**, his robust emphasis on **obedience as evidence** invites the pastoral need to clarify grounds of assurance and the relation of **faith’s instrumentality** to the necessity of **good works**. A WTS alternative would integrate his promise-driven ethics more explicitly with **union with Christ** as the doctrinal nexus that secures both the once-for-all verdict of **imputation** and the ongoing **Spirit-wrought renewal**, while letting the law-gospel distinction function as a hermeneutical and pastoral grid rather than a textual master key. Even so, Hafemann’s covenantal, Spirit-centered, glory-suffused vision stands as a salutary correction to both reductionist forensicism and pragmatic moralism, offering the church a Reformed biblical theology where **promise**, **Spirit**, **obedience**, and **mission** coinhere.
