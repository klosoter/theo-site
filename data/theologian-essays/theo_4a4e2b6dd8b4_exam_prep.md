### TITLE
The **Cappadocian Fathers** secured Nicene Trinitarian orthodoxy by giving the church a careful language of one *ousia* and three *hypostaseis*, yet their essence–energies pattern and sacramental-ascetical piety require critical Reformed retrieval.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- The **Cappadocian Fathers** of the fourth century, **Basil of Caesarea**, **Gregory of Nazianzus**, and **Gregory of Nyssa**, worked in the post‑**Nicaea** consolidation period leading to **Constantinople 381**.
- They labored in the Eastern half of the empire, in **Cappadocia** and **Constantinople**, against **Arianism**, **Eunomian Anomoeanism**, and emerging **Apollinarian** tendencies.

- Methodologically they combined **Nicene Scripture exegesis** with a strongly philosophical vocabulary drawn from **Middle Platonism** and **Aristotelian** categories.
- They saw the **church’s creed and liturgy** as authoritative norms for Trinitarian language, while allowing **apophatic theology** to stress divine incomprehensibility.
- They practiced a spiritual and ascetical **theologia**, where knowledge of **God** is tied to purification and participation in **grace** through the church.

- In **Basil’s** *Against Eunomius* (c. 364–380) and *On the Holy Spirit* (c. 375), he defends the **Son’s** and **Spirit’s** full deity and articulates the key distinction between **ousia** and **hypostasis**.
- In **Gregory of Nazianzus’s** *Theological Orations* (c. 380), he refines Nicene **Trinitarian** language, insists that what is not assumed is not healed, and guards the mystery of **Christology**.
- In **Gregory of Nyssa’s** *Against Eunomius* (c. 380–383) and *On Not Three Gods* (late 370s), he synthesizes **Trinity** and unity through the notion of one divine **energeia** and develops themes of **deification**.
- In **Gregory of Nyssa’s** *Life of Moses* (late 4th century), he offers a spiritual theology of ascent, stressing **infinite progression**, **holiness**, and contemplative knowledge of God.

- Their primary doctrinal significance is in the **Trinity**, especially the formula one *ousia* three *hypostaseis* and the consubstantial **Spirit**.
- They decisively shape **Christology**, anticipating the language of **Chalcedon** by insisting on the full humanity and full deity of Christ and the unity of the person.
- They influence doctrines of **revelation** and **theological language** through their defense of the ineffable divine essence and analogical, doxological speech.
- They become sources for Eastern Orthodox understandings of **grace**, **deification**, and the **church’s** sacramental life.

- A Westminster committee will want you to affirm the **Cappadocians** as foundational for ecumenical **Trinitarian** and **Christological** orthodoxy while flagging problems where later Eastern **essence–energies** and theosis trajectories go beyond Scripture.
- Examiners will press you to show how **Reformed scholastics** like **Bavinck** and **Turretin** affirm the Cappadocian core while rejecting an ongoing mystical ascent and overly negative **apophaticism**.

- For comparison, you should be ready to contrast **Cappadocians vs Augustine** on the Trinity, especially **East** relational taxis versus **Augustinian** psychological analogy.
- You should be prepared to compare **Cappadocians vs Aquinas and the Reformed** on **simplicity**, **energies**, and the nature of **natural theology**.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
The **Cappadocian Fathers** are three closely related bishops of the fourth century, **Basil of Caesarea** (c. 330–379), his brother **Gregory of Nyssa** (c. 335–c. 395), and their friend **Gregory of Nazianzus** (c. 329–390). They were formed in the Greek East after the **Council of Nicaea 325**, in a world where Arianism persisted in sophisticated new forms such as **Eunomian Anomoeanism**. Educated in **classical rhetoric and philosophy** at places like Athens and Constantinople, they returned to the East to serve as monks, pastors, and bishops in Cappadocia, especially in **Caesarea**, **Nyssa**, and **Nazianzus**, with Gregory of Nazianzus eventually serving briefly as bishop of **Constantinople**. Their context is not the first clash with Arianism, but the consolidation of Nicene doctrine leading to **Constantinople 381**, where their categories become normative.

The driving problem that animates their theology is how to defend the full deity of the **Son** and **Spirit** while preserving the monarchy of the **Father** and the unity of the one **God**. The Nicene term *homoousios* had been adopted in 325, but its precise meaning in relation to *hypostasis* was still unclear, and opponents like **Eunomius** accused Nicenes of tritheism or of denying divine simplicity. The Cappadocians sought a conceptual grammar that would safeguard Nicene confession against such attacks while honoring the exegetical data of **Scripture**. Their burden is to say that the Father, Son, and Spirit are truly distinct, not mere modes, yet not three gods, and this is the background for their famous formula of one **ousia** and three **hypostaseis**, as seen throughout **Basil’s** *Against Eunomius* and **Gregory of Nyssa’s* *On Not Three Gods*.

In addition, they are responding to a pastoral and spiritual crisis. For **Basil**, the Arian controversy threatened the unity and holiness of the **church**, which he sought to restore through monastic reform, liturgical renewal, and clear doctrinal teaching in works like *On the Holy Spirit*. For **Gregory of Nazianzus**, the issue is also one of reverent doxology: how can the church worship the Father through the Son in the Holy Spirit if the Son and Spirit are seen as creatures. For **Gregory of Nyssa**, the driving theological problem also includes anthropology and redemption: only if Christ is fully God and fully man can the human race be restored, and only if the Spirit is fully God can believers be sanctified and deified. These concerns press them beyond minimal anti‑Arian formulas toward a rich vision of **Trinity**, **Christology**, and the spiritual life.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
The Cappadocians operate with a fundamentally ecclesial and scriptural method, yet expressed with **philosophical** precision. For **Basil**, in *On the Holy Spirit*, the key authority is the worship and doxology of the **church**, grounded in **Scripture**. He argues from liturgical practice, such as the doxology “Glory be to the Father with the Son together with the Holy Spirit,” to the conclusion that the **Spirit** must share the same divine rank as the Father and Son. Scripture provides the material content of doctrine, but inherited creeds and doxologies function as a rule of faith that guides exegesis. The Cappadocians show a confidence in the clarity of biblical revelation about the **Trinity**, while also insisting that human language can never comprehend the divine essence.

Their understanding of **revelation** places strong emphasis on the distinction between the unknowable divine **essence** and the knowable divine **operations** or *energeiai*. **Gregory of Nyssa**, in *Against Eunomius*, opposes Eunomius’s claim to know the essence of God as unbegotten, insisting that such essential knowledge is impossible for creatures. Instead, we know God by his works, especially in salvation history, and most of all in the incarnate **Christ** and the sanctifying **Spirit**. This is both an affirmation of revelation and a robust **apophatic theology** that stresses the darkness of unknowing as believers ascend into communion with God. Here the Cappadocians combine biblical history with a metaphysical account of God in ways that later Eastern Orthodox theology, including the **Palamite essence–energies distinction**, will develop, although the precise Palamite form is not yet in place.

Their approach to **reason** is neither autonomous philosophy nor anti‑intellectualism. Trained in **Hellenistic rhetoric and philosophy**, they freely employ terms like **ousia**, **hypostasis**, and *physis*, as **Basil** does in *Against Eunomius* to rebut simplistic Arian rationalism. Yet they insist that such terms are subordinate tools, redefined by Scripture and ecclesial usage, rather than master concepts imposed on revelation. Human **experience** is important, especially in **Gregory of Nyssa’s** mystical writings like *Life of Moses*, where spiritual progress and purification are prerequisites for deeper knowledge of God. Nonetheless, that experience is always interpreted within the canon of **Scripture** and the rule of faith. From a Reformed vantage, we can appreciate their insistence on the incomprehensibility of God and the priority of biblical revelation, yet we must be cautious where their later interpreters push their **apophatic** and experiential emphases toward an overly negative or mystical epistemology that risks eclipsing the sufficiency of the written Word.

Finally, their sense of **history and church** is crucial for their method. They read the **Arian crisis** as a providential testing of the church that calls forth clearer confession. Gregory of Nazianzus, in his *Theological Orations*, frames his arguments as contributions to the ongoing battle for the purity of the church’s teaching about **God**. They treat ecumenical councils like **Nicaea** and, later, **Constantinople**, as Spirit‑guided clarifications of what was always taught in Scripture. This aligns with the Reformed emphasis in **Calvin** and **Bavinck** on the organic development of dogma under the guidance of the Spirit, though the Cappadocians embed this more explicitly in the sacramental, episcopal structure of the Eastern **church**.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

The first and decisive locus is the **Trinity**. The confessional baseline, shared by the Reformed in documents like the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, is one simple, infinite, eternal God in three distinct persons, of one substance, power, and eternity, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The Cappadocians give the classic Eastern articulation of this reality through the distinction of one **ousia** and three **hypostaseis**. **Basil**, especially in *Against Eunomius*, argues that *ousia* names the common divine nature, while *hypostasis* refers to the individual subsistences of Father, Son, and Spirit. **Gregory of Nyssa**, in *On Not Three Gods*, wrestles with the charge of tritheism and proposes that the unity of the three is secured by their single divine **energeia**, one operation and will in all divine acts. Their immediate opponents are **Eunomius** and other Anomoean Arians, who claimed that different names imply different essences. The Cappadocians insist that distinct personal properties, such as paternity and filiation, do not entail different divine essences. Later Reformed theologians like **Turretin** will receive this Cappadocian grammar, though they criticize some Eastern formulations of the monarchy of the **Father** and insist more explicitly on divine simplicity.

A second locus is **Christology**. The catholic baseline, codified later at **Chalcedon 451**, is that Christ is one person in two natures, divine and human, without confusion, change, division, or separation. The Cappadocians are not yet speaking in Chalcedonian formulas, but they decisively contribute to them. **Gregory of Nazianzus**, in his *Letter 101* and the *Theological Orations*, insists that what is not assumed is not healed, so Christ must assume a complete human nature with rational soul, not merely a body. This is directed against **Apollinaris of Laodicea**, who taught that the divine Logos replaces the human mind in Christ. **Gregory of Nyssa**, in works like *Against Apollinaris* and *On the Soul and Resurrection*, affirms both the full deity and the complete humanity of Christ, and ties this to a recapitulation model of salvation. They stress the unity of the person of Christ, yet they do not confuse the natures. Reformed divines like **Calvin** and **Bavinck** gratefully appropriate this Cappadocian anti‑Apollinarian insight and its soteriological axiom, while pressing more clearly the forensic dimensions of Christ’s obedience and satisfaction.

A third key locus is **pneumatology**, the doctrine of the **Holy Spirit**. The catholic baseline, again later formalized but already implicit at **Nicaea** and **Constantinople**, is that the Spirit is true God, of one essence with the Father and the Son, to be worshiped and glorified together with them. **Basil’s** *On the Holy Spirit* addresses semi‑Arian opponents who hesitated to call the Spirit God and sometimes omitted him from the doxology. Basil argues from Scripture and the church’s worship that the Spirit shares the same divine rank and is to be glorified and worshiped as God. His argument that the Spirit’s sanctifying work presupposes full deity, because only God can deify, is especially important. **Gregory of Nazianzus**, in Oration 31, presses further, insisting that the Spirit is not a creature or a subordinate power but truly **Lord**. Their opponents include **Macedonius** and the so‑called Pneumatomachi. Here, Reformed theology stands side by side with the Cappadocians, affirming in the **Westminster Confession** the Spirit’s full deity, while rejecting later Eastern developments that identify the Spirit’s distinct mode of existence primarily with his energetic presence in the sacraments and mystical life, at the expense of his role in inscripturated **revelation**.

A fourth locus is the doctrine of **salvation, deification, and the Christian life**. The confessional Reformed baseline is that salvation is by **grace alone**, through faith alone, in Christ alone, and consists in justification and sanctification grounded in union with Christ, culminating in glorification and the beatific vision. The Cappadocians speak more in terms of **deification** or *theosis*, where believers, by grace, participate in the divine life. **Gregory of Nyssa’s** *Life of Moses* portrays the Christian life as an infinite ascent into God, moving from virtue to virtue, from light into the luminous darkness of divine incomprehensibility. The saved never exhaust God, but progress without end in likeness to him. **Basil**, in his ascetical rules and homilies like *Homilies on the Psalms*, connects this with monastic discipline, almsgiving, and liturgical worship as means of participation in divine life. Their interlocutors include various lax or nominal Christians as well as more radical ascetics. From a Reformed standpoint, we can affirm that union with Christ entails participation in divine life and growing likeness to God, as **Calvin’s** doctrine of union and **Bavinck’s** account of communion with the triune God make clear, yet we must qualify Cappadocian and later Eastern talk of *theosis* to preserve the Creator–creature distinction and to center salvation in Christ’s once‑for‑all accomplishment rather than in an ongoing mystical ascent.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
The Reformed tradition has generally received the **Cappadocians** as crucial allies in the formation of catholic orthodoxy, yet with important qualifications. **Calvin** follows the Nicene and Cappadocian line by speaking of one essence in three persons, stressing that while the terms may be extra‑biblical, the doctrine is derived from **Scripture**, and he cites **Basil** approvingly for distinguishing essence and hypostasis without multiplying essences. **Turretin** and later Reformed scholastics adopt the Cappadocian grammar but insist more forcefully on divine **simplicity** and the identity of God with his attributes and operations, thereby resisting any reading of Cappadocian *energeiai* that would suggest real composition in God. **Bavinck**, in *Reformed Dogmatics*, praises **Gregory of Nazianzus** for defending the incomprehensibility of God and the mystery of the Trinity, yet he is cautious toward Eastern emphases on deification when they blur the difference between Creator and creature.

Two specific points of objection for a Westminster examiner are, first, the way later Eastern Orthodox theology reads the Cappadocian distinction between **essence and energies** as implying a real distinction in God that can weaken classical simplicity, and second, the tendency to fuse **soteriology** with an essentially mystical, ascetical progression that can underplay the once‑for‑all forensic justification central to the **Reformation**. While these later developments go beyond the Cappadocians themselves, examiners will expect you to show that Reformed orthodoxy cannot simply baptize all Cappadocian and Eastern trajectories. At the same time, there are clear lessons to receive. The Reformed can learn from **Basil** and **Gregory of Nyssa** a zeal for precise, biblically grounded language in defense of the Trinity, and from **Gregory of Nazianzus** a sense that theology is doxology and must be done in the presence of God and for the worship of God. Their insistence on the **incomprehensibility of God**, the centrality of the **Spirit’s** sanctifying work, and the integration of doctrine, piety, and church life remain deeply instructive.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
For oral exams, it is safe to begin with a sentence like this: The **Cappadocian Fathers** are the key fourth century Greek theologians who gave the church the classic Nicene grammar of one *ousia* and three *hypostaseis*, defending the full deity of the Son and Spirit and shaping later Trinitarian and Christological orthodoxy. You can safely say that they clarified the **Trinity** against Arianism, contributed crucial anti‑Apollinarian insights to **Christology**, and emphasized salvation as participation in the life of the triune **God**. Phrases like one *ousia* three *hypostaseis*, what is not assumed is not healed, and the distinction between essence and operation in **God** are exam‑safe if you immediately anchor them in Scripture and the early conciliar context. It is also helpful to affirm that the Reformed tradition gladly stands with the Cappadocians at **Nicaea** and **Constantinople** in confessing the consubstantial deity of the Son and Spirit.

You must, however, avoid unqualified endorsements of later Eastern **essence–energies** doctrine by saying, for example, that the Cappadocians teach a real composition between divine essence and energies or that their theology implies that we never know God himself but only something other than God. Such language would trouble a Westminster examiner concerned for classical **simplicity** and the sufficiency of biblical **revelation**. Similarly, speak carefully about **theosis** or deification. You may say that the Cappadocians speak of believers participating in the divine life by grace, but immediately underscore that this is always participation as creatures, never an ontological merging with God, and that Reformed theology reframes this as union with Christ and communion with the triune God. Avoid giving the impression that salvation is primarily an endless mystical ascent rather than God’s definitive act in Christ applied through Word and sacrament.

Students are often confused about the relation between the **Cappadocians** and **Augustine**, which examiners may exploit. Some wrongly assume that East and West are in fundamental opposition, that the Greeks emphasize three persons at the expense of unity while Augustine sacrifices the three to the one. A more accurate position is to say that the Cappadocians and **Augustine** are complementary, both affirming one **essence** and three persons, yet with different emphases: the Cappadocians stress the **monarchy of the Father** and relational taxis, while Augustine explores psychological analogies and the unity of the divine will. Another common misunderstanding is to equate the Cappadocians directly with later **Palamism**, as if they already taught a formalized essence–energies distinction in the fourteenth century sense. Examiners will appreciate if you distinguish the historical Cappadocians from later Eastern receptions, noting both lines of continuity and significant development. Throughout, keep bringing them back under the authority of **Scripture**, show awareness of Reformed retrieval in **Bavinck** and **Turretin**, and avoid exaggerated East–West polarities that ignore the common Nicene heritage.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, the **Cappadocian Fathers** are to be honored as indispensable architects of Nicene **Trinitarian** and early **Christological** orthodoxy, whose one *ousia* three *hypostaseis* grammar, affirmation of the full deity of the Son and Spirit, and anti‑Apollinarian insistence on Christ’s complete humanity stand as permanent gains for the catholic church, yet their essence–operations pattern, deification language, and later Eastern reception must be carefully subordinated to the sufficiency and clarity of Scripture, the non‑negotiable affirmation of divine **simplicity**, and the Reformational focus on justification by faith alone, so when asked where we land, we should say that Reformed orthodoxy gladly receives the Cappadocian core as our own while rejecting any developments that compromise the Creator–creature distinction, obscure the gospel of free grace in Christ, or elevate mystical ascent and ecclesial experience above the written Word of the triune God.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- The **Cappadocian Fathers** are the fourth century Greek bishops Basil, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of Nyssa who secured Nicene Trinitarian orthodoxy by clarifying one *ousia* and three *hypostaseis*.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- **Basil of Caesarea** (c. 330–379) wrote *Against Eunomius* and *On the Holy Spirit* (c. 375) while serving as bishop in Cappadocia against **Arianism**.
- **Gregory of Nazianzus** (c. 329–390) preached the *Theological Orations* around 380 in **Constantinople**, defending the **Trinity** and the full deity of the Spirit.
- **Gregory of Nyssa** (c. 335–c. 395) wrote *Against Eunomius*, *On Not Three Gods*, and *Life of Moses* in the 370s–380s, synthesizing **Trinity** and **deification**.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- The Cappadocians ground theology in **Scripture** read within the church’s creed and liturgy, using philosophical terms like **ousia** and **hypostasis** as subordinate tools.
- They emphasize **apophatic theology**, insisting that the divine **essence** is incomprehensible while God is truly known in his works and saving **energeiai**.
- They link knowledge of **God** to ascetical and sacramental life, so theological understanding grows with holiness and participation in **grace**.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- On the **Trinity**, they define one **ousia** and three **hypostaseis**, securing unity of essence and distinction of persons against **Eunomian** Arianism.
- On **Christology**, they insist with **Gregory of Nazianzus** that what is not assumed is not healed, thus Christ must have a full human nature against **Apollinaris**.
- On **pneumatology**, **Basil’s** *On the Holy Spirit* argues that the Spirit is fully God, worthy of the same worship and glory as the Father and the Son.
- On **salvation**, especially in **Gregory of Nyssa**, they frame redemption as *theosis*, an unending ascent into God by grace, while preserving the Creator–creature distinction in principle.
- On **revelation and language**, they stress that theological terms are analogical and doxological, defending the mystery and **incomprehensibility of God**.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press whether Cappadocian essence–operations patterns, later developed as **essence–energies**, are compatible with classical divine **simplicity**.
- They will question whether Cappadocian **theosis** and mystical ascent obscure the Reformational focus on justification by faith alone and the finality of Christ’s work.
- They may challenge any suggestion that Cappadocian **apophaticism** undermines the clarity and sufficiency of **Scripture** for knowledge of God.
- They will want clarity that Reformed orthodoxy embraces Cappadocian **Trinitarian** and **Christological** formulations but not all later Eastern Orthodox elaborations.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Cappadocians vs Augustine** on the Trinity contrasts Eastern relational taxis and the monarchy of the Father with **Augustine’s** psychological analogy and emphasis on unity of will.
- **Cappadocians vs Aquinas and Reformed scholastics** on **simplicity** and divine **operations** highlights different ways of handling God’s one act ad extra.
- **Cappadocians vs Calvin** on **theosis and union** compares Eastern deification language with **Calvin’s** doctrine of union with Christ and communion with the triune God.
- **Cappadocians vs Palamas** on **essence–energies** distinguishes the fourth century fathers’ more fluid usage from fourteenth century **Palamite** formalization.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- The **Cappadocian Fathers** are indispensable allies for Reformed Trinitarian and Christological orthodoxy, but their deification‑mystical trajectories and essence–energies language must be carefully subordinated to Scripture, divine simplicity, and the gospel of free grace in Christ.
