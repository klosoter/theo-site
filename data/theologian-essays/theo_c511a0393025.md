### ESSAY
C. H. Dodd, born in 1884 and deceased in 1973, emerged as a leading architect of **Modern Liberal Theology** in Britain whose work set the agenda for New Testament theology for two generations. Raised within **Congregationalism** and trained at Oxford and Mansfield College, he absorbed the historical sensibilities of **Adolf von Harnack** and the ethical concentration of liberal Protestantism. His appointments at Manchester from 1930 to 1935 and at Cambridge as **Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity** from 1935 to 1949 positioned him at the center of British academic theology. After 1950 he directed the **New English Bible** translation, where his exegetical judgments shaped anglophone Bible reading. Across these roles Dodd advanced a unifying thesis: the New Testament articulates a **kerygma** whose core is the realized presence of the **Kingdom of God**, a theological claim anchored in history but purified of apocalyptic excess.

Dodd’s self-conscious method was **historical-critical** in mode and **form-critical** in tools, yet always oriented to proclamation rather than mere source dissection. He appropriated the *Sitz im Leben* categories of **Gunkel** and **Dibelius**, though he wore German scholarship lightly, subordinating classification to theological synthesis. In **The Authority of the Bible (1928)** he offered a programmatic account of Scripture as the canonical deposit of Israel’s and the Church’s encounter with God. For Dodd, biblical authority is not inerrant decree but the norming witness of a unique historical movement, the emergence of the **gospel**. Inspiration is the Spirit’s vitality in the believing community, not a mechanical origination of every textual detail. This stance permitted him to desacralize textual phenomena while heightening the binding force of the **kerygma** that the texts bear. His disciplined engagement with Greek semantics, such as the careful treatment of terms like **logos**, *hilasterion*, and *basileia*, typified a method that combined philology with theological judgment.

The first decisive doctrinal move appears in **The Parables of the Kingdom (1935)**, where Dodd advanced **realized eschatology** as a comprehensive reinterpretation of Jesus’ message. Against **Albert Schweitzer’s** consistent eschatology, which read Jesus as an apocalyptic prophet expecting an imminent cosmic crisis, Dodd argued that Jesus proclaimed that the **Kingdom of God** had already came to actuality in his ministry. The parables are not coded time-tables but events of crisis that precipitate decision, the moral and spiritual encounter with God in the present. Thus the mustard seed and leaven are not symbols of gradual future growth but signals that God’s royal rule is operative now. Dodd made this case through redactional and form-critical analysis, re-situating sayings in what he judged to be their original *Sitz im Leben* in the earliest preaching. The result was a coherent picture of Jesus as the bearer of a realized divine sovereignty, reshaping how **eschatology** functions in Christian dogmatics.

The programmatic sequel, **The Apostolic Preaching and Its Developments (1936)**, sought to recover the earliest **kerygma** from the speeches in **Acts** and pre-Pauline traditions. Dodd distilled a recurring pattern: the age of fulfillment has dawned; the **Scriptures** have been fulfilled; Jesus’ life, death, and resurrection constitute the decisive saving events; he has been exalted as Lord; he will judge and bring consummation; therefore repentance and faith are demanded. Though not denying future dimensions, Dodd asserted the overwhelming accent on present fulfillment. He compared this pattern with **Rudolf Bultmann’s** existential demythologizing and found a point of convergence in focusing on proclamation rather than speculative metaphysics, yet Dodd retained more confidence than Bultmann in the historical rootedness of the messages. He also anticipated **Heilsgeschichte** approaches by showing how Israel’s story culminates in Christ, but he insisted the eschaton is already operative, relocating the weight of Christian hope from futurist expectation to present participation.

Dodd’s exegesis of **Paul** extended the same trajectory. In his **Moffatt Commentary** on **The Epistle of Paul to the Romans (1932)** he argued that Paul’s vocabulary of wrath and atoning sacrifice is fundamentally ethical-personal rather than cultic-propitiatory. Dodd’s famous treatment of *hilasterion* in Romans 3:25 contended for **expiation not propitiation**, reading the term as the removal of sin rather than the turning aside of divine wrath. Correspondingly, the **wrath of God** in Romans 1 is not an affective divine anger but the moral order by which sin carries its own judgment as a process. This moral-theological reading elevated the love and holiness of God while avoiding mythic appeasement categories. When Dodd later chaired the **New English Bible** project, this interpretation influenced translation decisions, shaping ecclesial understanding of **atonement** across the English-speaking world. Evangelical and Reformed critics such as **Leon Morris** and **John Murray** responded vigorously, Morris in particular in The Apostolic Preaching of the Cross arguing that Dodd’s lexical decisions flattened the cultic-sacrificial field and ignored the personal dimension of **divine wrath** and **propitiation** found in the Septuagint and intertestamental literature.

A third axis of Dodd’s contribution lies in **Johannine** studies. His **Johannine Epistles (1946)** introduced the semantic and theological patterns that would flourish in **The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel (1953)**, an epochal monograph. There he read **John** through the lens of symbolic realism: **Logos**, light and darkness, life and judgment function as theological symbols disclosing a reality that believers enter here and now. Again the theme of **realized eschatology** dominates. Eternal life is not a post-mortem acquisition but the present possession of those who believe. At the same time, in **Historical Tradition in the Fourth Gospel (1963)**, Dodd mounted a carefully argued case that beneath the discourses and signs lies genuine historical memory of Jesus’ ministry in Judea and Jerusalem. This was a direct rejoinder to **Bultmann’s** reconstruction of a Gnostic Redeemer myth and the radical disjunction between history and theology. Dodd maintained that theological interpretation does not sever ties to events; rather, symbol and history are integrated in the Fourth Gospel’s testimony to Christ.

In **History and the Gospel (1938)** Dodd further refined his view of the nexus between faith and historical knowledge. He rejected both positivist historicism that demands neutral facts and existentialist retreat that dissolves history into decision. The **gospel** for Dodd is a proclamation rooted in historical occurrences that are themselves theophanic disclosures. Thus the task of theology is neither to abandon history nor to deify it, but to trace how proclamation interprets event. The mature synthesis in **The Founder of Christianity (1970)** presents Jesus as the living center of a movement whose faith and memory carry forward his impact. There is a gentle but clear opposition to theories that posit a sharp break between Jesus and the Church; Dodd’s ecclesiological instinct, consistent with **kerygma**-oriented theology, sees continuity through witness and worship. Here his long directorship of the **New English Bible** project surfaces in a practical theology of translation: rendering Scripture in contemporary idiom so that the original **kerygma** might once again address the hearer.

Dodd’s intellectual interlocutors sharpened his positions. He defined himself over against **Albert Schweitzer**’s eschatological radicalism by showing the density of present-tense **Kingdom** language in synoptic tradition. He engaged **Rudolf Bultmann** both appreciatively, in centering proclamation and distinguishing faith from objective metaphysics, and critically, by rejecting the severance of **myth** from event and insisting on historical continuity. With **Joachim Jeremias**, he debated the economic balance of futurity and presence in Jesus’ teaching; Jeremias pressed the Aramaic substratum and Jewish apocalyptic background to reapply future expectancy, adjusting Dodd’s weighting while preserving the realized core. **Oscar Cullmann’s** **Heilsgeschichte** sharpened Dodd’s sense of the unfolding of redemption, although Dodd retained a more presentist emphasis. On the British scene, colleagues such as **C. K. Barrett** and **J. A. T. Robinson** shared Dodd’s desire to reconcile rigorous criticism with theological affirmation, even where they diverged on specifics. Later evangelical responses, notably **Leon Morris** on the cross and **George Eldon Ladd** on the **already and not yet**, registered substantive corrections that nonetheless acknowledged Dodd’s constructive provocations.

Dodd’s legacy is also hermeneutical and linguistic. His attention to the semantic texture of New Testament language encouraged subsequent work in lexicography and discourse analysis, even when particular conclusions, such as the limitation of *hilasterion* to **expiation**, were revised by later studies. His insistence that election motifs, covenant language, and **Scripture** fulfillment claims in the **kerygma** be taken seriously helped spark the mid-century **biblical theology movement** in English. He also modeled a public-facing scholarly vocation through the **New English Bible**, persuading churches that translation is itself a theological act governed by judgments about God, grace, and **history**. The combination of elegant prose, patient historical reconstruction, and doctrinal ambition made Dodd a benchmark for academic pastors and pastoral academics alike.

From the vantage of classical Reformed theology, a balanced evaluation highlights both gifts and gaps. Dodd’s emphasis on the present **Kingdom** and the unified **kerygma** offers salutary correction to speculative dogmatics; his insistence that theology be tethered to **Scripture** and the apostolic proclamation resonates with a **covenantal** and redemptive-historical instinct. Yet significant tensions emerge with **Westminster Theology** at three points. First, on revelation and Scripture, Dodd’s notion of the Bible as fallible witness undercuts **Scripture as special revelation** and the plenary authority assumed in Reformed **inspiration** and **inerrancy**. Second, on atonement, the shift to **expiation not propitiation** marginalizes the personal **wrath of God** and the necessity of **penal substitution** taught in confessional Reformed soteriology, where God’s justice and love meet at the cross. Third, on eschatology, Dodd’s heavy stress on **realized eschatology** obscures the robust futurity of the **already and not yet**, a biblical tension that guards Christian hope and ethics. A Reformed alternative keeps Dodd’s insight that the eschaton has intruded in Christ while preserving future consummation, retains the apostolic **kerygma** but anchors it in covenantal promise and fulfillment, and reads Romans 3 with both **propitiation** and **expiation** integrated under God’s holy love. In sum, Dodd remains a necessary conversation partner whose constructive center illumines and whose liberal reductions sharpen the contours of classical Reformed commitments.
