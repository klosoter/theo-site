### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation and world
J. Gresham Machen, born in Baltimore in 1881 and deceased in 1937, came of age between the **Gilded Age confidence** and the **interwar crisis**, bridging the world of **Old Princeton** and the birth of **Westminster Theological Seminary**. Trained in the classical tradition at **Johns Hopkins** under **Basil L. Gildersleeve**, he entered **Princeton Seminary** in 1902 where **B. B. Warfield** and **Geerhardus Vos** yoked **Reformed confessionalism** to a rigorous **scientific theology** that treated **Scripture** as a source of **propositional revelation**. In 1905 to 1906 Machen studied in Germany, engaging **Wilhelm Herrmann** at Marburg and observing **Ritschlian** currents that reduced **Christianity** to ethical value and **religious experience**. The encounter intensified his conviction that the **Gospel’s supernatural history** stands over against **modern naturalism**, while confirming the need for precise **historical method** in defense of **incarnation** and **resurrection**.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Machen’s method was a distinctive fusion of **Old Princeton evidential realism** with **Reformed confessional orthodoxy**. Following **Warfield** on **plenary inspiration and inerrancy**, he argued that **Christian truth** consists of **facts and doctrines** revealed by God, articulated in clear **propositions**, and testable in the arena of **public history**. Against the subjectivism of **liberal Protestantism**, he maintained the unity of **fact and value** in the biblical drama of **creation, fall, redemption, consummation**. There is a marked antithesis between **supernaturalism and naturalism**, yet he appropriated the tools of **philology**, **history**, and **textual criticism** to argue that **miracle** and **revelation** are not violations of reason but events in God’s ordered world. With **Vos**, he received a **redemptive-historical** sensibility, though his apologetic voice often reflected **Princeton induction** more than later **presuppositional** formulations. The epistemic center remained **Christ’s once-for-all work**, confessed in the **Westminster Standards**, and verified in **apostolic witness**.

#### 3. War and disillusionment
Machen’s service with the **YMCA** in France during 1918 to 1919 exposed the ravages of **total war**, undercutting the idyll of **progressive optimism** characteristic of **American pragmatism** and **liberal Protestantism**. The experience sharpened his doctrine of **sin** and the necessity of **grace**, intensifying his polemic for **supernatural redemption** against the moral uplift of **social gospel** activism. Out of this crucible emerged the insistence that the **Church** is not a vehicle of cultural progress but a **supernatural society** constituted by **Word and sacrament**, bound to **Christ’s atonement** and the **Spirit’s regenerating power**.

#### 4. Christianity and Liberalism 1923
The pivot of Machen’s public legacy is **Christianity and Liberalism** 1923, a sustained argument that **Protestant liberalism** is not a variant of the **Christian religion** but another religion altogether. He framed the controversy under the antithesis **supernaturalism versus naturalism**, then pursued six loci where the divergence is decisive. In the locus of **doctrine**, Christianity offers a revealed **system of truth**, while liberalism substitutes **experience** and **ethical ideals**. In the locus of **God and man**, Christianity asserts **transcendence**, **holiness**, and **human sin**, while liberalism advances **immanence** and **moralism**. In the locus of **Scripture**, Christianity confesses **plenary inspiration and inerrancy**, while liberalism reduces the **Bible** to a record of religious aspiration. In the locus of **Christ**, Christianity confesses **incarnation** with **virgin birth** and **miracles**, while liberalism applauds **Jesus as exemplar**. In the locus of **salvation**, Christianity teaches **substitutionary atonement**, **imputation**, and **justification by faith alone**, while liberalism preaches **character formation**. In the locus of **the Church**, Christianity binds believers to a **confessional and disciplined communion**, while liberalism seeks a **broad coalition** of religious sentiment. The book’s thesis crystallized a generation of Reformed resistance to **Auburn Affirmation** minimalism and energized the founding of **Westminster Seminary** in 1929.

#### 5. Historical apologetics and Pauline theology
Earlier, in **The Origin of Paul’s Religion** 1921, Machen engaged the **religionsgeschichtliche Schule**, contesting the claim that **Pauline Christianity** arose from **Hellenistic mystery cults** or late **gnosis**. He argued from **apostolic testimony**, **Jewish monotheism**, and the continuity of **Old Testament promise** that **Paul’s gospel** flows from the **resurrection appearances** and **Damascus road revelation**, not from syncretistic borrowing. The central doctrines of **substitutionary atonement**, **union with Christ**, and **justification** are grounded in **Christ’s historical death and resurrection**, interpreted by **apostolic authority**. Machen insisted that **Jesus and Paul** are not opposed but organically related by **covenantal fulfillment**, thereby resisting the liberal fragmentation of **kerygma** into disparate religious projects. His historical apologetic thus defended both the **credibility of miracle** and the **coherence of doctrine**, tying **Reformed soteriology** directly to the **apostolic deposit**.

#### 6. Christology, Scripture, and faith
Machen extended this line in **What Is Faith?** 1925 and **The Virgin Birth of Christ** 1930. In **What Is Faith?** he argued that saving **faith** is not bare **fiducia** detached from knowledge but a complex act embracing **notitia**, **assensus**, and **fiducia**, unified by the objective **Christus pro nobis**. Faith rests on the **kerygma** of **Christ’s person and work**, not on autonomous **religious experience**, so the Church must preach **doctrine**. In **The Virgin Birth of Christ**, he mounted a robust defense of **two-natures Christology** and the **incarnation** as historical, exegeting **Matthew** and **Luke**, weighing **textual variants**, and addressing alleged parallels in **pagan mythology**. The work couples **historical criticism** with **confessional conviction**, contending that **virgin birth** belongs to the fabric of **Scripture’s unity** and the **gospel’s coherence**. By upholding the **resurrection** and **miracle** as public acts, Machen aimed to secure the **objectivity of revelation**, guarding **plenary inspiration** and **inerrancy** as the proper ground for **faith**.

#### 7. Language, exegesis, and the scholarly habitus
Machen’s scholarly habitus is evident in **New Testament Greek for Beginners** 1923, a tool that formed generations in the grammar of **Koine Greek**. The grammar embodied **Old Princeton** commitments to **philology**, **text**, and **exegesis**, reinforcing a ministerial culture where **biblical languages** are instruments of **doctrinal precision**. Likewise, in the posthumous **The Christian View of Man** 1937, he articulated an **anthropology** loyal to **creation order**, **image of God**, **original sin**, and **federal headship**, resisting both **evolutionary naturalism** and **romantic idealism**. Across these labors, Machen’s core claim remained that **doctrine and history** are inseparable, that **theology** is a disciplined knowledge, and that **Reformed orthodoxy** possesses the intellectual resources to meet **modern criticism** without surrendering **supernaturalism**.

#### 8. Church, missions, and the American state
Ecclesiastically, Machen fought the conflation of **broad church polity** with **doctrinal indifferentism**. The **Auburn Affirmation** of 1924, which relativized the **virgin birth**, **atonement**, **resurrection**, **miracles**, and **Scripture**, was for him a line in the sand. In 1933 he helped organize the **Independent Board for Presbyterian Foreign Missions**, protesting the tolerance of **modernism** in the **Presbyterian Board**. His subsequent trial for **insubordination**, suspension in 1935 to 1936, and role in founding the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** in 1936, revealed his conviction that **confessional subscription** and **discipline** are marks of a **true church**. In **Education, Christianity, and the State** 1933, Machen argued for **liberty of conscience**, a limited role for the **state** in education, and the cultural importance of **liberal learning**. Though articulating a recognizable **libertarian** impulse, he located freedom within a **Christian anthropology** that honors **imago Dei** and the independence of **church and family** under **God’s sovereignty**.

#### 9. Christianity and culture
Machen’s early essay **Christianity and Culture** 1912 framed his stance toward the **modern world**. Rejecting both **cultural withdrawal** and **uncritical accommodation**, he advanced a project of **Christian scholarship** grounded in **general revelation** and guided by **special revelation**. The Church must build a serious intellectual life, cultivating **arts and sciences** under the lordship of **Christ**, while recognizing the deep **antithesis** posed by **modern naturalism**. His posture diverged from populist **fundamentalism** by defending **classical education**, by embracing **philological rigor**, and by resisting **anti-intellectualism**. Yet his solidarity with the **fundamentalist coalition** on **virgin birth**, **atonement**, and **resurrection** arose from his deeper allegiance to **Reformed confessionalism** rather than to a movement. Here Machen stands as a conservative modern, using the **university’s tools** to rebut the **university’s unbelief**.

#### 10. Late years and death
The reorganization of **Princeton Seminary** in 1929 under denominational control catalyzed Machen’s departure and the founding of **Westminster Theological Seminary** in Philadelphia, where he taught **New Testament** and helped shape a faculty that included **Cornelius Van Til**, **Ned Stonehouse**, and **John Murray**. These years concentrated his energies on building a **confessional seminary**, defending **missions**, and articulating a public philosophy of **liberty** grounded in **Christian truth**. In late 1936 Machen traveled on behalf of the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** and succumbed to pneumonia on January 1, 1937, in **Bismarck, North Dakota**. His last telegram reportedly rejoiced in the **active obedience of Christ**, a fitting summary of a life spent defending **justification by faith alone** and the full **gospel of grace**.

#### 11. Doctrinal profile and internal coherence
Across his corpus, Machen’s doctrinal profile is marked by **incarnation**, **substitutionary atonement**, **resurrection**, **justification by faith alone**, **Scripture’s authority**, and **churchly discipline**. He argued that **Christianity** is irreducibly **supernatural**, anchored in events that occurred in space and time, interpreted by **apostolic witness**, and confessed in **creedal form**. His consistent theme was the inseparability of **doctrine and history**. The **virgin birth** safeguards **Christ’s person**, the **atonement** resolves the problem of **sin under divine justice**, the **resurrection** vindicates **Christ’s messiahship**, and **Scripture** binds **Church and conscience**. This orchestration yields an integrated **Reformed catholicity** that both receives the **Westminster Standards** and contends for their public rationality. Machen’s articulation thereby stood as a confessional answer to **Harnack’s essence of Christianity**, to **Herrmann’s experience-centered faith**, and to **Fosdick’s modernist sermonizing**.

#### 12. Reformed and Westminster evaluation
A Westminster and broader **Reformed** evaluation sees in Machen a towering ally for **confessional orthodoxy**, yet also a set of tensions. His use of **Old Princeton induction** and appeals to **common facts** risked conceding too much to a putatively neutral **reason**, a move later challenged by **Van Til’s** emphasis on **covenantal epistemology** and the **self-authenticating Scripture** as principium. Machen’s antithesis of **supernaturalism versus naturalism** rightly names the crisis, yet a fuller **Trinitarian theology of revelation** could foreground the **triune Lord’s** covenantal claim on all **knowing** and all **culture**, beyond evidences to **presuppositions**. His plea for **liberty of conscience** and minimal **statism** resonates with **Reformed sphere sovereignty** and **liberty under law**, though such political judgments exceed confessional necessity and may be variously cashed out within **natural law** and **common grace** frameworks. Positively, Machen’s defense of **incarnation**, **atonement**, **resurrection**, and **inerrancy**, his insistence on **church discipline** and **missions**, and his building of **Westminster Seminary** embody classical **Reformed catholicity**. Where method needs recalibration, a Westminster alternative deepens his own aims by rooting apologetics and culture-making in **covenant revelation**, **Calvin’s duplex cognitio Dei**, and **Bavinck’s organic worldview**, preserving Machen’s **doctrinal core** while strengthening the philosophical ground of **Christian certainty**.
