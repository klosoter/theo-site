### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Hans Madueme emerges within the late modern evangelical world where **theology–science** questions about **evolution** and the **historicity of Adam** have become fault lines for doctrine and ecclesial identity. Trained both in the empirical disciplines and in systematic theology, his intellectual posture is defined by a robust **Augustinian realism** about sin and a confessional **sola Scriptura** stance guided by the **regula fidei** or rule of faith. The ambient intellectual setting is shaped by **scientific naturalism**, the diffusion of **evolutionary anthropology**, and the internal evangelical conversations catalyzed by organizations like **BioLogos** on the one hand and confessional institutions tied to **Reformed orthodoxy** on the other. Against this backdrop, Madueme’s method is intentionally ecclesial: Scripture read canonically within the **great tradition**, theological judgments made by **dogmatic location** rather than by atomized exegesis, and a presumption that the **noetic effects of sin** deform not only moral reasoning but also our scientific theorizing about human origins.

This **dogmatic-ecclesial method** produces a principled asymmetry: while empirical findings can prompt hermeneutical attentiveness, the controlling norm remains **Scripture** as confessed in **catholic and Reformed orthodoxy**. Theologically freighted anthropological claims such as **federal headship** or **original sin** must therefore not be surrendered to scientific reconstructions whose metaphysical commitments often exceed their evidential warrants. In Madueme’s hands, **Augustine** is not a museum piece but a living authority whose construal of **peccatum originale** offers categories resilient enough to withstand modern biology. He consistently presses the evangelical temptation to instrumentalize tradition and urges a chastened **theological interpretation of Scripture**, deploying the classic distinction between *ad intra* divine simplicity and *ad extra* providence in ways that sustain doctrinal coherence across loci.

#### 2. Major works and thematic concentration
Madueme’s most visible scholarly node is the edited collection **Adam, the Fall, and Original Sin** with **Michael Reeves** in 2014, a volume that assembles biblical, historical, and scientific essays to defend a **historical Adam** and the doctrinal integrity of **original sin**. His contributions there, and in subsequent articles, sharpen a thesis: that the doctrine of **original sin** is both a linchpin in the system of doctrine and particularly vulnerable to the pressures of **evolutionary anthropology**. In **Themelios** during 2013–2015 he authored essays clarifying the dogmatic stakes of **Adam** and the **Fall**, arguing that Romans 5 and 1 Corinthians 15 tether Christian soteriology to a real **adamic headship**. In 2019 at **Sapientia** he engaged the burgeoning **Genealogical Adam and Eve** proposal associated with **S. Joshua Swamidass**, welcoming clarification of population genetics while insisting that dogmatics, not genetics, governs what counts as theologically sufficient **historicity**.

Across these writings the throughline is a constructive **hamartiology**. He treats **original sin** in its classic twofold aspect, **guilt** and **corruption**, anchored in **federal representation** and divine covenant. He highlights the organic links between **original sin**, **atonement** and **Christology**, so that any revision to Adam reverberates through the doctrines of **incarnation**, **imputation**, and the **resurrection** of Christ as the **second Adam**. His argument is not antiquarian. It is a dogmatic claim that the texture of biblical proclamation and ecclesial confession forms a web of beliefs in which **historical Adam** functions as a structural joint. Severing that joint for the sake of **theistic evolution** effects a cascading collapse across loci, what he elsewhere calls the dissolving pressure on the most vulnerable part of the tradition.

#### 3. Adam, original sin, and the science question
Madueme’s core insistence is that the **historical Adam** is not an optional appendix but a doctrinal necessity grounded in **Romans 5.12–21** and **1 Corinthians 15.21–22, 45–49**, where **federal headship** and corporate solidarity are not dispensable metaphors. He presses **John H. Walton** and **Peter Enns** on their proposals that refigure **Adam** as archetype or mythic Israel, showing how such moves disturb the **covenant of works**, weaken the logic of **imputation**, and attenuate **penal substitution**. In critique of **Denis Alexander’s** Homo divinus model and related **BioLogos** positions, he argues that adoptionist or population-based accounts of human origins fail to secure the biblical grammar of a primal transgression and the universality of **peccatum originale**. Even when acknowledging the limits of biblical genealogies and ancient Near Eastern context, he contends that a dogmatics of **creation and fall** cannot be reconstructed from evolutionary history without losing the **ordo salutis** that depends on Christ as the **second Adam**.

The engagement with **S. Joshua Swamidass** on **Genealogical Adam and Eve** is instructive. Madueme appreciates the clarification that a de novo Adam and Eve could be genealogical ancestors of all living humans by the first millennium, a finding consistent with standard population genetics. Yet he judges that such a model is theologically underdetermined if it does not also secure **federal headship**, the **immediate creation** of Adam from the dust, and the transmission of **original guilt**. The dogmatic point is that a merely genealogical solution risks being a technical fix. By contrast, the church’s confessional synthesis positions **Adam** at the intersection of **anthropology**, **hamartiology**, and **soteriology**, and that triangulation cannot be reduced to a population genetics diagram.

#### 4. Natural evil, demonic agency, and the cosmic fall
One of Madueme’s distinctive contributions is a retrieval of **demonology** in accounting for **natural evil** within a creation that many Christians believe includes pre-Adamic animal death and suffering. He reframes the problem not as a concession to **theodicy** but as a biblical retrieval of **cosmic fall** motifs in **Job**, the **Gospels**, and **Romans 8**, where created order groans under hostile **powers and principalities**. He distances his account from open theist or warfare theologies such as in **Gregory Boyd**, while maintaining **classical theism** with **divine providence** and **primary–secondary causality**. The thesis is that **Satanic agency** and fallen angelic powers may function as secondary causes of predation and disease, enabling Christians to confess both an originally good creation and the tragic disarray of nature without implicating God as the author of evil.

This retrieval is bound to his **privatio boni** understanding of evil, inherited from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, yet he insists that privation can be historically located in creaturely acts that introduce disorder. By embedding **natural evil** within a **biblical demonology**, Madueme aims to reduce the pressure to revise **original sin** in light of evolutionary accounts of animal suffering. The broader dogmatic lesson is consistent: locate scientific descriptions within a thicker **metaphysical and biblical** frame, rather than reconfiguring doctrines to fit a reductive **naturalism**.

#### 5. Scripture, tradition, and the asymmetry with science
Methodologically, Madueme is a champion of **confessional exegesis**, the reading of **Scripture** within the **rule of faith** and the **Reformed confessions**, not as a constraint but as the church’s accumulated wisdom. He frequently invokes the **noetic effects of sin** to caution against the presumption that the sciences deliver neutral descriptions of reality. In conversation with **Alvin Plantinga**, he contends that **methodological naturalism** often smuggles **metaphysical naturalism** into interpretive frames, yielding a hermeneutical circle that begs the theological question. This is not an anti-science posture. It is a disciplined insistence on what he terms an asymmetry: **the Bible** norms science on questions that are dogmatically located, whereas science can prompt exegetical reexamination only within the boundaries of the **regula fidei**.

Because of this asymmetry, Madueme resists harmonization strategies that lead to **Procrustean hermeneutics**, for instance, reducing **Genesis** to near silence about **Adam** or unmooring **Pauline hamartiology** from history. He prefers a modest **concord** in which empirical findings about hominin antiquity or population dynamics are sifted through **theological interpretation**, granting provisional status to scientific claims that trespass into doctrinal domains. This posture, characteristic of classic **magisterial Protestantism**, refuses a bifurcation of truth while denying the sciences a magisterial seat at the doctrinal table.

#### 6. Soteriology and the integrative stakes
For Madueme, **original sin** is never a standalone topic. It is the necessary precondition for robust **atonement theology** and for the confession of **Christ** as **second Adam**. He argues that **penal substitution**, **union with Christ**, and **imputed righteousness** all stand or fall with a non-symbolic **Adam** whose trespass incurs **forensic guilt** and introduces **corruption**. He retrieves **Calvin’s** and **Reformed scholastic** accounts of **federal headship** as the rationality that binds the many to the one in both condemnation and justification. This soteriological integration is evident in his insistence that alternatives to **historical Adam** generate doctrinal slippage: sin becomes pathology rather than transgression, death loses its penal accent, and the cross risks becoming exemplary rather than propitiatory.

He also parses **anthropology** through this lens. The human person, on his account, is not reducible to biology or population history but is a **covenantal** agent whose identity and destiny are structured by divine communion and fall. Here Madueme aligns with **Augustine’s** reading of the will and **Aquinas’s** account of nature and grace, while maintaining a distinctly **Reformed** accent on **total depravity** and the necessity of **regeneration**. The integrated vision resists compartmentalization: change **Adam**, and one necessarily changes **Christ** and **salvation**.

#### 7. Interlocutors and polemical edge
Much of Madueme’s writing is dialogical, engaging figures like **Peter Enns**, **John H. Walton**, **Denis Alexander**, and **Scot McKnight**, as well as institutional projects like **BioLogos**. He commends their desire to reconcile **science** and **faith** but contends that their proposals often operate with thin **metaphysics** and attenuated **ecclesial authority**. His critiques are not merely exegetical; they are **dogmatic**. He argues, for example, that dislocating **Adam** from history performs unacknowledged surgery on the **Apostles Creed** and **Nicene** patterns, where creation and redemption form a single economy. Likewise, in response to the **Genealogical Adam and Eve** model, he presses for doctrinal specificity: Are we securing **federal guilt** and **de novo creation**, or are we merely accommodating genetics with an under-defined theological placeholder?

At the same time, Madueme is constructive and irenic in tone. He encourages evangelical theologians to retrieve **patristic** and **medieval** resources, not least **Augustinian hamartiology** and **Aquinas’s** account of **providence**, to think beyond the modern impasses. He finds help in **Plantinga’s** analysis of the **evolutionary argument against naturalism**, using it to frame the epistemic limits of secular accounts of origins, while insisting that the church’s **confessional** testimony remains the decisive theater for doctrinal adjudication.

#### 8. Pedagogy, editorial work, and influence
Beyond monographs and chapters, Madueme’s influence is mediated through pedagogy and editorial service. As a teacher in a confessional liberal arts setting, he integrates **systematic theology** with the **natural sciences**, inviting students to hold together **dogmatics**, **exegesis**, and **scientific literacy**. His editorial roles at venues like **Themelios** and **Sapientia** have positioned him as a curator of the contemporary evangelical conversation on **Adam**, **original sin**, and **creation**. Through these platforms he has amplified voices committed to **classical orthodoxy** while modeling fair engagement with dissenting proposals.

The cumulative effect is a public theologian whose niche is the dogmatic heart of the **theology–science** debate. Rather than mapping yet another compromise between **evolution** and **Genesis**, he interrogates the doctrinal costs and insists that evangelicalism cannot afford to lose **original sin** and **historical Adam** without losing the gospel’s grammar. His constructive retrieval of **demonology** in theodicy discussions and his consistent focus on **federal theology** mark him as a distinctive voice among contemporary evangelicals.

#### 9. Assessment and development
Madueme’s project is a sustained bid for **dogmatic integrity** in an age prone to disciplinary fragmentation. He reads **Scripture** with the church, confident that **Augustinian** and **Reformed** categories retain explanatory power even under modern scientific scrutiny. His focus on **hamartiology** is strategic, since pressure on **original sin** often functions as the wedge for broader doctrinal revision. By securing **Adam**, he seeks to secure **Christ**. His selective retrieval of **demonology** in accounts of **natural evil** complements this aim by absorbing evolutionary data about animal suffering without capitulating to **naturalism**.

Critics may question whether his use of **demonic agency** stretches beyond the evidence of Scripture or risks marginalizing **secondary causality** under **divine providence**. Others may worry that the insistence on **de novo** creation of Adam unduly constrains readings of **Genesis 2** that could be reconciled with aspects of **evolutionary biology**. Yet Madueme’s insistence on the **asymmetry** between Scripture and science, his thick **ecclesial** instincts, and his careful attention to **dogmatic location** provide a coherent framework within which such tensions can be explored without premature doctrinal surrender.

Finally, a Reformed and WTS evaluation: Madueme’s stance coheres with **classical Reformed orthodoxy** on **covenant**, **federal headship**, and the **noetic antithesis** associated with **Van Til**. His Scripture-first asymmetry, emphasis on **confessional boundaries**, and defense of **original sin** will resonate strongly at Westminster. Potential tensions arise in his deployment of **demonic causality** for **natural evil**, which must be squared with Reformed accounts of **meticulous providence**, **concursus**, and **theodicy** grounded in **divine simplicity** and **immutability**. A WTS-friendly alternative would stress **covenantal protology** and **eschatology** to account for creation’s groaning under **curse**, while maintaining creaturely secondary causes under God’s comprehensive decree, thus preserving Madueme’s concerns about **naturalism** and **historical Adam** without speculative overreach. Even so, his central thesis stands: in matters of **revelation**, **covenant**, and **grace**, Christian anthropology must be normed by the **canonical narrative** and **confessional** wisdom, not by shifting scientific metanarratives.
