### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the shape of a method
Steven J. Duby emerges as a leading voice in the contemporary evangelical retrieval of **classical theism**, situated within a landscape marked by post-Barthian wariness of **natural theology** and the rise of **analytic philosophy of religion**. His work is framed by the conviction that **Scripture** is the principium cognoscendi of theology while metaphysics serves as ancilla, a ministerial tool. Teaching in the American seminary world and publishing between 2016 and 2022, he participates in the broader ressourcement trajectory associated with figures such as **Scott Swain**, **James Dolezal**, and **Matthew Levering**, yet he distinguishes himself by integrating thick exegesis with **metaphysical clarity**. The ecclesial and intellectual context is one in which doctrines like **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** have been labeled unbiblical or Hellenizing. Duby reframes this polemic by showing that classical predicates are disciplined ways of confessing the **Creator-creature distinction** demanded by biblical revelation.

At the core of Duby’s method stands a retrieval of **Reformed scholastic** rules for theological science, especially the duplex principium as articulated by **Franciscus Junius** in the distinction between *theologia archetypa* and *theologia ectypa*. This yields a sustained emphasis on analogical knowledge of God, a carefully delimited **analogical predication** that follows both the *via negativa* and the *via eminentiae*. He draws heavily on **Aquinas** for the grammar of predication and on **Herman Bavinck** for an organic vision of dogmatics, yet he situates both within a confessional Reformed horizon indebted to **Francis Turretin** and **Petrus van Mastricht**. The programmatic claim is that Scripture not only permits but demands a controlled **metaphysics** if we are to confess the oneness and life of the **triune God** without collapsing Creator and creature.

Duby’s methodological essays defend the use of **actus purus**, **simpliciter** and **subsistent relations** for the doctrine of God, while resisting any freestanding **analogia entis** detached from revelation. For him, *verbum Dei* provides the material content and judgment; metaphysical terms are conceptual instruments to safeguard claims such as **God’s aseity** and **God’s impassibility** that stand at the heart of biblical naming. The theological workflow begins with exegesis of texts like Exodus 3.14, Malachi 3.6, James 1.17, John 1 and 5, and only thereafter deploys **classical metaphysics** to preserve the content, thus aligning with **Reformed catholicity** that valorizes both **patristic** and **scholastic** retrieval.

#### 2. Divine simplicity and the grammar of perfection
Duby’s first monograph, **Divine Simplicity: A Dogmatic Account** (2016), offers a systematic case for **simplicity** as the proper grammar of divine perfection and unicity. The doctrine that in God essence and existence are identical, and that **attributes** are not parts in God but identical with the simple essence, is presented as the conceptual corollary of biblical monotheism. Duby argues from **Scripture** that God is the One whose being is underived and immutable, attending to divine names such as I AM and the biblical exclusion of change and defect. He then shows how the **Reformed orthodox** and **Aquinas** used simplicity to rule out composition by parts, form and matter, act and potency, essence and existence, or accident and subject in God. In this light he reads **Westminster Confession 2.1** as an authoritative, catholic summary: God is without body, parts, or passions, most absolute, most holy, most free.

A signature strength of Duby’s argument is his handling of modern analytic objections. Against **Alvin Plantinga** and others who charge that **simplicity** collapses divine attributes into a featureless unity or undermines **personal agency**, Duby distinguishes real identity in God from the multiplicity of our conceptions, invoking **analogical predication** and the scholastic notion that distinctions in our thought do not entail composition in God. He resists the **modal collapse** worry by articulating God’s freedom as a mode of willing that is necessary *ad intra* but contingent with respect to the specific content of the **decree** *ad extra*. Here the grammar of **pure act** is deployed to assert that God’s actual willing is eternally identical with his essence, while its created effects remain genuinely contingent. In a Reformed key, he invokes **Calvin’s autotheos** to reaffirm the Son’s aseity according to his **divine nature**, integrating simplicity with **relations of origin** so that the personal distinctions subsist in the simple essence as real relations, not parts.

Duby’s constructive retrieval addresses the often-traded allegation that **simplicity** is foreign to **biblical exegesis**. He demonstrates that the inner logic of Scriptures proclamation of Yahweh as the living God excludes all forms of composition that imply dependence or mutability. The One who is the giver of all good gifts without shadow of turning, as James 1.17 puts it, cannot be an assemblage of properties. In this way Duby shows that classical **simplicity** is an exegetical entailment harnessed by **metaphysical discipline**, and not an ontological speculation superadded to revelation.

#### 3. God in Himself and the Scripture-metaphysics relation
The second major work, **God in Himself: Scripture, Metaphysics, and the Task of Christian Theology** (2019), extends Duby’s program by asking how we may speak of God *ad intra* with confidence and humility. The book sets out to rebut the claim, dominant in strands of **Barthian** and postliberal theology, that **metaphysics** is either alien to or corrosive of biblical faith. For Duby, Scripture’s witness to God’s life and perfection invites orderly reasoning in which metaphysical terms are submitted to the canon of **pro-Nicene** confession. He leans on **Augustine**, **Athanasius**, and **John of Damascus** for the axiom that the **opera trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa**, and on **Aquinas** for the logic of *ipsum esse subsistens*. The point is not to elevate philosophy, but to specify the grammar that avoids creaturely projection when confessing **God’s blessedness**.

A crucial thread in God in Himself is the retrieval of **analogy** as the only mode of predication befitting the Creator. Duby argues against both univocity that domesticates God and equivocity that renders God unknowable, charting a path via **Reformed scholastic** norms that insist on the unity of truth across **Scripture**, theology, and a ministerial **philosophy**. He articulates the *via negativa* through denials of composition, passibility, and dependence, and the *via eminentiae* by amplifying creaturely perfections in light of **divine infinity**. Again, the concern is decidedly dogmatic and exegetical: he expounds biblical texts on God’s life, knowledge, and love, and then shows how **metaphysical** clarification secures their consistent confession without anthropomorphism.

In sustained debate with **Eberhard Jüngel**, **Robert Jenson**, and **Bruce McCormack**, Duby maintains that identifying God’s being with his **history** or **act** in the economy risks subordinating theology proper to economy. He counter-asserts the classical distinction of *theologia* and *oikonomia* while interrelating them: the missions reveal who God is as he is, but the identity revealed does not arise from the history. The payoff is a stable **immutability** and **impassibility** that buttress God’s covenant faithfulness and guarantee of salvation, themes deeply prized in **Reformed** soteriology.

#### 4. Christology in light of classical theism
Duby’s third monograph, **Jesus and the God of Classical Theism: Biblical Christology in Light of the Doctrine of God** (2022), turns to the person and work of Christ as the hermeneutical theater in which a biblical **classical theism** must prove its fidelity. Against proposals that see the incarnation as requiring revision of **immutability** or **impassibility**, Duby retrieves the **Chalcedonian** and **pro-Nicene** toolset: the **hypostatic union**, the **two natures** without confusion or change, and the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity. He reads Johannine claims such as I and the Father are one and the Son doing whatever the Father does as positive warrants for a metaphysically thick divine identity that does not ebb or flow with temporal events. The cross is then confessed with the **theopaschite formula**: one of the Trinity suffered in the flesh, where suffering is truly predicated of the incarnate Son according to the **human nature**.

This christological work is also an extended exegetical rebuttal to the charge that **classical theism** cannot handle the biblical data of Jesus’ growth, learning, temptation, and suffering. Duby follows **Athanasius** and **Cyril** in attributing creaturely predicates to the person of the Son according to the assumed nature while preserving the **impassibility** of the divinity. The doctrine of the **extra Calvinisticum** secures that the eternal Son is not circumscribed by the human nature and continues to be present and active beyond the flesh even while truly united to it. In this frame, **opera trinitatis ad extra indivisa** grounds a unified soteriology: the triune God acts in the missions through the Son incarnate and the Spirit, without partition of will or operation within the Godhead.

Engagements with **Jürgen Moltmann** and **Robert Jenson** sharpen Duby’s insistence that divine **impassibility** does not entail apathy but rather the infinite plenitude of divine life. He aligns with **Paul Gavrilyuk’s** historical work on theologies of emotion and divine suffering, showing that the patristic denial of passions defended the ardor of **divine love** as uncaused and indefectible. The result is a christology that protects both the **gospel’s** reliability and the genuine history of Jesus, in line with **Reformed confessional** commitments.

#### 5. Interlocutors, allies, and disciplinary contributions
Throughout his corpus Duby is in respectful conversation with **analytic theology** while not capitulating to its typical methods. He responds to **Ryan Mullins** on divine temporality and personhood by reaffirming **timeless eternity** and non-competitive agency, arguing that the timeless God can be Lord of temporal effects in virtue of his **pure actuality**. He welcomes **James Dolezal’s** polemics for classical theism while broadening the exegetical base and retrieving **Reformed scholastic** strategies for harmonizing simplicity with trinitarian **relations of origin**. With **Scott Swain**, he promotes **pro-Nicene** metaphysics, especially the rule that all external works of the Trinity are undivided and appropriations are semantic conveniences rather than real partitions in God.

Historically, Duby stands within the trajectory clarified by **Richard Muller’s** historiography on **post-Reformation Reformed dogmatics**, emphasizing continuity with **Aquinas** on **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **impassibility**. He also benefits from **Bavinck’s** modern classicism, especially the insistence that mystery invites, rather than forbids, careful conceptualization. His style is exegetically patient, historically capacious, and conceptually compact, rendering him a reliable guide for pastors and scholars seeking to inhabit catholic **theology proper** within a **Reformed** idiom.

#### 6. Scripture as rule, metaphysics as servant
A recurring thread is Duby’s insistence that theological discourse is normed by **Scripture** and its rule of faith. He treats metaphysics as a set of **second-order** clarifications submitted to biblical judgments. Thus he grounds **aseity** in texts that confess God as the one who has life in himself, **immutability** in the constancy of the covenant Lord, **impassibility** in the abundant affirmation of God’s freedom from created causality, and **simplicity** in the singularity and fullness of the divine name. At each point he refuses to deduce doctrinal content from abstract first principles detached from the *verbum Dei*, even when he articulates **actus purus** or **subsistent relations**.

This Scripture-governed posture yields an account of **analogy** that is theological before it is philosophical. The analogia is grounded in **creation** and **providence**, not in a neutral metaphysical bridge. Here the **Creator-creature distinction** authorizes predications that are really informative of God while remaining modest about cognitive reach. Duby’s reliance on **Junius** and **Turretin** for the rules of holy doctrine keeps his metaphysics in a confessional orbit, safeguarding **Reformed orthodoxy** while proposing a coherent way to answer modern challenges.

#### 7. Coherence of the system: Trinity, decree, and providence
The dogmatic web Duby weaves shows high internal coherence across **Trinity**, **decree**, and **providence**. **Relations of origin** supply the personal distinctions in the **simple** essence and avoid tritheism by making the numerically one essence the identity of each person. The **decree** is eternal, simple, and free, such that God’s willing of the world is not a response to external factors but a contingent expression of his goodness *ad extra*. **Providence** follows as the wise ordering of all things without competitive causality, precisely because **pure act** is not a cause among causes but the transcendent source of being. In this frame, doctrines like **reprobation** and **effectual calling** can be confessed without imputing passibility or change to God, because the entire economy unfolds as the temporal effect of an immutable, singular divine act.

By anchoring the **gospel** in the **doctrine of God**, Duby underscores how soteriology rests upon theology proper. The permanence of divine love stems from **immutability**; the reliability of the promise relies on **simplicity**; the sufficiency of Christ’s work depends on **inseparable operations** and the **extra Calvinisticum**. The whole is an act of Reformed **catholicity**, where medieval and patristic insights are received through the sieve of confessional standards.

#### 8. Reception, pedagogy, and continuing influence
In the **Reformed** and evangelical academy, Duby’s work has been received as a serious and trustworthy contribution to the retrieval of **classical theism**. Pastors and students find in his books accessible paths into difficult questions about **simplicity** and **impassibility**, precisely because he keeps **Scripture** in the foreground while patiently deploying metaphysical grammar. His essays and public lectures often clarify the **inseparable operations** of the Trinity for biblical interpretation, enriching Christological and pneumatological exegesis. By curating conversation between **patristic sources**, **Reformed scholastics**, and **analytic philosophers**, he models a non-defensive, confident dogmatics committed to catholic truth.

Theologically, Duby’s influence is especially notable in classrooms and ecclesial settings that confess the **Westminster Standards** or the **Three Forms of Unity**, where his case for **God without body, parts, or passions** is both familiar and freshly defended. Among interlocutors supportive of **natural law** and **classical metaphysics** he is a valued partner. At the same time, his careful demarcations have encouraged critical but constructive dialogue with proponents of **theistic personalism**, **open theism**, and **relational theism**, keeping the debate anchored in shared concerns about biblical fidelity and the coherence of **theology proper**.

#### 9. Limits, tensions, and prospects
No retrieval is without tensions, and Duby’s are candidly acknowledged. His advocacy of **actus purus** and robust **simplicity** invites the perennial challenge of articulating created contingency without **modal collapse** and of securing God’s **personal agency** without composition. He answers with **analogical predication** and conceptual distinctions, joined to the pro-Nicene insight that **relations of origin** are real and sufficient to ground personal plurality. His use of **metaphysics** is programmatically subordinate to **Scripture**, yet the idiom itself can seem foreign to exegetical culture, raising pedagogical hurdles. Duby’s response is to show, case by case, how biblical claims require such grammar to be faithfully confessed and how **Reformed scholasticism** historically did just that.

He also navigates the widespread anxiety that **impassibility** denies divine compassion. By retrieving the patristic distinction between passions that imply defect and the non-passional **love** and **mercy** of God, he reframes the discussion. If love is the plenitude of benevolence in God rather than the effect of an external cause, then the cross reveals rather than produces divine compassion. These moves leave room for further work on divine **affections**, perhaps drawing more deeply on the **affections** language in **Jonathan Edwards** while retaining classical strictures against passibility.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a confessional **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage point, Duby’s project exemplifies principled retrieval: a robust defense of **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** in line with **Westminster 2.1** and the **Reformed orthodox**. Strengths include his clear submission of **metaphysics** to **Scripture**, his use of **Junius’s** archetypal-ectypal distinction, and his integration of **inseparable operations** and **extra Calvinisticum** into **Christology** and **Trinity**. Tensions arise around the idiom of **Thomistic** *actus purus* and the specter of an **analogia entis*, where some Van Tilian readers will worry that any appeal to shared metaphysical categories blurs the covenantal cast of the **Creator-creature distinction**. Duby mitigates this by rooting analogy in creation and revelation rather than autonomous reason, yet an alternative accent could place the **covenant** as the supreme architectonic principle, calibrating **natural theology** through the history of **special revelation**. Similarly, one might press that divine **freedom** and **personal agency** be explicated less through act-potency grammar and more through the biblical idiom of **covenant lordship**. Still, within the canons of classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, Duby’s account is both legitimate and salutary, a disciplined exemplar of Scripture-governed metaphysics that strengthens preaching, catechesis, and worship of the **triune God** who is without body, parts, or passions.
