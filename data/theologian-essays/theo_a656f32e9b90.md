### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Andy Crouch, born 1967, writes from within broad **evangelical** networks shaped by campus ministry and public discourse, moving from **InterVarsity Christian Fellowship** in the 1990s into editorial leadership at **Christianity Today** in the mid-2000s and then to **Praxis** in 2017. His historical moment is the late modern **United States**, marked by the rise of the **digital platform economy**, the erosion of mediating **institutions**, and a widening gap between personal agency and systemic complexity. These conditions frame his central theological concern: what does faithful **image-bearing** mean in a world where **power** seems either exploitative or absent, and where **technology** has become a quasi-liturgical environment. Crouch’s method is practical-theological and narratival, trading on the canonical arc of **creation-fall-redemption** and a thick reading of **Genesis 1–3** that foregrounds the **cultural mandate**. He draws from the sociology of **institutions**, from **cultural anthropology**, and from the philosophical critique of **technique** associated with **Jacques Ellul** and the **device paradigm** associated with **Albert Borgmann**, while maintaining a devotional, church-facing register consonant with evangelical **discipleship**.

This methodological posture gives Crouch a double orientation, toward biblical **theology** and toward the concrete **habitus** of communal life. Theologically, he frames human vocation in terms of *imago Dei*, culture as the making and tending of artifacts and traditions in the **polis**, and the blessed order of **Sabbath** and labor. Ethically, he speaks with pastoral urgency about **idolatry** as the misdirection of worship toward created powers. Epistemically, he is an integrator rather than a scholastic systematizer, working with thick description and accessible typologies rather than metaphysical theses, yet he anchors every analysis in core **doctrines** of creation and personhood.

#### 2. Culture Making: posture and vocation
Crouch’s breakthrough book, **Culture Making** 2008, reframed evangelical debates that had been dominated by posture verbs like condemning, critiquing, copying, and consuming. He argued that the Christian response to culture should be creating and cultivating, an active extension of the **cultural mandate** that resonates with **Abraham Kuyper’s** claim that Christ declares mine over every square inch. Culture, for Crouch, is what we make of the world, both in the sense of artifacts and in the sense of interpretations, hence **culture making** is inherently theological because making images is either a renewal of *imago Dei* or a lapse into **idolatry**. He highlights the structural power of **institutions**, from households to guilds to corporations, as the durable carriers of cultural goods across time, which echoes **James Davison Hunter’s** focus on **faithful presence** within elite and ordinary locations of influence.

Within this argument Crouch uses key distinctions that have become catechetical within evangelical discourse. He differentiates gestures, one-time actions, from postures, stable **virtues** that endure, urging Christians to develop a posture of **cultivation** toward the good and a posture of **creation** toward the lacking. The framework is not a naïve transformationalism, since he weaves in a serious account of **fallenness** and the counter-liturgies of **Babel** that twist even our best cultural efforts. Nevertheless, the prevailing tone is one of non-naïve hope grounded in the **resurrection**, which for Crouch legitimates culture as a field of grace and responsibility rather than an arena of inevitable compromise.

#### 3. Power, image-bearing, and idolatry
In **Playing God: Redeeming the Gift of Power** 2013, Crouch pivots to the category of **power** understood as the capacity for meaningful action. This definition, indebted to both biblical theology and organizational theory, resists the zero-sum suspicion of power common in late modern critique, and instead rehabilitates **authority** as ordered power that enables the flourishing of others. At the heart of the book is the claim that power, rightly engaged, is an intensification of *imago Dei*, since the God of **Genesis** endows humans with the charge to name, to tend, and to bless. The shadow of power is **idolatry**, which Crouch casts as the bid to compress risk, to shift vulnerability onto others, and to secure benefits without reciprocal accountability, a reading that echoes **Augustine’s** teaching on **disordered loves** and resonates with **Ellul’s** suspicion of autonomous technique.

Crouch’s analysis of **institutions** is both appreciative and admonitory. Institutions are necessary to sustain cultural goods across generations, but they are prone to idolatrous **self-preservation**, especially when metrics and incentives decouple from the **telos** of human and creational flourishing. The constructive pastoral counsel is to practice **blessing** rather than grasping, to choose the slow grain of craft over the exploitative speed of magic, and to embrace **vulnerability** as the cruciform mode of genuine authority. The leitmotif throughout is image-bearing as a vocation to grant others meaningful action, which recasts leadership in unmistakably **Christological** terms.

#### 4. Authority and vulnerability
Crouch distilled the power thesis in **Strong and Weak** 2016 into a two-axis model that has entered common evangelical vocabulary. The quadrants plot **authority** on one axis and **vulnerability** on the other. Exploitation, high authority with low vulnerability, names the predatory use of power. Suffering, low authority with high vulnerability, names the crucible that must be relieved. Withdrawal, low authority with low vulnerability, names our late modern retreat into distraction and safety. Flourishing, high authority with high vulnerability, names the normative Christian pattern, which Crouch correlates with **Philippians 2** and the **kenosis** of Christ. The model functions as a diagnostic of persons and institutions and as a spiritual rule of life that commends chosen exposure for the sake of others’ empowerment.

The deeper anthropology here is a synthesis of biblical **personhood** and organizational realities. To be human is to be entrusted with **dominion** as stewardship, to face risk and loss, and to receive power as a gift to be poured out. The matrix is thus both an ethic of leadership and a filter for evaluating **systems**. It invites communities to become laboratories of **courage** and **restraint**, refusing both the safety of apathy and the grasp of domination. In this way, Crouch’s authority-vulnerability schema becomes a lived hermeneutic of the cross that interrogates the **principalities and powers** without demonizing the possibility of authority itself.

#### 5. Technology, device paradigm, and households
With **The Tech-Wise Family** 2017 and **My Tech-Wise Life** 2020, Crouch applies his theological anthropology to the domain of **technology**, drawing explicitly on **Albert Borgmann’s** **device paradigm** and implicitly on **Jacques Ellul’s** critique of autonomous **technique**. He argues that modern devices trade real skill for convenience, yielding the illusion of control and the reality of **dependency**. The core pastoral claim is that the home, as **household** or *oikos*, should be an **infrastructure of grace**, a setting for durable attention, music, meals, and shared labor, rather than a portal to infinite distraction. He recommends simple habits, like keeping devices out of bedrooms, making the most important place the most beautiful, and practicing rhythms of **Sabbath** that interrupt the liturgies of **easy-everywhere**.

These works are not technology jeremiads but invitations to reconfigure **liturgies** of desire. Crouch names the moral deformation of infinite scroll and algorithmic curation, but his prescriptive center is a recovery of presence, song, and skill, which evoke **Augustinian** themes of order and love. He insists that formation is habituated and environmental, that architectural choices and daily patterns catechize us as surely as confessions do. By situating the **household** as the basic unit of change, he both retrieves biblical and classical **oikos** and aligns with **Kuyperian** sphere sovereignty that assigns discrete responsibilities to family, church, and civil society.

#### 6. The Life We are Looking For: personhood, mammon, and recognition
In **The Life We are Looking For** 2022, Crouch offers his most integrated vision of **personhood** and society, organized by Jesus’s fourfold command to love with heart, soul, mind, and strength. He contends that modern devices offer borrowed **superpowers** without commensurate **maturity**, producing fragmentation of the self and a loneliness that cannot be overcome by connectivity. The heart of the book is a plea for recognition, for being known by name rather than as data within the economy of **mammon**, a term Crouch uses to name the amalgam of money, measurement, and control that tempts us to instrumentalize people. He presses for the recovery of three circles, the **person**, the **household**, and the **institution**, reoriented to bless persons rather than harvest attention.

Crouch’s theological grammar in this volume is quietly **Augustinian** and openly **evangelical**. He treats desire as the engine of culture and insists that worship reforms desire toward **God’s glory** and neighbor’s good. He invokes the church as the **household of God**, though his ecclesiology remains implicit, and appeals to the example of **Jesus** whose ministry confers attention and agency on those made invisible by systems. The book’s signature move is to translate big critiques of **surveillance capitalism** into accessible commitments, like structured **limits**, intergenerational households, and the cultivation of craft. The result is a spirituality of embodied presence that confronts technicized abstraction with the simple, costly acts of **blessing**.

#### 7. Institutions, entrepreneurship, and redemptive practice
Crouch’s partnership with **Praxis** since 2017 extends his theological anthropology into the arena of **entrepreneurship** and organizational design. He champions **redemptive entrepreneurship**, summarized as creative restoration through sacrifice, a phrase that aligns institutional purpose with the **cross** rather than merely with growth or social impact. This is a theology of work and organization that eschews both sacred-secular bifurcation and market romanticism, resonating with **Dorothy Sayers** on vocation and **Oliver O’Donovan** on the redeemed order of **power**. The practical counsel is exacting, urging founders and boards to embrace **limits**, to elevate persons over scale, to avoid exploitative **metrics**, and to design policies that distribute authority without eliminating **vulnerability**.

Here Crouch’s earlier work on **culture making** and **idolatry** becomes institutional ethics. He calls organizations to resist the idol’s promise of predictable returns with no cost, to cultivate pace and patience consonant with **Sabbath**, and to attend to the marginal whom Jesus blesses. The Praxis frame is decidedly hopeful but not utopian, insisting that sanctification has organizational analogues and that failures must be met with truth-telling and **repentance**. The aspiration is to embed in the structures of the **saeculum** anticipations of the kingdom, not by coercion, but by witness to a different valuation of **personhood** and time.

#### 8. Scripture, anthropology, and the grammar of blessing
Across the corpus, certain exegetical and doctrinal threads recur. Crouch’s repeated return to **Genesis 1–2** grounds his talk of **authority** and **cultivation** in the blessing of fruitful dominion, against both domination and abdication. His reading of **Philippians 2** and the **Gospels** shapes his treatise on **vulnerability**, which he refuses to call weakness in the pejorative sense, treating it instead as the chosen exposure that mirrors the **kenotic** pattern of Christ. He gestures toward **principalities and powers** language from **Ephesians** and **Colossians**, linking idolatry to systemic captivity without dissolving personal responsibility. He treats **Sabbath** and worship as structuring practices, not as legal demands, and he insists that the **Holy Spirit** renews the imagination to see persons rather than problems.

The anthropological core is a synthetic portrait of the human as relational **image-bearer**, fashioned for meaningful action and mutual recognition *coram Deo*, before God. Crouch’s signature terms like **blessing**, **vulnerability**, and **household** provide a pastoral grammar that translates doctrines of creation and providence into daily rule. He is not a speculative metaphysician of **nature and grace**, yet his work leans on an analogical confidence that creation’s structures, though fallen, remain apt for redemption. The net effect is a catechesis for late modern Christians worried about power, exhausted by devices, and longing for **community** that endures.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** standpoint, especially in a Westminster Theological Seminary frame, Crouch’s project displays significant strengths and some instructive tensions. Positively, his retrieval of the **cultural mandate**, his defense of ordered **authority**, and his refusal to demonize **institutions** cohere with **Kuyperian** affirmations of **common grace** and **sphere sovereignty**. His account of **idolatry** is Augustinian and Calvinian, and his emphasis on **Sabbath**, **household**, and **blessing** resonates with a covenantal reading of **creation** as good and ordered. His critique of the **device paradigm** and **mammon** echoes **Ellul** while keeping a chastened but active posture more typical of neocalvinist engagement. In sum, he provides a pastoral ethics of culture that is unusually aligned with Reformed creation-affirmation.

The tensions concern theological concentration and ecclesial specificity. Crouch’s organizing telos is often framed as **human flourishing**, a scriptural theme yet prone to therapeutic capture unless rigorously tethered to **God’s glory** and the **covenant of grace** administered by **Word and sacrament**. A WTS critique would ask for thickened **ecclesiology**, since his primary vehicles of change are the **household** and the **institution**, while the **church** as visible, disciplined communion and the ministry of the **means of grace** remain backgrounded. His anthropology elevates **vulnerability** as a cross-shaped virtue, yet requires dogmatic rooting in **union with Christ** and the definitive **antithesis** between the present evil age and the age to come lest vulnerability become a general virtue rather than a cruciform participation. Finally, his constructive hope for **institutions** sometimes risks underestimating the noetic and moral effects of **total depravity** on structures, a point on which two-kingdom exponents would press for a clearer distinction of **special revelation** and the limits of cultural **redemption**. The Reformed alternative is not withdrawal but a more explicit Christological and ecclesial center: **preaching**, **sacrament**, and **discipline** as the engine of renewal, with **common grace** restraining and permitting penultimate goods in culture, and **eschatology** guarding the church from confusing proximate reform with the coming **consummation**.
