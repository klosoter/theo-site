### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, Context, and Method
Benjamin D. Sommer emerged in the late twentieth century as a leading scholar of the **Hebrew Bible** situated at the intersection of **historical-critical method** and constructive Jewish theology. Trained in the University of Chicago milieu shaped by **philology**, the **history of religions** school, and **source and redaction criticism**, Sommer absorbed the comparative impulse of **Ancient Near Eastern** studies associated with figures like **Frank Moore Cross** and **Mark S. Smith**. After teaching at **Northwestern University** through the 1990s and 2000s and moving to the **Jewish Theological Seminary** in 2008, he consolidated a distinctive approach that treats the **Tanakh** not only as a historical artifact but as a living source for **revelation and authority**. His method binds close reading of Hebrew poetics to **inner-biblical exegesis**, construed through the lens of **Michael Fishbane** and **James Kugel**, while maintaining the program of **source criticism** and **redactional composition** as indispensable for theological claims grounded in textual growth and transmission.

Sommer’s epistemic stance marries critical inquiry with a loyal posture toward **halakhic** and **aggadic** tradition, articulated as **participatory revelation** rather than positivist dictation. He insists that **philology** and **redaction criticism** are not corrosive to belief but can narrate how Israel encountered the **divine voice** in and through the processes of inscription, compilation, and reception. This stance yields a reflexive method that reads the **canon as conversation**, attending to seams and contradictions as productive sites of theology. Theologically, Sommer stands within the orbit of Conservative Judaism, mediating between rationalist **Maimonidean** claims about **divine incorporeality** and the more mythopoetic impulses of **Kabbalah**, and he does so through a disciplined **historical-critical** frame rather than through systematic philosophy alone.

#### 2. Early Work: Allusion, Scribal Prophecy, and Canon as Conversation
Sommer’s first monograph, **A Prophet Reads Scripture** in 1998, analyzes **Second Isaiah** as a reader and reinterpreter of earlier traditions, demonstrating the ubiquity and sophistication of **inner-biblical allusion**. Adapting the insights of **Michael Fishbane** on inner-biblical exegesis and the poetics of **intertextuality**, Sommer argues that prophetic discourse is a scribal act that re-voices foundational materials from **Exodus**, **Deuteronomy**, and **Zion traditions**, thereby shaping new theology in the act of citation. The prophet becomes a theologian who re-authorizes tradition, producing both continuity and creative revision. Sommer’s commitment to **philology** appears in detailed analyses of lexical echoes, compositional technique, and rhetorical structure, while his theological thesis emerges clearly: revelation proceeds through the community’s learned reuse of its own canon.

This early work establishes two motifs that thread through Sommer’s later corpus. First is the insistence on **revelation through redaction**, where the final forms of texts record a divine pedagogy embedded in the process of literary growth. Second is the claim that **authority** is witness-based, resident in the interplay between **God**, **Israel**, and the received Scriptures as they are reread across time. Sommer thus aligns with a descriptively thick account of **canon as conversation**, one that refuses to hide fissures or harmonize away tensions, because these tensions are themselves signals of the divine-human dialogue inscribed in the Bible’s layered composition.

#### 3. The Bodies of God: Divine Fluidity and Complex Monotheism
In **The Bodies of God and the World of Ancient Israel** in 2009, Sommer advances a bold thesis: ancient Israelite religion often presupposed **divine fluidity**, a mode of **complex monotheism** in which the one **YHWH** can be present in multiple, simultaneous **bodies** or hypostatic manifestations. Drawing on **Ugaritic** and **Akkadian** comparanda alongside biblical texts such as **Genesis 18**, **Exodus 24**, **Joshua 5**, and **1 Kings 8**, he distinguishes early Israel’s fluid ontology from the later insistence on **divine incorporeality** typified by **Maimonides**. Sommer treats the **Name theology** in **Deuteronomy** and **Chronicles**, the **Kavod** or **Glory** in **Ezekiel**, and the **Angel of YHWH** traditions as evidence of multiplicity-within-unity, arguing that Israel’s God can localize presence without ceasing to be transcendent, and can distribute agency across manifestations without fragmenting identity.

This reconstruction of **complex monotheism** has two major implications. First, it revises the genealogy of Jewish theology, showing that the move to strict **divine incorporeality** is not the only or earliest biblical trajectory, and that later **Hellenistic Jewish** rationalism and **medieval Aristotelian** metaphysics displaced earlier imaginations of divine presence. Second, it creates an unexpected bridge to **Christian** claims about **incarnation**, as Sommer explicitly notes that the Hebrew Bible’s model of **multiple embodiment** shows that a single deity may inhabit more than one body simultaneously. The point is not to affirm Christian dogma but to deny that it necessarily violates biblical **monotheism**. Sommer’s historical-critical work thus becomes an intervention in contemporary theology, pressing Jews and Christians to reread **anthropomorphic** and **hypostatic** language not as naive myth but as serious metaphysical grammar within Israel’s faith.

#### 4. Revelation and Authority: Sinai as Event and Process
Sommer’s major constructive statement appears in **Revelation and Authority** in 2015, which reframes **Sinai** as both an historical event and an ongoing **process** of **participatory revelation**. He contends that the Torah itself narrates the mediation of the divine word through human scribes, reflected in the multiple voices, contradictions, and redactional strata detected by **source criticism**. Rather than reading such phenomena as defects, Sommer proposes they are intrinsic to how God reveals, enlisting Israel as partner in the shaping of **Torah**. The category of **participatory revelation** names this dynamic: God initiates and commands, yet human interpreters, prophets, and sages contribute to the very form and content of the canonical word over time.

This thesis reframes **halakhic authority**. Sommer critiques both maximalist dictation models that collapse the **divine voice** into an unmediated transcript and minimalist liberal models that reduce Torah to human ethical insight. He sketches a middle way in which normative law retains **commandedness** while acknowledging that its specific articulations and applications are worked out in the community’s learning and disputes. The **Sinai event** therefore extends into the processes of **scribalism**, **redaction**, and **rabbinic halakhic** argument, yielding an account of authority that is both historical and binding. Sommer reads **Deuteronomy** as paradigmatic, where Moses retells and reshapes revelation, thereby inscribing in the canon a theology of iterative reception. In this way, **historical criticism** becomes an ally of **normative theology**, because it uncovers the divine pedagogy in textual growth rather than dismantling it.

#### 5. Scripture, Tradition, and Interreligious Implications
Sommer’s integration of **historical-critical** method and **normative** claim yields a distinctive theology of Scripture and tradition that has interreligious consequences. By arguing for **divine fluidity** and **multiple embodiment**, he pushes against the absolutizing of **Maimonidean** **divine simplicity** and corporeal negation, opening space for a Jewish acknowledgment that **incarnational** grammar need not be idolatrous. Conversely, his stress on **Sinai as ongoing** undercuts Christian assertions of closed **special revelation** if construed in a way that denies ongoing divine instruction, even as it commends a shared commitment to **canonical authority**. Sommer thus occupies a dialogical posture that both challenges and invites, pressing for mutual reconsideration of how **monotheism**, **embodiment**, and **authority** cohere.

Within Jewish debates, Sommer’s approach reworks the contested phrase **Torah min ha-shamayim** by stating that Torah is from heaven in an historically mediated way. He invokes the living role of **rabbinic halakhah** as authorized continuation of revelation while resisting both historicism that dissolves the divine claim and fundamentalism that denies the evident composite character of the text. His constructive aim is a theologically serious **historical criticism** that can underwrite practice, where **philology** and piety are not enemies but partners under the rubric of **participatory revelation**.

#### 6. Exegetical Casework and Conceptual Tools
Sommer’s arguments are anchored in exegetical casework that illustrates his conceptual tools. His discussion of **Genesis 18** and **Exodus 24** shows how **theophany**, **eating and seeing God**, and **angelic identity** merge, sustaining the claim of **divine fluidity**. His analysis of **Deuteronomy’s Name theology** and **Ezekiel’s Kavod** provides a map of divine presence that is at once localized and transcendent, thereby grounding **complex monotheism** in textual details rather than in generalized theory. In terms of compositional theology, his readings of **Second Isaiah** in **A Prophet Reads Scripture** illuminate **intertextual allusion** as a mode of **canonical self-interpretation**, a practice that continues in **post-biblical** tradition. These cases display Sommer’s method at full stretch: historical comparison with **Ugaritic** and **Akkadian** religion, close **philological** analysis, and systematic claims about **revelation and authority**.

Importantly, Sommer repeatedly underscores the value of **contradiction** and **polyphony** for theological reasoning. The coexistence of **incorporeal** and **anthropomorphic** strands in the canon is not a problem to be solved but a field to be worked. For Sommer, such tensions invite communities into discernment, which is precisely how **participatory revelation** advances. The result is a theology that resists harmonization in favor of **dialectical** formation, in which divine truth addresses Israel through a plurality of voices and literary forms.

#### 7. Interlocutors and Intellectual Genealogy
Sommer’s work locates itself within and against a set of interlocutors. He affirms the **inner-biblical exegesis** program of **Michael Fishbane** and builds on **James Kugel’s** insights into the Bible’s own interpretive logic, while pressing further into the realm of **normative theology**. He appropriates the comparative methods of **Frank Moore Cross** and **Mark S. Smith** to show that Israel’s **complex monotheism** developed in dialogue with a broader **West Semitic** world. In contrast to **Maimonides**, whose **Guide of the Perplexed** codifies **divine incorporeality** and a strong doctrine of **simplicity**, Sommer retrieves older and alternate biblical grammars of divine presence that resemble some currents in **Kabbalah**, where hypostatic configurations articulate unity-in-complexity. With **Jon D. Levenson**, he shares a deep engagement with **Sinai** and **Zion** as theological poles, yet he extends this to a programmatic account of **authority** for contemporary Jewish life.

Across the aisle to Christian theology, Sommer’s argument for **multiple embodiment** enters debates on **incarnation** and **Trinity**, even when he stops short of affirming **trinitarian** dogma. His learning is also in conversation with scholars of divine mediation and **angelology**, with the figure of the **Angel of YHWH** serving as a test case for pre-Christian Jewish **hypostasis**. Throughout, Sommer maintains allegiance to the craft rules of **philology** and **source criticism**, while inviting constructive theological work to take the historical dossier with full seriousness.

#### 8. Reception, Impact, and Continuing Debates
The reception of Sommer’s corpus has been vigorous in **biblical studies** and **Jewish thought**, with **The Bodies of God** widely cited in discussions of **divine council**, **hypostatic personification**, and the myth-ritual matrix of Israel’s religion. His thesis of **divine fluidity** has influenced not only Jewish scholarship but also Christian and secular interpreters who reassess the boundary between **polytheism**, **henotheism**, and **monotheism** in ancient Israel. **Revelation and Authority** has animated debates within Conservative Judaism and beyond about whether **historical criticism** can underwrite **halakhic normativity**, with responses ranging from robust embrace to skeptical critique. The constructive upshot is that Sommer has shifted the plausibility structure for a normative, postcritical reading of **Torah** that neither retreats into precritical harmonization nor surrenders to historicist relativism.

In pedagogy and public theology, Sommer models scholarly accountability to the **sources** combined with the courage to make claims about **God** and **authority**. His work has encouraged a generation of students to see **philology** as a spiritual discipline and **source criticism** as a window onto the divine pedagogy. The durability of his key categories, especially **complex monotheism** and **participatory revelation**, indicates a conceptual contribution that travels across confessional lines while remaining anchored in the **Hebrew Bible** and its **Ancient Near Eastern** world.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS Evaluation
From a classical Reformed vantage shaped by **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability**, Sommer’s retrieval of **divine fluidity** and **multiple embodiment** presses a sharp question. The Reformed tradition reads anthropomorphic theophanies through an **accommodation** doctrine, locating corporeal descriptions in the register of God’s condescension rather than in God’s ontological form. The biblical **Angel of YHWH**, the **Kavod**, and the **Name** are received as modes of self-revelation of the simple triune God rather than as instances of an ontologically fluid deity. On this point, Sommer’s historical reconstruction names a genuine pattern of biblical discourse, but a classical theist will insist that the Creator-creature distinction and the aseity of the **triune Lord** require reading embodiment phenomenologically rather than metaphysically. Likewise, Sommer’s **participatory revelation** rightly honors the **organic inspiration** of Scripture through human authors and the real plurality within the canon, resonant with **Bavinck** and **Warfield** on concursus. Yet the Reformed doctrine of **verbal plenary inspiration** and the finality of **special revelation** in the prophetic-apostolic canon cannot countenance an ongoing expansion of revelation in halakhic process as revelation in the strict sense, though it affirms ongoing **illumination** and **ecclesial interpretation**. Reformed theology can therefore receive Sommer’s robust **philology**, his attention to **canonical intertextuality**, and his covenantal instinct for **authority** as helpful provocations, while dissenting at principle where **divine simplicity** is displaced by **complex monotheism** and where the canon’s closure as covenant document is blurred by a theory of continuing **Sinai**.
