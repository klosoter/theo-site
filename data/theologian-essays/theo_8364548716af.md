### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Greg Forster emerges from the contemporary American evangelical and **Reformed** world as a political theologian and public intellectual whose thesis is that the **joy of the gospel** must become socially visible through institutions shaped by **vocation** and **common grace**. Educated in political theory and working at the intersection of theology and public life, notably through leadership in the **Oikonomia Network** at Trinity, he writes in a late-modern context marked by the collapse of Christendom, the recrudescence of **secular liberalism**, and fatigue with Right-Left culture war binaries. His intellectual landscape is triangulated among **John Locke**, **John Calvin**, and **Abraham Kuyper**, with **Augustine** providing the deep structure of a two-loves anthropology that tempers expectations for politics. Methodologically he refuses both fideist withdrawal and rationalist autonomy, commending a chastened **natural law** recognizable to reason, underwritten by **general revelation** and stabilized by **Reformed** doctrines of **creation** and **providence**. The wager is that the church’s catechesis in **union with Christ** will bear public fruit as **agape**-formed citizens seek the **common good** within the creational orders of work, family, and civil society.

Forster frames his project as a retrieval and recalibration: retrieve the **Reformed doctrines of grace** as pastoral balm and public catalyst, and recalibrate evangelical engagement away from momentary activism toward long-term **institutional formation**. He openly rejects theocratic nostalgias and the naked public square alike, seeking what he terms **public moral consensus** within a **principled pluralism** that honors religious liberty and the **imago Dei**. His epistemic stance is Augustinian and Kuyperian at once: a strong doctrine of the **noetic effects of sin** forbids naive rationalism, while **common grace** opens a space where believers and unbelievers can cooperate in limited, penultimate goods through *lex naturalis*. This yields a methodological middle path: confessionally Christian in source and telos, genuinely dialogical in public rationale, and attentive to history as providentially ordered.

#### 2. Locke, liberalism, and the moral consensus thesis
The backbone of Forster’s historical work is **John Locke's Politics of Moral Consensus** 2005, a revisionist account arguing that Locke’s political philosophy is unintelligible apart from a Protestant moral theology centered on the **law of nature**, **charity**, and the **imago Dei**. Against secularist or Straussian portraits that reduce Locke to thin individualism, Forster reconstructs the theological architecture of Locke’s **natural rights** within a divine order where duties to God ground rights among neighbors. He foregrounds Locke’s insistence that all people are owned by God, that property is stewardship conditioned by labor and scarcity, and that **toleration** is a Christian imperative for civic peace. In doing so he situates Locke within the ferment of dissenting Protestantism, resonant with **Reformed** covenantal sensibilities about accountability before a sovereign Lord. The upshot is the possibility of a **public moral consensus** anchored in accessible truths of nature and Scripture without civil imposition of sectarian dogma.

Forster popularizes and extends this thesis in subsequent writings, arguing that **liberal democracy** at its best depends upon a moral ontology that the **Reformed** tradition can affirm: a creational order, a substantive account of the good, and limits on power articulated as rights because persons bear the **imago Dei**. Here he threads a needle between **Augustinian** realism and **Kuyperian** confidence. He accepts that politics, in an age after **Christendom**, cannot command ultimate allegiance and must respect **conscience**. Yet he resists the conclusion, associated with some heirs of **Hauerwas**, that political participation dissolves ecclesial integrity, claiming instead that the church can cultivate citizens whose virtues stabilize a just pluralism. The language of moral consensus becomes the lingua franca by which **Reformed** love of neighbor enters the public square.

#### 3. Church, state, and the contested square
In **The Contested Public Square** 2008 Forster narrates the drama of church and state from **Constantine** to modern America, diagnosing a cycle of overreach and exclusion in which both establishmentarianism and secularism impoverish public life. He appropriates **Augustine’s** two cities to commend neither sacral empire nor privatized faith but a chastened **civic theology** that separates institutional competencies while aligning moral ends. The book advances **principled pluralism** as a framework that rejects civil penalties for doctrinal dissent and protects robust religious exercise. Drawing appreciatively yet critically on **Richard John Neuhaus’s** naked public square critique, Forster argues that religious voices must neither dominate nor disappear, but must argue publicly from reasons that can be shared within a morally meaningful order.

Forster’s constructive proposal integrates **natural law** with **Reformed** emphases on covenantal accountability. Magistrates secure impartial **justice**, not ecclesial purity, while the church bears witness through proclamation and embodied **diakonia**. He is attuned to the American constitutional tradition, especially the **First Amendment** architecture that balances non-establishment with free exercise, and he reads this arrangement as a providential opportunity for the church to build alternative communities of **joy** and **service**. His Augustinianism puts steel in the spine against utopian projects and warns that politics cannot manufacture virtue. At the same time his Kuyperian instincts direct energy toward **sphere sovereignty**, in which families, schools, businesses, and charities pursue their own God-given ends under the Lordship of Christ.

#### 4. Soteriology as love: The Joy of Calvinism
With **The Joy of Calvinism** 2012 Forster turns from political genealogy to pastoral theology, reframing **TULIP** not as an arid system of decrees but as the grammar of **divine love** that is personal, unconditional, irresistible, and unbreakable. He writes as an evangelical Calvinist eager to heal caricatures of **predestination** by rooting election in the triune fellowship of **Father**, **Son**, and **Spirit**. **Unconditional election** is not arbitrary fate but the free, gracious choosing of sinners into adoption; **total depravity** is the honest account of our need that magnifies grace; **irresistible grace** is the Spirit’s efficacious call that begets living faith; and **perseverance of the saints** is the Father’s unwavering fidelity to the new covenant. The doctrinal center is **union with Christ**, by which believers participate in Christ’s life, death, and resurrection. Joy becomes both affect and act, a participation in **beatitudo** that stabilizes the heart for public vocation.

Forster’s soteriology is distinctly pastoral and catechetical. He treats **assurance**, **adoption**, and **providence** in ways that comfort ordinary believers and unsettle moralism. The rhetorical strategy is to put **love** at the front door of Calvinism so that readers grasp that the decrees are not impersonal mechanisms but expressions of a **personalist** God whose covenantal steadfastness frees rather than constrains. The book does not major on metaphysical debates about **divine simplicity** or **autotheos**, yet it presupposes a classic **monergism** that grounds human agency in prior grace. In Forster’s overall project this soteriological joy is the wellspring for missional presence in the world, converting the anxious habits of cultural defense into hopeful **neighbor-love**.

#### 5. Joy for the world: vocation, economy, and institutional renewal
In **Joy for the World** 2014 Forster widens the lens from individual salvation to corporate witness, arguing that the church’s most persuasive cultural strategy is to make **joy** visible through thick communities that serve the **common good**. He structures the account around three spheres: the **family**, the **workplace**, and the **public square**. Forster rejects celebrity activism and episodic outrage in favor of long-haul **discipleship**, especially in economic life where most adults spend most waking hours. He calls pastors to recover **vocation**, equipping believers to seek justice and excellence in their sectors, and he urges congregations to incorporate **economic wisdom** into catechesis. The book’s Kuyperian accent is explicit: Christ is Lord over every square inch, and **sphere sovereignty** means the church honors the legitimate autonomy of social institutions while leavening them with Christ-shaped practices.

This vision coheres with Forster’s leadership in the **Oikonomia Network**, a consortium that resources seminaries and churches to teach the **goodness of work**, **entrepreneurial stewardship**, and **neighborly exchange**. He draws on **Calvin’s** doctrine of vocation, aspects of **Catholic social thought** like **subsidiarity**, and contemporary economics in a way that resists both statism and market absolutism. The theological motor remains **common grace** and the **imago Dei**: because God sustains the world and endows all people with creative capacities, Christians can expect genuine though partial goods to be achieved in cooperation with others. Joy is not a private mood but a public sign of **shalom**, a foretaste of the kingdom that renders the gospel credible.

#### 6. Interlocutors: retrieval, critique, and constructive synthesis
Forster’s interlocutors range from classical sources to contemporary theorists. From **Augustine** he receives the two loves and an account of pride that disciplines political hopes; from **Calvin** he inherits **providence**, **vocation**, and a robust ecclesial piety; from **Kuyper** he adapts **sphere sovereignty** and the doctrine of **common grace** as conditions for cultural labor. His historical thesis on **Locke** pushes back against **Leo Strauss** and secular genealogies, instead aligning with a resurgent Protestant retrieval of **natural law** seen also in select **Reformed** voices. In public theology he engages **Oliver O'Donovan** on the transformation of Christendom, agreeing that gospel authority reconfigures political judgment while insisting on broader popular participation through civil society. He debates **Stanley Hauerwas** and the neo-Anabaptist critique of liberalism, affirming the church’s distinctiveness yet rejecting sectarianism by arguing for **principled pluralism** within liberal institutions.

Sociologically he converses with **James Davison Hunter** and the call to faithful presence, but he presses beyond cultural analysis to prescribe ecclesial practices that can sustain change over time. In American religious politics he appreciates **Neuhaus’s** warning against a naked public square while cautioning that civil religion must be humbled before the cross. Economically he draws on voices associated with the **Acton Institute** to articulate **economic wisdom** for congregations, yet he guards against baptizing markets by centering **neighbor-love** and **justice**. The result is a synthetic platform where **Reformed orthodoxy** on salvation powers a catholic retrieval of law, virtue, and institutional life.

#### 7. Doctrinal integration: creation to eschaton
Doctrinally Forster integrates **creation**, **fall**, **redemption**, and **consummation** into a social ethic. **Creation** establishes orders of life whose integrity must be honored; **fall** means that every sphere bears mixed motives and structural distortions; **redemption** in **union with Christ** awakens a people who love God and neighbor within those orders; and **eschatology** anchors the limits and hopes of political projects. He treats the **imago Dei** as both a grounding for rights and a summons to responsibility, **lex naturalis** as a creational grammar that public reason can approximate, and **covenant** as the divine architecture of salvation that then organizes the church as an alternative polis. The Spirit’s work in **sanctification** entails growth into vocations that bless outsiders, so that joy overflows not by conquest but by **witness**.

Forster’s ecclesiology is functional and formative. The church is the workshop in which **virtues** are crafted through Word and sacrament, and the sending base from which members enter business, education, law, and the arts to pursue **excellence** and **equity**. He is impatient with disincarnate moralism and instead promotes institutional imagination: start schools, reform practices, design products that serve. In all this he holds a tight Augustinian realism about sin that forbids social gnosticism. Yet he defends hope with **Kuyper’s** confidence in **common grace**, expecting that Christ’s lordship produces public goods even before the Parousia. The rhythm is neither triumphalist nor quietist, but a joyful realism for the long revolution of love.

#### 8. Influence, reception, and limits
Forster’s influence is disproportionate to the technicality of his prose because he writes in registers accessible to pastors, lay leaders, and policy interlocutors while remaining tethered to **Reformed** dogmatics. His books circulate in seminaries and networks concerned with **workfaith integration**, and his Locke scholarship contributes to the ongoing rehabilitation of a theologically serious **liberalism**. Evangelicals disillusioned with culture-war tactics have found in his **principled pluralism** and **public moral consensus** a way to remain civically engaged without sacrificing orthodoxy. At the same time his project sits at a crossroads of **Reformed** intramural debates over **natural law** and the **two kingdoms**. Some two-kingdom advocates applaud his restraint about ecclesial coercion but worry that his **Kuyperian** transformationalism risks confusing law and gospel, while Van Tillian presuppositionalists question his confidence in shared rational norms amid the **antithesis**.

Forster’s refusal to major on metaphysics leaves some classical theists desiring deeper rooting in **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, or **theologia** *ad intra* for the sake of doctrinal ballast. His reading of **Locke** has been contested by scholars who insist on an esoteric or secular Locke, warning that Protestantizing liberalism may understate modernity’s corrosive acids. Yet even critics concede that his historical reminder about the theological soil of Anglo-American institutions complicates declension narratives. Pastors have used **The Joy of Calvinism** to recover assurance and piety, while **Joy for the World** has seeded church-based initiatives on **vocation** and **economic wisdom**. The net effect is a body of work that calls the **Reformed** church to be doctrinally deep, publicly patient, and joyfully industrious.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classic **Reformed** and Westminster-oriented vantage point, Forster’s synthesis exhibits notable strengths and live tensions. He compellingly re-centers **divine love** and **union with Christ** in **Calvinist soteriology**, resisting caricatures of decretal coldness and rooting assurance in the covenantal faithfulness of the triune God. His advocacy of **vocation**, **common grace**, and **institutional pluralism** retrieves bona fide **Reformed** themes from **Calvin** to **Kuyper**, and his Augustinian cautions about political idolatry commend a salutary modesty. Yet questions arise at the level of epistemology and anthropology. A Westminster frame, especially in the line of **Van Til**, will ask whether Forster’s appeal to **public moral consensus** and **natural law** underestimates the **noetic effects of sin** and the principled **antithesis** between belief and unbelief in the interpretation of nature and reason. His embrace of a chastened **Lockean** liberalism may also import an implicit social contract individualism at odds with **covenant ontology**, in which corporate solidarity and federal headship define the basic grammar of human life. Furthermore, a two-kingdoms prudence would press for clearer law-gospel distinction and stronger differentiation between the church’s redemptive ministry and the civil realm’s provisional justice, lest **transformationalism** burden congregations with cultural tasks that eclipse Word and sacrament. A constructive alternative within **classical Reformed orthodoxy** would be to retain Forster’s vocational and joyful emphases while more explicitly grounding public engagement in **special revelation** as the ultimate norm for public reason, deploying **natural law** ministerially not magisterially, and framing liberal institutions within a pilgrim **eschatology** that privileges witness over management. Even so, Forster’s contribution remains a bracing call to let **grace create culture**, so that the joy of salvation resounds credibly in the world’s marketplaces and councils.
