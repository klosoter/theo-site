### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Thomas R. Schreiner, born in 1954 and long serving at **The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary**, emerged within an Evangelical world refashioned by the inerrancy conflict and the Reformed renewal in **soteriology**. His vocational center of gravity is **New Testament exegesis**, not speculative **systematic theology**, yet his work exerts broad doctrinal influence through careful readings of **Paul**, **Hebrews**, **Petrine epistles**, and **Revelation**. He is a churchman as well as a scholar, serving as pastor-elder at **Clifton Baptist Church**, and a translator and editor for the **Christian Standard Bible**. The matrix of his work is a convictional **Sola Scriptura**, which entails a historical-grammatical method, yet this method is ordered by a **canonical** and **salvation-historical** vision influenced by inaugurated **eschatology** and a doxological hermeneutic. He writes under the thesis that the New Testament magnifies **the glory of God in Christ**, a claim that structures both his **Pauline theology** and his larger **New Testament Theology**.

Schreiner’s epistemic stance is confessional yet irenic, characteristic of the broad **Evangelical** stream. He is not beholden to a single confessional tradition, though he often aligns with **Reformed** soteriological commitments such as **unconditional election**, **particular redemption**, and **perseverance of the saints**. His commitments are rendered in exegetical arguments, with Greek lexical and syntactic analysis serving comprehensive **biblical-theological** judgments. He resists reductionism, correcting both the older **Lutheran law-gospel** antithesis when it eclipses covenantal continuities and the **New Perspective** when it constricts **justification** to boundary markers and ecclesiology. In all, his method is inductive and canonical, wedded to a robust **redemptive-historical** storyline that runs from promise to **new covenant** fulfillment in the crucified and risen Christ.

#### 2. Early synthesis: law, covenant, and eschatology
With **The Law and Its Fulfillment** 1993, Schreiner offered a programmatic account of **Paul and the law** at the dawn of intense **New Perspective** debates. He affirmed that believers are not under the **Mosaic law** as covenant, since the law finds its eschatological telos in Christ, yet he insisted on a deep continuity in moral norms through the **law of Christ**. He argues that the Torah functioned as a temporary guardian until Christ and that in the era of the **Spirit** the demands of the law are fulfilled through **union with Christ** and the power of the **Spirit**. Against **E. P. Sanders** and **James D. G. Dunn**, he contested the thesis that Paul’s polemic targets only ethnic boundary markers by showing that **works of law** include moral demands when construed as a means of attaining righteousness before God. He thus defended an Augustinian and **Reformed** reading of **original sin** and human inability, while integrating **inaugurated eschatology** that locates ethical transformation in the new age of the **Spirit**.

This early work also seeded Schreiner’s treatment of **justification** and **sanctification** as distinct yet inseparable gifts of grace. He emphasizes forensic **justification** by **imputed righteousness** while insisting that **new creation** entails a new walk empowered by the **Spirit**. He favors the objective genitive reading of **pistis Christou** as faith in Christ, while acknowledging that the faithfulness of Christ is a vital theological theme elsewhere. The key is that salvation is by **grace** through **faith** apart from works, with the resultant obedience demonstrating the reality of union. This framing anticipates his later arguments about the **final judgment according to works**, a doctrine he will hold alongside **sola fide** without collapsing justification into transformation.

#### 3. Romans and Pauline theology: the glory of God and the righteousness of God
Schreiner’s **Romans** commentary in the Baker Exegetical series 1998, revised 2018, remains a signature contribution to **Pauline theology**. Two concerns structure his reading: the **righteousness of God** as God’s saving action that also reveals his covenant faithfulness, and the **glory of God** as the ultimate telos of redemption. He adjudicates the **dikaiosyne theou** debate by affirming that Paul speaks both of God’s righteous saving activity and the gift of righteousness credited to the believer, thus preserving both the **forensic** dimension and God’s **covenant** faithfulness. He defends penal **substitutionary atonement** and **propitiation** in Romans 3, over against reductionist narratival or apocalyptic readings. He treats Romans 5 to 8 as the heart of Pauline **union with Christ**, expounding the movement from solidarity in Adam to solidarity in Christ, and from condemnation to the life of the **Spirit**.

In his revised edition, Schreiner strengthens his critique of **apocalyptic** revisions of Paul such as **Douglas Campbell**, while incorporating the best of **John Barclay** on the incongruity of grace. He rejects **N. T. Wright’s** construal of **justification** as primarily an ecclesiology of belonging, contending that the Pauline courtroom is not dispensable and that entry into the community rests on a verdict rendered by God. On Romans 9 to 11, he argues for **unconditional election** and the future salvation of ethnic **Israel**, pushing back against supersessionist tendencies and maintaining a **salvation-historical** hope grounded in the irrevocable **covenants**. He also engages the **pistis Christou** debate and the shape of **sanctification**, consistently prioritizing exegesis of flow and discourse over dogmatic templates while landing in recognizably **Reformed** territory on core soteriological issues.

#### 4. A doxological center: Paul’s God and the New Testament’s unity
In **Paul, Apostle of God’s Glory in Christ** 2001 and **New Testament Theology: Magnifying God in Christ** 2008, Schreiner articulates the theological center of his corpus. The controlling axis is **the glory of God** manifested in the crucified and risen **Messiah**, which organizes the discrete theologies of **Gospels**, **Paul**, **General Epistles**, and **Revelation** into a unified **canonical** testimony. This is a method as much as a thesis. It permits him to trace themes such as the **kingdom of God**, the **new covenant**, the **Spirit**, **atonement**, and **mission** without losing textual specificity. The New Testament’s unity is not imposed but discovered along salvation-historical lines, so that multiple voices are heard within one divine discourse.

This doxological lens shapes his literary judgments as well. In **1 Peter** 2003 he underscores pilgrim identity and suffering as participation in **Christ’s** path to glory, tying **election**, **new birth**, and **holiness** to eschatological hope. In **Galatians** 2010 he maintains the classical reading of **justification by faith** over against **works of law**, resisting the boundary markers restriction by showing how the cross nullifies all boasting. Across these works, **union with Christ** functions as the matrix for benefits like **forgiveness**, **adoption**, and **sanctification**. The **glory of God** thus is not an abstract attribute but the radiance of God’s saving righteousness revealed in the narrative of **cross** and **resurrection**, received by **faith**, and displayed in the **church**’s transformed life.

#### 5. Justification, works, and final judgment
Schreiner’s **Faith Alone** 2015 in the Five Solas series is a direct engagement with **Roman Catholic** teaching from **Trent** through contemporary dialogues, as well as **New Perspective** and **Federal Vision** proposals. He defends **imputed righteousness** as the formal cause of justification, insists on the extrinsic and forensic nature of the verdict, and maintains that **good works** are the necessary fruit and evidence rather than any part of the ground or instrument. On the contested theme of the **final judgment according to works**, he argues that Paul’s judgment texts affirm a public vindication that accords with works, while justification itself is by **faith alone**. This is not a dilution of **sola fide** but a biblical account of how **sanctification** evidences **union with Christ**.

In engaging **N. T. Wright** and **James D. G. Dunn**, Schreiner grants the ecclesial implications of justification while rejecting any reduction of the doctrine to boundary status. He contends that a robust covenantal reading must also reckon with the plight of sin and the divine wrath and with the necessity of a **penal substitution** that satisfies justice. His approach is sympathetic to the best insights of **Richard Hays** on intertextuality but resists readings that marginalize the legal and forensic metaphors. The outcome is a nuanced yet firm retrieval of **Reformation** teaching on **justification**, with exegetical care over key terms such as **dikaioun**, **pistis**, and **ergon nomou**.

#### 6. Perseverance, warning, and assurance
In **Run to Win the Prize** 2010 and the **Hebrews** volume in the Biblical Theology for Christian Proclamation series 2015, Schreiner develops a pastoral soteriology of **perseverance** that treats the warning passages as God-ordained means for the elect. He articulates a compatibilist model in which divine **sovereignty** and human responsibility both hold, aligning with historic **perseverance of the saints** while avoiding a reduction to fatalism. **Hebrews** provides his richest account of the **new covenant**, the **once-for-all sacrifice**, the superior **priesthood**, and the church’s pilgrim endurance as it awaits the consummation. Assurance is real and grounded in **Christ’s** work, yet the covenant community must heed warnings that expose false assurance and stimulate persevering faith.

This pastoral note extends to ecclesial ethics and practice. In the co-edited **Women in the Church** first released 1995 and revised 2016, and in broader essays on **complementarianism**, Schreiner defends male eldership and the integrity of **1 Timothy 2**, while encouraging full use of women’s gifts consistent with **canonical** order. In **Believer’s Baptism** 2007 he argues that baptism is the **new covenant** sign for the regenerate, tied to **union with Christ** in Romans 6 and Galatians 3, rejecting any sacramental ex opere operato efficacy. He has written on **spiritual gifts** in 2018, moving from strict **cessationism** to a cautious affirmation that some gifts continue under the lordship of **Scripture**, while holding that foundational **apostleship** and inscripturating **prophecy** have ceased. These positions showcase a coherent Baptist ecclesiology grounded in **Scripture**, an ethic of order, and a missional focus.

#### 7. Canonical theology and translation labors
Schreiner’s **The King in His Beauty** 2013 is a whole-Bible **biblical theology** that reads both **Old Testament** and **New Testament** through the lens of the **kingdom of God** and the **glory of the cross**. He traces covenantal progression from creation through **Abraham**, **Sinai**, **David**, exile, and **new covenant** fulfillment, elucidating typology without collapsing the testaments. In **Covenant and God’s Purpose for the World** 2017 and **The Kingdom of God and the Glory of the Cross** 2018 he gives concise expositions of a **progressive covenantalism** that rejects both classical **dispensationalism** and traditional **covenant theology**, locating the law’s fulfillment and the people of God’s unity in **Christ**. His **The Joy of Hearing** 2021 in the NSBT series offers a theology of **Revelation** focused on faithful witness and the victory of the Lamb, integrating **apocalyptic** imagery into a pastoral summons.

Alongside writing, Schreiner has stewarded the text of Scripture in service of the church. As New Testament editor for the **Christian Standard Bible** released 2017, he oversaw translation choices that balance **formal equivalence** and clarity. This work displays the same commitments that govern his exegesis, including sensitivity to discourse, intertextual echoes, and the theological freight of key terms such as **dikaiosyne**, **charis**, and **pneuma**. Throughout, his contributions reflect a scholar who holds together the academy and the church, with **biblical theology** constantly feeding **systematic** reflection and pastoral proclamation.

#### 8. Debates, interlocutors, and influence
Schreiner’s career unfolds in dialogue with significant twentieth and twenty-first century figures. He disputes **E. P. Sanders** on covenantal nomism as a sufficient description of **Second Temple Judaism**, since Paul’s polemic still targets reliance on **works** in any form. He engages **James D. G. Dunn** and **N. T. Wright** over **justification**, conceding the importance of ecclesial incorporation while maintaining the priority of the **forensic** act of God. He contests **Douglas Campbell’s** anti-forensic reconstruction with close **Romans** exegesis and draws on **John Barclay’s** gift discourse to enrich accounts of **grace**. He benefits from colleagues such as **D. A. Carson** and **Douglas Moo**, and he has helped shape a generation of **Evangelical** pastors through teaching at **Southern Seminary** and through his accessibility as a writer.

His influence is felt in discussions of **law and gospel**, **covenant theology**, **sanctification**, and **mission**. Within broader **Evangelicalism**, he is a bridge between academic and pastoral worlds, evidenced by his careful commentaries and his practical volumes on **spiritual gifts** and **church leadership**. The pattern is consistent. Careful exegesis yields a salvation-historical synthesis ordered to **the glory of God in Christ**. That synthesis then feeds doctrinal retrieval of **justification**, **atonement**, and **perseverance** and shapes ecclesial practice in **baptism**, **gender**, and **worship**. This integrative posture explains his wide reception among Baptists, Presbyterians, and non-denominational churches that share commitments to **sola Scriptura** and the **gospel of grace**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage point, Schreiner’s corpus is a rich ally on the **material principle** of the Reformation and on the **gospel**. His defense of **justification by faith alone**, **imputed righteousness**, **penal substitutionary atonement**, **unconditional election**, and **perseverance through means** stands squarely with confessional **orthodoxy**. His insistence that the **final judgment according to works** is evidentiary rather than meritorious fits the Reformed distinction between the **instrument** of justification and the **fruit** of sanctification, though some may prefer clearer covenantal categories linking this to **union with Christ** and the **ordo salutis**. The chief tensions lie in **covenant theology**. His **progressive covenantalism** rejects a formal **covenant of works** and modifies the threefold unity that structures **Westminster** federalism. That move enables a robust new covenant focus and a strong doctrine of **law fulfillment**, yet it complicates continuity claims about the **moral law**, including fourth commandment **Sabbath** practice, where Westminster would uphold abiding obligation while Schreiner tends to see a transformed Lord’s Day pattern without legal imposition. His **credobaptist** ecclesiology, coupled with a spiritual rather than sacramental account of **baptism**, diverges from Reformed confessional teaching on **covenant children** and the church as mixed body. His nuanced stance on **spiritual gifts**, open to some contemporary manifestations while insisting that Scripture norm them, also sits uneasily beside strict **cessationism** held by some in the tradition, though it remains bounded by **Sola Scriptura**. In principle, the Reformed alternative would commend a classical **covenant of works and grace** schema, infant **baptism** as covenant sign and means, and a stronger doctrine of the abiding **moral law**, while welcoming Schreiner’s doxological center, his careful **Romans** exegesis, and his clear proclamation of the **gospel of grace** as shared core commitments.
