### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and program
The ministry of **Andrew S. Farley** arises from a late-modern evangelical world unsettled by performance-oriented spirituality and repetitive cycles of guilt. As a pastor in Texas and radio host of **The Grace Message**, Farley addresses a broad audience that has grown weary of moralism yet remains hungry for **assurance** and **union with Christ**. His unusual formation as a university professor in **applied linguistics** and second language acquisition sharpened his attention to textual **grammar**, **discourse context**, and semantic nuance. This analytic habit informs his refrains about reading **Hebrews**, **Romans**, and **Galatians** on their own covenantal terms. He opposes what he calls theology of mixture, a fusion of **Law and Gospel** that produces chronic spiritual anxiety. Against this he proposes a single thesis that commands his project: under the **New Covenant**, believers are fully forgiven, truly new at the core, and free from the **Mosaic Law** as a rule of life, living instead from the indwelling **Christ** and the **Spirit**.

Methodologically, **Farley** presents a self-consciously **biblicist** program. He embraces the grammatical-historical method, trading in brief Greek glosses like *sarx* for flesh and *hamartia* for sin as a power, and he repeats a pastoral axiom that **context** cures misinterpretation. His approach is canonical yet decisively **covenantal**, with a bright red line between **Old Covenant law** and **New Covenant grace**. He insists the New Covenant begins at the **cross and resurrection**, not at the birth of Jesus. Consequently some hard sayings of **Jesus** are interpreted as intensifications of **Law** designed to drive hearers to grace rather than as direct Christian ethics. The method is not a historical-critical reconstruction but an evangelical **grammatical and covenantal** reading that prioritizes **assurance**, **identity**, and the efficacy of the cross.

#### 2. Works and thematic development
The breakthrough book **The Naked Gospel** 2009 introduces Farleys central claims with a provoking subtitle about truths seldom heard in church. It narrates a conversion from religious striving to the **finished work of Christ**, pressing texts like **Hebrews 10.10–18** on once-for-all forgiveness and **Romans 6–8** on death to sin and the Law. The follow-up **God Without Religion** 2011 argues that biblical Christianity is simpler than institutional religion allows, contending for **freedom from the Law**, **new identity**, and the futility of rule-based righteousness. With **Operation Screwtape** 2012, Farley uses satirical spiritual-warfare letters to expose lies about **condemnation** and **self-improvement**, advancing his theme that the **accuser** traffics in half-true Law.

Next, **Heaven Is Now** 2013 and **Relaxing with God** 2014 stress **union with Christ**, **rest**, and the immediacy of divine presence, reframing spiritual disciplines as expressions of **freedom** rather than techniques for earning divine favor. **Twisted Scripture** 2019 systematizes his exegesis by addressing forty-five contested texts, including **1 John 1.9**, **Matthew 6.12**, and **James 2**, with the aim of untangling what he deems legalistic misreadings. **The Grace Message** 2022 recapitulates the corpus and consolidates his broadcast catechesis: believers are **clean and close**, not dirty and distant; Christian life is learning to walk by the **Spirit** from a new core, not climbing a moral ladder by **Law**. Across these works, the constant melody is **New Covenant grace** without mixture, combined with a robust assurance grounded in the **cross** and **resurrection**.

#### 3. The New Covenant and the Law
At the heart of **Farleys** system lies a high-contrast doctrine of the **New Covenant**. He reads **Jeremiah 31**, **Hebrews 8–10**, and **2 Corinthians 3** as teaching that the **Mosaic Law** has been rendered obsolete as a covenantal administration and as a rule of life. Christians are dead to the **Law** through the body of **Christ** per **Romans 7**, not under the **Ten Commandments** as a binding code, and instead under the **law of the Spirit of life** and the **new command** to love as an outflow of union. The Sermon on the Mount is treated as an intensification of **Law** to show sin to be utterly sinful, with commands like gouging out eyes serving a diagnostic rather than prescriptive function. That diagnostic aim is aligned with Pauls description of the **Law** as a ministry of death and condemnation in **2 Corinthians 3**.

This stance extends to ethics of stewardship and worship. **Farley** rejects **tithing** as a New Covenant requirement, replacing it with cheerful and willing giving by the **Spirit**. He repudiates **Sabbath** obligation and ritual laws as fulfilled in **Christ**, cautioning against importing them as Christian identity markers. He champions the **freedom of conscience** in disputable matters, arguing that external codes cannot produce **fruit of the Spirit**. The sharp discontinuity functions as an assurance engine: if Christians are not under **Law**, then condemnation has no covenantal foothold, so the conscience rests in **Christ** who is the end of the **Law** for righteousness to everyone who believes.

#### 4. Forgiveness, confession, and assurance
The doctrine of **once-for-all forgiveness** is Farleys pastoral center of gravity. He repeatedly expounds **Hebrews 10.10–18** to claim that every sin Christians will ever commit was fully dealt with at the cross, and that **God remembers sins no more**. Therefore there is no need for ongoing ritual confession to secure incremental forgiveness. His controversial exegesis of **1 John 1.9** asserts that John first addresses sin-denying opponents and invites them to agree with God about sin so as to be forgiven and cleansed once for all. On this reading, believers are not toggling between forgiven and unforgiven statuses. Similarly, the petition forgive us our sins in the **Lords Prayer** is classified as pre-cross and Old Covenant, not the normative grammar of post-resurrection assurance.

From this flows an ethic of **confession** and **repentance** as relational honesty rather than leverage for pardon. Confession is agreeing with God, not eliciting judicial cleansing. Repentance is a **change of mind** anchored in new identity, not a meritorious sorrow. Farley argues that habitual guilt management keeps Christians preoccupied with self rather than **Christ**. He emphasizes **no condemnation** in **Romans 8.1**, pastoral confidence in **Hebrews 4** access, and a conscience trained by **grace** rather than by fear of covenantal penalties. The aim is a settled and resilient assurance, free from what he views as religious neuroticism.

#### 5. Anthropology, sanctification, and spiritual conflict
The anthropology of **Andrew Farley** breaks with common evangelical talk of a believers two natures. He insists there is not an old and a new self cohabiting the heart. Instead the believer possesses a single **new heart** and **new spirit** united to **Christ**. The enemy is not a resident sinful nature but the power of **sin** as **hamartia** and the patterns of the **flesh** as *sarx*. He leverages **Romans 6** to affirm that the old self was crucified, believers are dead to sin and alive to God, and thus daily exhortations to die to self misapply the cross. Christian growth is learning to say no to **fleshly** mindsets from a place of true newness, not attempting to improve a hybrid nature.

Sanctification is thus framed as definitive and expressive. Believers are sanctified once for all per **Hebrews 10.10**, and they progressively **renew the mind** and display the **fruit of the Spirit**. He resists the language of climbing toward holiness by rule-keeping, contending instead for **identity-based obedience** that arises from **union with Christ** and the indwelling **Spirit**. Spiritual warfare is primarily a battle over **belief** and **identity**, not a struggle for cleansing. Where others might stress **simul iustus et peccator**, Farley underscores genuine newness and unbroken fellowship, redefining struggle as learning to walk by the **Spirit** rather than toggling between righteousness and distance.

#### 6. Church, sacraments, and practice
Ecclesiologically, **Farley** leads a congregation known as **Church Without Religion** and broadcasts widely through **The Grace Message**, shaping a lay catechesis centered on **assurance** and **freedom**. He treats **baptism** and the **Lords Supper** as New Covenant celebrations that proclaim union and forgiveness already accomplished, not sacramental pipelines that condition ongoing pardon. The **Supper** is remembrance and proclamation rather than a means of post-baptismal cleansing. Giving is grace-motivated generosity, not **tithing** obligation; spiritual disciplines are opportunities for **rest** and **communion**, not technologies for merit or for maintaining proximity to God.

Pastoral practice follows the same template. Counseling emphasizes **identity in Christ**, dismantling shame-driven narratives, and cultivating **faith working through love**. Accountability is reframed as encouragement in **newness of life** rather than surveillance under **Law**. Instruction in **Hebrews**, **Romans**, and **Galatians** anchors catechesis. The ministry is strongly evangelistic, calling unbelievers into the **New Covenant** by grace through faith, while calling believers into the relief of **no condemnation** and the dignity of sharing in **Christs** life.

#### 7. Interlocutors, debates, and boundaries
Theologically, **Farley** stands near currents of **New Covenant Theology** and **Free Grace** soteriology, while distinguishing himself from prosperity or therapeutic versions of **grace**. He contests **Lordship Salvation** readings that locate assurance in evidentiary perseverance, charging that such schemas smuggle **Law** into the **Gospel**. He disputes charges of **antinomianism**, answering with **Titus 2** that grace teaches us to say no to ungodliness, and with **Galatians 5** that the **Spirit** produces love that fulfills the righteous requirement apart from **Law**. His polemics often target respected proof texts. He re-reads **James 2** as warning against dead faith that lacks **Spirit-born** life rather than as a metric for incremental justification. He rejects traditional appeals to **1 John 1.9** as the Christians bar of soap, and he reclassifies **Matthew 5–7** as pre-cross **Law** magnified.

Critics from **Reformed**, **Lutheran**, and **Wesleyan** streams press him on boundaries. Some argue that his discontinuity minimizes the **third use of the Law** and domesticates the Sermon on the Mount as mere accelerator of guilt. Others object that his denial of ongoing confession as instrumentally related to **paternal forgiveness** misreads **1 John**, which repeatedly addresses a believing community. In reply, Farley doubles down on **Hebrews** finality and on **Romans 7** death to the **Law**, claiming that only unalloyed **New Covenant grace** can sustain holiness without fear.

#### 8. Exegetical distinctives and pastoral payoffs
Several exegetical moves define **Farleys** originality. His covenantal timing places the **New Covenant** after the cross, reframing **Jesus** ministry as largely preparatory. His lexical stress on *sarx* and *hamartia* presents sin as a parasite and the flesh as a strategy rather than as a resident nature, enabling robust talk of a **new heart**. His reading of **Hebrews 10** as the hermeneutical key to every question about forgiveness reduces a wide array of pastoral anxieties. And his deployment of **Romans 8.1** as assurance axiom leaves little room for a spirituality of distance. The pastoral payoff is a congregation that sings of being **clean and close**, prays with confidence, gives from freedom, and resists anxiety-driven religion.

The risks are evident too. A hard **Law–Gospel** partition may turn complex teachings into simple binaries. Biblical commands addressed to believers can be read as mere diagnostic law rather than formative moral vision. By relieving consciences, Farley galvanizes some to healthy **freedom**; by truncating older patterns of **confession** and **discipline**, he may starve the church of time-tested practices of **repentance**. Still, his homiletical clarity and relentless centering on **union with Christ** constitute a recognizable contribution within contemporary **evangelical** theology.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** standpoint, **Andrew Farleys** achievement is a bracing retrieval of **assurance**, **union with Christ**, and the finality of **Christus consummator** in **Hebrews**. Yet his architecture generates principial tensions with classical **covenant theology**. First, his dismissal of the **third use of the Law** contradicts the confessional claim that the moral law, while not a covenant of works, remains a **rule of life** that Christ writes on the heart. The **Law–Gospel** relation in Reformed thought is not competing economies but a redemptive administration in which **lex** drives to **evangelium** and then guides the grateful. Second, his reading of **1 John 1.9** undercuts the ordinary means of **repentance** and **confession** as filial, not forensic, gifts; the **Lords Prayer** is received by the Reformed not as pre-cross obsolescence but as the enduring grammar of adopted children seeking daily pardon within the covenant of **grace**. Third, his near-rejection of **simul iustus et peccator** risks an underestimation of indwelling sin and of the churches need for ongoing mortification and vivification. A constructive alternative would keep his insistence on definitive sanctification and full pardon while restoring the **moral law** as gracious guide, weekly **Word and sacrament** as instruments of growth, and ongoing **confession** as the Spirit’s pathway to deeper communion. On revelation, covenant, and grace, classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would retain Farleys big gospel while repairing his discontinuities to preserve the churchs historical wisdom.
