### TITLE
Evangelical ressourcement: retrieving classical trinitarian dogmatics for Scripture-shaped ecclesial renewal.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Contemporary evangelical milieu** shaped by the late twentieth-century **trinitarian renaissance**, post-Barth debates, and Anglican-Reformed British theology engaging **patristic ressourcement** and **postliberal hermeneutics**.
- **Methodological posture**: canonical-linguistic and dogmatic exegesis under **Scripture’s primacy**, with constructive use of **patristic perichoresis**, **economic-immanent Trinity** rules, and a church-facing **theological ontology of communion**.
- **Key works and years**: publicly circulated essays and monograph-length studies in the 2000s–2010s on the **Trinity**, **Christology**, and **ecclesiology**; thematic focus rather than a single landmark tome; the profile synthesizes his published and taught corpus as received in evangelical forums across those years.
- **Central terms**: **perichoresis**, **missio Dei**, **analogia fidei**, **participatory ontology**, **theodramatic Scripture**, **creedal rule of faith**, **economy-immanent distinction**, **narrative ontology**, **sacramental realism**.
- **Primary interlocutors**: **Athanasius**, **Cappadocians**, **Augustine**; moderns such as **Karl Barth**, **Colin Gunton**, **John Zizioulas**, **Robert Jenson**, **T. F. Torrance**, and evangelical hermeneuticians like **Kevin Vanhoozer**.
- **Reformed reception cue**: strengths in **trinitarian orthodoxy** and **christological clarity**; questions around **divine simplicity** and **impassibility** vis-a-vis relational metaphysics; generally amenable to **Westminster** confessional commitments with targeted cautions.

### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
G. Michael Thomas emerges within the contemporary evangelical scene shaped by the **late twentieth-century trinitarian revival**, reading **Athanasius**, the **Cappadocians**, and **Augustine** alongside **Karl Barth** and second-generation British theology after **Colin Gunton**. His formation coheres with institutions where **creedal orthodoxy** and **biblical authority** remain mutually implicative rather than adversarial, and this yields a method that intertwines **canonical exegesis** with **dogmatic judgment**. Thomas positions the church’s confession as a **regula fidei** that tutors interpretation, yet he insists on **Scripture’s primacy** as the principium cognoscendi, using the Reformed grammar of **sola Scriptura** and **analogia fidei** to discipline constructive proposals. His intellectual setting includes critical engagement with **postliberal narrative theology**, **theological hermeneutics** in the wake of **Kevin Vanhoozer**, and the ressourcement retrieval of **perichoresis** and **communion** articulated by **John Zizioulas** and **Robert Jenson**, all filtered through an evangelical concern for mission and catechesis.

Methodologically Thomas’s approach is best described as **evangelical ressourcement**. He reads Scripture within the economy of **missio Dei** and the christological center of the **homoousios**, arguing that the **economic missions** of Son and Spirit disclose the fitness of the **immanent processions** without collapsing the **economy-immanent distinction**. Against the background of modern skepticism toward metaphysics, he argues for a modest **theological ontology** ordered by the givenness of the gospel, deriving conceptual warrants from Scripture’s own **doctrinal patterns** and from the **ecumenical creeds**. This results in a style of theology that speaks in the church’s idiom, returning repeatedly to **Athanasius’s soteriological axiom** what is not assumed is not healed, and to **Augustine’s rule** opera Trinitatis ad extra sunt indivisa, while maintaining evangelical commitments to **conversion**, **proclamation**, and **discipleship**.

#### 2. The doctrine of God: Trinity and attributes
The heart of Thomas’s constructive work lies in **trinitarian dogmatics**. He affirms with the Nicene and Constantinopolitan creeds the **consubstantiality** of the Son and Spirit with the Father, deploying **perichoresis** to express the coinherent relations and to resist both modalism and tritheism. With **Barth**, he stresses that God is who he is in the act of **self-revelation** in Jesus Christ, yet he refuses a purely revelational account of deity by reasserting **aseity** and **immutability** as the grammar in which **God’s love** and **mercy** become intelligible. In the contemporary dispute about how the **economy** relates to the **immanent Trinity**, he follows a careful **propriety rule**: the economy truly reveals the triune life, but not exhaustively or univocally, appealing to an **analogia fidei** rather than an **analogia entis** to secure the Creator-creature distinction while safeguarding the evangelical confidence that the Father is known in the Son by the Spirit.

On **divine attributes**, Thomas retrieves **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability** as confessional affirmations ordered to the gospel, not as metaphysical residues. He aligns with **T. F. Torrance** in emphasizing that these attributes are christologically reframed, so that **impassibility** means the unfrustratable fidelity of God’s triune love rather than apathy. He resists tendencies toward **eternal functional subordination**, arguing instead that the missions presuppose, and do not ground, the **personal relations of origin**: the Father begets, the Son is begotten, the Spirit proceeds. By making **perichoresis** the principal idiom for divine unity and distinction, Thomas intends to show that **God’s unity** is not a bare monadic oneness but the unity of communion, thereby giving evangelical ecclesiology and spirituality a **trinitarian ontology**.

#### 3. Christology and soteriology
Thomas’s **christology** follows the Chalcedonian pattern of one person in two natures, fully divine and fully human, with robust attention to **anhypostasia–enhypostasia** to constrain speculative flights. He presses an **evangelical soteriology** that integrates **substitutionary atonement** within a larger patristic narrative of **incarnational participation**, charting how the crucified and risen Son recapitulates humanity and repairs the **Adam-Christ** analogy. Central is the confession of **Calvary** as the locus of **penal representation** and **victory over the powers**, held together through the logic of **communicatio operationum** where the person acts according to either nature in the unity of the subject. This yields a doctrine of salvation that is both juridical and medicinal: the believer is justified by **imputed righteousness** and sanctified by **Spirit-wrought participation** in Christ.

Against modern fragmentation, he ties **atonement** to **Trinity** and **incarnation**. The cross is not a divine-human negotiation but the self-offering of the **homoousios Son** to the **Father** in the Spirit. Thomas follows **Athanasius** in insisting that only God saves, so the efficacy of the cross requires **theopaschite grammar** carefully construed: one of the Trinity suffered *secundum humanitatem* without compromising **impassibility** *ad intra*. Evangelical piety is thereby located within the **vicarious humanity** of Christ, so that assurance and obedience alike are anchored in the **federal headship** of the second Adam.

#### 4. Scripture, canon, and theological interpretation
In hermeneutics Thomas is a committed advocate of **theological interpretation of Scripture** under the **creedal rule of faith**. He treats **canon** as the Spirit-shaped field within which the triune God speaks, drawing on **Vanhoozer’s** canonical-linguistic model to claim that doctrine renders the **illocutionary force** of the divine speech-act. Yet the decisive norm is **Scripture’s self-attesting witness**, a classically Reformed motif traceable to **Calvin’s** doctrine of the **Spirit’s internal testimony**. Accordingly, he commends figural reading that honors **literal sense** and **canonical context** while resisting allegorical license. The **Old Testament** is the indispensable part of the Christian canon that, in the economy of **promise and fulfillment**, witnesses to Christ in its own idiom through types, patterns, and covenantal structures.

Thomas’s bibliology refuses to isolate **inerrancy** from ecclesial use. **Inerrancy** is confessed as a way of saying that Scripture is wholly trustworthy for its divinely intended purposes. He aligns evangelical confidence in the text with **patristic exegesis**, arguing that figural readings of **exodus**, **exile**, and **wisdom** do not compete with historical inquiry but seek the **res** to which the textual economy points. The result is a hermeneutic suitable for catechesis, preaching, and sacramental formation: the **Word** shapes a people into the image of the **Son** through the **Spirit** in the life of the **church**.

#### 5. Ecclesiology and sacramental theology
A hallmark of Thomas’s ecclesiology is the insistence that **communion** is not a sociological construct but a **trinitarian participation**. Drawing on **Zizioulas’s** account of personhood as being-in-communion, he adapts it for evangelical contexts by grounding **ecclesial identity** in the gospel’s **covenantal promise** and the **means of grace**. The church is the community called by the **Word** and formed by **Baptism** and **Eucharist** into the **missio Dei**. He argues for a chastened **sacramental realism** that resists both bare memorialism and transmutation schemes, articulating **real participation** in Christ by the Spirit through the ordained signs, consonant with Reformed accounts of **spiritual presence** in the Supper and **covenantal incorporation** in Baptism.

This ecclesial vision extends to the church’s practices. **Catechesis**, **discipline**, and **diaconal care** are not auxiliaries but the embodied shape of **sanctification**. The **fivefold ministry** language of some charismatic streams is received critically; Thomas reasserts **ministry of Word and sacrament** as primary while welcoming the **charismata** as ordered gifts for edification. Unity and holiness are interpreted doxologically: the church’s **koinonia** reflects the **perichoretic** peace of the triune God, and its **mission** is an extension of the Son’s sending by the Father in the **Spirit**.

#### 6. Creation, providence, and culture
Thomas situates **creation** and **providence** within the **triune economy**. Creation is an act of **free love** by the triune God, not an emanation, and is ordered toward **Sabbath rest** and **eschatological communion**. He retrieves **providence** as both **concurrence** and **special care**, thereby steering between deism and occasionalism. The **imago Dei** is framed christologically and ecclesially, with **Christ the image** as archetype and the **church** as the sphere of renewed imaging by the **Spirit**. This leads to a robust theology of culture that is neither withdrawal nor triumphalism but **pilgrim engagement**, honoring creaturely **goods** while discerning **idolatry** through cruciform wisdom.

On science and society, Thomas advocates a posture of **critical realism** grounded in **creaturely participation**. Because all truth is God’s truth, Christians can receive insights from the sciences while refusing metaphysical naturalism. The **cultural mandate** is coordinated with the **Great Commission**, and common grace is acknowledged as a Reformed grammar that permits civic cooperation without confusing the **two kingdoms** or conflating **church** and **world**. The result is a theology that encourages intellectual humility, social responsibility, and liturgical depth.

#### 7. Pneumatology, sanctification, and mission
Thomas’s **pneumatology** is decisively **christological** and **ecclesial**. The **Holy Spirit** is the Spirit of the crucified and risen **Son**, proceeding from the **Father** and resting upon the church to conform it to Christ. He resists impersonal accounts of the Spirit’s work by emphasizing **personal agency**, **gift**, and **indwelling**. The Spirit unites believers to Christ, applies the benefits of redemption, and equips the church for **witness** through diverse **charisms** ordered to love. **Sanctification** is both definitive and progressive, grounded in union with Christ and communicated through **Word and sacrament** within a communal form of life.

Mission is narrated as participation in the **missio Dei**. Evangelism is the Spirit’s opening of hearts to the **gospel**, not a technique, and social action is an implication of **kingdom** ethics rather than its substitute. Thomas frames mission within **eschatology**, where the church lives between the **already** and the **not yet**, bearing witness to the reign of the **triune God**. This eschatological reserve keeps the church hopeful without utopianism and penitent without despair.

#### 8. Doctrinal development and ecumenical posture
A notable feature of Thomas’s work is a nuanced account of **doctrinal development** anchored in **Scripture’s sufficiency**. He distinguishes between **revealed truth** and its **dogmatic articulation**, allowing for growth in clarity without alteration in substance. The **creeds** function as faithful, though secondary, norms for reading and confessing the gospel. Ecumenically he navigates between **catholic** aspiration and **evangelical** identity, recognizing the gifts of diverse traditions while testing all things by the **canonical witness**. He exhibits sympathy with **torrancean** science-theology dialogue and with **Jenson’s** narrative ontology, yet he reins in speculative tendencies by recurring to **confessional boundaries** and the **Westminster** and **Reformed** standards on God and salvation.

This posture yields a responsible catholicity. He is open to learning from **Orthodox** accounts of **theosis** but translates them into **Reformed** idioms of **union with Christ**. He engages **Roman Catholic** ressourcement appreciatively regarding **sacramental signification**, while rejecting sacerdotal excesses by reaffirming the **once-for-all** priesthood of **Christ**. With **Lutheran** interlocutors he shares a high doctrine of the **Word** and **justification**, careful to maintain the **extra Calvinisticum** to protect the Creator-creature distinction in the incarnation.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed/WTS** vantage, Thomas’s contributions are salutary and mostly aligned with **classical orthodoxy**. His **trinitarian dogmatics**, emphasis on **perichoresis**, and rejection of **eternal functional subordination** cohere with the **Nicene** and **Reformed** grammar of **autotheos** and the **indivisa opera**. His **christology** is Chalcedonian with appropriate use of **anhypostasia–enhypostasia**, and his **soteriology** integrates **penal substitution** with **participation** in a manner that honors both **justification by faith** and **union with Christ**. His **bibliology** affirms **inerrancy** within a robust canonical practice that the **Westminster Confession** would welcome. Cautions arise where a communion-focused **trinitarian ontology** might, if untethered, pressure **divine simplicity**, **impassibility**, and **immutability** into relational categories that dilute their classical force. The Reformed corrective is not to reject communion language but to insist that **simplicity** grounds communion, that **impassibility** names the steadfastness of triune love *ad intra*, and that the **economy-immanent distinction** be maintained so that revelational language does not exhaustively define God’s inner life. On **sacramental realism**, his moderate Reformed view is sound, though vigilance is needed to prevent any slide from **spiritual presence** to quasi-localization. In sum, Thomas’s evangelical ressourcement advances constructive dogmatics that can be gladly received within **Westminster** horizons, provided the classical attributes remain regulative for relational idioms and the **covenantal** economy continues to norm the metaphysical grammar.
