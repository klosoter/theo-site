### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and the wager of method
Nancey Murphy emerges as a leading voice in **contemporary philosophical theology** shaped by late twentieth-century debates over **science and religion**, **foundationalism**, and the status of **theological rationality**. Trained in **philosophy of science** and **theology** in the Berkeley and Graduate Theological Union orbit, and serving at **Fuller Theological Seminary**, she absorbed the legacies of **Thomas Kuhn’s paradigms**, **Imre Lakatos’s research programmes**, and **Bas van Fraassen’s constructive empiricism** while engaging evangelical and Anabaptist ecclesial concerns. Her career from the 1990s forward is marked by a double wager: that theology can be both publicly rational without modern **foundationalism**, and integrally conversant with the best **neuroscience**, **cosmology**, and **complexity theory** without capitulating to **reductive naturalism**. The resulting program brings together a Lakatosian picture of theological knowledge, **nonreductive physicalism** in anthropology, and a **kenotic ethic** of divine action attuned to complex causal hierarchies.

The early context is decisive. The post-1960s reconsideration of scientific rationality in the wake of **Kuhn** and **Quine**, combined with internal evangelical debates over **inerrancy** and the influence of **Reformed epistemology** from **Alvin Plantinga** and **Nicholas Wolterstorff**, created a contested field. Murphy’s debut volume, **Theology in the Age of Scientific Reasoning** 1990, attempts to map a specifically theological way forward that neither returns to **Cartesian foundationalism** nor embraces an anything-goes **relativism**. The book positions systematic theology as a disciplined inquiry with a **hard core** of central Christian convictions and a **protective belt** of revisable theories, in deliberate conversation with **Lakatos**.

#### 2. Postfoundational theology as a research programme
The heart of Murphy’s methodological proposal is a **Lakatosian account of theology**. The **hard core** includes credal claims such as the **Trinity**, **incarnation**, and **resurrection**, while doctrinal models and ethical applications form the **protective belt** that absorbs anomalies and is open to refinement. Theology advances, on this view, as a **progressive research programme** when it generates novel hypotheses, unifies disparate data from **Scripture**, **tradition**, and **empirical disciplines**, and resolves explanatory tensions more fruitfully than rival approaches. Criteria of evaluation are public but tradition-situated, a blend of **critical realism**, **virtue epistemology**, and **communal practices** that discipline inquiry without imposing Enlightenment **foundationalist** canons.

Murphy’s **Anglo-American Postmodernity** 1997 elaborates this stance by distinguishing Anglo-American forms of postmodern critique from French deconstruction, highlighting the roles of **virtues of inquiry**, **communitarian rationality** drawn from **Alasdair MacIntyre**, and **Wittgensteinian** attention to language-games. Theology is portrayed as rigorous argument within a form of life, accountable to both the **Scriptural canon** and empirical findings. Against strong **Plantingan** Reformed epistemology, she resists the appeal to a wholly independent **sensus divinitatis** as warrant, preferring **traditioned coherence**, empirical fertility, and problem-solving capacity. Against **van Fraassen’s** antirealism, she claims a thin **critical realism** that allows talk of truth while keeping models revisable. The net effect is a postfoundational confession of truth that remains corrigible, a stance she regards as faithful to the **pilgrim church** and suitable for dialogue with the sciences.

#### 3. The science-and-religion interface: beyond Barbour’s typologies
Murphy’s work inhabits and critiques the classic **Ian Barbour** typologies of science-religion relations. She rejects both **conflict** and naive **concordism**, advocating instead a relational stance integrating theological **research programmes** with the **methodological naturalism** of the sciences. In her essays and collaborations, especially within the **CTNS Divine Action Project**, she contests interventionist models of **divine action** that posit violations of natural law, opting for a **kenotic**, noninterventionist account mediated by complex **hierarchies of causation**. The divine will is expressed through **top-down causation** and constraint-like processes that organize lower-level dynamics, a proposal compatible with both **quantum indeterminacy** and **complexity theory**.

This approach is mediated through constructive work with **George F. R. Ellis** in **On the Moral Nature of the Universe** 1996. There they argue for a cosmos whose deepest moral signature is **kenosis**, as seen paradigmatically in the **Christ event** and analogically in the self-limitation of higher-level structures that enable lower-level flourishing. The language of **emergence**, **levels of organization**, and **downward causation** functions here not as metaphysical dualism but as an account of causal plurality. Their theological wager is that **kenotic love** is both the ethic of God and the grain of the universe.

#### 4. Anthropology: Nonreductive physicalism and spirited bodies
Murphy is best known theologically for defending **nonreductive physicalism** and critiquing **substance dualism**. In **Whatever Happened to the Soul?** 1998, co-edited with **Warren S. Brown** and **H. Newton Malony**, she gathers neuroscientists, philosophers, and theologians to assess how cognitive science reframes the **soul**. The volume presses the claim that **neuroscience** explains capacities once attributed to an immaterial substance, and that biblical eschatology centers on **resurrection**, not the immortality of a separable soul. Murphy’s own constructive case deepens in **Bodies and Souls, or Spirited Bodies?** 2006, where she argues that personhood supervenes on and emerges from the complex organization of the body, especially the **brain**, while retaining robust talk of agency, moral responsibility, and spiritual transformation.

She navigates objections from **Jaegwon Kim** concerning the **causal exclusion** argument by shifting from simple supervenience talk to **causation by constraints**, drawing on **Alicia Juarrero** and later **Terrence Deacon**. Higher-level structures, such as intentions and social practices, operate by constraining lower-level possibilities, producing real **downward causation** without violating conservation laws. Against **John W. Cooper’s** Reformed defense of **holistic dualism**, Murphy maintains that the biblical emphasis on the unity of the person and the hope of bodily **resurrection** undercuts the need for a separable **immortal soul**. She treats the **intermediate state** as an open question, suggesting that divine preservation or re-creation suffices for soteriological continuity. The anthropology is resolutely embodied, thoroughly empirical, yet normatively ordered by **Scripture** and the church’s practices.

#### 5. Freedom, responsibility, and the mind-brain debate
With **Warren S. Brown**, Murphy pursues the vexed issues of **free will** and moral responsibility under physicalist constraints in **Did My Neurons Make Me Do It?** 2007. They critique both reductionistic determinism and libertarian conceptions that require **contra-causal** powers, proposing instead an emergentist account of **agency** compatible with the neurosciences. Agency is explained in terms of **top-down** organization and feedback across **neural networks**, where learning, social practices, and character shape the possibilities space of the organism. The authors lean toward a modest **compatibilism** in which responsible action requires ownership by the whole person, not causal isolation from bodily processes.

Here Murphy integrates **virtue ethics** into cognitive architecture, arguing that habituated dispositions are realized in neural plasticity and yet retain the normative grammar of **practical wisdom**. She draws on **Donald Davidson’s** anomalous monism to protect the irreducibility of the mental to strict lawlike physical description, and counters **Kim’s** supervenience-based worries by emphasizing dynamic systems and **constraint**. Theologically, the work underwrites practices of **sanctification** and **moral formation** without positing a dual-substance **soul**, insisting that grace works through embodied, communal disciplines that reshape neural and social ecologies.

#### 6. Kenosis, providence, and divine action
Murphy’s theology of **divine action** is framed by **kenosis** and the structure of the world as a layered system. In **On the Moral Nature of the Universe** 1996, she and **Ellis** propose that God’s providential governance is not primarily coercive but persuasive, operating through the emergence of **moral order** and the enabling of creaturely self-organization. The model aligns with **noninterventionist objective divine action** in the **CTNS** literature and resonates with **John Polkinghorne’s** openness to indeterminacy while avoiding claims of direct quantum manipulation. The stress on **kenotic self-limitation** grounds a theodicy of divine patience, maintaining that God secures long-term goods by respecting created causal structures and enabling **top-down** moral causation in personal and social life.

Critics worry that such a model risks diluting **providence**, but Murphy sees it as new wine in old skins, an update of classical **concursus** in light of complex systems. Theological rationality, on her account, must be responsive to empirical knowledge about how causation in fact works. She argues that theology fails both truth and charity if it ignores the grain of creation as disclosed by the sciences, and that **kenosis** is the Christological grammar that holds together divine sovereignty and creaturely freedom.

#### 7. Anglo-American postmodernity and communal rationality
Murphy’s **Anglo-American Postmodernity** 1997 and subsequent essays elaborate a vision of theological knowing as practice-laden, tradition-constituted, and governed by **virtues of inquiry**. Against both authoritarian **fundamentalism** and thin **liberalism**, she commends communities that inculcate intellectual humility, courage, and justice, measured by their problem-solving power and capacity to integrate **Scripture**, **tradition**, and **empirical** inputs. The model borrows from **MacIntyre** and **Wittgenstein**, emphasizing the inextricability of rationality and formation. It also resonates with her Anabaptist sympathies toward **peace**, **discipleship**, and congregational discernment.

The upshot is a re-centering of theology’s epistemic life in the church’s practices rather than in isolated Cartesian subjects. The Bible functions as the **canon** within a research programme, authoritatively shaping the **hard core** while leaving room for theory change in the **protective belt** as sciences mature. Murphy’s method thus preserves confessional stability while inviting disciplined experimentation, a balance she deems essential for speaking credibly in the public square about **evolution**, **neuroscience**, and **ethics**.

#### 8. Interlocutors, debates, and developments
Murphy’s proposals catalyze extensive dialogue. With **Plantinga** and **Wolterstorff**, she shares a rejection of **classical foundationalism** but disputes the adequacy of **warrant** as rooted in a **sensus divinitatis**, preferring **public criteria** akin to **Lakatos**. With **Kim**, she faces the causal exclusion problem and replies with **constraint-based** accounts drawn from **Juarrero** and **Deacon**, a move that shifts the conversation from supervenience metaphysics to dynamic systems. With **John W. Cooper**, she debates the biblical and philosophical stakes of **holistic dualism** versus **nonreductive physicalism**, insisting that **resurrection** suffices for eschatological hope. With **Ian Barbour** and **John Polkinghorne**, she refines the modeling of **divine action**, resisting both interventionism and deistic distance.

Over time, Murphy’s language migrates from early talk of **supervenience** to thicker notions of **emergence** and **downward causation**, mirroring broader trends in philosophy of mind. Her orientation is consistently empirical without collapsing into **reductionism**, consistently confessional without retreating to **fideism**. The intellectual through-line is the conviction that **theology-as-research-programme** can prosper by learning from the sciences how explanatory progress happens, all under the banner of **kenotic love** embodied in the life of the church.

#### 9. Reformed/WTS evaluation
A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation discerns both fruitful convergences and principled tensions with Murphy’s project. Positively, her rejection of **foundationalism**, her appeal to **critical realism**, and her commitment to theology’s public **rational accountability** echo **Bavinck’s** organic view of science and **Kuyper’s** sphere-sensitive account of knowledge under common grace. Her emphasis on **resurrection**, embodied **sanctification**, and the formative primacy of the **church’s practices** complements Reformed stress on covenantal life and the lordship of **Christ** over creaturely vocations. Yet key divergences remain. First, Murphy’s **postfoundational** criteria derived from **Lakatos** risk subordinating the principium externum and internum of Reformed theology, namely **Scripture** as self-authenticating Word through the **Spirit**, to extra-canonical standards of progressive problem-solving. A Reformed alternative would affirm public accountability while maintaining **Scripture’s sufficiency and perspicuity** as the constitutive norm for the hard core, with empirical data ministerially, not magisterially, positioned. Second, her **nonreductive physicalism** challenges classical Reformed accounts of **the soul**, **imago Dei**, and the **intermediate state**. While hylomorphic revisions are possible within Reformed orthodoxy, Murphy’s reticence regarding a **substantial soul** strains confessional articulations of personal persistence between death and resurrection and the soul’s immediate communion with **Christ**. Third, her **kenotic divine action** model tends to attenuate **providence** and **meticulous sovereignty** as historically confessed, blurring the grammar of **concursus** and the primacy of God’s decretive will. A Reformed response would commend robust **compatibilism** about human agency, divine concurrence with all secondary causes, and a noncompetitive account of transcendence that renders special **providence** and miracle coherent without violating creation. Finally, while Murphy’s **methodological naturalism** can be embraced as a heuristic, its theological extension warrants caution lest the church’s doctrine be normed by mutable scientific paradigms. In sum, Reformed theology can learn from Murphy’s virtues of inquiry and embodied anthropology while urging stronger **Scripture-principled** normativity, a more explicit **hylomorphic** or **dualist** account of personal identity, and a classical **providence** that frames divine action and human responsibility within the covenantal economy of grace.
