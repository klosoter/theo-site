### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
David S. Fergusson emerges within the **Scottish Reformed** tradition, educated amid the intellectual afterglow of the **Scottish Enlightenment** and ordained for ministry in the **Church of Scotland**, a context that demanded both **dogmatic rigor** and **public theology**. His academic trajectory runs through Scottish posts to **Professor of Divinity at New College, University of Edinburgh** in 2000 and then **Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge** in 2021, anchoring his work in institutions historically tied to **Reformed catholic** learning. Methodologically he advances a **Reformed catholicity** that retrieves **Augustine**, **Aquinas**, and **Calvin** while engaging **Barth** and **T. F. Torrance** with measured sympathy. He favors what he calls a **polyphonic approach** to doctrine, where biblical exegesis, historical voices, and philosophical analysis sound together, governed by **trinitarian doxology** and **eschatological reserve**. His epistemic stance exhibits a chastened **natural theology** that refuses rationalist hubris but acknowledges **general revelation** and **common rational goods** in civil society, positioning theology to speak across confessional boundaries with **public reason** without abandoning **sola Scriptura** and **confessional** commitments.

The historical horizon of late-modern Scotland gives his voice urgency. The pressures of **secularization**, the critiques of **New Atheism**, and the fragility of **civil society** call forth a theology able to articulate **creation**, **providence**, and **moral order** with both humility and confidence. Against reductionist **scientism** and thin political liberalism, Fergusson proposes a **dogmatics for public life**, in which **providence** orders the world to **creational goods** and **eschatological hope**, while **common grace** sustains a shared moral grammar. This methodological poise yields a theologian who can step from **Augustinian confession** to **civic prudence**, from **trinitarian ontology** to the ethics of **civil society**, without dissolving either the theological or the political into the other.

#### 2. Early contributions: church, state, and the civic middle
In **Church, State and Civil Society** 2004, Fergusson reconstructs a Reformed account of **public theology** by retrieving **Augustinian realism** and **Scottish civic traditions**. He resists both ecclesial withdrawal and state absolutism, commending **civil society** as the mediating sphere in which **associations, churches, universities, and charities** exercise responsibility under **providence**. Drawing on **Calvin’s twofold government**, **Kuyperian sphere sovereignty**, and the **Scottish Enlightenment** concern for virtue, he presents a view of **public reason** that acknowledges **common grace** while refusing neutrality myths. The doctrine of **creation ex nihilo** grounds the givenness of natural goods, while **providence** underwrites the possibility of moral order without collapsing the **saeculum** into the **civitas Dei**.

The argument unfolds as a careful negotiation of **liberalism** and **communitarianism**, interlocuting with **O'Donovan** on authority, **Hauerwas** on ecclesial ethics, and **MacIntyre** on practices and virtues. Fergusson proposes an **Augustinian civic modesty**, insisting that Christian participation in **civil society** is penultimate and proximate, oriented by **eschatological hope** and governed by **charity**. This public theology is not a detour from dogmatics but a corollary of **providence** and **creation**, mediated by **secondary causality** and the integrity of creaturely action. The result is a **Reformed retrieval** of the civic middle that resists both theocratic shortcuts and privatized faith.

#### 3. Faith and critique: engaging the new atheism
With **Faith and Its Critics** in 2009, Fergusson enters the arena of **apologetics** without conceding the terms to **New Atheism**. He engages **Richard Dawkins**, **Christopher Hitchens**, and their peers not by counter-assertion but by thickening the **rationality of faith**. Here he draws on **Augustine’s credere ut intelligas**, **Aquinas’s** arguments within a broader **natural theology**, and **Reformed** emphases on the **testimony of the Spirit** and the **self-authenticating Scripture**, crafting a cumulative case for the intellectual responsibility of Christian belief. He neither absolutizes **natural theology** nor rejects it; rather, he develops a **chastened natural theology** that, under **providence**, recognizes the intelligibility of the world, the fit between **reason** and **creation**, and the public availability of certain theistic judgments.

Importantly, Fergusson refuses **theodicy** as a systematic solution to evil, preferring an **anti-theodicy** posture that upholds **lament**, **protest**, and **hope**. This posture anticipates the later **providence** project and embeds **eschatological reserve** into his apologetic method. He closes ranks with **Barth** where the sovereignty of **revelation** is at stake, but remains more open than strict Barthianism to **general revelation** and **natural theology**, aligning him with a **Reformed catholic** stream that runs from **Calvin** through **Turretin** to select contemporary voices. The result is a defense of faith that is public, dialogical, and doxological, without procedural secularism or fideist retreat.

#### 4. Creation: doctrine, science, and hope
In **Creation** 2014, Fergusson presents a compact but rich dogmatic account of **creation ex nihilo**, **providence**, and **eschatology** in conversation with **scripture**, **patristic sources**, and contemporary **science and religion**. He distinguishes **creation** as a fundamental relation from cosmological origins, thereby protecting the doctrine from reduction to **scientific cosmology** while welcoming genuine dialogue with **evolutionary biology** and **Big Bang** narratives under **divine concurrence**. The creator-creature relation is unpacked with **Aquinas’s** grammar of **primary and secondary causality**, a scheme that preserves **divine simplicity** and **immutability** while safeguarding creaturely integrity. The **Sabbath** is treated as a sign of **teleology** and **eschatological rest**, integrating **creation** and **consummation** within a **trinitarian economy**.

The book also advances a pastoral metaphysic of **gift** and **gratitude**, drawing from **Augustine** and **Calvin** on the goodness of the world and the discipline of **thanksgiving**. Fergusson’s account of **providence** begins to surface here as a theology of **participation** rather than micromanagement, wary of collapsing **compatibilism** into fatalism or conceding to **open theism**. He resists **process theism** and **deistic separation**, offering instead a classically **theistic** yet humane rendering of **providence** that can speak to ecological concern, human suffering, and the dignity of ordinary work. In sum, **Creation** provides the conceptual and affective architecture for his later systematic treatment of **providence**.

#### 5. Providence: a polyphonic Reformed account
The culmination of this trajectory appears in **The Providence of God** 2018, a full-scale dogmatics of **providence** written in the **polyphonic** key he favors. Fergusson orchestrates **biblical testimony** from wisdom literature, prophetic texts, and New Testament witness to **Christ’s lordship**, with **Augustine’s** sovereign governance, **Aquinas’s** **divine concurrence**, and **Calvin’s** fierce insistence on **God’s fatherly hand**. He reads the tradition critically and charitably, acknowledging the pastoral power of **Calvin’s autotheos** and the metaphysical precision of **Thomistic** accounts, while highlighting the need for **eschatological reserve** in speaking of God’s governance of evil. The book rejects **deterministic providence** that erases contingency, rebuffs **open theism** as insufficiently honoring **divine foreknowledge**, and distances itself from **process theism** on grounds of **divine aseity** and **immutability**.

A distinctive feature is his refusal of comprehensive **theodicy**. Fergusson commends **lament**, **petitionary prayer**, and **hope** as practical postures that honor both **God’s sovereignty** and creaturely suffering. His account of **secondary causality** protects created agencies, thereby preserving the moral significance of events and actions under **providence**. He treats **miracle** as a sign of **eschatological inbreaking** rather than a violation of created order, aligning with a **sacramental reading** of creation. The book closes with **pastoral theology**, where **providence** grounds patience, courage, and joy, and with **public theology**, where **providence** warrants investment in **civil society** and the pursuit of **penultimate goods** under **common grace**. This is a confident yet restrained **Reformed** rendering of **providence**, catholic in scope and attuned to late-modern sensibilities.

#### 6. Scottish retrieval and catholic horizons
Fergusson’s editorial leadership in **The History of Scottish Theology** 2019–2020, co-edited with **Mark W. Elliott**, discloses his wider theological map. The three volumes trace lines from **John Knox** and **Andrew Melville**, through figures like **Samuel Rutherford**, **John McLeod Campbell**, and **T. F. Torrance**, to contemporary debates, situating the **Reformed** tradition within broader **catholic** and **ecumenical** currents. This work embodies his conviction that a living **dogmatics** is nourished by history, and that the **Scottish Enlightenment** both challenged and refined **Reformed orthodoxy**. He reads **Hume** and **Reid** not as enemies to be dismissed but as conversation partners who sharpen Christian accounts of **causality**, **miracle**, and **testimony**.

Within this historiography, Fergusson models how **retrieval** can be critical without iconoclasm. His engagements with **Barth** and **Torrance** are exemplary. He affirms their **Christological concentration** and their rejection of **natural theology** unmoored from **revelation**, yet he declines the more apocalyptic rhetoric that marginalizes **general revelation** and **civil society**. The result is a **Reformed catholic** stance that can affirm **Nicene** and **Chalcedonian** orthodoxy, uphold **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, and still argue for a chastened **natural theology** compatible with **Calvin’s duplex cognitio Dei** and the **Book of Nature** under **Scripture’s** primacy.

#### 7. Christology, anthropology, and eschatology in minor key
Although **providence** and **creation** dominate his corpus, Fergusson’s essays and lectures contribute to **Christology**, **theological anthropology**, and **eschatology** in a coherent minor key. He frames **incarnation** as the definitive pledge of **creation’s goodness**, linking **Christology** to **anthropology** through themes of **image of God**, **sin**, and **grace**. His treatment of **original sin** exhibits **Augustinian** gravity without speculative excess, locating human disorder within **providence** and clarifying the limits of **theodicy**. On **resurrection** and **hope**, he emphasizes **eschatological reserve** and the grammar of **promise**, refusing premature systematization of the **intermediate state** while maintaining robust **bodily resurrection** and **new creation**.

These doctrinal notes resonate with his public concerns. A sober **anthropology** underwrites his confidence in **civil society** as a penultimate good, curbing utopianism while motivating reform. **Christological** concentration keeps **providence** christocentrically defined, preventing drift toward generic theism. And **eschatology** disciplines both **apologetics** and **ethics**, recasting **theodicy** into **prayer** and **patience**. Across these loci, Fergusson’s voice remains **Reformed**, **catholic**, and attuned to the actualities of late-modern life.

#### 8. Style, tone, and pastoral aims
Fergusson’s prose is marked by **clarity**, **modesty**, and an aversion to polemical overreach. He writes **theology as wisdom**, a habit shaped by **Augustinian** spirituality and **Scottish** sensibilities about public discourse. His repeated insistence on **polyphony** and **eschatological reserve** is not mere method; it is a moral stance formed by the conviction that **providence** means both divine faithfulness and creaturely contingency. He favors **cumulative arguments** over knockdown proofs, **dialogue** over denunciation, and **public reason** over sectarian jargon, all without diluting **Reformed** distinctives like **sola gratia** and the centrality of **Scripture**.

Pastorally, his agenda is to resource churches facing **secularization** with a confident doctrine of **creation** and **providence**, equipping Christians to pursue **penultimate goods** in **civil society** while awaiting **eschatological consummation**. He urges **prayer**, **worship**, and **moral action** as the lived grammar of **providence**, and he treats **lament** and **thanksgiving** as paired dispositions under **God’s fatherly hand**. In these ways his dogmatics fosters acts of **gratitude**, **courage**, and **hope**, theological virtues that can sustain witness in a culture often impatient with metaphysics and allergic to **transcendence**.

#### 9. Integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and especially a **Westminster** frame, Fergusson offers significant gifts alongside points of tension. Positively, his defense of **creation ex nihilo**, **divine simplicity**, and **providence** retrieves **classical theism** with pastoral care, and his accent on **secondary causality** rightly guards creaturely integrity under **divine concurrence**. His account of **common grace**, **civil society**, and **penultimate goods** coheres with **Kuyperian** and **Old Princeton** instincts, and his refusal of speculative **theodicy** honors the biblical grammar of **lament** and **hope**. His engagement with **Aquinas**, **Calvin**, and **Barth** models a **Reformed catholicity** that many confessional communities can embrace.

The tensions surface where his **chastened natural theology** and appeal to **public reason** risk softening **noetic effects of sin** and the principled **antithesis** that a **Van Tilian** line would stress. A Westminster reading will also press whether his **anti-theodicy** stance, while pastorally wise, inadequately specifies **decretive will**, **meticulous sovereignty**, and a robust **compatibilism** that secures **divine ordination** of whatsoever comes to pass. Some will judge his polyphonic method to introduce a procedural pluralism that can obscure **Scripture’s principium** and the clarity of **covenant theology**. An alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would foreground **covenantal revelation** as the architectonic frame of **creation and providence**, articulate **meticulous providence** with careful use of **primary and secondary causes**, and restrict **natural theology** to ministerial service under **Scripture**. Yet even from this vantage, Fergusson’s careful articulation of **providence**, his disciplined **eschatological reserve**, and his constructive **public theology** remain exemplary contributions that deserve serious appropriation and critical engagement.
