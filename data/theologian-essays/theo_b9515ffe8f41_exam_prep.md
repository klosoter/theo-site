### TITLE
Anselm of Canterbury is the paradigmatic High Medieval scholastic who bequeaths to the church a rationally articulated satisfaction atonement and a fides quaerens intellectum approach that Reformed orthodoxy both appropriates and sharply qualifies.

### PREVIEW NOTES
- **Anselm of Canterbury** 1033–1109 stands at the dawn of **High Medieval Scholasticism** using the emerging schools of **Beauvais** and **Bec** to systematize Augustinian theology.
- As archbishop of **Canterbury** amid **Gregorian Reform** conflicts 1093–1109 he embodies the monastic-episcopal culture that shapes Latin **medieval theology**.

- His famous motto **fides quaerens intellectum** faith seeking understanding captures a method where **reason** serves faith by drawing out necessary implications from what God has revealed.
- In works like the **Monologion** and **Proslogion** he deploys rational argumentation on the basis of a Christian **confessional starting point** rather than autonomous natural reason.
- He privileges **necessary reasons** over mere authority of Scripture or church so that theology aims at seeing why the faith must be so in light of divine **simplicity** and **necessity**.

- In **Monologion** c. 1076 he offers a rational meditation on **divine attributes** and the existence of the highest good without explicit appeal to Scripture.
- In **Proslogion** c. 1077–78 he articulates the famous **ontological argument** for Gods existence grounded in the claim that God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived.
- In **Cur Deus Homo** c. 1095–98 he formulates a systematic account of the **atonement** as satisfaction of divine honor, arguing why God became man must be a God-man to make adequate satisfaction.
- In **De Concordia** c. 1107 he treats **foreknowledge**, **predestination**, and free choice, seeking a rational concord among these doctrines.

- His most decisive impact lands on **doctrines of God**, especially divine **simplicity**, necessity, and aseity, through arguments in the **Monologion** and **Proslogion**.
- He reconfigures Latin understanding of **atonement** and **Christology** through Cur Deus Homo, influencing later Reformed accounts of penal substitution and satisfaction.
- He significantly shapes medieval discussions of **grace and freedom** in De Concordia, affecting how later scholastics and Reformers parse human willing under divine sovereignty.

- A Westminster examiner will want me to affirm **Anselms** rational defense of classical **theism** and his God-centered account of the cross while critiquing his underdeveloped appeal to Scripture and covenant.
- I must position **Cur Deus Homo** as a crucial yet incomplete step toward Reformed **penal substitution**, and his ontological argument as a key moment in natural theology needing **Van Tilian** qualification.

- I should be ready to compare **Anselm and Augustine** on grace, will, and divine simplicity, especially how Anselm extends Augustinian intuitions by more formal argument.
- I should contrast **Anselm and Aquinas** on reason and nature and also **Anselm and the Reformers** on atonement and Scripture to show confessional discernment.

### ESSAY

#### 1. Formation, context, and driving problem
**Anselm of Canterbury** was born in Aosta in 1033, entered the Benedictine abbey of **Bec** in Normandy around 1060, became prior under **Lanfranc**, and abbot in 1078, then archbishop of **Canterbury** in 1093, dying in 1109. He stands at the transition from the monastic theology of **Augustine** and **Gregory the Great** to the more formal **scholastic** method that would bloom in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. His intellectual life is framed by the **Gregorian Reform**, disputes with English kings **William II** and **Henry I** about investiture, and the emerging network of cathedral schools that cultivate logical analysis. In this setting, his driving problem is how to render the inherited **catholic faith** not only believed but seen as necessary, how to move from *credere Deum esse* to *intelligere quid sit Deus* and why the incarnation and cross were fitting.

The fundamental theological problem for **Anselm** is the relation of **faith and reason** in the knowledge of God and in the understanding of salvation. Surrounded by critics and skeptics within Latin Christendom who asked whether traditional doctrines were arbitrary or irrational, he seeks a mode of discourse in which the church can confess that it believes and also understand why it must be so. This is explicit in the **Proslogion**, where he prays, Lord, teach me to seek you, and in **Cur Deus Homo**, where he undertakes, at the request of **Boso**, to show by necessary reasons why it was fitting and necessary that God become man. Thus the driving problem is not doubt in a modern sense, but a burden to show the rational coherence and inner necessity of **classical theism** and the **incarnation**.

#### 2. Method and sources (how they know and speak about God)
Anselms method is often summarized in his phrase **fides quaerens intellectum**, faith seeking understanding, stated programmatically in the **Proslogion**. He begins from the stance of a believer within the **church**, confessing the creed and submitting to Scripture and the rule of faith, yet he insists that the believing mind is to press forward to see, as far as it can, the inner rationality of what it believes. Faith gives the starting point and the content, but **reason** is summoned to explore why the given content must be so for a God who is the greatest conceivable being. This produces a distinct mode of theological argumentation that is prayerful and contemplative yet relentlessly rational. Reformed theology, following **Calvin** and **Turretin**, appreciates this subordination of reason to revelation, though it is more cautious about Anselms tendency to move quickly from faiths starting point to rationally necessary conclusions.

Regarding **revelation** and Scripture, Anselm is deeply shaped by the **Vulgate** and patristic tradition, yet in his most famous works he largely brackets explicit biblical exegesis. The **Monologion** and **Proslogion** self-consciously proceed from what any rational mind granting certain premises can see about God as highest good or as that than which nothing greater can be conceived. He does not deny Scripture; rather, he seeks to show that what Scripture teaches concerning God, creation, and salvation is in accord with what right **reason** discovers once it is placed within the horizon of faith. This creates a tension with later Reformed method, typified by **Bavinck** and **Vos**, which will insist that theology must be more explicitly exegetical and redemptive-historical, not simply rational from Christian premises.

In Anselm, **experience** is primarily the interior experience of the praying monk who longs for God, as in the **Proslogion** and **Meditationes**, not the broader historical or cultural experience emphasized by modern theologians. History appears in his work largely as the arena in which the necessary divine plan is executed: God created, man fell, and the **God-man** comes to satisfy. The church appears as the community that hands on the creed and catechizes the mind into these truths, yet in argument Anselm relies more on **necessary reasons** than on the external authority of councils. Reformed orthodoxy can resonate with his contemplative piety and his high view of the **church**, yet will want to insist more clearly that Scripture as canon, not rational necessity, is the principium cognoscendi of theology.

#### 3. Major doctrinal contributions by locus

First, in the doctrine of God, classical orthodoxy confesses one simple, immutable, infinite **God**, the creator and Lord of all, known by his names and works in Scripture, and described in terms of **simplicity**, aseity, and perfection. Anselm radicalizes and articulates this confession philosophically in the **Monologion** c. 1076 and **Proslogion** c. 1077–78. In the Monologion he argues from the existence of degrees of goodness to the existence of a highest good, which must be **self-sufficient being** from whom all others receive goodness. In the Proslogion he develops his famous **ontological argument**: God is that than which nothing greater can be conceived, and such a being cannot exist only in the understanding but must exist in reality, for existence in re is greater than existence only in intellectu. His interlocutors include the anonymous **Gaunilo of Marmoutiers**, who objects on behalf of the fool that such reasoning could prove too much. Later Reformed thinkers like **Calvin** and **Bavinck** will affirm the substance of Anselms classical theism and strong account of divine perfection, while questioning the apologetic utility of the ontological argument in a fallen noetic context.

Second, in the locus of **Christology and atonement**, the catholic baseline is the Chalcedonian confession of one person in two natures and the patristic emphasis on Christ defeating death and the devil. Anselm in **Cur Deus Homo** c. 1095–98 reframes the question: not first how Christ defeats the devil, but why God became man to satisfy divine honor. Human sin has violated the honor of God, creating a debt that humans, as finite and guilty, cannot repay. God cannot simply remit this debt without compromising his justice and order, yet he wills to save. Hence the **necessity** of the incarnation: only a **God-man** can make adequate satisfaction, since as man he owes satisfaction on behalf of man, and as God his act has infinite worth. Anselm here displaces earlier **ransom-to-Satan** motifs and inaugurates the satisfaction model that shapes Western theology. His dialogue partner **Boso** articulates common objections, and later theologians such as **Abelard** will critique his strong emphasis on divine honor. Reformed orthodoxy gratefully receives Anselms insistence that the cross is objective satisfaction rendered to God, and yet it sharpens this in terms of penal substitution under the order of divine law, with more explicit exegetical grounding.

Third, in the area of **grace, freedom, and predestination**, the Augustinian baseline affirms the priority of divine grace, the bondage of the will in sin, and predestination unto life, while upholding human responsibility. Anselm follows **Augustine** yet develops his own distinctions in works such as **De Libertate Arbitrii** c. 1085 and **De Concordia** c. 1107. For Anselm, true freedom is not the sheer ability to choose either sin or righteousness; rather, it is the ability to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake. In the state of innocence, man had this ability; in sin, he has lost rectitude and thus cannot will rightly without grace. In De Concordia, Anselm insists that **divine foreknowledge** and **predestination** are infallible, yet they do not impose necessity in a coercive sense upon the human will, since Gods knowledge is not temporally prior and his predetermination orders events without violating the mode of created willing. His interlocutors include those who fear that strong divine predestination evacuates human responsibility. Later Reformed theologians such as **Turretin** will appreciate Anselms compatibilist instincts but will find his treatments relatively underdeveloped compared to later distinctions about natural and moral ability.

Fourth, in **theological method and epistemology**, the catholic baseline is that Scripture is the inspired norm for doctrine, read within the **churchs** rule of faith, with reason as a minister. Anselms contribution, especially in the **Monologion** and **Proslogion**, is to model a highly rational, almost a priori, meditation on God, starting not from exegesis but from a concept of God as the greatest conceivable being and drawing out consequences about attributes, creation, and the incarnation. His method anticipates later **scholastic** distinctions and the careful use of **logic** in theology. His implicit interlocutors are both simple traditionalists who are content merely to assert the creed without rational understanding and skeptics who demand proofs apart from faith. While **Calvin** and **Van Til** will insist more strongly on the noetic consequences of sin and the primacy of Scripture, they still stand in a line that values clear conceptual articulation of divine attributes and the rational inner coherence of the Christian system, something Anselm helped pioneer.

#### 4. Relation to Reformed orthodoxy and later reception
Reformed orthodoxy receives **Anselm** with both gratitude and caution. On the doctrine of God, figures like **Bavinck** and **Turretin** stand very much within an Anselmian and Augustinian line of **classical theism**: they affirm divine simplicity, immutability, infinity, and aseity, and they see God as the highest good, the fullness of being, and the one from whom and to whom are all things. Yet they do not elevate the **ontological argument** to a central apologetic, recognizing with **Calvin** and later **Van Til** that sinful man suppresses the knowledge of God and that starting from creaturely concepts of greatness is not religiously or epistemologically neutral. On the atonement, Reformed theology strongly appropriates Anselms insight that Christ objectively satisfies the claims of divine justice and restores the order of Gods honor, yet it explicitly recasts this satisfaction in terms of Christ bearing the **penal** consequences of the broken law, rather than placing the primary focus on feudal notions of honor. Here **Calvin** in the Institutes and **Westminster Confession of Faith** chapter 8 deepen and scripturalize the Anselmian pattern.

Westminster examiners will especially object to two tendencies in **Anselm**. First, they will criticize his relative lack of explicit **Scripture** and covenantal structure in key dogmatic treatments, which from a **Vosian** perspective risks detaching doctrine from the concrete history of redemption. Second, they will question his near axiomatic use of rational **necessity** in Cur Deus Homo, where he speaks of what God must do, rather than giving primacy to Gods free decree. At the same time, Reformed theologians can learn much from Anselms profound God-centeredness, his insistence that theology should strive for rational coherence, and his refusal to make either divine justice or mercy arbitrary. His contemplative, prayer-infused method, seen in the **Proslogion**, models a piety in which rigorous thought and humble adoration coexist, something that **Westminster** theology would affirm and seek to incarnate in a more explicitly biblical key.

#### 5. Exam hooks and landmines
In an oral exam, some sentences about **Anselm** are safe and even helpful to say almost verbatim. One can say: Anselm of Canterbury is the paradigmatic early scholastic who defines theology as **fides quaerens intellectum**, faith seeking understanding, and who gives us the classic satisfaction account of the atonement in Cur Deus Homo. Another safe opener is: In Anselm we see a deeply Augustinian, monastic theologian using emerging scholastic tools to articulate **classical theism** and the necessity of the God-man for our salvation. Such formulations reassure the committee that I see both his setting in **High Medieval Scholasticism** and his abiding contributions to the doctrine of God and the cross. It is also safe to note that the Reformed doctrine of penal substitution develops and sharpens the Anselmian satisfaction model rather than discarding it.

There are also phrases and emphases that require careful qualification. I should avoid simply praising **Anselms ontological argument** as a knockdown proof for all rational persons; instead I should say that Anselm gives a classic formulation of an a priori argument that later Reformed thinkers receive as an internal clarification for believers rather than as an autonomous foundation for natural theology. I must also be careful with Anselms language of **necessity** in Cur Deus Homo: I should not say that God was constrained by some external law to send Christ, but that given Gods own just and wise nature, Anselm seeks to show that the incarnation is the fitting and internally necessary way in which God chose to save. Similarly, I must not equate Anselms satisfaction of divine **honor** directly with Reformed penal substitution; instead, I should say that the Reformers, especially **Calvin**, retain his Godward, objective satisfaction while framing it more explicitly in juridical and covenantal terms grounded in Scripture.

Examiners often exploit misunderstandings about **Anselm**. Many students think of him only as a philosopher of religion offering an isolated **ontological argument**, ignoring his monastic piety and his integration of prayer and argument. It is important to stress that the Proslogion is an address to God and that his arguments function within **faith**. Others caricature Cur Deus Homo as crude feudalism, where God is offended in a merely anthropomorphic sense; I must emphasize that, although Anselm uses the language of feudal honor, he is ultimately speaking of the moral order inherent in Gods righteous character. Another common mistake is to contrast Anselm with **Augustine** as if Anselm were less Augustinian on grace. In fact, he stands in a strongly Augustinian line on original sin and the priority of grace, though he does not elaborate as fully as later scholastics or Reformers. Finally, students sometimes say that Anselm does not use Scripture and so is purely rationalist; the better formulation is to say that he presupposes and confesses Scripture yet experiments with a method that foregrounds **reason** more than later Reformed theology would allow as the structural norm of dogmatics.

#### 6. Reformed/WTS evaluation (single paragraph)
From a Westminster perspective, **Anselm of Canterbury** is a crucial yet limited ally: we warmly affirm his robust **classical theism**, his insistence that theology is *fides quaerens intellectum*, and his epochal contribution in Cur Deus Homo that the atonement is an objective satisfaction rendered to God by the incarnate Son, while we must firmly deny any implication that rational necessity or feudal honor stand over Gods free decree or that a near-scriptureless method can norm dogmatics. Where I land is this: Anselm is a profoundly Augustinian forerunner whose doctrine of God and satisfaction atonement Reformed orthodoxy gratefully receives and exegetically deepens, yet his reliance on the **ontological argument** and on a priori necessity must be subordinated to a self-consciously revelational, covenantal, and Christocentric method shaped by the whole counsel of God.

### RECAP NOTES

ORAL OPENING:
- Anselm of Canterbury is the early scholastic who defines theology as **fides quaerens intellectum** and gives the West its classic satisfaction account of the atonement.

TIMELINE & WORKS:
- **Anselm** was born in 1033 in Aosta, became abbot of **Bec**, archbishop of **Canterbury** in 1093, and died in 1109 amid the Gregorian Reform.
- In the **Monologion** c. 1076 and **Proslogion** c. 1077–78 he meditates rationally on **divine attributes** and offers the famous ontological argument.
- In **Cur Deus Homo** c. 1095–98 and **De Concordia** c. 1107 he treats the necessity of the **God-man** for satisfaction and the harmony of foreknowledge and free will.

METHOD & EPISTEMOLOGY:
- For **Anselm**, theology is **faith seeking understanding**, where the believer uses reason to see the inner necessity of what revelation teaches.
- He presupposes **Scripture** and the creed but in key works he brackets exegesis and argues from rational concepts like the greatest conceivable being.
- He views history and **experience** mainly as the stage for the execution of the necessary divine plan rather than as the primary source for dogmatic formulation.

KEY DOCTRINAL MOVES:
- In the **Proslogion**, Anselm argues that God as that than which nothing greater can be conceived must exist, the classic **ontological argument**.
- In **Cur Deus Homo**, he teaches that human sin offends divine **honor** and only the **God-man** can render adequate satisfaction for our salvation.
- In **De Libertate Arbitrii**, he defines true **freedom** as the ability to preserve rectitude of will for its own sake rather than mere power of contrary choice.
- In **De Concordia**, he insists that divine **foreknowledge** and **predestination** are infallible yet compatible with genuine human responsibility.
- Across his works, he advances a rigorous **classical theism** centered on divine simplicity, aseity, and perfection as highest good.

REFORMED TENSION POINTS:
- Westminster examiners will press Anselms limited use of explicit **Scripture** and covenant in forming doctrine, especially in **Cur Deus Homo**.
- They will question the apologetic weight given to the **ontological argument** in light of **Van Tilian** concerns about autonomous reason and the noetic effects of sin.
- They will urge rearticulation of Anselms satisfaction of divine **honor** into explicitly **penal substitution** grounded in the law-covenant framework.
- They will challenge his strong language of rational **necessity** for the incarnation, insisting on Gods free decree rather than any external constraint.

COMPARISON HANDLES:
- **Anselm vs Augustine** on grace and freedom highlights Anselm as a more explicitly analytic yet still Augustinian theologian of the will.
- **Anselm vs Aquinas** on **natural theology** contrasts Anselms a priori ontological argument with Aquinas more empirical *viae*.
- **Anselm vs Calvin** on the atonement contrasts satisfaction of divine **honor** with fully penal, covenantal substitution.
- **Anselm vs Van Til** on rational argument shows the shift from medieval confidence in necessary reasons to a presuppositional critique of neutral reason.

ONE-SENTENCE VERDICT:
- Anselm is a profoundly Augustinian and classically theist forerunner whose satisfaction atonement and faith-seeking-understanding ideal the Reformed gratefully receive yet rigorously subordinate to Scripture, covenant, and the primacy of Gods free decree.
