### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
David H. Kelsey emerged as a major contemporary voice in theological anthropology from the distinctive ferment of the **Yale School**, shaped by **Hans Frei’s** narrative sensibility and **George Lindbeck’s** cultural-linguistic turn, while under the long shadow of **Karl Barth’s** primacy of revelation. Teaching for decades at **Yale Divinity School**, Kelsey navigated late twentieth-century arguments about **hermeneutics**, **philosophy of language**, and the place of **theology in the university**, adopting a modest but rigorously argued non-foundationalism. The hallmark of his method is attention to the **uses of Scripture**, not as a static deposit but as canonically ordered discourse that renders the world as creation, sinners as reconciled, and history as promised **consummation**. His work is deliberately second-order: rather than constructing a system from metaphysical first principles, Kelsey analyzes how Christian communities actually reason theologically, how **doctrinal warrants** function, and how these practices might guide a **wisdom** inquiry into human life *coram Deo*.

Kelsey’s early intellectual terrain was defined by critical engagements with modern systematicians like **Tillich**, **Tracy**, and **Pannenberg**, as well as retrievals of **Aquinas** and **Calvin** under the pressure of **Barth’s** anti-foundationalism. Leaning on **Wittgenstein’s** reminder that meaning is use, and **Stephen Toulmin’s** account of field-dependent arguments, he resisted both positivist biblicism and free-floating metaphysics. The result is a method that is canonical yet analytic, dialectically attentive to **Scripture’s grammar**, the church’s practices of **doctrinal reasoning**, and the limits of philosophical justification before the **mystery of the Triune God**. This posture governs his mature retrieval of the classical loci, refracted through a singular focus: a theological anthropology ordered by **God’s triune acts**.

#### 2. The uses of Scripture and the field of theology
Kelsey’s first major book, **The Uses of Scripture in Recent Theology** (1975), registers his lasting preoccupation with how theology appeals to the **canon**. Rather than treating Scripture as a simple repository of propositions or as an evocative symbol of religious experience, he distinguishes types of use operative in modern theology. He shows that **Barth’s** dogmatics employs Scripture as authoritative witness rendering God’s self-communication; that **Frei’s** narrative construal foregrounds the **Gospel’s** realistic depiction shaping communal imagination; and that correlational projects like **Tillich** and **Tracy** invoke Scripture as a governing symbol set within broader **public reason**. The analysis is diagnostic: particular uses of Scripture carry different **criteria of adequacy**, different senses of what counts as faithful reading, and different accounts of how **doctrine** rightly follows from **exegesis**. Kelsey’s aim is not eclecticism but clarity about the logics internal to these appeals, so that theological argument may be responsibly made in its own field, accountable to the **canon** and to the church’s **rule of faith**.

Linked to that diagnostic labor is **Proving Doctrine: The Uses of Theological Arguments** (1992), which deploys **Toulmin’s** model of claim, warrant, and backing to show that doctrinal claims are justified by field-relative warrants rooted in **Scripture’s canon**, ecclesial **tradition**, and rational **coherence**. Against both positivist demands for neutral proof and fideist refusal of public reasons, Kelsey argues that theology has its own disciplined modes of **proof**, in which warrants are tethered to the practices of reading and confessing **God’s triune economy**. The book turns debates about **method** into attention to the actual work of arguing well, clarifying how attributions to God cohere with the church’s **soteriological** and **eschatological** claims. These early works underwrite all that follows: a constructive project that refuses both metaphysical foundationalism and sheer pragmatics by locating theological knowledge within the church’s canonical-linguistic **habitus**.

#### 3. Theological education and the telos of wisdom
In **To Understand God Truly: What’s Theological about a Theological School?** (1992), Kelsey engages the crisis of **theological education** identified by figures like **Edward Farley**, and the classic **Athens-Berlin** contrast traced by **Jaroslav Pelikan**. Kelsey argues that the distinctive telos of theological schooling is not generic religious studies nor clerical training alone, but the disciplined pursuit of wisdom that enables communities to speak truly of **God** and live well *coram Deo*. The school’s practices of **exegesis**, **doctrinal reasoning**, and **pastoral judgment** are ordered to a single good: understanding God truly through **Scripture’s canon**, within the church, and for the world. This vision resists fragmentation by describing curricula as practices of **improvised fidelity** to the **Triune God** who addresses and forms a people. Here again are Kelsey’s signatures: canonical description, field-relative rationality, and a stress on **practical wisdom** that points forward to his theological anthropology.

This educational vision is neither technocratic nor romantic. It insists on the university’s disciplines while refusing to let external criteria of **scientific rationality** displace **theological judgment**. Kelsey’s critique of instrumentalizing models is anchored in classical claims about **divine providence** and the church’s **catechetical** vocation. By re-centering schooling on understanding God truly, he anticipates the emphasis in **Eccentric Existence** that anthropology must be governed by theology’s own subject matter, namely the **Triune God’s** ways of relating to creatures in **creation**, **reconciliation**, and **consummation**.

#### 4. Imagining redemption without reduction
With **Imagining Redemption** (2005), Kelsey turns from methodological analysis to a constructive meditation on **soteriology** that resists totalizing theories. Rather than treating redemption as a single mechanism captured by a master concept, he offers **thick descriptions** of how God’s **reconciling** action engages particular devastations of human life, from bodily injury to social betrayal. The aim is neither to deny **atonement** doctrines nor to dissolve them into therapeutic uplift, but to recover scriptural imaginations of redemption’s scope and texture. Kelsey’s close attention to **narrative**, embodied fragility, and the stubbornness of damage yields a pastoral-theological grammar in which **grace** is not abstract transaction but God’s active making-new of actual lives.

Throughout, Kelsey resists speculative **theodicy**, arguing that faithful speech about redemption is constrained by **God’s inscrutability** and by Scripture’s witness to **Christ’s cross and resurrection**. He insists that redemption cannot be severed from **creation** or **consummation**, and that the church’s speech must avoid both sentimentalizing suffering and instrumentalizing evil in a rational calculus. The book’s exemplary method is the same: canonical construal, wise restraint, and a refusal to let **theory** outrun **testimony**. This sets the stage for the comprehensive scope of **Eccentric Existence**, where **soteriology** is woven into a larger account of human life before God.

#### 5. Eccentric existence as theological anthropology
Kelsey’s magnum opus, **Eccentric Existence: A Theological Anthropology** (2009), proposes that to be human is to have one’s center outside oneself, defined by **God’s triune relating**. The label eccentric signals that human life is neither self-possessed substance nor autonomous project, but life given, judged, and promised by the **Creator**, **Reconciler**, and **Consummator**. Kelsey refuses the search for a single metaphysical essence, wary of generic **philosophical anthropology**; he instead offers a theological anthropology that is irreducibly **theocentric**, structured by three coordinated foci: human life as **created**, as **reconciled**, and as **consummated**. Each of these is an aspect of God’s relation to all that is not God, and each generates its own set of descriptions about human flourishing, failure, and hope.

Under the rubric of **created living**, Kelsey emphasizes **creaturely contingency**, **ex nihilo** dependence, and the concreteness of bodily, social, and ecological contexts. He treats human beings as **personal bodies** rather than dualistic composites, rejecting both Cartesianism and reductive materialism in favor of a scripturally informed holism. Under **reconciled living**, he describes the depths of estrangement and the concrete forms of **grace** that reconfigure life through **Jesus Christ** in the **Spirit**, where reconciliation is not merely legal but transformative, communal, and liturgical. Under **consummated living**, he attends to **eschatological** promise, the hope that human lives are held in the **resurrection** of the dead and the **new creation**, with ethical implications for patience, protest, and joy. Across these sections, Kelsey mines **biblical narratives**, engages classical voices from **Augustine** to **Aquinas** and **Calvin**, and converses with modern social and biological sciences, all disciplined by a canonical grammar that puts **God’s acts** first.

#### 6. Imago Dei, personhood, and thick description
A central contribution of **Eccentric Existence** is Kelsey’s reframing of **imago Dei**. He resists making the image a metaphysical property or a single ethical mandate and instead treats the **image of God** as a cluster of scriptural idioms whose sense varies across the threefold economy of **creation**, **reconciliation**, and **consummation**. In creation, imaging is vocational, a royal-priestly commission; in reconciliation, it is renewed conformity to **Christ**; in consummation, it is glorification beyond corruption in the **Spirit**. This approach dislodges the imago from speculative anthropology while intensifying its theological depth. Similarly, Kelsey rejects the search for a definitive account of **personal identity** in favor of describing personal bodies whose identities are narrated by God’s **address**, sustained by **providence**, and destined by **promise**. The anthropological payoff is a capacious account of human goods and vulnerabilities: birth, learning, friendship, sexuality, work, suffering, and death are all canvassed as sites where the threefold divine relating takes concrete shape.

The method remains consistent: **thick description** rather than thin definition, where descriptions are canonically warranted and pastorally sensitive. Kelsey’s anthropological judgments are thus tied to practices of **worship**, **discipleship**, and **moral discernment** rather than to universal philosophical axioms. He retrieves classical claims like **divine simplicity** only insofar as they serve canonical descriptions of **God’s triune economy**. The result is a compellingly integrated anthropology that neither capitulates to secular functionalism nor retreats into ecclesial insulation, but pursues wisdom sufficient to speak truthfully about God and human life.

#### 7. Suffering, power, and the refusal of theodicy
Late in his career Kelsey returned explicitly to the problem of evil in **Human Anguish and God’s Power** (2020). Here he deploys the same triune-relational grammar to parse divine **power**: the **Creator’s** nurturing power that gives and sustains life, the **Reconciler’s** reconciling power that heals estrangement, and the **Consummator’s** promising power that secures the end beyond loss. Suffering is not explained away but located within the sweep of **creation**, **cross**, and **resurrection**, with pastoral counsel for communities facing illness, injustice, and death. Kelsey maintains his resistance to speculative **theodicy** by refusing causal accounts that would render evil intelligible under **providence** in ways Scripture itself eschews. Instead, he argues for a grammar of lament, petition, and praise as the proper **liturgical** and **doctrinal** posture.

This work exemplifies Kelsey’s enduring concerns: a theologically disciplined account of divine **agency**, a refusal to force doctrinal harmony where **mystery** is warranted, and a pastoral turn that never loosens its grip on **Scripture’s canon**. The book recapitulates his anthropological point: human beings are those whose lives are defined by God’s relations with them, relations whose power is revealed in cruciform **mercy** and eschatological **promise** rather than in naked control. The upshot is a normatively constraining yet liberating vision for theological speech in the face of **anguish**.

#### 8. Dialogues and differentiations: Barth, Aquinas, Calvin, and the moderns
Across his corpus Kelsey maintains a distinctive posture vis-a-vis classic and modern interlocutors. From **Barth** he takes the primacy of **revelation** and a deep suspicion of **natural theology** as a basis for anthropology. From **Aquinas** he learns the disciplined habits of **doctrinal reasoning**, yet he refracts Thomist metaphysics through a canonical lens that prioritizes **economy** over *ad intra* speculation. From **Calvin** he receives the **coram Deo** orientation that centers human life in **God’s glory** and **providence**, as well as a sense for Scripture’s comprehensive authority over doctrine and life. With **Frei** and **Lindbeck** he shares a conviction that Scripture’s **narrative** and the church’s **linguistic** practices shape Christian rationality. Against **Tillich** and **Tracy** he is wary of correlation that absorbs the gospel into public reason, yet he welcomes **Toulmin’s** reminder that rational warrants may be disciplined without pretense to universal foundations.

In light of these dialogues, Kelsey’s constructive judgments can be summarized. He privileges **canonical construal** over metaphysical theory, pursues **wisdom** over system-building, and refuses to isolate **anthropology** from **soteriology** and **eschatology**. He trims claims about **imago Dei**, **nature**, and **law** to what Scripture warrants, and he expands accountings of **embodiment** and **community** to match canonical breadth. The costs and gains of this posture are clear: theology gains humility and pastoral traction, but at the risk of underdeveloping **natural law** resources and thinning its metaphysical architecture. Kelsey knows these risks and accepts them, trusting the **canon** to carry the weight that scholastic systems once bore.

#### 9. Structure, coherence, and the moral life
One of Kelsey’s abiding concerns is coherence across loci without reduction. He labors to show how **creation**, **reconciliation**, and **consummation** coherently shape accounts of ethical goods like **justice**, **friendship**, and **care for the vulnerable**. Moral discernment is not derived from an abstract **imago** concept or generic virtue ethics, but from descriptions of how God’s **triune relating** orders common life: the **Creator’s** blessing mandates stewardship and gratitude; the **Reconciler’s** grace mandates forgiveness and truth-telling; the **Consummator’s** promise mandates patience and protest against powers that deny eschatological hope. This triune-shaped ethic resists both legalism and antinomianism by rooting obligation in **God’s character** as revealed scripturally.

Kelsey’s descriptions of the moral life are thickly ecclesial and world-facing. He insists that **worship** and **catechesis** are laboratories of perception where Christians learn to see the world under the aspect of **creation** and **promise**. Yet his account intentionally interfaces with the **social sciences**, medicine, and law, confident that **providence** renders the world intelligible without collapsing theological judgments into empirical ones. The coherence he seeks is not architectonic but sapiential: a wise fittingness of **doctrine**, **practice**, and **prayer** under the direction of **Scripture** and for the sake of truthful speech about **God**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: gains, losses, and proposals
From a confessional **Reformed** and WTS-style vantage, Kelsey’s work is both richly resonant and provocatively incomplete. Positively, his **theocentric** anthropology echoes **Calvin’s coram Deo**, his insistence that theology’s subject matter governs method aligns with **Barth’s** safeguard of **revelation**, and his **canonical** discipline coheres with **redemptive-historical** reading prized by **Vos** and **Machen**. His triune framing of **creation**, **reconciliation**, and **consummation** fits the **covenantal** storyline, and his refusal of speculative **theodicy** honors the Creator-creature distinction fundamental to **divine simplicity** and **providence**. Yet tensions arise. First, Kelsey’s non-foundationalist and **cultural-linguistic** posture risks softening the **propositional truth** claims and **inerrancy** commitments central to classical Reformed bibliology, even as he rigorously attends to the **canon’s** grammar. Second, by decentering **imago Dei** as a controlling fulcrum and by declining strong **natural law** claims, he leaves underdeveloped the Reformed tradition’s use of creation order for **public theology** and **ethics**. Third, in **Imagining Redemption** the preference for descriptive plural images may attenuate the juridical clarity of **penal substitution**, **imputation**, and federal **headship** that articulate reconciliation’s forensic depth. Finally, his anthropology, though materially covenantal in structure, rarely thematizes **covenant** as the integrating doctrine that binds **history**, **nature**, and **grace** within a robust **law-gospel** economy. A Reformed proposal would receive Kelsey’s **eccentric existence** as a salutary triune orientation, then deepen it by explicit **covenant theology**, sharpen soteriological grammar with **justification by faith** and **union with Christ**, and secure canonical authority with a clear account of **Scripture’s infallibility** as well as its narrative shape. Such integration would preserve Kelsey’s wisdom-driven, canonical specificity while anchoring it more explicitly in the doctrinal architecture of **Reformed orthodoxy**.
