### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
N. Katherine Hayles emerges as a theorist of the late modern West, trained in the crucible of **poststructuralism** and the intellectual aftershocks of **cybernetics**. Her career develops as the academy pivots from **print culture** to **digital media**, and as the Cold War legacies of **information theory** migrate into everyday life. Hayles becomes a leading voice in **literature and science** studies and a central architect of **critical posthumanism**, seeking to resist fantasies of disembodied mind by insisting on the primacy of **embodiment**. Methodologically she moves fluidly among **close readings** of novels and technical documents, **genealogies** of scientific concepts, and **media-theoretical** analyses of platforms and interfaces. Across her corpus, Hayles pursues a coherent project: to show how the category of **information** was abstracted from **materiality**, and to reconstruct a vision of **human and nonhuman cognition** as distributed, **embodied**, and historically situated.

This formation places Hayles at the convergence of three streams: the **Macy Conferences** on cybernetics, the **French theory** inheritance of **Derrida** and **Foucault**, and the emergence of **digital humanities**. From **Norbert Wiener** and **Claude Shannon** she inherits a story about feedback, control, and signal-noise dynamics; from **poststructuralism** she receives suspicion of metaphysical presence and an attunement to textual play; from **media studies** she gains tools for analyzing **interfaces** and **platforms** as formative environments. Yet her distinctive contribution is a materialist correction: whereas cybernetic discourse often valorized **pattern** over **presence**, she argues that bodies are not dispensable carriers but constitutive of **meaning**, **affect**, and **cognition**. She narrates her method as a traversal of **material-semiotic** networks, bringing **literature**, **science**, and **technology** into one analytic field.

#### 2. Early work: chaos, postmodernism, and the migration of theories
Hayles first gains prominence with **Chaos Bound: Orderly Disorder in Contemporary Literature and Science** in 1990, where she tracks how **chaos theory** transforms the imaginaries of both **science** and **literature**. The book performs a double hermeneutic: literary texts absorb scientific tropes, while scientific discourses employ **narrative** and **metaphor**. In **Chaos Bound**, Hayles shows how ideas like **strange attractors**, **nonlinearity**, and **self-similarity** inflect postmodern fiction, relocating **order** and **disorder** within dynamic systems rather than static essences. The key claim is not that literature is science, but that both are embedded in **cultural formations** where **conceptual migrations** reshape public rationality. This early work already displays her enduring thesis: the necessity of reading **scientific concepts** historically, rhetorically, and materially, against the lure of timeless **abstractions**.

The early essays leading into the 1990s, including the influential **Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers** in 1993, further elaborate the critique of disembodied **signification**. Hayles coins the term **flickering signifier** to describe how digital encoding dissolves stable meanings into mutable **code streams**, moving from **print-era** signifiers to computational ones. Against the presumption that **code** transparently controls **material** outputs, she insists that molten layers of **hardware**, **software**, and **wetware** mediate any sign. This vocabulary sets the stage for a larger critique of rationalist **presence** and for reframing **subjectivity** as mediated by technological ecologies.

#### 3. The central work: How We Became Posthuman
The pivot comes with **How We Became Posthuman** in 1999. Hayles reconstructs the mid-century story in which **information** is abstracted from **material instantiation**, culminating in a vision of mind as a **pattern** that can be uploaded, copied, or migrated. She analyzes **Wiener**, **Shannon**, **Turing**, and the **Macy Conferences**, showing how the control of **noise**, the emphasis on **signal-to-noise ratios**, and the ideal of **pattern preservation** generated cultural fantasies of immortality through **digital encoding**. She terms this ideology a posthuman imaginary that privileges **pattern/randomness** over **presence/absence**, destabilizing the **liberal humanist subject** while also opening the door to disembodied **mind**.

Hayles counters with the program of **embodied virtuality**. She redefines the **posthuman** not as the erasure of the human but as the recognition that cognition is an emergent property of **distributed cognitive systems** that always include **bodies**, **tools**, and **environments**. She argues that human being is best understood as a **dynamic prosthetic coupling** of organism and artifact, and that the dream of pure **information** is a metaphysical mistake. The book concludes with a double critique: against **technological transcendence** and against nostalgic **humanism**. In their place she advances a materialist, relational **anthropology** grounded in the entanglement of biological and computational forms.

#### 4. Media-specific analysis and the poetics of code
With **Writing Machines** in 2002 and **My Mother Was a Computer** in 2005, Hayles turns from conceptual genealogy to **media-specific analysis**. She argues that genres and interpretation change when the **substrate** changes. The physical affordances of **print**, **code**, and **screen** are not neutral carriers but shape **narrative**, **memory**, and **attention**. She coins the term **media-specific analysis** to direct critics to the material constraints and possibilities of different **platforms**, and she introduces the idea of the **cognisphere** to describe the planetary mesh of human and machine **cognition**. The titular claim that **my mother was a computer** is a provocation to notice how **procedural logics** serve as a deep cultural grammar informing **subjectivity** and **ethics**.

In these works, Hayles also revisits **code** as a layered semiotics. She explores how **markup languages**, **programming paradigms**, and **hardware architectures** bear meanings irreducible to natural language. The upshot is both methodological and ontological: interpretation must learn to read **codework**, and the human must be reimagined within **assemblages** where agency is co-constituted by technical actors. This deepens her earlier challenge to **Cartesian dualism** by showing that cognition is co-authored by **inscription systems** and **embodied agents**.

#### 5. Cognition, technogenesis, and the nonconscious
In **How We Think** in 2012, Hayles formulates **technogenesis**, the mutual co-evolution of **humans** and **technologies** at the level of **habitus**, **neural plasticity**, and **cultural practice**. She contends that digital media reorganize **attention**, **memory**, and **reading** practices, producing new cognitive styles. Rather than lamenting or celebrating, she urges the **digital humanities** to embrace **comparative media** training that integrates **hyper attention** and **deep attention**. The underlying anthropology proposes a dynamic **embodied mind** that is never without its technical environment, reframing education as the curation of **cognitive ecologies** rather than the transmission of stable **contents**.

With **Unthought: The Power of the Cognitive Nonconscious** in 2017, Hayles extends this model by emphasizing **nonconscious cognition**. She argues that cognition is not exhausted by reflective **consciousness**. Instead, complex systems of **humans**, **animals**, and **technical devices** carry out adaptive inferences and information processing beneath the threshold of awareness. She develops the concept of **cognitive assemblages** to name networks in which **human** and **nonhuman** agencies intertwine, and in which **technical systems** can be said to have cognitive capacities without attributing **consciousness** or **intentionality** in the human sense. This is offered as a middle path between anthropocentrism and the overreach of **strong AI** claims, relocating agency in distributed **material processes**.

#### 6. Postprint and the ecology of texts
In **Postprint** in 2021, Hayles returns to the changing life of **books** in an environment where **print**, **screen**, and **network** interpenetrate. She describes an ecology in which **codex** and **database**, **algorithm** and **author**, **archive** and **interface** co-constitute what a text is and does. The argument stabilizes her long-standing themes: mediation is ontologically basic, **material substrates** matter, and the human is a node in a wider **cognisphere**. The postprint world intensifies the earlier dynamics of **flickering signifiers**, yet it also invites renewed attention to the **body** as reading becomes a choreography of eyes, hands, and devices across varied **interfaces**.

Here Hayles updates her **media-specific analysis** for a platform capitalist present marked by **algorithms**, **recommendation engines**, and **surveillance infrastructures**. Ethical reflection on reading becomes inseparable from critique of **sociotechnical systems** that shape **desire**, **attention**, and **knowledge**. Thus her literary-theoretical method yields a practical cultural hermeneutic for navigating power in **digital modernity**, resisting the gravitational pull toward disembodied **datafication**.

#### 7. Theological bearings: anthropology, embodiment, and mediation
Although not a theologian, Hayles occupies a crucial place in contemporary **theological anthropology** because her work interrogates the very assumptions of **personhood**, **embodiment**, and **mediation** that underwrite doctrines such as the **imago Dei** and the **incarnation**. Her critique of disembodied **information** resonates with classical Christian commitments to **fleshly life**, whether in **Augustine's** insistence on **memoria** as embodied or in **Aquinas's** **hylomorphism** that refuses **Cartesian** splits. Her concept of **embodied virtuality** challenges any Christian accommodation to **Gnostic** dreams of salvation as escape into pure **spirit** or **data**, pressing toward a Christian defense of **creational goodness** and the sacramental density of **material signs**.

Hayles also destabilizes a complacent **anthropocentrism** by mapping **distributed cognition** and **cognitive assemblages**. For theology this raises questions about **agency**, **responsibility**, and **sin** within networked systems. If agency is distributed across **human** and **technical actors**, the moral life requires an account of **structures**, **practices**, and **designs** that aligns with Christian analyses of **powers and principalities**. Her account of **technogenesis** invites a theological reinterpretation of the **cultural mandate**, suggesting that human making reshapes not only the world but the **mind** that perceives the world. In this light, pedagogy and spiritual formation appear as curations of **attention** and **habitus** within complex **media ecologies**.

#### 8. Interlocutors and polemics
Hayles positions herself against both exuberant **transhumanism** and nostalgic **humanism**. Against **transhumanism** she argues that celebrating mind as **information** not only misunderstands **materiality** but risks unjust hierarchies of the **enhanced** over the **merely biological**. Against nostalgic humanism she critiques the **liberal subject** as a fiction that ignores the constitutive roles of **technics**, **affect**, and **environment**. In dialogue with **Donna Haraway's** **cyborg** manifesto, she retains the cyborgian insight that boundaries are porous while insisting that **embodiment** and **mortality** are not accidents but ground. In conversation with **Bruno Latour's** **actor-network theory**, she affirms the agency of **nonhumans** while preserving a qualitative difference between **cognition** and **consciousness**.

This triangulation separates her as well from strong **computationalism** in cognitive science, which reduces **mind** to formal **computation**, and from certain strands of **new materialism** that risk dissolving **meaning** into blind **vitality**. Her insistence on layered **semiotics** and **material substrates** maps a middle lane where **texts**, **codes**, and **bodies** co-produce significance. The polemical force of her project lies in re-educating desire away from the aesthetics of **uploading** and toward the craft of inhabiting **finite**, **contingent**, and technologically mediated **embodiment**.

#### 9. Conceptual tools and their theological purchase
Three conceptual tools stand out. First, **flickering signifier** names the instability of meaning in computational environments, a tool that can help theologians analyze **digital liturgies**, **online catechesis**, and the shift from **canon** to **feed**. Second, **technogenesis** reframes Christian debates about **formation**, **habitus**, and **sanctification** by acknowledging that media ecologies alter **attention** and **memory**, thus interacting with practices of **prayer**, **Scripture reading**, and **preaching**. Third, **nonconscious cognition** expands the field of **agency** to include operations below awareness, which aligns with premodern accounts of **habit** and **virtue** and with Augustinian recognition of the **heart** as a subterranean matrix of **love**.

These tools also recalibrate how we think of **sacramentality**. If **material substrates** shape meaning, then the **signs** of water, bread, and wine are not arbitrary pointers but densely **mediated** vehicles whose efficacy depends on embodied **practices** within communal **assemblages**. Conversely, the rise of **algorithmic mediation** cautions against presuming that sacramental life is readily transferable to **virtual space** without loss. Hayles thus provides a grammar for discerning where **digital affordances** assist or deform **ecclesial** life, calling for discriminating attention to **form**, **medium**, and **embodiment**.

#### 10. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and Westminster Theological Seminary orientation, Hayles offers salutary corrections and also invites principled critique. Positively, her defense of **embodiment** against disembodied **information** coheres with **Reformed anthropology** that resists **Cartesian dualism**, affirms the **goodness of creation**, and locates human identity in covenantal **bodiliness** under **providence**. Her analyses of **media ecologies** help Reformed theology refine accounts of **means of grace**, **Scripture reading**, and **catechesis** within changing **technological** settings. Her focus on **distributed cognition** aids a robust doctrine of **structure and direction**, distinguishing the creational structures of **technics** from their idolatrous or redemptive **uses**.

Yet several tensions remain. First, Hayles’s ontology, while rejecting disembodied **information**, tends toward **immanentism** and a flattening of **teleology**, lacking the **eschatological** horizon that orients **Reformed** accounts of human making toward **Sabbath rest** and **new creation**. Second, her depiction of **cognitive assemblages** risks evacuating personal **agency** and **moral responsibility** into systemic flows, whereas **covenantal** theology insists on analogical personalism rooted in **imago Dei** and clarified by **law** and **gospel**. Third, by construing **meaning** as emergent from **material-semiotic** couplings without normative **revelation**, she cannot finally adjudicate between rival **liturgies** of technology, while **Reformed epistemology** orders all knowledge **coram Deo** by **Scripture’s** sufficiency and clarity. A constructive alternative is a covenantal, cruciform **posthumanism** that affirms Hayles’s **embodied virtuality**, but locates human dignity in **union with Christ** rather than in **cognitive capacity**, interprets **technogenesis** within a doctrine of **vocation** and **common grace**, and subjects **media ecologies** to the lordship of **Christ the King** who speaks in and through creaturely **means**.
