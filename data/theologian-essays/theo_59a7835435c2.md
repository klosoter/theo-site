### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and methodological stance
John H. Walton emerges as a leading contemporary **evangelical** Old Testament theologian whose career spans the culture wars over **creation and evolution** and the academic renaissance of **Ancient Near Eastern studies**. Educated in Hebrew and cognate languages with a PhD from **Hebrew Union College** in 1981, his early formation ran through the conservative classroom at **Moody Bible Institute** where he taught for two decades, before moving in 2001 to **Wheaton College** as Professor of **Old Testament**. The mid- to late twentieth century saw the consolidation of **comparative Semitics**, the accessibility of the **Enuma Elish**, **Atrahasis**, and other **ANET** materials, and a burgeoning conversation on **divine accommodation** vis-a-vis modern science. Walton's mature work situates itself squarely in that stream, insisting that the Bible's authority is accessed by recovering the **cognitive environment** of its first communicative context.

Walton's governing method is **comparative contextualization** anchored in the notion of a shared **cognitive environment** among ancient readers, combined with **speech-act theory** for understanding **biblical authority**. For him, authorial **illocution** and audience **uptake** in a **high-context communication** setting determine the **assertion** content to which **inerrancy** properly applies. He rejects **concordism** that seeks modern **scientific** affirmation in biblical texts and commends a robust **divine accommodation** whereby God speaks in the idioms and conceptual furniture of the **Ancient Near East**. This method governs his reading of **cosmology**, **anthropology**, and **law** and functions as a hermeneutical platform for retriaging evangelical debates over **origins**.

Early scholarly efforts, notably **Ancient Israelite Literature in Its Cultural Context** (1989) and the later **Ancient Near Eastern Thought and the Old Testament** (2006; 2nd ed. 2018), established Walton's framework: the Old Testament participates in a common **cosmic geography** and **temple ideology** with its neighbors while rendering a distinctive **Yahwistic theology**. These works catalog parallels and contrasts in **cosmology**, **divine council**, **kingship**, and **wisdom**, setting up the methodological claim that Israel's Scripture must be read along the river of **cultural discourse** rather than against it. The editorial oversight of the **NIV Cultural Backgrounds Study Bible** (2016) and his long-standing role in **Bible translation and study resources** operationalize this commitment for the church, placing **ANE backgrounds** alongside the text to reframe expectations about **genre**, **reference**, and **function**.

#### 2. Genesis 1 and the doctrine of creation: functional ontology and cosmic temple
Walton's signature contribution is the proposal of a **functional ontology** in **Genesis 1**, articulated programmatically in **The Lost World of Genesis One** (2009) and defended in **Genesis 1 as Ancient Cosmology** (2011). He contends that in the **Ancient Near Eastern** world, the concept of existence is not primarily **material** but **functional** within an ordered system; to bring something into being is to assign **roles** and **relationships** within a cosmic economy. On this reading, the seven days narrate not the material manufacture of the cosmos but its **functional inauguration** as a **cosmic temple**, climaxing in **divine rest** understood as taking up **royal residence** and **rule**. In this scheme, **Sabbath** signifies enthronement rather than recuperation, and the imago Dei articulates representative **vicegerency** tasked with sustaining **order** in sacred space.

This construal makes room to affirm **creatio ex nihilo** as Christian doctrine on the basis of **John 1**, **Colossians 1**, and **Hebrews 11**, while acknowledging that **Genesis 1** does not itself aim to teach **material origins**. Walton's strategy of separating **doctrinal synthesis** from **textual illocution** protects **biblical authority** by refusing to conscript the text into alien **scientific** agendas. His constant refrain is that to decontextualize is to deauthorize; true **inerrancy** attaches to what the **human and divine authors** actually assert in their **cognitive environment**. This also reframes debates over **day-age**, **young-earth**, and **old-earth** positions, redirecting the conversation from chronology to **liturgical-temple teleology**.

At key points, Walton aligns Genesis with extrabiblical **temple inauguration** texts, **royal building inscriptions**, and **cosmic geography** tropes that associate creation with **house of the god** ideals. He argues that the arrangement and function of lights, waters, and land serve the establishment of **sacred order** under Yahweh's kingship, not the reporting of hydrology or astrophysics. The visible implications for Christian theology of **creation** are considerable: the world is sacred space oriented to **divine presence**, true rest is **theocratic governance**, and **Sabbath** is the ritual sign of **cosmic rule**. This has cascading effects on **ecclesiology** and **ethics**, implicating human **priestly vocation** in the maintenance of order, justice, and worship within God's **cosmic temple**.

#### 3. Adam, archetype, and sin: reading Genesis 2–3 in its ancient frame
In **The Lost World of Adam and Eve** (2015), Walton extends the functional, temple-oriented reading to **Genesis 2–3**, advancing the categories of **archetype** and **sacred-space priesthood**. He maintains that **Adam and Eve** can be affirmed as historical persons, yet the text's primary **illocution** concerns humanity as a class. The **dust** and **rib** are **archetypal** markers of mortality and relational identity rather than biological materials, and the Garden functions as a **sanctuary** where Adam serves as a **priest**. The sin of Genesis 3 is read not as a material ingestion that changes human biology but as a breach of **divine order** in sacred space, entailing exile from **presence** and frustration of **vocation**.

Walton integrates **Pauline** texts like **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** by positing that **federal headship** and **representative sin** can be historically true without requiring **Adam** to be the sole **genetic progenitor** of humanity. He is open to **evolutionary creation**, suggesting that God may have elected a pair or a community to **priestly office**, whose disobedience implicated those they represented, a model akin to **royal grant** and **covenantal headship** patterns in the **Ancient Near East**. The **imago Dei** is thus more vocational than ontological, tied to humanity's role in the **cosmic temple**. Walton resists readings of **Genesis** that load the text with **biology** and **genetics**, arguing instead that the doctrine of **original sin** should be articulated theologically from the canon's **covenantal** and **federal** logic rather than by squeezing it from **ancient narrative** that had different **communicative aims**.

Critics from within **evangelical** and **Reformed** communities note the stakes: the coherence of **imputation**, **historicity**, and **redemptive history**. Walton responds by reiterating **speech-act** commitments: the **truth-value** subject to **inerrancy** is the **illocutionary** content determined by authorial intent in the ancient **cognitive environment**, and this content does not specify **biological mechanisms**. The role of **Adam** as **archetypal priest-king**, the nature of the **curse**, and the patterns of **exile and return** are coordinated with later **temple** and **Christological** fulfillment, yielding a reading that foregrounds **sacred space** over **scientific** concerns and that privileges **canonical theology** over **modernist harmonization**.

#### 4. Flood, Torah, prophets: reframing genres and functions
In **The Lost World of the Flood** (2018) with **Tremper Longman**, Walton reads **Genesis 6–9** against the background of **Mesopotamian flood traditions**, especially **Atrahasis** and the **Epic of Gilgamesh**, and argues that the biblical account is not a modern **geological report** but a **theological narrative** employing **hyperbolic universality** common in **ANE** rhetoric. The flood functions as **de-creation** and **re-creation** within the **cosmic temple** storyline, dramatizing the crisis of **disorder** and the reestablishment of **order** under Yahweh. The authors leave open a **regional flood** hypothesis for the historical event while insisting that **genre** constrains expectations about **precision** and **scope**. This reorientation aims to preserve **biblical authority** while disengaging the text from debates alien to its **literary** and **cultural** character.

With J. Harvey Walton, **The Lost World of the Torah** (2019) proposes that **Torah** is not primarily **legislation** in a modern **statutory** sense but **instructional wisdom** that orders **sacred space** and **covenant life**. The law codes are exemplars and paradigms, not exhaustive regulations; their **function** is formative, shaping **identity** and **order** under the presence of God. In this account, **holiness** is about **cosmic order** as much as about moral transgression, and the **clean/unclean** distinctions cultivate an **ordered cosmos** symbolically. Walton argues that the **law** aims to produce a community fit for **divine residence**, which reframes discussions of **theonomy**, **civil law**, and **moral application**. He correlates this with **Near Eastern treaty** forms and **royal wisdom**, thereby accenting **covenant** and **kingdom** over positivistic **legalism**.

In **The Lost World of the Prophets** (2023), Walton advances a definition of **prophecy** as **covenant prosecution** rather than primarily **prediction**. Prophets speak into concrete **historical** situations, invoking the **covenant** to call Israel back to **order** within **sacred space**. Predictive elements serve the larger **rhetorical** and **pastoral** aims of exhortation, warning, and hope. Apocalyptic imagery functions as **resistance literature** using **cosmic symbolism** rather than detailed **chronology**. In each case, the focus is on **illocutionary force** and **function**. Prophetic texts thus locate **eschatology** within the overarching **temple** and **kingdom** schema, culminating in **Christ** as the locus of **divine presence**.

#### 5. Scripture and authority: speech-act theory, orality, and canon
Walton's doctrine of Scripture becomes explicit in **The Lost World of Scripture** (2013) with **Brent Sandy**, where he applies **speech-act theory** to the phenomena of **orality** and textualization in the ancient world. They argue that much biblical material lived long in **oral performance** before textual fixation, and that **authority** properly attaches not only to written **locutions** but to the **illocutions** intended by God and human authors for their original **audiences**. This analysis yields a thick account of **inerrancy** as the faithful achievement of **communicative intent** in a **high-context** culture. The Bible's truthfulness does not require modern **precision** or **scientific concordism**, but it does demand careful attention to **genre**, **traditioning processes**, and **audience competence**.

This approach frames **canon** as a divinely guided collection of **speech acts**, unified by **covenant** and **temple** themes, whose authority demands robust **exegesis** sensitive to the **cognitive environment**. Walton frequently cites **James Barr** on the dangers of illegitimate **totality transfer** in **word studies**, underscoring the semantic discipline required by his method. His exegetical work on **Job** in the **NIV Application Commentary** (2012) exhibits this method in practice: **wisdom** mediates between **cosmic order** and human suffering, and **divine speeches** assert **creational governance** rather than disclose hidden **mechanisms**. Throughout, Walton's theology of Scripture seeks to preserve **perspicuity** within the horizons of **ancient communication**, inviting modern readers into the Bible's **world** rather than projecting our **world** onto the Bible.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and reception
Walton's theses have generated sustained debate within **evangelical** and **Reformed** circles, as well as engagement with the broader **philosophical theology** of origins. **C. John Collins** critiques aspects of Walton's **functional ontology** while sharing a **literary** sensibility about **Genesis**, arguing for an analogical-day model that preserves **historical** features. **William Lane Craig** presses the question of a **historical Adam**, proposing a **de novo** Homo heidelbergensis model in tension with Walton's **archetypal emphasis**. **Vern Poythress** from a **Westminster** tradition questions Walton's use of **ANE parallels** and the implied recalibration of **inerrancy**, defending a stronger degree of **historical reference** in **Genesis** and emphasizing **tri-perspectival** coherence.

On the other side, **Tremper Longman** and scholars associated with **BioLogos** find Walton's **accommodation** and **functional ontology** a salutary pathway for **science-faith** integrity. Among **young-earth creationists**, **Ken Ham** and colleagues reject Walton's program as capitulation to **naturalism** and a denial of **biblical clarity**, charges Walton rebuts by distinguishing **hermeneutics** from **scientific** accommodation and by insisting on **authorial intent**. Within ANE studies, Walton's correlation of **temple ideology** and **cosmology** draws on and contributes to work by **K. A. Kitchen**, **Richard Averbeck**, and comparative literature scholars, though debates continue over the specificity and sufficiency of **parallels** for constraining **Genesis**.

Notably, Walton maintains that his view secures the **authority of Scripture** by limiting claims to the text's **illocution**, thereby avoiding both **concordist** anachronism and **skeptical** reduction. He positions his program as a theological middle way: fully **orthodox** in affirming **creatio ex nihilo**, **fall**, **sin**, and **atonement**, while exegetically cautious in delimiting what **Genesis** asserts. The enthusiastic reception of the **Lost World** series, alongside critiques from **classical Reformed** and **fundamentalist** quarters, shows that Walton has become a key node in contemporary discussions of **hermeneutics**, **cosmology**, and **doctrine of Scripture**.

#### 7. Doctrinal payoffs and constructive trajectories
The constructive implications of Walton's work extend beyond **origins** into a broader biblical theology of **sacred space**, **kingdom**, and **human vocation**. The **cosmic temple** motif orders **creation** and **redemption**, situating **Christ** as the true **Immanuel** who fulfills **tabernacle** and **temple**, inaugurates eschatological **Sabbath**, and constitutes the church as **Spirit-indwelt** sacred space. This coheres with **covenant theology** that reads **creation** and **consummation** along a single **sacred-history** trajectory. Walton's emphasis on **function** rather than **material** explains why **new creation** language is about reordered **relationships**, **presence**, and **glory** more than about **mechanism**, a point congenial to **Augustinian** and **Reformed** accounts of **ordo** and **shalom**.

In ethics and public theology, the idea of **Torah as wisdom for order** guides Christian engagement with **law** today: the goal is not repristination of **case laws** but the cultivation of **ordered communities** where **God's presence** can be manifest. The redefinition of **prophetic** discourse as **covenant prosecution** equips the church to hear **judgment and hope** as calls to renewed **vocation** rather than as coded **timelines**. Walton's approach also offers a pedagogy for **Scripture** in the university, where the gap between ancient and modern **cognitive environments** must be bridged without sacrificing **authority**. His synthesis models a **missional** hermeneutic that welcomes **general revelation** in the form of cultural data while preserving **special revelation** in the form of **authoritative speech acts**.

#### 8. Integrated Reformed/WTS evaluation
From a **Reformed** and **Westminster** vantage, Walton's retrieval of **divine accommodation**, his centering of **covenant** and **temple**, and his refusal of **scientific concordism** are genuine gifts to **evangelical** hermeneutics. His stress on **authorial intent** and **genre** supports the **grammatico-historical** method, and his **cosmic temple** vision resonates with **Reformed biblical theology** from **creation** to **consummation**. Nevertheless, tensions arise at key doctrinal joints. First, on **Scripture**, the **speech-act** delimitation of **inerrancy** to **illocution** risks functionally marginalizing the Bible's **historical claims** where those claims are the very media of **covenant history**; **Westminster** insists that God reveals himself in history and that **historicity** often belongs to what Scripture asserts. Second, on **anthropology** and **hamartiology**, the **archetypal Adam** model may attenuate **federal headship**, **imputation**, and **original sin** as confessed in **Reformed orthodoxy** if the historical singularity of **Adam** as first man is surrendered; here the exegesis of **Romans 5** and **1 Corinthians 15** places heavier weight on historical sequence than Walton's reconstruction allows. Third, on **law**, describing **Torah** chiefly as **wisdom for order** may underplay the abiding **moral law** and its **threefold use**, central to **Reformed** ethics, even as it helpfully resists **statutory positivism**. A constructive alternative is to appropriate Walton's **ANE-sensitive** exegesis within a thicker doctrine of **special revelation**, affirming both the **cosmic temple** and **functional ontology** insights while safeguarding the **historical Adam**, a robust **covenant of works** and **grace**, and an **inerrancy** that encompasses not only **illocutionary force** but also the factual **assertions** embedded in redemptive **history**.
