### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Scott Hahn, born in 1957 and received into full communion with the Roman Catholic Church in 1986, emerged within the late twentieth-century ferment that followed **Vatican II**, especially the biblical renewal announced in **Dei Verbum**. His early training in evangelical and Reformed settings at **Grove City College** and **Gordon-Conwell** introduced him to **Reformed covenant theology** and the redemptive-historical legacy of **Geerhardus Vos** and **Meredith Kline**, which became seeds for his later Catholic synthesis. After completing a PhD in theology at **Marquette University** in 1995, Hahn took up a long career at **Franciscan University of Steubenville** and founded the **St. Paul Center for Biblical Theology** in 2001. The institutional setting of Steubenville, the papal magisterium of **John Paul II** and **Benedict XVI**, and the ressourcement turn to **Augustine** and **Aquinas** formed a context in which Hahn could propose a fresh Catholic biblical theology. His project contends that **covenant as kinship**, **sacrament**, and **liturgy** provide the unifying grammar of Scripture and that the **rule of faith** is the rightful guide of exegesis.

Hahn’s signature claim is methodological. The Bible is read canonically, ecclesially, and liturgically, where **typology** unfolds within the **literal sense** and is normed by the **creed** and **tradition**. He consistently invokes the patristic nexus of **letter and spirit**, arguing that *lectio* in the Church’s *leitourgia* is the original interpretive environment of revelation. Relying on **Dei Verbum 12**, he treats the spiritual senses as ordered to the **literal sense** and controlled by the **analogia fidei**, a stance he draws from **Thomas Aquinas** and **Augustine**. The polemical edge of this method appears in his critique of **historical-critical reductionism**, especially in **Politicizing the Bible** 2012, where the hermeneutics of **Spinoza** and **Hobbes** are cast as engines of skepticism that sever Scripture from the **Church** and the **liturgy**. Hahn’s constructive alternative is a Catholic biblical theology in which **covenant**, **temple**, and **kingdom** converge to yield doctrine.

#### 2. Covenant as kinship and sacrament as oath
The engine of Hahn’s theology is the thesis of **covenant as kinship**, developed popularly in **A Father Who Keeps His Promises** 1998 and formally in **Kinship by Covenant** 2009. Drawing on biblical philology of **berith**, ancient Near Eastern treaty forms, and the pattern of oaths and meals, Hahn argues that a covenant is not merely a contract but a sacred bond that creates family. The Five Covenant schema across **Adam**, **Noah**, **Abraham**, **Moses**, and **David** climax in the **New Covenant** as universal kinship in Christ. The associated sacramental proposal appears in **Swear to God** 2004, where **sacramentum** is read as oath sworn into God’s family. Hahn treats the sacraments as covenant oaths that both signify and effect incorporation by grace, an Augustinian and Thomist **ex opere operato** causality now illuminated by oath and meal.

This covenantal sacramentalism refracts classic Catholic loci through biblical patterns. **Baptism** is new birth into the divine household, **Eucharist** is covenant meal and memorial, **Penance** is covenant lawsuit and restoration. Hahn’s retrieval of **Irenaeus’s recapitulation** and **Augustine’s totus Christus** portrays Christ as the head who remakes the human family as the **Church**. His adaptation of **Reformed covenant theology** is explicit, yet he reconfigures it within **sacramental realism** and **episcopal** succession, claiming the unity of Scripture from creation to Church is best understood as a familial polity. The result is a grammar where **oath**, **kinship**, and **liturgy** are cohering categories rather than analogies.

#### 3. Liturgy, Eucharist, and the Passover of the New Covenant
In **The Lamb’s Supper** 1999 and **The Fourth Cup** 2018, Hahn advances his most famous liturgical biblical theology. He contends that the **Eucharist** consummates the **Passover** and that the **Book of Revelation** is a liturgy-shaped apocalypse unveiling the heavenly **Temple**. The Fourth Cup thesis proposes that Jesus intentionally delays the final Passover cup until the Cross, joining Psalm 22, the sour wine, and the cry It is finished, thereby completing the Passover and instituting the **New Covenant** in his blood. This interweaves **typology** with sacramental realism, presenting *anamnēsis* as more than recollection. It is covenant re-presentation in which the faithful share the once-for-all sacrifice of Christ in a noncompetitive mode.

Hahn’s liturgical hermeneutic is a complex of **temple theology**, **Davidic worship**, and patristic insights from **Justin Martyr** to **Aquinas**. He reads **Luke 22** and **1 Corinthians 10–11** through the lens of covenant oath and meal, pressing the unity of Scripture by showing how the **Mass** is both the memorial of the Cross and the foretaste of the **marriage supper of the Lamb**. Theologically, this supports Catholic claims about the **real presence**, **sacrificial language**, and the role of the **priesthood**, which he defends for a popular audience in **Many Are Called** 2010. The Eucharist becomes the hermeneutical key by which canon and creed are read together.

#### 4. Ecclesiology, kingdom, and the Petrine office
Hahn’s ecclesiology centers on **Davidic kingdom** typology. Building on **Matthew 16** and **Isaiah 22**, he argues that the **keys** given to **Peter** signify the prime ministerial office in the restored kingdom of David. The Church is thus the eschatological household ruled by the Son of David, with a steward who binds and looses. The **magisterium** is framed as covenantal governance for the sake of unity in truth and charity. Hahn develops this through **Reasons to Believe** and his commentaries, but the clearest theological rationale appears in **Covenant and Communion** 2009, his study of **Joseph Ratzinger**. He finds in Benedict’s thought a model of **canonical exegesis**, **liturgy**, and **Christology** that grounds papal ministry in service to revelation as received in Scripture and Tradition.

This **Davidic** framing extends to the **Temple-Church** identification, where **Acts** and **Revelation** display the Church as a priestly people. The sacramental priesthood functions within this polity as an instrument of covenant holiness. Hahn’s narrative from **Adam** to **Christ** yields an ecclesiology in which **apostolic succession** is continuity of familial governance rather than mere institutional power. The **Church** becomes Israel fulfilled, not replaced, a motif that softens supersessionism by emphasizing fulfillment through **covenant** and **liturgy**.

#### 5. Marian doctrine through biblical typology
In **Hail, Holy Queen** 2001, Hahn advances a Marian theology grounded in **typology** rather than bare proof-texting. Mary is read as **New Eve**, **Ark of the Covenant**, and **Gebirah** or Queen Mother in the **Davidic kingdom**, with particular focus on **Luke 1–2**, **John 2 and 19**, and **Revelation 12**. The **Immaculate Conception** and **Assumption** are interpreted through a logic of fittingness and covenant purity, where Mary embodies the sanctified Israel from whom the Messiah comes and in whom the new creation is inaugurated. The **Magnificat** becomes a charter of covenant reversal and filial piety. Hahn argues that these Marian privileges are not extrinsic addenda but developments guided by the **rule of faith** and canonical coherence.

This Marian hermeneutic continues the general Hahn paradigm. The **liturgy** venerates Mary not as a competing mediator but as **Mother of the Church**, the maternal face of covenant kinship. Invocations of **Irenaeus** and **Athanasius** underline the Christological telos of Marian doctrine, and **Augustine’s** emphasis that Mary conceived in faith before conceiving in the flesh enables a spiritual reading that resists mere apologetic polemic. The effect is to embed Marian dogma within **covenant**, **temple**, and **kingdom** imagery that allegedly arises from the canonical text.

#### 6. Scripture, canon, and the rule of faith
Hahn’s hermeneutical manifesto appears in **Letter and Spirit** 2005 and **Consuming the Word** 2013. He advances the claim that the **canon** is a product of **liturgy**, that the **New Testament** originally names the **Eucharistic covenant**, and that Scripture and **Tradition** are distinct yet inseparable modes of the one divine **oikonomia**. He cites **Dei Verbum** and the practice of the early **Church** to argue that ecclesial liturgy is the cradle of the canonical process and thus the present matrix for biblical interpretation. His editorial leadership of the **Ignatius Catholic Study Bible** and the **Catholic Bible Dictionary** 2009 operationalizes this method with notes and essays that blend **patristic** citations, **doctrinal** loci, and historical context.

The apophatic partner to this constructive vision is his critique of **historical-critical** atomism in **Politicizing the Bible** 2012 with **Benjamin Wiker**. There he narrates the genealogy of modern criticism from **Hobbes** to **Spinoza** and beyond as a project that severs text from Church and reduces theology to politics. Hahn does not reject grammatical-historical inquiry but insists it be embedded in the **analogia fidei** and the **literal sense** as medievally understood. He holds that **typology** is not allegory floating free of the text but a reading rule grounded in the unity of **God’s economy** and the integrity of the **literal** narrative.

#### 7. Scholarly monograph and the academic horizon
The academic spine of Hahn’s work is **Kinship by Covenant** 2009, a Yale University Press monograph that surveys **ancient Near Eastern** covenant forms, **biblical law**, and **prophetic** covenant lawsuits to propose that covenant in Scripture always implies kinship. He analyzes the Abrahamic promises, the Sinai treaty, the Deuteronomic renewal, and the **Davidic** charter, then argues that the **New Covenant** universalizes family through Christ’s paschal mystery. The study engages **Moshe Weinfeld** on treaty types, **Gerhard von Rad** on tradition history, and **Brevard Childs** on canonical shaping, while carefully distinguishing oath-ceremony, sacrifice, and meal as gestures of familial incorporation.

This scholarly platform lifts his popular corpus above mere apologetics. In **Covenant and Communion** 2009 Hahn articulates **Joseph Ratzinger’s** biblical theology as a model of ecclesial exegesis, showing how **Christology**, **liturgy**, and **canon** form an inseparable triad. The footnotes in these works, combined with his ongoing **Letter and Spirit** journal and the **St. Paul Center** conferences, situate Hahn within a movement of Catholic biblical theology that includes colleagues like **Brant Pitre** and **Michael Barber**. The hallmark is a conviction that doctrine is the Church’s faithful reading of **Scripture** within worship, not a speculative overlay, and that **typology** genuinely discovers Christ as the telos of Israel.

#### 8. Moral and social accents within a covenantal frame
Beyond strictly dogmatic loci, Hahn’s writing returns to the moral and social implications of **covenant**. In **First Comes Love** 2002 and later in works on family and society such as **The First Society** 2018, he argues that the domestic church is the microcosm of the **kingdom of God**. The **Decalogue**, the Sermon on the Mount, and the **Beatitudes** are read as household law for a renewed Israel, with marriage as sacramental covenant and parenthood as participation in divine **fatherhood**. His 2022 volume **Holy Is His Name** offers a biblical theology of **holiness** as filial consecration, again relying on **temple** and **covenant** imagery to construe sanctification as participation in God’s own life.

The moral program flows from his sacramental realism. **Grace** is not external to nature but heals and elevates it, an **Augustinian** and **Thomist** line presented in accessible prose. Hahn’s catechetical attention to **confession** in **Lord, Have Mercy** 2003 embeds moral renewal in the covenant lawsuit and reconciliation paradigm. He often frames contemporary culture wars as contests over rival covenants, urging retrieval of **baptismal identity** and **Eucharistic** communion as the Church’s public witness. The rhetorical strategy aligns practice and dogma through the unifying concept of **oath-bound kinship**.

#### 9. An integrated Reformed and WTS evaluation
A Westminster and broader **Reformed** evaluation will recognize at least four points of real convergence in Hahn’s proposal. First, the stress on **covenant unity** and a **redemptive-historical** reading from **Adam** to **Christ** echoes **Vos** and **Ridderbos**, and the oath dimensions of **sacramentum** retrieve insights already present in **Calvin** on **signs and seals**. Second, the insistence that **typology** be tethered to the **literal sense** and governed by the **rule of faith** has analogues in the **analogia fidei** and in Reformed canonical exegesis. Third, the re-centering of the **Eucharist** in **Passover** and **Temple** categories aligns with biblical theology’s interest in **exodus**, **sacrifice**, and **new creation**. Fourth, the defense of **canon** as the Church’s reception of apostolic Scripture, against **historicist** reductionism, coincides with a Reformed rejection of rationalist criticism.

Yet decisive tensions remain. Hahn’s ecclesial location requires a **magisterial** principle that for Reformed theology compromises **sola Scriptura** as the supreme norm, since the Roman **magisterium** finally adjudicates the **rule of faith** governing **typology**. His account of **sacramental causality** crosses from **sign-and-seal** to **ex opere operato** efficacy, which Reformed churches reject as obscuring **union with Christ** received by **faith alone** and as introducing an ontology of grace that risks conflating sign and thing signified. The oath-centered **sacramentum** is conceptually rich, but a Westminster reading would re-situate oath and seal under the **covenant of grace** administered through Word and sacrament, while insisting that efficacy is tied instrumentally to the **Spirit’s** sovereign use of means and to **faith** as the only receiving instrument of **justification**. Hahn’s **Marian** and **Petrine** constructions, grounded in **typology** of **Gebirah** and **Isaiah 22**, will be judged exegetically underdetermined and theologically extrinsic to the **gospel** core, competing with **Christ’s** unique mediatorship and the sufficiency of the apostolic **presbyterate** without papal supremacy. Finally, where Hahn narrates **nature and grace** in Augustinian harmony, a WTS critique will urge a more dialectical stance shaped by **covenant of works** and **covenant of grace**, a sharper law and gospel distinction, and a stricter control of **sensus plenior** by authorial intent. The Reformed alternative affirms much of Hahn’s **covenant** and **kingdom** grammar while redirecting it toward **Christ alone**, **Scripture alone**, and **faith alone** within a **church** ordered by presbyterial parity rather than a **Davidic** monarchy.
