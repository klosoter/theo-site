### ESSAY
Katherine Sonderegger stands as a distinctive voice in contemporary **Anglican systematic theology**, notable for a disciplined return to **monotheism** and a patient, canonical reading of **Holy Scripture** as the mode of dogmatic reasoning. Formed in the aftermath of the twentieth-century **trinitarian revival**, the mid-century dominance of **Karl Barth**, and the late-century retrieval of **Aquinas**, she pursues a method she calls **positive theology under Scripture**, resisting elaborate prolegomena in favor of beginning where the Bible itself begins: with the **One Lord**, maker of heaven and earth. Her theological setting includes the Yale-inflected turn to **theological exegesis**, debates over **Rahner’s Rule** that the economic Trinity is the immanent Trinity, and the ascendance of **social trinitarianism** as a political and ecclesial model. Against these tides, Sonderegger contends that the church must first adore and confess the **simple, invisible, omnipresent, and omnipotent God** known in Israel’s Scriptures before pressing into trinitarian distinctions. The burden of her project is to display the **divine perfections** as biblical realities while renewing confidence in the **doctrine of God** as the central task of dogmatics.

Her early work, **That Jesus Christ Was Born a Jew: Karl Barth’s Doctrine of Israel** in 1992, placed her within the Barth renaissance while exposing tensions in Barth’s account of **Israel** and the **church**. She argued that Barth’s **election** doctrine secures Israel’s unrevoked calling yet risks rendering Israel’s historical life a mere cipher for **Christological** determinations. This study already displayed Sonderegger’s twin commitments: fidelity to **Scripture’s literal sense** read canonically, and a refusal to let dogmatic abstraction sever God’s ways *ad extra* from the concrete history of the **people of God**. The Barth book foreshadows her later insistence that the **One God of Israel** is not eclipsed by Christian **trinitarian confession** but remains the same Lord who elects, judges, forgives, and dwells with Israel in **shekinah** glory.

#### 1.
The methodological wager of **Systematic Theology, Volume 1: The Doctrine of God** in 2015 is arresting: Sonderegger begins not with **Trinity**, nor with **revelation**, nor with **hermeneutics**, but with **divine oneness** as the master perfection. This ordering is not a retreat to rational theism. Rather, she contends that the **unity of God** is the primary datum of biblical revelation, and that the metaphysical grammar of **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** are scripturally warranted ways of naming the One. Her strategy is to interweave thick exegesis of texts like **Deuteronomy 6**, **Exodus 3**, and **1 Kings 8** with doctrinal loci drawn from **Augustine** and **Aquinas**, thereby exhibiting a **scriptural metaphysics**. The result is a dogmatics whose idiom is doxological and exegetical, yet whose metaphysical stakes are classical: God is **actus purus**, the living One who is not in potency, who indwells creation by **omnipresence** without composition or division, and whose **invisibility** is the proper corollary of **transcendence** and **freedom**.

Within this volume, Sonderegger re-reads the **divine attributes** not as predicates appended to a concept of God, but as scriptural names of the biblical **Lord**. **Invisibility** is not the negation of creaturely visibility but the glory of the God who comes in the **cloud** and **thick darkness**. **Omnipresence** is grounded in the temple theology of **1 Kings**, the paradox that the Most High truly dwells among Israel yet cannot be contained by heaven’s heaven. **Simplicity** appears not as an imported philosophical axiom but as the liturgical and prophetic insistence that Israel must serve the **one Lord** without rival or internal fragmentation. **Aseity** and **immutability** safeguard **creatio ex nihilo** and divine **freedom**, so that the world’s being is sheer gift and not an emanation from a graded chain of being. Here Sonderegger retrieves **classical theism** as biblical theism, pressing readers to hear the cadence of **monotheism** as the very music of Scripture.

At several junctures she resists trends in twentieth-century dogmatics. She cautions against **Rahner’s Rule** when it is treated as an identity thesis that collapses the distinction between **immanent** and **economic** Trinity, warning that the **One God** risks dissolving into the economy of salvation. She offers a sustained critique of **social trinitarianism**, especially as it is conscripted to authorize democratic or egalitarian politics, echoing her influential claim that the **doctrine of the Trinity is not our social program**. Figures like **Moltmann** and **Jenson** draw particular scrutiny for reading temporality and history into God’s eternal life and for making **perichoresis** a model of human community. In place of these tendencies, Sonderegger advances **divine simplicity** and **unity** as the grammar that both grounds and limits theological speech about God, leaving room for the mystery of **incomprehensibility** and the authority of revealed names.

#### 2.
**Systematic Theology, Volume 2: The Doctrine of the Holy Trinity: Processions and Persons** in 2020 deliberately follows the first volume’s monotheistic ground. The doctrine of the **Trinity** is expounded as the unfathomable life of the **One God**, not a supplement or correction to **oneness** but its inner plenitude. Sonderegger retrieves the classical distinction between **processions** and **missions**. The eternal *processiones* are **eternal generation** of the Son and **spiration** of the Spirit, while the temporal *missiones* are the sending of the Son in the **incarnation** and the Spirit in **Pentecost**. She insists that **processio** must be established from **Scripture**, not merely by metaphysical deduction, appealing to biblical testimonies such as **John 5**, **John 14-16**, and **Romans 8** for the Son’s fromness and the Spirit’s fromness in the life of God. The Father as **Fons divinitatis**, the Son as **Only-begotten**, and the Spirit as **the Lord and Giver of Life** are articulated in a scriptural idiom that nonetheless resonates with **Athanasius**, **Basil**, and **Augustine**.

Crucially, Sonderegger resists a common modern sequence that reads the economy as the exhaustive key to the **immanent life**. She upholds a chastened yet real **analogy** between God’s eternal life and the economy, but she refuses to export historical suffering or temporal becoming into **God’s simplicity**. The result is a doctrinal portrait where **eternal generation** grounds the Son’s mission without dividing the **divine essence**, and where **spiration** names the Spirit’s origin without subordinationism or modalism. While sympathetic to **Barth** in privileging divine **freedom and grace**, she dissents from Barth’s reluctance to speak with classical assurance about **processions**. In this way, Sonderegger negotiates between modern **Christocentrism** and patristic **De Deo Trino**, arguing that the glory of **Trinity** rests on and perfects the confession of **One God**.

Across both volumes, Sonderegger’s leitmotif is **God’s holiness**. Holiness saturates her reading of **invisibility**, **omnipresence**, and **unity**, linking the Sinai **theophanies** to the temple and to the transfiguration of Christ. She treats **holiness** as the beauty of **simplicity** and the terror of divine **freedom**: God is not an item in the world but the One who is near in judgment and mercy. This emphasis yields an account of **idolatry** as metaphysical and moral confusion, a rupturing of **simplicity** through rival loves and images. It also leads her to the pastoral claim that dogmatics is an act of **worship**. The theologian speaks of the **ase** God only by the gift of the **Holy Spirit**, who conforms the church’s confession to the biblical names of **YHWH** and **Father, Son, and Holy Spirit**.

Sonderegger’s Anglican setting matters for her ecclesial posture. She draws from **Augustine’s** Western grammar of **person** and **essence**, while maintaining a liturgical imagination shaped by **Scripture**, **creed**, and **prayer**. Her engagement with **Israel** keeps Christian dogmatics honest about its roots in **Jewish monotheism**. Rehearsing **Paul’s** doxology in **Romans 11** and the irrevocability of the gifts, she resists a flattened **supersessionism** while still confessing **Christ** as the fulfillment of the promises. This dual fidelity intensifies her concern that the **One God** not be rendered a mere prelude to Trinity, but be confessed as the one Lord whom Israel worships and whom the church names as **Father of our Lord Jesus Christ**. Her early reading of **Barth on Israel** thus becomes a long thread stitching together monotheism, election, and trinitarian confession.

Her most visible polemical edge concerns **social trinitarianism** and **political theology**. Sonderegger contends that the triune **perichoresis** is not the template for human society, that **Trinity** does not authorize ecclesial democracy or egalitarian structures by metaphoric transfer. She calls this a category mistake that fails to honor **God’s transcendence** and **incomprehensibility**. The triune life is singular and non-analogous in this respect; the better theological route is to articulate political and ecclesial judgments from **Christology**, **ecclesiology**, and **natural law** where appropriate, not from speculative readings of **intra-divine relations**. In making this argument, she challenges **Moltmann’s** and **Jenson’s** eschatological socialities while finding firmer footing in **Augustine’s De Trinitate** and **Aquinas’s Summa Theologiae** on **processions** and **missions**. Theological speech about God must not be conscripted for purposes alien to **worship** and **adoration**.

Her prose moves with the cadence of **lectio divina**, an exegetical dogmatics that makes canonical **Scripture** the primary source and regulator of doctrine. Yet she is not biblicist; the idiom of **simplicity**, **aseity**, and **immutability** is avowedly metaphysical. The claim is that **biblical theism** licenses and demands a metaphysical grammar. The **burning bush**, the **pillar of fire**, and the **cloud** generate a theological ontology where God’s **invisibility** and **presence** coinhere, where the *ad extra* missions manifest but do not constitute the *ad intra* life. This posture allows Sonderegger to contest both a purely apophatic **negative theology** and a purely kataphatic flattening of divine names, advocating what might be called a doxological **via eminentiae** where biblical names are elevated, not emptied. In this she can be read as a constructive ally of **classical theism** that is genuinely baptized in **Scripture**.

The intellectual horizon of Sonderegger’s project is thus triangulated by **Barth**, **Aquinas**, and **Augustine**, with early modern debates in view. Unlike some neo-scholastic retrievals, she does not lead with **analogia entis** as a system-building principle, though she accepts a carefully delimited **analogy** governed by revelation. Unlike some Barthians, she refuses to let economy swallow **immanent Trinity**. Unlike some Anglicans, she does not trade in moderate vagueness; her assertions about **eternal generation**, **spiration**, and **divine simplicity** are exacting. The wager is that a renewed confession of the **One God** can reorder dogmatics in a way that is more faithful to the **canon**, more historically ecumenical with **Nicaea**, **Constantinople**, and **Chalcedon**, and more resistant to contemporary instrumentalization of **Trinity** for social agendas.

Sonderegger’s volumes have already reshaped debates on **divine attributes**, **prolegomena**, and **trinitarian method**. By relocating **oneness** and **simplicity** as the vestibule to all doctrine, she challenges curricula and textbooks that begin with **revelation** or **Trinity**. By insisting on **processions** in **Volume 2**, she contributes to the revival of classical **eternal generation** and **filioque** debates, albeit in her own biblical diction. By foregrounding **invisibility** and **omnipresence**, she forces renewed reckoning with **idolatry**, **image**, and **sacrament**. And by keeping **Israel** in view, she reminds the church that the proper name of God, **I AM**, sounds first from a bush in the wilderness, not only from the prologue of **John**. Her system remains unfinished, but the arc is clear: a **scriptural metaphysics** of the **One Lord** whose inner life is triune glory and whose works are powerful, free, and gracious.

In Reformed and Westminster circles, Sonderegger’s project invites both welcome and testing. Her rigorous advocacy of **divine simplicity**, **aseity**, **immutability**, and **incomprehensibility** coheres with classical **Reformed orthodoxy**. Her wariness toward **social trinitarianism** and her tempering of **Rahner’s Rule** echo concerns long present in **covenant theology** that God’s **archetypal knowledge** and being are not exhausted by the history of redemption. Yet two pressure points remain. First, by beginning dogmatics with a capacious **metaphysics of the One** rather than with **covenant Lordship** and **revelation** as principium, her ordering may seem to risk abstracting **YHWH** from the **covenantal economy**, whereas the Reformed stress that the knowledge of God is by **covenant condescension**, structured by **law and gospel** and the **Trinitarian pactum salutis**. Second, her sustained positive predication of the attributes sometimes reads as if the **analogy of faith** might slide toward a mild **univocity**, while Reformed doctors prefer a more explicit commitment to **archetypal-ectypal** distinction and the **doctrine of accommodation** to regulate language. A constructive Reformed alternative would affirm her classical attributes and her critique of social trinitarianism, while relocating her monotheistic prolegomenon within the **covenantal frame** of **Lordship**, tightening the **Creator-creature distinction** by explicit **archetypal-ectypal** grammar, and integrating **Trinity** with **redemptive history** so that the **One God** is confessed first and last as the **covenant God** of **Abraham**, revealed climactically in **Christ** and poured out by the **Spirit**.
