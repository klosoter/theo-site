### ESSAY
Hans W. Frei, born in 1922 in Berlin to Jewish parents and baptized into German Protestant life, came of age as the upheavals of the twentieth century recast both political and theological horizons. Emigrating to the United States in 1935, he entered the intellectual crucible of **Yale Divinity School**, where he studied under **H. Richard Niebuhr** and pursued a theological vocation that would be primarily hermeneutical rather than metaphysical. The European crisis of confidence in **historical criticism**, the legacy of **modern liberal theology**, and the postwar retrieval of **Karl Barth** formed the air he breathed. Frei’s career at Yale, beginning in the late 1950s and continuing until his death in 1988, fostered the emergence of what would be called the **postliberal** or Yale School, associated with figures like **George Lindbeck** and **David Kelsey**, yet distinctive in Frei’s own commitment to **realistic narrative** and the **literal sense** of Scripture as the matrix of Christian dogmatics.

Frei’s method is best described as an ecclesially located hermeneutic of **realistic narrative**, an attempt to retrieve the **sensus literalis** as the plain, world-depicting sense of biblical stories without either dissolving them into universal **religious experience** or submitting them to external **historical-scientific** verification as the ground of their meaning. Influenced by **Erich Auerbach’s** essay on **figura** and by the literary theory that attended to how narratives portray characters and worlds, Frei argued that the Gospels offer a coherent depiction of Jesus whose **identity** is rendered by the story itself. Against the **correlational** approach of **Friedrich Schleiermacher** and **Paul Tillich**, and against the **historicist referentialism** of **Ernst Troeltsch** and **Wolfhart Pannenberg**, Frei pursued an **intratextual interpretation** in which the biblical text supplies the conceptual and ontological grammar for Christian confession. He resisted **Rudolf Bultmann’s demythologization**, not by reasserting a rival metaphysics, but by contending that the **Gospel narratives** are the primary arena in which the risen Christ is known, as the story’s world interprets the reader rather than the reader’s world mastering the story.

The pivotal historical study, **The Eclipse of Biblical Narrative** published in 1974, narrates how eighteenth and nineteenth-century hermeneutics gradually displaced a precritical, churchly **figural reading** with competing schemes of either experiential expressivism or historical reconstruction. The tale moves through **Gotthold Lessing’s ditch**, **Baruch Spinoza’s** critique of prophecy, **Johann Salomo Semler’s** canon-historical distinctions, and **D. F. Strauss’s** mythic explanation, to show that both liberal and conservative strategies often lost grip on the **literal sense** as the canonical depiction of reality. Precritical exegesis, as Frei reads it with help from **Auerbach**, did not oppose history but configured it in terms of **figura**, in which earlier events find their fulfillment in later realities, above all the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The **eclipse** names the loss of confidence that the canonical narrative itself mediates the **identity of Jesus** and shapes the church’s understanding of the world.

In **The Identity of Jesus Christ** from 1975, Frei turned from historical narrative to constructive hermeneutics and a modest dogmatics. The controlling claim is that the identity of Jesus is given by the **Gospel narratives** as a **realistic narrative** portrayal of a character whose unity is the product of the story’s shape rather than an external metaphysical predicate. Frei distinguishes an **ascriptive Christology**, wherein titles like Son of God or Lord arise from the narrative depiction, from strategies that ground those titles in prior **religious experience** or in an independent **historical referent** secured by critical method. The **passion and resurrection** form the narrative’s focal center, so that the risen one is the crucified one, and this identity is rendered through the evangelists’ literary construction. The Old Testament is read **figurally**, not as a code of predictions but as a complex pattern of earlier and later relations in which Israel’s history is fulfilled in Christ. Here Frei’s use of **sensus literalis** means the plain reading of narrative as narrative, not a thin literalism, and his **realistic narrative** means a story that claims to depict the real, not a fiction that merely edifies.

The posthumously published **Types of Christian Theology** in 1992 offered a taxonomic map of theological options, built around the relation of Christian self-description to external forms of knowledge and culture. Frei lays out a spectrum that ranges from strong **correlation** and revisionary adaptation, through mediating positions that negotiate between churchly grammar and cultural reason, to robust **intratextual** and dogmatic stances where Scripture’s world determines what counts as reason. He advocated a **generous orthodoxy** that learns to live with certain tensions among types while maintaining that the canonical **narrative** remains the controlling norm for Christian identity. The selected essays in **Theology and Narrative** in 1993 deepen this program by exploring the classical **literal sense** and the way **doctrine** functions as second-order commentary on the narrative portrayal of God and Christ. Frei’s conceptual apparatus here is neither a linguistic idealism nor a fideistic refusal of reason, but a re-centering of **Scripture and church** as the primary site in which **theological judgment** is formed and tested.

Frei’s interlocutions were wide and careful. With **Karl Barth** he shared a suspicion of **natural theology** and a passion for the **Christological center**, yet he worried that Barth’s strong account of divine **self-revelation** risks eclipsing the textual dynamics by positing a dogmatic framework excessive to the narratives’ own grammar. With **George Lindbeck**, who would articulate a **cultural-linguistic** model in 1984, Frei aligned in rehabilitating ecclesial language as regulative and communal, though he resisted reducing the **Gospel** to a language game without ontological bite. Against **E. D. Hirsch’s** authorial-intention theory he insisted that the **sensus literalis** is the canonical text’s publicly available depiction rather than a reconstruction of an author’s psychology. He acknowledged the hermeneutical insights of **Hans-Georg Gadamer** and **Paul Ricoeur** on tradition and narrative identity, while staying close to **Auerbach’s** concrete sense that **figura** names a mode of reference internal to the diachronic fabric of Scripture. In debate with **Rudolf Bultmann** and **Wolfhart Pannenberg**, Frei argued that both demythologizing and scientific historiography, despite their deep differences, improperly make the text answer to extrinsic canons rather than letting the text tutor the canons.

The ecclesial and doctrinal implications of Frei’s hermeneutics are significant. The church is the people formed by the **canonical narrative**, and **doctrine** functions as rules that secure a faithful reading of the story rather than as freestanding metaphysical theses. The **Old Testament** and **New Testament** belong together through **figural reading**, in which Christ is the telos who, without obliterating the literal history of Israel, draws that history into a christological pattern. The **resurrection** thus is not a detachable event whose truth is adjudicated by neutral criteria, but the climax within the narrative by which Jesus is known as **Lord** and by which the church learns its own identity. Frei sought to avoid a naked confessionalism by emphasizing the public character of **realistic narrative** and the intelligibility of a world-claiming depiction, and to avoid reductionism by letting the **Scriptural canon** shape rather than mirror the world.

At the same time Frei showed a late-career enlargement of scope. The idiom of **generous orthodoxy** indicates his recognition that Christian theology must reckon with plural **types** and that conversation across them can be mutually instructive. He did not resolve the problem of **reference** in a neat theory. Instead he left signals that theological truth is a matter of the text’s **ontological claim** as rendered in the practices and judgments of the community shaped by it. Whether this amounts to a cautious **theological realism** or an eschewal of ontological commitments in favor of **intratextual coherence** remains contested among interpreters. What is clear is the enduring thesis that the **Gospel narratives** depict a real world in which Christ is Lord, and that theology’s task is to learn to read and live that story well.

Frei’s place in the broader landscape of **modern liberal theology** is both affiliative and critical. He shares with liberalism a suspicion of authoritarian metaphysical systems and a sensitivity to the historical situatedness of discourse. Yet he contests the liberal move to found theology on **universal religious consciousness** or **moral reason**, insisting instead on the **church’s Scripture** as the privileged site of God’s self-disclosure. In this respect he stands as a bridge figure, drawing from **Barth’s** witness to revelation while refusing to separate dogmatics from the **literary form** through which revelation is given. His watchword is not narrative for narrative’s sake, but **realistic narrative** as the form in which the **identity of Jesus Christ** is known and confessed.

Frei’s legacy has been influential across multiple streams. The Yale School’s **postliberal theology** carried forward his interest in **intratextual interpretation** and communal practices of reading, even as others like **Brevard Childs** developed a canonical approach with a stronger account of **divine authorship**, and ethicists like **Stanley Hauerwas** pressed the ecclesial implications of a community formed by the **Gospel**. The ongoing debates about **narrative theology**, **theological interpretation of Scripture**, and **theological realism** regularly return to Frei as a key architect. His work remains a touchstone for how to construe the relation between **Scripture**, **church**, and **dogma** in a late modern world that demands both intellectual honesty and ecclesial fidelity.

From a **Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Frei’s retrieval of **sensus literalis**, **figural reading**, and the **Christological unity of Scripture** is an important ally. Yet two tensions call for critique. First, his reluctance to articulate the **ontological realism** and **historical referentiality** of events like the **virgin birth** and the **bodily resurrection** risks detaching canonical depiction from God’s self-attesting acts in **covenantal history**, where **special revelation** and **redemptive history** are inseparably joined. Classical Reformed theology affirms that the **canon’s narratives** are true not only intratextually but also because the **triune God** authored and enacted them in space and time, a conviction underwritten by **the self-attestation of Scripture**, **the internal testimony of the Spirit**, and the **analogia fidei**. Second, Frei’s positioning of **doctrine** as largely second-order rules should be complemented by the Reformed insistence that dogma states **ontic truth** about God and his works, grounded in **divine authorship** and covenantal promise. A constructive alternative is a **covenantal realism** in which the **world-absorbing text** is authoritative precisely because the **Word of God** is living and active in the same history the text narrates, so that figural reading is tethered to God’s providential authorship and the church’s confession of Christ’s lordship over creation and redemption.
