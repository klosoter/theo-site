### ESSAY
#### 1. Context and formation
Katherine G. Schmidt emerges as a contemporary Catholic theologian whose work is situated at the crossroads of **postconciliar Catholic ressourcement** and the lived pressures of **digital modernity**. Her formation bears the mark of **Augustine’s theology of desire**, the **Thomistic account of virtue**, and a retrieval of **sacramental ontology** associated with **Henri de Lubac** and the **Communio** school. Yet, unlike many sacramental retrievals that focus primarily on metaphysical first principles, Schmidt trains her attention on the empirical textures of **networked life**, drawing on **Marshall McLuhan** and **Walter Ong** to frame the internet not merely as a tool but as a formative milieu, a habitus that shapes perception, desire, and community. This dual posture of historical theology and cultural analysis gives her thought a distinctive profile: the **Catholic imagination** is neither romanticized nor rejected, but subjected to rigorous analysis through the lenses of **media ecology**, **phenomenology**, and **virtue ethics**.

Her intellectual context is decisively marked by the theological aftershocks of **Vatican II**, with its affirmations of the **sacramentality of the world** and the universal call to **holiness**, as well as by conversations around **nature and grace** reopened by **de Lubac**. At the same time, she reads contemporary digital culture through the critical idioms of **Heidegger’s Gestell** and **Neil Postman’s technopoly**, noting the tendency of technological systems to absorb and reframe human agency. By juxtaposing **Augustine’s** account of **curiositas** and **studiositas** with contemporary practices of scrolling, streaming, and self-curation, Schmidt treats attention as a theological category and **desire** as a site of grace and distortion. The result is a conceptual topology where **incarnation**, **presence**, and **mediation** are interrogated under the conditions created by platforms and their logics.

#### 2. Method and epistemic stance
Schmidt’s method proceeds by **ressourcement** and **cultural diagnosis** in tandem. Theologically, she retrieves **Augustine** on **desire** and **image**, **Aquinas** on **virtue** and **habitus**, and the Communio tradition’s **sacramental ontology**. Culturally, she appropriates insights from **McLuhan** on how media are extensions that reshape the sensorium, and **Ong** on orality and literacy, integrating these with critical insights from **Sherry Turkle** on fragmented selves and **Heidegger** on instrumentality and enframing. Epistemically, she resists both naive technological instrumentalism and hard determinism, arguing that the internet neither simply serves preexisting ends nor entirely determines them. She advances a nuanced account of **mediation** where forms of communication participate analogically in the human capacity for communion. Theologically, she frames this within a **sacramental imagination**: because creation is ordered to grace in Christ, creaturely media can bear, refract, or resist patterns of **communio**, though they are not thereby elevated to **sacramental efficacy**.

A notable feature of Schmidt’s method is her retrieval of **attention** as a theological practice. Echoing **Simone Weil** and **Iris Murdoch** yet grounding her argument in **Augustinian** and **Thomistic** sources, she treats attention as a habit formed by liturgy and ascetic discipline. In this view, spiritual life involves the education of desire from **curiositas** to **studiositas**, from distraction to contemplative charity. The internet, in this analysis, can habituate vice through infinite scrolls and algorithmic personalization, yet it can also be disciplined towards **caritas** by practices of Sabbath, silence, and prudent curation. This virtue-ethical framing allows Schmidt to address questions of **presence** and **embodiment** without collapsing into a false choice between analog and digital, or between metaphysical dismissals and uncritical embrace.

#### 3. Major work: Virtual Communion (2020)
Schmidt’s signature contribution appears in **Virtual Communion (2020)**, where she offers a sustained account of **incarnation and presence** amid ubiquitous connectivity. The book’s central thesis is double: first, digital media are genuine forms of **mediation** that can foster **communion** by sustaining memory, conversation, and belonging; second, digital media cannot replicate the **sacramental presence** of Christ in the **Eucharist**, nor should they be construed as sacramental equivalents. Working with the classic distinction between **sacramentum** and **res**, and the complex mediating category of **res et sacramentum**, Schmidt clarifies that ecclesial life online can increase the bonds of charity and awareness of the **mystical body**, but it does not effect the **ex opere operato** grace attached to liturgical acts. Responding to the exigencies of the 2020 pandemic, she revisits the Catholic tradition of **spiritual communion** as articulated in **Tridentine** and later devotional sources, arguing that digitally mediated worship may occasion authentic desire for Christ even as it intensifies the felt lack of **embodied Eucharistic encounter**.

The book unfolds within a media-theoretical framework indebted to **McLuhan’s** axiom that the medium is the message. Schmidt shows how platforms foster a grammar of presence marked by immediacy, simultaneity, and surveillance, which can either support or undermine **ecclesial practices** such as confession, preaching, and common prayer. Drawing on **Charles Taylor’s** account of social imaginaries, she argues that the **Catholic imagination** should not deny the shaping force of platforms but should critically engage them, developing ascetical practices appropriate to the digital environment. She thus reframes debates about online church: not as a competition between technologies, but as a discernment about which mediations are congruent with the **incarnational logic** of the Gospel and which contort or eclipse it.

#### 4. Desire, attention, and formation
Across essays and public theology, Schmidt advances a distinctly **Augustinian** reading of digital habits. She recovers **curiositas** as a theological term for restless, scattershot seeking, contrasting it with **studiositas**, a disciplined attention ordered to truth and charity. Within digital environments, likes, notifications, and algorithmic novelty tempt the will toward the libido spectandi, the lust to look, which **Augustine** already foresaw in confessional reflections on the theater and spectacle. Schmidt integrates this with **Thomistic virtue theory**, proposing practices of attention that redistribute desire: liturgical participation, contemplative prayer, acts of service, and prudent limits on connectivity. Attention becomes an ascetic praxis, a schooling of the self in the **ordo amoris**, the order of loves.

This anthropology of desire also challenges prevalent reductions of online life to disembodiment. For Schmidt, the body is not bracketed by digital mediation; rather, bodies are implicated in attention, fatigue, and vulnerability. By appealing to **Joseph Ratzinger’s** reflections on **actuosa participatio** and **liturgy as form**, she argues that ecclesial formation must navigate the tension between accessibility and depth. Online pedagogy and catechesis can scaffold entry into the mysteries, but must yield to embodied sacramental participation where the **Word and body** coincide in the performative realism of the liturgy. Here, Schmidt’s **sacramental ontology** ensures that desire is not self-curated but received in the ecclesial economy of signs and grace.

#### 5. Mediation and presence
A recurring theme in Schmidt’s corpus is a theological grammar of **mediation**. Against both technophobia and technophilia, she treats mediation as a constitutive dimension of human communication that reflects the Creator’s gift of **analogy**. She does not deploy the contested **analogia entis** as a metaphysical thesis in explicit terms; still, her accounts of mediating forms operate analogically, arguing that finite communications can truly signify and participate in the gift of communion, without collapsing sign into thing. Drawing resources from **Aquinas** on signification and **Augustine** on the *signa resque*, she distinguishes kinds of presence: representational presence through images or text, interpersonal presence through dialogic exchange, and **sacramental presence** as the efficacious sign united to what it signifies.

This layered account enables careful judgments about online worship, confession, and pastoral care. Schmidt acknowledges that certain ministerial functions, like preaching or instruction, can be fittingly mediated by digital means, while others, such as **Eucharistic communion** and **sacramental reconciliation**, are intrinsically tied to bodily proximity and the material mediation established by Christ. She frames this not as a technological limitation but as a theological specification of Christ’s instituted signs. The upshot is a hopeful but sober assessment: digital media can support **koinonia** by extending conversation and care, but the center of ecclesial life remains the **sacramenta** where Christ acts as head in his body.

#### 6. Ecclesiology and the Catholic imagination
Schmidt’s ecclesiology is implicitly shaped by **de Lubac’s** insight that the **Eucharist makes the Church** and the **Church makes the Eucharist**, with care to avoid circularity by grounding both in Christ’s **totus Christus**. She applies this to digital life by arguing that online forms of gathering may express real bonds of charity and responsibility, yet they are properly ordered to the Eucharistic assembly. The **Catholic imagination**, in her rendering, recognizes creation as charged with the grandeur of God and therefore capable of bearing signs of grace, but it is also regulative: not every mediation is apt for every ecclesial act. In a media ecology defined by speed, display, and extraction, the Church offers temporal practices of slowed attentiveness, silence, and shared embodiment. Thus, her ecclesiology does not treat the internet as a sacrament, nor as anti-sacrament, but as a sphere of providence in which virtue must be cultivated and vice resisted.

To articulate this, Schmidt draws on **James K. A. Smith’s** account of **cultural liturgies** and **Taylor’s** social imaginaries, translating their insights into Catholic idioms attentive to **liturgy as theologia prima**. She welcomes the reminder that practices shape loves, while qualifying that the **gratuity of grace** and the **objectivity of the sacramenta** prevent liturgy from being collapsed into merely human habit. The internet’s liturgies of self-display and consumer choice invite ecclesial counter-formation rooted in **baptismal identity** and **Eucharistic thanksgiving**. Her argument is not only negative, however; she also sketches possibilities for digital witness, solidarity, and learning that anticipate the civic and ecclesial common good.

#### 7. Moral theology and public life online
Schmidt’s treatments of technology flow into **moral theology**, where she addresses speech, vulnerability, and the common good. Drawing on **Aquinas** on truth-telling and **Augustine** on charity, she urges practices of digital speech that resist calumny and performative outrage. She reads the internet’s economy through lenses similar to **Shoshana Zuboff’s** critique of **surveillance capitalism**, without collapsing theology into sociology. Theologically, the problem is not data collection per se, but the habituation of persons to instrumental rationality and the fragmentation of communal memory. Within this context, Schmidt commends **Catholic social teaching** commitments to solidarity, subsidiarity, and the preferential option for the poor as norms for platform design and policy.

Her constructive proposals are concrete. She advocates for Sabbath rhythms that interrupt compulsive connectivity, communal discernment about media use in parishes and families, and catechesis that addresses attention and desire as theological questions. She promotes digital examinations of conscience that assess both content and the mode of engagement: whether one’s online habits foster **studiositas**, truthfulness, and peace, or cultivate **curiositas**, envy, and wrath. In short, her moral theology translates classical virtues into contemporary practices shaped by the Church’s sacramental and communal life.

#### 8. Theological anthropology and Christology
While primarily a public theologian of digital life, Schmidt’s work presupposes a **theological anthropology** grounded in **imago Dei** as relational capacity for love, fulfilled in union with Christ. She resists reductive accounts of the self as either disembodied mind online or merely datafied subject. Instead, she proposes a Christologically inflected anthropology where desire is healed by participation in Christ’s **paschal mystery**. In this light, digital asceticism is not technophobic withdrawal but a practice of conformation to Christ, who calls disciples to watchfulness, prayer, and embodied love. Schmidt’s **Christology** animates her insistence that ecclesial life be centered on the **incarnate, crucified, and risen Lord** communicated through **Word and sacrament** rather than algorithmic spectacles.

In correlating anthropology and Christology, Schmidt also addresses youth faith formation and catechesis. She urges educators to combine the affordances of digital learning with in-person mentoring and liturgical participation. Here the **Catholic imagination** functions pedagogically: students are taught to read the world sacramentally, discerning how created goods point beyond themselves while avoiding idolatry. Her emphasis on **virtue**, **habitus**, and **ascetical practice** provides a stable bridge between doctrinal confession and daily discipleship in a networked world.

#### 9. Reception and Reformed/WTS evaluation
Reception of Schmidt’s work has been positive across Catholic pastoral and academic settings, especially for its timely articulation in **Virtual Communion (2020)** of how **spiritual communion** and **ecclesial bonds** may be maintained without confusing digitally mediated gatherings with **Eucharistic sacramentality**. Ecumenically, her resonance with **Augustinian desire**, **virtue ethics**, and **media realism** facilitates dialogue with Protestants concerned about embodiment and formation. She explicitly differentiates forms of presence, honors the limits of technology, and calls for **ascetic attention**, all of which commend themselves to a broad Christian audience wrestling with digital life.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation would welcome Schmidt’s Augustinian depth, her critique of **technological determinism**, and her refusal to sacralize the internet. Her insistence that the **Eucharist** cannot be virtually replicated parallels a Reformed stress on the instituted **means of grace**. Yet tensions arise around the broader **sacramental ontology** and **Catholic imagination** that frame her account of mediation. From a classical Reformed perspective anchored in the **Creator-creature distinction**, **sola Scriptura**, and a **covenantal economy of Word and sacrament**, one worries that sacramentalizing the created order risks flattening the antithesis between holy and common uses, blurring the unique efficacy of the Spirit working by and with the **Word**. An alternative Reformed articulation would ground mediation not in an expansive sacramental ontology but in the covenantal pattern of **special revelation**, where the **Word-Spirit** nexus regulates all ecclesial practices under Christ’s kingship. On this view, digital media may be providential tools within the sphere of common grace, subject to prudential wisdom and the **regulative principle of worship**; however, they remain extrinsic to the instituted means of grace and must be critically bounded by **Lord’s Day worship**, **preaching**, and the **sacraments**. Schmidt’s virtue-ethical disciplines of attention commend themselves to Reformed pastors, yet her analogical optimism about cultural mediations should be tempered by a Van Tilian sense of **antithesis** and a redemptive-historical focus on the church as pilgrim people, where formation is decisively tethered to covenantal ordinances rather than to a generalized sacramental view of culture.
