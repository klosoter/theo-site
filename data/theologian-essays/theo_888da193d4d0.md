### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Rudolf Bultmann, born in 1884 in Wiefelstede and deceased in 1976 in Marburg, came of age amid the unstable transition from nineteenth-century **liberal theology** to the crisis of modernity that followed World War I. Early studies in Tübingen, Berlin, and Marburg placed him under **Wilhelm Herrmann** and within the orbit of **Adolf von Harnack** and the **History-of-Religions school**, which furnished a comparative model for understanding the New Testament within a broader Greco-Roman and Jewish milieu. From 1921 to retirement he taught at Marburg, where his commitment to **historical criticism** took institutional form through the development of **Formgeschichte**, the classification of Gospel pericopes according to form and **Sitz im Leben**. The historical conclusion that the evangelists transmit the faith of early communities more than the biography of Jesus catalyzed his signature distinction between the **historical Jesus** and the **Christ of the kerygma**, a distinction that would drive his later **demythologizing** project.

The decisive philosophical catalyst arrived with **Martin Heidegger's Sein und Zeit** in 1927, during Heidegger's tenure in Marburg. Bultmann appropriated Heidegger's analysis of **Dasein** to articulate an **existential interpretation** of the New Testament, insisting that revelation addresses the human as being-toward-death enmeshed in **guilt**, **anxiety**, and **inauthenticity**. This move reframed hermeneutics: understanding is never presuppositionless but involves **Vorverständnis** and a **hermeneutical circle** in which the subject is addressed by the text. Consequently, Bultmann advanced **Sachkritik**, material criticism within the canon that judges tradition on the basis of the **gospel's** core claim rather than on putative apostolic authority tout court. The New Testament's truth becomes an event in **Verkündigung**, the preaching that discloses authentic **self-understanding**.

Bultmann's methodological manifesto reached its clearest expression in the 1941 essay **Neues Testament und Mythologie**, later republished in the debate volumes **Kerygma und Mythos**. He argued that the New Testament clothes its message in **myth**, a three-storied cosmology and miraculous causality that modern persons shaped by **science** cannot literally affirm. Demythologizing, however, is not reduction but **interpretation**: the task is to translate mythic language about **angels**, **demons**, **miracles**, and **resurrection** into existential assertions about human existence confronted by God's call. The **kerygma** does not offer information about supernatural mechanisms but summons decision before God. Hence Bultmann rejected a positivist **Heilsgeschichte** that would objectify divine acts as items in a causal sequence while still affirming with rigor the **historical-critical** investigation of the texts through **Formgeschichte** and source analysis.

#### 2. Early works and the historical Jesus
Bultmann's first major work, **Die Geschichte der synoptischen Tradition** in 1921, secured his reputation as the leading form critic. By cataloging miracle stories, pronouncement stories, parables, and legends, and assigning them to their **Sitz im Leben** in early Christian communities, he argued that the Synoptic material underwent creative transmission, shaped by catechetical, liturgical, and apologetic functions. The result was a methodological skepticism toward reconstructing the **life of Jesus** in the mode of nineteenth-century **Leben-Jesu Forschung**. Along with **Albert Schweitzer** and **William Wrede**, Bultmann insisted that theology should cease trying to retrieve Jesus' inner personality and instead attend to the **kerygma** that confronted the church. Such skepticism would later be labeled the **No Quest** for the historical Jesus, a stance that framed the stage for his student **Ernst Käsemann's** 1953 call for a **New Quest** to secure continuity between Jesus and the church.

In his popular-level book **Jesus** in 1926, translated as **Jesus and the Word** in 1934, Bultmann nevertheless outlined what could be responsibly said historically. Jesus proclaimed the **kingdom of God** as imminent and demanded **decision** in radical obedience, a message continuous with Jewish **eschatology** yet transposed in the early church into **Christological** proclamation. Bultmann affirmed core facts, including the **crucifixion** under **Pontius Pilate**, but denied that the Gospels permit a detailed portrait of Jesus' psychology or the historicity of many miracle narratives. Historically, Jesus brought a message; theologically, the **kerygma** preaches Christ. The tension between history and proclamation would fuel subsequent debates with **Karl Barth** on revelation and with **Oscar Cullmann** on **salvation history** as a linear series of divine acts.

#### 3. Demythologizing, Paul, and John
The program of **demythologizing** centered on Paul's theology. In the multi-decade essays gathered as **Glauben und Verstehen** and systematized in **Theologie des Neuen Testaments** volumes in 1948 and 1953, Bultmann presented **justification by faith** as the proclamation of God's unconditional acceptance that liberates the human from self-justification and slavish attachment to the world. Paul's mythic contrasts of **flesh** and **spirit**, **Adam** and **Christ**, **principalities** and **powers**, are interpreted as analyses of existence: life turned upon itself versus life opened by the word. The **righteousness of God** is not a transferable substance but the event in which the **word of the cross** creates new self-understanding. The **Spirit** is not an objectifiable force but the efficacy of preaching in which the human is addressed and freed for **authentic existence**. Faith is not assent to propositions about past miracles but obedient hearing in the now, an **eschatological** existence inaugurated in the present.

The 1941 **Gospel of John** commentary exemplifies Bultmann's critical acumen and speculative source analysis. He posited a **signs source** and a **revelatory discourse source** behind the canonical Gospel, extensively transposing Semitic expressions into a Hellenistic idiom of **dualism**, **light and darkness**, and pre-existent **Logos**. The Johannine **pre-existence** of Christ is treated as mythic language that expresses the existential claim that our authentic being comes only from a word spoken to us from beyond our fallen world. While engaging the **History-of-Religions school**, Bultmann assessed potential **gnostic** parallels without capitulating to a Gnostic reading. Yet his disinterest in a historical chain of tradition from Jesus to the Fourth Gospel sharpened disputes with scholars committed to **apostolicity** as a historical anchor and with theologians who insisted on the uniqueness of biblical **revelation** in history.

#### 4. Resurrection, Christology, and eschatology
Nowhere was the controversy more intense than over **resurrection** and **Christology**. Bultmann denied that the **empty tomb** can be made a historical datum accessible to neutral observers, rejecting apologetics that would treat Easter as an object within **history-as-science**. For him, Easter names the **kerygmatic** event in which the crucified is encountered as the eschatological Lord in the word of preaching. The **appearances** to the disciples are not camera-ready phenomena but language-events in which the community's self-understanding is transformed. The **virgin birth**, **ascension**, and **miracles** similarly function mythically and are to be interpreted as symbolic expressions of the **offense of the cross** and the radicality of divine grace. Christ's **pre-existence** is not a metaphysical status charted on a heavenly map but the claim that in this word we meet the one who addresses us from God's side. Eschatology is not a timetable but the **now-time** of decision, the **presence of eternity** within history as the human is summoned to authentic existence under the **Word**.

This existential **eschatology** does not evacuate the future but resituates it as the horizon of expectancy in the present. Bultmann spoke of the **eschatological reservation** that guards against triumphalism, preserving a tension between the already and the not yet. But he rejected concrete apocalyptic speculation and the **salvation-historical** schemes favored by **Cullmann** and later **Pannenberg**, which construe revelation primarily as public events that can be argued historically. For Bultmann, such objectification falls under **Troeltsch's** principles of historical criticism and cannot deliver faith. Only the **word-event** grounded in **kerygma** can.

#### 5. Hermeneutics, history, and the Gifford Lectures
The hermeneutical dimension of Bultmann's work matured in conversation with his students **Gerhard Ebeling** and **Ernst Fuchs**, whose **new hermeneutic** radicalized language as **event** and deepened the analysis of **pre-understanding** and the **hermeneutical circle**. While they extended his emphasis on **language-event**, Bultmann himself kept theological control through **Sachkritik**, the material center of the gospel as the criterion. In this he anticipated and provoked **Hans-Georg Gadamer's** philosophical hermeneutics, though Gadamer criticized the theological control as extrinsic to philosophical understanding. The upshot is an approach in which exegesis, history, and proclamation interplay: exegetical method through **Formgeschichte**, historical modesty concerning recoverable facts, and theological confidence in the **kerygma**'s transformative power.

Bultmann's 1955 **Gifford Lectures**, published as **History and Eschatology** in 1957, clarified his stance toward modern **historicism** and **science**. He rejected **natural theology** and the aspiration to derive God from the observation of nature or history. Modern historical method, shaped by **Troeltsch's** principles of correlation, analogy, and criticism, cannot be suspended for the sake of a miracle claim without undermining its own procedure. Yet Bultmann maintained that this does not preclude theology; rather it forces a choice for **eschatological** understanding, where **eternity** is present as address within time. History as a sequence of events remains opaque; the **meaning of history** becomes accessible when the **word** brings decision. In these lectures Bultmann staged a sustained debate with **Barth**, refusing an extrinsic revelation that bypasses history, and with **Pannenberg**, refusing the claim that revelation is simply identical with a public historical event. The wager was that the **kerygma** alone preserves both modern integrity and gospel offense.

#### 6. Interlocutors, debates, and developments
The demythologizing proposal provoked a vast debate. **Karl Barth** welcomed the break with **liberalism** but judged Bultmann's **existentialism** a new anthropocentrism that dissolves the **resurrection** and **incarnation** into self-understanding. **Emil Brunner** showed more sympathy yet still insisted on the objective pole of revelation. **Oscar Cullmann** advanced a **salvation-historical** view of time centered on the Christ-event as the midpoint of history, opposing Bultmann's reduction of history to existential address. **Wolfhart Pannenberg** and the Munich school demanded that **resurrection** be argued as a public event open to historical inquiry. Within Bultmann's own circle, **Ernst Käsemann** launched the **New Quest** to reestablish a measure of continuity between the **historical Jesus** and the **kerygma**, while **Ebeling** and **Fuchs** explored a linguistic turn. The published volumes **Kerygma und Mythos** collected responses from philosophers like **Karl Jaspers** and theologians across the spectrum, sharpening issues around **myth**, **truth**, and **history**.

The effect of these debates was not retreat but refinement. Bultmann never abandoned **demythologizing**, though he insisted repeatedly that it is not excision but **interpretation**. He affirmed the indispensability of **historical criticism** and equally the impossibility of grounding **faith** in historical argument. The dialectic between **history** and **kerygma** remained. Late essays revisited **Pauline theology**, clarified the function of **law and gospel**, and reaffirmed the Lutheran core that **justification by faith** is the hermeneutical key. In short, Bultmann reconfigured the exegete's task: analyze the text with critical tools of **Formgeschichte**, then preach its **kerygma** in a language that confronts modern existence without demanding a mythology incompatible with the **modern worldview**.

#### 7. Doctrinal profile in summary
Doctrinally, Bultmann's profile is defined by several integrated claims. First, **revelation as event** asserts that God comes to us in the **word** that addresses, not in objectifiable metaphysical facts, thus keeping theology free from **natural theology** and from the hubris of securing God within the net of **history-as-science**. Second, **demythologizing** reconstructs the symbolic grammar of the New Testament without demanding belief in a **three-decker universe**, rendering **angels**, **demons**, and **miracles** as existential judgments about bondage and liberation. Third, **existential eschatology** places the **judgment** and the **new creation** in the present encounter with the **kerygma**, while maintaining an **eschatological reservation** about final consummation. Fourth, the **justification by faith** at the heart of **Pauline theology** becomes the act in which self-justifying existence is dismantled by the **word of the cross**, a theological anthropology indebted to **Heidegger** yet normed by **Luther**. Fifth, **scripture** functions as the matrix of proclamation, but its truth is not identical with the literal historical claims of every passage; the **canon** is read through **Sachkritik** oriented by the gospel's center, a move that differentiates **dogmatic authority** from **historical origin**.

These claims cohered for Bultmann within a churchly vocation. He was not an outside critic but a preacher of the **kerygma** who taught generations of pastors to read critically and proclaim boldly. His insistence that the **Spirit** works through the **word-event** kept his exegetical method tethered to ecclesial practice. Even his most controversial theses on **resurrection** and **miracle** were proposed as aids to truthful preaching in a world shaped by **science** and **critical history**. The durability of his program owes much to this pastoral intention coupled with scholarly rigor.

#### 8. Legacy and evaluation from a Reformed/WTS standpoint
From a classical Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary vantage, Bultmann commands respect for his relentless focus on the **Word of God preached**, his sober deployment of **historical criticism**, and his earnest concern that **kerygma** confront modern men and women with radical **decision**. His emphasis on **justification by faith**, the **offense of the cross**, and the priority of **grace** over human striving resonates at points with Reformation convictions. Yet fundamental divergences remain. First, his Heideggerian **existentialism** functions as a governing **Vorverständnis** that relativizes the ontological claims of **incarnation**, **atonement**, and a bodily **resurrection**. In Reformed terms, this elevates autonomous **reason** and experience over **special revelation**, violating the principial submission of intellect to Scripture's **self-authenticating** authority by way of the **Spirit**. Second, the dismissal of **Heilsgeschichte** as objectifiable misconstrues the covenantal texture of revelation, where God binds himself by **promise** and acts in public, redemptive **history** culminating in the empty tomb as a real, witnessed event. Third, **Sachkritik** subjects the canon to an extra-canonical criterion that effectively usurps the **analogia fidei** and the unity of **Scripture** under Christ, undermining confidence in the text as inspired **Word**. Fourth, the demythologizing of **miracle** and **eschatology** collapses the Creator-creature distinction by refusing God's sovereign freedom to act within creation in ways not circumscribed by **Troeltschian** historical method. A constructive alternative is the redemptive-historical approach of **Geerhardus Vos** and **Herman Ridderbos**, who integrate inaugurated **eschatology** with public acts of God in covenant **history**, and the epistemic critique of **Cornelius Van Til**, who exposes the autonomy at work in historicist strictures. Thus while Bultmann can tutor Reformed preachers in the gravity of **kerygma**, the necessity of existential **summons**, and the discipline of **exegesis**, his program must be decisively corrected by affirming revelation as both act and word in history, the bodily **resurrection** as the ground of faith, and Scripture's **perspicuity** and **authority** as the principial norm of theology.
