### ESSAY
Chad Van Dixhoorn’s theological vocation is to reopen the door of the **Westminster Assembly** and let us listen until its deliberations resound as Scripture-saturated counsel for the church. His enduring contribution is to show that confessional **Reformed orthodoxy** is not a static monument but a living, argued-from-the-Bible grammar. Through the monumental edition of the **Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652** and accessible guides to the **Westminster Confession of Faith**, he has brought the seventeenth-century negotiations of **doctrine**, **worship**, and **polity** into constructive conversation with contemporary pastors. The lineaments of his approach are those of an ecclesially invested **historian-theologian** who reads the sources with philological care, doctrinal sympathy, and pastoral intent.

Formed in both ministerial and university settings, Van Dixhoorn stands at the intersection of **church history** and **systematic theology**. His doctoral research at **Cambridge** embedded him among early modernists who read the English Revolution as a crucible of ideas, while his ordination and pastoral work in the **Orthodox Presbyterian Church** trained him to hear doctrinal debate as counsel for souls. That dual formation matters: it grounds his work in archival **evidence** while tethering it to the confessional and liturgical needs of **Reformed churches**. In his classroom roles at **Westminster Theological Seminary** and later at **Reformed Theological Seminary**, he has modeled a pedagogy where **intellectual history** serves **dogmatics**, and **dogmatics** returns to history to test its claims. The result is neither antiquarian nostalgia nor a free-floating system, but a constructive retrieval of a historically determinate **Reformed catholicity**.

Methodologically, Van Dixhoorn is an advocate of **confessional hermeneutics** that honors the canonical pattern of **good and necessary consequence**. He reads the **Westminster Standards** by listening to the Assembly’s *ordo docendi* and *ordo deliberandi* as recorded in drafts, speeches, committees, and parliamentary interactions. The editorial labor of his **Minutes and Papers** displays classic tools of **textual criticism** and **archival philology**. Multiple manuscripts are collated, orthography is stabilized, and context is supplied so that a doctrinal sentence can be traced from proposal to adoption. The theological wager is that confessional sentences are best understood as solutions to exegetical problems and pastoral pressures. His maxim might be stated this way: if the confession is the tip of the spear, the minutes are the shaft, and both are needed for the church to thrust with clarity at contemporary errors in **Scripture**, **grace**, and **church order**.

The **Minutes and Papers of the Westminster Assembly, 1643–1652** is the cornerstone of Van Dixhoorn’s scholarly edifice. Spanning thousands of pages, the edition reconstructs the Assembly’s multi-year labor under the watchful eye of **Parliament**, the leadership of **William Twisse**, and the interventions of figures like **George Gillespie**, **Samuel Rutherford**, **Anthony Tuckney**, and the lay Erastian **John Selden**. The minutes trace debates over **WCF 1** on the sufficiency and clarity of **Scripture**, including the status of the **Apocrypha** and the principle of **good and necessary consequence**; over **WCF 2–3** on **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and the **eternal decree**; over **WCF 7–8** on **covenant of works**, **covenant of grace**, and the **pactum salutis**; and over **WCF 18–19** on **assurance**, **law and gospel**, and the **uses of the law**. Equally crucial are the Assembly’s debates producing the **Directory for Public Worship** and the **Form of Church Government**, where **jure divino Presbyterianism** contended with **Erastianism** and **Independency**. Van Dixhoorn shows how politics pressed, but did not author, the theological conclusions; the confessional text emerges as a biblically argued consensus among diverse **Reformed orthodox** voices.

If the Minutes give us the workshop, **Confessing the Faith** gives us a well-crafted set of tools. Published in 2014, it is an accessible yet learned commentary on the **Westminster Confession of Faith** designed for pastors, elders, and serious lay readers. The commentary refuses to reduce doctrine to proof-texts or biography; instead it explicates the Confession’s paragraphs in light of the **Assembly’s debates**, the **Bible**, and the pastoral horizon of **catechesis** and **discipleship**. Here the classic claim that the rule of faith is Scripture teaching by explicit statements and **good and necessary consequence** becomes a habit of reading, as Van Dixhoorn patiently shows how **WCF 1** coordinates inspiration, canon, and sufficiency for ecclesial confidence in the **Word of God**. His treatment of **WCF 18** clarifies that **assurance** is not the essence of **faith**, yet it is ordinarily attainable through the promises, sacraments, and the Spirit’s witness, a pastoral median that guards both tender consciences and the reality of **perseverance**. Throughout the volume, the grammar of the **covenants**, the **means of grace**, and the **moral law** provides a spine for sanctification that is neither antinomian nor legalistic.

Van Dixhoorn’s **God’s Ambassadors** complements this doctrinal commentary by offering a focused history of **preaching** and the pastoral office at the **Westminster Assembly**. The book’s thesis is straightforward: the divines sought to reform the English pulpit by retrieving a Pauline theology of ministry, especially the ambassadorial identity of the preacher in **2 Corinthians 5**. The **Directory for Public Worship** thus prescribes a ministry of the **Word** that is textual, doctrinal, applicatory, and doxological. The pulpit, not politics, becomes the Assembly’s chief instrument for national reformation. Van Dixhoorn details the divines’ expectations for sermon preparation, the primacy of **catechizing**, the fencing of the **Lord’s Supper**, and the habits of **pastoral visitation**. The point is theological: the church’s transformation proceeds through the ordinary **means of grace**, administered by called and examined ministers who carry the keys of the **kingdom** under Christ’s headship. By retrieving this vision, Van Dixhoorn supplies a counter-narrative to contemporary ministry pragmatisms and re-centers **worship** as the church’s engine of renewal.

At the core of Van Dixhoorn’s doctrinal retrieval lies **covenant theology** as articulated and refined in the Assembly’s debates. His editorial notes and essays show how the divines negotiated terminology like **foedus operum** and **foedus gratiae**, how they related the prelapsarian covenant to **law** as a principle of life, and how postlapsarian grace does not evacuate law but reframes it within union with Christ’s **active and passive obedience**. The minutes reveal different emphases on the **pactum salutis**, with some voices stressing the eternal counsel and others preferring to speak of the **mediatorial economy**, yet the confessional outcome secures a robust **Christology** grounded in the Son’s voluntary condescension under the covenantal terms of redemption. On the vexed question of **republication** at Sinai, Van Dixhoorn’s historical sensitivity is evident: the Assembly tolerated a spectrum of formulations that saw Mosaic law as republishing the **covenant of works** in a pedagogical sense while maintaining the unity of the **covenant of grace**. Here historical description restrains dogmatic overreach and invites readers to receive the Confession’s precise words as a carefully balanced testimony.

One of the most pastorally charged sites in the **Westminster Standards** is the question of **assurance** and the vitality of the **Christian life**. Van Dixhoorn’s scholarship clarifies the Assembly’s intention to distinguish **faith** from **assurance** without separating them. In **WCF 18**, assurance arises from three cords: the divine promises, the internal evidences of grace, and the inward witness of the **Spirit**. The minutes display the Assembly’s concerted effort to prevent both presumption and despair, drawing on a mature **Reformed scholastic** account of the *habitus* of faith and the *actus* of believing. This aligns with the broader **law-gospel** framework of **WCF 19**, where the **moral law** binds Christians unto obedience as a rule of life, while the **curse** has been removed in Christ. Van Dixhoorn’s insistence that the wording is pastorally precise guards against late-modern reductions of sanctification to therapeutic language and recovers a spiritual physics of sin and grace that is both biblical and ecclesial.

The contests over **church polity** and **worship** are a further arena where Van Dixhoorn’s editorial work proves decisive. The Assembly’s conflict with **Erastian** proposals centered on the **keys of the kingdom** and church censures. Through the minutes he shows how the **Presbyterian** divines defended the **jure divino** character of presbyterial government from Scripture rather than from mere expedience, arguing that Christ’s **headship** entails a church order competent to discipline. Simultaneously, debates with **Independents** sharpened the doctrine of the visible church, the place of synods, and the obligations of congregations to the broader body. On worship, the **regulative principle** emerges as the assembly’s hermeneutical axiom: only what God commands is permitted for the public assemblies. The **Directory for Public Worship** encodes this posture in instructions for prayer, reading, preaching, sacraments, fasting, and days of thanksgiving, while conspicuously avoiding a fixed liturgy. Van Dixhoorn traces how these choices balanced catholic continuity with **Reformation** conscience, and how they were justified by **good and necessary consequence** rather than ecclesiastical fiat.

The shape of Scripture’s authority is everywhere present in Van Dixhoorn’s work as the doctrinal through-line of **Reformed orthodoxy**. **WCF 1** stands as a hermeneutical charter: inspiration grounds infallibility, canon provides unity, the clarity of Scripture safeguards catholic comprehension, and the sufficiency of Scripture frames all claims by church or magistrate. By tracing how these claims were debated and codified, Van Dixhoorn shows that the Confession’s stance on **tradition**, **reason**, and **experience** is not a denial of their ministerial uses but a determination of their proper order *ad extra* of the Word. He also attends to the Confession’s logic of **providence**, **Christ’s mediatorial offices**, and **sacramental efficacy**, always returning to the minutes to display the exegetical scaffolding beneath the final formulary. The result is a portrait of the **Westminster Standards** as a catholic, Scripture-governed theology rather than a tribal confession.

Beyond the page, Van Dixhoorn has cultivated infrastructures of retrieval. The **Westminster Assembly Project**, a digital humanities effort, has disseminated transcriptions, bibliographies, and research tools to scholars and pastors across the globe, catalyzing a generation of studies in **post-Reformation Reformed orthodoxy**. As a teacher and preacher he models how to move from **archive** to **pulpit**, how to let **confessional sentences** shape counsel in marriage, catechesis, and church discipline. Even in works like **Gospel-Shaped Marriage**, his pastoral co-authored volume, the fingerprints of the **Westminster** grammar are evident: marriage is a creation ordinance ordered by **law**, healed and sanctified by **grace**, and sustained by the **means of grace** within the **church**. Here retrieval becomes pastoral practice, not merely historical reconstruction.

In sum, Van Dixhoorn proposes that doctrinal construction should be conducted with the **Westminster Standards** in one hand and the **Minutes and Papers** in the other. His signal achievement is to set the record straight on what the **Assembly** did and did not say, to recover the texture of confessional reasoning, and to commend a ministerial vision centered on **Word**, **sacrament**, and **discipline**. The effect is both clarifying and stabilizing for **Reformed churches** that desire catholic depth without confessional drift. To that end, his work has reset debates about **Calvin and the Calvinists**, better described now as intramural differences within a recognizable **Reformed orthodox** consensus, and has supplied contemporary theologians with primary sources rightly ordered for **dogmatic** use.

Reformed and WTS evaluation. From a **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, Van Dixhoorn’s strengths are formidable: a principled **Sola Scriptura** anchored in **WCF 1**, a careful retrieval of **covenant theology** that resists anachronism, a robust doctrine of **preaching** and the **means of grace**, and an ecclesiology that takes **Christ’s headship** and **discipline** seriously. Two cautions sharpen rather than blunt the appreciation. First, the hermeneutic that privileges minutes as the key to intent must not be mistaken for a canon within the canon; the norming norm remains **Scripture**, and constructive dogmatics must finally answer to canonical exegesis shaped by redemptive-historical insights associated with **Vos**, **Machen**, and **Van Til**. Second, the normativity of seventeenth-century **ecclesial practice** demands principled translation, lest historically specific **Erastian** pressures or parliamentary compromises be baptized as timeless. Where his work is received as a disciplined aid to reading the **Westminster Standards** rather than as their extrinsic rule, Van Dixhoorn equips the church to hold together revelation and confession, covenant and gospel, church and world, nature and grace, in a classical **Reformed** equilibrium.
