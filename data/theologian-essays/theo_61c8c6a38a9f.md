### ESSAY
Nick Couldry emerges from the late twentieth-century British trajectory that weds **cultural studies** to normative reflection on **media power**, forming a distinctive field-based, practice-oriented critique of the **public sphere** under **neoliberalism**. Educated within elite British institutions and long associated with the **London School of Economics**, he positioned himself at the intersection of **anthropology of ritual**, **sociology of knowledge**, and **critical theory**, diagnosing how media constitute social order. Methodologically, he integrates **Durkheim’s** attention to the sacred, **Bourdieu’s** theory of **field** and **symbolic power**, **Foucault’s** analytics of **governmentality**, and a guarded engagement with **Habermas’s** discourse ethics. The result is a constructivist practice theory: media do not simply reflect reality; they enact it by organizing practices in space and time. The central wager, crystallized in the notion of the **myth of the mediated center**, is that modern societies imagine social unity as gathered around a mediated center whose rituals and routines allocate significance, authority, and attention.

Couldry’s early work consolidated this method and thesis. In **Inside Culture: Reimagining the Method of Cultural Studies** (2000), he reoriented **cultural studies** away from mere textualism toward the analysis of **practice**, insisting that the study of media requires ethnographic attention to what people do in relation to media institutions. He argued that the power of media is not reducible to content; it is sedimented within everyday routines, institutional hierarchies, and boundary-maintaining acts. This redirected focus sets up **Media Rituals: A Critical Approach** (2003), where he advances a critique of the **myth of the mediated center** as a cultural formation that lends sacred aura to the media’s claim of representing society to itself. Here the convergence of **Durkheim** and **Bourdieu** becomes overt: media events are ritualized performances that claim centrality, and thus allocate legitimacy across the **field** of cultural production, shaping how other institutions locate themselves relative to media-defined centrality.

The conceptual centerpiece, the **myth of the mediated center**, names a social imaginary that treats media institutions as the privileged site of access to what supposedly matters most in the social order. In **Media Rituals** (2003), Couldry shows how newsroom routines, award ceremonies, election nights, and celebrity culture function as **rituals** that consecrate this myth. Drawing on **Durkheim’s** sacred-profane distinction, he suggests that media rituals mark the sacred center and cast alternative sites as peripheral. The myth is consequential: it legitimates media authority, concentrates attention, and naturalizes the marginalization of voices and practices that do not fit media logics. Through a **Bourdieuian** lens, these rituals reproduce **symbolic power**, embedding asymmetries in the distribution of recognition. The argument is not that media are all-powerful; rather, media are situated institutions whose ritual claims subtly coordinate a social map of centrality and periphery, with real ethical stakes for visibility, dignity, and democratic life.

This normative claim expands in **Why Voice Matters: Culture and Politics After Neoliberalism** (2010), where Couldry articulates **voice** as a moral and political category, not merely an expressive act. For him, voice is the ongoing practice of giving an account of oneself and one’s place within social relations that can be taken into account by others within institutional arrangements. The **neoliberal** configuration of power, he argues, hollows out this practice by substituting performance metrics, market feedback, and audit procedures for actual participation, thus deforming the **public sphere**. He integrates **Habermasian** concerns for communicative inclusion with a granular, practice-level analysis of how institutions enable or foreclose voice. The normative kernel is clear: a healthy society must cultivate infrastructures of **listening** that respect voice as a process of social reflexivity and justice. This vision stands as a counter-myth to the mediated center, shifting focus from representational centrality to distributed practices of acknowledgment.

In **Media, Society, World: Social Theory and Digital Media Practice** (2012), Couldry consolidates a **practice theory** of media under conditions of globalization and digitalization. He emphasizes the ways digital media reconfigure the conditions of practice, linking localized routines to translocal networks, and transforming what he calls the world’s mediated address. This phase of his work resists both technological determinism and nostalgic humanism, contending that the social is increasingly organized through media-related practices that redefine **worldness**. The vocabulary of **practice**, **field**, and **power** remains central, but with fresh attention to digital infrastructures, algorithms, and new forms of attention allocation. The question is not whether media mediate the social; it is how their increasingly ubiquitous presence changes the very grammar of social coordination, authority, and recognition within and beyond the **public sphere**.

A major synthesis appears in **The Mediated Construction of Reality** (2016), coauthored with **Andreas Hepp**, which revisits **Berger and Luckmann’s** social constructionism for the age of **deep mediatization**. Couldry and Hepp argue that reality is always constructed through communicative processes, and that the intensification of media technologies transforms the institutional scaffolding of that construction. They introduce concepts such as **communicative figurations**, the patterned constellations of actors, technologies, and practices that stabilize social worlds. The book extends **practice theory** by threading through the layered materiality of media infrastructures and the multiplicity of communicative orders, acknowledging that modern social life is subject to an increasingly dense mesh of mediations. There is no reduction to media determinism; instead, the claim is that contemporary forms of meaning-making and institutional reproduction cannot be understood apart from deep mediatization’s reshaping of the grounds for **voice**, ritual, and power.

Couldry’s most widely discussed intervention is the framework of **data colonialism**, elaborated with **Ulises A. Mejias** in the monograph **The Costs of Connection: How Data Is Colonizing Human Life and Appropriating It for Capitalism** (2019). Here they argue that the extraction of data from everyday life constitutes a new social order that merges the logics of **historic colonialism** and **capitalist appropriation**. Core categories include **data relations**, the new social relations built on the continuous capture and processing of human life, and **extractivism**, the large-scale appropriation of sociality by platforms and infrastructures that render life as data. Influenced by **Anibal Quijano’s** theory of coloniality and **Cedric Robinson’s** racial capitalism, they claim this order enacts an ongoing **enclosure** of the lifeworld, converting the practice of **voice** into inputs for calculative systems and foreclosing autonomous spaces of social reproduction. The argument is diagnostic and normative: data colonialism is not a metaphor but a structural continuation and reconfiguration of colonial power that demands organized resistance and alternative institutional designs for data governance.

The **data colonialism** program engages and differentiates itself from adjacent critiques. In relation to **Zuboff’s** account of **surveillance capitalism**, Couldry and Mejias insist that surveillance is a surface feature of a deeper transformation in the social relations of appropriation. Against **Habermasian** hopes that the **public sphere** can be reconstituted through rational-critical discourse alone, they highlight infrastructural power that disciplines participation before discourse occurs. Regarding **Foucault**, they extend governmentality to the algorithmic era, showing how the conduct of conduct is automated through data flows. They also draw on **Polanyi’s** notion of fictitious commodities to describe how data commodification disembeds persons from contexts of care. Critics have queried whether the colonial analogy risks inflation, but Couldry defends its specificity: as with older colonialism, the new order institutes asymmetries of extraction, classification, and control across global lines of power. Through initiatives like **Tierra Comun** launched in 2020, he links scholarship to activism, amplifying voices from the Global South and arguing for forms of **data justice** that resist enclosure.

Throughout, Couldry sustains a thematic concern for **voice** as both an ethical imperative and a sociological lens. In media ritual theory, the myth of the mediated center functions to organize voice hierarchically; in the critique of neoliberalism, **auditing** displaces listening; in deep mediatization, the very channels of voice are reconfigured; and in data colonialism, voice becomes raw material for extraction. He criticizes proceduralist models of the **public sphere** that neglect how institutional design and media infrastructures pre-structure access and audibility. The upshot is a call for institutional pluralism that rebuilds infrastructures for participation, situates **media power** within democratic accountability, and protects spaces where attention, recognition, and narrative can be exchanged without capture. His work provides conceptual tools for evaluating how contemporary institutions stage authority, how they ritualize belonging, and how they transform the conditions for collective self-understanding.

The theological purchase of Couldry’s project becomes visible once one reframes **media rituals** as a study of modern liturgies, **voice** as a moral capacity grounded in personhood, and **data colonialism** as a critique of new forms of domination over creaturely life. The analysis of the **myth of the mediated center** maps onto a phenomenology of idolatry: a contingent institution claims a quasi-sacred centrality and mediates access to significance. A theological anthropology attentive to the **imago Dei** can appropriate his category of **voice** to underscore created persons as agents whose speech and testimony are not mere data points but covenantal acts that seek acknowledgment and truth. His practice theory helps churches and theologians discern how liturgical, catechetical, and pastoral practices are conditioned by **deep mediatization**, and how ecclesial life might resist reduction to metrics and market attention. The **data colonialism** thesis sharpens Christian social critique by identifying the enclosure of life as a matter of domination that intersects with old patterns of **coloniality** and **racial capitalism**, calling the church to solidarity with those whose voice is algorithmically marginalized. In this way, Couldry equips theology to analyze powers and principalities as they are concretized in platforms, infrastructures, and the everyday rituals that sustain them.

Reformed/WTS evaluation: Reformed theology can receive Couldry’s insights into **media rituals**, **voice**, and **data colonialism** as diagnostic of the antithesis between **idolatry** and the worship of the **triune God**, while probing his constructivist epistemology and secular normativity. First, the **myth of the mediated center** exposes a rival liturgy that claims social centrality; Reformed accounts of **Christ’s headship** and **Scripture’s sufficiency** re-center mediation on Word and sacrament, reading media centrality as a disorder of **revelation** and **providence**. Second, Couldry’s moral account of **voice** aligns with the **imago Dei** and the dignity of human speech as covenantal witness, but his norm lacks a transcendent anchor; a Reformed **covenantal ontology** grounds voice in divine address and neighbor love, while acknowledging the **noetic effects of sin** that corrupt both speakers and institutions. Third, his **practice theory** rightly resists determinism, yet his strong social constructivism can flatten **creational givenness**; a Kuyperian **sphere sovereignty** reframes institutional pluralism as a creational norm that limits media and state enclosure. Finally, **data colonialism** powerfully names extractive domination, but its liberationist horizon risks immanent closure; Reformed eschatology sustains resistance through **common grace** and **special grace**, calling for principled limits on data extraction, institutional repentance, and alternative practices of attention shaped by the church’s **lex orandi** under Christ’s lordship. In sum, Couldry’s critique provides sharp tools for discerning cultural liturgies and powers, but Reformed theology recalibrates his insights within a theocentric account of revelation, creation’s orders, and grace.
