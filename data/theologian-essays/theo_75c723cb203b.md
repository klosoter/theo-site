### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
John Behr emerged as a leading **Eastern Orthodox** theologian shaped by the **neo-patristic synthesis** inaugurated by **Georges Florovsky** and pursued at **St Vladimir’s Orthodox Theological Seminary** in New York. Educated in the United Kingdom and ordained as an Orthodox priest, he served as Dean of **St Vladimir’s Seminary** from 2007 to 2017 and later became **Regius Professor of Humanity** at the University of Aberdeen in 2020. His career unfolds within a late modern renaissance of **patristics**, the reception of **biblical theology**, and a growing impatience with both confessional **scholasticism** and reductive **historicism**. Behr’s method makes a deliberate return to the Fathers as living theologians, yet he claims this is not a nostalgic repristination of **patristic authorities** but a renewal of their central insight that **theology is exegesis**. The liturgical pattern of **Pascha** provides the hermeneutical core, so that the crucified and risen Christ opens the Scriptures on the way to **Nicaea**, yielding a doctrinal grammar centered on **homoousios** and **Christ’s identity**. He insists that the knowledge of God is shaped by the **economy** disclosed in the **Cross and Resurrection**, under the **rule of faith** and within the ascetical habitus of **prayer** and **martyrdom**, an approach resonant with **apophatic theology** and the patristic conviction that genuine **theologia** is learned only through participation.

Behr defines his epistemic stance as **paschal exegesis**. That phrase signals his conviction that the end clarifies the beginning and that Scripture is read truthfully only from the vantage of the **Passion**, just as **Luke 24** portrays Christ opening Moses and the Prophets to the disciples through the necessity of **the suffering Messiah**. He frames this as a disciplined adherence to the **regula fidei**, a hermeneutical canon that guides the Church’s reading and prevents both atomistic **proof-texting** and abstract **metaphysical speculation** detached from the **economy**. The scriptural witness is thus cruciform in content and ecclesial in form, leading to a retrieval of **figural reading** that converses with **Brevard Childs** and **Hans Frei** while insisting that patristic figuration is not pre-modern naivete but the mature fruit of the Church’s **liturgical** and **ascetical** life. This method underwrites Behr’s historical practice: the **doctrinal development** from the apostolic age to **Nicaea** is not a Hellenizing drift but the theological distillation of **paschal confession** into a precise vocabulary of **Christ’s identity**.

#### 2. Early labors with Irenaeus and the anti-gnostic rule
Behr’s first major labors concentrated on **Irenaeus of Lyons**, whose anti-gnostic synthesis provided a programmatic template for Behr’s own theological vision. His edition and translation of **On the Apostolic Preaching** in 1997 for the **SVS Press Popular Patristics** series, together with ongoing work on **Against the Heresies**, made Irenaeus accessible to contemporary readers. Behr foregrounds **recapitulation**, the notion that the incarnate Son gathers up Adamic history and brings it to its telos, and he highlights Irenaeus’s celebrated dictum **gloria Dei vivens homo**. For Behr the line culminates in the reverse clause that the **life of the human is the vision of God**, which shows that human flourishing is inextricably bound to deifying contemplation. He situates this in an anti-gnostic frame: the **rule of faith** confesses one Creator and one economy culminating in the incarnate Crucified, thus refuting dualist mythologies and displacing merely speculative **cosmologies**.

This Irenaean core shapes how Behr reads continuity and change between **apostolic proclamation** and later **conciliar dogma**. He privileges **martyrdom** and **asceticism**, reading them as irreducible signs that theology matures in the cruciform life rather than in abstract polemics. The coherence of **Genesis** with **Golgotha** becomes decisive for anthropology, such that Adam is not the measure of **human nature** but the type and shadow recapitulated by Christ. In this light, Behr retrieves **Melito of Sardis** and his **Paschal Homily** as exemplary instances of early **paschal exegesis**, where Israel’s history is read as a single dramatic figuration of the Pascha of the Lord. From this patristic dossier Behr derives a methodological thesis for later debates about **Christology** and **Trinity**: doctrinal precision is the afterglow of **paschal reading**, not the result of importing alien **philosophy** into the Church.

#### 3. From the Cross to Nicaea: the grammar of Christ’s identity
The programmatic exposition of Behr’s historiography appears in **The Way to Nicaea** in 2001 and **The Nicene Faith** in 2004. These volumes argue that the movement from the New Testament to **Nicaea** should be read as the consolidation of a **hermeneutical confession** about Christ’s identity, rather than as a shift from narrative to metaphysics. The term **homoousios** is thereby construed as a rule for reading Scripture in the Church, safeguarding that the one who hung on the **Cross** is none other than the **one Lord** confessed alongside the **one God** of Israel. Here Behr enters conversation with modern patristic historiography, including **Rowan Williams** on Arius, **Lewis Ayres** on Nicaea and its legacy, and **Khaled Anatolios** on the dynamics of trinitarian reasoning. While grateful for their historical acuity, Behr presses a theological point: **Arianism** is not primarily a speculative mistake but a failure to maintain the paschal identification of Jesus with the God of Israel according to the **rule of faith**.

Within this arc, Behr accentuates the **economy and theology** distinction. Following **Athanasius**, he contends that we know the **Trinity** as the economy of salvation discloses the Son and Spirit in their saving work, and that this disclosure sets the grammar for speaking of divine **simplicity** and **inseparable operations**. The creedal confessions of **Nicaea** and **Constantinople** thus serve as hermeneutical markers rather than speculative ceilings. The cruciform logic is irreducible: the **identity of Christ** is known under the sign of the **Passion**, so that the pattern of **Philippians 2** shapes the Church’s speech about God. Far from a capitulation to **Hellenism**, the councils articulate the scriptural God as confessed in **baptism** and **Eucharist**, the living matrix of **dogma** according to Behr’s narrative.

#### 4. The Mystery of Christ and cruciform anthropology
Behr’s theological center of gravity is made pastorally explicit in **The Mystery of Christ: Life in Death** in 2006. Here the thesis of **paschal exegesis** becomes an existential program of **cruciform discipleship**. Baptism, Eucharist, martyrdom, and ascetic practice are construed as participations in the **Pascha** of Christ by the Spirit, enacting the **theosis** of the faithful as they are conformed to the Crucified. Behr refuses to isolate soteriology from anthropology. He argues that to become human is to be united to the crucified and risen Lord, such that **human nature** is eschatologically determined by the new Adam and not by a speculative prelapsarian ideal. The **image and likeness** distinction is used to thematize the dynamism of human growth into Christ, tethering **ethics**, **spirituality**, and **dogma** to the same paschal axis.

This anthropology is sharpened against both **gnostic** denigration of the body and modern **secular humanism** that detaches dignity from communion with God. By placing **life in death** at the heart of Christian identity, Behr retrieves early monastic wisdom that the true **theologian** is one who prays and that the ascetic, like the **martyr**, witnesses to divine life by dying daily. The controlling doctrinal tools remain the **rule of faith**, **recapitulation**, and the paschal rereading of **Scripture**. Behr’s language of **participation** and **deification** is practical rather than speculative, aimed less at metaphysical schemas and more at the liturgical formation through which the Church inhabits the mystery of Christ.

#### 5. Becoming Human and the eschatological beginning
In **Becoming Human** in 2013, along with **Irenaeus of Lyons** the same year, Behr extends his anthropology into a sustained argument about **eschatological protology**. He insists that the **beginning** is known only from the **end**, so that **Genesis** must be interpreted in the light of **Golgotha**. Adam is a type, not a finished norm, and the true **anthropos** is manifested only in Christ. Consequently, **image** is gift and **likeness** is destiny, realized by the Spirit through ecclesial life ordered to **Eucharist** and **ascetic** discipline. The notion of **becoming human** challenges any account of nature that would be fully intelligible apart from the **economy** of salvation, and it refracts **theosis** through the practices of **repentance** and **love** rather than speculative ascent.

Behr also grapples with modern interlocutors, engaging the edges of **secular humanism** and late modern anthropology while retrieving **Irenaeus** against both modern **Pelagianisms** and quietist **passivity**. The participatory shape of salvation is cruciform and ecclesial. The logic of **recapitulation** ensures that salvation encompasses body and history, rescuing creation from dualism and affirming the goodness of the **cosmos** under the lordship of the risen Christ. Behr’s distinctive mark is to wed such strong claims to a disciplined **apophatic** reserve, refusing to venture beyond what the **rule of faith** and **paschal exegesis** authorize.

#### 6. Origen and the rehabilitation of early Christian reasoning
The translation of **Origen’s On First Principles** in 2017 with a lengthy introduction displays Behr’s willingness to reappraise disputed patristic voices within the same **paschal** horizon. He urges a careful reading of **Origen** that rightly acknowledges speculative risks while recognizing his basic loyalty to the **rule of faith**. On debated themes such as **apokatastasis**, Behr argues that the central logic is pastoral and exegetical, ordered to the **purification** of the soul and the christological reading of **Scripture**, rather than an abstract commitment to universal restoration. In this rehabilitation he aligns methodologically with patristic historians like **Lewis Ayres** and theologians like **Khaled Anatolios**, who resist the caricature of early theology as naïve Platonism.

Behr’s move here is not antiquarian. By retrieving **Origen**, he underscores the early Church’s conviction that **theology** is disciplined contemplation of the **economy** as given in **Scripture**, where allegory is not escapism but the scriptural habit of reading events **figurally** under Christ. This insistence reinvigorates debates about **biblical exegesis**, canon, and the relationship between literal and spiritual senses, in conversation with **Brevard Childs** and **Hans Frei**. The payoff is twofold. First, **dogma** is stabilized as the Church’s wise summary of Scripture. Second, **spiritual exegesis** becomes a criterion of orthodoxy because the devout reader learns to confess the **one God and Father** and the **one Lord Jesus Christ** by tracing the form of the **Cross** throughout the canon.

#### 7. Johannine theology and the prologue to theology
Behr’s **John the Theologian and His Paschal Gospel** in 2019 shows the fullest fruit of his hermeneutic. Reading the Fourth Gospel as a **paschal** book from beginning to end, he argues that the **Prologue** is itself an entrance into the Passion and that the **Logos** is known properly in the path Christ takes to the Father through death. The hallmark claim is that Christian theology begins at the **Cross** with a retrospective comprehension of **Scripture** and only then moves forward to the articulation of **Trinitarian dogma**. The Johannine idiom of **glory**, **hour**, and **new creation** confirms Behr’s thesis of **eschatological protology**. In this reading, the confession of **homoousios** appears not as a metaphysical formula imposed on the text but as the compressed affirmation of what John narrates and the Church celebrates at **Pascha**.

This Johannine focus reinforces Behr’s commitment to **apophatic theology**. The revelation of the **Father** in the Son remains irreducible to creaturely categories even as it is given to us in the **economy**. The divine **simplicity** and **unity** are confessed through the one work of the **Trinity**, a theme later elaborated by pro-Nicene theologians and appropriated by Behr as a guideline for doctrinal coherence. The **Gospel of John** thus becomes a school of **contemplation** and a rule for **exegesis** in which participation, obedience, and praise are intrinsic to theological understanding.

#### 8. Ecclesial pedagogy, liturgy, and the Popular Patristics project
Throughout his career, Behr has coupled scholarship with ecclesial pedagogy. As a long-time editor of the **SVS Press Popular Patristics Series**, he has overseen translations and introductions that place **patristic texts** in the hands of clergy and laity, reinforcing the conviction that **doctrine** arises from the Church’s patient reading of **Scripture**. His deanship at **St Vladimir’s Seminary** was marked by curricular emphasis on **biblical theology**, **patristics**, and **liturgy**, embodying the claim that the **Eucharist** and **baptism** are the matrix of **dogmatic** formation. Behr frequently cites the monastic axiom of **Evagrius** that the true **theologian** is one who prays, turning that into a program that unites academic rigor with ascetical and liturgical practice.

This pastoral orientation resists the privatization of theology into university discourse. For Behr, the **Church** is the habitat of theological reason, and the **rule of faith** is the grammar of Christian speech learned in doxology. The Church’s **martyrs** and **monastics** become canonical interpreters because they embody the **mystery of Christ**. Such an ecclesial orientation, while not dismissive of critical history, refuses to permit **historicism** to override the interpretive primacy of **Pascha**. The retrieval of the Fathers is therefore neither antiquarian nor polemical but a renewal of the living tradition that sings the same **Cross** across times and cultures.

#### 9. Dialogue and debate in contemporary theology
Behr’s work occupies a place of ongoing dialogue with significant contemporary figures. With **John Zizioulas** he shares an emphasis on **ecclesiology** and **personhood**, yet Behr places the weight of theological identity not on metaphysics of person but on the **paschal** enactment of personhood in the **Body of Christ**. With **Robert Jenson** he shares a narrative and **Christocentric** bent, though Behr resists narrativist construals that risk dissolving **divine simplicity** into history. With **Rowan Williams**, **Lewis Ayres**, and **Khaled Anatolios**, he debates the fine grain of **Nicene** trinitarianism while underscoring the primacy of **exegesis** over system-building. He also stands near **Brevard Childs** and **Hans Frei** on **canonical** and **figural** reading, though his insistence on **liturgical** and sacramental participation gives his position a thicker ecclesial texture than some versions of postliberalism.

The knot of controversy arises around his judicious rehabilitation of **Origen**, his strong construal of **theosis**, and his insistence that **doctrine** is the Church’s paschal rereading of **Scripture** rather than a timeless system. Critics worry that such a posture might underplay **metaphysical** clarity or license allegorical excess, though Behr replies with the safeguard of the **rule of faith** and the calibrating force of **martyrdom** and **asceticism**. In the larger field of contemporary **ressourcement**, his voice exemplifies an Orthodox retrieval that is neither defensive nor merely nostalgic, marked instead by confidence that the **Cross** remains the form of Christian knowing.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a classical **Reformed** and **Westminster Theological Seminary** vantage, substantial convergences with Behr are immediately apparent. The priority of **Christ** for **Scripture’s unity**, the prominence of **Luke 24** for hermeneutics, the indispensability of the **rule of faith** as a summary of biblical truth, and the retrieval of **figural reading** align with a robust **history of redemption** approach. His insistence that **dogma** arises as an ecclesial response to **revelation** rather than through autonomous reason resonates with **Reformed** critiques of rationalism. Moreover, his stress on the **Cross and Resurrection** as the epistemic key accords with a covenantal focus on **Christ’s mediatorial work** and the unity of **Old** and **New** covenants in the one economy of God’s grace. Yet principled tensions remain. First, the authority of the **regula fidei** in Behr’s account functions as an ecclesial canon that can appear to stand alongside **sola Scriptura**, whereas a **Reformed** rule is normed entirely by Scripture and expressed in **confessions** with a ministerial rather than magisterial status. Second, the thick **sacramental realism** that animates his ecclesiology and his account of **theosis** presses beyond classic **Reformed** accounts of **Word and sacrament** and threatens to blur the distinction between **justification** and **sanctification**, where the **Reformed** tradition insists on free acceptance in **Christ** by imputation as the ground of any participatory transformation. Third, his emphasis on **paschal exegesis** as the engine of doctrinal development risks downplaying the role of providentially ordered **covenants** and the clarity of **Scripture’s literal sense**, long championed in **Reformed** hermeneutics as the bedrock of the spiritual sense. A constructive appropriation would affirm Behr’s **Christocentric figuration**, reinforce it by explicit **covenant theology** that guards the **perspicuity of Scripture**, and retain **theosis** as sanctification by union with Christ while articulating **justification** through **Christ’s righteousness** as logically prior. Such calibrations allow **Reformed** theology to receive Behr’s paschal insights without ceding its commitments to **sola Scriptura**, **solus Christus**, and the federal shape of **redemptive history**.
