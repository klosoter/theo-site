### ESSAY
Eleonore Stump stands as a principal architect of **analytic Thomism**, drawing **Aquinas** into the center of contemporary **philosophical theology** while reframing familiar disputes about **evil**, **freedom**, and **atonement** through the category of **second-person experience**. Trained in analytic philosophy in the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s and long based at **Saint Louis University**, Stump contributed to the Anglophone revival of **classical theism** alongside figures such as **Norman Kretzmann**, **Brian Davies**, and **John Haldane**. Her career tracks the maturation of analytic philosophy of religion after **Alvin Plantinga** and **Richard Swinburne**, yet she refuses the dichotomy between **the God of the philosophers** and **the God of the Bible**. Her work in the 1980s on **eternity** and **divine simplicity**, her co-editing of **The Cambridge Companion to Aquinas** in 1993, and her monographs **Aquinas** 2003 and **Wandering in Darkness** 2010 together establish a distinctive method: historically rooted **Thomism** expressed with analytic rigor and disciplined by **narrative** and **second-person** knowledge.

At the level of method, Stump unites **metaphysical realism** and **virtue epistemology** with a twofold account of human knowing that she labels **Dominican** and **Franciscan**. The **Dominican** mode privileges propositions, demonstration, and *scientia*. The **Franciscan** mode highlights **acquaintance**, **narrative** comprehension, and the **second-person stance**, in which one encounters another as a thou. In **Wandering in Darkness** 2010 she argues that the philosophy of religion has overindexed on Dominican knowing and must recover the rational force of **narrative understanding** and **second-person presence**. This turn is not anti-rational. It is a specification of **Aquinas's** own hierarchy of **habitus** and modes of participation in truth, extended by attention to contemporary **cognitive science** on **empathy** and **mindreading** and informed by **Augustinian** moral psychology of **love** as willing the good of the other for the other's sake. In Stump's hands, **Thomistic metaphysics** grounds the reality of persons and universal natures, while **narrative rationality** legitimately functions as data and as a way of seeing.

Stump's early and continuing work on **divine simplicity** and **eternity** anchors her classical commitments. With **Kretzmann** she authored the influential article **Eternity** 1981, retrieving **Boethius's** account of divine **atemporality** as tota simul, the whole of life present all at once. She defends the coherence of **eternal simultaneity** and its utility for resolving puzzles in **foreknowledge**, **immutability**, and **impassibility** without lapsing into deism. God is **simple**, without metaphysical composition, and thus not a being among beings. In subsequent essays she argues that divine **simplicity** entails not indifference but the unfragmented intensity of **love**, so that classical **impassibility** denotes the absence of passion in the sense of passivity, not the absence of **agape**. Against critics such as **William Hasker** and **Brian Leftow**, she maintains that **divine eternity** does not block **omnipresence** or **indwelling**, since the eternal God can be present to each temporal moment by intentional act without temporal succession. These commitments flow from **Aquinas's** doctrine of **act and potency**, **esse** as the act of being, and the **analogia entis**, and they frame all of Stump's later constructive proposals.

Within this classical frame Stump develops a nuanced account of **freedom** and **providence**. She is a defender of **libertarian freedom**, insisting on genuine alternative possibilities at least in the deep past of character formation and the sourcehood of action. She revises **Ockhamist** insights about **foreknowledge** by joining them to **Boethian** eternity. God timelessly knows free choices without determining them, because divine knowledge tracks truthmakers that include the free act itself. In debate with **Peter van Inwagen** on the consequence argument and with **John Martin Fischer** on semi-compatibilism, Stump contends that **responsibility** requires more than mere guidance control; it includes a healed **will** whose liberum arbitrium flows from right order of intellect and love. The language of **healing of the will** is not metaphor for Stump. It names a deep **Augustinian** and **Thomistic** diagnosis: the human heart is dis-integrated by sin and must be integrated through **grace** for genuine freedom. These discussions set the stage for her approach to **the problem of evil** and **atonement**.

The centerpiece of Stump's engagement with **evil** is **Wandering in Darkness** 2010. Here she claims that standard theodicy misses the mark because it moves almost entirely in the **Dominican** register. She proposes that at least some vexing features of suffering can be understood only within **Franciscan** knowledge, the kind gained by **narrative** and by **second-person presence**. The book offers close readings of **Job**, **Abraham and Sarah**, **Samson**, and **Mary of Bethany**. Through these biblical narratives Stump argues that God aims not merely at soul-making in general but at **union** with persons, a second-personal communion that requires the integration of will and the remedy of shame, guilt, and alienation. She deploys Thomistic distinctions in **will** between the desiderative and the elective and draws upon **attachment theory** to illuminate how **divine hiddenness** can serve the healing of the self. Against **William Rowe's** evidential argument, she offers a **defense** shaped by narrative: it is consistent with God's **goodness** and **wisdom** that certain horrendous sufferings might be permitted because they are necessary for a person's **union with God** and for the lovelier good of second-personal presence that could not otherwise be secured.

The same trajectory informs **The God of the Bible and the God of the Philosophers** 2016, which grew out of her **Gifford Lectures**. The controlling claim is that there is no inherent conflict between **classical theism** and the rich **personal God** of Scripture. Stump resists the caricature that **divine simplicity** generates an inert actus purus unrelated to biblical covenant. By extended engagement with **Exodus**, **Psalms**, and **Johannine** themes of **indwelling** and **mutual love**, she contends that the metaphysics of **simplicity**, **eternity**, and **immutability** is precisely what sustains the resilient **faithfulness** of God in covenant history. Her key category of **second-person presence** functions here as a bridge. The same God who is beyond time is the God who can be present *ad intra* to the depths of a human soul, uniting without consuming. The book offers a hermeneutic: begin from the **analogia fidei** of Scripture's portrayal of God, interpret its anthropomorphisms theologically, and show how **Thomistic** metaphysics renders those portrayals intelligible.

Stump's **Atonement** 2018 is a culmination of her **Thomistic personalism**. Rejecting a reduction of atonement to any single model, she argues for a **Thomistic** account that centers on **satisfaction**, **merit**, and **forgiveness** as the healing of a fractured second-personal relationship. On her reading of **Aquinas**, atonement involves the removal of the impediments to **union with God**. Those impediments include both **guilt** and the disintegration of the **will**. Christ's passion provides **satisfaction** in that it offers to God something better than the debt of punishment, namely the supererogatory act of love of an innocent divine-human person. Christ also **merits** grace for the members of his body, effecting the infusion of virtues that restore the will to health. Stump criticizes crude versions of **penal substitution** in which God punishes an innocent as such. She instead argues that vicarious **satisfaction** can be coherent if it is grounded in the **Trinitarian** identity of the Son, his **consent**, and his **solidarity** with the human family. The result is a relational, restorative rendering of **atonement** that prioritizes **forgiveness** and the overcoming of alienation while retaining the seriousness of **justice** through a robust account of **satisfaction**.

The undergirding moral psychology of Stump's **atonement** recapitulates her account of **second-person love**. Love, on her **Augustinian-Thomistic** construal, has two desires: the good of the beloved and **union** with the beloved. Sin distorts both, so that human beings become averse to divine proximity and unable to will their highest good. Atonement must therefore include both **expiation** and **sanctification**. In Stump's idiom, Christ's work removes the barrier of **guilt** and secures the **grace** that heals the will, enabling genuine **freedom** and personal **presence** with God. In the economy of salvation, this is mediated by Christ's **body**, the **church**, and the **sacraments** that communicate the **infused virtues**. The end is not merely a legal status but **indwelling** and **friendship with God**. Here again the **Franciscan** attention to narrative meets the **Dominican** insistence on doctrinal clarity, yielding a synthesis in which **doctrine** articulates the space within which **narrative** discloses the face of God.

Throughout her corpus Stump debates the leading figures of contemporary **philosophical theology** while remaining anchored in **Aquinas**. She disputes **open theism** by emphasizing **eternity** and **providence**. She engages **Plantinga** and **van Inwagen** on **evil** and **freedom**, **Swinburne** on **simplicity** and **incarnation**, **Leftow** on **eternity**, and **Hasker** on **foreknowledge** and **impassibility**. Her argumentative style is analytic and precise, yet her constructive proposals rely on the rational credentials of **narrative** and the indispensability of **second-person presence**. The constant refrain is that salvation is **union with God**, a union whose metaphysical possibility is secured by **classical theism** and whose existential realization is made plausible by **Franciscan** modes of knowing and loving.

In sum, Stump's contribution is twofold: an authoritative, contemporary presentation of **Aquinas** across **metaphysics**, **anthropology**, and **soteriology**, and an innovative appeal to **narrative** and **second-person** categories to defend the **goodness of God** and expound **atonement**. Her **Aquinas** 2003 remains a touchstone for scholars of **Thomistic theology**. Her **Wandering in Darkness** 2010 reshaped debates on **evil** by legitimating **narrative rationality**. Her **Atonement** 2018 reconfigures the landscape of **soteriology** by relocating **satisfaction** in the dynamics of **love**, **union**, and **forgiveness**. These interventions have catalyzed ongoing work on **second-personal** accounts of **grace** and inspired new conversations across **analytic theology**, **biblical studies**, and **pastoral theology**.

A Reformed and WTS evaluation registers both consonance and friction. On **classical theism**, Stump's vigorous defense of **divine simplicity**, **eternity**, and **immutability** converges with the best of **Reformed scholastic** commitments and can correct recent evangelical drift toward **theistic personalism**. Her insistence that **narrative** has rational force can aid **biblical theology** by resisting reduction of **revelation** to bare propositions. Yet tensions remain over **libertarian freedom**, which sits uneasily with **Reformed compatibilism**, **effectual calling**, and the monergistic structure of **grace** in **covenant** history. Likewise her critique of **penal substitution** will be judged inadequate where **federal headship**, **covenant of works and grace**, and **Calvin's autotheos** underpin a juridical dimension of **atonement** integral to **forensic justification**. A Reformed alternative would receive Stump's **satisfaction** and **healing-of-the-will** emphases while insisting that **penal substitution** is not a crude divine child abuse but the covenantal act of the incarnate **Son** as federal head bearing curse **ad extra** in perfect **Trinitarian** harmony. Within a principium of **Scripture** as self-authenticating and a doctrine of **providence** ordered by **decree**, Stump's **second-person** insights can be received as descriptive of sanctification and communion, while **compatibilist freedom** and covenantal **atonement** preserve the architecture of **Reformed** soteriology.
