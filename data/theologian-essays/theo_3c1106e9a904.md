### ESSAY
Kirk R. MacGregor stands as a leading evangelical interpreter and constructive advocate of **Molinism**, the seventeenth-century Jesuit account of **divine providence** that centers on **scientia media**, or middle knowledge. Formed within the late modern resurgence of **analytic theology** and the evangelical return to **early modern scholasticism**, his work situates **Luis de Molina** within the Jesuit-Dominican controversies over **grace**, **freedom**, and the **decree**, and then recasts those debates for contemporary discussions with **Calvinism** and **Open Theism**. The hallmark of MacGregor’s contribution is a rigorous defense of **libertarian freedom** under the sovereignty of God, coupled with a free church and **Anabaptist** concern for discipleship and mission, all framed by the evangelical commitments to **Scripture**, **Trinity**, and **atonement**. His scholarship is both historical and systematic, arguing that **scientia media** is not a speculative curiosity but a constructive key for **predestination**, **theodicy**, **prayer**, and the **missio Dei**.

MacGregor’s method is explicitly **analytic-scholastic**, drawing on the precision of **analytic philosophy of religion** and the conceptual architecture of **Second Scholasticism** to clarify loci in **systematic theology**. He commends a **reformed epistemology** stance after **Alvin Plantinga**, contending that belief in the God of **Scripture** can be properly basic while nonetheless supported by cumulative **philosophical** and **historical** arguments. His exegesis centers on biblical **counterfactuals**, such as **1 Samuel 23** and **Matthew 11**, in which God discloses what free agents would do under alternate circumstances, thereby underwriting **middle knowledge**. He pursues this exegetical-philosophical synthesis with a free church sensibility, emphasizing **believer’s baptism**, **nonviolence**, and **discipleship** as the ecclesial horizon within which divine **providence** and creaturely **freedom** are lived. The result is a method that prizes conceptual clarity, hermeneutical attentiveness, and pastoral traction without conceding the classical claims about **divine perfection** *ad intra*.

The keystone of MacGregor’s historical retrieval is his monograph **Luis de Molina: The Life and Theology of the Founder of Middle Knowledge**, 2015, which reconstructs Molina’s life and the **De auxiliis** debates with **Domingo Banez** over **grace** and **freedom**. MacGregor argues that Molina’s **scientia media** is a distinct logical moment in the divine **knowledge** of counterfactuals of creaturely freedom, strictly prevolitional and prior to the **decree**, yet not reducible to the **natural knowledge** of mere possibilities or the **free knowledge** of actualities. Against **Banezian physical premotion**, Molina and MacGregor reject a causal determination of free acts, insisting that God knows what any creature would freely do in any complete set of circumstances. MacGregor also highlights the Jesuit doctrine of **congruism**, according to which God orders a world such that the distribution of **grace** is congruent with the foreknown free responses of persons, thereby securing **predestination** and **perseverance** without violating **libertarian freedom**. His historical thesis maintains that far from being a late scholastic novelty, **middle knowledge** codified long-standing biblical intuitions about divine counterfactual cognition and providential governance.

Constructively, MacGregor earlier integrated Molinist metaphysics with free church convictions in **A Molinist-Anabaptist Systematic Theology**, 2007, offering a compact account of **God**, **creation**, **Christ**, **salvation**, and **church** ordered by **scientia media**. The work explores **predestination** as God’s selection of a feasible world in which persons are placed in circumstances where they would freely respond to **prevenient grace**, a position that rejects **unconditional election** and **irresistible grace** yet denies **Open Theism’s** limitation of divine foreknowledge. On this model, **justification** and **sanctification** are gifts of grace applied to those whom God knew would freely embrace **Christ** under the Spirit’s enabling. Ecclesiologically, the volume ties **discipleship** and **mission** to a robust **providence**, claiming that evangelistic encounters are providentially orchestrated through God’s middle knowledge of human dispositions and social matrices. The ethical accent on **nonviolence** and **peacemaking** is also construed as congruent with a God who sovereignly orders history by wise placement rather than coercive determination.

MacGregor’s Molinism bears directly on the perennial problems of **evil**, **suffering**, and **prayer**, proposing a theodicy that preserves divine **goodness** and creaturely responsibility. Drawing on the standard Molinist repertoire including **transworld depravity** and **feasible worlds**, he contends that God selects a world with the optimal balance of moral and redemptive goods where the maximal number of persons would freely come to saving faith, all things considered. He is cautious about hard versions of **transworld damnation**, preferring to speak of God’s **optimal plan** that integrates human histories, intercessory **prayer**, and missionary obedience known through **counterfactuals of freedom**. On this account, **petitionary prayer** functions as an instrument of providence because God has already factored into the decree what free agents would do were they to be prompted to pray, thus upholding both the sincerity of prayer and the efficacy of supplication without collapsing into fatalism. Similar lines extend to **biblical inspiration**, where God’s providential ordering of authors, communities, and contexts secures the production of **Scripture** through genuinely human literary acts that remain free yet enfolded within the divine **decree**.

A complementary strand in his corpus is pedagogical and synthetic, exemplified by **Contemporary Theology: An Introduction**, 2019, where MacGregor maps the field across **classical**, **evangelical**, **philosophical**, and **practical** approaches. Here he positions **Molinism** within the wider landscape of **classical theism**, **Open Theism**, **process thought**, **neo-Thomism**, and **analytic theology**, often using debates over **providence**, **foreknowledge**, and **freedom** as test cases for methodological stances. The textbook displays his pedagogical aim to train evangelicals to read **Barth**, **Rahner**, **Pannenberg**, **liberation theologies**, and **analytic philosophers** with critical charity, while developing constructive proposals anchored in **Trinitarian** orthodoxy and **biblical theology**. The significance of this work is less in novel theses and more in curating a coherent intellectual map in which **scientia media** emerges as a live, defensible option for evangelicals navigating contemporary doctrinal disputes.

MacGregor’s cumulative defense of **middle knowledge** addresses the central philosophical challenge known as the **grounding objection**, according to which there are no truthmakers for counterfactuals of libertarian free acts. He follows and develops lines found in **Thomas Flint**, namely that such counterfactuals are grounded not in divine volition but in the essences and circumstances of possible creatures as comprehended by the divine intellect, and known by God in a logically prevolitional way. This maintains the crucial Molinist thesis that **CCFs** are not determined by God’s will, thereby protecting **libertarian freedom**, yet are not brute facts unrelated to reality because they supervene on creaturely essences and maximal circumstances as apprehended by an omniscient God. Against **Paul Helm** and other **compatibilists**, he argues that such grounding neither compromises **divine aseity** nor renders God dependent on the world, since the full modal space of essences and circumstances is eternally and simply known in God’s own intellectual act. In biblical theology he underscores divine statements of what would happen under counterfactual antecedents, presenting these texts as canonical markers that God’s knowledge includes true subjunctive conditionals about free agents.

Engagement with rival models shapes MacGregor’s constructive posture, and here he is a persistent interlocutor with **Open Theism** and **determinist Calvinism**. He charges **Open Theism** as espoused by **John Hasker** and **Greg Boyd** with diminishing divine **omniscience** and undercutting strong **providence** by denying that there are truths about future free acts to be known. He disputes **hard compatibilism** as defended by **Bruce Ware** and others by arguing that if every act is infallibly rendered certain by God’s determining decree, then the spontaneity and alternatives required for moral responsibility are evacuated. The Molinist alternative, he claims, threads the needle by affirming exhaustive **foreknowledge**, meticulous **providence**, and robust **freedom**, while permitting a rich account of **petitionary prayer**, **evangelism**, and **guidance**. He also engages **neo-Thomists** on **simplicity**, contending that a timeless, simple God can know distinct logical moments without temporal succession, safeguarding **immutability** while preserving the logical order central to **scientia media**.

Two pastoral themes recur in MacGregor’s essays and lectures on **mission** and **discipleship**, illustrating the spirituality of **Molinist** providence. First, he frames **evangelism** within a wise **providence** where God has placed persons in relational networks and historical junctures such that, given their dispositions and contexts, they would freely receive the gospel under faithful witness. Second, he relates **assurance** and **perseverance** to **congruism**, proposing that God orders the believer’s life with grace congruent to their free endurance, such that perseverance is genuinely God’s gift and truly the believer’s act. These applications extend to **ethics**, where **nonviolence** and **peacemaking** are not denials of divine rule but the very mode by which a God of patient wisdom governs a free moral order toward the cruciform telos revealed in **Christ**. The animating conviction is that the God of **Scripture** accomplishes his purposes not by overriding agency but by skillfully weaving human acts into the tapestry of his **kingdom**.

In sum, MacGregor’s enduring thesis is that **Molinism** provides evangelicals with a theologically and philosophically adequate account of **providence** that honors **biblical revelation**, secures **divine sovereignty**, and preserves **libertarian freedom**. His historical recovery of **Molina**, constructive integration with **Anabaptist** ecclesial commitments, and pedagogical mapping of **contemporary theology** together model a style of evangelical systematics that is historically informed, analytically precise, and pastorally oriented. The broad aim is neither capitulation to **determinism** nor retreat to **indeterminism**, but a via media grounded in **scientia media** as the hinge between divine **omniscience** and creaturely **action**.

Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary readers can appreciatively receive MacGregor’s defense of exhaustive **omniscience**, robust **providence**, and high **Trinitarian** dogmatics, yet they will demur at key points where **Molinism** strains classical **Reformed** commitments. Chiefly, placing contingent counterfactuals logically prior to the **decree** threatens **divine aseity** and the unqualified ultimacy of the **eternal decree**, even if no temporal dependence is implied. The Reformed account of **compatibilist freedom** under **concursus** can secure responsibility without positing autonomous creaturely counterfactuals outside the decree, while **effectual calling** and **definite atonement** safeguard the efficacy of grace apart from **congruism**. On method, the Reformed emphasis on the **covenantal economy** and the priority of **revelation** may judge the Molinist appeal to a fine-grained modal metaphysics as an unnecessary explanatory surplus. A classical alternative would reiterate the simplicity of the divine act, the asymmetry of the **two wills of God**, and the comprehensive scope of the **decree**, grounding assurance and mission in **sovereign grace** rather than in an antecedent array of creaturely counterfactuals. Still, MacGregor’s work presses Reformed theology to state with greater clarity how **sovereignty**, **holiness**, and **human agency** coinhere within the covenantal drama of redemption.
