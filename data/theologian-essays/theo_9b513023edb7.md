### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, resistance, and the turn to la technique
Jacques Ellul, born in 1912 in Bordeaux and deceased in 1994, stands at the intersection of **French Protestantism**, **legal scholarship**, and a prophetic sociology of **la technique**. Educated in law and history at Bordeaux and Paris, he approached early adulthood captivated by **Karl Marx** yet decisively redirected by **Karl Barth** and Scripture toward a **dialectical theology** that refuses both humanistic optimism and despair. His lifelong friendship with **Bernard Charbonneau** in the 1930s forged the vocabulary through which he would later anatomize the totalizing drift of **technical rationality**. Removed from his university post under Vichy, working the land in the Dordogne, then aiding the **French Resistance** and serving briefly in the postliberation municipal government, Ellul saw the modern **state** as an apparatus transformed by **technique** rather than neutral instrument. These experiences set the trajectory for his dual vocation: professor of law and history at Bordeaux and lay theologian interpreting the **Word of God** for the *saeculum* dominated by the **autonomous technological system**.

Ellul insisted that Christian witness must be uttered from below the powers, not enthroned in them, a posture already clear in **The Presence of the Kingdom** 1948. The future belonged not to reformist schemes but to the **kerygma** itself, the proclaimed **Gospel** that judges and frees. The biographical pressure of war, occupation, and bureaucratic complicity did not produce a simplistic **Christian Realism** in the mold of **Reinhold Niebuhr**. Instead, Ellul concluded that modernity is organized by a new **dominion** whose name is **technique**, and that the **ekklesia** must relearn the discipline of **non-power**.

#### 2. Method: dialectic, demythologization, and biblical realism
Ellul’s method fuses **dialectical theology** and empirical **sociology**. He reads Scripture to hear the **Word of God** that addresses us *coram Deo*, while he reads society to expose the **myths** by which the powers secure consent. The dialectic is not a Hegelian synthesis but the biblical tension of **grace and judgment**, **freedom and necessity**, **revelation and history**. He refuses scholastic **system-building**, preferring an open yet stringent method: name the **idol**, listen to the **kerygma**, then delineate the concrete **ethical** space opened by the Spirit in the midst of the world’s structures. His use of **demythologization** differs from Bultmann. It is not a stripping of biblical miracle claims but an unmasking of the **sacral aura** that attaches to **politics**, **science**, and **technology**. The result is what Ellul called a **biblical realism** that is starkly historical and political in effect but anchored in the **sovereignty of God** and the eschatological **Kingdom**.

At the epistemic level Ellul is antidogmatic about the **church’s institutions** and dogmatic about the **lordship of Christ**. He counters the Enlightenment’s **autonomy** with the biblical **theonomy** that calls human beings out of bondage into **freedom for** obedience. Yet, because **la technique** generates a quasi-natural **necessity**, Ellul insists that the Christian’s yes and no must be spoken within an environment that increasingly renders choices **heteronomous**. This generates the hallmark Ellulian theme: the **dialectic** of **necessity** in the world and **freedom** in Christ.

#### 3. The Technological Society: autonomy, necessity, and monism of technique
Ellul’s central sociological thesis is articulated in **The Technological Society** 1954. **La technique** names not discrete tools but the ensemble of methods that privilege **efficiency** as the supreme criterion. He identifies properties by which the system advances: **autonomy** from moral, political, or religious constraints; **self-augmentation** through feedback and compounding innovation; **universalism** that extends technique to all domains; **automatism** that demands adoption once a technique is available; and **monism** that binds techniques into an integrated whole. In dialogue with **Max Weber** on rationalization and with **Martin Heidegger** on enframing, Ellul claims that modern society has passed from a human use of tools to a **technical milieu** that uses humans.

In this milieu, historical actors confront a necessity that is not divine **providence** but a man-made **fate**. Technique dissolves traditional **mediations** and **normative orders**, replacing them with programmable procedures and administrative **systems**. The idol is not the machine but the theological transvaluation by which the **efficient** becomes the **good**. Ellul’s prose returns again and again to the scriptural motif of **principalities and powers**. The result is not Manichean dualism but the biblical sense that fallen powers acquire creaturely **dominion** that must be named, resisted, and ultimately subordinated to **Christ’s** victory.

#### 4. Propaganda and the Political Illusion: formation of consent in a technical state
In **Propaganda** 1962 Ellul extends his analysis: modern **propaganda** is not a marginal tool of tyrannies but a structural instrument of the **technological society**, indispensable even to democracies. He distinguishes **agitation** propaganda that mobilizes and **integration** propaganda that quietly shapes habits, desires, and horizons. Mass **media**, educational **systems**, and public relations do not primarily inform but integrate the person into the **technical ensemble** by supplying frames that make the system appear natural. Propaganda is necessary to maintain the **political illusion**, the collective belief that voting or policy-work remains decisive where **technical imperatives** already set the agenda.

In **The Political Illusion** 1965 Ellul argues that the modern **state** is increasingly an administrative regulator of techniques, and that politics becomes spectacular yet epiphenomenal. He is here both close to and critical of **Reinhold Niebuhr**. Like Niebuhr he exposes moralistic illusions, yet unlike Niebuhr he does not retain confidence that the **state** can be an instrument of proximate justice. Political acts are not meaningless, but their meaning is **ambiguous** within the **technical monism**. The Christian task is not to sacralize the **polis** but to maintain a posture of critical **distance**, refusing consecration while practicing limited, neighborly **service**.

#### 5. Presence of the Kingdom and the Meaning of the City: eschatology and the powers
Ellul’s explicitly theological works align his sociology with **biblical eschatology**. In **The Presence of the Kingdom** 1948 he asserts that the **Kingdom of God** is not identified with cultural progress or institutional reform. The Kingdom is present as **judgment** and **grace**, inaugurating a new obedience in the midst of the world’s orders. In **The Meaning of the City** English 1970 he reads the **city** from **Genesis** to **Revelation** as the ambivalent locus of human **autonomy** and divine **visitation**. Babel and Babylon embody the will to self-organization, while the **New Jerusalem** witnesses to the redeemed city bestowed from above. The powers that seize the city are the **archai kai exousiai**, the **principalities and powers**, which for Ellul are social structures that attain quasi-personal persistence.

Ellul’s ecclesial vision is consequent. The **church** is not to be a sacral power among powers. It is the **ekklesia** called to embody the **presence of the Kingdom** by concrete acts of **hospitality**, **truth-telling**, and **nonconformity**. He warns in **The Subversion of Christianity** 1984 that Christendom constantly reverses the Gospel, converting **grace** into **law** and **freedom** into **order**. Hence the famous Ellulian claim for a form of **Christian anarchism**, expounded in **Anarchy and Christianity** 1988, which names not chaos but a principled refusal to attribute ultimacy to any human **authority**.

#### 6. Ethics of Freedom: command of God, situational wisdom, and pneumatology
The ethical core appears in **The Ethics of Freedom** 1973 and **To Will and To Do** 1964. Ellul rejects casuistry and fixed **natural-law** conclusions in favor of a biblical ethics grounded in the **command of God**, heard anew by the believer in the concrete **situation**. The dialectic of **lex et evangelium** means the law convicts while the **Gospel** liberates, so that ethical agency is a gift of the **Holy Spirit** rather than a synthesis of principles. He sees **sin** as bondage expressed today through the pervasive necessities of **la technique**, while **freedom** is the Spirit’s opening of a surprising path of **obedience** within that bondage.

Ellul’s ethics is sometimes described as situational. He prefers to call it **pneumatological** and **eschatological**. The believer acts because in Christ the future is already present as **freedom for love**. Ellul refuses both antinomian spontaneity and legalist rigidity. What he calls for is a discernment guided by Scripture’s narrative **kerygma**, practiced in prayer, and critical of collective **myths**. The aim is not success in the **system** but fidelity to the **Word** that alone creates new possibilities in what appears closed by **necessity**.

#### 7. The Humiliation of the Word: Word, image, and visibility
In **The Humiliation of the Word** 1981 Ellul undertakes a theological epistemology. Modernity exalts the **image**, the visible and manipulable, at the expense of the **Word**, the heard address that cannot be controlled. In a culture of screens, graphs, and spectacle the human is habituated to visibility, which fits the **technical** canon of **efficiency** and **control**. The **Word of God** by contrast frees by calling the hearer to trust what is not seen. Ellul therefore develops the contrast **kerygma vs image** to defend the epistemic shape of **faith**.

This is not iconoclasm simpliciter; it is an analysis of the **regime of visibility** that feeds **propaganda** and the **political illusion**. For Ellul even the **incarnation** is understood as the **Word** that became flesh, not as a transmission of salvific images. The **sacraments** belong to the economy of the **Word**, signs that point beyond themselves rather than objects of technical manipulation. The humility of the **Word** is precisely the humiliation he names: the world counts it as weakness, while the **Gospel** knows it as power.

#### 8. Later critiques: system, bluff, and the practice of non-power
In **The Technological System** 1977 Ellul revises his earlier account by emphasizing integration. Technique has consolidated into a **system** whose interdependencies make abstention or selective rollback nearly impossible. The question is no longer whether we can or should adopt a given technique. Adoption is presupposed by the **system’s** logic. In **The Technological Bluff** 1988 he targets the rhetoric of **innovation**, **risk**, and **progress** that promises control while masking dependence. The bluff is a cultural **myth** indispensable to keep populations investing money, attention, and legitimacy in the **technical ensemble**.

Ellul does not counsel withdrawal into purity. He commends **resistance** as small-scale, local, concrete acts of **non-power** that interrupt the **automatism** of technique. He pairs such counsel with theological insistence that only **God** finally liberates. Christian hope is thus realistic about history’s hardening yet unafraid to act. The believer lives as a sign of the **Kingdom** within a world ordered by **necessity**, trusting that God’s **eschaton** transvalues what the system deems rational.

#### 9. Interlocutors, affinities, and reception
Ellul’s dialogue with **Karl Marx** grounds his sensitivity to **structures** and **alienation**, even as he rejects Marxist soteriology and economic determinism in favor of a new determinism, that of **technique**. With **Max Weber** he shares an analysis of **rationalization**, yet Ellul presses beyond to the monistic closure of the **technical milieu**. His proximity to **Martin Heidegger** on technology’s essence is real, but Ellul refuses ontological fatalism by insisting on **biblical revelation** and **pneumatological freedom**. In social thought he stands apart from **Reinhold Niebuhr’s** cautious use of power and from **Jacques Maritain’s** Christian **humanism**, charging both with underestimating the **autonomy** of technique. He walks alongside **Ivan Illich** and **Bernard Charbonneau** in patient critiques of institutionalized systems.

Reception has been uneven. Secular readers prize **The Technological Society** and **Propaganda** while bracketing the **Gospel**. Christian readers often reverse the pattern. In North America both **evangelicals** and **mainline Protestants** have mined Ellul for critiques of **consumerism**, **media**, and **civil religion**. Some **neo-Calvinists** employ his warnings about **idolatry** while preferring **Kuyperian** strategies of cultural engagement. His commentaries, including **Apocalypse** 1977 and **The Judgment of Jonah** 1957, have nourished pastors seeking to preach against the **powers**. Ellul remains an unmistakable voice whose **antithesis Word vs world** exposes the late-modern heart.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: antithesis without creation mandate
A Reformed evaluation must begin with gratitude for Ellul’s ruthless naming of modern **idolatry**, his defense of **sola Scriptura** as living **Word**, and his insistence on the **antithesis** between **Gospel** and the **autonomous technological system**. His reading of the **principalities and powers** helps unmask the presumption that modern **politics**, **economics**, and **media** are neutral. Yet tensions with classical **Reformed orthodoxy** are significant. First, Ellul’s **dialectical theology** often yields a thin doctrine of **creation**, **providence**, and **common grace**, tending toward cultural **pessimism** where the Reformed confess God’s **goodness** in created structures and the legitimacy of **vocation** under **providence**. Second, his **Christian anarchism** conflicts with Reformed doctrine of the **civil magistrate**, which sees the state as God’s minister for justice within the **twofold kingdom** order or in Kuyperian terms as a distinct **sphere** under Christ. Third, his polemical **kerygma vs image** risks eclipsing the Reformed account of **Word and sacrament**, where the **visible Word** of baptism and the Supper are instituted means of grace rather than capitulations to the regime of **visibility**. Fourth, his non-inerrantist view of **Scripture** and suspicion of **dogmatics** do not sit easily with confessional **Reformed** commitments to the clarity, authority, and truthfulness of the **inscripturated Word**. A constructive alternative within the Reformed frame would retain Ellul’s idol critique and his vigilance about **propaganda**, but would locate cultural engagement within a **covenantal** theology of **creation and redemption**, affirming the **cultural mandate**, practicing principled **sphere sovereignty**, recovering **Sabbath** practices that resist **efficiency**, and cultivating **wisdom** that neither sacralizes nor demonizes **technique** but orders it to neighbor-love under the **lordship of Christ**.
