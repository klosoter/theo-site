### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Gordon T. Smith emerges from late twentieth century **evangelicalism** with a vocation that is both academic and pastoral, shaped by cross-cultural service and institutional leadership. Ordained in the **Christian and Missionary Alliance**, Smith spent significant years in the Philippines, a ministry context that pressed him toward an ecclesially thick and globally aware **missiology**. His doctoral formation at the Jesuit **Loyola School of Theology** in Manila gave him fluency in Catholic sources and a taste for **ressourcement**, even as his teaching at **Regent College** and later presidency at **Ambrose University** kept him solidly within the evangelical family. That dual belonging produces a characteristic blend: evangelical convictions about **conversion**, **Scripture**, and **mission** joined to a catholic sense of **sacrament**, **liturgy**, and ecclesial continuity.

Smith’s method is intentionally **practical-sapiential**, a theological wisdom ordered to the cure of souls and the formation of communities. He resists a merely cognitive **epistemology**, arguing in works like **Called to Be Saints** 2013 that knowledge is teleological and virtue-directed, oriented to participation in **Christ** rather than to abstract system. His writing is thus genre-bending: one finds in **Beginning Well** 2001 and **The Voice of Jesus** 2003 empirical pastoral observation, biblical-theological synthesis, and retrieval of classic voices such as **Augustine** and **Calvin**. The hallmark of his approach is an integrated **Word-Spirit-Sacrament** pattern, a conviction developed programmatically in **Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal** 2017, where he presses evangelicals toward catholic fullness without erosion of evangelical distinctives.

#### 2. The central problematic: conversion and the shape of initiation
The leitmotif across Smith’s corpus is **conversion**, but he insists that the subject must be reframed as **Christian initiation**. In **Beginning Well** 2001 he diagnoses the pathologies of **revivalist decisionism**, which reduces salvation to a punctiliar choice and treats evangelization as a marketing problem. Against this reduction, **Transforming Conversion** 2010 offers a constructive retrieval that maps initiation as an ordered, ecclesial, and sacramental reality. Smith proposes that the biblical and patristic witness understands initiation as a dynamic of **repentance and faith**, **baptism** into **union with Christ**, reception of the **Holy Spirit**, and incorporation into a **Eucharistic** community. He commends the catechumenate and the **RCIA** as practical wisdom, not as a wholesale import but as a heuristic for Protestant renovation of catechesis.

This turn from ordo salutis to **ordo initiationis** is not an abandonment of classical soteriology but a re-indexing of its loci to the lived economy of the church. Smith frequently appropriates **Augustine’s** narrative of desire in the **Confessions** to argue that true conversion is an affective and moral reorientation, which must be tested in **virtue** and **participatio Christi** rather than inferred from bare assent. He leans on **Calvin’s** doctrine of **union with Christ** to center initiation in the person of Christ rather than in human decision, and on **Wesley’s** language of **holiness** to insist that conversion is unto sanctification. The pastoral implication is decisive: initiate persons into a whole way of life through **catechesis**, communal practices, and sacramental participation, rather than producing decisions that float free of **ecclesial** belonging.

#### 3. Sacramental retrieval in evangelical register
Smith’s sacramental theology, distilled in **A Holy Meal** 2005 and advanced in **Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal** 2017, is a bid for **sacramental realism** that honors evangelical concern for the primacy of **Scripture** and the centrality of preaching. He resists both memorialism and transubstantiation as default polarities, aligning instead with a Calvinian account of **real spiritual presence** by the **Spirit** in the **Eucharist**. This realism is not speculative metaphysics but a practical claim that at the Table the risen Christ gives himself for the nourishment of his people. Smith accents **epiclesis**, the prayer for the Spirit’s work in the Supper, and retrieves **anamnesis** as the church’s Spirit-enabled remembering that is also participatory proclamation.

A parallel retrieval shapes his view of **baptism**. While wary of causal accounts that tie regeneration mechanistically to the rite, he insists in **Transforming Conversion** 2010 that baptism is not optional and not merely symbolic. Baptism is the gospel in visible word, the church’s normative practice of **initiation** into **union with Christ** and the **Triune** name. From **Alexander Schmemann** he borrows a sense of liturgy as the form of Christian life in the world, yet he interprets this through evangelical attentiveness to conversion and mission. The net effect is a doxological ecclesiology: **Word** proclaimed, **sacrament** enacted, **Spirit** invoked, and a people formed for holiness.

#### 4. Pneumatology and the discernment of spirits
Smith’s pneumatology is focused and ecclesial. In **The Voice of Jesus** 2003 he advances an account of **discernment of spirits** that tightly correlates the voice of the **Spirit** with the lordship of **Christ** and the canonical **Scriptures**. Discernment is not private intuition but a corporate habit tested by the rule of faith and the fruits of the **Spirit**. He resists both cessationist suspicion and uncritical charismatic exuberance, pressing for a Pentecostal sobriety that expects the **Spirit’s** active guidance while subjecting impressions to communal wisdom and liturgical discernment. Here again **Calvin’s** insistence on the **Spirit-Word** nexus is a key anchor, as is **Gordon Fee’s** exegetical work on Pauline pneumatology.

The charismatic dimension is never an add-on. In **Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal** 2017, Smith argues that the church is impoverished wherever one of these three descriptors is excluded. A merely evangelical church without sacrament becomes thin and voluntarist; a sacramental church without Pentecost becomes formal; a Pentecostal church without evangelical and sacramental depth becomes untethered. The integrative claim is that the **Spirit** animates the whole economy of **Word and sacrament**, and that guidance, gifts, and governance belong together. This ecclesial pneumatology undergirds his practical treatments of **spiritual direction** in the 2014 guide, where he outlines patterns of listening, testing, and confirming the **Spirit’s** voice in the life of a believer and a community.

#### 5. Holiness, vocation, and teleology of the Christian life
If initiation is the doorway, the house is **holiness**. In **Called to Be Saints** 2013 Smith articulates a teleology of the Christian life that is explicitly christological and virtue-shaped. Sanctification is participation in the **virtues** of Christ, ordered to love of God and neighbor, and sustained by the ordinary **means of grace**. His treatment is broad and pastoral, but it is also dogmatically significant because it locates **sanctification** within **union with Christ** and the life of the church rather than in solitary effort. The book argues for the recovery of communal practices such as confession, Sabbath, almsgiving, and hospitable table fellowship as instruments of the **Spirit’s** transformative work.

Alongside holiness stands **vocation**. **Courage and Calling** 1999 rev. 2011 and **Consider Your Calling** 2016 develop a theology of work and calling that is neither romantic nor world-denying. Smith differentiates between primary calling to **Christ**, secondary callings to particular tasks, and seasonal assignments within providence. He warns against idolatry of career and advocates for **virtue**-formed discernment that honors the church’s role in recognizing gifts. This vocational emphasis loops back to sacrament and discernment: the baptized are called into a Eucharistic community that discerns and blesses vocations for the sake of the world.

#### 6. Institutions, leadership, and the church in secular modernity
Smith’s ecclesial instincts are institutional as well as sacramental. In **Institutional Intelligence** 2017 and **Wisdom from Babylon** 2020 he makes a theological case for organizational competence as a Christian virtue. Institutions are vehicles of **common grace** and custodians of charisms; their wise governance is part of the church’s witness in a secular age. He diagnoses the cultural conditions of late modernity as Babylon-like, requiring exilic fidelity rather than triumphal control. The burden of these books is practical but their theological core is clear: because **providence** works through time and communities, spiritual leaders must cultivate competencies in governance, finance, and culture-making in tandem with **Word** and **sacrament**.

This institutional turn protects his sacramental vision from privatization. The practices of **catechesis**, **baptism**, and the **Lord’s Supper** depend on durable communities, not merely on events. Smith commends a pastoral imagination that prizes liturgical time, calendar wisdom, and stable rhythms as instruments of sanctification. The church’s capacity to endure in **secular modernity** is not by accommodation but by deeply rooted communal life that models a different economy of time, authority, and desire, animated by the **Spirit** and oriented to the kingdom.

#### 7. Evangelical, sacramental, pentecostal: an integrated proposal
The integrative apex of Smith’s project is **Evangelical, Sacramental, and Pentecostal** 2017, where he argues that the future of evangelical churches requires a threefold retrieval. Evangelical faith must be deeply **biblical** and oriented to proclamation of **Christ crucified and risen**, sacramentally thick with regular **Eucharist** and robust **baptismal** theology, and Pentecostally alive with expectation of the **Spirit’s** presence and gifts. He casts this not as syncretism but as catholicity, a re-centering of evangelicalism within the fullness of the church’s tradition. The book identifies ecclesial practices that enact this synthesis: weekly Communion with clear gospel preaching, catechumenal preparation for baptism, corporate **discernment** processes, and leadership that welcomes charisms while safeguarding order.

This synthesis is also missional. For Smith, the integrity of witness in a post-Christendom setting depends on communities that actually embody the gospel through sacramental participation and Spirit-led holiness. He sees **mission** not as technique but as the overflow of **communion** with the Triune God. Thus, **conversion** is not a detachable moment but a doorway into a people gathered by **Word**, nourished by **sacrament**, and sent in the power of the **Spirit**.

#### 8. Sources and interlocutors in service of an evangelical catholicity
Smith’s constructive work is dialogical. He appropriates **Augustine** for a thick account of desire and grace in **conversion**, **Calvin** for **union with Christ** and sacramental presence, and **Wesley** for practical holiness and accountable discipleship. From **Alexander Schmemann** he learns that liturgy is the heartbeat of ecclesial life, while from **Gordon Fee** he draws exegetical ballast for a living **pneumatology**. His conversation partners also include thinkers of mission such as **Lesslie Newbigin**, whose critique of Western privatization of faith underwrites Smith’s plea for public, sacramental witness. Yet he positions these interlocutors under an evangelical norm: **Scripture** as the supreme authority attested by the Spirit within the church.

That norming relation is clearest in **Transforming Conversion** 2010, where Smith appreciates the **RCIA** and catechumenate without collapsing evangelical convictions into a sacramental mechanism. He distinguishes between **signum** and **res**, between the sign and the res, the reality of grace, insisting that the **Spirit** is sovereign in giving life while also binding believers to the visible signs commanded by Christ. His writings, therefore, model an evangelical catholicity that is neither sectarian nor diffuse, aiming for a catholic fullness that remains genuinely evangelical.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
Reformed readers, including those shaped by the **Westminster Standards**, will find much to affirm in Smith’s work and several points to probe. The shared ground is weighty: a **Christocentric** and **Trinitarian** center, **union with Christ** as soteriological key, commitment to the ordinary **means of grace**, and suspicion of disembodied **decisionism**. His retrieval of **catechesis**, his Calvinian account of the **real spiritual presence** in the **Eucharist**, and his ecclesial orientation to **holiness** all resonate with classical Reformed instincts. Yet tensions appear at loci where his **ordo initiationis** proposal presses against Reformed dogmatic architecture. First, by framing salvation primarily through **initiation** rather than the **ordo salutis**, Smith risks blurring analytic clarity on **effectual calling**, **regeneration**, and **justification**. A Westminster account would insist on monergistic **regeneration** as logically prior to the acts of faith signified in **baptism**, even while strongly affirming baptism as a means of grace within the covenant. Second, his use of **RCIA**-like catechumenal patterns is pastorally rich but requires covenantal recalibration regarding **baptism** of believers and their children, the visible-invisible church distinction, and the objective promises that do not presume subjective conversion at the font. Third, his **discernment of spirits** framework admirably binds guidance to **Scripture** and community, yet a Reformed construal of **Sola Scriptura** will urge sharper boundaries for charismatic impressions, restricting the church to the sufficient and closed canon while welcoming the **Spirit’s** illumining work in providence and wisdom. Finally, the threefold schema of **evangelical, sacramental, and pentecostal** is compelling as a pedagogical triad, but a Reformed alternative would reframe it in covenantal terms as **Word**, **sacrament**, and **prayer**, the instituted means by which the **Spirit** builds the church. In sum, Smith’s project calls Reformed churches to fuller practice of their own confessed theology, while Reformed dogmatics offers him safeguards for distinguishing sign and thing signified, ensuring that grace remains sovereignly free and that the church’s life is normed by the sufficiency of Scripture within the covenant economy.
