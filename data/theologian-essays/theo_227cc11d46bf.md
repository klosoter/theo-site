### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
The career of **James Eglinton** unfolds at the intersection of **historical theology** and **systematic retrieval**, in a moment when the English-speaking world has rediscovered the wealth of **Dutch Neo-Calvinism** and the broad tradition of **Reformed catholicity**. Teaching at the **University of Edinburgh**, Eglinton has become a principal interpreter of **Herman Bavinck** for contemporary dogmatics, arguing that Bavinck is neither a museum piece nor a partisan slogan but a catholic Reformed theologian engaged with **modernity**. His method is conspicuously ecclesial and archival: biography, translation, and critical edition function as theological argument, not mere context. The result is a constructive historiography that treats **primary sources** as doctrinally fecund. This approach orients his signature claim: Bavinck’s thought coheres around an **organic trinitarian ontology** nourished by **archetypal-ectypal** distinctions, so that theology, ethics, science, and culture are differentiated yet integrated in the one truth of the **triune God**. Against piecemeal appropriation or ideological uses of **worldview**, Eglinton’s method insists on dogmatic first principles that are explicitly **Trinitarian**, **catholic**, and **churchly**.

#### 2. The organic motif and an anti-dualist thesis
Eglinton’s monograph **Trinity and Organism** (2012) established his basic thesis against the widespread **two Bavincks** narrative that portrays Bavinck as internally divided between confessional **orthodoxy** and modern **critical theology**. Through close reading of Dutch texts, he argues that the recurring language of organism is not a capitulation to **Hegelian** or **Romantic** holism but a disciplined metaphor for the unity-in-diversity of creation grounded in **Trinitarian doctrine**. On his reading, the **organic motif** flows from Bavinck’s dogmatic center: the one and three, the many in the one, and the principled distinction between **Creator and creature** preserved by the **archetype-ectype** grammar. This grammar also secures **divine simplicity** and the integrity of **Calvins autotheos** while enabling a robust account of **common grace**, **antithesis**, and cultural engagement. Eglinton thereby reframes Bavinck as a thinker whose encounter with **modern science**, **psychology**, and **historicism** is governed by **principia** drawn from revelation and Scripture, not a pendulum swing between incompatible loyalties. The result is a coherent **Neo-Calvinist** ontology that is neither romanticized organicism nor thin **worldviewism**.

#### 3. Biography as theology: the 2020 Bavinck
In **Herman Bavinck: Pastor, Churchman, Statesman, and Theologian** (2020), Eglinton advances a distinctive proposal: biography can be dogmatics by other means. Mining diaries and correspondence, he narrates Bavinck’s life as a unified vocation ordered to **churchly dogmatics**, **pastoral ministry**, and civic **statesmanship**. The book resists hagiography while dismantling the **two Bavincks** stereotype, showing how Bavinck’s student years among **Dutch Modernists**, his marriage and pastoral concerns, and his participation in the **Anti-Revolutionary Party** all cohere with his confessional **Reformed** commitments. Eglinton illumines the delicate balance of **catholicity** and **antithesis** in Bavinck’s posture: a generous openness to the sciences and arts that remains principled by Scripture as the **principium cognoscendi** and by God’s triune being as the **principium essendi**. He shows that Bavinck’s unity is not existential stubbornness but a theological achievement grounded in **Trinitarian ontology**, enabling a Reformed presence in modern universities, parliaments, and pulpits. As such, the biography also becomes a proposal for **public theology** that is not an annex to dogmatics but its proper outworking.

#### 4. Translation and reception: crafting the canon
Eglinton has deliberately shaped the Anglophone canon of **Neo-Calvinism** through translation and editorial interventions. His co-translation of **Herman Bavinck: Christian Worldview** (2019) reframes the much-debated category of **worldview** as an act of confessional and doxological reason rather than a totalizing ideology. Here **worldview** is an organic construction responsive to **revelation**, tied to **creation-fall-redemption** and regulated by the **analogia fidei** within the church’s reading of Scripture. As editor of **Herman Bavinck on Preaching and Preachers** (2017), he foregrounds the homiletical telos of dogmatics, undercutting tendencies to isolate **Kuyperian** cultural theory from the ordinary means of grace. The point is to repair the link between **dogmatics**, **exegesis**, and **preaching**, where the organic bond of truth and life is nourished within the **church**. These projects correct distortive receptions that either subordinate theology to cultural labor or reduce **Reformed catholicity** to a tribal identity. Translation thus becomes theological curation, bringing forward texts that display the integration of **Trinitarian dogma**, **ethics**, and **public vocation**.

#### 5. Neo-Calvinism clarified: the 2023 theological introduction
With **Cory Brock** and **N. Gray Sutanto**, Eglinton co-authored **Neo-Calvinism: A Theological Introduction** (2023), which distills the movement’s dogmatic architecture. The book recovers the **principia** of theology as Bavinck understood them, rehearses the **archetypal-ectypal** distinction, and clarifies the central slogan **grace restores nature** against both **nature-grace conflation** and stark **nature-grace dualism**. Emphasis falls on **common grace** and **antithesis** as correlative truths, not competitors: common grace grounds civic life and learning, while antithesis names the noetic and moral rupture wrought by sin. A robust teaching of **sphere sovereignty** and **creational ordinances** is tethered to a non-competitive **divine concurrence** anchored in **divine simplicity** and **providence**. The book delineates what **Neo-Calvinism** is not: neither a theonomic reduction nor a baptizing of modern secular projects. Instead, it promotes a **Reformed catholic** picture of Christian scholarship and social life governed by **Trinitarian** and **covenantal** grammar. Eglinton’s hand is evident in the insistence that doctrinal first principles regulate cultural participation.

#### 6. Dogmatic centers: Trinity, revelation, and analogy
At the doctrinal core of Eglinton’s retrieval are claims about **Trinitarian ontology**, **revelation**, and **analogy**. He reads Bavinck’s doctrine of God as classical and catholic: **divine simplicity**, **immutability**, and **aseity** coordinated with the living fullness of the **triune relations**. The **archetype-ectype** distinction, drawn from Reformed scholasticism, safeguards **Creator-creature distinction** while grounding a true yet analogical knowledge of God. This secures both the **analogia fidei** and a chastened account of the **analogia entis** as a creaturely participation by grace, resisting equivocity without collapsing into univocity. Eglinton’s account of **revelation** emphasizes organic wholeness: general and special revelation are distinct yet united under one **self-communicating God**, with Scripture as the norming **principium cognoscendi** and Christ as the center. The result is a retrieval of **theological epistemology** that can underwrite Christian philosophy and the sciences without ceding the rule of **dogmatics**. His work thus reconstructs a Reformed metaphysic of participation that is rigorously confessional and non-speculative, ordered to **exegesis** and **preaching**.

#### 7. Church, academy, and public theology
Eglinton’s constructive horizon reaches beyond academic dogmatics to **public theology**. He insists that the church’s ordinary life funds its cultural mission: preaching, sacraments, and catechesis cultivate a **worldview** and habitus capable of scholarly and civic vocations. The **common grace** that sustains political order and scientific discovery becomes intelligible within an **organic** account of creation’s integrity, while **antithesis** names the unavoidable conflict over ultimate loyalties. Here **sphere sovereignty** disciplines the temptation of ecclesial or state overreach by respecting creational difference and the lordship of Christ over every square inch. Yet the grammar is decidedly **Trinitarian** and **covenantal**, resisting both secular neutrality and confessional overreach. In this way, Eglinton positions **Neo-Calvinism** as a chastened but confident **Reformed catholicity**, open to dialogue with **Roman Catholic ressourcement** and wary of **Barthian** revisions that displace nature by grace. Public theology becomes the enacted fruit of dogmatic truth, rather than a detached applied ethics.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: Barth, Kuyper, and modernity
Eglinton’s work triangulates **Herman Bavinck**, **Abraham Kuyper**, and **Karl Barth**. Against readings that treat Bavinck as a proto-**Barthian**, he argues that Bavinck’s classical doctrine of God and **analogy** preclude dialectical dissolutions of nature by grace. Yet he registers the Barthian challenge to **natural theology** by retrieving Bavinck’s strict regulation of all knowledge by **revelation** and the **Word of God**. With respect to **Kuyper**, Eglinton differentiates a catholic Neo-Calvinism from later ideological spins, stressing that **worldview** without **dogmatics** leads to cultural activism detached from ecclesial life. On modernity, he rejects nostalgic confessionalism and immanentist accommodation alike, portraying Bavinck as an **orthodox yet modern** theologian whose catholicity allows both retrieval and reform. Interactions with **Roman Catholic** metaphysics attend to **participation** and **simplicity** without ceding the **Reformed** account of Scripture’s primacy and the **archetypal-ectypal** grammar. In English-language debates, Eglinton thus positions Neo-Calvinism as a robustly classical alternative to thin **liberal Protestant** strategies and to purely **presuppositional** in-house polemics.

#### 9. Theological style: integration without collapse
A hallmark of Eglinton’s theological style is integration without collapse. The **organic motif** organizes doctrine and life around the **Trinity**, while the **Creator-creature** boundary is guarded by scholastic distinctions. The polarity of **common grace** and **antithesis** is held as a productive tension, not a zero-sum contest. **Sphere sovereignty** is integrated with **providence** and **vocation**, not weaponized as culture war. The result is a grammar of participation disciplined by **divine simplicity** and Scripture’s **sufficiency**. This style is also pedagogical and pastoral: the editorial volume on **preaching** displays a theologian concerned that dogmatics reach the pulpit and shape the people of God. The biography displays prudence in historical judgment, refusing to resolve mystery by psychoanalysis while allowing **archival** textures to correct thesis-driven narratives. Eglinton’s work thereby models a **Reformed catholic** imagination that is alert to modern challenges yet anchored in **confessional orthodoxy**.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation
From a confessional **Reformed** and Westminster-oriented vantage, Eglinton’s retrieval is a salutary re-centering of **Trinitarian dogmatics**, **archetype-ectype** distinctions, and Scripture as **principium cognoscendi**. His demolition of the **two Bavincks** thesis and his insistence that **worldview** be normed by **dogmatics** address enduring temptations within Neo-Calvinist reception. Yet tensions remain. First, the **organic motif** requires vigilant catechesis to prevent metaphysical holism from softening the **Creator-creature** distinction or obscuring the asymmetry of **grace**. Second, the correlation of **common grace** and **antithesis** can, in practice, drift toward civilizational optimism; a Westminster stress on **noetic depravity**, **covenantal antithesis**, and the primacy of the **means of grace** safeguards against over-realized cultural programs. Third, the account of **public theology** and **sphere sovereignty** invites dialog with two-kingdom exegesis of Christ’s kingship to maintain clarity on church polity and mission. Within classical **Reformed orthodoxy**, these cautions are internal calibrations rather than repudiations: Eglinton’s project can be strengthened by a Van Tilian emphasis on the principial contrast in **revelation** and by a stricter accent on **divine simplicity** and the ministry of the Word as the church’s distinctive contribution to the common good.
