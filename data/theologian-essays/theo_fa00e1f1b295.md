### ESSAY
Richard Rice emerges in late twentieth-century debates as a leading voice for **open theism**, a reframing of **providence** and **omniscience** within an evangelical, and specifically **Seventh-day Adventist**, horizon. Educated in American universities and long affiliated with **Loma Linda University**, Rice worked at the intersection of **biblical theology**, **analytic philosophy of religion**, and **pastoral theology**. His Adventist inheritance of the **Great Controversy** motif supplied a narrative backdrop where creaturely **freedom**, cosmic **conflict**, and divine **self-limitation** interpret Scripture's portrayal of a living God. Against the metaphysical apparatus of **classical theism** from **Augustine** through **Aquinas** and **Calvin**, he contended that the biblical God is temporally engaged, emotionally invested, and genuinely interactive, so that **immutability** and **impassibility**, if construed as nonresponsive, distort the priority of divine **love**.

Rice's early programmatic text, **The Openness of God: The Relationship of Divine Foreknowledge and Human Free Will** in 1980, introduced the thesis of **dynamic omniscience**: God knows all that can be known, yet future free choices, being not yet actual, are not objects of knowledge as definite truths. In 1985 this position was restated for a broader evangelical audience in **God's Foreknowledge and Man's Free Will**, emphasizing that exhaustive definite foreknowledge undercuts **libertarian freedom** and renders divine commands and warnings morally otiose. The controversy within Adventist publishing over the 1980 book signaled the larger evangelical fault line where the metaphysical priorities of **sovereignty** and **foreordination** collided with the moral priority of **love** and **risk**. Rice consistently argued that Scripture's narrative pattern of divine **repentance**, **petition**, and **contingency** is not merely anthropomorphic but revelatory of a **relational theism** in which God genuinely adjusts to creaturely histories.

The multi-author volume **The Openness of God** in 1994 cemented the movement's identity, pairing Rice with **Clark Pinnock**, **William Hasker**, **David Basinger**, and **John Sanders**. Within that collaborative work, Rice advanced the biblical and theological case that the God of Abraham, Moses, and Jesus is a God who makes **covenants**, responds to **prayer**, and enters genuine **dialogue**. Open theism, in his presentation, stood between **classical theism** and **process theology**, affirming **creatio ex nihilo**, sovereign capacity, and eschatological victory, while rejecting an atemporal, impassible, and exhaustively foreknowing deity. Rice pressed the distinction that whereas **process theism** posits metaphysical divine limitation, open theism posits **voluntary self-limitation** by divine **love**, thereby protecting the gratuity of creation and the trustworthiness of **providence** as responsive rather than coercive.

In Rice's broader dogmatic work, **The Reign of God** in its 1997 revised edition, the center of gravity shifts from the locus of **theology proper** to the biblical theme of **kingdom**. The doctrine of God is construed in sovereign yet relational terms, and the sweep of **creation**, **fall**, **redemption**, and **consummation** is narratively rendered under the reign of a God whose **agape** governs every locus. This Adventist systematic re-situates traditional distinctives such as the **Sabbath**, the **sanctuary** motif, and **conditional immortality** within the larger framework of **kingdom ethics** and historical **apocalyptic**, but theologically the unique mark is a sustained refusal to abstract divine **attributes** from the lived drama of **covenant**. Thus the grammar of **kensosis** and **self-giving love** functions not as a Christological exception but as the comprehensive idiom of divine action in history.

The constructive heart of Rice's proposal consists in his account of **omniscience**, **providence**, and **prayer**. On **omniscience**, he rejects **Boethian** timeless knowledge and **Molinist middle knowledge** on the grounds that both reintroduce determinacy into the domain of future contingents. The metaphysical worry is the so-called grounding objection: there are no truthmakers for counterfactuals of libertarian freedom, so **middle knowledge** either collapses into determinism or becomes gratuitous. On **providence**, Rice advances a model of **responsive sovereignty** in which God sets broad purposes and binds himself by **covenant**, yet leaves the tract of history partly open, embracing **risk** for the sake of meaningful relationship. On **prayer**, he insists on dialogical efficacy, where petition becomes a real factor in divine deliberation because **God's will** is not exhaustively fixed atemporally but enacted temporally with creaturely participation.

Rice's theodicy refracts his open theism through the Adventist **Great Controversy** lens. In **Suffering and the Search for Meaning** in 2014, he surveys classical, free-will, soul-making, protest, and process responses, but returns to a distinctive synthesis: evil is parasitic upon created goods and sustained by creaturely **freedom**, but God has chosen a path of **cruciform** patience in which present nonintervention often serves long-range **kingdom** purposes. Divine **passibility** functions as a positive attribute, grounding *compassio* and solidarity. Yet Rice does not encumber providence with incapacity; he holds that God can and does intervene, but by wise love rather than by constant override. The cosmic **conflict** motif secures both the gravity of evil and the moral intelligibility of a God who consents to be affected by the world he loves.

Christologically, Rice locates **incarnation** as the decisive revelation of **divine love** and **openness**, wherein the Son's **kenosis** discloses the character of God as self-giving. He reads the atonement less as satisfaction of a timeless **decretum** and more as the climactic embodiment of **covenant fidelity**, emphasizing themes of **victory** over the powers and **reconciliation** through love. Soteriology follows suit: **justification** and **sanctification** are relational participations in the **kingdom**, dependent on human response made possible by prevenient grace, with **perseverance** framed dynamically rather than as an infallible decree. Eschatology remains robust and Adventist, with the consummation interpreted as the definitive vindication of divine **love** and the closure of the **conflict** with evil, not as the mere outworking of a timeless blueprint.

Methodologically, Rice's stance is self-consciously **biblicist** in the best sense, foregrounding canonically patterned **narrative** and the phenomenology of the biblical God. He criticizes speculative **metaphysics** that privilege **simplicity**, **pure actuality**, and timeless **immutability** over the exegetical witness to divine **repentance**, **lament**, and **petition**. Yet he is not anti-metaphysical; his uptake of **analytic** tools allows him to specify distinctions about **modal reality**, **future tense truths**, and **counterfactuals**. His polemic against **classical theism** thus functions not as a denial that God is perfect, but as a claim that perfection is indexed by **love** rather than by immobility. The guiding hermeneutic is that biblical depictions of divine interaction are substantially true, so that the burden of proof lies with any philosophical gloss that would reduce them to merely **anthropopathic** accommodations.

Rice's relation to **process theology** is carefully delineated. He welcomes its emphasis on **relationality**, divine **persuasion**, and the moral priority of **love**, but rejects its denial of **creatio ex nihilo**, its metaphysical divine-world coequality, and the necessary limitation of God's **power**. Against process panentheism, Rice maintains transcendent sovereignty, though refracted through **self-limitation** for the sake of **freedom**. In dialogue with **Molinism**, he presses the grounding objection and urges that **middle knowledge** is an unnecessary duplication that does not preserve the openness requisite for libertarian responsibility. With **Augustine** and **Calvin**, he finds a common concern for divine glory but disputes that glory is best displayed by exhaustive **predestination** and immutably fixed decree. The upshot is a reconfiguration of the divine perfections around **love**, yielding what Rice and colleagues call **open and relational theology**.

Ecclesiologically and pastorally, Rice develops a theology of **belonging** and **community** consistent with relational theism. In works addressed to church life, he prioritizes **discipleship**, **worship**, and **mission** as dialogical engagements where **prayer** and responsive obedience are not ornament but essence. The church participates in the **kingdom** as a fellowship of co-laborers whose genuine agency matters to God. This pastoral inflection is not incidental. It underwrites his broader claim that doctrines of **foreknowledge**, **providence**, and **prayer** must vindicate the lived reality of petitionary practice, moral struggle, and suffering hope. The God who risks is also the God who calls and waits, whose **patience** is not weakness but the majestic restraint of sovereign **agape**.

From a Reformed or WTS vantage, Rice's proposal provokes fruitful yet fundamental disagreement about **revelation**, **providence**, and divine **attributes**. Reformed orthodoxy, grounded in **Scripture** and confessed in the **Westminster Standards**, affirms exhaustive definite **foreknowledge** and an eternal **decree** compatible with real secondary causes, employing **concursus** and a compatibilist account of **freedom**. The classical teaching on **simplicity**, **aseity**, qualified **impassibility**, and **immutability** is not a denial of divine **love**, but the ontological grammar enabling God's faithful **covenant** pathos in history. Anthropomorphic depictions are true yet analogical, governed by the Creator-creature **analogia fidei** and the accommodated mode of biblical speech. Where Rice reads the biblical give-and-take as strict mutuality requiring ontic **openness**, a Reformed alternative reads it as covenantal **condescension** wherein God freely orders real means and contingencies within a comprehensive providence. The Reformed doctrine of **prayer** as ordained means preserves genuine efficacy without positing divine ignorance of future contingents. Finally, the **Great Controversy** motif, while pastorally potent, risks subordinating the divine **decretum** to historical contest. A classical Reformed reply would commend a cruciform providence in which the same triune **love** Rice exalts is secured precisely by God's simple, immutable, and wise decree revealed in **Christ**, the mediator of the covenant, rather than by redefining **omniscience** or **sovereignty**.
