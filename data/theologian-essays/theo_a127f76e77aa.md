### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Egbert **Schuurman** emerged from the postwar Netherlands where reconstruction, rapid industrialization, and Agrarian modernization created a pervasive **technocratic ethos**. Born in 1937 and trained within the Dutch **engineering-university milieu**, he took up chairs in Christian philosophy at technological hubs such as **Eindhoven**, **Delft**, and **Wageningen**, sites that epitomized the modern **technological world-picture**. His intellectual formation was decisively shaped by **Abraham Kuyper** and the **Reformational philosophy** of **Herman Dooyeweerd** and **D. H. Th. Vollenhoven**, whose categories of **religious ground motives**, **sphere sovereignty**, and **modal aspects** offered an alternative to both **Enlightenment instrumentalism** and **romantic anti-modernism**. The setting is crucial: Schuurman worked not from a detached humanities perch but within the laboratories and policy debates of the **technological university**, which pressed his philosophy toward a concrete **ethics of responsibility** rather than a merely speculative critique.

At the center of Schuurman’s method stands a Dooyeweerdian **transcendental critique** that asks what **religious ground motive** animates modern **technicism**. He uses the Reformational schema of **structure and direction** to differentiate the creational **structure** of technology as a good, norm-governed cultural possibility from its sinful **direction** when driven by the **nature-freedom ground motive** of the Enlightenment. The modal-aspect ontology maps reality’s irreducible **aspects** from the **numeric** to the **pistical** and insists that technological practice must heed the **normativity** proper to each. The **sphere sovereignty** of diverse societal structures forbids the empire-building of a technical or state sphere over economics, law, family, church, or science. This methodological ensemble frames a multi-level critique of the **autonomy of technology**, a diagnosis of **idolatry of progress**, and a positive program for **normative design**.

#### 2. Early diagnosis: the technological world-picture and responsibility
Schuurman’s early signature essay, **The Technological World Picture and an Ethics of Responsibility** (1972), introduced his core claim: modernity is dominated by a **world-picture** in which all entities become raw material for **control**, and humans become functionaries within systems optimized by **instrumental rationality**. Here Schuurman joins **Max Weber** on **rationalization** and **Jürgen Habermas** on **instrumental reason**, while critically engaging **Martin Heidegger’s** analysis of **Gestell** or enframing. Unlike Heidegger’s quasi-fateful diagnosis that leaves ethics thin, Schuurman installs a robust **normative ethics of responsibility** grounded in **creation order**. He appropriates **Hans Jonas’s** language of responsibility yet shifts its metaphysical base from a future-oriented imperative to **creational givens** that disclose enduring **structural norms** across the modal **aspects**.

The argument cuts a path between **Jacques Ellul’s** cultural pessimism and secular technological triumphalism. Against Ellul, Schuurman refuses a totalizing autonomy of **la technique** by insisting on the **heart’s religious direction** as the true driver of culture. Against the triumphalists, he denies that technical possibility supplies moral permission. The early work already displays the Reformational grammar of **creation, fall, redemption** and the **cultural mandate** of Genesis 1 as a charter for technology as obedient cultivation under **creational norms**. Responsibility is thus not merely prudential but covenantal: to design is to answer to the **Creator’s law-word** that pervades all aspects of reality.

#### 3. Consolidation: faith and hope beyond technicism
In **Faith and Hope in Technology** (1994 Dutch; English 2003), Schuurman gathered his university lectures and public addresses into a panoramic critique of **technicism** and a constructive Christian vision. The work analyzes the **idolatry of progress** as a **religious ground motive** that displaces **faith in God** with trust in **autonomous technique**. The analysis ranges over computing, energy, transport, agriculture, and biomedicine, showing how technical success can harden into **reductionism** when the **formative aspect** is absolutized at the expense of the **economic**, **aesthetic**, **juridical**, and **ethical** aspects. The book’s rhetoric of **faith and hope** is deliberate: it refuses both fear and naive optimism. Faith acknowledges the **goodness of creation** and the legitimacy of skilled making under God’s law, while hope resists despair by situating technology within an **eschatological horizon** not of human manufacture but of **new creation** by Christ.

Within this constructive frame, Schuurman deploys Dooyeweerd’s **multi-aspect normativity** to outline **design norms**. For example, a transport system aimed at mere speed may violate the **social**, **aesthetic**, and **juridical** norms for community, beauty, and justice. A biotechnology project that optimizes yield while degrading **biotic integrity** and **stewardship** fails the **biotic** and **ethical** aspects. The modal aspects here function as a set of **irreducible normative checks** against the domination of a single metric such as efficiency. The result is a sophisticated **ethics of limits**, not Luddite but **creationally bounded**, valorizing appropriate scale, **subsidiarity**, and **rest** as modes of obedience that resist technocratic overreach.

#### 4. Philosophical challenge: technology ordered to creation
The later synthesis **Technology and the Future: A Philosophical Challenge** (2009) distills decades of reflection into an explicit **philosophy of technology**. Schuurman reframes the question of the future by asking which **ground motive** will orient technological development. He contrasts the **humanist nature-freedom dialectic** with the **biblical creation-fall-redemption** motive, arguing that only the latter can grant a future that is genuinely **gift** and not merely **project**. Technology becomes a **cultural calling** under **creational norms**, not a surrogate eschatology. The book sharpens his critique of the **autonomy of technology** myth by analyzing **path dependence** and systemic lock-in, yet again resists Ellulian fatalism by emphasizing the **religious heart** as the steering center of cultural direction.

This work also elaborates Schuurman’s hallmark distinctions of **structure and direction**. The structural side affirms technology as a good creational possibility, rooted in the **formative aspect** of human making. The directional side assesses whether technological practice is guided toward **shalom** or bent toward **idolatry**. Here Schuurman wields **sphere sovereignty** to argue that the state must not collapse into technocracy, the market must not be sacralized as a technical optimizer, and science must respect the autonomy and internal norms of other **spheres** such as family, church, and art. The vision is simultaneously **anti-reductionist** and **institutionally pluralist**, a platform for **public theology** that does not surrender to procedural neutrality.

#### 5. Interlocutors and differentiations within the philosophy of technology
Schuurman’s interlocutors reveal both convergence and principled divergence. With **Heidegger**, he sees that modern technology frames beings as **standing-reserve**, but he refuses Heidegger’s nebulous **Gelassenheit** as ethically insufficient and religiously indeterminate, proposing instead an **ethics of obedience** to **creation order**. With **Ellul**, he shares suspicion of the **autonomy thesis** yet counters that the **antithesis** between belief and unbelief, not an impersonal technique, determines the cultural direction of technology. With **Hans Jonas**, he applauds the **principle of responsibility** but relocates responsibility within **creational norms** rather than fear-driven futurity. Against **Max Weber** and **Habermas**, Schuurman accepts the diagnosis of **instrumental rationality** but adds a thick **normative pluralism** that cannot be retrieved by discourse ethics alone. Later, with **Albert Borgmann’s** analysis of the **device paradigm**, he agrees that commodified devices hollow practices, yet he ground his corrective not in neo-Aristotelian practice theory alone but in **sphere sovereignty** and **multi-aspect normativity**.

These differentiations clarify his method. Whereas many philosophies of technology trade in descriptive phenomenology or procedural democratic ethics, Schuurman insists that any adequate account must be **religiously confessional** at the level of ultimate commitments. The guiding contrast is between the modern **nature-freedom** dialectic and the biblical **creation-fall-redemption** ground motive. The former oscillates between determinism and voluntarism, feeding both technological necessity and promethean mastery. The latter honors **creational law**, acknowledges **sin’s perversion** of direction, and opens **redemptive reorientation** by the **Spirit** toward norms that lead to **justice** and **beauty** in technological life.

#### 6. Domains of application: agriculture, biomedicine, environment, and digital culture
Because Schuurman taught at **Wageningen** and engaged parliamentary committees, his applied analyses carry institutional weight. In **agriculture**, he contends that industrialized monoculture violates the **biotic** and **economic** aspects by exhausting soils and narrowing resilience, and it offends the **aesthetic** and **ethical** aspects by commodifying creatures. In **biotechnology**, he warns against **technicism** that treats genomes as mere code, calling for **juridical** norms to protect dignity and ecological integrity and **ethical** norms against commodification of life. In **environmental ethics**, he deploys the **creational order** as an ontological basis for **stewardship**, offering an alternative to both anthropocentric exploitation and sacralized nature. In **digital culture**, he sees how ubiquitous connectivity intensifies **instrumental rationality**, urging designs that embed **social**, **aesthetic**, and **juridical** goods, such as privacy by design and humane attention architectures.

Each domain exemplifies the practical force of **multi-aspect normativity**. Design teams must map projects against the full range of modal aspects and articulate tradeoffs as normative tensions, not merely efficiency optimizations. Policy must respect **sphere sovereignty**, avoiding blunt technocratic regulation that crushes mediating institutions. Education must form engineers in **ethical imagination** attuned to **creation order**, equipping them to resist the career incentives that reward single-metric success. The overarching claim is that technology is always already **moral** and **religious**, since it is directed by the **heart**, either toward **idols** of power and control or toward **service** of God and neighbor.

#### 7. Political vocation and public theology
Schuurman’s parliamentary service in the Dutch Senate with the **Reformed Political League** and later the **ChristianUnion** extended his philosophy into **public theology**. He argued in speeches and committee work that **law** should be attuned to **creational norms**, defending human dignity in **biomedicine**, prudence in **energy policy**, and **juridical** limits on surveillance technologies. His legislative posture exemplified **sphere sovereignty**: protect the **juridical sphere** from capture by **technical systems**, preserve the **family and education** spheres from marketized datafication, and maintain a free **scientific sphere** accountable to internal norms and public justice. He advanced a Reformed vision of **plural public reason** in which communities speak from their confessional convictions while seeking the **common good** under the **juridical** aspect of justice.

This public vocation also sharpened his attention to **institutional design**. Against the naive assumption that more expertise solves policy problems, Schuurman advocated structures that embed **accountability**, **transparency**, and **subsidiarity**. He thus translated **creational norms** into legal and procedural frameworks, an extension of his normative design thesis from artifacts to institutions. The underlying axiom remains constant: **technocracy** is not neutral expertise but a **religiously charged** direction of culture that must be redirected by acknowledgment of **God’s sovereignty** and **human stewardship**.

#### 8. Theological grammar: creation, fall, redemption, and eschatology
The theological grammar driving Schuurman’s project is unambiguously Reformed. He begins with **creation** as good and ordered, perceivable through **general revelation** in creational **law-structures** that give technology its potential. He treats **fall** as a noetic and cultural disorder of the **heart** that bends technology’s direction toward **idolatry of progress** and domination. He articulates **redemption** as Christ’s renewing power by the **Spirit** that reorients cultural labor toward **obedience** and **service** under **creational norms**. Finally, he situates all cultural work within **eschatological hope**, denying both secular utopia and cultural despair. Technology can be a penultimate good that anticipates **shalom**, yet it never becomes soteriological. Hence, he rejects secular millenarianism and a sacralized **science-and-technology soteriology**, while also opposing retreatism that abandons the **cultural mandate**.

This grammar grounds Schuurman’s endorsement of **common grace** as the divine restraint and enabling of cultural life among believers and unbelievers, giving grounds for cooperation in design and policy. Yet he pairs common grace with **antithesis**, insisting that ultimate religious direction still divides projects. The **modal aspects** provide the ethical texture of obedience, but the **pistical aspect** of **faith** names the ultimate orientation of the heart. This blending of **Kuyperian** categories with **Dooyeweerd’s** ontology yields a theological ethics of technology that is both principled and practically fecund.

#### 9. Assessment, tensions, and Reformed or WTS evaluation
Egbert **Schuurman’s** achievement is to have forged a distinctively **Reformational philosophy of technology** that refuses both technological determinism and romantic reaction, grounding responsible design and policy in **creation order**, **multi-aspect normativity**, and **sphere sovereignty**. His major works from **1972**, **1994/2003**, and **2009** form a coherent arc that diagnoses **technicism**, constructs an ethics of **responsibility**, and articulates a civic vision for **plural** and **creationally bounded** technological cultures. His differentiations from **Heidegger**, **Ellul**, **Jonas**, and **Habermas** demonstrate both philosophical literacy and theological resolve. The public vocation in the **Dutch Senate** gave institutional concreteness to claims that might otherwise remain classroom theses.

From a classical Reformed and Westminster-oriented vantage, several strengths and tensions appear. Positively, Schuurman’s **antithesis** and denial of neutrality resonate with **Van Til’s** presuppositional insistence that all thought is covenantally situated, while his appeal to **general revelation** and **creational norms** fits the Reformed doctrine of **creation**. His critique of **technicism** as **idolatry** accords with **Romans 1**, and his call for **sphere sovereignty** strengthens a Protestant account of institutional limits and the **juridical** common good. Two cautions arise. First, the Dooyeweerdian **modal-aspect ontology** can function as a near-total architectonic that risks eclipsing the primacy of **special revelation** and the **covenant of grace** in moral reasoning, and it can appear to under-specify **Christology** and ecclesial practices as the concrete matrix of cultural sanctification. A Westminster alternative would recalibrate the order: Scripture norming all creational theory, **law-gospel** clarifying the role of norms, and **union with Christ** supplying the deepest engine of cultural transformation. Second, the heavy reliance on **creational norms** may drift toward a quasi-**natural law** without the thick covenantal specification of **Sabbath**, **jubilee**, and the **Decalogue** as interpretive anchors. A WTS-shaped refinement would weight the **covenant** more explicitly, weaving **redemption** through design judgments and disciplining normative pluralism by **redemptive-historical** categories. With these calibrations, Schuurman’s constructive core remains a powerful Reformed resource for resisting **technocracy** and advancing **responsible technology** in hope of the **new creation**.
