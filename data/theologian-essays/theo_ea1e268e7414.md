### ESSAY
Bruce Riley Ashford emerges as a contemporary voice in **evangelical public theology** who labors to reunite doctrine, mission, and culture under the **cosmic lordship of Christ**. Formed within the **Southern Baptist** tradition, he taught at Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary across the first two decades of the twenty-first century, serving as professor of **theology and culture** and as a senior academic leader during years of intensifying **secularization** and partisan polarization in the United States. His pastoral and teaching vocation moved along missional tracks, influenced by cross-cultural experience and the strategic turn to **missional ecclesiology** after 2000. The social setting was marked by the collapse of evangelical cultural privilege, post-Christian urbanization, and the spread of **digital media**, which together sharpened questions about **religious liberty**, civic presence, and discipleship in the late modern West. Within that context, Ashford crafted a distinctly **neo-Kuyperian** program that reappropriated **Abraham Kuyper's** famous square-inch dictum for contemporary discipleship.

Methodologically, Ashford advances a **revelational epistemology** that refuses Enlightenment claims to **neutral reason** and instead foregrounds **presuppositions** and **heart posture** in all knowing. He retrieves the **antithesis** motif from **Kuyper** and **Cornelius Van Til**, insisting that regenerate and unregenerate persons live from rival ultimate commitments, yet he immediately places this within a comprehensive doctrine of **common grace** that enables shared labor and partial consensus in the civitas terrena. Epistemically, he is sympathetic to **Alvin Plantinga's** account of warranted Christian belief and appreciative of **Carl F. H. Henry's** insistence on **propositional revelation**, while organizing the whole by a **biblical-theological narrative** of **creation, fall, redemption, and consummation**. The canonical storyline functions as a **worldview** map, not to replace dogmatics but to situate the loci in a single plot in which **kingdom** and **mission** are integrative categories. The result is a method that is confessional and public, rejecting *lex neutralis* while affirming **principled pluralism** and **sphere sovereignty** as political-theological tools for a differentiated society.

At the conceptual center of Ashford's project stands the notion of **worldview** as life-system under **Christ's lordship**. In **Every Square Inch** from 2015 he offers an accessible yet programmatic account of Christian **cultural engagement** that combines **Augustine's** ordo amoris with **Kuyper's** cultural optimism tempered by **Bavinck's** realism about sin. The book unfolds how **creation** discloses creational norms for art, science, and politics, how the **fall** disorders cultural liturgies into **idolatry**, how **redemption** in Christ reorients vocation, and how the coming **consummation** relativizes every penultimate good. He emphasizes **vocation** beyond the clerical estate, he endorses **institutional differentiation** akin to **sphere sovereignty**, and he calls for **public persuasion** rather than coercion. The work is peppered with analysis of contemporary **ideologies** as counterfeit religions and borrows from **James K. A. Smith** on the formative power of **cultural liturgies**, urging evangelicals to inhabit counter-liturgies shaped by the **gospel**.

The companion volume **One Nation Under God** from 2015, coauthored with **Chris Pappalardo**, extends Ashford's **political theology** into the American context. There he articulates Baptist **free church** commitments to **religious liberty** and the separation of **church and state**, while rejecting the separation of **faith and politics**. The book argues for the state's divine vocation of **public justice**, the limits of governmental authority, and the primacy of **conscience**. Policy chapters address **sanctity of life**, **marriage and family**, **race**, **war and peace**, and **economic justice**, each treated within a framework of **creation order**, **moral law**, and the **image of God**. The tone is **prudential** rather than ideological, counsel for **persuasion** in a **pluralist** democracy rather than pursuit of theocracy or withdrawal into sectarian enclaves. The authors avoid **theonomy**, reject civil religion, and commend a chastened **Christian realism** that seeks incremental goods within the ambiguities of the saeculum.

Ashford's rhetorical experiment **Letters to an American Christian** from 2018 dramatizes the pedagogical thrust of his **public theology** by adopting the epistolary voice of a mentor to a younger believer navigating campus and civic life. The letters dissect **nationalism**, **progressivism**, **identity politics**, **libertarianism**, and **populism** as distinct forms of **idolatry**, each absolutizing a penultimate good. Drawing on **Augustine's** two cities and **Calvin's** factory of idols, Ashford urges a posture of principled **civility** and evangelical clarity, calling for **neighbor-love** and the refusal to baptize any party platform. The work displays his pastoral aim to catechize laypersons in **virtue**, **prudence**, and **discernment** without softening the **lordship of Christ** over political life.

Two volumes frame Ashford's missional instincts. The edited collection **Theology and Practice of Mission** from 2011 brings together essays that define **mission** as participation in God's triune work, while safeguarding the primacy of **gospel proclamation** and **church planting**. Here Ashford appropriates the language of *missio Dei* but resists the reduction of mission to broad cultural projects that marginalize **evangelism** and **discipleship**. The hybrid manual **I Am Going** from 2012, coauthored with **Daniel L. Akin**, translates missional theology into habits of everyday witness, connecting **Great Commission** obedience to vocational and civic settings. Across these texts he insists that **mission** is integrative, binding together **ecclesiology**, **ethics**, and **public engagement**, yet he also warns against a politicized gospel that confuses **penultimate** cultural goals with **ultimate** eschatological hope.

With **Heath A. Thomas**, Ashford coauthored **The Gospel of Our King** in 2019, which offers a thicker dogmatic underpinning for his **worldview** and **mission** emphases. The book defines the **gospel** as the royal announcement that Jesus is **king**, centers the **kingdom of God** in the canonical narrative, and then tracks implications for **doctrine**, **worship**, and **public life**. It leans on **biblical theology** to connect the **covenant** storyline from creation through Israel to Christ, situating **justification** and **sanctification** within a kingdom framework that energizes **vocation** and **justice** as fruits of union with Christ. Without diminishing forensic grace, the book elevates **eschatological** participation and **mission** as necessary modes of discipleship in a disenchanted world. The accent on **integrated discipleship** maintains Baptist distinctives in **ordinances**, **congregational polity**, and **religious liberty**, even as it appropriates **Kuyperian** structural insights.

Ashford's constructive proposals are animated by a sustained set of dialogues with modern and contemporary voices. From **Lesslie Newbigin** he receives a stringent analysis of modern **secular reason** as culturally embedded and a missional call to a fresh **public truth** of the gospel. From **Oliver O'Donovan** he takes a chastened account of **political authority** under Christ's rule, which keeps **authority** and **judgment** from dissolving into proceduralism. From **Alasdair MacIntyre** he inherits the grammar of **practices** and **traditioned rationality** that lift discourse beyond thin liberalism. From **Stanley Hauerwas** he critiques **Constantinianism** and learns to keep the **church** as a foretaste of the **eschatological polis**, though he resists an ecclesiocentrism that would mute **public persuasion**. From **Carl F. H. Henry** he draws confidence in **biblical inerrancy** and the cognitive content of revelation; from **Cornelius Van Til** he derives the rejection of **neutrality** and the call to **presuppositional** integrity in the public square. The synthetic effect is a Baptist-evangelical reception of **Reformational** public theology aimed at persuading a post-Christian culture.

Specific doctrinal moves clarify the shape of his thought. On **creation order**, Ashford affirms a real **natural law** inscribed in the world as *lex naturalis*, while refusing the fiction of religiously neutral **public reason**. On **anthropology**, he presents the **imago Dei** as royal and priestly vocation ordered to **worship**, so that culture is always liturgical and never merely technical. On **hamartiology**, he reads sin as **idolatry** and social as well as personal disorder, which explains the religious depth of political **ideologies**. On **Christology**, he stresses the **cosmic lordship of Christ** who reconciles all things, grounds the public character of **truth**, and relativizes every earthly regime. On **pneumatology**, he highlights the **Spirit's** work in empowering **mission**, nurturing **virtue**, and generating **church** as a distinctive public. On **eschatology**, he aligns with the **already-not-yet** of the **kingdom**, which prevents both **triumphalism** and **quietism** by naming cultural goods as real yet penultimate. The results cohere in a profile of **discipleship** that is ecclesially rooted, publicly present, and missionally oriented.

Ashford's work is marked by a sustained concern for **religious liberty**. Within a **Baptist** tradition of freedom of conscience, he grounds **liberty** in creational dignity as well as in the limits of civil jurisdiction under **God**. He argues that a liberal society at its best protects **institutional differentiation**, allowing churches, families, and schools to act without state usurpation. This is congruent with **sphere sovereignty**, translated into a free church idiom. He contends that such differentiation benefits neighbors across traditions, embodying **neighbor-love** and serving **public justice**. His advocacy for **pluralism** is not relativism because it is tethered to **truth** and to a principled account of the **state's** calling to secure public order rather than to enforce orthodoxy.

The tone of Ashford's program is pastoral and catechetical as well as scholarly. He seeks to train Christians for **vocational holiness** in law, medicine, education, arts, business, and politics, taking seriously **Kuyper's** claim that no square inch resists Christ's **sovereignty**. He underscores the centrality of **local church** formation, **preaching**, **sacraments** in Baptist understanding of ordinances, and **discipline** as the matrix of public faithfulness. He treats **civility** as a Christian virtue without surrendering **confessional clarity**, urging believers to argue without anger, to reason without rancor, and to persuade without panic. This posture aims to resist the **idolatry** of the moment while granting the **gospel** visibility in a crowded public square.

A Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation will register both substantial convergence and principled cautions. Westminster readers will commend Ashford's use of **Scripture as principium**, his **Van Tilian** rejection of **neutrality**, his retrieval of **antithesis**, and his disciplined use of **Kuyperian** tools like **sphere sovereignty** and **common grace** for **public theology**. They will also appreciate his insistence that **mission** is integrative yet that the **church** retains a distinctive calling, and his refusal to sacralize any modern **ideology**. Cautions will focus on calibration. First, some will judge that the invocation of **common grace** and **creational norms** risks inflating a **transformationalist** mandate that can eclipse the primacy of **Word and sacrament** and the church's pilgrim identity, where a more robust **Two Kingdoms** distinction might sharpen the difference between redemptive **special grace** and cultural **common grace**. Second, his occasional appeal to **natural law** and public **creation order** arguments could be pressed to display more explicit **covenant** grounding so that civil reasoning remains truly theonomic in the historic Reformed sense of **Scripture's sufficiency** rather than sliding toward a thin natural law register. Third, the **worldview** idiom, while pastorally potent, can function as a meta-theory that risks overshadowing classic **dogmatic loci** and might benefit from deeper anchoring in **classical theism**, **divine simplicity**, and a thicker **doctrine of providence**. Within those adjustments, Ashford's effort to form Christians for public faithfulness stands as a constructive, Kuyper-friendly contribution that Westminster readers can receive with gratitude and with principled refinement.
