### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, context, and method
Bruce Reichenbach belongs to the generation that rebuilt **philosophy of religion** after the collapse of **logical positivism**, drawing analytic tools to pose perennial theological questions about **God**, **causality**, **evil**, and **miracles**. Educated and teaching in the American Midwest, and long associated with Augsburg College in Minneapolis, he developed a distinctive voice that returned to **Aquinas** and **Leibniz** while engaging **Hume**, **Mackie**, and **Rowe** in the contemporary register of clarity and argument economy. The guiding vision is that sound **natural theology**, properly scaled, can clarify the rationality of theism without overreach. Reichenbach thus opts for a modest **evidentialism** and a cumulative case in which **cosmological reasoning**, **theodicy** via a robust **free will defense**, and a defense of **miracles** as credible divine acts jointly underwrite rational theistic commitment. He treats the **principle of sufficient reason** as a defeasible but powerful explanatory maxim, and he reads the regularity of nature as the stage on which **moral responsibility** and **divine action** can both play intelligible roles.

Reichenbach’s style is the measured argument of the analytic essay, not confessional polemic. He aligns methodological **moderation** with argumentative **precision**, often rehearsing options and formalizing distinctions before staking a position. His work is thus marked by careful taxonomy of **cosmological arguments** and by nuanced construals of **evil** and **miracle** that respect both logical structure and empirical constraints. The resulting posture is neither a sweeping rationalism nor a fideist retreat from public reason. It is instead what might be called a chastened **natural theology**, joined to an equally chastened account of **theodicy** in which lawlike creation, libertarian **free will**, and the goods of soul formation under **divine providence** interlock.

#### 2. Reassessing the cosmological argument
In **The Cosmological Argument: A Reassessment** from 1972 and in his later **Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy** article, Reichenbach offers a cartography of **cosmological reasoning** that differentiates the **Aquinas-type** causal series arguments, the **Leibnizian** appeal to **sufficient reason**, and the **kalam** argument popularized by **William Lane Craig**. He assesses the dependence of each variant on metaphysical auxiliaries such as the **impossibility of an actual infinite**, the structure of **essentially ordered causes**, and whether the **principle of sufficient reason** is synthetic a priori, empirical, or pragmatic. Reichenbach regards the cosmological family as a fertile set of abductive strategies, not as an apodeictic proof. He defuses common objections that confuse the **fallacy of composition** with legitimate inferential ascent from contingent wholes to a **necessary being**, and he distinguishes the denial of infinite past time from the denial of infinite **explanatory regress**, allowing that one can argue to a terminating explanation even if temporal infinity were granted.

Central to his reassessment is a defense of cosmological arguments as explanatory rather than deductive demonstrations. He reframes the **principle of sufficient reason** as a defeasible rule of rational inquiry: contingent reality stands in need of a grounding explanation that is not itself contingent on the same order, yielding a contrast between **contingency** and **necessity** that points to a metaphysically independent source. He is measured regarding **kalam**, noting that modern cosmology can lend suggestive support but cannot shoulder the entire inferential load. Where **Swinburne** uses Bayesian **confirmation**, Reichenbach prefers a more general abductive equilibrium, with theism offering a simple and unifying terminus for the **causal regress**. The upshot is a refunctionalization of classical moves into contemporary inquiry: the cosmological strategy is legitimate, but its force is probative rather than coercive, cumulative rather than singular.

#### 3. Evil and a good God: free will, laws of nature, and soul-making
Reichenbach’s long-standing work on **evil** culminates in **Evil and a Good God** in 1982, against the backdrop of **J. L. Mackie**’s logical problem and **William Rowe**’s evidential problem. He accepts **Alvin Plantinga**’s breakthrough that undercuts the logical contradiction by proposing transworld depravity and the compatibility of **libertarian freedom** with the possibility of evil. Yet Reichenbach presses further by articulating a combined **free will defense** and **natural law theodicy**. The moral architecture of the created order requires stable, discoverable **laws of nature** that bound the possibilities of action and consequence. Predictable regularities that permit responsible agency also permit the very harms that make agency morally weighty. Hence many evils are side-effects of the lawlike structures that underwrite **soul formation** and the development of virtues, echoing but also revising **John Hick**’s Irenaean **soul-making** thesis.

In this synthesis the goodness of God is not measured by the absence of pain but by the fittingness of an arena for **significant freedom** and **moral growth** within providential supervision. Reichenbach refuses both the stark Augustinian reduction of evil to pure privation and the more expansive process denial of **divine omnipotence**. He instead holds a robust **providence** in which God wills a lawlike creation precisely because stable structures are the necessary conditions for any morally meaningful world. The consequent framework avoids fatalism by rejecting **determinism**, and it respects the gravity of **gratuitous evil** by allowing that we often cannot see the full network of goods connected to specific sufferings within temporal horizons. Though not a theodicy by enumeration, his approach holds that the conjunction of free creatures, natural laws, and divine aims rationally defeats strong evidential claims that a **good God** is unlikely.

#### 4. Natural evil and the free will defense
The more pointed challenge to the **free will defense** arises from **natural evil**, a locus Reichenbach addressed in his 1976 International Journal for Philosophy of Religion article titled **Natural Evil and the Free Will Defense**. Critics such as **Rowe** argued that animal suffering, earthquakes, and disease cannot be traced to creaturely sin or choice. Reichenbach’s response is twofold. First, he insists that **natural law theodicy** is not a retreat but a principled position: the very conditions that allow embodied agents to act and learn entail fracturable bones, transmissible microbes, and tectonic plates, because a stable, exceptionless order is what renders interventions and precautions possible. Second, he opens space for an integrated view where **angelic** or superhuman creaturely freedom, or the long-term consequences of the kind of planet that nurtures rational life, ties so-called natural evils to the ecology of free agency without positing ad hoc exceptions.

This approach undercuts the **Humean** strategy of generalizing from horrendous instances to global improbability by insisting on a rich counterfactual structure: if God frequently suspended the **laws of nature**, the predictability required for moral action would collapse. It also engages **Rowe**’s evidential argument by shifting the debate to what counts as a justified expectation about the goods God might be pursuing, resisting claims of epistemic access to global optima. Reichenbach therefore reframes **natural evil** not as unrelated to freedom but as the inescapable shadow of a creation ordered for responsible agency. The conceptual hinge is the value of a regular world under **providence**, where the very metaphysical architecture that supports science and prudence stands also as the context in which divine redemption addresses suffering.

#### 5. Miracles, testimony, and the uniformity of nature
Reichenbach’s work on **miracles** enters a long debate with **David Hume** about uniform experience and the reliability of testimony. He argues that for a theist who already accepts **general providence**, a miracle is best defined as a specific act of **special divine agency** that is not a violation of a law but an event whose total cause includes an agent beyond the created causal nexus. Rather than pitting **miracles** against **laws of nature** as if they were competitive triggers, he models divine action as agent-causal input into an open system. This both rebuts a crude violation model and explains why miracles have a purposive, revelatory character within **salvation history**.

On the epistemic side, he restricts **Hume**’s maxim by clarifying that evidence for uniformity is inductive and defeasible. Strong testimonial networks, convergent independent reports, and background evidence for theism can together outweigh generic priors against rare events. Here Reichenbach is sympathetic to **Swinburne**’s use of **Bayesian** tools yet retains his own preference for cumulative abductive appraisal. Testimony is not magical but rationally assessable, and the possibility of **miracles** does not subvert science because science studies the regularities that define the baseline from which special divine acts are distinguishable. The heart of his case is a non-competitive model of **divine action**, where Creator and creation do not occupy the same causal slot, preserving both **lawlike regularity** and the occasional **sign** events that anchor religious tradition.

#### 6. Ethics, biology, and the imago Dei
In **On Behalf of God: A Christian Ethic for Biology** with the geneticist **V. Elving Anderson** in 1995, Reichenbach extends his concern for **lawlike order** into moral discernment about the life sciences. The same respect for **regularity** and the limits of control that animates his account of **evil** is here turned toward **genetics**, **reproductive technologies**, and **bioethics** under the canopy of the **imago Dei**. The book canvasses issues such as gene therapy, experimentation, and environmental stewardship, framing them not by utilitarian calculus alone but by a theistic account of **human dignity**, **stewardship**, and the goods of familial and communal life. The authors combine empirical sophistication with normative **natural law** sensibilities, arguing that the moral life must be navigated within the constraints of created givens as well as the promises of healing innovation.

At stake is an ethics of humility before the grain of creation that mirrors his theological appeal to **natural laws** in theodicy. They reject both a technological **prometheanism** that forgets finite wisdom and an anti-scientific suspicion that denies the good of healing. Instead they propose a virtue-oriented and rule-sensitive **Christian ethic**, attentive to **justice**, **beneficence**, and **nonmaleficence**, yet finally ordered by a theocentric vision of **agape**. The through-line is unmistakable: a world of stable laws is both the theater of responsible love and the arena where **divine providence** calls human agents to wise participation in the maintenance and repair of life.

#### 7. Coherence across domains: from metaphysics to practice
The impressive feature of Reichenbach’s corpus is its structural coherence across **metaphysics**, **epistemology**, **theodicy**, and **ethics**. His **cosmological argument** work insists that the line from **contingency** to **necessity** is an inference to the best explanation under the guide of the **principle of sufficient reason**. His **theodicy** maintains that the possibility of moral life depends on **regularity of nature**, which is itself the kind of order a wise God would create. His account of **miracles** posits that special acts of **divine agency** do not compete with that regularity but presuppose it as the contrast class. His **bioethics** situates moral deliberation within created limits that secure dignity and responsibility. The conceptual anchors are the pairings of law and liberty, agency and order, testimony and uniformity, creaturely freedom and **divine providence**.

This web of positions marks Reichenbach as a philosophical theologian who reformulates classical themes in contemporary voice. Unlike a purely **Reformed epistemology** strategy that grounds warrant in **properly basic** theistic belief, he labors to make **public reasons** available for the ultimacy of God, the rationality of trust in **miracles**, and the moral intelligibility of suffering under **providence**. Yet he does not claim demonstrative sufficiency; he is content with robust rational permissibility. That restraint is methodological and theological: a world ordered by God for responsible souls invites persuasion rather than compulsion, inquiry rather than irresistible proof.

#### 8. Interlocutors and debates: fittingness within a tradition
Reichenbach’s debates position him between **Plantinga**’s modal defense and **Swinburne**’s Bayesian theism, in extended exchange with **Mackie** and **Rowe** on **evil**, with **Hume** on **miracles**, and with **Craig** on **kalam**. He affirms **Plantinga**’s undercutting of the logical problem but thinks the story is incomplete without an account of **natural law theodicy**. He appreciates **Swinburne**’s probabilistic framework but avoids over-formalization where prior probabilities are inscrutable. He grants **Craig** that cosmology can support a beginning, yet prefers a **Leibnizian** tilt where the question of why there is something rather than nothing remains even if the universe is temporally infinite. With **Aquinas** he preserves the insight that essentially ordered causal series cannot regress infinitely if they are to explain present actuality, even while resisting strong metaphysical claims where analytic consensus is not available.

In response to **Hume**, he distinguishes the epistemic status of **uniform experience** from metaphysical **necessity**, arguing that testimony about **miracles** must be weighed, not dismissed by fiat. Against **Rowe**, he registers the limits of human epistemic access to the global balance of goods and evils, without making ignorance a reflexive shield. Across these conversations, the hallmark is a careful grammar of possibility, probability, and practical reason under **providence**, with an eye toward making theistic belief intellectually virtuous in the agora of secular philosophy. The guiding conviction is that theism unifies the domains many critics keep apart: the metaphysical demand for a **necessary being**, the moral need for a law-governed stage, and the historical claims of **revelatory** divine acts.

#### 9. Doctrinal threads: God, creation, providence, and human freedom
Doctrinally, Reichenbach presupposes a classical view of **God** as necessary, omnipotent, omniscient, and good, leading creator of a world ordered by **laws of nature** that are neither arbitrary nor mutable at whim. He upholds robust **human freedom** in a libertarian sense, resisting compatibilist strategies that would make evil a predetermined feature of the system. The doctrine of **providence** is strong yet non-deterministic, sustaining both ordinary conservation and occasional special action. Creation itself is teleologically configured for **soul formation**, an Irenaean accent that complements but does not replace the Augustinian emphasis on moral **culpability** and the privative character of evil. On epistemology, he remains committed to the public reasonability of theism through **natural theology**, while allowing that faith has its own doxastic dynamics that outstrip proof.

These doctrinal threads do not function as abstract axioms; they are operationalized in argument. The existence of a **necessary being** answers the metaphysical need for an ultimate ground. The coexistence of **free agents** and **laws** explains the landscape of moral significance and suffering. The action of **miracles** illuminates revelatory episodes within a generally stable order. And the practice of **bioethics** enacts reverence for the givenness of creation while harnessing science for compassionate ends. The unity of these threads gives his philosophical theology the feel of a single project: to show the fittingness of classical theism with the deepest structures of explanation, agency, and testimony.

#### 10. Reformed and WTS evaluation: revelation, reason, and covenant
From a **Reformed** and **WTS** vantage, Reichenbach’s achievement is a salutary rehabilitation of **natural theology**, **free will defense**, and a non-competitive account of **miracles**, yet several tensions surface regarding **revelation**, **covenant epistemology**, and **grace**. First, his modest **evidentialism** and appeal to a defeasible **principle of sufficient reason** can appear to grant autonomous reason too much neutrality, underestimating the **noetic effects of sin** and the antithesis articulated by **Van Til** between covenant obedience and autonomous rationality. A more covenantal **analogia fidei** would insist that knowledge of God is primarily from **Scripture** under the Spirit and only secondarily from creation, with **natural theology** functioning ministerially, not magisterially. Second, the reliance on **libertarian freedom** to solve the problem of evil risks displacing a classical Reformed account of **providence** and **compatibilist freedom** where divine sovereignty and human responsibility coinhere without indeterminism. The Reformed tradition would urge a thicker account of **federal headship**, **original sin**, and **redemptive history**, shifting theodicy from general goods to the **covenant of grace** and the cross, where God justifies the ungodly in Christ rather than by appeal to global balances of goods.

Third, while his account of **miracles** is salutary in rejecting violation language, a WTS critique would press for a stronger **redemptive-historical** location of signs as covenantal ratifications rather than primarily as credence builders within a general epistemology of testimony. Finally, his bioethical method resonates with **natural law** but would be strengthened by explicit **Reformed** loci such as **imago Dei** in covenant, the creational **Sabbath** pattern, and the eschatological horizon of **new creation**. In sum, the Reformed alternative affirms Reichenbach’s clarity and many conclusions, but it would subordinate **evidentialist** navigation to a principled **Scripture first** method, retrieve **compatibilist** freedom under meticulous **providence**, and locate the defeat of **evil** not chiefly in the goods of lawlike order and soul-making but in the history of **covenant redemption** that culminates in Christ.
