### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Mark A. Garcia emerged as a leading contemporary voice in the **Reformed** world by returning to **Calvin’s duplex gratia** and the **unio mystica** as the organizing center of salvation, a retrieval whose contours matured in the early twenty-first century amid disputes over **justification**, **imputation**, and **participation**. His work is located within the confessional Presbyterian sphere and the broader Reformed catholicity movement, with ministerial experience in the **PCA** and institutional leadership through the **Greystone Theological Institute** founded in 2015. The polemical backdrop includes the **New Perspective on Paul** and Federal Vision debates, as well as ecumenical discussions about **theosis** and **sacramental theology**. Methodologically he practices a disciplined ressourcement, reading **Calvin**, the **Reformed orthodox**, and **Scripture** with patient historical precision and systematic intent, shaped by the hermeneutical gains of **Vos** on the **historia salutis** and by **Gaffin** on the centrality of **union with the resurrected Christ**.

Garcia’s method unites historical theology and dogmatics with pastoral and liturgical sensibilities, so that **doctrine** returns to **preaching** and **sacramental practice** without loss of confessional clarity. He employs the classical distinction between *ad intra* and *ad extra*, affirms **divine simplicity** and **immutability**, and yet foregrounds **Christology** as the soteriological axis: the **totus Christus** theme, Spirit-wrought union with the **incarnate, crucified, risen Christ**, and the gifts that flow from him. Under this retrieval, **Calvin’s duplex gratia** is not a two-track system but a single grace in two inseparable modes, **justification and sanctification**, grounded in the one **union with Christ**. The research strategy is simple and demanding: read **Calvin’s 1559 Institutes**, the commentaries, sermons, and catechisms with attention to exegetical warrants, then follow the development through post-Reformation dogmatics to test coherence with **Westminster** categories like **imputation** and **covenant**.

#### 2. Life in Christ and the structure of salvation
Garcia’s signature contribution appears in **Life in Christ: Union with Christ and Twofold Grace in Calvin’s Theology** first published in 2008 and reissued in a revised form in 2019. The central thesis is that for **Calvin** the believer’s **union with Christ** is the theological fountain from which the **duplex gratia** of **justification** and **sanctification** necessarily and inseparably flow. Texts such as 1 Corinthians 1.30 are decisive: Christ himself is our **righteousness** and **sanctification**, so that these benefits are not parallel operations but distinct modalities of one participatory relation to the **Mediator**. Garcia emphasizes that **justification** retains an irreducibly **forensic** character, grounded in the **imputation** of **Christ’s obedience** and the **pardon of sins**, while **sanctification** is the Spirit’s renewing work, the vivificatio that conforms believers to Christ. Both are gifts of the same **Spirit-united** bond, thereby resisting a fragmentation of the **ordo salutis** into discrete, detachable blessings.

This integrative proposal corrects two opposite distortions. First, it resists a reduction of **Calvin** to a narrow **forensicism** that would abstract **justification** from the believer’s **participation** in Christ. Second, it guards against a participatory **theosis** idiom that would dilute **imputation** or turn **sanctification** into the ground of **acceptance with God**. Garcia shows that Calvin’s idiom of *unio mystica* maintains the distinction between Creator and creature, affirms the extra Calvinisticum, and locates participation in the economy of the **Spirit** rather than in an ontological fusion. The result is a carefully bounded **Reformed participation**: real sharing in Christ by the **Spirit**, expressed ecclesially in the **Word** and the **sacraments**, and ordered by **confessional** grammar.

#### 3. Ordo salutis, historia salutis, and the Spirit of the risen Christ
Flowing from this center, Garcia advances a recalibrated **ordo salutis** shaped by **historia salutis**. Influenced by **Vos** and **Gaffin**, he insists that union is with the **resurrected and exalted Christ**, so that the soteriological sequence is not a ladder of discrete stages but a multi-faceted communication of the one **Christ** to his people in the **Spirit**. **Justification** and **sanctification** are therefore simultaneous in union, distinguished by their respective relations to **law** and **life**, to **verdict** and **renewal**, yet coordinated as the double grace of the same **Christological** reality. The ordo is reframed as an ordered complex rather than a linear pipeline, which protects **assurance** by defeating the anxiety that sanctification must first rise to a threshold before justification can be trusted.

Garcia’s analysis also clarifies the status of **adoption**, **perseverance**, and **assurance** within the **duplex gratia** architecture. He treats **adoption** as a filial dimension of the same **union with the Son**, integrating it with **justification** so that the forensic decree secures the filial relation, while the Spirit of adoption powers the moral transformation named **sanctification**. **Perseverance** arises from the **covenant of grace** as administered by the **ascended Christ**, whose intercession guarantees the ongoing efficacy of the **Spirit** in the church. On **assurance**, Garcia follows the **Reformed** and **Puritan** mainstream in distinguishing the principial ground in **Christ’s righteousness imputed** from the secondary confirmations in **sanctification**, while urging a pastoral habit of directing consciences to **union with Christ** rather than to introspective inventory.

#### 4. Imputation, active obedience, and Westminster dogmatics
Against challenges to **imputation** and to the **active obedience** of Christ, Garcia defends the **Westminster Standards’** position that the righteousness of **Christ** is **accounted** to believers, including the positive obedience that fulfills the **law** as well as the satisfaction for sin. He notes that **Calvin** himself speaks of **imputation** and that later **Reformed orthodoxy** in **Turretin** and **Bavinck** consolidates this grammar. The claim is not a scholastic excrescence but a textual and theological entailment of union with the obedient **Second Adam**. Because union brings us into relation with the whole **Christ**, the law-fulfilling obedience of the **Mediator** is not merely exemplar but is graciously reckoned to us for **justification**. Here Garcia articulates a key contrast with both the **Finnish Luther** school and certain **New Perspective** trajectories, which construe righteousness as covenant membership without a robust **imputation** of obedience. For Garcia, **participation** in Christ never replaces **forensic** reckoning; rather, it presupposes and secures it.

In this line he also offers a constructive reading of **faith** as the **Spirit’s** uniting instrument, not a meritorious work, thereby aligning **union with Christ** with **sola fide**. Faith receives Christ entire. **Justification** and **sanctification** differ formally, yet both are benefits of faith-union. To protect the gratuitousness of grace, Garcia stresses the **covenant of grace** as the historical delivery of Christ’s benefits, while maintaining a law-gospel distinction at the level of justification that avoids antinomianism in sanctification. The **duplex gratia** therefore secures both the legal standing and the transformative reality of salvation.

#### 5. Participation and sacramental realism under Reformed constraints
Garcia pushes beyond abstract systematics by re-sourcing a **Reformed sacramental realism**. He follows **Calvin** in asserting a real communication of Christ in the **Lord’s Supper**, worked by the **Spirit**, without transubstantiation or local presence. This nourishes the **unio mystica** rather than creating it; the sacrament strengthens the bond forged by the **Word**. By rooting **participation** in the **Spirit’s** agency and the **ascended Christ**, Garcia avoids an ontological **theosis** and instead advocates a moral and filial participation marked by conformity to **Christ** and communion with the **Triune God**. The result is a catholic Reformed piety: a robust account of **means of grace** where **preaching** and **sacraments** are not mere signs but effectual signs by divine appointment.

In dialog with contemporary retrievals of **patristic** and **scholastic** sources, Garcia welcomes the language of participation while policing its metaphysical borders. The Creator-creature distinction is non-negotiable. The **extra Calvinisticum** secures the transcendence of the **Son** even in the incarnation, ensuring that union is mediated by the **Spirit** and covenantal promises rather than by any mixture of essences. Such constraints allow him to commend select insights from the **Greek fathers** and from medieval **Augustinian** trajectories, yet distinctively in a **Reformed** idiom that places **imputation** and **forensic justification** at the center of the gospel.

#### 6. Interlocutors and debates: Calvin, the New Perspective, and Reformed catholicity
Garcia’s conversation partners are both historical and contemporary. With **Calvin**, he argues against readings that separate **justification** as a self-standing forensic cause from **sanctification** as a second blessing, and he challenges modern reconstructions that minimize **imputation**. With **Bavinck**, he shares the instinct to hold together the juridical and the ethical within **union with Christ**, echoing the organic motif of grace restoring nature. From **Vos** and **Gaffin**, he draws the structural insight that the **resurrection** is soteriologically determinative, that **Pentecost** is the age of the **Spirit**, and that union is eschatological in shape. In dialogue with **N. T. Wright** and the **New Perspective**, Garcia appreciates the ecclesiological expansion of **justification** but rejects any construal that removes the believer’s **imputed righteousness** in favor of mere covenant badge.

Among contemporary Reformed theologians such as **Michael Horton**, **J. Todd Billings**, and **Robert Letham**, Garcia’s voice is distinctive for its double insistence that **union with Christ** is central and that **forensic justification** must remain non-negotiable and conceptually clear. Where some fear that union language relativizes justification, Garcia replies that Calvin’s **duplex gratia** does the opposite: it keeps justification close to Christ himself rather than floating in a merely legal ether. Where others worry that participation language smuggles in **theosis**, he restates the **Spirit’s** role and the covenantal economy as the safe terrain for talk of **communion with God**.

#### 7. Pastoral stakes: assurance, holiness, and preaching Christ
The practical burden of Garcia’s work is pastoral. If **union with Christ** is first, the conscience is ordered to look to **Christ** rather than to fluctuating degrees of **sanctification** for its peace. Assurance is therefore evangelical, grounded in the **imputation** of **Christ’s righteousness**, and enlivened by the Spirit’s sanctifying testimony in a life of gratitude. Preaching becomes explicitly **Christocentric**, heralding the crucified and risen Lord and summoning to faith as the instrument of union. The **Lord’s Supper** is catechetically reclaimed as a means by which the **Spirit** nourishes believers with **Christ**, promoting holiness that is genuinely evangelical, not moralistic.

This pastoral orientation also reframes spiritual warfare and ethics within the **duplex gratia**. The mortification of sin is not the procurement of favor but the outworking of life already secure in **Christ**. The vivification of obedience is a fruit of **adoption**, not a wage. In this setting, ecclesial discipline, catechesis, and the ordinary means become sites of **participation** in the risen Lord’s life. The payoff is the unity of the **ordo salutis** and **historia salutis** in the concrete rhythms of the congregation.

#### 8. Institutional and pedagogical contributions
Through the **Greystone Theological Institute** since 2015, Garcia has extended his project by cultivating trans-Atlantic conversations in **Reformed catholicity**, welcoming voices across confessional and academic lines while maintaining **Westminster** norms. Courses, colloquia, and publications emerging from this platform showcase his conviction that the **Reformed** tradition is at its best when deeply learned, ecclesially tethered, and pastorally aimed. The institute underscores educational habits congenial to Garcia’s work: textual immersion in **Calvin** and the **orthodox**, retrieval of **patristic** and **medieval** sources under **confessional** discipline, and an unapologetic embrace of **Word and sacrament** as the living matrix of theology.

The revised 2019 edition of **Life in Christ** signals his ongoing refinement of the thesis. The reissue presses the same central claims with expanded documentation and clarifications prompted by ensuing debates. It appears as part of a broader resurgence of **union with Christ** in evangelical and Reformed scholarship, where Garcia’s voice serves as a pivot joining **forensic** clarity with **participatory** depth. The sustained influence of the book is visible in seminary syllabi, church officer training, and clergy conferences where **Calvin’s duplex gratia** is now a common idiom.

#### 9. Doctrinal synthesis: Christ, covenant, and church
In sum, Garcia offers a doctrinal synthesis whose nerve center is **Christology** and whose grammar is **covenantal**. The **covenant of grace** is the instrument by which the **ascended Christ** gives himself to the church, through the **Spirit**, by the **Word** and **sacraments**. Within that economy, **union with Christ** delivers the **duplex gratia** of **justification** and **sanctification**, along with **adoption**, **perseverance**, and **assurance**. These benefits are distinct yet inseparable, forensic yet transformative, and they resist both moralism and antinomianism. **Imputation** anchors the legal verdict; **participation** animates the life of holiness; both come together in the **unio mystica**. The structure is Calvinian and classically **Reformed**, enriched by a catholic appetite that respects the **Creator-creature distinction** and the **extra Calvinisticum**.

This synthesis has implications for the doctrine of the **church**. Because union is ecclesially enacted and nourished, believers are not isolated recipients of discrete benefits but members of the **body of Christ**, where sanctification is communal and sacramental. The **preached Word** is the instrument of faith that unions, and the **Supper** is the sign and seal that strengthens. The church’s discipline guards the integrity of union by calling believers back to **Christ**. The shape of the Christian life is cruciform and resurrectional, mirroring the **historia salutis** in the **ordo salutis**. The net effect is a Reformed account both sturdy in **confessional** essentials and spacious in catholic sympathies.

In a Reformed and Westminster Theological Seminary evaluation, Garcia’s retrieval of **union with Christ** and **duplex gratia** is a salutary tonic that resists fragmentation in soteriology and guards the gospel’s center in **Christ himself**. The principal tension to watch is conceptual: the insistence that **justification** and **sanctification** are inseparable in union must not be heard to blur their formal distinction or the exclusive ground of **justification** in **imputed righteousness**. A WTS-style alternative phrasing would stress the logical priority, within union, of the **forensic verdict** for the conscience while fully affirming the simultaneous communication of **sanctification** by the **Spirit**. Caution is also warranted in deploying **participation** or **theosis** language so that it remains covenantal and pneumatic, never metaphysical or ontological. Within these classical boundaries, Garcia’s synthesis powerfully integrates **revelation**, **covenant**, **grace**, **history**, and **nature** in a way that honors **Westminster** theology and enriches the church’s preaching and sacramental life.
