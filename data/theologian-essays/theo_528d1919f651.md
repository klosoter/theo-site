### ESSAY
#### 1. Formation, setting, and method
Norman Shepherd emerged within the postwar **Westminster Theological Seminary** tradition shaped by **Geerhardus Vos** and **John Murray**, where redemptive-historical exegesis and **biblical theology** sought to recalibrate the relation between **ordo salutis** and **historia salutis**. Appointed to the WTS faculty in 1963, he absorbed a strong commitment to **covenant** as the architectonic category of **Reformed theology**, a suspicion toward scholastic dualisms, and an insistence on reading **justification** and **sanctification** within **union with Christ**. Situated in the Dutch-American stream influenced by **Herman Bavinck** and **Klaas Schilder**, he wanted to overcome an abstract **law-gospel antithesis** by locating both law and gospel within the one **covenant of grace**. His method was deliberately exegetical, drawing heavily on **Romans**, **James**, **Deuteronomy**, and prophetic covenant lawsuit texts, and it bore the mark of WTS commitments to **Van Tilian presuppositionalism** and anti-autonomous exegesis.

The institutional and intellectual climate of the 1960s and 1970s also framed Shepherd’s trajectory. Debates about the **covenant of works**, the scope of **imputation**, and the coherence of **Westminster Standards** with a redemptive-historical emphasis were live issues among colleagues such as **Meredith G. Kline**, **O. Palmer Robertson**, and **Richard B. Gaffin Jr.**. In this crucible, Shepherd’s theological posture aligned with **John Murray’s** questioning of the prelapsarian **covenant of works**, his emphasis on **union with Christ**, and his reluctance to deploy a sharp **law-gospel dichotomy**. Shepherd’s methodological thesis crystallized: the church must speak of **faith**, **repentance**, and **obedience** as integrally related acts of covenant response, not as separable stages parceled out across the **ordo salutis**.

From early on, Shepherd’s classroom messaging pressed a semantic and theological claim about **faith**. Faith in Scripture, he argued, is not a bare fiducial assent but **obedient faith**, a covenantal loyalty that embraces Christ and follows him. He appealed to the biblical idiom of *pistis* as allegiance and to Pauline and Jacobean texts where **faith working through love** and **faith completed by works** are central. This lexical and theological move set the trajectory for his later formulations on **justification**, **final judgment according to works**, and **covenant objectivity**.

#### 2. The controversy at Westminster, 1975–1981
The conflict that would define Norman Shepherd’s reputation entered public view in 1975 at **WTS**, intensified through memoranda and faculty deliberations, and culminated with his departure in 1981. At its core were Shepherd’s formulations on **justification by faith alone**, his use of **obedient faith**, his reading of **Romans 2** and **James 2**, and his ambivalence toward the **imputation of the active obedience of Christ**. Critics charged that he collapsed the instrumental cause of **justification** into its fruits by construing justifying faith as inherently obedient, thereby reintroducing **works** into the instrument of justification and moving toward **neonomianism**. Defenders countered that he preserved **sola fide** while exegetically insisting that genuine faith is always penitential and obedient.

In 1979 Shepherd circulated his **Thirty-four Theses on Justification in Relation to Faith, Repentance, and Good Works**, attempting to clarify that **good works** are not the ground or co-instrument of **justification** but are inseparable from the **faith** that justifies. He affirmed **imputation** and denied justification by works, yet maintained that the future **judgment according to works** in Romans 2 is not hypothetical. He also rejected the notion of prelapsarian **merit** and the strict **covenant of works** schema, proposing instead a comprehensive **covenant of grace** that encompasses all of redemptive history, with law as covenant stipulation rather than meritorious probation. For some colleagues like **Meredith Kline**, this disturbed the classic **law-gospel** grammar and undermined the **Westminster Confession’s** two-covenant structure. Faculty debates, board interventions, and ecclesial reviews failed to reconcile the parties, and in 1981 Shepherd left **WTS**, an event that foreshadowed later controversies over the **Federal Vision**.

#### 3. Constructive proposals and key works
After leaving the seminary, Shepherd continued writing and ministry, providing a fuller account of his program in **The Call of Grace: How the Covenant Illuminates Salvation and Evangelism** in 2000 and **The Way of Righteousness: Justification Beginning with Moses** in 2007. In The Call of Grace he advances **covenant objectivity** as the frame for evangelism and discipleship: God’s promise in the **covenant** addresses households, the **sacraments** publicly mark people off as belonging to Christ, and the call entails **repentance**, **faith**, and **obedience** as a single covenantal response. He emphasizes the pedagogical role of **law** within the **covenant of grace**, presenting **holiness** as the path of life and warning that covenant breakers face real judgment. This covenantal framing, he argues, liberates from individualistic or voluntarist accounts of **conversion** while disciplining evangelism by ecclesial means of grace.

In **The Way of Righteousness**, Shepherd elaborates a canonical argument that **justification** cannot be properly taught if it is abstracted from the **Pentateuch**, particularly **Deuteronomy**. He claims that Paul’s teaching in **Romans** and **Galatians** presupposes Deuteronomic categories of covenant blessing and curse, and thus that **justification by faith** must be read in continuity with **obedience** as the covenant path. He stresses **Romans 2:13** that the doers of the law will be justified as an eschatological verdict for those in **union with Christ**, arguing that this is not a hypothetical statement but a real description of the believer’s Spirit-wrought obedience. At the same time, he insists that the sole ground of **justification** remains the **righteousness of Christ**, and that **faith** is the instrument. The contested point remains his insistence that the instrument is **obedient faith**, which for Shepherd names the guaranteed fruitfulness of Spirit-enabled covenant fidelity, not a second instrument.

Across these works Shepherd rejects a strict **law-gospel antithesis** and denies the **covenant of works** as meritorious probation. He follows **John Murray** in questioning prelapsarian **merit** and aligns with strands of Dutch Reformed stress on the unity of **covenant of grace**. The theological payoff he seeks is a thick description of **union with Christ** such that **justification** and **sanctification** are distinct benefits yet inseparable under the one **duplex gratia**. For Shepherd, the forensic and renovative are joined in the person of Christ and his Spirit, and **faith** cannot be parsed as a non-obedient instrument without violating the biblical witness to *pistis* as allegiance.

#### 4. Faith, works, and judgment according to works
The heart of Shepherd’s contribution lies in his contested construal of **faith and works**. He adopts the Reformed axiom that **good works** are necessary as the way to life, though not the ground of acceptance, yet he relocates this necessity inside the very definition of **faith**. He frames **James 2** not as a discussion of demonstrative vindication before humans but as an apostolic insistence that **justifying faith** is the kind of faith that inevitably obeys. He reads **Romans 2** affirmatively, contending that the apostle envisages a real **final judgment according to works** that is coordinate with the first-justification-by-faith verdict. Thus he uses biblical-theological categories to keep **justification**, **sanctification**, and **assurance** within **union with Christ** rather than dividing them across an analytic ordo.

Closely tied to this is Shepherd’s cautious handling of the **imputation of the active obedience of Christ**. While he affirms that Christ’s righteousness is the ground of **justification**, his writings dwell less on a discrete active-obedience imputation and more on the whole Christ as the believer’s righteousness. Critics concluded that he effectively displaced the confessionally affirmed **active obedience** as imputed to the believer. Shepherd replied that he has no soteriology without **imputation**, but that the biblical accent falls on Christ himself rather than on a partitioned obedience. The point is not a denial of **forensic righteousness**, he argues, but a holistic union-driven imputation that bears the fruits of **obedience**.

#### 5. Covenant objectivity, sacraments, and perseverance
Shepherd’s theology of **covenant objectivity** radiates into ecclesiology and sacramentology. He asserts that in the administration of the **covenant**, God really binds a people to Christ through the **means of grace**, so that baptism, rightly received, marks genuine incorporation into the covenant community. This objectivity underwrites the church’s assurance that the **promise** is for us and for our children, while simultaneously sharpening the warning texts that those within the **covenant** can apostasize as **covenant breakers**. Shepherd refuses a bare visible-invisible church dichotomy that would flatten the church’s address by making sacramental incorporation merely nominal. Rather, he argues that the **Word and sacrament** economy is the real field in which **faith**, **repentance**, and **obedience** are called forth and sustained by the Spirit.

This ecclesial posture helps explain both Shepherd’s evangelistic emphasis in **The Call of Grace** and later affinities claimed by the **Federal Vision** movement. While Shepherd did not author the **Federal Vision** statements, his stress on **covenant objectivity**, corporate identity, and a non-dualistic relation of **faith and obedience** created clear lines of influence. The controversies in the **PCA** and **OPC** during 2002–2007 over the **Federal Vision** often traced certain positions back to Shepherd, especially on **justification**, **baptismal union**, and **final judgment according to works**. Shepherd, for his part, framed his views as retrieval of biblical **covenant** categories consonant with historic **Reformed** teaching once the grammar of **union with Christ** is recovered.

#### 6. Relation to the New Perspective and Reformed debates
Shepherd’s articulations predate the **New Perspective on Paul**, yet the parallels provoked debate. His relocation of **works of the law** into the covenantal, his interest in **Deuteronomy** as a matrix for Paul, and his insistence on faith as covenant loyalty were read as converging with elements of **E. P. Sanders** and later **N. T. Wright**. Shepherd rejected these comparisons as misdirected, reiterating his affirmation of **imputation** and **penal substitution** and distancing himself from ecclesiological readings that undermine forensic **justification**. Still, the structural similarity remains at key points, which explains the heated **Reformed** reception, where concerns about the integrity of **sola fide** and the **Westminster** doctrine of **imputation** are central.

Within intra-Reformed discussion, Shepherd functions as a catalyst for clarifying the relation between **ordo salutis** and **historia salutis**. On one side, voices aligned with **Vos** and **Gaffin** appreciate his insistence on **union with Christ** and on the eschatological shape of Christian existence, including the serious place of **final judgment according to works** as vindication. On the other, those shaped by **Kline** and classical federal categories contend that the **covenant of works**, including a typological republication at Sinai, is essential for maintaining both the purely **forensic** basis of **justification** and the doxological function of **good works** as fruit rather than instrument. Shepherd’s work, as much in reception as in proposition, thus surfaces the fault lines in modern **Reformed** soteriology.

#### 7. Conceptual stakes and doctrinal development
The conceptual center of Shepherd’s project is the redefinition of **faith** as inherently obedient, in order to resist antinomian readings and to honor biblical **covenant** idiom. This flows from a unified doctrine of **duplex gratia** where **justification** and **sanctification** are inseparable benefits of **union with Christ** without conflation. It also rests on a canonical insistence that **law** and **gospel** are not competing regimes but coordinate features of the **covenant of grace**. Consequently, he seeks to relativize the **covenant of works** and the associated merit schema in favor of a single **covenant** unfolding from Adam through Christ. His doctrine of **assurance** becomes corporate and ecclesial, grounded in the promises signified in **Word and sacrament**, and verified in the pilgrim’s **perseverance** in **obedience**.

Doctrinally, Shepherd strives to thread a needle. He wants to uphold **justification by faith alone** and **imputation**, to avoid synergism by rooting obedience in **union with Christ**, and to protect the necessity of **good works** in a way pastorally effective for preaching and catechesis. His vocabulary of **obedient faith** is the focal strategy. By making obedience an inseparable property of faith, he hopes to describe the same reality from two angles rather than to add a second instrument. His appeal to **Romans 2**, **James 2**, and **Galatians 5** is exegetically serious and coheres with his redemptive-historical method.

#### 8. Reception, influence, and legacy
The reception of Norman Shepherd has been as contested as any late twentieth-century **Reformed** figure. At **WTS** his proposals precipitated a defining institutional crisis that clarified faculty commitments to the **Westminster Standards** on **justification**, **imputation**, and the **covenant of works**. In the broader ecclesial scene, the 2000s debates over the **Federal Vision** in **PCA** and **OPC** synods relied on Shepherd-era categories to articulate concerns and boundaries. Study committee reports in 2006–2007 warned against formulations that collapse **faith and works** in **justification**, that render **baptismal union** as conferring the same benefits on all recipients, and that obscure the **imputation of Christ’s active obedience**. Yet Shepherd’s emphasis on **union with Christ**, on redemptive-historical exegesis, and on the reality of **judgment according to works** has also helped Reformed pastors and theologians to teach the necessity of **holiness** without denying **sola fide**.

Shepherd’s legacy is therefore dialectical. He sharpened attention to the biblical warrant for **obedience** as covenantal necessity and corrected antinomian misreadings of **faith** as a bare decision. He also helped push **Reformed** exegesis to grapple afresh with **Romans 2**, **James**, and **Deuteronomy**, and to rethink **assurance** and ecclesial formation within the objectivity of the **means of grace**. The abiding question is whether his terminological choices, especially **obedient faith**, can safely carry these gains without eroding the confessional grammar of **justification**.

#### 9. Reformed and WTS evaluation
A measured **Reformed/WTS** evaluation must acknowledge both the strengths and risks in Shepherd’s proposals. Positively, his redemptive-historical method, stress on **union with Christ**, and insistence on the eschatological seriousness of **obedience** retrieve genuine biblical accents. His ecclesial focus on **Word and sacrament** and **covenant** provides salutary ballast against moralistic voluntarism. Yet on confessional grounds several tensions remain. First, by defining the instrument of **justification** as **obedient faith**, he blurs the classic distinction between instrument and fruits, endangering the integrity of **sola fide** as confessed in the **Westminster Standards**. Second, his rejection or marginalization of the **covenant of works** and prelapsarian **merit** severs a federal logic that safeguards the purely **forensic** basis of **justification** in the **imputation of Christ’s active and passive obedience**. Third, his strong version of **covenant objectivity** risks conflating visible administration with saving **union**, complicating **assurance** and the doctrine of **perseverance**. A constructive alternative within classical **Reformed orthodoxy** would retain Shepherd’s biblical-theological gains while clarifying that **faith alone** is the sole instrument of **justification**, that **good works** are necessary as evidences and means of sanctified life but never co-instrumental, that the prelapsarian **covenant of works** and its typological republication safeguard the law-gospel grammar, and that **union with Christ** delivers a real **duplex gratia** where **justification** and **sanctification** are inseparable yet non-confused benefits.
